Subject: Re: [T2] AC in '74 Bus

&gt;Gotta disagree here.  Freon + moisture = hydrocloric acid.
&gt;
&gt;If you disconnect one it should be sealed as tightly as possible....if it
&gt;has already been open to the atmosphere, just seal it well cause you will
&gt;pay the price later.

If the system was left open (hoses off or whatever) - wouldn't the Freon 
evaporate leaving the system damage free.

In other words - I have 2 systems and pieces of a third stored (1.5 bus and 
1 Beetle). Should I get home and pull a vacuum on the system and seal the 
evaps and condensers?

What do you flush the evap and condensers with before they go back into 
service?

FWIW I plan to use both systems with rotary compressors - bus will be 
Corvair powered by then and the Beetle is Type IV powered (all custom 
shrouding so not stock bus with the thin pulley).

Any new info on the good, bad, and ugly of replacement refrigerants? No 
R-12 for me. I bought a 30 pound cylinder (was it 30?) back in '95 to store 
for later and the damn thing leaked all of it out within a year . Lots of 
$$$ gone poof!
