Hi,
    Today I thought I'd be driving my bus with a newly rebuilt AVP
engine, but alas, it was not to be. I tried to prime the engine as the
Wilson book says to do before actually starting it by removing the wire
&gt;from the condenser to the negative terminal of the coil so the bus won't

actually start, and then running the starter for 30-60 seconds til the
oil pressure light goes out and then a little longer. Well, I kept that
starter going until it was slowing down a fair amount and the light
never went out. I tried it several times, but no go. I considered just
starting the engine, but was concerned that maybe there really is not
enough oil pressure happening. I surveyed the engine and there are no
major oil leaks, just a small one around the sump plate I replaced. I
think AVP puts in a new pressure senders with their rebuilds. So I'm
clueless. Any ideas?
