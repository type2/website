Subject: Re: [T2] Long Mirror

The long mirror allows me to see behind the vehicle, PERIOD with the AC unit 
above and behind my head.  The original 'short' mirror just reflects an 
image of the unit itself...

Eron

&gt;... I was curious about the &quot;long mirror&quot; thing...
&gt; &gt; 2. The long stem mirror improves the rear visibility as it allows  the
&gt;driver
&gt; &gt; to look back down the road at length, rather than down onto the road
&gt; &gt; directly behind the bus.
