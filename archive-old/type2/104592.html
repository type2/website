&lt;&lt;  I think i'm going to put classic insurance on it if that 
helps.  And yes i know since i'm 17 i'm going to get screwed with high 
insurance.  Thanks for the help everyone.

If you get classic/antique ins. at least here in the USA, you may get
insured, but you may not be able to drive the Bus...Policies vary, but
most want a garage queen that only comes out for parades and shows.
Don't get caught with a loaf of bread in the Bus, or they'll claim you
were shopping...Also most policies limit mileage (and want to see the
odometer)...
