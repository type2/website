Subject: Re: Rear hatch (was [T2] RE: Sliding Door)
Cc: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Some ingenious person (Judy was it you?) rigged a pull ring to the 
lick mechanism on the rear hatch of the out 67 bus. I recall playing 
with the rear latch on the inside of  the old 72 and was able to 
reach in and pop it open form the rear. Get some bailing wire and rig 
a pull cord .
&gt;You know I always wondered about being able to open the rear hatch from
&gt;the inside of my van.  There's a hole at the bottom-center on the inside
&gt;of the hatch where it looks like a mechanism for such could exist.  Am I
&gt;missing some hardware?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
