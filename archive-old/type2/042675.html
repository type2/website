Subject: RE: broken exhaust bolts

Man.  I deleted this message because I did not want to remember my
experiences with exhaust bolts but I felt like you might need the
forewarning.  I bought an Empi header and upon removing the old, snapped the
exhaust manifold stud.  I thought that was no big deal and would be a great
opportunity to replace the rusty studs.  Well, all the old studs came out
just fine with a small pipe wrench ($20 from Home Depot) except the last one
snapped flush with the head surface.  I bought an expensive drill bit and an
easy out and began to drill away.  The drill bit snapped, yes children,
that's right....flush with the stud and flush with the head.  I tried to
drill around it....no luck  Damn!!!  It was machine shop time.  I spent
hours, mind you attempting to take this one tiny bastard stud out.  When I
got the heads off to take to the machine shop after yanking the motor, I
found that it was cracked and needed to be replaced anyway.  This is what I
refer to as &quot;Justin luck&quot;.

&gt; Is there a preferred way to remove them, other than dousing the hell out
of
&gt; them with penetrating fluid and putting a visegrip on them?  I don't have
&gt; access to a welder to weld a bolt head or nut of any sort on them.  Am I
&gt; asking for trouble with my visegrip method?

The only problem with using a vise grip to remove a bolt is that you'll ruin
the threads on the bolt. Since this bolt is going straight in the trash the
instant you get it out, I somehow doubt you care about the threads on it.

Douse away.
