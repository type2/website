&lt;&lt; Recently rebuilt Tatra V-8 engine for sale or trade in middle TN.

This a small aircooled V-8 engine from an early 80's Tatra. It has been 
modifed to run GM fuel injection and comes with a full set of shop manuals 
and a box full of repair parts. &gt;&gt;

Hey, I'm interested...I'm thinkin' about upgrading my Fitch Phoenix or maybe
makin' my Yenko Stinger into a real Vette-eater...(wink, wink ;-)
