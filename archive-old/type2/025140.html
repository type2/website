As in life, like women(no offense to our Female Volks), there will be
others! :-)

Thank You,

I'm just sick.  Pretty sure that I passed up looking at this bus last
year - the guy only wanted a coupla grand for it, it sounded too good to
be true, and I'd just bought Walter.  I came to my senses the next
morning but it was too late.

I am too stupid to live.

Teri
