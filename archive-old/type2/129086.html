Subject: UPDATE

Hello,

Just wanted to update that Paul was right, I was able to take
the fan housing out of the van with the engine in.
I was also able to take the heads and cylinders out with the
engine in the van. The part that takes the longest is the 'tin'
Once you take the fan housing out its amazing how much more room you have to
work with getting the heads and cylinders out.

Later,
Darren
