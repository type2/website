Subject: [T2] Please help me start this old bus!

do youn know anything about this bus ?

did it run when it was parked ?  never believe the old  owner 100%, after 5 
years he may not remember.....

my idea is  spend the least you have to until you know you have something to 
work with....

drain the oil and check it for chunks or if there is water in it......
check the valves clearance, thats free
pull the spark plugs and see if they are oily, watery or chunks out of it, 
thats free
put some oil down the plug holes.....
now see if the motor turns over all the way without clunking by hand

so far you have spent no money and at least have an idea that the motor turms 
over.......

now do a compression test , put fresh oil in it but pull the 12v to the coil  
and clamp the fuel line so it does not pump bad gas into the motor........

hopefully you now have good compression........

if you have gotten this far and everything seems good , them go spend the 
money on new fuel lines, filters , new plugs etc

I just do not see  spending money if the motor is junk, unless you plan on 
putting another motor in it anyway.......
