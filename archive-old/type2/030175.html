it can be damn frustrating becuse it can be in there pretty good.
I filed a thin (1/8&quot;) screwdriver down and made a lip on it to grab the
inner edge of the seal. still was a bit of effort.
ascii attempt to describe screwdriver tip filing...

I hope that helps. the problem I found is that the shaft is in the way of
most prying attemps. this tool can slip in next to the shaft and grab the
steel ring of the seal from behind tug and work around be patient bring a
radio and a glass of iced tea.
