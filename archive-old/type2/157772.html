Subject: Re: [T2] what socket

OR, a triple square socket, depending upon what the bolts take,  Allen and
triple square do not interchange!

&gt; On this subject...make SURE you use backing plates
&gt; (three per CV) and brand-new lock-washers (available
&gt; from VW dealers) when you re-install the CV bolts.

I use OEM serrated washers and backing plates and reuse them with no
problems.  I think that the original serrated washers and plates are
superior to the &quot;new&quot; stuff coming along now.

&gt; Also don't use anti-sieze and keep the bolts and their
&gt; holes free of CV grease.

I use anti-sieze and simply retorque the bolts to the factory torque
values after driving a few miles.
I've heard enough horror stories about stuck CV bolts that I don't want to
risk those things siezing up.  One more crawl-under is well worth it to
me and I've never had a joint loosen up on me after the retorque.
