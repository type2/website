Subject: Clutch slowly going- WHY?

I've been having to push the clutch pedal lower and lower to the 
floor for it to disengage. I have adjusted the cable twice now, and 
it's good after that, but after a couple days, it's back to being 
bad. This all happened after my accelerator cable broke while I was 
downtown, so I had to use a rubber band to keep the carb open, about 
3k at idle. I was able to drive home, but I had to eat alot of 
clutch. Then the clutch problems started. I originally thought that 
it is my clutch wearing thin, but the more I think about it, it seems 
like it's only the cable that needs replacing. It DOES NOT slip when 
in gear, it's just hard to get it into gear and it feels like I need 
to push the pedal farther than it can go to get the clutch to 
disengage. Any thoughts?
Thanks
Joel
