Hi Jamie.

Glad to read of your successful flywheel removal and seal transplant..

On to other matters:

For me any weekend but 4-6 would be great (my wife will be out of town and I
will be taking care of the kids). Also, there is a Fall Cookout in Charlotte
NC on the 6th that could compete..

The next weekend has a conflict with Oktoberbus the 11th-13th in Harmony, NC
that might drain off some would-be campers. So may I suggest the 18th-20th?
Leaves should be at there peak at that date, and the crisp fall weather
ideal.

I'm only a few hours away and was already thinking of a weekend camping
there even before your post.

Cheers,

John Rogers

&gt; Hi List,
&gt; At 'Shore up your Bus', we discussed the possibility of having an October
&gt; camp-out in Harpers Ferry, WV.  It will be a beautiful time of the year
for
&gt; a camp-out with the foliage on the Blue Ridge changing. There is lots to
do
&gt; in the area, with the Potomac and Shenandoah rivers meeting at Harpers
&gt; Ferry, there is a possibility of tubing or kayaking,  the Appalachian
Trail
&gt; and the C&amp;O Canal appeal to hikers, and there's lot's of history in
&gt; historic Harpers Ferry.  Here's a camp-out for the MD, VA, Metro
Washington
&gt; DC folk who do not want to travel to far from home.I was wondering what
&gt; week-end in October would be the best for the locals.  Let me know!  You
&gt; can drop me a line at airhead_at_acvw_dot_com
