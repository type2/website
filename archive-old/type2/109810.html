Subject: cylinder head changes

volks,
sorry to bother everyone on their lazy sunday! my questions is this. what
is the standard stock bore size for 1600cc heads and what is it for
1800cc. also, what is the the standard valve size over the years. i am
purchasing heads for my 1800cc, but found a decent deal on what i think
are 1600 heads. i have to choose between 40x32, 44x37.5, &amp; 42x37.5 valve
sizes. also, is there any signifigant risk in opening up the bore on 1600
heads? one other thing, can anyone explain to me exactly what &quot;porting&quot;
is?
thanks tons. all of you listees are more help than i can explain,
will
