There is a huge difference!

I do have a plea.  If anyone has original German heater boxes, Please DO
NOT trash them even if they are heavily rusted and you put nice new ones
on your bus.  If you can't
rebuild them yourself, at least take them to a VW meet and give them to
someone who can.  The shells can be patched pretty easily, but the
castings are really hard to duplicate

&gt; That said, I haven't heard anything about Dansk moving production to China

It might be good if they did.  The Chinese are pretty good at heavy iron
castings!  :)
