Subject: bed brackets

i ordered brackets from busdepot that turn your back seat of your van into a folding down ned like the westies. The only problem is that the instruction they said 2 pages were in germany and the other one was in english but i must be from a different plant cause i don't understand it if anyone know what i am talking about please let me know because they are sitting on the floor in the box
