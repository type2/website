Subject: Amplified Audio?

Hello fellow vw people,
I have a question about installing an amplifier into my 1970 type2.  I have 
put the amp into the bus, but it tends to cut out.  It will work for a 
while, but then it shuts down.  Is my battery powerful enough to run the 
amp?  I had a 60 watt amp that ran fine, but the new one is a 100 watt amp 
and it cuts out.  Any suggestions will be helpful.
thanks,
Rick Meier
