well...my life is over.  yesturday i got in an accident that was my fault, 
making a left turn from a center lane and a pretend off road thingy hit me.  
Unfortunately i was driving my friends Volvo, which is now totalled, and 
probably totalled the other guys car, they will probably also sue me because 
their son said his ribs hurt and went to the hospital even though he was the 
furthest from the impact.  My friend also didnt have collision.
So now i owe
1)my friend a new car
2)the increase on his insurance premium which will be out the roof
3)probably the other guy a new car
4)a ton when the other guy sues me for &quot;mental anguish&quot;

anyway my point of all this before everyone starts telling me this is off 
topic which is the last thing i care about. is i am going to have to sell my 
bus and get a job.

1972 Volkswagen Westfalia Campmobile
120,000mi, 5000mi on rebult engine
1700cc Porche Pancake engine
Twin weber single barrel carbs w/ new airfilters
New Michelin XZX tires
New tailpipe tip, exaust in good shape
New brakes all around (power assisted discs in front, drums in back) new 
rotors
New front end (axle etc....) from a 73 bus.
New eletric fuel pump, fuel lines, gas tank screen, two fuel filters
New battery
Soon it will have a new clutch cable, the was also replaced a few years ago

Body is solid, two small holes that started in the front wheel wells have 
been patched and sealed over.  no rot anywhere.

Pop-top fiberglass in great shape
Canvas and cot in good shape
Nice curtains all around
Double bed
Sink w/ eletric pump, cooler w/ ice tray and rack, all drains work properly
Another seat behind the driver seat
Nice wooden floor, wooden headliner in great shape
good rubber floor mats in cabin and hallway
all cabinets and woodgrain in great shape
wooden rear door and wall panels are starting to fade but in pretty good shape
locking engine hatch &amp; gas cap
new heat channel from engine to front
heat exchangers and risers in good shape
aux heat booster

it currently has a Blaupunkt in dash Cd-player /w remote nicely fitted in the 
radio spot, and 6 1/2 oversided 3 way Blaupunkt speakers in each cabin door, 
but i might take that out if i sell it.

front windsheild rubber needs to be replaced (i have the rubber and will try 
and do it soon).
it also needs new left and right heater boxes (althought the heat does work, 
i just have them wired open, but they're rusty so they really need to be 
replaced.

it also would need a final paint job, I primed and painted it to keep it from 
rusting badly over the winter, but i now cant afford to give it the final 
coat.
I also primed, painted, and undercoated much of the undercarriage, and 
undercoated the wheel wells.

i live in upstate ny, 30 mins from plattsburgh, 45 from lake placid, 2 1/2 
hrs from Albany.  i'd like to try and get $4500 or best offer, or maybe even 
a trade, or partial trade or something like that.

thanks for your time,
shawn &quot;Captain Tripps&quot; smithson

i will try and get some pictures on the computer if people want them.
