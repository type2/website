Subject: 65' brake system question

Hi, I have a 65' Splitty that I'm restoring. When I was taking it off the trailer that we transported it on, the brake pedal gave way, and went from having pressure to none at all. The pedal just goes to the floor, and will stay there unless I flip it back up with my shoe or something. Now I know that this could be a couple of things, master cylinder, wheel cylinders. I plan on replacing all the hydrolic parts of the system in the near future, but don't have enough money for them right now. I am placing a order for parts today, so I can work on it on my vacation next week, and was hoping that someone might have expierenced this before and could tell me what it could be so I can order the part.....
thanx,
Tracy
