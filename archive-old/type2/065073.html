Subject: Re: EV Battery goes out with a BANG!!!

&gt;
&gt;It would cost me a lot less time &amp; aggravation to just buy a decent
&gt;battery and use it, but, well, sometimes they push the wrong
&gt;buttons... 
&gt;
&gt;I'll write more as things progress...

I hear that one.  I don't know what happened to &quot;the customer is always
right.&quot;  Apparently it doesn't apply to vehicle sales.  In your case, if you
haven't done ANY modifications with anything even REMOTELY connected to the
EV's electrical system, give 'em hell!  I would think a visit with the
dealership's Mgr. or maybe a call to the regional sales Mgr. would help
things along.

I really, really want a new TDI Jetta but with all these VW customer
relation stories, I'm not too sure.  I've never had a new vehicle before but
if I ever do, the damn thing better be perfect and stay perfect or it's
going back!

Ok, anyway, I'd press the issue.  It's not always about money, after all.
