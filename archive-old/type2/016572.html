Subject: Re: Rivieras (Value of)

Randall,

There are two ways to measure the value of one's vehicle.  1. What is
someone willing to pay for it.  And 2. What's it worth to YOU.  I have a
Riviera.  We use it.  For what it was designed for.  We like it.  What's
it worth?  I paid $2400 for it.  I felt (and still feel) that I paid a
fair price.  Others may disagree.  Worth restoring?  Like I said before,
I use it.  If I wanted to show it, it would be worth restoring.

There were many conversion companies around in the late sisties and
seventies.  Most of them made a quality product.  Else VW wouldn't get
involved.  And VW was involved.  Remember, Westfalia was (is) just
another conversion company.  The current crop of VW campers are made by
Westfalia (not available in the USA) and Winnebago.  The Winnie is a
very nice piece of work.  Will it be worth more than the Westy in twenty
years?  Probably not.  Rarity will drive the prices up.  Will it be as
functional an RV as the Westy.  You bet.  Ya pays yer money and ya takes
yer choice.

All in all, my Riviera probably isn't &quot;worth&quot; as much as a similiar
Westy, but it does the job just as well, if not better than a Westy.
(And the Riviera easily sleeps four adults. The Westy, two adults and a
couple of small to medium sized kids.)

For the discussion about the history of the Riviera conversions, take a

YMMV

&gt; My friend has a Riviera camper, but until yesterday we never new exactly
&gt; what to call it. Apparently Rivieras were built on the West coast and we
&gt; rarely see them here in the Mid-west.  How do you east and west coast
&gt; V-dubbers feel about the Riviera?  The guy on the list who found one in the
&gt; salvage yard seemed pretty happy, but around here if it isn't a Westphalia
&gt; then nobody wants it.  Similar reaction to a Sundial camper I found
&gt; recently.  It appeared to be all there and in decent shape, but the owner
&gt; couldn't even sell it for the $500 he was asking.  It was a 64 deluxe with a
&gt; non-walkthrough Sundial camper interior.  My friends is a 78 with a
&gt; penthouse pop-top.  I know of at least one other in a salvage yard that also
&gt; has the penthouse pop-top.  Are these things collectible or worth
&gt; restoring?
