[Continued from Part 1]

My brother-in-law is shiftless, that is, he only drives automatic, so I
anticipated being fully caffeinated for the duration of the trip. I
considered teaching all the quirks of a 30 year old, butt sitting over the
front tire driven beast to a newbie, but those Pennsylvanian mountains
loomed ominously in the back of my mind's eye and there I saw my tired
destiny.  In a moment of love and pity, my wife unexpectedly boarded the bus
at the critical time of departure and announced she would be driving the
CT-Toronto-NYC leg and would leave us to suffer the round trip to Chicago.
I protested.  Yes, the miles would be draining.  But this trip was rich with
the potential for male bonding, and I could not allow feminist interests to
intervene.  We would have our rugged four day weekend across America's
interstates with all the freedom two men alone have to mess up the
directions, as well as rights to embellish with tales of dramatic hardship
overcome.  But my wife was not moved by my thoughtful, if not ridiculous
arguments.  She stuffed me in a sleeping bag in the cargo area and took
control of the vehicle, piloting us northwest toward Toronto.

With no interior to dampen the vibrations, the engine whined its shrill
3,700 rpm song for hours along the highway.  Proving I was a true bus
fanatic, if not somewhat deaf, the rpm lullaby put me to sleep.  It helped
that my wife handles the bus exactly as I do.  That comfort relaxed my mind,
and I dreamed off faintly hearing the shift points and decelerations in the
background as if my alter ego were driving.   I awoke somewhere outside
Rochester, New York.   At a gas stop there we met an aspiring bus owner.  He
had a '77 lined up to buy, but he'd only seen it in the dark.  I knew
exactly what he meant.  He was excited.  I was excited for him.  He'd been
enjoying Thom's Vintagebus page and I directed him to Type2_dot_com for further
reading.  He was one of the many people I would meet along this road to
Chicago who wanted a bus.  

We arrived in Toronto at nearly 3am and settled for a few hours nap.
Packing the bus was like trying to fit sardines from two cans into one.  We
had leftover sardines.  So out went the sardines (I mean of course, boxes)
and we stood them on their heads, pushed tails from one against the heads of
others and finally packed the bus with a solid mass, with just enough room
aft of the front seats for floor seating and for the additional boxes we
would retrieve in NYC, as well as the furniture stacked on the roof rack.
The furniture projections from the roof rack were offset by the improved
aerodynamics of the newly lowered bus.  The front wheels were considerably
closer to the wheel wells, the rears were becoming hidden by the body work.
I empathetically felt the tension of the torsion bars and leaf springs as if
they were straining within me.  I gave a cheerful thumbs up and my best race
winning smile, feigning the prospects of a successful journey.  I listened
for the creaking of the chassis as I crawled into the bus and assumed my
position on the floor between the seats. My wife slowly accelerated the
waddling bus onto the QEW.  

Not that we all don't know, but the VW bus is a marvel of engineering.  To
make a similar trip in a large diesel powered moving truck would amaze
nobody.  But filling an under-powered 30 year old bus to the brim with boxes
of text books, taxing the small engine to run at maximum rpm over the course
of days and expecting it to complete the journey successfully is the stuff
&quot;B&quot; movies are made of.

Crossing into the US through the checkpoint via the Canada/US border can be
a harrowing experience for VW bus drivers.  The randomly horrific
experiences faced by unlucky drivers are well chronicled in the digitized
lore found in the Type2 Archives.  Despite a few crossings in the bus, we've
not been searched.  Once, in a tidy '79 Buick Regal, our dirty laundry bag
was &quot;briefly&quot; seized and searched.  It was returned to us unscathed and of
course, still uncleaned.  Since I had already removed the camper interior
there was no chance that an impatient inspector could damage the dried wood
in an effort to track down an errant 30 year old roach under the floor
boards.  For an anxious moment I imagined them tearing apart the engine.
Still not so bad, but there I was without my Permatex 3H for case sealing!  

The line to the inspection station was 1/2 mile long, exacerbated by the
late coming cars attempting to cut ahead via the duty free parking lot
&quot;shortcut&quot;.  Our bloated van still had enough short term acceleration to
fend off a line cutting Lincoln Town car.  Its haughty driver steamed at
losing his unrightful place before our relic bus.  As the traffic jammed its
way over the bridge toward the station, we had ample time to read and
re-read an ironic sign warning would be photographers: &quot;No Stopping&quot;.  A
fortunately rational pack of drivers, we chose to exercise our civil
disobedience for practicality's sake.

Our bus magically passed through the checkpoint triumphantly.  Either we
looked too honest, our roof rack emitted a halo aura, or the boxes inside
simply looked too heavy.  The following hours down the highway were
uneventful.  We detoured through Hartford to drop off my wife and proceeded
at dawn toward our next stop in New York.  Arriving in the NYC suburbs, we
were greeted at the doorstep by my other brother-in-law, who was readying to
mow his severely overgrown lawn turned thicket.  I had arrived just in time
to repair the poor lawn mower, a task that appeared tied to my chances of
getting breakfast.  We layed over for a rest and added yet more heavy boxes
to the groaning bus.  The 8 ply tires bulged their discontent and I made a
note to add more air.  It was sometime in the early evening on Saturday when
we lumbered out of New York with our full load.  Our acceleration capability
had deteriorated further with the added weight and top speed suffered
especially on the grades, but the power was sufficient for at minimum a
right lane granny classification.  We were the Joad family on an Okie exodus
&gt;from the East with all worldly goods lashed to our trusty motorized mule.
We were the salt of the earth, lookin' for a job and honest pay.  The sun
was far from setting, but the imaginary setting sun glowed a large orange
and posed romantically over the western skyline as a tinny &quot;Red River
Valley&quot; played over the background noise on our AM radio.

Our idyllic departure was immediately dashed by the pot holed urban pavement
and toll booth reality.  Modern New York City has its own ambience, but it's
definitely not that of 1930s western highway and it's not in black and
white.  We guesstimated arrival and rest times and judged how much progress
we'd make across the unforgivably long state of Pennsylvania.   The slower
you drive, the more you notice.  In our case it meant a thorough study of
the black rubber skid tracks across the straight painted lanes, ending in a
large red blood spot and occasionally remaining deer carcass nearby.  The
disturbing number of these scenes, the now dark sky, and the light traffic
led me to my inevitable penchant of analyzing the odds.  Roughly calculated,
the passing car to deer demise scene ratio was about 3:1 for a given mile.
As I began adding other variables, we passed a pickup truck that had been
knocked sideways down an embankment and was in the process of being hoisted
out.  The driver's front fender had taken a heavy blow from the side above
the wheel, almost as if it had been head butted off the road by a
territorial, thick skulled deer.  No deer body in sight.  I then realized
the odds of the theoretical deer encounter I was attempting to formulate
were meaningless.  I was assuming a random, accidental occurrence.
Apparently deer in this area were actually targeting cars.  Tough rural
neighborhood.

As long as we weren't ambushed from the side, our slow speed was our only
defense in this war.  We passed a team of three deer eyeing us aside the
breakdown lane.  They must've radioed ahead, because after a few miles their
brother leapt over the fast lane border.  He suspended in mid flight for a
fraction of a second, the Air Jordan of deer, as if posing for one of the
orange and black deer warning signs or maybe a Nike commercial.  Jordan then
landed gracefully in the slow lane forty feet from our nose, perhaps looking
a bit perturbed to miss the easy slam dunk.  The grade had slowed us to
30mph, so we had ample time to stop.  Within seconds, a truck passed us at
high speed in the fast lane.  Had it passed slightly earlier, we would've
had front row seats to rural Jordan's retirement game.

Night time Pennsylvania melded into an Ohio dawn.  We were looking forward
to flat lands of Ohio and Indiana and happily left the mountains behind.
Stopping only for gas and food, we kept the bus engine pumping.  The array
of auxiliary gauges on the dash with their carefully pointed needles spoke
to its top condition and dispelled any worry.  At first we began to pick up
speed on the Ohio flats, then seemed to level off to a strangely slow pace.
I sought a plausible explanation and noticed the bending tall grass and
trees indicating a strong wind blowing against and at a slight diagonal to
our bow.  This must be the cause.  We sighed, liberated from the mountains,
and now a slave to the wind.  I regret to say that we drove at this speed
for hours, convinced of the power of the wind and maybe a bit too tired to
rationalize the problem further.  We had been trained for the past hours to
travel slow and we were carrying an abnormally large load that compounded
with a wind, could very well reduce our speed considerably.  Yet something
was not quite right.

For most of our trip we encountered friendly bus loving people, folks who
wanted to be or had been part of the bus sub-culture.  As we hit the one
lane construction areas that lasted for miles, we witnessed and admittedly
contributed to the ugly side of anti-bus sentiment.  We struggled to
maintain a decent minimum speed on some of these stretches, the wind pushing
against our face, an 18 wheeler's grill snuggled against our rear window.
As the bottle neck ended in two lanes a flurry of trucks and cars would
pass, but not before getting our attention with their horn so they could
earnestly flash the one fingered peace sign.  

I just hadn't expected the bus to be this slow.  I contemplated a Type IV or
Porsche engine installation project for the summer and my brother-in-law and
I joked about leaving a few boxes of the hardbound books along the highway.
At least he was joking.  Shortly after, as we sat at the toll booth I stared
at the tachometer's low idle reading.  Could it be?  The heavens opened and
a moment of revelation in the form of a backfire upon acceleration told the
full story.  All at once what should have been obvious before struck me.
The wind was an imaginary foe.  The true obstacle in our path that cost us
the last few hours of slow driving was simply my poor reasoning.  We pulled
off in the emergency lane a few hundred feet from the toll booths.  I yanked
my tach/dwell meter out of the glove compartment, knowing already what I'd
find.  Before departing on this journey, the first thing I checked was my
log book to determine the last time I had replaced the points.  I'm
notoriously stingy with a points set, squeezing every drop of life out of
them if I can.  I had installed these points only 3,000 miles ago.  A quick
check of the dwell before departure revealed a proper 49 degrees.  Now,
roughly 1500 miles later, the dwell read at 69 degrees.  Perhaps due to the
continuous duty and high revving through the night, the points were closing.  

Unfortunately, accessing a screw driver and the timing light required us to
unpack a heavy portion of the van. We noted the geometry of the box puzzle
so we could pack it all back tightly.  For me the easiest way to set points
is to make an initial adjustment by eye, then start the engine and check the
digital meter.  Typically the initial setting is a few degrees low, the next
try a few degrees high, and the third try is 50 degrees +/- 1 dead on.  I
explained to my brother-in-law what I was doing.  He's awed by the
mechanical world and found it interesting that I had these measuring gadgets
handy and was fascinated by the points set hiding under the distributor cap.
Within a few minutes we were back on the road--with about 30 percent more
power.  We accelerated past the wind and I scolded myself for my multiple
errors, first the rush to judgement against the wind and next the need for
tool excavation and especially for underestimating the power of the 1600.  I
still believed in the deer conspiracy though.  

Without sleeping, but with occasional stops for gas, the NYC to Chicago leg
of our journey took a whopping 23.5 hours.  We arrived in Chicago and my
brother-in-law began arrangements for unloading.  I lay across the two front
bucket seats with a luggage stuffed between the gap and ignoring the
discomfort, fell into a blissful sleep.  

With the bus unloaded, the suspension stretched back to its preferred
height.  We darted about Chicago's Lakeshore Drive light and nimble, a pixy
bus casting magic spells on the traffic around us.  At one stop a Chicagoan
marveled at the gauge setup on our dash,  &quot;Are all those functional?&quot;  You
bet!  The gauges lend an aircraft cockpit look to an otherwise wingless bus.
&quot;What kind of engine do you have in there?&quot;  That's when I should say it's a
Porsche six cylinder, but I usually admit it's just a well loved 1600.

We left the city at 12:01am tuesday with me yet determined to meet an 8am
deadline in Hartford the following morning.   We now had speed, but for much
of the return drive we would encounter rain storms.  The benefit of the rain
is that it distracts you from noticing the skid marks and road kill.  The
farmers of Indiana and Ohio might also suggest there are other
benefits--it's all a matter of perspective.   With a more relaxing drive and
ample rest stops, we reached home by 6am Wednesday, plenty of time to adjust
&gt;from life on the road to the less eventful sedentary world before a computer
screen.   Aside from the contact points mishap, we developed a puzzling
&quot;clunk&quot; that occurred late in our journey each time we hit a bump or braked
heavily.  That turned out to be a loose caliper bolt.  When I had removed
the caliper for the front end work, I hadn't used a torque wrench for the
installation as I customarily do.  No excuse for sloppy work.

So what does all this mean?  It means it's time for another oil change and
valve adjustment, there are plenty of long road trips ahead.  My bus...I
think I'll keep her...
