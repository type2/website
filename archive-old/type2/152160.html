&gt; &gt; Finally read something on this site that made me angry! Even allowing
&gt; &gt; for Eisenstein and the wave function effect across the metal/metal
&gt; &gt; boundary (if you don't know what these are, buy a very thick physics
&gt; &gt; book), for the time it takes the electronics to react to affect the
&gt; &gt; perceived timing by one degree (i.e. all the electrical delays in the
&gt; &gt; timing light leading to a delay in the flash), you would have to be
&gt; &gt; running your engine at 115 thousand rpm
&gt;
&gt; I have many thick physics books and I don't think that I'm going to cross
&gt; virtual swords with Stephen over this issue.
&gt;
&gt; Hmmm, Stephen... physics expert... UK addy...  Shouldn't your address end
&gt; in &quot;_dot_cam.ac_dot_uk&quot;, and how exactly do you get that wheelchair into your
&gt; bus?...  :)
