Subject: loud &quot;bang&quot; from brakes??

Hello everyone, thank you for your help with the last post.
Now I'm having a problem with the brakes, I think. ('77
standard bus) If you go into reverse and hit the brakes no
prob, it stops, ok with no noises that I can hear.  So then
once I start to go forward, and have to hit the brakes to
slow or whatever,all of a sudden  &quot;BAM!!!&quot; right when I have
the pedal down pretty good to stop. It sounds like the
backing plate or something is loose, once I go forward and
hit the brakes it resets back to where it originally was or
something? I have no idea what it could be, and worse off
yet, I don't have the right size tool to pull the rear axle
nuts off! What size are these by the way? Now she only does
it the one time going foward, or unless you  happen to go
into reverse again, or go backwards and hit the brakes to
stop while going backwards. Then once you go forward again
she'll do it for you again. Any help on this one would be
great!! Thanks. Mark B.  '77 Standard 1600cc
