OK, I'll scream, but for good reason.

The K&amp;N oiled-gauze filter is an excellent choice for racers who don't
want to DNF.  It isn't so good if you want you want long engine life.

What, are these are at cross purposes?  Yep, read on!

Think of what a racer, particularly an off-road racer, has as a goal.
Winning is certainly up there on the list, but to win you must first
finish.  It doesn't matter if the engine is trashed at the end, since they
are rebuilt anyway, but if they don't make it to the line you lose.  

If you don't run an air filter you will certainly DNF, as all the dust
inhaled will give you a new bore job along with clogging all the little
passages it can find.

If you run a good filter you might DNF as well, since it will clog with
all the stuff it is keeping out of the engine.

The oiled-gauze filter is a great compromise between these extremes.  It
filters out the
big particles, but has enough open space to keep the air flowing.  Sure, a
lot of small particulates find their way in, but they won't do all that
much damage in the short term.

Since racers don't care about the long-term, they find the oiled gauze
filter to be a great solution.

Since the winning racers use their product, K&amp;N would have us believe that
their filters are good for everyone.  Unfortunately, the ultimate goals of
bus owners and off-road racers are different.  The small partculates
allowed in by the oiled-gauze filters will do harm to your engine in the
long run.

Years ago, Dirt Bike magazine did a fairly complete (and surprising
rigorous in the scientific sense) comparision of the
available filters for off-road motorcycles.  Unfortunately, oil-bath
wasn't among them, but there was a clear difference between the filtering
ability of paper, oiled-foam, and oiled-gauze filters.  Paper was best,
but clogged rather quickly.  This is to be expected, since it was catching
everything.  Oiled foam was not quite as effective, and the oiled gauze
was effective, as they said, at &quot;keeping small birds out of your engine&quot;.

They were joking, but the numbers showed that the oiled-gauze filter was
particularly poor at filtering small particulates.

Think about that before selecting a filter.  Racer-boy hype doesn't
protect your engine.
