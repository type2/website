&gt; Well problems are never ending with my machine! It's great study but I
&gt; don't have time for it right now.

that's when they always time the problems, Murphy
&gt; 
&gt; I replaced the electronic ignition and coil last week and thought it was
&gt; running beautifully.  Today however, it suddenly wouldn't start (much
&gt; like before my replacement work). I checked the coil, electronic
&gt; ignition, distributor etc. and couldn't figure out what was wrong. It
&gt; turned over no problem but didn't sound like it was firing, even though
&gt; there was a spark coming from the coil.
&gt; 
&gt; Then, to my dismay, when I was looking at the distributor, I noticed
&gt; that the temp sensor right behind the distributor (meaning toward the
&gt; front of the vehicle) was in a pool of oil!!!! Oh My God! was the first
&gt; thing to come out of my mouth.

That is not a temp sensor, but the oil presure sender, they leak
occasionally, they are cheap ($2.49 from the Bus Depot) replace it and
that should solve that problem,  however it shouldn't have caused the
engine not to fire, I suspect that may have been the oil shorting out the
coil, when you cleaned it up you probably solved that problem

&gt; I listened to all the Engine sounds from the Type II Library and now
&gt; realize that my valves are loose and have been for quite some time.
&gt; (Sound from my bus is especially noticable on the left side of the
&gt; engine - same side as the temp sensor) Any connection??  I'm afraid so,
&gt; but I don't know much about the nitty gritty of a VW engine. I'm
&gt; learning but probably the hard way!!

not sure if the 77 has solid lifters or hyd lifters they are set up
differently be aware and follow the instructions in Bentley
