Subject: part for control panel 75 westy

I am looking for a little fuse/light thing that is necessary for my fridge to
run.  It goes on the panel mounted in the rear of the bus, on the drivers
side.  As one looks at the panel, it is on the very bottom, and says
something like &quot;10 volt max fuse&quot; and it is for the fridge.  It looks to me
as though a fuse fits in the hole, and a cover screws into place.  Anyone got
one of these little pieces laying around?  Anyone got a 75 deluxe in their
local boneyard?  Any help would be appreciated.   

also, I found a big water (?) jug in a 75 hardtop camper this weekend.  It
was in a cabinet that was NOT an original, although it may have been for a
different year, very big though.  Any way, the container says &quot;hunersdorff&quot;
 then under that it says &quot;plastic&quot; which I think means plastic :)    and
under that it says &quot;aus Hostalen&quot;
anyone have a clue what it means?  It is really cool.  Can I use it for Gas?
 

thanks a lot. 
dave
