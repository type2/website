Bearings are always a bit stiff until they run a few miles.  You also
have a bit more drag from the new seal.  I think that you've already
checked the end play and found it to be OK.

I'm a bit leery of Chinese bearings.  I've used SKF made-in-Mexico
bearings and they seem to work fine, though I prefer US or German if I
can get them.  I was lucky with my rear wheel bearings, as Ronnie at
Old Volks found a German set for me.
