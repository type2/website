Subject: Re: [T2] the thing between the fan and the crankshaft

I've removed the fan hub on different engines perhaps a dozen or so times
and I've always used the following technique:

Put some fairly heavy pieces of metal (I use big 'ol washers) behind the
&quot;ears&quot; of the hub, next to the case.  Insert your 3 fan bolts and tighten
then down until they just touch the metal pieces, effectively &quot;pining&quot; them
to the case.  Then go 'round and 'round tightening the bolts *very slightly*
(like, a 1/16th of a swing or so) and you'll eventually push the hub right
off.

Subject: [T2] the thing between the fan and the crankshaft
&gt;
&gt; The fan has been unbolted from the thing it bolts to (three bolts) and
&gt; the bolt/big washer thing has been removed from the end of the
&gt; crankshaft.  Now I can't remove the aforementioned thing the fan bolts
&gt; to.  I've tried banging it from behind with a hammer while prying the
&gt; other side with a screw driver and I've tried a light duty puller but it
&gt; doesn't seem to have moved at all.
