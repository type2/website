Subject: Won't start-was brown wire

Thanks for the feedback about the wire - I do believe it goes to the 
positive side of the coil.

However, I can not get the van to start.
I have checked double and triple checked wiring and vacuum lines and 
everything looks good
I replaced the distributor cap because I somehow cracked the old one
I tested spark well actually current from the coil via a meter and at 
number 1 plug wire while my wife turned the engine over and got voltage
Where do I go in problem solving next?
Any common mistakes things forgotten???
TIA - do not know what I would do with out this list!!!!!!!!
