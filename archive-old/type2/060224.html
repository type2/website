&gt;All,

&gt;from the distributor cap one at a time, there is a noticable decrease in
&gt;rpm, except in the number one cylinder.  Removing the spark plug wire from
&gt;that cylinder makes no difference in rpm.  When I pulled the wire and
&gt;tested it I got a fat blue spark from the wire to ground.  The spark plug
&gt;looks fine, although it has a little black soot on it and is covered with
&gt;gas.  What I am concerned about is could a spark plug look ok but not
&gt;carry a spark?  Also what braands of spark plugs would you recommend?

A compression check will tell all.  Sounds like you have low/no compression
in that cylinder.  For spark plugs, Bosch Platinum work great for me.
