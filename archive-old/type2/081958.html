Subject: Re: Rear Swaybar Question

Interesting idea.  I'm a bit skeptical about the temper or &quot;springiness&quot;
of the resulting part.

Many years ago I had the factory front swaybar break on a '68 Westfalia. 
The immediate result was a near rollover at 60+ MPH.

I still have that busted bar.  I've tried several times to recycle it
into something useful [prybar, etc.], without success.  Repeated heatings
to bright red hot have had no apparent effect on its original temper. 
Files hardly leave a mark, and I did much damage to a good quality
grinding wheel while trying to tidy up one of the jagged broken ends.

&gt;&gt;...tell 'em you need x feet of (insert size here) Stressproof® round
bar.

Read as much as you can then start designing and fabricating!&lt;&lt;
