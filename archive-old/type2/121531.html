Subject: Re: [T2] Removing the rear axle nut

&gt;large metric sockets:

&gt;
&gt;hydraulic press:
&gt;http://www.harborfreight_dot_com/cpi/ctaf/Displayitem.taf?itemnumber=1667

And then there is the Sears SAE equivalent that seems to fit pretty good. 1 
&amp; 13/16&quot; = $20. Remember you pay shipping sometimes with mail 
order.  Metric would be better of course. I do think my Sears socket came 
with the lifetime warranty. Much easier to use when it is over-the-counter 
vs. mail order.

I bought an import &quot;short&quot; extension and slide bar from a local supplier 
for less than $10.

Seems like I heard it is not particularly good to beat on hubs and other 
bearing supported shafts. For than reason I bought sockets for my Beetle 
and Bus after first using the &quot;beater&quot; wrench sold through some of the VW 
aftermarket suppliers. Seems like I may have lost a rear bearing b/c of one 
but I can't say that with surety.
