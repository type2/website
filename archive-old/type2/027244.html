Hello,

chances are there is a really good reason this wouldn't work, but
from someone who doesn't know all that much about electricity
it seems like a good idea to me.

Ok, I have a new westfalia. Its got one of those power hookup thingys
for when you camp someplace that allows you to plug your bus in, which I am 
guessing is usually an RV park or something, anyway its not important to me.
What I was thinking is this :

&quot;I wonder if I could hookup a power inverter to this plug in thing and 
connect that to a second battery?&quot;

Am I missing something pretty obvious that would make this not work?
If I am not, but it would require a little research and effort, I am all for 
it. Maybe I could somehow hook up a switch to toggle if I wanted to get 
power from the inverter versus the hookup, if I happen to be parked near a 
wall outlet. (hehe)



on a totally side note, I ordered a bunch of stuff on 1/31 from two of the 
bigger bus parts suppliers and was curious as to which would deliver the 
goods first since I played the orders both on the same day.

Today the delivery man rang and I sprang to see which had beaten to other 
only to see him standing there with one under each arm.

I wont name names but they rhyme with rus fetot and ro sesty.
