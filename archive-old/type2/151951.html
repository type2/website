Subject: Re: [T2] FI Fuel pump runs. And runs, and runs.

&gt; The AFM contact check will not help if the fuel pump is on even with the
&gt; ignition off.   The double relay is really a power relay and a fuel pump
&gt; relay. When the engine is stopped, all current to the FI system should
&gt; be stopped via the power relay in the double relay, although the relay
&gt; itself should still get current from the battery. I suspect something is
&gt; shorted in it and something is not wired right to the fuel pump. .

well I stopped by Andrews place Sunday (cute daughter helped) and we
finally figured out what the problem was.......but I promised Andrew I'd
give him a couple days to &quot;out&quot; himself before I rubbed it in....
