Hey there bus folks,

Just for kicks, I calculated the power required to push our busses on down
the road... the results are at http://www.instability_dot_com/vw/aero.html .

Now, I had to make lots of assumptions, but I was pleased that the results
aren't too far off from reality. It's interesting to note that, because
power required varies as the square of velocity, if you want to increase
your top speed you need to stuff a *really big* engine into your bus... to
go 80 mph, you need something like 80 rear-wheel horsepower, but getting
up to 90 mph requires nearly 120 hp!

Anyway, if someone cares to go measure the nose of a Vanagon, I'll do a
comparison ;-)  Likewise if anyone knows the Cd of a splitty...
