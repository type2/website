I got my can of &quot;Goof Off&quot; at Lowe's. You oughtta wear
gloves, or atleast don't try to wash POR 15 off of
your hands using &quot;Goof Off,&quot; like I did. Heh he..
Another method that could work, if you don't like the
razorblade idea is to wear leather gloves and heat the
film with a blow dryer, while peeling it up. I know,
there are pros and cons to this. You'll also need some
patience. 
                           For what it's worth,
                           Paul Deatherage
