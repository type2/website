Have I got a solution for you. Get some beebees or #2 birdshot or small
bearings, or just a half a handfull of small nuts and hardware and throw
them in there. Squirt it with solvent. Shake it like a rattle in all
directions. Rinse&amp;Repeat.... until no more crud is left. Shake out all the
hardware and blow dry. The little nuts 6mm across the flats work best, but
the 7 or 8mm size will do. I suppose a bunch of electric terminals might
even work. Just so long as nothing can get lodged in the outlets and can be
shaken back out, it will do.
