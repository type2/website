&gt;&gt; My 1980 air-cooled vanagon has excessive (1 quart in 500 miles) oil 
&gt;&gt; leak.  I have removed the cooling tin from the bottom of the motor and 
&gt;&gt; after wiping down the drips and running in place for 30 minutes, it 
&gt;&gt; appears that the oil is leaking from the push rod tubes and possibly the 
&gt;&gt; head gasket itself.  Is it possible for the head to be leaking oil or 
&gt;&gt; did oil collect in that area from the leaking push rod?  That area is 
&gt;&gt; the steel tin below the heads.

Depending on which cylinder the leak appears to be coming from, check above. Over #4 is the oil cooler. If it's leaking here, you'll need to pull the engine to fix it. If it's just pushrod tubes, you can fix that without pulling the engine. Either way, keep oil in that thar bus.

Welcome to the list! Joe
