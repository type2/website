&gt; I just checked my gas mileage in my 71 bus, for the third time since the end
&gt; of October and have noticed that my gas mileage aint what it should be. I
&gt; normally get somewhere between 19 to 23 mpg, now its about 12 to 15 mpg.
&gt;
&gt; I have check timing, points, carb, plugs, checked for vacuum and fuel leaks.
&gt; Everything seems OK.  I have heard older cars dont like this extra oxygenated
&gt; fuel we use during cold weather in Maryland.

not just you, my 78 is getting really bad mileage recently and I can't
find anything different.  I'm also in Maryland.  I'm down to 14mpg on my
last fill up (today)

&gt;  Is this true?  Can I do anything about it?
&gt; Or should I check something else.

don't really know
