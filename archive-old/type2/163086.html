Subject: Re: [T2] [Q] Dead Engine; Need Options

David,
Having driven two 71 campers, one with a rebuild engine (original case
and crank) and one with a Meximotor, I would suggest the meximotor.
The &quot;meximotor&quot; is a new VW 1600cc type 1 engine (longblock) that has
received some of the later improvements and has been used in bugs and
busses sold in south America until recently.

Nowadays and depending on labor cost where you live, rebuilding
yourself is not necessarily cheaper than paying someone to do it or
buying new stuff -- especially since you have not much to rebuild
since your case is shot.  Of course if you write your hours then,
buying a rebuild is the way to go. Stupid stuff like rebuilding rods
cost me a fortune even though I did it at the shop.

Meximotors seem to be getting 20+ mpg out of the box. The meximotor I
had was well worn , yet it did not leak oil, gave those 20+mpg and had
OK power.

The rebuilt original case+crank combo never wants to give over 20mpg,
even with a CDI and constant tuning. The case is at 60 thousand over
-- rebuild three times.

Definitely pull your engine yourself and undress/redress the engine
yourself, it will save you a ton of money, is easy to do and you'll
like doing it.

I do believe in balancing much less than many folks on that list, yet
I would recommend having  the flywheel and pressure plate balanced if
it isn't done yet.

Do not even *think* about a type 4 in that bus. If you want a bus with
a type 4 engine, sell your bus and buy a 73 or later bus. A hacked 71
is worthless IMHO.

Someone on the list should be able to help you locate a meximotor.

Now if you want performance type 1 engine, you ought to talk to
someone else for the mechanical advice
cheers
- Arnaud
