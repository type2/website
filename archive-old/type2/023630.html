Subject: what are all these knobs?

Hi All!

OK. Now onto the next thing. Now that my bus is painted, I've been working on 
regrounding the lights and installing new bulbs in the lights on my dash, 
since things don't seem to light up. 
A few quick questions, I'm sure have been answered before. I just read the 
post about what the knob is under the drivers seat (I've got a 71) but what 
are these?
* The knob directly to the right of the steering column on the dash (also 
looks like a light knob).
* The last knob on the dash to the right is a green knob with a swirly 
painted on it. This knob lights up. I imagine its a heater or something?

Next; the battery light on my dash never lights up, but I can seem to get the 
little sucker apart to check the bulb. Any thoughts?

None of my check lights light up on my dash (the generator lights) or the 
turn signal lights). I've checked all fuses, and all seem to be in working 
order. If I need to pull the speedo unit out, how do I work it around the 
vent knobs, and then what do I look for? (By the way the speedo itself and 
the fuel gauge will light up.)

All thoughts, as usual are appreciated. I could sleep last night getting 
excited about taking it camping!!!
