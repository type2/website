Help out my friend! He has to get rid of this nice bus before he moves out 
of where he is living.
He will scrap it too. I dont want to see this happen.
Here's the lowdown...
Light yellow, blue plaid interior(very good condition), stove, sink, fold 
out bed, poptop, center trash box, tables.
Good tires. Only rust is on the driver's side rocker(needs replaced)and step 
area. Transmission and axle beam are good as is all the glass. Motor was 
rebuilt with around 30k miles on it but blew a main seal about a year ago 
and hasnt been driven since. Heater boxes are good but definitely needs a 
muffler. No rust around the windows. Good brakes.
Easy summer project or you have the option of me doing all the work for 
you(I'm a VW mechanic). Please call me if your interested, 301 622 0311.

      Peace, Sam
