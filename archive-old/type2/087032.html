&gt; &gt; Yes!!  I've always wondered how some people can claim they removed/
&gt; &gt; installed their type4 engine with the tranny in place and fan housing
&gt; &gt; attached.  I've NEVER been able to do that.  Back before I started
&gt; 
&gt; Drat!  went to bed too early and missed the excitement.  Back before I
&gt; stopped pulling the engine alone, I had this problem as well.  I *did* get
&gt; the engine alone out a couple times, but:

well one of the nice things about an automatic.  it doesn't have to come
anywhere near as far back, just enough to clear the tranny studs so I have
only once pulled the tranny and decided it wasn't worth the extra hassle,
besides I think the auto tranny must weigh at least 10X as much as a
manual tranny.

&gt; the rear tin had to come off,

yeah had to do that

&gt; the oil had to come out,
&gt; the oil fill pipe had to come off the block, and

nope only had to remove the coil and the upper part of the oil fill, just
stuck something in the end to keep the dirt out, usually a rubber glove

&gt; the engine had to be tilted a bit.
&gt; It is an extremely tight fit in there to get the engine off the input

well automatic doesn't have an input shaft like the manual. the torque
converter shaft is maybe 2 inches long, the studs are longer

all is not goodness and light, the auto tranny has those 3 torque
converter bolts that make up for it.
