3 other stores with the same response. So if any one can help here are the

        R9677
        1482

This is how the numbers appear on the little metal tag.

Chip,

Call your local American Iron speed shop.  They probably have a crrent copy
of &quot;Holley Carburetion, Illustrated Parts &amp; Spec's Manual No.36-51&quot;  My
copy is Rev.1 copyright 1973.  It only goes up to R-6830-1, so I can't tell
you what your carb is off of.  My best guess would be a Holley-Weber 5200.
Commonly used on Ford 2 ltr and 2.3 ltr four cylinders. (Pintos and the
like)  Fairly common conversion for a lot of other 4 cyl engines.  I've
seen them on VWs, MGs, Jeeps and about any other 4 cyl car that you can
think of.  Was made by Holley to Weber design and patents.  Not a bad carb
for an American manufacturer.  Very similiar to the Weber DGAF and DGAV.  I
believe that the jetting is interchangable with the Weber carbs.  If you
can't find the book locally, you might give Holley a call.  The address
that I have for them is:

Colt Industries
Holley Carburetor Division
11955 East Nine Mile Road
Warren MI 48090

Good Luck!!

PS:  It is NOT a Bug Spray.  Completely different carb.  Bug Spray was a
modified 2110 series carb and from the period during which it was
manufactured, I would guess that the &quot;R&quot; number would be 3xxx.  (R-2999 is
for a '65 Dodge truck and R-4504 is for a '69 REO truck.)
