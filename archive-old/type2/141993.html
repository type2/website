Subject: crankshaft--removing dist. drive gear

I haven't done this for maybe 35 years now, so what I say may not be entirely 
correct, but in the interest of trying to be helpful, here goes.....

IIRC the timing gear is brass/bronze; its dimensions plus other stuff nearby 
make the typical gear puller inapplicable.  I had access to a lathe at the 
time, and fabricated a 'collar' from a wasted aluminum camshaft gear.  This 
drops over the crank gear; one inserts a couple of pieces (like half large flat 
washers) that engage behind the teeth of the crank gear.  Then one can safely 
use the typical puller or hyd. press.  Also IIRC it is important to heat the 
crank+gear in an oil bath before pulling.  Maybe I can find an image to send.

Have you looked at the possibility of buying a large gear puller from Horrible 
Freight?  This might work (I just didn't have one at the time); could be an 
easy/cheap choice since they often put them on promotion.  What I am talking 
about looks like a square of steel plate, cut in half, machined in a lathe to 
take out some of the center, and then held together with two bolts.  If you are 
interested I will find an item# for you.

Anyone have any tips on how to
press the gear off?  Type I engine.

I have a press, but I don't see
how I am going to hold the gear
while I press the crank through it
(without cutting some steel for
a jig)
