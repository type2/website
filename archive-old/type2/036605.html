Subject: 73 bus fs atlanta area

hey listees,

recently encountered someone on line selling their vw
bus and the info is listed below:  not real sure of
the price but im pretty sure it is in the hundreds of
$ range, well under $1000 probably, ive seen a couple
pictures of this bus, its orange and white, westy side
windows, clean nose, doglegs, very little rust
elsewhere.   email the individual below for any more
info.

1973 orange Volkswagen Bus. Full bed with storage
underneath in back (no back seats) with plenty of room
between bed and front seats. Great stereo system.
Needs TLC. I bought from man moving back to Germany
and planned to really fix it up but... Has some rust,
minor bend in back bumper, no dents in body. I have
not driven this bus in two years but spent over
$1,000.00 on it the last time I drove out of state.
Used to do flea markets. Not automatic. It is hard to
find someone in my area who will work on VWs and when
I have found someone, progress has been slow. I've
been told it needs gas tank cleaned out (rust
particles) and it also needs to have a new lock/key.
Get those fixed and it should drive fine. Selling
totally &quot;as is&quot;. I just want to get rid of as I'll be
moving next year. Have receipts for following work
prior to driving last: new tires, front brake
calipers, front brake pads, front grease seals and
brake rotors, intake boots, also put in new clutch and
fuel pump (no receipts). This is the greatest little
vehicle in world when running. I just no longer use.
You pick up. Please email me with qustions and I will
try and answer but am not a mechanic! Thanks.
