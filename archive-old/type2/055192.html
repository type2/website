&gt; We are leaving our of Charlotte, and are looking for caravan as well.
Anyone? Anyone? Buler? .... Also, since this will be our 1st ever &quot;bus event&quot;,
I have a few concerns.  Basically, our bus is up to the trip w/o a problem,
but not totally restored, and still needs a lot of work.  Are these types of
things just more for show, or is it a get together of fellow bus owners, no
matter what the condition of the bus?  I don't want to be the ugly duckling of
the crowd!  Thanks volks!  Have a wonderful day!

&gt; Hey-
&gt;
&gt; Sorry to bug the list with such a specific request. Think
&gt; of it as a pre-emptive AIRS post :^)
&gt;
&gt; I am looking for caravan mates leaving from the Durham,
&gt; NC area on Saturday morning. Anyone?
&gt;
&gt; thanks...
