Hey~!
Ignore my previous post. I'm going with the added &quot;guru&quot; security option.
With the wing vent latches in backwards I now have the added security update
of the latch handle crossing the stationery vertical bar that is adjacent to
the rear most edge of the vent glass. As long as I don't scratch the paint
I'm done.
Either that or I'm looking at redoing all of the monkee wrestling on another
Saturday. To heck with it. After all I call the thing the &quot;rat&quot; bus. =)

I'm over it. Vintage anal Nazis and folks assembling a raffle bus see the
previous post.

BTW: Any references to me as a &quot;guru&quot; in my posts is strictly tounge in
cheek humor. My Father taught me that we learn by our mistakes. We all are
constantly learning. Boy, did I learn a lot on Saturday. ;-)
