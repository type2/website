&gt;Question #2 - Fuse #2 (counting from the left) has blown twice in the

I am having a similar problem with fuse #8.  I have blown 2 of them
even with everything turned off. I popped in a new one and that
one blew immediately.
There is a fan mounted to the dash and it
was on when the first one blew (I was driving at the time).  
My question is how do you trace
down the problem?  Do you unplug everything or should you be able
to shut off the lights, fans, etc. and then turn each one on until you
find the problem?  

Maybe this will help Mike, too.

Thanks.
