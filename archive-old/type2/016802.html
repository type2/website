Subject: '63 Double Cab for Sale

My neighbor has decided to put his '63 double cab up for sale. As he is
not a listmember, I am posting this for the few that have been looking
for crews recently.

Steve is at  mailto:busrow_at_aol_dot_com
               562-429-9518
               Lakewood CA

He lists it as: dbl_dot_cab resto that is not finished. Painted red &amp; white
have all parts &amp; new int &amp; engine. New tires &amp; lots of other parts.

Price $5,800

It is a driver, the engine is in and working just fine.  The body work
is 100% done and paint was in the process of being laid down.  The top
is white and bottom is red (Like rosie the rocket sled).  I think the
gates are left to be painted.  He just had the seats redone in a very
nice gray tweed.
