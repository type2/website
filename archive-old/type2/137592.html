Subject: Re: [T2] Difference between 1971 vs. 1968 Engines

I bought a bolt with an allen head.  It was a little tricky to tighten 
because the clutch cable (actually, the adjustment wing nut) was in the 
way, but it wasn't too difficult to screw in.  Now I just need to add an 
8mm allen key to the engine removal toolkit.

I guess the washers could have worked, but the allen head bolt was pretty 
simple and straight forward.

&gt;Karl has a very good point with the suggestion of an allen bolt to solve the
&gt;problem,,, another way around the problem is to use a larger nut under the 
&gt;head
&gt;of the new bolt to lift the bolt away from the notch in the transmission. you
&gt;need a bolt long enough to compensate for the added nut under the head. or 
&gt;a few
&gt;washers....
