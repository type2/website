Subject: RE: [T2] Windshield - hammer - teardrops!

&gt; Maybe Andy should have used a hammer against a smallish piece of plywood
&gt; wrapped in a towel. to tap his windshield without pushing so hard as to
&gt; break it.  Using a hammer gives you the advantage of applying LESS overall
&gt; force, because you also have the advantage of velocity.  But of course, not
&gt; hammer on glass.  You have to whack something soft against the glass or
&gt; rubber.
&gt; 
Maybe a big rock or freeze block or even a curbstone whould have been
softer than my palms by this reasoning.
