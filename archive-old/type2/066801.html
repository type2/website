concerning welding and various travails on MIG, FCAW, MOUSE, etc

Advice: Practice, practice, practice and then when you think you are 
ready, dummy up what you intend to weld and practice some more. 
Especially practice in the position (vertical, overhead, flat, etc) 
the 'real' weld will be in.  Weld puddles don't want to behave.
