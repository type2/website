Subject: 6 Months in Casper

Hello List,
Mary Beth and I arrived back home today after right at 6 months and 21,000 
miles in Casper.
Got as far North as Fairbanks, where we decided the trek to the Arctic 
Circle was not in our best interests for use of time and experiences to be 
had, so Fairbanks became our Northernmost trip point; besides the free 
showers at U of AF would not be available if we went  farther North. :-)

Average overall trip MPG for Casper was 22.96 and that is an overall for 
mountains, desert, cold, heat, etc.
Casper ran great with no down times except for a few very minor thingies 
that needed fixin' as we went along.

LOTS of stories for later, as well as pictures.

What an experience.
WOW !!!
More Later,


Bob Perring
