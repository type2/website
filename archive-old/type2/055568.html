Subject: Re: Excessive Valve Noise

&gt; 
&gt; According to the Bentley I have, you only set the exhaust valves to .008
&gt; on 1974 1800 engines and/or when the exhaust valves are sodium filled.
&gt; 
&gt; Right under this note it says 1976 VWoA.  On the later Bentley's, what
&gt; does it say?
&gt; 
&gt; I've got my '77's valves all set at .006.  Should I reset the exhaust to
&gt; .008?
&gt; 
Paul,
I think you will be safe with .006&quot; but if you want to be extra safe, go
with .008&quot; for the exhaust valves.  They will be noisier but they will
cool better.  That's the whole rationale for the .008&quot; exhaust valve
setting.
