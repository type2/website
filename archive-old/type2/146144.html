&gt; I've been struggling with a problem for quit some time - my van will
&gt; seem to run fine but stall upon stopping at a light, stop sign, etc.
&gt; Occasionally, such as last Sunday, it quits completely, with no lights,
&gt; flashers, anything-totally dead.  No dash warning lights come on (either
&gt; before or after it quits).  When everything quits I can't start it
&gt; without a jump, but then it starts immediately.  My stepson thinks the
&gt; cause is an electrical short.  Last year, before he passed away, my dad
&gt; put in a new alternator.  I've checked the archives but haven't found an
&gt; exact match for this problem.  Any ideas?

Hey Donna   You need to start with the battery connections and the hot wire 
going from the alt. to the starter. Also check all the ground connections 
including the one at the front of the tranny  later  mark Dearing
