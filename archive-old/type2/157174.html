&gt; My friend wants me to help him wire up some trailer lights on his 70 double

&gt; the trailer has the normal 4 wire plug , 3 hot wires  - running lights  ,
&gt; left brake/turm . right brake/turn and a ground
&gt;
&gt; whats the cheapest way to set this up ?

Seems that it would be easiest to tee into the connectors at the
taillights themselves.  Just put a male and female spade connector on the
end of each wire and tie them in at the backside of the light.  Add a lug
for ground and you're in business.  It it's temporary you could probably
just run the wires out of the engine bay door with some tape to protect
the wires from chafing on the door.
