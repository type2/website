Subject: Re: CV joints stuff

Re flipping CV joints- I've done this, but flip the whole cv end, not the
whole axle.  (Or exchange both axles if both are out).  I dissassemble the
whole joint ONE AT A TIME and clean it; it really goes together only one
way.  As to direction of rotation, remember that the power comes from the
engine to trans to axle- put the joint on your finger and hold the outer
ring as you torque the finger in one direction or the other- you can see
where most of the force has to be against inner hub and outer ring.
install it so the torque is opposite what it used to be.  I USUALLY SCRATCH
POSITION OR ROTATION OF JOINT ON THE OUTER RING BEFORE I REMOVE THE AXLE!
