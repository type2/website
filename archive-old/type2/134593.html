Subject: RE: [T2] Arrgh, I just want to get back on the road.

No idea with carbs, but my 76 FI federal did this 10 years ago, where when I
got to a certain speed it would start bucking like crazy and it turned out
to be a flaky wiring harness.  Had to manually rebuild wire by wire since at
that time the only replacement wiring harness that I could find was holed up
somewhere in Austria and they wanted my first born in order to ship it to
the states.
