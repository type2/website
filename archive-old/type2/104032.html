Subject: RE: [T2] remanufactured half axles reliability??

&gt;I have had mine on from Autozone for about a yr and have had no probs. I say
&gt;go for it !



&gt;Well, I am finding that it will cost me more to replace boots etc. on
&gt;my current that to pay for replacements. Any body have experience with
&gt;auto zone or other remanufactured half axles????? Do they last? TIA!

Well I've had my Autozone axles for about two years now with not a single 
problem. Of course they are still in the attic awaiting installation....
