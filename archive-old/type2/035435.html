Subject: Insulating Overhead

Nick: Prior to spraying foam in the overhead, consider using the &quot;Reflextech&quot; 
or its competing product sold at many builders supply houses. It's a double 
layer of bubble wrap clad on both outer surfaces with an aluminum mylar. 
Available in several widths and is attached and butt sealed with alum tape. I 
used it in overhead of my Campmobile as well as walls, doors etc. Greatly 
enhances heat retention in winter and I was amazed at how warm the interior di
d not get after basking in the summer sun all day. Ray, 68 Campmobile, 69
