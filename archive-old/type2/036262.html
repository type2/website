Subject: heater control knob in 71 westy

I've tried to trace the location, and or function of the pull knob behind my 
right calf under the driver'seat.  It seeems to lead to a heat junction under 
the seat, but what part of the heat does it control?  I think it's frozen 
anyway - moves about an inch when I pull it.  I get good heat from the 
defrosters, and the vents in the kick panels regardless of what position it 
is in.  I've seen vents behind the seats in other busses, but mine doesn't 
have/need them there.  Rediculously stupid question #2.  Is it ok to ground 
more than one thing at a single bolt on the chassis?

thanks - Don
