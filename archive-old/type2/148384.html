Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Fair price vs. good price

No, this is like saying one person's apple is another person's orange. 
&quot;Fair price&quot; and &quot;good price&quot; are two different things. Let's get clear 
on that, okay?

What's the difference? A fair price is one that benefits both the 
seller (by allowing for a profit or for just compensation for labor) 
and the buyer (by being affordable and comparable to prices for similar 
goods and services). A good price is a judgment made by the buyer 
alone. A good price might be the same monetary value as the fair price, 
but that still doesn't make it possible for one person's good price to 
be another person's fair price.

In the case of the &quot;good price&quot; of $15 on the Samba, the price is a 
consequence of the fact that the seller has little or nothing invested 
in the panel; it is, in fact, a liability (like a lot of the crap I've 
collected over the years). The fair price for such an item really ought 
to be that the seller pays the buyer to get it out of his garage, or 
-$15.
