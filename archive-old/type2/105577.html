&lt;&lt; How do I identify areas where filler has been used (incorrectly)?  I 
know it has legitimate uses, I'm talking about big gaping voids in 
quarter panels, rocker panels, and noses that have been filled.

Thanks in advance for all replies.

Try a magnet...Test it on a known metal surface (door skin) to get the
feel of the attraction. Also check out the back of the questionable area.
Another test is the knuckle rap, metal has a distinctive ring, bondo has
that dead thunk...
