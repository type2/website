In 1973, we had a similar &quot;problem&quot; w/ our 63 Split Window. Round 4: 
Threw a softball sized rock thru passenger windshield; extracted keys. $12 
for a replacement winshield at the wrecking yard.

&gt; A tale of the formidable opponent that the bus is against a well 
&gt; equipped lockmithing foe.
&gt; A friend locked her keys inside her '78 VW Westi.
&gt; I stayed around to watch the show.
&gt;   
&gt; Round 1 - 
&gt; A locksmith came out and in the first round attempted 
&gt; to gain entrance through a wing window using a special tool that 
&gt; looked like an ice pick that had been run through blender.  It had 
&gt; lots of bends and angles that allowed it to be fed between the glass 
&gt; and rubber to engage the catch on the wing handle and then rotate the 
&gt; handle to open the wing.  Tool broke.
&gt; Score after the first round.  VW 1 : Locksmith 0
&gt; Round 2 -
&gt; Locksmith proceeded to try again with a another similar tool. See 
&gt; round one for the action.
&gt; Score after the second round.  VW 2 : Locksmith 0
&gt; Round 3 -
&gt; Locksmith proceeded to attempt to pick lock on driver's door.  After 
&gt; about 15 minutes of valiant effort, the locksmith finally gave up and 
&gt; asked what window he could break.
&gt; Score after the third round.  VW 3 : Locksmith 0
&gt; Round 4 -
&gt; I told him that all of the locks on the bus have considerable 
&gt; resistance to turning, except the rear hatch. We went to the aft end 
&gt; and proceeded to attempt the entry.  Considerably exhausted, or was 
&gt; that disgusted, he tried in vain to pick the lock.  With assistance 
&gt; from the author (doing the rotate thing) while he did the raking 
&gt; thing we finally managed to unlock the hatch.
&gt; Final score.  VW 3: Locksmith 1
&gt; 
&gt; Lessons learned:
&gt; 1 - Keep a hide-a-key somewhere.
&gt; 2 - If you MUST have  locksmith pick their way into a bus, go 
&gt; straight to the end of the line, or aft of the bus anyway.
