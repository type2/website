Got them yesterday.  To recap I had bought heads from Mark Stephens last
year and discovered that one of the exhaust valve guide bosses was broken off.

I had to pay shipping both ways but I now have a much nicer set of heads.
No cracks are immediately visible (though I haven't removed the valves yet)
and the combustion chambers are nicely polished (I paid for
unshrouding/polishing).  They even managed to find me another set of heads
with the vent ports under the valve covers, which was nice of them.  The
only things I noticed were that the chambers are marked 48cc's when I
specified 47 (no big deal - a little lower compression won't hurt) and they
didn't drill and tap the CHT sensor mount on the right head like I asked
(again, no big deal I can do that myself).

The heads will go on sometime in the next month, then I will get some
bigger main jets and go back to the dyno to see how much (if any)
horsepower I gained for my $450 MSHP investment.
