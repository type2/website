&gt; Hey all---spent all day on Erin's bus, still no success.
&gt; Once again, the discussion is also going on thesamba here:
&gt; http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/forum/viewtopic.php?p=819099#819099

The ongoing saga---

So we were once again unable to get the bus running.  In some ways
things have gone to worse, we're not able to get the bus to turn over
now since Erin pulled the distributor to get the part number.  I'm down
the block from a VW mechanic's shop, and he's come by a couple times to
help us out, but by Friday afternoon he had to acknowledge that he's
stumped.  The bus will fire on the cold start injector, but stops stops
immediately afterwards, and we just don't know why.  I gave him a bottle
of wine for his troubles.  :)

Anyway, we decided to just take a break yesterday, because we weren't
getting anywhere and we were starting down the dangerous rathole of just
pulling &amp; replacing parts---Maybe it's the fuel pump!  Maybe it's the
weird (non-pertronics) electronic ignition!  Maybe the windshield wiper
fluid is low!  My mechanic said that we'll just tow it up to the shop on
Monday and hook it up to their test machines and get down to it once and
for all.  So in the meantime Erin went exploring Seattle and I went
sailing.  Today she went off busking to try to raise money for repairs,
and later she's going to very methodically check the electrical
connections, to see if she can locate any bad connections or leaks to
ground.

It's definitely been an interesting introduction to AIRS for me.  :)
Hopefully, with a qualified mechanic and all the right test gear she'll
be on the road to SF early next week.  I've learned a lot about bus
engines over the last few days, and more than a few canadian swear
words...
