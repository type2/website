&amp;gt; I know your objective is simply to replace the boots, but you might as well
&amp;gt; treat this a CVJ renewal. Since you mentioned replacing the grease, you might
&amp;gt; already be thinking along this line. In any event, clean out all the old grease
&amp;gt; from your CVJs. You'll need to take them off the shaft to do a good job of
&amp;gt; this. Make everything shine. Inspect for any galling on the balls or the race.
&amp;gt; Replace if needed (and if you replace one CVJ, replace both of them).

I mildly disagree with a lot of this.  Back when I didn't have a lot of
money I reinstalled a somewhat pitted CV joint that I couldn't afford to
replace.  It never started to make noise so I decided to treat it as an
experiment and keep running it.  It went nearly 100K before I finally
replaced it and it still wasn't making noise!

Since then, I just make sure that I'm equipped to replace a CV on the
road, but never replace them for minor pitting.  I think that a lot of
money is spent replacing CVs that still have a lot of miles left on them.

The other issue, replacing both CVs at the same time, seems to be more one
of convenience than of prudence.  I've never seen two CVs go one right
after another.  There's no &amp;quot;balance&amp;quot; issue as with brakes so there is no
reason to replace a perfectly good joint simply because its axlemate is
being replaced.

If you do decide to replace both, the best route is just to buy an entire
rebuilt axle and avoid the mess!
