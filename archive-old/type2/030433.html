OK, the overwhelming opinions are 

Q1: do you have the stock trans?

A:  Yes.  John Anderson (who is visiting) brought this up this evening and
we scraped the plate clean.  It is a DK trans manufactured in '80.  The
original.

Q2: Do you have a tach hooked up?

A: No.  Since this is a CA '80, and all stock, and there are warnings all
over the place about hooking anything to the electronic ignition, I have
resisted the temptation :-)  OTOH, I may well go looking for an
electronic-ignition-capable (possibly with an inductive pickup?) tach.
Any opinions on tachs for electronic ignition?

Q3:  Do you think it may just be overreaction to the noise?

A: Yes.  It may well be. :-)  As some said, it is a new engine, it is a
modified engine, and I am a bit terrified of it :-)  Possibly the
solution is to put the cushion and a couple sleeping bags on it and drive
like usual.  Just being paranoid, I guess.... but I'm looking for a tach
and it don't move another inch 'til I am happy :-)

Right at the moment, my head is splitting and my stomach is churning at
the prospect that this engine will not work out (and you thought this only
happened to newbies :-), but I am also sure, from long experience that
this will pass as I develop confidence in the car :-)
