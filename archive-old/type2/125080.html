Subject: RE: [T2] Type 1 engine oil pump removal

You can pry with two screwdrivers, it ain't easy, and if a hardcore
drying permatex is used, it can be almost impossible. I have one that
BROKE the puller, and I have to solvent melt the sealant. Any engine
done right, you should be able to shimmy it out. If you pry, pump will
likely be killed by gouges.
Good luck,
Al

A friend had a knock in his engine right behind the big pulley on an
upright engine.  Last hope is a loose cam something or other (I forgot)
anyway he needs to remove the oil pump and we don't have a puller. Any
idea where to locate one or a way around it???

Thanks in advance,
Snoopy
