Subject: Newbie with 1972 Westie

Good Day,

Newbie here with a 1972 Westie, with an upgraded 1978 2000cc motor. 

Does anyone know how to secure the distributor down? I got the motor from a wreck yard (it  runs beautiful) and have never worked on a VW air cooled motor (Yes, I'm a REAL newbie).  Right now the distributor is just &quot;sitting&quot; there.  Seems dangerous so I haven't driven the unit yet.

Please help,

Thanks in advance,

Nick
1972 VW Westfalia
