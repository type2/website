Subject: re: clutch problems

hey now,

it COULD be the cluth plate or flywheel or it also could be that your clutch
cable is too loose. you should have about 1/2&quot; to 3/4&quot; play in the pedal. too
much or too little and you COULD get the symptons. OR...and i think this is
what is wrong with my '74, you may want to check the way the cable goes to the
back. on mine, some FPO fixed the medal tubing with a clear plastic hose. it's
my understanding that this may cause the cable some weird motion problems. i'm
going to fix it and then see. otherwise you are going to have to drop the
engine and check the flywheel and plate. at least ya do in a '74.

as usual, insert disclaimer here.....---&gt;   &lt;---
