Subject: Re: [T2] Bay Window Westy interior into a split window?

&gt; I have someone who lives nearby interested in taking
&gt; the interior of my

&gt; know if the westy cabinets and seats will fit into
&gt; his '63 Panel.&lt;&lt;

I did this once and found that the side cabinet and
rear seat in the splits are about 3-4 inches than in
the bays.  It can be done easily enough, but its not a
straight-forward bolt-in.
