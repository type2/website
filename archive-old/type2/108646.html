Subject: Fw: [BP] Bus no start

Hello all

On the 2 hour plus ride home I had no problems at all. Stopped a couple of times for a drink or
washroom break. Bus started no problem. Once back at home I stopped to visit my brother. I was there
maybe 1 hour. When I tried to start the bus NOTHING. Dead. No engine or oil light or the fuel gauge
action. I went to the back of the bus to look for a loose wire or something but all seemed intact. The
coil was quite warm though. After an hour of sitting. Does this sound like a bad coil? I have lots of
power at the battery, as I can turn over the starter with my hot wire in the engine compartment. I have
interior lights and such. Anything that needs the igniton on will not work.  Would appreciate any ideas
