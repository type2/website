Subject: Re: [T2] locking gas cap?

In a message dated 8/13/03 10:44:33 PM, tuinstrad_at_comcast_dot_net writes:

&lt;&lt; I have a 78 with a locking gas cap.  My daughter lost the one on the bus
during a recent trip.  So I went down the local flaps and bought a nice new
one.  BUT I can not figure out how it works.  I put it on and it doesn't lock
or stay on the vehicle.

The inner cylinder turns but the two pegged middle cylinder doesn't.  Looks
like it must turn to me somehow?  Can anyone explain how it works?  Sorry to
be so stupid that a gas cap outsmarts me!!

thanks!
 &gt;&gt;

FWIW, the local gas jockey lost my original cap ('79), and I just measured the
flange and matched it to a generic cap from R&amp;S Strauss...
