&gt;- One of the keepers an inch down in the pushrod tube

Probably was not seated properly when the head was assembled.  It's
possible to install them so that they look okay at a casual glance but are
not completely seated.

&gt;- Both pushrods have a 3/8&quot; ring of wear one inch from the rocker end

That's where the retaining wire was loose and rubbed the pushrods.

&gt;So how could this happen? I adjusted the valves before starting the first 
&gt;time, and again after 25 miles or so. The keepers must have been on then. 
&gt;I didn't find the other keeper (though it may be down in the case). Is it 
&gt;remotely possible that the keeper disintegrated in place.
&gt;
&gt;Too weird, but otherwise it's really good news (I think)!

Yes, reassemble with a few replacement parts and you should be back on the
road in no time!
