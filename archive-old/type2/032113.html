Hi, everybody: 

[1] On Friday 20 nov 98, Thom Fitzpatrick &lt;thom_at_calweb_dot_com&gt; opined:

&gt; If we were 1/2 as organized as the NRA, we'd have autobahns
&gt; with a 125MPH speed *minumum*

&gt; If we were 1/10 as organized as the religious organizations,
&gt; we'd be able to get tax breaks for turbochargers.      

Never much cared for Newt Gingrich, but he made an astute obvervation
[&quot;astute&quot; = &quot;I agree&quot; + &quot;I'm not actually prepared to admit that he
thought of it before I did&quot;].  While zipping along the Autobahn at
comfortably high speeds, he realized a difference between Americans and
Germans: 

If the German government lowered the speed on the Autobahn to 55mpn [or
its kph equivalent], everyone would drive 55mph until the next election,
at which time they'd vote those representatives out, vote in some that
would raise the limit again, and then go back to driving like bats out of
hell. 

By comparison, in the USA, everyone would complain bitterly, continue to
drive 80mph anyway, and re-elect 90% of the same representatives back into
office. 

[2] I was a type2 subscriber for the first year I had my completely
trashed out 1970 bus--it had most of the engine in the back seat, a lot of
the wiring cut, and it was covered with moss.  List members may remember
nursemaiding me through my first brake job, in the rain, a couple of years
ago this Thanksgiving weekend.  Or not. Then my internet access became too
unreliable to stay subscribed, so I was away for a couple of years.  I
Resubscribed this month, Browsed the archives, found many things
interestingly different, many things comfortably unchanged. [You guys are 
still arguing about tires.  I can't TELL you how gratifying that was to 
discover.]

I had to drop my subscription on short notice 'way back when, and didn't
get to thank everyone on the list properly for their patience, humor,
advice, and lore.  All were most welcome and appreciated.  In the interim,
the bus and I are doing a lot better, my stupid questions are of a
noticeably higher calibre now, and I no longer even think to worry about
driving the bus only as far as I'm willing to walk back.  Nice to see
everyone again. 

Someone once asked me what it was like, talking with you folks on the
list, and I said it was like crashing a party and finding out you'd been
invited the whole time anyway. 

[3] I have a nomenclature/insurance question: My insurance company insists
on calling my 1970 a &quot;vanagon.&quot;  I doublechecked at vanagon_dot_com:  that
designation is off by about ten years, isn't it?  What I want to know is:
Why do they insist on this even though I've pointed out the error? [Yeah,
because the computers do their thinking, but someone had to put that
miscategorization in there to begin with--why?] And more to the point, if
I had to file a claim tomorrow, is this some kind of loophole that could
cost me money?  In fact, is it costing me money now? Didn't see this topic
in the archives, but if it's a dead horse, someone can just drop me a
private note and I'd be grateful. 

best regards,
Bill
