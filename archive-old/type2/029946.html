&gt; The commercial mentioned is over a year old. The &quot;sports car&quot; isn't - it is
&gt; really a fuel-efficient gasoline electric hybrid vehicle  - the Honda Insight.
&gt; The original ad featured their introductory model year color which was a
&gt; shockingly bright, acidic, yellow-green; the current ad uses a model with a
&gt; metallic silver color. Last December, my wife and I purchased an Insight and
&gt; love it. No hype - on the highway, the car achieves &gt; 70 mpg and 50-60 in city
&gt; driving.

It's interesting to compare the insight and the bus in terms of economics.
You can get the insight for about $20K or a nice bus for about $5K  The
price premium is about $15K for the Insight.  At $2 a gallon, that 15K
will buy you about 7500 gallons of gas.  At 20MPG, that gas will carry you
about 150,000 miles.  You can also take along a (literal) ton of stuff or
six of your closest friends, as opposed to one friend and an overnight
bag in the Insight.

My physics classes do a cost comparison between the Insight and the Civic.
With $2 a gallon gas, the economic break-even point is around 700,000
miles!  To get a breakeven point at 100,000 miles requires that gas cost
around $12/gallon, which would even cause our UK friends some heartburn! 

Hybrid cars are the future, but they still have a lot of refining to do.
the Honda and Toyota entries are conservative designs combining both
conventional and electric drivetrains and braking systems.  When the
drivetrains go pure electric, with the engines simply supplying
electricity to the batteries I thinks that hybrids will become much more
viable.  Perhaps VW could do that with the New Bus!  :)
