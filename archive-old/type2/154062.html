Subject: Re: [T2] braided Brake Booster Hose

I used 1/2 inch ID fuel hose.  Worked fine.  The stuff that I used didn't go
flat since it had a decent wall thickness.  The local farm supply place
sells the same hose for hydralic use as well but it looks like high pressure
big bore fuel line.  If you have a problem with the stuff that you get you
can put a 1/2 inch spring in it to keep it from colapsing.  This also works
for tight radius bends.  Don't forget the stretch attaching the metal tube
hose to the brake booster at the front end.  A leak there will make it
inpossible to get a stable idle.
