Subject: Thoughts on locking engine compartment

I always wanted to put a lock on there, but then I
decided that the time I forgot to unlock it before
driving would be the next fire. One fire was from a
wire that I had installed without circuit protection -
for what, I don't remember - but either it was too
light in gauge or the insulation softened from being
in contact with something hot - I don't remember. I do
remember that it was shorting out on the steel fuel
rail line and that the steel had definite burn pitting
in it. That scared me pretty bad and got me to pay
more attention to doing things right.

If the engine compartment had been locked, I would
have lost the bus.

For a time I had a locking pin that I had drilled a
hole somewhere for the pin to fit into and prevent the
door from opening. The pin was easily accessed if you
knew where to reach for it.

Eventually I decided that the only people who would
maybe want to steal anything from me would be other VW
bus folks and they're 99.99% honest folks, so I
haven't bothered since.

Maybe I lead a charmed life, though. My #3 car was my
Duster. I had forgotten to take the keys out of the
trunk when I had gotten something out of there. It was
about three months later that I noticed them hanging
there. I live in a predominately low-income housing
area and all the neighbor kids used to cut through my
driveway and back yard to access a trail... and the
keys were hanging there most of summer vacation. My
worst thieves are those who ask to borrow tools! -BaH
