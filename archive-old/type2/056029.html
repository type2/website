Subject: Re: 1962 Single Cab For Sale

	I have a 1962 light blue pick-up I have to part with. It has a
1600 engine and only has 53k original miles on it. This truck is in great
shape, almost no rust at all and the engine runs great. A canvas cover
protects the back. I do not have, nor can I e-mail pics on-line. I would
gladly send pics to anyone who is seriously interested. I am asking
$6,000 or best offer.
