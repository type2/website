Subject: Wooden Headliner Pics?

There's been alot of discussion about wooden headliners lately and my 
curiosity is piqued. Did these come standard in any busses or are they 
strictly an owner mod? Does anyone know of any website(s) with pics? Wooden 
door panels seem fairly straight forward but the headliner looks to be 
trickier...especially mounting. There's nothing like the feel of wood, 
though!

TIA
