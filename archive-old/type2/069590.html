Subject: ?: Steering Wheel Alignment

After new ball joints and alignment job my steering wheel is slightly
off.  In other words, when the bus goes straight the wheel is turned
about 10 degrees left.

It it easy enough fix this or should I just let it go?

The tires are wearing evenly, which is what I really care about but
still, it would be nice to correct this problem.
