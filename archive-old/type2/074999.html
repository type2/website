Subject: Re: [T2] Bumpers

That chrome bumper with the impact strip probably came from a Champagne Edition
bus. In 78 and 79 VW offered deluxe buses in either bus or Westy versions. They
were called Champagne Edition. The big giveaway about them was the brown
interior. Everything on the dash was brown: dash, steering wheel, turn signal
and wiper switch arms, rear view mirror, etc.

Most of the bumpers I see in the wrecking yards have done their job over the
years.... About all that I get from them are the impact strips.... I have lots
of fronts, the rears are chewed up.
I believe Rocky Mountain Motor Works offers new ones. Probably not as thick or
as good as the original... since they are from Brazil.

&gt; Hiyo
&gt;
&gt; The bumper on the back of my Bus is a bit bent, and I wonder if anyone has
&gt; had the opportunity to have a Bus bumper straightened.  It is a 76.
&gt;
&gt; This is a chrome bumper(at least it looks chrome) with a big thick black
&gt; rubstrip on it.  To tell you the truth, I don't think I've ever seen another
&gt; Bus with bumpers like this.  Is it worth trying to straighten?  Is there a
&gt; source for new &quot;chrome&quot; bumpers?
