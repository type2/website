Hey Volks!
First, I want to thank..... heh... all of you for helping me find the right
bus.  Three weeks ago, I drove a rental car from Mobile to Jacksonville (6.5
hrs per way) and drove back in my '72 Westfalia.  It's not perfect, just
perfect from me.  Of course, money was spent as soon as I got back: total
brake job, cv boots.  It's running great now, but I have yet more questions
than answers.
    First, the bus has no heat.  Normally it would be no problem here in the
sub-tropics, but gees!  It is missing the hanging blower in the engine
compartment (is that a standard item?) and I have no Idea if the cable
controls work.  I don't even know what they mean!!! The right red lever is
f'd-up and the left seems fine.  I also have no idea what the small knob
under your legs does.  Does anybody know where I can get a replacement vent
gasket/screen for the front?  Also, has anybody tried out a SCAT bus shifter
for late t-2's?  My Shifter is clumsy and is hard as hell to get out of the
reverse-mode.
  Thanks again, and by the way, after driving several campers, the type 4 FI
engines like mine are definitely better.
