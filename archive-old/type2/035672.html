Subject: help me install my engine!

yo, 
         as we speak,  my engine is waiting to be installed back from whence 
it came.  here's the problem. while the engine was out i gapped my valves, 
thus turning the flywheel. now my engine doesn't want to go home.  is this 
because i turned the flywheel? everything on the outside seems to be lined up 
correctly. it's a 1700 on a 72'. please advise.
    

         TIA
                N8
