Subject: RE: [T2] VW Parts - JC Whitney???

I know they do take things off their catalogs, but believe it or not, they
actually sell more than what's on their catalog. They can also special order
things. I used to have a 1982 Recaro TransAm LU5. I wanted a set of headers
and they sold a fairly decent pair (turned out to be FlowTECHS). They didn't
offer the Y-pipe however.. in their catalog. I called up the order number
and they ordered me the Y-pipe at their own discounted price.

&gt;             Quick question.... I haven't purchased a whole lot of parts
from
&gt; JC Whitney before, but what I have gotten, I've been pretty satisfied
with.
&gt; I understand that the JC Whitney catalog has a decent selection of
&gt; Volkswagen parts. How would you guys rate their parts, particularly
&gt; suspension pieces and whatnot. I plan on rebuilding the suspension in my
&gt; BUS. I also need the steering components (center-link) to my 81 Bandit,
just
&gt; curious what kind of quality they provide.

In the last couple of JC catalogs I got I noticed a serious reduction in
the VW parts they carry. Down to like 2 1/2 pages. Bus specific stuff
pretty much gone.
