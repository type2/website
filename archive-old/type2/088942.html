Subject: Re: [T2] sliding window parts???

[...]

&gt; Say it ain't so.  Seems that the parts I need are used
&gt; on vanagon sliding windows also.  We don't have many late model vanagons
&gt; around here, but I saw an 81 today in a car lot and it has the same
&gt; sliding windows as are on my 78.

They are the same in looks but NOT in size. Vanagon sliders are close to 3&quot;
TALLER than bay sliders.
