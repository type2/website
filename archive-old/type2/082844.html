Subject: RE: living in my bus

&gt;Take the jokes about how West Virginia got
settled seriously. Think about it... bus breaks
down, funds are low... Never park/live too far
away from people (in general) or a great source
for bus parts (imperative).

What?  What jokes about my Robert C. Byrd
Memorial State?

Peace and blessings,
