Subject: Re: FI diagnosis idea??
Message-ID: &lt;HMBACEFCFGACBAAA_at_hotbot_dot_com&gt;

&gt;Is there anything that could be learned from using a tach/dwell meter 
&gt;hooked across the injector plug?

Bill,

  You may be able to get some kind of rough diagnosis from using a dwell meter across the FI injector plug, but it would only be rough.  Fully-equipped repair places invest in digital diagnostic equipment (looks like engine analyzers) that show the pulse waveform.  A meter would only give an averaged indication (all the pulses hitting the meter faster than it can react to a single pulse).  Don't know if the meter would be any better than the inexpensive test light made for FI injectors.

  OTOH - if you want to experiment, you may want to look for an inexpensive oscilloscope (radio/tv repair places, on-line auctions, classified ads, etc.).  Hooking the o-scope leads to the FI plug will allow you to see the entire pulse (if the o-scope does not have internal syncronization, the picture may jump from side to side - minor problem) instead of an averaged value.
