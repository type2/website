Subject: Re: [T2] re: solar power fridge

Tom said:
&gt; Also, from what I've heard, the combination LP/AC/DC

&gt; fridges aren't 
&gt; very efficient in DC mode.  So again, if you're
&gt;going for DC only 
&gt;(solar, etc.), look for DC only fridges.

Combination LP and anything else refrigerators are
going to be absorption type refrigerators, and use
whatever electricity they use in electric mode to
repace the heat of the LP burner, so they are usually
very inefficient when run in the electric mode.
So, yes, use a refrigerator that runs only on 12 volts
DC for low power consumption in a bus.
