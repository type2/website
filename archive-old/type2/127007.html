Subject: F.I. to Weber carb conversion on a 2litre

I did this on an '80 Westy about 10 yrs ago. Couldn't
come up with the cash for a new computer(3 separete
mechanics, all VDub people said it was fried)I ripped
out all the wires, computer and FI stuff, bought a new
manifold and a decent size Weber. As I recall I had to
chop down the accelerator cable and put one of those
'HELP' parts from FLAPS on the end of it to attach it
to the carb and I modified the manifold with gentle
taps from a 5LB sledge hammer untill it cleared the
top engine hatch. Don't beleive there was much more to
it. It passed inspection in Oregon. Ran like a champ,
but the gas milage did suffer slightly.
