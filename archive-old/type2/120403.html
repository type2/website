Subject: Stuck Heater Cable

I'm working on my 79 Westy...

The heater cables (sheath and metal cable) are fed
through a tube going the length of the Bus.
The problem I'm having is getting the old cables out
of the tubes! They are just stuck. 

Has anybody out in Listville come up with a solution
to the stuck cable in the tube?? Perhaps there is a
acid solution that would soften up the plastic
covering allowing the cable to slide out?

Any help would be appreciated.
