&gt;I have never seen a 411 FI setup in real life but I would imagine it is a
&gt;similar design.  Since the 411 first got FI in 1971 I would bet it had an

&gt;then.  Did the Type 3's that got FI in 1967 use oil bath or paper element
&gt;air cleaners?  I don't know...

Sean &amp; Wade -

411 71-72 and 412 1973 only Sedans and Wagons used the D-Jetronic Fuel
Injection virtually identical to the Type 3 models using an Oil Bath Air
Cleaner with breather hose connecting into the side of the air cleaner
assembly.  But because D-Jet doesn't use an AFM, this didn't matter.

412s in 74 went to the AFC L-Jetronic FI like what's used on the Buses and
Vanagons, using a paper element cleaner and as Sean says, the breather hose
attaches to the intake AFTER the AFM.  Oil present within the AFM flapper
assembly indicates an excessive amount of crankcase blow-by, reinforced by
the occasional back fire thru the intake.  Not a usual thing, but I've seen
it happen (my Ex-80 Vanagon did for example).  Just general poor
maintenance over a long period can have a minor effect like this.

I just replaced the AFM on my 84 Wasser last year.  Even though I knew it
was pristine when I put the engine together in May 97, it had a slight oily
buildup in the flapper assembly and throat area.  Every oil change, I now
remove the intake elbow, clean the elbow (check it for cracks too), the
flapper (if necessary) and the throttle body flap (now that gets really
messy!).  Keep stuff clean I always say.  Don't overclean the AFM flapper
with carb cleaner spray, the flapper needs a little lubrication for moving
around.  I use a clean shop towel myself, just wiping the throat area,
that's usually enough.

Hope this helps. :)
