Subject: Biking at Mammoth

I spoke with Mammoth Mountain Ski Area today.  They will be open for biking
on the weekend we'll be there.  A full day's lift ticket costs $22.  This
includes unlimited gondola rides for you and your bike.  A ticket for one
ride to the top and trail access costs $12.

They also have full suspension bikes available for rent, at $35/day, and
less for hour and half-day rentals.  These bikes are available on a
first-come, first-serve basis.

Me and the boys will definitely be there biking.  The scenery should be
gorgeous.  Anyone want to make a picnic of it?
