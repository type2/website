Hi all,

On the way from St. Louis to texas i ran into another bus driver.  he was
driving a 71 westy (red, rust free but pretty darned beat up.  Missing
most of the drivers side rear corner) i was turning off of 44 to head
south and he was headed east.

This gentleman had been overseas with the military for some number of
years and had returned to california.  He then, as far as i recall, set
out for michigan in his bus.  Somewhere along the way the front brakes
failed.  I suggested it was hydraulic, but he insisted his calipers were
frozen and he would make it home using the parking brake.  I wished him
the best of luck and we parted ways, after i had stopped at teh diner and
had a plate of eggs ;)

I spent 5 days in fort worth with a friend, trying to meet up with another
listee with no success.  I feel bad being in town and not running into
him.  Perhaps next time eh.

one of the days i was suppsed to meet up with him i decided to drive to a
bug shop in Ft. Worth.  On the way there i was trying to roll up my
drivers side window and heard a clunk as the glass fell to the bottom of
the door.  When i got to the buggy shop they had a 54 panel van with an
okrasa sticker on the rear engine lid.  Bright yellow.  The key was even
in the ignition and i bet it would start right up.  They didnt have any
way to help me with my window, but suggested where i might look.

I got lost and ended up 40 miles the wrong way.  Oops, i have a tendency
to do that sometimes.  On the way to the salvage yard i stopped and took
apart my door to make sure what i needed was a regulator.  Turned out that
the piece that supports the glass had broken and what i really needed was
a welder.  So i put the door panels in the back and went to another bug
shop a bit back up the road.  they had a really interesting green 62 bus.
it had an aluminum poptop that looked like it popped straight up, hmm.
amyway he sent me to a welder that was just past the salvage yard i had
been looking for so off i went.

 When i got to the salvage yard they recommended there were a fair number
of busses, most rust free but picked completely clean or even with
significant sheetmetal chunks removed to fix other busses i suppose.
Being from Missouri, the land of rust it is wierd to see scrapyard busses
that dont have several huge cancerous holes in em somewhere.

One of the busses was a double door panel, 65 i think.  Not a single part
left on it save all 6 doors and a hatch. Unfortunately all that was left
was dented, bent and otherwise rendered unuseable.  for me going to
junkyards is a bit sad as every car i can get parts from is one less left
to drive, you know. 

finally i got to the welder, he fixed my part and i was back on the road
again with the ability to seal out the elements.

few days later i headed down to galveston, and here i am.  Seen 3 or 4
busses on the island, and a thing and a bug or two.  Its wierd being in a
city where you know no-one.  this is my first big road trip alone and im
not quite sure what to do with extra time.  Its easy when you have to be
somewhere with a timetable to keep to, but just sitting around in a new
place is unusual to say the least.

early tomorrow morning i will be heading out of texas and driving
along the gulf coast to louisiana, then on to florida via alabama...

if anyone has any suggestions, tips etc, i'd be glad to have em.

take care,

Steve
