I just purchased a 79 Bus with the fuel injection and catalytic conversion 
emissions set up. When I had my emissions done in California, my 
hydrocarbons were about 600 ppm at idle, but fine when revved up. My 
question is can I adjust the air flow meter to reduce the hydrocarbons at 
idle, and how would I do this?

Thanks

Bo Bowman
