Subject: Cooling Tin seal

Hi folks

I am trying to get my tin sealed completely. I have found all the seals except
for the gromet that seals the left hot air hose as it passes through the tin
to heat exchanger. Number 40 here http://tinyurl_dot_com/meug . Does anyone know
where I might be able to find this rubber gromet or have an idea of what to
use instead? I thought that this might work but I think it's to small
http://tinyurl_dot_com/mev6 .

Thanks
