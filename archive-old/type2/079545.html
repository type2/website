Good question, personally I would not adjust the lifters if all I did was 
tubes, unless I also replaced lifters and push rods. &quot;oil vice air&quot; means 
there is air in the lifters instead of oil. After the engine is started the 
lifters fill with oil as the air bleeds out of the lifters. &quot;Vice&quot; is a word 
used in place of &quot;in place of&quot; or instead. Sorry for the confusion with words.
