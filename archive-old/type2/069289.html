&gt;Hi all!
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone have a bus with the 2.0l engine (69PS)? Could you tell me, 
&gt;how much fuel you need?
&gt;
&gt;I actually need 20l/100km (14mpg) and I think, this is a lot too much 
&gt;One weeek ago on the highway I only needed 12l/100km (24mpg). I 
&gt;underdstand, that the consumption on short ways must be higher, but I 
&gt;think this is a lot too high.


I've cann't comment on a 2liter type 4 engine, but USA responders should 
note that 20 and 12 litres/100km equate to 11 and 19 mpg for US gallons
The conversion above is for Imperial gallons.

BTW
This must be the only thing in the USA that smaller than in the rest of 
the world:-)


I get about the same with my 1600 and I don't think it gets a lot better 
with a bigger engine.

NB the mpg figures
