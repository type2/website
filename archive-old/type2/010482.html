&gt; Steve Dolan gave a nice review of the different

&gt; Steve: My brake light AND generator idiot lights
&gt; come on when I pull the dash lever down to
&gt; activate my heater fan.
&gt; Does this sound like a crossed wire? or ground short?,
&gt; or do these lights together mean something else?
&gt; Anxious drivers need to know.
&gt; 
&gt; The heater fan on my '73 Westy (and everything else)
&gt; seems to be working fine, but I won't rest until I fix
&gt; it so that they don't come on like this.

I had a problem with my brake lights where the brake warning light
would come on whenever the brake light or the turn signal on the left
side was on.  Turns out that there was a bad ground between the light
housing and the body.  I added a dedicated ground wire and that cured
the problem.
