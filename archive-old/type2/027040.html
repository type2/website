When in 1988~89, I serviced the front brake caalipers of my British 
specification 1973 VW 1600 Type 2, I used a genuine ATE service kit from my 
local clutch and brake centre, but the kit DID NOT contain any replacement 
O-ring seals, which seal the hydraulic fluid galleries between the two 
caliper halves.

Fortunately, my existing O-rings were in excellent condition, so I reused 
them, but it might have been difficult to obtain some new ones. My local VW 
agent informed me that one is not supposed to split the calipers in half, 
when servicing them, but I don't know how else I would have removed all the 
accummulated sludge.

Make sure you have the necessary O-rings, before splitting the caliper 
apart. The bolts are very tight, so soak them with plenty of 
penetrating/releasing oil first and progressively apply torque to the bolts, 
to minimise the risk of shear.

Good luck.

&gt;The
&gt;boot kits will also come with 2 litle o-rings that are used to seal the
&gt;2 halves of the caliper together.
