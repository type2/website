&lt;&lt; Maybe I've just listened to the &quot;Stock is God&quot; lectures too long, but 
except

for some technological advances (pointless ignition, etc...) I throw my lot

in with the &quot;VW designed it that way for a reason&quot; theories.  YMMV.

 &gt;&gt;

Particulars may vary...In this instance, stock valve covers probably are
better, but only because the replacements are of inferior design/man-
ufacture. I imagine a wildly expensive alloy cover would be a marginally
effective upgrade to stock. 
Price is a big consideration for what's stock on any car. My best guess
on the disappearance of the removable valance beneath the engine
hatch on post '71 type 2's was manufacturing cost...A quick poll of
owners would probably show a preference for a van with both the en-
gine upper hatch AND a removable valence...
And as for the heating system...That stock &quot;tin&quot; (especially the &quot;Y&quot;
that connects both heat exchangers to one tube), something could
have been used that wouldn't be so corrosion prone considering where
it is...If someone else was paying for it, I'd go for carbon fiber and
never worry about it again ;-)
I'd like to see other ideas along these lines...Any &quot;upgrades&quot; that would
retain the original idea(s), but result in a forever bus...?-)
