Subject: Buses Of The Corn - The short report

Hi Volks,

Elvis has left the building. BOTC 2003 drew to a close this morning at 
about 11AM.

We had 41 buses attending, and a good mix of splits, bays and vanagons 
were represented, including a Country Homes diesel and 2 synchro 
westfalias. The weather was good, the corn was great and spirits were 
very high.

Highlights of the weekend included a Burrito Breakfast, a Live morning 
radio interview  on CHWO AM740, stripping parts from a 73 Westy , the 
Tie Dye Workshop, the Bus Driving Competition, Frisbee Golf, Kids Water 
Balloon fight &amp; Scavenger Hunt, The Corn Roast, Awards, Campfire and a 
case burning. And just before I went to bed on the busiest day of my 
life I managed to find time to replace the starter on my camper while 
my wife slept blissfully inside it. The camper I mean. No-one can sleep 
in a starter. ;^)

The long trip report will be going online soon, but for now I will 
leave you with the illustrated edition:

Big thanks MUST go out to Collie Corner at GermanSupply_dot_com, Adam 
Narraway, Mike &amp; Heather Schmitz, Jamie &amp; Christina Auch and to my 
Family. You guys were Great, and I couldn't have done it without you.

Happy trails Indeed,
