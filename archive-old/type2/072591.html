Subject: vacuum advance; one more time

Sorry to belabor this point once again, but I just bought a rebuilt Bosch
dual diaphram distributor to replace the 009 which is now on my engine. I
wanted to apply vacuum to test this feature before I actually installed it.
I started by  reading through the notes I have accumulated from the list to
see which port I apply the vacuum to.

I never made it back to the garage. I'm confused about the workings of that
distributor.  Several have posted  detailed descriptions.  The concensus
goes something like this.  At idle,  one of the two vacuum lines from the
carb yanks on the plate and moves it to a new orientation where the timing
is retarded.  As one pushes on the accelerator pedal, the throttle plate
opens. This applies vacuum to the second line running from the carb.  At
low speeds, this yanks the plate in the opposite direction to a new
orientation sligltly less retarded than the first. At some speed,
compensation is complete and timing returns to the point set by you and me
when we tighten that 10mm nut.  If that point is TDC, then all cylinders
fire at TDC.  No advance. No retard.  At still higher speeds, mechanical
actions take over to provide spark advance with respect to the set point of
TDC.

If this description is correct, then I have a few questions:
1. Why is this distributor called a &quot;vacuum advance&quot; distributor?  In fact,
it seems that vacuum doesn't advance the spark at all. It only retards it.
2. I always heard that the big difference between 009 and stock
distributors was that even at low speeds an engine needs some spark
advance.  The 009 cannot provide  advance until higher speeds but the stock
distributor can because it uses vacuum to do the advancing. This doesn't
jibe with the explanation above.

Can anyone help?

Jack
