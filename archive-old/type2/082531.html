Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel sensor accessability

Hi Theodore,
While you're right in terms of ease of repair there
are a couple of factors that make that impossible for
me.
1.While I can do little stuff, like starter motors &amp;
the like, I don't trust myself or have the tools to do
an engine pull.
2.I live in the country &amp; don't have a paved or
concrete area I could carry out such a manouvre so I'm
forced to pay a mechanic to do it(which frankly is
safer although costlier).
Thanks for advice anyway.
Cheers

&gt; There was a post earlier today in which a person
&gt; described lowering the
&gt; engine some and removing the tank that way. I guess
&gt; if you have FI you
&gt; could do it but honestly pulling the motor is not
&gt; that big of a deal. On my
&gt; 78' I leave the trans bolted to the motor and just
&gt; pop the front trans
&gt; mount, mustache bar, and rear trans hangers, a few
&gt; wires, clutch and accel
&gt; cable, and a fuel line and carefully lower the whole
&gt; shebang on a floor
&gt; jack. Install is much easier this way as you dont
&gt; have to wiggle and push
&gt; to get the input shaft into the tranny...
&gt;      I bet there are othe rthings you would love to
&gt; take care of while that
&gt; motor is out anyway. Easily done in a weekend.

&gt; &gt;Andrew,
&gt; &gt;I also live about 12 miles from town, and I have
&gt; the same model fuel
&gt; guage:
&gt; &gt;reads well when tank is full but after 30 miles it
&gt; reads empty. I am
&gt; waiting
&gt; &gt;to fix it until I have to remove the engine anyway.
&gt; In the mean time, I
&gt; have
&gt; &gt;a post-it note on the dash on which I write down
&gt; the mileage for the next
&gt; &gt;fill-up. To be on the safe side, I fill after 150
&gt; miles (250km?) even
&gt; though
&gt; &gt;I get more miles than that out of a tank of gas.
&gt; 
&gt; Initially I did the same, except I used one of those
&gt; little plastic mileage
&gt; 
&gt; indicators with the moveable dials so you can set it
&gt; to any mileage.  Got
&gt; it at Poop Boys for a few dollars.  You could also
&gt; do what I did later -
&gt; install a Vanagon speedo and use the trip meter. 
&gt; :-)  I can almost
&gt; guarantee you that your sender is bad as my symptoms
&gt; were identical to
&gt; yours.  I've heard that it's possible to swap out
&gt; the sender with the tank
&gt; in place, without cutting through the floor!  If
&gt; you're a contortionist
&gt; maybe?  Not tried it though.  I removed my tank
&gt; while the engine was out
&gt; for a rebuild (and even then it was a dirty, PITA
&gt; job).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Just yesterday I filled up
&gt; &gt;after pushing the mileage limits a bit. The book
&gt; says that the tank holds
&gt; &gt;14.8 gallons but the fuel pump registered 14.9! I
&gt; guess I cut that one a
&gt; &gt;little close.
&gt; 
&gt; I've put as much as 15.2 gallons in without running
&gt; out, but I fill it
&gt; until the fuel level is 2&quot; below the cap.  I have to
&gt; put the last 2 gallons
&gt; 
&gt; or so in very slowly.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Anyway, just set yourself a reasonable mileage
&gt; range between fill-ups and
&gt; &gt;fix the sender when you have the engine out for
&gt; other work.
&gt; 
&gt; I think that's a great idea!
&gt;
