Subject: turn signals, yeah!!
Mime-Version: 1.0

well, i received my emergency flasher switch on monday and installed 
it.  now i have turn signals again...yipee!  this installation brought up a 
question or two.

1)  the new switch had one extra &quot;pole&quot; than my old one.  (i have 1975 
westy.)  i essentially just took out each wire from the old one and 
systematically place them in the new one (also by following the numbers on 
the plastic on the old and new switch.)  the extra one has a 58f (or was it 
54f?) next to it.  my old switch didn't have this one.  i checked it, and 
it doesn't have live power with the key off.  the bentley didn't have a 'f' 
category.  am i reading the manual wrong?

2)  the &quot;pole&quot; with live power (i believe it was #30.)  had an &quot;splitter&quot; 
on it.  one goes to the cig. lighter, while the other goes to the accessory 
plug (heavier gauge wire) under the glove box.

so, what it the extra &quot;pole&quot; for?  and also, i picked up a VDO clock from a 
junkyard and placed it in my console.  i was wonder what the best way was 
to run live power to it.  I don't think I'll ever use the accessory plug, 
because i don't have the attachment for it.

anyway, any insight would be appreciated.
thanks in advance

p.s. my $400 worth of suspension parts are on their way, so be prepared for 
more, &quot;what is this thingy?&quot; questions......
