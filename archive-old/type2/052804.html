Subject: Thanks!! (Re: Towing Advice?)

Hi all,

Thanks so much for all of the excellent reponses. We managed to dig up a
UHaul branch (with the help of our local branch.. very nice guy) that had an
available full trailer (these seem to be hard to get around here for some
reason?). I'd much rather be extra safe and have all four wheels off the
ground. We'll be driving their truck too which is a giant box with wheels.
:-P We're not too thrilled about the lack of visibility, but we'll deal with
it. We're not towing from Texas to Canada anyway, just 45 miles, so it
shouldn't be too hair raising except going over the Throg's Neck Bridge
(yes, I'm going from the Bronx to the Island here in NY). It's supposed to
be cold and &quot;blustery&quot; here tomorrow so I'm going to try to bring a camera
to get photos of us getting blown off the bridge and plummetting into the
freezing water below..... if not that, I'll be lucky if I still have
fingernails after the trip.

Anyway, I'm really looking forward to getting my hands on this great bus
ASAP to save it from the relatively mild to barely moderate non-structural
rust (yes, in NY) that is emerging... especially on the front where Bond-o
(sp?) was used to &quot;repair&quot; a run-in with a deer. Must have been a small-ish
deer though. Not bad yet, but will be.

We got it from a guy whose father got it new from Germany way back when. The
son has barely driven it (except apparently for deer hunting.. haha) and
alleges that it only has 56,000+ miles on it and not 156,000+. We'll have to
see when we look at it more closely but it was examined pretty thoroughly
(aka anally) before we bought it but mainly we were focussing on the body
condition of course.

You've wished me luck already and thanks for that. I'm sure I'll be asking
questions upon questions in the future.

Jen :-D
