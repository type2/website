Subject: Westy interior needs

Volks- thanks for the responses I got to my last posting about a rear
shelf. My wife just reminded me (what would I do without her?... probably
drink more beer) that we are also looking for a front console/middle seat
that goes in between the front seats. I'm NOT talking about the stool,
I've already got one of those, but the part I'm talking about is a
console of sorts- it actually opens up and you can put stuff inside. I
saw one in my friend's '75 westy and fell in love with it. If you've got
one you are willing to part with, please p-mail me. Thanks,
Joel
