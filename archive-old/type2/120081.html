If you spray oil in there you will oil the shoes.  Are the shoes worth
saving?

Are you sure that the shoes are what are preventing the drum from being
removed?  If it doesn't move at all it isn't the shoes.

If the drums are very worn they could hold the drums in place, but there
would be a little play to work with.

Be sure that you're getting good leverage on the stars.  Use a proper
brake tool, not a screwdriver.

When you get the thing apart, be sure to clean the adjusters and their
sockets completely, then coat all surfaces with anti-sieze grease.  This
is what anti-sieze is good for.
