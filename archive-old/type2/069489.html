&gt;The 3/4&quot; and the 46mm socket will prolly be the more expensive route though.

Just for cost reference, I just bought a 3/4&quot; metric drive set -which 
includes the 46mm socket- from Harbour Freight for $44.95. If you can 
find else they sell to boost your order over $50, shipping will be free.

Got to get those hubs off the Derelict '64!
