Subject: Re: [T2] my $100 paint job

Is it a 20 footer, or a 60 footer is a question regarding how it looks
at any given distance.

I use the nose to the paint job quality---
so you could shave in the finished product.

And my paint lasts for years not weeks.

I have a real hard time justifying a shody paint job, with jippo
materials for the time it should take to do the job right.

Different strokes for different folks ----

&quot; The bitternees of poor quality remains long after the sweetness of the
good deal is gone&quot;

BTW--I paint for a living--and not houses--

Don't understand this question. 
For all the work that you did to get the bus a uniform color you should 
have spent a couple of more bucks for premium materials to make the
finished product last. 
Dude, I researched my options, the money to get a sprayer, and decent
paint and everything to do a good paintjob would have been more
expensive as my whole bus. 
I just hate doing the same job twice.
especially one of this magnitude. 
What are you talking about? I had a blast taking my bus apart and
painting it, I want to do it again, I'm thinking cherry red with black
bumpers......or maybe a dark blue with white bumpers.
