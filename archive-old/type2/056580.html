Subject: Re: New Product...mosquito screens

&lt;&lt;New Product!
 (old product I made for myself years ago, a few people saw them and said
I should go into business!)
I have magnetic screens for the front door windows and a giant mosquito
screen for the open cargo door. The latter has snaps and magnets for easy
exit.    How is thecool factor on these?  Would they be worth making 20 of
them?  I never found the rear screen was enough ventilation.
I like to sew, I could be encouraged to do some if there were interest.&gt;&gt;

Rex,

I know I would be interested in your mosquito screens for the front
windows and sliding door.  I think that would provide great air
circulation.  Just hope they aren't too expensive :)
