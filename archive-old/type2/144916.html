&gt; Has anyone ever come across a cheaply priced headlight aimer like you
used to see in the old days at any garage. They would suction cup it on
to your headlight then adjust your headlight to the correct specs?? All
the ones I see are 1000's of dollars!!

I remember them, but I never had one.  I just point the car down the
street, adjust the beams to where they look good, take a walk 100 yards or
so down the block, squat down to driver's eye height, and make sure that
the beam isn't glaring.

There are also ways to adjust them on a wall.  IIRC, some of these methods
are covered in the service manuals.
