	Hello list,

	Is there an simple way to tell the difference betveen trannies for type1
and type4 engines? My problem is that i´m going to put a type4 engine in my
´71 Kombi. It´s time to put in a better tranny in the same operation. The
local junkyard has lots of busses but here in Finland most busses where
sold with the type1 engine up to 1979. Only a few has the type4 engine.
Don´t know if there´s any major differences between the trannies but i´m
told that the engine doesn´t fit the tranny i´m using now. The engine i´m
going to use is a fuel injected 1800cc from a type4 car.

TIA
