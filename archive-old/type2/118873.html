Subject: Re: [T2] Generator melt down

&gt; Hello Jamie    It shorted out. I would change over to an Alt. at this time
&gt; Bosch number Al82N  brand new  Cost me $110.00 but does come with internal
&gt; regulator and is brand new. You willl also have to chage the stand.

If you are currently running a 38 amp generator, then you will also need to
replace the backing plates.


Thank You
