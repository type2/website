Subject: bosch distributor

I've been of the list for awhile with the 71 sitting in my garage waiting for
an engine.  By shear luck ran into a fellow that has a 71 that he's selling
and though its a rust bucket the engine is in good shape.  My question is that
it has a Bosch distributor VJR 4 BR 18.  It fires right up but I'm unfamiliar
with this distributor.  It looks pretty worn.  Anyone have any info on this
distributor....pros/cons
Thanks in advance
