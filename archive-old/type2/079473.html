Subject: Re: [T2] Heating with water - seeking what-if-ideas

Hmm - solar water heater ideas...


&gt;Thermosiphon's the name of the system...Pretty simple, really; hot water's
&gt;lighter and rises in the pipes, cools in the radiators and falls back down to
&gt;the boiler to be reheated. Lots of old houses used the system (saves on
&gt;parts), but usually a little tricky in the initial set-up to get a &quot;balanced&quot;
&gt;system. Old cars, same effect...Hot water flows up the pipe to the rad-
&gt;iator, replaced by cooler water from the bottom of the radiator.
&gt;Gravity feed hot air systems in old houses - same principle (but it works
&gt;better with a nice steady coal-fired furnace ;-)

Ciao!
