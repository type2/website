Subject: 77 Bus needs home in Davis, CA, Cheep must move soon!

When I bought my 78 Westy earlier this year, my friend also had a 77 
Bus - 3 seats, sun roof and station wagon interior for.  Like the 
Westy, she and her husband ran out of $$ about halfway through the 
restoration and moved on to other things.

This is one interesting bus.  You look in the engine compartment and 
it's all new looking.  But the interior is rough.  Seats are good 
except for Drivers.  Headlining amazingly is OK.  But side cardboard 
interior panels are not good.

Body is solid and rust free but roof needs repainting.   Two or three 
dents which are easily fixed.  Needs left rear marker light.  Orange 
and White

Has crank sunroof which rolls back into roof over engine compartment. 
Did I mention 5 new tires?  Does not start but turns over.

My friend wants $400 to $500 AS IS but needs to move it in a week.  I 
may buy it to avoid it being junked but I live in an apartment and 
have no place to put it!

Contact me directly and I'll put you in touch with the owner or show 
you the bus.
