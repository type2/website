Subject: Re: [T2] have to keep push starting/ignition switch prob???

If your starter motor doesn't even turn over (ie, nothing happens when you
turn the ignition) after travelling for a good amount of time (so the engine
is nice and hot), it could be the same problem I had driving back from
France in August. On long and hot journeys, the starter motor expands in
it's case, so when you come to start your engine after a quick stop, the
starter motor is jammed and won't turn. The only solution I know of is to
wait for it to cool or bump start it down a hill (as you said). Of course if
this doesn't help, this probably isn't the problem.

&gt; howdy all :O)
&gt;
&gt;  I'm havin a prob with my ignition switch on my 78
&gt; bus. It seems as when I go on long trips, such as the
&gt; one I just took, my bus wont start by turnin the key.
&gt; I replaced the starter before I drove down to St.Pete,
&gt; FL a couple days ago and it still is havin trouble and
&gt; its a pain in the ass tryin to push start the thing on
&gt; flat grounds. Up in NC it wasnt a big deal :O) But if
&gt; anyone could help me out on this one I would really
&gt; appreciate it. I went and bought an ignition switch
&gt; but am clueless of the procedure of puttin it in. Do I
&gt; have to pull the whole steering column off?? Help me
&gt; out here ..... :O)
&gt;
&gt;
