Subject: Those bleedin' brakes, Pt II

Hi list - thanks for the bleedin' help so far...

Part II
When I mentioned that my method of bleeding yielded trouble free results at 
the back two wheels, BUT big and small bubbles at the front two wheels, Some 
of you suggested that the master cylinder might be gone.
How do I know for sure? Is there a simple in-place test?

There was one suggestion that since the bleeders are high up at the back, 
but low to the road at the front that I may have raise the wheel off the 
ground, or lower the catchment vessel to BELOW the bleeder?
(I dropped Physics 11, although this seems like a Science 8 question)

And for some reason, I thought that the brake system was split diagonally, 
not front/back, for safety reasons. True?

Continued thanks
Duane
