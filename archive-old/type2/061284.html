Re tire sizes....
I have a 73 Westy and I just installed Firestone 'F480'  215/70R14  M+S
tires on the stock 14x6 rims.  They fit well, don't change the final drive
ration to any great degree and ride great with about 28 lbs all around with
no load.  If I load all our stuff along with the kids and dogs, I'll
probably air up the tires to 30 in front and 32 in back.  I like the larger
'footprint' of these tires, and I can let a bunch of air out when we travel
outback to the more remote sandy roads in So Calif or Nevada.   Ray Cellar,
