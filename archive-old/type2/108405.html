I don't think this is necessarily a wise move.  When VW stopped using the
cylinder/head sealing ring they also started using a thicker cylinder/case
sealing ring to add back the deck height lost when the head sealing ring is
removed.  Who the heck knows *what* GEX did in this case?  Unless I was to
tear the engine down far enough that I could check the cylinder/case rings
I'd leave the head sealing rings in place.  To simply remove them at this
point risks setting the engine up with a too-high compression ratio.

&gt; &gt; i bought a 74 westy with a 2.0L single carb'd GEX rebuild with only a
few
&gt; &gt; thousand miles on it. when i bought it cylinders 1, 2, &amp; 4 were firing
&gt; &gt; around 120 but my #3 cylinder was losing alot of compression. upon
tearing
&gt; &gt; the engine apart i have found that the head gasket is cracked/broken
which
&gt; &gt; deffinitely could bethe culprit.
&gt;
&gt; OK, then- So you bought it. Then you heard GEX is bad.
&gt; So you took it apart and discovered the primary problem.
&gt; You would like to reassemble it at this point, but don't
&gt; confident that this engine will be as dependable as you
&gt; might like. A very wise deduction.
&gt;
&gt; For cheap, remove all the head gaskets, bolt it up and go.
&gt; GEX maybe hasn't seen the vw service recommendation.
