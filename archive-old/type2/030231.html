&gt; &gt; By the way, the Mobil syntho came in a 0W30 grade. 0W???? What kind of
&gt; &gt; engine would use a 0 weight?

the oil weight is simply a number that relates to the speed at which the
oil passes through a specified orifice at a specified temperature.  The
number before the &quot;W&quot; gives the viscosity of the oil at a low temperature
while the number after gives the viscosity at a higher temperature.

Modern cars tend to use lower viscosity oil as it causes less drag to
engine parts.
