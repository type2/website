Subject: Re: [T2] 1970 westy~sliding door inside handle PART #

ok, i just went to the bus and removed the remaining piece, put them
together and here is the part number:
231-843-642 (followed by tiny VW emblem)-greyish handle, looks like a
hammer head with a metal insert in the center, with a square hole.
 
i have yet to see or hear of another like it from any of the nice people
who have explained what the handle should look like, that is why i am
wondering if this is not the original handle. is this stock for a 70? if
not, then i guess it doesnt matter what i replace it with, as long as i
dont HAVE to add a rear handle. wait... there are two bolts where that
rear handle might go, but there is no hole for the handle mechanism to
fit through... honestly, the front handle latches the back of the door by
turning it backwards. i doubt this door had a second handle.

the pic of the one on ebay showed an armrest next to the door... that
would mean a newer bus than mine because my closet/cabinet is next to the
door, right? perhaps they didnt use a second handle til after 70? well,
maybe this part number will help clear up my confusion, if someone could
look it up and tell me what it is... i just looked in my &quot;glovebox
edition WCM catalog&quot; with a list of part #s in the back... it isn't even
listed. can i assume by that, that it is not listed because it is not
available as an aftermarket part?

thanks, guys, for all your help,
chris, the confused, girlie one
