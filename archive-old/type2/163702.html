Subject: change of plan looking for carberator

Instead of converting to the FI system from a 75 westy to my wife's 72  westy 
I'm going with a carb on the 1800cc engine.  
 
I have the intakes for a Weber progressive so I'm interested in buying or  
trading  for a known good Weber carb.
 
I have a whole 75 westy with a very nice complete  interior with blue  plaid 
interior (full length Zbed)
 
any interest please Email me.
 
thanks Mario
