&gt;So, hint, if your are concerned about your emissions exam, get your idle speed up to 950 at warmed engine.  Or not . . .

That is an old trick to clean up emissions, right up there with retarding the timing and installing a clean air filter.  Well, the air filter is not really a trick - a clean one is always a good idea.  Find out what the maximum allowable idle rpm is and set your engine to 50rpm or so less for cleaner emissions.
