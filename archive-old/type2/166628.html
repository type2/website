&gt;I've hardly ever seen the timing change one iota after swapping a
point
&gt;set.

&gt;But I've never moved the distributor either when I've changed them ---

I've tried working on the distributor in situ and discovered
that I'm not a very good contortionist. ;-)  To work on the
distributor, I prefer to remove it from the T4 engine and do
the job on the workbench.  I also carry two old oven mitts
(in case the engine is hot) and a tach/dwell meter.
