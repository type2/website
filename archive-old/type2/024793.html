Subject: Towing a T2 without a towing eye
Message-ID: &lt;90e69438.24479251_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Hi Folks,

First lets make it clear that I haven't broken down and I don't intend to ;-) 
but while fitting my front spoiler (air dam) the other day I noticed that 
there was no towing eye on the front of the chassis!!!!

Now this is a 1998 T2 so there is no over enthusiastic previous owner 
involved, maybe its an expression of VW do Brazil's expected mean time 
between failure statistics, but it leaves me in a quandry.

The long term solution is clearly to get some suitable bar bent to a suitable 
shape and welded in place (oxyacetylene rather than MIG). Comments welcome.

In the short term where would &quot;the list&quot; suggest I attach a tow rope should I 
be unfortunate enough to breakdown (or even to get stuck in some mud)?

Good luck
Bob
