&gt; sorry, had to say that.
&gt; Why would you do that, when air cooling is so cool?!?
&gt; 

     Air-cooling isn't very cool, that's the problem. Air-cooled engines
run much hotter than water-cooled, and thus have significantly shorter
life-spans. You also have a serious problem with taking heat *off* the
engine to warm your car. Don't know where you live, but I've spent many
a winter in N. Minn. with a VW which didn't have enough heat to even
defrost the windshield when it was below zero, which it was for weeks at
a time. We had to drive with the vent windows open to keep the
windshield defrosted. Fun, fun, fun!
