First of all THANKS EVERYONE who responded! Not at my computer so I don't
have access to my saved list or I'd name you in person.

What it turn out to be:
Don't know what you call it but there is a big round thing (herein referred
to as BRT) on the back of the air cleaner that connects to the evap canister
and intake distributor. Anyway a vacumn leak opened up at the BRT and that
threw the idle totally out of whack. NOT to stop there though, maybe becuase
a winter of driving and not paying attention to it but at cruising speed
problems started to occur deeper in the system. I poped the lid on the AFC
(after exhaustive ignition and fuel system testing) and what I had prayed
wouldn't be the case was. There is about a quater inch of white showing
through the black resistive contact surface on both of the wiper tracks.
Repaired the same and can give detailed instruction to anyone who wants
them. Works better now, BUT the best is yet to come, took the van out to see
if everything works right and about a mile from my house boom, bang, BOOM.
Birds flew, engine stopped dead in the middle of an intersection, heart
sank... Ran around to the back, chanting to the beast (imagine that), pulled
the coil wire and, using the remote starter looked for spark. There was
none. Pulled cap again using remote starter (you really need one of these)
looked with horror at a rotor that wasn't moving! Pushed on it... contact!,
turning and, move fingers quickly, ouch. With all the fooling around, the
dizzy had worked it's way up the clamp and was just barely in the keyed
slot. Dropped the dizzy back to where it belonged and back on the road in
under 15 minutes. Much more stable sounding too.

Up over the mountains from Western Washington to Eastern Washington already.
Will be back in W-WA by Monday and 1,200 more miles on the van. AGAIN -
thanks for all the suggestions and I hope some of this may help someone in
the future.

79 VW Van
Fly fishing for peace of mind.
