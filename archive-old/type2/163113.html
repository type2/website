Subject: Re: [T2] Pain(t)/body

I had mine done at the local Miracle Auto Body and Paint (Alameda, CA).

Overall I am very pleased with the results. I changed the color, so
the van got painted inside and out (I had removed _everything_ except
the dash and steering wheel). Two tone (Miami Blue bottom and snow
white top and interior), and a substantial amount of body work (dents
only, no rust). $3250 for all (about $1200 was body work). The next
lowest estimate I had was more than double what I paid.

I have not yet completed the interior, but won first in class at the
Madera, CA Spring Fling in April (thanks again for your support,
Karl).

My only complaint is that the body shop repaired only the dents I
pointed out when I delivered the van. I would have perferred that they
called me with a revised estimate when they discovered all the other
minor defects that I missed rather that going ahead with the final
coat. I would have gladly paid for the additional work.

I have also had work done at other inexpensive paint shops with better
that expected results.

My caveats are that while these places are better than average at
applying the paint, they are worse than average at prep, including
tape/mask. The more prep you do, the better the results. Do some
research, ask around, get your prospective painter to show you some of
his work.

Personally, I think five grand is way out of line for a simple single
color exterior color paint job.
