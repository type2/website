Subject: Converting from Weber single carb BACK to Fuel Injection?

Hi everyone-

On my 1979 Deluxe Westy with 2.0 motor (less than 300 miles on COMPLETE 
rebuild) I cannot seem to get the Weber/Holley 2 bbl. progressive carb 
to dial in right.  The vehicle stumbles and misses slightly in 2 3 and 
4th under acceleration.  I have tried both a new &quot;009&quot; distributor and 
what came on the bus &quot;021 905 205 S&quot; with new points, and neither makes 
any difference (with the &quot;009&quot; having a little less stumble).

Rather than pay someone $60.00 per hour for endless bouts of plug 
chopping, rejetting  and trying to tune this carb (which I have been 
advised by &quot;aircooled_dot_net&quot; and others is absolutely the WRONG carb for 
my vehicle!), I have decided to take up a guy's offer for a COMPLETE 
original Fuel Injection system, being taken from a running '78 Westy 
(the guy's going diesel, and doesn't need the motor).

So, in all your combined experience, does anyone have any advice for a 
fuel injection newby....things to look out for, pitfalls to avoid, 
pecadillos of this particular system to watch.....in other words, things 
I have no way of knowing, while some of you may?  I can only hope that 
the PO did not ruin anything on this camper that will make the 
installation more of the fuel injection more than the average nightmare.

Any advice?  Thanks in advance!
