I placed an order with Berg yesterday for some other stuff, and they told me they're building some shifters right now, and they'll be available in about a week.  It's the whole assembly, including knob, shaft, mounting plate, etc...  It's said to be much more solid-feeling than stock, as well as smoother, with a shorter throw.  Also, it's angled back toward the driver, so there's less reaching.. They have a locking shifter, which is the one I'll want.

&gt;  Are we talking the whole shifter here? Heck, I'd be interested in that...
