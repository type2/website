Well, I'm not much for public mourning. I don't mind others doing it; I just prefer to do mine in private. I've said goodbye to Josh in my own way and of course I pray for peace for him and his family and friends.

I hope I've not overstepped any bounds, but I've been busy for the past couple of hours downloading copies of the information on Josh's Camper pages. It occurs to me that I probably won't get much more of his site archived. I'm doing this to assure that the work he put forth is preserved; not to steal his work. I don't know how to handle this once Compu$erve shuts off his account, but I'm sure they eventually will and if we capture the data somewhere, we can preserve it, giving credit to Josh, of course.

If others of you would care to locally archive some of Josh's other pages, please drop me a note. At a later date, we can coordinate re-serving of these pages as appropriate. I will have all the camper pages archived in a few minutes. I have noticed that there are links to many of other sites that are imbedded in his frames. I pulled down some files off these by accident, but I can clean all that up later. Just pointing it out to make it easier for any of you who encounter similar situations.

Thanks! Joe
