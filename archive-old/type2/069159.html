Subject: gas smell in 73 camper van

I experienced this in my 78 &quot;Honey&quot; after purchasing her several years 
ago.  After some investigating I discovered that the rubber fill 
adapter was split and needed to be replaced.  I had to remove the cpu 
to get to it and it was tricky but the fresh air was worth it.
