.Are you guys talking about those &quot;put-on-top-of-your-vehicle&quot; things 
that look like a squashed version of a pop-top that sleeps two?  The 
one I saw was perched on top of a 4X4 I found in a copy of the 
TRAVEL magazine I was thumbing though,  in the ads section.  I 
thought, man!  The price of this thing is nearly  $1,200! ( and that 
was $200 more than the '77 Westy I was considering buying)  :0

It is an old idea turned &quot;modern&quot;, but the cost doesn't justify the 
merchandise, IMHO.  :)  I would much rather camp in a Westy!
