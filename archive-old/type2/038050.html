Subject: oil leak

Hi guys please help,
I am a new bus owmer (76 Kombi) in Australia trying to sort out the problems
the PO found too hard and get my bus to a reliable condition.
th oil seal at the fan end of the crank appears to be leaking and hence oil
in blowing through my engine and especially into the heat exchangers with a
smoky result.
consulted the Hanes manual and the archives but
-can I replace it without pulling the engine
-any special tools ,procedures etc

any advice would be appreciated

thanks

jeff Highland
