Subject: Spongebob bus source (kinda)

Alright so I'm stretching the rules a little because it's friday &amp;
this is about a toy bus. Those of you my age might remember the
&quot;Stomper&quot; toy trucks that ran on one AA battery. Well they are back
again. What I'm trying to do is find a model/toy/whatever body of a
bus (my preference would be a split panel but i'm not picky) so that I
can put it on the chassis of the stomper. I thought since I have made
my own bus how I want with parts from many different years, why stop
there. I'll make my own toys also. Wheelbase on these guys is around
2&quot; w/ a 2&quot; wide track. TIA
