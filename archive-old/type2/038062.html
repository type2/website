Subject: Re: oil leak

Hi Jeff:

I had a severe oil leak on my '76 Campmobile and a few weeks ago the list 
helped me diagnose that the pushrod tube seals were leaking.  I had them 
replaced at a local VW shop and am extremely pleased with the results.

I don't know about the crank seals but it's worth consideration to take a 
look at the pushrod tubes.  It's not necessary to remove the engine to 
replace those seals.

Good luck,
Walt Fogle
