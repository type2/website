Subject: Re:My Breaking Points,  winter gas mileage

	Way to go, Charlie! So far I've had points problems four times in
my life, and I only manged to trouble shoot them the second and 
fourth time. Someone else fixed it the first and third times.

	The heat-riser is indeed supposed warm the fuel-air mixture to help
evaporate the gasoline for carb'ed cars. Only gasses burn, not solids or
liquids, which is why its so hard to light a log with a match. :) 
	In  the late 1960s Porsche had problems with unburned hydrocarbon 
emissions on the 911s- turned out the sexy triple-choke carbs on the 
Porsche  aircooled sixes were designed for an ALFA V-6 and had a little 
adaptor  manifold that stretches the spacing of the carb from ALFA water-
cooled size to Porsche air-cooled size. So there are bends in the passages on
the outside, and droplets of fuel would colide with the walls of the tube,
coalesce, grow, then fall off and go through the engine, finally evaporating
in the exhaust stream!
	The elves at Porsche band-aided the problem by having the adaptor
tubes Teflon (tm) coated so the droplets of fuel would fall off before
they got too big to evaporate and combust...

	I don't have cold-enough-weather  experience to have noticed the 
drop in milage. :)

	Merry Christmas, Happy Chaunakakh, hope you had a nice winter solstice,
see ya at the end-of-Ramadan party, and let me be the first to say
Gung Ho Fat Choy! :) See ya the last year of the millennium!

	Love to all,
	Bill
