Subject: Re: [T2] AFM adjustment of spring tension-how?

Your post uses the word &quot;resistance&quot; in a way that it's not clear exactly
what you're talking about.  There's the (mechanical) resistance of the
spring to the opening of the air vane, and then there's the (electrical)
resistance of the strip inside the AFM to current flow, which resistance is
dependent on the position of the air vane and the corresponding point of
contact between the wiper arm and the track.  I don't know if the engine's
demand for more air - which implies more mechanical resistance as the spring
resists the opening of the air vane - translates directly into more
electrical resistance as the wiper arm moves.

But, Al's correct that, over time, the spring weakens, resulting in a
general &quot;too rich&quot; situation that can't be adjusted out using the regular
idle mixture control.  And no, the AFM flap/resistance circuit is *not*
uninvolved when the engine is idling.  The minute you start the engine the
air vane moves from its &quot;resting&quot; position to a position corresponding the
the engine's air demand, be this &quot;idle&quot; or &quot;wide open throttle.&quot;

In this situation you need to tighten the spring to provide more mechanical
resistance to the swing of the air vane until the electrical resistance,
whatever that is, is &quot;correct&quot; for the arm's position.  The only way to do
this &quot;in situ&quot; is to monitor the exhaust as you change the position of the
spring (engine idling) until the exhaust CO is &quot;correct.&quot;   This calls for
either an O2 sensor which you monitor or, better, an exhaust gas analyzer.
And, be warned, when you remove the plastic cover on the AFM to start
messing with the spring you typically introduce an air leak through the AFM
itself so it sometimes takes several trys (adjust with cover off, check with
cover on) until you get it right.

&gt; quoth Al Brase: (re how to adjustg the AFM spring, in response to a
&gt; query about adjusting the CO emissions when the airscrew in the AFM did
&gt; not reduce it far enough)-
&gt;  That's simple, tighter makes it leaner (more air volume for the same
&gt;  electrical signal).
&gt; Whoa- let's see if I get this-a given air volume (throttle opening
&gt; relative to gas pedal push) opens the flap in the afm against spring
&gt; tension....and the resistance read on the wiper arm by the &quot;brain&quot; tells
&gt; the injectors how much gas to give relative to the perceived air
&gt; volume.  So if the spring weakens over many years, it will let the flap
&gt; open FURTHER than normal, and the resistance is higher and the brain is
&gt; fooled into assuming you have a higher air flow than is reality- and
&gt; lets more gas through the injectors.
&gt;      So the general richness observed in my still functioning 240,000
&gt; mile FI system (based on blackness in exhaust pipe) -suggests the spring
&gt; in the AFM is a bit pooped - how do you know how much to tighten the
&gt; spring- is there a table anywhere relating spring tension to ACTUAL
&gt; opening of the flap or the resistance it represents?  Like our lungs,
&gt; air is pulled through the AFM- How does this sound-can a variable shop
&gt; vac be hooked to the throttle side, and the resistance be measured
&gt; against a given volume/time .  I envision setting the seconds it takes
&gt; to fill a garbage bag of known dimensions in X time using the setting on
&gt; the vac control- ie, what is the resistance setting on a good AFM to
&gt; fill a 4 or 6 cubic foot bag in say, 20 seconds??   Another way wouold
&gt; be to measure the resistance of a good AFM in a vehicle at a given RPM,
&gt; or perhaps, a given exhaust volume in X time??  BTW, in NJ, they check
&gt; old cars with the engine at idle- and I thought the AFM Flap/resistance
&gt; circuit was uninvolved at idle, letting air bleed by...and a a high
&gt; reading is likely more due to leaks of fuel into the air post AFM??
