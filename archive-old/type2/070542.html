Hay all,
 I had Boston bob build an engine for me 4 years ago and it's still running 
strong.
 He grinds valves with 7 angles, lowers compression and does great things to 
the crank.
 When I ever need another re build bob's the one I'll goto.
 My bus went from east coast to the west and back since then
 and the only thing that went wrong was a sunk lifter.
