&gt;The missing linkage *should* be the same for all air cooled FI buses.
&gt;When I have serviced the EGR valve unit, I have always had to remove the
&gt;valve and the nut on top of the butterbly shaft of the throttle body.  It
&gt;has been a while and i forget exactly why, but I think the ends do not
&gt;come out of either end peacefully.
&gt;
&gt;Please give Bill a hand if you have one of these pups in your parts stash!

For reasons I can't imagine I had one of these sitting on my dining
room table as I read Bill's message, it is his as soon as he sends
me an adress so no one else fret it.
