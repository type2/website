Subject: Tranny Swap (different question)

So, I'm flipping through th recent hot VW's looking for JB Heater
Source, when I come across an article regarding beefing up your tranny.
Now, when I bought my bus, it wasn't 'streetable', and I've been 'fixing
it' for a while now. I've only driven it a few times but I have noticed
that I have to basically floor it to even get moving. Perhaps it is the
weight=momentum that helps it breeze along once it gets up to speed, but
getting there is usually half the battle.
Some details, its a 1968 Westy. It has a 1600 single port motor (all
original except the case which  had to be replaced with brazil case
before the bus came into my hands), with the original tranny. Now going
through the article in hotVW's it seems these are a pretty under
powered, under geared bus. Now most magazines have a zillion hook ups,
and seem to get a lot of work done pretty, well, pretty 'cheap'(free).
Those of us in the real world, with real world garages and real world
tool boxes, and real world wallets probably couldn't do the kind of work
they are doing in this article. So now the question, is there a better
tranny that I could be looking for to swap into the bus. In this article
they also mentioned that '68 was a 1 year tranny so many parts may be
hard to come by, so a swap seems to me to be good idea. Suggestions?

'68 Westy 'Dad-e-van'
Which still  isn't  on  the  damn road yet.
