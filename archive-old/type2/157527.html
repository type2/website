&gt; Here's another easy trick for one-person brake bleeding.
&gt;
&gt; Get a length of about 3 feet of clear hose that fits on the bleeder
&gt; nipple.

If you know someone in the medical business, ask them for an old oxygen
hose. They're considered disposable, so they go through a lot of them.
They are made of thin clear tubing and have a fitting on the end
that seems like it was _made_ to go on the bleeder. It goes on easily,
doesn't slip off, and allows bubbles to be seen easily. The small
diameter keeps the fluid flowing fast enough to carry bubbles along.
