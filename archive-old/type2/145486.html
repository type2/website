Subject: Re: Electric Bay Window

Greg ( and all)

The problem with hydrogen (fuel cells and a like) was
included in the last line of your article:

&quot;&quot;&quot;Significant obstacles still exist for fuel cell
vehicles, especially the costs of the fuel cell stacks
and of producing and delivering hydrogen.&quot;&quot;&quot;

From what I understand hydrogen production involves
vast quantities of methane (natural gas) to produce on
an industrial level.  Natural gas is in more shortage
than  oil. (read &quot;Twilight in the Desert&quot; by Matt
Simmons)

With the coming &quot;oil crisis&quot; I am chosing electric for
several reasons&quot;

1.  My area has a adequate supply of electric
generating assets, i.e., Coal and hydro.  I know coal
is a problem for the enviroment but in the coming
chaos the environment is going to go out the window.

2.  Should the grid not be an option, I have a
mountain stream in my front yard which I plan to make
a mill pond and a mill race to convert gravity into
electricity.  Coupled with solar voltaics I might be
able to pull the green beast out of the garage and go
for a spin a couple day a week.

I think I'll convert one of my VW rabbit pickups
first.  They are lighter and have better wind
dynamics.  If I put my Coleman generator in the truck
bed I'll have a &quot;hybrid&quot;.
