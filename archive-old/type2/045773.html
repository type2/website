Subject: [T2] Poor College Student gets a Job

Hey listees,

    It's Yucel (aka the poor college student), and yes I have found a job.  
WOO-HOO, that means I can purchase more VW bus stuff, cool.  Well I need an 
Engine for my 73 bus if anyone out there has one let me know, okay dudes.

Peace in the middle east

Yucel

Ps.Just cause I found a job doesn't mean I'm not poor. a poor excuse, HA
