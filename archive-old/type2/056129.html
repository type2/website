Subject: RE: Key for engine hatch
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

&gt; When I bought my Westy two years ago it didn't come with the
&gt; engine hatch key.
&gt; How do I get the proper key cut for it?  Will VW have the code?

Remove the latch and take it to your nearest dealer. It has the code on it,
and most dealers will make a key from the code for about $5 to $7.
