Subject: Re: Ive got a '78 westy

&gt;[This came to the web site, has anybody got a spare 78 Westy Owner's
&gt;Manual? --KH]
&gt;
&gt;      which I've just bought.  I have no idea how to work the  gas 
heater
&gt;or the fridge.  Any ideas where I can get some  info?   Thanks Martin

I have a copy of the '78 Bus owner's manual on my web site at 
http://www.type2_dot_com/bartnik/myvan.htm

Click on the link for the '78 Bus owner's manual.  This will tell you 
how to operate the gas heater, anyway.  

The fridge operation would be covered in the Westfalia supplement to the 
owner's manual, which I unfortunately do not have on my site because my 
'78 was not a Westy, just a regular 7-passenger Bus.
