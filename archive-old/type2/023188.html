Subject: my own-- what is it?
Mime-Version: 1.0

so, going through my westy this weekend, i came upon some odd things.  i 
have no idea as to what they are for, but i believe they go together.  if i 
only had a digital camera i would have them on the web, but...here's my 
description.

1) a piece of white plastic about 2 1/2&quot; long that is round (like a pencil) 
but hollow inside.
it says, &quot;wind 8 times&quot; on it.

2) two black round pieces of plastic that fit together.  when i push them 
together and turn, they come apart and there is a red fuse on the inside of 
one piece.

sorry about the crappy description!  does anyone have any idea what i would 
&quot;wind eight times&quot; on my 75 westy?

thanks a bunch!
