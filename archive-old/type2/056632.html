Do you set them up so they blow down over the cooling fans?  Also, I
noticed that the higher I set my fridge, the more ice that formed, which
made it warmer inside, requiring me to turn it up more.  Moderation is the
key-if you have ice, you're insulating the interior from the cooling fins
and it won't get as cold as you would like.
