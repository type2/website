Subject: Re: [T2] 'Bump' starting

From: &quot;Sage Green&quot; &lt;honey_bus_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;
&gt; I have discovered that by pushing, or starting to coast on a slight grade,
I can easily catch my '78 FI stick Westy in gear and get it started that
way.  First gear or reverse.
&gt; When I had that idiosyncrasy in my '78, I would park where the bay could
be pushed, or coasted.

I'm well aquatinted with this method of starting. :O)

It's just that my drive way is inclined in the wrong direction, and that I
nearly had a heart attack trying to push the bus when we first got it!

I absolutely have to go out this evening, so pushing may be the route to go
until I can figure out and fix the problem.

Maybe that remote starter isn't such a bad idea, Richard...
