Subject: Re: [T2] lOOKING FOR A STOCK TACH OR CLOCK FOR A 70 TRANSPORTER

If they even made stock tachometers for buses, it's news to me. I'd love to 
have one that matches the stock equipment; right now I've got some 
aftermarket device that doesn't quite fit in, so sticks awkwardly out of the 
dash rather than being set in. Still, it works, so if you care more about 
having a tach than knowing what time it is, you can always settle for 
something that doesn't quite match, or fit, but does the job.
