Steve and others

I think you are taking to much of this on your own shoulders.  I think you are
doing a great job, both you and Ken and whoever else is behind the scenes.
You guys are doing a great service to all of us and I greatly appreciate it.
So if these things happen, and they will, I think all of us will have the
kindness in our heart to ignore it and understand what you guy have done for
us.

So please don't worry about it

Brent
