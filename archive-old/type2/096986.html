Subject: Re: [T2] Loose output shaft bearing- is it adjustable?

I went through the exact same thought process a few months ago, and almost
did what you're considering...don't do it!

My recent experience and past list advice seems to indicate that the &quot;loose
bearing&quot; is probably a worn differential cover.  This seems to cause the
play you described (left side only). It may cause the seal to wear out and
leak, but it has not caused me any tranny noise or trouble.  I've run for
12K+ miles, and judging by the sludge build-up on the tranny when I bought
it, it's probably been that way for a long time.

The plastic flange is a locking ring for the metal adjusting ring
underneath.  This adjuster is for the differential bearing, which is
probably not loose at all.  Adjusting the diff. bearing requires special
considerations (I think Bentley addresses this).  If you tighten these
bearings without doing the necessary measurements, it will probably destroy
them.  When I removed my adjusters to replace the seals, I just marked their
original position and put them back where I found them.  You should be able
to replace the seals (and O-rings) with the tranny in place.

Whenever my tranny does need a rebuild, I'm going to try to have a bushing
installed in the differential cover so this doesn't happen again.  I've also
been told that chrome (more wear resistant) diff. covers can be had.

Luck,
