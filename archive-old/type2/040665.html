Subject: Greetings from a newbie

   Hello all.  I am a new subscriber to this list, having just purchased my 
first type 2. I have had VWs for years, but until recently, a bus was just on 
the wish list.  
     I have a few questions if you don't mind. 
     First- Can anyone recommend a good mail order parts supplier?  Bus has 
very little rust, but needs lots of odds and ends. Which brings me to my 
other question. 
     Second - Bus is a '69 that originally had bench seats in the back. The 
PO was going to try making a camper out of it, so he tossed out the bench 
seats, along with all the hardware, and seat belts.  Thankfully, he didn't go 
any further, so I don't have holes drilled all over where they shouldn't be.  
Am I dreaming that I might be able to find some bench seats out there to put 
the inside back how it's supposed to be? I realize that shipping such an item 
would not be cheap, but right now my bug seats more than my bus!!
 Thanks for any help,
  Brian Zuhse
