Subject: RE: clutch adjustment

&gt;I had my clutch replaced a couple of years ago I have nothing like that
&gt;much wear after 20K. It would be worth checking the cable for wear which
&gt;to me seams guite likely. -

I don't think the problem with my clutch is necessarily wear, but a
stretched cable.  It has always been a little quick to engage, I am just
at the point whereit bugs me.  And, I wnat to look at the cable before
the really bad weather hits.  Thanks for the tips, I should look at it
htis weekend, maybe tomorrow if I'm lucky (unlucky?).
