&gt;Do I need an engine specific one, (I have a 72 westy with a 1700 pancake with
&gt;twin webers) or can I just go down to NAPA and pick up a &quot;electric fuel pump
&gt;for carburetor engines&quot;.  Recommendations?

There is one generic electric pump that everyone uses for carbed setups.
It makes a lot of noise and I wouldn't buy it.  Hook it up to 12v for a
second if in doubt.  Just make sure the pump doesn't put out more than 5
psi.  To be honest, I'd recommend you stick with the stock pump, which is
quiet, simple, and generally has a long service life.  Plus, it's cheap at
Bus Depot.
