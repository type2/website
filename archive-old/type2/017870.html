&gt; The one thing I have been realy dissatisfied with with our '71s is the
&gt; way they ride in the front.  Even with new shocks, the front ends are
&gt; definitely higher from the ground when viewed from the side than the
&gt; rear is.  When you try to use the rear view mirror, you can only see a
&gt; little ways behind you--it's like you are really tilted up and the
&gt; mirror is only giving you a view of one car behind you, not as much of
&gt; the road as it could, like other cars.
&gt; 
&gt; Would a mirror from another year bus (earlier or later) correct this
&gt; problem?  Or am I doomed to low visibility in the rear view mirror?  By
&gt; the way, our local parts guys think I am nuts when I mention this!

&gt; &gt; On my '78 Westy, I replaced my rear view mirror with a larger, early
&gt; &gt; model Vanagon rear view mirror. Now I can see out my right rear quarter
&gt; &gt; window (where the '73's cabinet is) without moving my head.  And I get a
&gt; &gt; better view on what's happening in the rear seat with my two kids.

Lealon:
68-69 mirrors mount lower and have a rubber buffer against the
windshield, maybe 2&quot; lower.
I've got a couple of NOS ones around somewhere.
I'd also agree that you need to have your rear torsion bars set up a
little.
