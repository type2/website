Subject: Re: [T2] Engine on the floor

&gt;Is there any reason I should not tip the engine on it's side to work on
&gt;it..I need to install a thermostat.

Won't hurt a thing. Work on top of a piece of plywood.

&gt;How about painting the cooling tin, an inexpensive spray can job, for
&gt;cosmetic reasons.  Would it burn off?

Use barbecue paint. Regular paint hasn't failed on me.
