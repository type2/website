Subject: Re: No Fire on #2 and #4?

 &gt;Martin: Re the vacuum leak possibility:  Help me out here. Would such
 &gt;a leak be consistent with a change on #1 and #3, but not on 2 and 4?

More than one vacuum leak? Have you tried spraying your flammable 
spray of choice around the inlet manifold? I have found the plastic 
straws that sprays like WD40 come with to be useful in directing the 
spray to where I want it. Leaks at the bottom edge of the manifold 
can be particularly hard to reach.

Martin.
