&gt; Hey everyone!
&gt; 
&gt; My throtle cable seems to be sticking a lot lately and I want to deal
&gt; with it once and for all.
&gt; 
&gt; I used a bit of grease on the cable where it comes out of the cooling
&gt; tin and that helped a bit, but not much. I really dont' think that is
&gt; where the problem lies, though. I think it's more to the front of the
&gt; bus.
&gt; 
&gt; Here's the deal:
&gt; 
&gt; ~'69 Westy with 30/31 carb
&gt; ~no recent work that would cause this
&gt; 
&gt; It's because of laziness (that and the fact I'm working 6 10 hour days
&gt; a week) that I turn to the list for such a BS fix. I don't wanna tear
&gt; into it and self-diagnose; I don't have the time!
&gt; 
&gt; I especially don't want to take the splash-plate off the front unless
&gt; I need to.
&gt; 
&gt; Tomorrow is my &quot;one&quot; day off this week and I'd like to fix it. Any
&gt; ideas to save me from wasting time on such a foolish (but dangerous)
&gt; problem?

Jaime:
I'd at least get down on the floor and see if the pedal is free first
before blaming the cable. The hinges get rusty and also the linkage
wears and binds up. I was able to buy a new bellcrank assembly soon
after I got my 69 (way back in the 80's), I doubt they are available
anymore. Taking the splash pan off is about the easiest thing you'll
ever do on a bus. Don't ever have to put it back on either- don't 
mis-lay the screws, though, if you don't put it back on right away!
