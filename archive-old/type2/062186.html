Subject: Re: flywheel inspection

I have this image in my mind of a flywheel turning in response to
combustion-inspired rotation...at about 3000 revolutions-per-minute...ahem-
50 times around each second...which, if this were the big hand on a clock,
would mean we'd be a year older in less than 3 minutes. Then, all of the
sudden, the damn thing busts into about 300 peices...don't ask me why!
Chunks go flying everywhere in response to this fantastic speed of rotation.
Schrapnel the size of road pebbles. Maybe a peice catches in the starter
bendix; chunks bounce around between the engine case and transmission. The
pressure plate frees itself and rattles around on the transmission shaft as
it slows. Nothing Muir ever wrote about describes this noise, so you sit on
the side of the road for two hours, just scratching your head.

Okay, so it's just a little after 4 am and I can't sleep. Maybe my
imagination's a little too active. Then again, maybe you could install the
flywheel and make history. ;) Joe


&gt;I have a flywheel with a bunch of short hairline cracks visible. The
&gt;cracks are no longer than a centimeter in length. They all extend
&gt;radially on the shiny portion of the flywheel. Should the flywheel be
&gt;replaced? Turned? Ignored? :)
