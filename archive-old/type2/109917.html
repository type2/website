Hey Den, you should look at my &quot;slam door&quot;  I took a nylon web strap and
made it into a loop, and put the two ends under what is left of the
handle,, using the stock 2 small bolts to hold it.

The kids can get their hand inside the loop like a ski pole, and &quot;giver&quot;
to get the door to SLAM!

Mind you, I have the door adjusted so it slides and catches very
easily,,,, but everyone seems to have to slam it!

&gt; I had that handle on my 77 bus too...it's supposed to be a closer helper

&gt;
&gt; Notice I said 'had'...the first time you pull on it to close the door,
&gt; it snaps off...one of the more useless items IMHO...if anyone has a
&gt; better idea here, I'd love to hear it...
