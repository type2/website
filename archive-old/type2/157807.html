Subject: Re: [T2] Winter Storage

&lt;&lt; I have limited time and funds at this point&gt;&gt;

Ken,
It sounds like you procrastinated on this job for awhile, and now your
backs to the wall.
A car cover will keep dust and dirt off of the primer , but will not in
any way prevent the car from getting wet.

The Primer is clay based product, and will absorb moisture even with a
car cover on it.( not unless you used a epoxy or polyurethane primer,
but as you mentioned your short on funds so I'm assuming you short
cutted the job and went the cheapest route )

So--here is your one option's for winter storage.

Rent a Storage area.
Buy a cheap blue platic tarp and cover it up.
Or--
Blow a coat of a wax based corrosion protectant over the whole car and
wait till spring again, and wash it off with mineral spirits, and start
on the job all over again.

3 or 4 cans should cover the Bus till spring.

The Rust Shield is $12.99 a can, plus tax.
The Blue tarp is about $15.00
The rent on a storage area is 80 bucks a month.

Good Luck,

            ______________
