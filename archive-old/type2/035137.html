Subject: And another question...

Howdy-
As I just posted, I towed the '72 I bought home yesterday, popped the top,
opened it all up, and found a little plaque that says Campmobile.  All this
time I thought it was a Westy.
Now, nobody ever told me it was and there is no identification saying it is,
but I just went on my happy little way thinking it was.
Mind you I am new to VW Campers, but not to VW's in general and especially
the type 4 motor,
and for me the whole reason I had to have this was I loved the interior
setup and practicality so there is no buyers remorse here.  The question is
where do I go to find info on a '72 Campmobile?  I've found lots of sites re
the Westy but not the Campmobile.  Can you call them a Campy?
In any case any and all responses will be greatly appreciated, and thanks
for the kind response regarding the CC excel I offered!


Thanks!
