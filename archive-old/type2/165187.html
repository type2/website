&gt;   What luck have most had getting seats out of another vehicle?
&gt;
&gt;   What would be good ones to look for?

Pretty much anything will require bolting or welding new rails on.
They're not like the late bays that take Vanagon seats.

But you could rebuild your seats with hair pads and covers from
Wolfsburg West. Those seats are actually pretty darn comfy when the
CORRECT hair padding is in place.

(Avoid the TMI foam pads. They're a joke. I tried them...)
