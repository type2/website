Hi, 

Two things spring to mind. First, are the float valves working OK. Second
did you get a fuel pump which delivers too much pressure? When I fitted an
electric pump, it was from a scrapyard and the flow rate was somewhat
greater than the mechanical pump, and my carbs leaked but they were ok when
I adjusted the floats and valves. If you picked up a FI pump that would be
way too much pressure I'm told.
