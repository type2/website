Subject: Re: [T2] Handbrake Adjustment Tool

Shawn,
I know that it isn't right to answer a question with a
question, but I noticed last weekend that my hand
brake is not working so well.  I haven't had time to
look into it, but I was hoping that a simple
adjustment would solve my problem.  Where is the
adjustment you are asking about?  I will be curious to
see the responses you get to your post as it looks
like something I will be wanting to try.  Good luck!

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm having trouble twisting my handbrake adjustment
&gt; nut as tight as it
&gt; needs to be.  I am trying to use needle nose pliers
&gt; while holding the screw
&gt; with a screwdriver.  Is there a better tool to use
&gt; for this?  If so, which?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Shawn.
