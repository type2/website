Subject: Buses by the Bridge NEWS FLASH 

   Buses by the Bridge now has the possibility to be extended one day.
Looking at the 2002 calendar it turns out that January 21, 2002 is Martin
Luther King day, which is a holiday. So those of you that were worried about
getting back home should not worry as it IS a Federal Holiday. 

Ronnie
Buses by the Bridge VI, January 18,19 and 20 (and possibly 21) 2002
Lake Havasu, AZ. where the sun always shines
