Subject: Only 17 days 'till 3rd Annual Buses by the Beach Bus BRR!
  February 10-11, Pokagon State Park, Angola, Indiana!

Got Buses on the brain!

It's 26 degrees outside right now, snow is forecast for the next 10 days and
I can't stop thinking of sleeping in a bus and hanging out with cool bus
volk for the first time this year.

17 days 'till Bus BRR! at Pokagon State Park in Angola, Indiana!

Here are some details with camping and tobogganing costs below:


*Gate entry:  $5.00 Entry at Gate*

*Campsite with electric hookup:  $11.00 (We will again be at Campground #3)*

*Sunday Brunch at Pottawatomie Inn:  $12.95 per person*

*Being with friends around a campfire again:  Priceless!*


*3rd annual Buses by the Beach Bus BRR* at beautiful Pokagon State Park (
www.in_dot_gov/dnr/*park*lake/
*park*s/*pokagon*.html&lt;http://www.in_dot_gov/dnr/parklake/parks/pokagon.html&gt;
) in Angola, Indiana!   Go to the Buses by the Beach website (
www.busesbythebeach_dot_com) and click on &quot;Events&quot; to see the 2007 Bus BRR flyer
and cool pics from previous years.



The fun starts this year at around 1:00 pm on Saturday, February 10th.  We
will have a big pile of firewood (please don't bring your own  Emerald Ash
Borer problems!) and start the crock pot chili (electric hook ups on each
campsite) when the buses are leveled, tops are popped and heaters are
started.   Then, it's off to the wild toboggan run for some 35-40 mph runs
on the refrigerated tracks.  Back to campsite later on for all different
kinds of chili, music and great bus talk around the big fire.   Make sure to
include the fantastic brunch at the rustic Pottawatomie Inn on your calendar
for the next day, Sunday February 11 th, before hitting the road.



The famous, fashionable and warm Buses by the Beach Bus BRR
hoodie sweatshirts will be available again for sale.  (See Brien Dews)

*All* proceeds once again benefit the Phoenix Society for Burn Survivors.  (
www.*phoenix*-*society*_dot_org &lt;http://www.phoenix-society_dot_org/&gt;)

Last year, the snow started about 2:00 pm and continued until about 10:00 at
night.  As we stood around the campfire catching up with old bus friends and
making new ones, the clouds cleared out and the almost full moon sparkled on
the new snow.   It was a great sight to walk up the hill, look down and see
all the cool buses huddled together in the moonlight with happy bus volk
around the fire.  Most campers lined their poptops with Mylar sheets before
bed and ran small electric heaters or kept the top down.   We were toasty
warm despite the 24 degree low that night.  Brilliant sunshine greeted us
the next morning as everyone contributed something to a community breakfast
around the fire.

Please feel free to email me with any questions or call my cell phone at
(574) 286-0848.    Can't wait to see you there!
