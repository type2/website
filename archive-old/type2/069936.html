&gt; ...on a spur-of the moment trip.  I'm headed from Rochester, NY to 
&gt; Edinburg, NY (near lake george) to NYC to Boston and then back to 
&gt; Rochester.  Keep an eye out for an orange bus with a &quot;mean people suck&quot; 
&gt; sticker on the back...that'll be me.
&gt; 
&gt; Wish me luck, and have a good weekend everyone!

Yow!  A &quot;Mean People Suck&quot; sticker!  I don't have one of those for my
disguise-a-bus collection yet--nor one of its hilarious [but perhaps too
naughty for mention, even on a Friday] sequels, which I've also seen
around town. 

Have a good trip, Tom--and meanwhile, list members, what other bus-for-
all-seasons window stickers should we be collecting, to keep all the bases
covered? [I gather there are no stickers yet for
type-2_at_lists.primenet_dot_com?]

curiously,
