Hello list members.....

Well, after 4 months of constant use, Jasper broke down on me and left me 
stranded. I was coming down Steiner in downtown SF (that famous road with 
the pastel houses on it, with the city in the background) and when I came to 
the bottom of the hill, I had downshifted into first and realized it was not 
coming out of first. Try as I might, she was not going to let me shift into 
any other gear. I coasted up the road in first long enough to pull her out 
of the way of traffic, and turned it off. I could get it out of first 
finally, so I started it back up thinking it was a fluke when I realized I 
could not engage any gears when it was running, and my clutch pedal sunk to 
the floor rather easily. uh oh. It is a Sunday, I do not have AAA (note to 
self, get AAA) so I called around, and around, and around. Towing quotes 
started at $185, and I finally gave in to the fourth place that was open 
Sundays and paid the $90 to get it back over to Yerba Buena Island. (half 
way across the bay bridge) I was not sure if this was something my regular 
mechanic would want to tackle, so getting her home for now was the best idea 
I had.

In the 11 vehicles I have owned, I have never had to have anything with the 
tranny or clutch worked on, having that said im guessing it is the clutch 
that went out on me, or something that makes the clutch work, snapped, 
broke, or came way too loose to work anymore. I pulled out the Bentley last 
night to get an idea of how big of a project this is, and finally came to 
the 'step one - remove the engine' part. That scares me, as I do not have 
the bread for a big project right now, but have made this van my daily 
driver, so I also do not have a lot of options if it is.

Any suggestions, humor, or comments are appreciated.

Christopher
