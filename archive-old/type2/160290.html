Subject: [T2]76 Brakes (update) HeLP~!~

well i got the other master cylinder on there and primed it before putting on there...
   
  problem is now i cant get any fluid out to the back tires at all....???/
   
  so i am down until i can get this resolved....
   
  how can i tell if there is a way if the mc is bad before putting it on....?
  i can get fluid with no problem pumping fine for front brakes but the backs are nothing but air no fluid at all and thats after 10 pumps each and around the bus for a another 10 pumps per wheel...
   i dont see any leaks from anywhere....
  this really sucks....
   
  i really wished i could get my brake problems solved....
   
  i have no brake pedal at all now.... at all....~!~ at least on the other mc i had three or four pumps and could stop on this new one i cant get any stopping at all... course like i said if i could bleed the backs somehow... and gravity bleeding aint working there either....
   
  somethig aint right here at all.... i dont knwo what it is but somehting aint right...
   
  any help here is much appreciated.... 
   
  i cant do this again next week this makes three weeks monday i been dealing with this.....
   surely the new mc from advance isnt bad also....
   
  once again can you tell from the mc being out if its good or not...? is thee a way...?
   
  looks like i will miss thew campout this weekend now i had hoped such for ....
  and oyhh yeah getting dropped off and picked up from work again today that really sucks big toime and puts me in a bigger bind getting my little girl picked up etc.....
