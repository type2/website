Subject: RE: [T2] Road cow gives birth!

&gt;It was just sitting out in the rain with the windows rolled down. It had 
&gt;an out of date AZ plate but I didn't take a closer look.

There is a salvageable '78 Westy locally sitting outside with the sliding 
door off. Sure wish somebody would rescue it before the floors rot out. It 
was for sale a couple months ago but the owner gave up.

Me? Don't have the excess $$$.
