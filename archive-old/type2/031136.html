&gt; 	WHY rebuild? Lack of power? A rebuilt VW can be considered
&gt; 'as new' if you do the whole Magilla, or something between new and
&gt; used if you economize. I'm not sure $900 is enough budget for a
&gt; type IV once you start. 

I just did (mostly) the whole Magilla and it was just a bit over $2,000

had a machine shop with VW experience do the long block then I finished
I mostly watched and even helped while the shop worked on it.  had the
crank turned and balanced, balanced the connecting rods, new Mahle P&amp;C,
new rings, 1gram balanced the whole bottom end, assembled.
new oil pump, honed in
head cleaned and checked, new exhaust valves, new springs, honed but not
polished the intake ports.  valves were 3 angle seated, and lapped in. new
valve seats, peened in place
all new bearings throughout
all new seals, new torque converter (not included in price)

old stuff.
fuel injection system (it was working well)
intake manifolds
exhaust
tin (cleaned and repainted)

runs very smooth, oil presure idles at 25-35 never falls below 55psi at
any temp or speed, even breaking it in on 100 degree days it never got
above 240 degrees, usually runs at about 200 or so.

new engine comp seal too!

&gt; Obvious things to price out are 
&gt; 
&gt; pistons and cylinders, 
&gt; rebuilt heads, 
&gt; new bearings for crank and rods, 
&gt; new clutch (as long as you've taken it apart)
&gt; new oil pump
&gt; new seals, gaskets
&gt; new cam followers
&gt; exhaust studs, head studs, and other hardware
&gt; 
&gt; After which its a new engine. 
&gt; 
&gt; a CHEAP rebuild would be new pistons and cylinders, valve work
&gt; if necceary, leave the case halves bolted together. I've helped do
&gt; one, and it worked because the problem was bad rings.

I have also done these with ok results, and gotten 25,000 or more reliable
miles out of a 125k engine.
