Subject: Re: [T2] Fw: (T2) C/V's

&gt; &gt; Here's a question though, with the new CV's (Lobro) how tight should
&gt; &gt; they be? Of the 4, two are that tight I cannot move the inner race
&gt; &gt; relative to the outer race at all by hand. The other two move quite
&gt; &gt; easily, but without any 'play'. Is that normal?
&gt;
&gt; Not normal. The two tighter cv joints will destroy
&gt; themselves if you run them very far.
&gt; Disassemble them and turn the races one ball in either
&gt; direction and reassemble, the flex will return to normal.

Not normal for used CVs but ne ones can be so tight you can hardly move
them. That IS normal.
