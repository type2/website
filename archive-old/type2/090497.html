Thanks Michael, 
  No, I haven't found one, but what I have is the stove and sink combo the full width of the bus. SO-69. While I have you could you check one thing for me over there? The land rover dormobile pop tops are they the same window seals and vent seals? I really could use new replacements, and having a little difficulty locating seals in the States. 
Thanks again, 
Paul

seat ?
