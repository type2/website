Subject: Thanks to the list and Phil

Thanks to the list for helping me!  I needed an oil filler tube for my engine 
and couldn't find one anywhere.  Bus depot said they weren't available and I 
had called to many junkyards to count. I cant tell you how many bus's I also 
looked thru trying to find that *amn tube!  Well, Phil had one in CA and I am 
in Fla. and he sent it too me for FREE!  Thank you Phil so much, this list is 
really great!  I cant believe how it works so well!  
So in the spirit of Xmas how about .....I have a 73 bus i use for parts, it 
has a 1600 in it  but if anyone needs something let me know:)  BTW  bus boys 
has the tube if any one needs it , they also answered my query and told me it 
was a stock item.
