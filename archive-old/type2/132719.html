Three. First, find a source of baltic birch plywood and work with that, 
only.

Second, use biscuit joints instead of the dado and staple joints in the 
original. Much easier and, with good waterproof glue, stronger.

Third, if you want to have the coolest camper on the block, think about 
styling the kitchen cabinetry after an AGA stove. Do a google search on 
AGA ranges. The doors would have to be carved from hardwood. You will 
want to finish it with a good paint job.
