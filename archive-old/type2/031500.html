&gt;    I Just purchased a VW 1971 Campmobile. Only one problem, no keys. Anyone 
&gt; know how I could possibly get the thing started so I could get it home? From 
&gt; there I could put in a new ignition switch or have a key tumbled for it.

starting it, if it will start is easy, it is the locking steering that is
a problem.....personally I would trailer it anyway...don't know the
condiition of the fuel lines, brakes, etc etc etc
