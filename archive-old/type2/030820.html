Well, I just did a trial run for the main cooler body. I clipped the sides
of the outlet port off and bent the tops at 90 degree angles. I rolled
down the passengers window of the 411 (i figure if it can cool that, I can
rig it for the bus with ease), put the big old duct in with the door open,
rolled the window closed, shut the door with some of the bent top stuck
between the door frame and door (which held it rather nicely) and took
off.

And it worked, even at 60mph. Kinda. Sorta. (At least it didn't rip out of
the window.)

It doesn't do squat for the front seats but damn the back seat was nice
and cool. Apparently the airflow is pointing to the back seats. Argh.
So... it's off to the junkyard to find some directional airvents that I
can cannibalize.

On the style scale it actually doesn't look bad. Ok, yes, right now, it
looks like I have a big ugly peice of duct work attached to the car.  I'd
say when I get it all done and painted and primered it will look better
than the standard repro swamp coolers though.
