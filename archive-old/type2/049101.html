Subject: Re: [T2] Pedal sucked to the floor

That really is weird.  I just happened to be reading this same howstuffworks
article when this message came through on the list.  I am looking at the
cool interactive booster diagram at
http://www.howstuffworks_dot_com/power-brake1.htm

There is a vacuum diaphragm inside the booster and when your foot is off the
brake both sides of the diaphragm have engine vacuum applied so they are at
equal pressure.  When you apply the brakes you allow atmospheric pressure to
enter on one side of the diaphragm.  Now you have unequal pressures on the
diaphragm so the atmospheric pressure side wins over the vacuum side and you
get some help pushing on the brakes from the atmosphere.

Now, the real question is, you have atmospheric pressure on the one side of
the diaphragm and vacuum on the other.  What's to keep the diaphragm from
being forced to the extreme of its travel by the atmospheric pressure and
doing what we are seeing (i.e. sucking the brake pedal to the floor and
locking the brakes)?  Well it would seem there is a very large spring inside
the booster whose job it is to push back somewhat against the diaphragm and
the atmospheric pressure so it nicely balances the force from the
atmospheric pressure.  Naturally it does not completely balance the force
out or else there would be no point in having the booster but it keeps the
application of the brake in your control and not the booster's.

So it would seem to me that this spring is broken or out of whack.  That's
the only thing I can think of that makes sense though it may not necessarily
be the right answer :-)

If the diaphragm were ruptured, then we would just see equal pressures on
both sides of the diaphragm.  What would happen is that when you hit the
brake you would create a huge vacuum leak (as air at atmospheric pressure
rushes in to fill the vacuum) and probably the engine would die.  However
with your foot off the brake air at atmospheric pressure cannot enter the
booster and all is well.

If the check valve were not working (i.e. allowing air to pass in both
directions) then it probably wouldn't be that noticeable until you tried to
brake with the engine off only to find you don't have that one or two pedal
pump vacuum reserve that the check valve allows.  But as long as the engine
is running a vacuum is still being created, check valve or not.  Now if you
have a backfire and a bad check valve you risk blowing out the booster
diaphragm or causing other damage.

If the check valve is installed backwards so that air can only flow INTO the
booster, then the symptom there seems like it would just be no power assist
since a vacuum would not be present on one side of the booster diaphragm.

The only other issue is the vacuum supply.  The brake booster normally uses
manifold vacuum, that is vacuum from below the throttle plate.  This means
with the throttle plate closed (i.e. engine idle) the most vacuum is
developed and with the throttle plate open (full throttle) the least vacuum
is developed.  This makes sense because you want the most brake assist at
low or no throttle opening, since typically you are not trying to stop your
car with your foot firmly holding the gas pedal at wide open throttle.

So what then if you hooked the booster up to ported vacuum, or vacuum above
the throttle plate?  Then you would see the opposite, from relatively low
vacuum at idle to relatively high vacuum at high engine speed.  It seems
though that this wouldn't explain it either.  At idle speed you would have
LESS brake assist, not more (i.e. not enough to suck the pedal to the
floor).  At high engine speed you would have more brake assist than at idle
but since the booster is already designed to operate normally with high
vacuum at idle (manifold vacuum, remember) it doesn't seem like this would
explain it, even with a high idle speed.

The only thing I can come up with is the damn spring inside the booster that
is supposed to counterbalance the atmospheric pressure.  Seems like it might
be time to try a booster swap.  The other possibility that was already
mentioned was the overly high vacuum but I would think it would have to be
pretty darn high over stock.  You have a Weber so we know it's not stock but
is the engine size stock?  Did you put on a vacuum pump? :-)
Put a vacuum gauge on that sucker and see what you've got.

Or you can call it &quot;Brake Assist&quot; as they do on the new Mercedes-Benzes and
tell all your friends you have the latest accident-avoidance technology.

Anyone reading this who knows better please point out any errors in my
reasoning.  I like trying to think these things through but I usually get
myself in trouble that way :-)

                            --The Black Crowes


&gt; I
&gt; &gt; have a single progressive Weber with a vacuum port in the manifold, but
when
&gt; &gt; I connect the booster it sucks the brake pedal to the floor and jams on
all
&gt; &gt; the brakes.  Anyone got a clue what's causing this and how to remedy it?

&gt;
&gt; I can't think of how this could be possible without there being either an
overly high vacuum on the port (is the engine stock?) or a malfunction in
the booster somewhere that has reduced the pressure necessary to apply the
brakes (?). I can't see the master cylinder being the issue because your
symptoms indicate a working master (the brakes lock up).
