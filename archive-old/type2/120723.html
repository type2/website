Subject: Re: [T2] Optima charging requirements

Boy Phil, this discussion really got off on some wild frenzy--

Yes, your alternator will chage an Optima Battery--

And I don't care what kind of regulator you have in your Bus--Bosch,
Delco, Motorcraft, Nipondenso, Wells, Standard, Niehoff, or whatever.

The parameter's for charging a yellow top battery are thus;
 13.8  to 15.0 volts --to get 90% full charge _at_ 50 amps will take the
alternator 112 minutes.

If you had a cranked up alternator--like 100 amps it would take 52
minutes.

Don't let these bench racer's scare you.
The Optima battery is a fine unit and will function in any vehicle you
put it in--as long as it has some sort of DC power supply--putting out
some sort of amperage.

The battery is just a storage unit--regardless what type it is--


The bench racer's went off on some sort of wild tangent here on this
subject--

I have seen them in 50 and 60's Farmall tractor's and thay perform well
for year's, without any or little maintenece.

And I do know the wire's and all the electrical connection's are a bit
fuzzy in these unit's--

Fear not--It's a great battery--and will work just fine in your vehicle.

 
E-mail message   
 
Could someone comment as to the correctness of my understanding of the
discussion on regulators?: 
1. The original Bosch voltage regulator and generator in my 70 bus will
not provide the proper charging required to properly maintain an
Optima/dry cell battery. 
2. A solid state regulator will allow an alternator equipped bus (72 and
later) to properly charge a dry cell/Optima. 
3. A solid state regulator cannot be used with a generator to properly
charge an Optima. 
Phil
