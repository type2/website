hi

I have just got back from my long weekend camping trip in my 
1975 camper.  I have had my van since November and have been  
camping at least once a month in her so far, and this was 
the first trip when it did not snow!!  I will have to sort 
out a heater for next winter but right now i am trying to 
prepare for the opposite problem.

It was too hot in the morning when the sun came up, and this 
was only England in April, as  I am camping in  Italy for a 
couple of months in the Summer I am trying to prepare for 
this now.  I figure i could do with a side tent, any leads 
as to where to get one in the UK?  I have seen some 
advertised that are the modern style - like the ones you see 
attached to caravans - but i would prefere one that was more 
in keeping with the style of my van, which is quite an 
authentic looking '75.  Any ideas appreciated.  If i cannot 
buy one any leads on a pattern to try and make one?

But the other problem i am anticipating in Italy is the need 
for mosquito netting over the skylight, the sliding window, 
and perhaps over the sliding door (if i cannot find a side 
tent).   Has anyone tried to make their own mosquito 
netting, or can you buy it to fit our vans?

I anyone has advance warning of other &quot;summer camping in 
vans&quot; problems that you think i may run into I would 
appreciate any tips.  

The british weather is so odd i can not believe that last 
month when i was camping i had to wear 5 pairs of socks at 
all times and scrape the ice of the windows and 4 weeks 
later the roof is up (for the first time)  and we are 
moaning about being sweaty.  Oh the joys of camping.

thanks for any advice / leads

helen
