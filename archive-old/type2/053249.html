Subject: Door Locks Question

I'\'ve been fooling with my door locks, I've tried different ways, and it 
appears that there is a quirk whit this that I want to know if all are this 
way or if maybe I'm having a problem. Here's the deal.
I can lock the doors one of two ways. I can pull the lever out on the inside 
of the door before I shut it, and this locks it. I can also shut the door, 
insert the key, turn it left, and the door is locked. I can insert the key 
turn it right, and unlock the door. Cool so far. My concern is that if I try 
and open the door without having first unlocked it, it somehow gets to where 
the key won't work. I don' t worry too much about forgetting I've got the 
doors locked, certainly not both front doors, but I worry about someone 
trying to open doors while I'm away, then me being locked out of my own bus. 
I guess I should mention that we have a '70 Dormobile Camper.
