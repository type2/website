Subject: Re:engine wiring - 76 

I'd guess that it is the interface for a diagnostic checkout system (test 
network) that VW dealers used back in the years your vehicle was current. 
Big computer was plugged into the engine at those connectors and multiple 
readouts were suppose to send the mechanic to trouble spots. Most dealers 
stopped using them, and few mechanics had much skill or luck working with them.

Hello,
I have a 76 bus, and found a disconnected wire in the engine compartment
recently. It looks to be nearly round, with three female connections
within. It is over by the battery, like it is coming from the factory
wiring harness..
Thoughts, suggestions....... ?
