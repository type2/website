Subject: Re: [T2] A possible solution to leaky S-Boots?

I LIKE it! Hopefully you put on enough coats that even
if it doesn't bond with the hose, the coating will
remain intact and perform as an outer skin!

I have read, in this list, several references to
&quot;intake gaskets&quot; in the past couple weeks. I decided
if I kept quiet that I would eventually get enough
clues to figure out what they're referring to. Okay,
this is it! WHAT do you mean by &quot;intake gaskets?&quot; The
only possible thing I can think of is the gaskets at
the phenolic spacers at the bottom of the intake
runners and injector blocks where it attaches to the
heads. I have never, ever had a leak there and can't
imagine anybody would. Only other things could be the
hoses that attach the plenum and runners or the
throttle body-to-plenum (I've had problems with this.)
The hoses connecting the plenum to the runners mostly
self-seal except when they've gotten hard and started
to flare out at the ends.

So what are intake gaskets? -BaH

{I like the back seat / bed project also}

 I used plasti dip to seal it. So far it's working
 awesome!
