Subject: Vacuum sound

 I don't have another one to listen to so, With the hatch to the engine
compartment open should I hear the air going through the air
distribution box? Had a severe vacuum leak that I fixed but I still hear
the hissing sound. Can't seem to pin it down. Plugged all vacuum ports
to rule out the hoses, still hear it. SHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSH.

The Turtlebus lives again. Oil Pressures acceptable and temps are lower!
