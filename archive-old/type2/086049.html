Subject: Re: [T2] ??? Mystery Distributor



&gt;
&gt;So I guess it disappeared wrapped in the Bug huh?  Did you ever have any
&gt;clues to how or who?  Sorry about your loss!
&gt;
&gt;Bob


My long, short story:  I sold the '70 Bug to my Dad's then, current 
girlfriend(I know, BIG mistake) and I was coerced into leaving the dizzy and 
electronic ignition on the vehicle.  I was given assurances that I would be 
allowed to retrieve the parts from the vehicle when I had the time to do so. 
  Needless to say, she disappeared as soon as her and my Father parted ways. 
  So did my distributor.  :^(  Thank you for the sympathy.

	Eron
