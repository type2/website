&gt; was it a good year for the beetle motor??? 

Hello Jim   Well you got some answers to freeing it up but not to this ??  Is 
it a H block which is what was in a 68 bug then the motor had some problems  
weak alloy in the block wouls cause   these cases to crack and pull the heads 
studs easier than later cases. Check the oil pump studs if they are 8mm using 
13 mm nuts then they are the bad cases, if they are 6mm using 10mm nuts then 
it is a 67 and is a little better.  they can be rebuilt but usally require 
lineboring and case savers for the head studs. Personally I would find a 72 and 
later case to use  later ans have fun  Mark Dearing  salem Import Service  Salem
