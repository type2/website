&gt; 
&gt; Are these bias ply tires?  Radial tires usually do not have a ply
rate, but a
&gt; load rating.

Radial tires list number of plys, ply rating, load range, and load
rating.  The only number that really means anything is the load rating
in pounds.  Load range (&quot;Standard&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, or &quot;D&quot;) is very deceptive as
tha actual load-carrying capacity of a load range varies widely with
tire size.  A load-range C tire in 195/75R14 has much less
load-carrying capacity than a standard load tire in 185R14.

The Korean tires I've run have been adequate in quality.  No
catastrophic failures, unlike a (supposedly high quality) European
brand.
