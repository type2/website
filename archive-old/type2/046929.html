Subject: Re: [T2] F.I Feul pump.

&gt; I assume since my 79' westy has a weber carb, that the
&gt; feul pump was changed also in the prcess. so will I
&gt; have to find a factory feul pump, when I switch back
&gt; to F.I.?

Yes, and they're about $200.00. I purchased a used FI last year. Apart from
the fact that the Weber runs pretty good, this has been the main reason for
not converting.
