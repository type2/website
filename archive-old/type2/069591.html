Subject: 67 double cab steering LOOSE!

I just purchased a 67 double cab, the truck is scruffy, but will be a =
great work vehicle.  The problem is, the steering is really sloppy, like =
1/2 turn before anything happens.  The relay arm is very loose in its =
mount.  How is something like this repaired?
