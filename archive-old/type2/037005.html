Subject: Re: Watch Out for Cheap Paint Jobs!!!  (was Paint Jobs)

&gt; A cheap paint job is worse than no paint job.  You will have to redo
&gt;it, probably soon.

I agree with most of the sentiment in this letter, but...

My bus was bought with an 11-year old Paint-n-Bake (cheap local place)
cheapie job on it.  The owner had it done when he bought the bus in '85.
Amazingly, this paint is still adhered (for the most part) to the surface of
my bus.  And although the color is wrong (white instead of Ivory), the
poptop was painted(THAT'S coming off in large chunks), and the surface is
rusty in places (was probably before the paint job as well), I'll have to
say that I'm impressed.  For $100 I would've expected a lot worse for a
15-yr-old paint job.

And my bus will never win any beauty contests, anyhow.
