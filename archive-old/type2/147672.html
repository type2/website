Subject: Re: Hello and auto trans question

Thanks all for the help.  With the information given, I was able to
fabricate a lever (yeah, it was gone), and a rod to operate things.  Now the
tranny seems to be shifting correctly.  We will work on the timing and
kickdown a bit more later.  As it is, I am tired and going to bed.

&gt;  Hello,
&gt;
&gt; A friend just bought a 1980 Westy which I am helping him fix, and I am now
&gt; looking for a Westy myself (way too cool).  I have been searching the
&gt; archives for information on transmission kickdown issues, and a seeming
&gt; slip/slide into third.  I am hoping to gain information and assistance into
&gt; the workings of the auto trans in this van.  The real question is, what is
&gt; the kickdown switch, how is it adjusted, and are replacements available?
&gt; This Westy was converted from FI to carb, and I do not see a switch
&gt; anywhere.  I had one place tell me it is manual, the throttle cable goes to
&gt; the trans, then a rod goes to the throttle body, but that doesn't match
what
&gt; I think I found in the archives.  Help please?
