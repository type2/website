&gt; Recently it has become very bouncy in the front while I am on the road.  It
&gt; doesn't seem to do this when I'm at higher speeds but more likely when I am
&gt; going at the speed of 15 to 30 mph.  I know that this doesn't tell you much
&gt; but does anyone have any ideas?  

STOP DRIVING, check your tires REAL good for a possible bubble in the
tread.  also check the weight rating of the tires.   I had this happen and
it was just before a front tire disintegrated.

also check that the lug nuts are tight, it also could be worn shocks.
