&gt;In planning a summer road trip from Austin, TX to Tempe, AZ, I solicit
&gt;advice from the list.  I have a perfectly running recently rebuilt 1600
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;Does anyone having experience with driving I10 through NM and AZ 
&gt;have something that I should know (like is it better to drive at night)?  

A good general rule of thumb is:  If you've got the windows open and you're
still sweating your ass off then so is your engine.  I drove my 73 Westy
(type IV motor) from San Antonio through Amarillo, Albuquerque, and Phoenix
on my way to Jerome last year in September.  And it was HOT!  I made a point
to always be on the road very early in the morning and make my best time
(4200 - 4400 RPM) before it got too hot outside.  Then around lunch time
when the temps were in the upper 90's - low 100's, I'd back off the pedal
and drop down below the 4K mark.  

I also made it a point to stop at the 'scenic overviews', visitors bureaus,
parks, etc. along the way (especially if they had AIR CONDITIONED visitor
centers!!).  Even took some additional backroads just to see more of this
beautiful country we live in.  Driving I-10 or I-40 in a bus sucks.  Spend
plenty of time studying a map and try to find routes that get you off the
interstate.  Your trip takes longer, but you'll enjoy it more and see some
things that the 80mph croud never will.

&gt;Would it be necessary to get a temperature gauge?  

Know your bus, man!  A temp gauge is a great tool to keep an eye on the
ever-changing temps of the life-preserving fluid of you beloved bus.  But
the same can be achieved by pulling over about once an hour (hey, your butt
will thank you too) and popping open the engine lid to check things out.
Feel the heat with your hand, eye-ball everything, take a wiz, grab a cold
drink, stretch you legs, check your oil level after it sits for a few
minutes and your on your way again.

&gt;Is a rich mixture a good way to keep it cool?  

Interesting question about the mixture.  I purposesly jetted my dual Weber
carbs a little richer for the trip.  Cost me about 1 mile to the gallon, but
I felt like the SLIGHTLY richer mixture would allow the heads to run a
little cooler.  Maybe a good idea, maybe a waste of gas money.  But it gave
me piece of mind and I didn't have any troubles.

Good luck and enjoy the trip!!  If you want any route-suggestions for the
trip, let me know off-list and I'll tell you where/how I went.
