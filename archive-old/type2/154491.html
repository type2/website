Subject: Correct Voltage regulator for 1972 bus

Hello


It seems that there are many voltage regulators offered for 1972 bus's at
parts stores, autozone will sell you a voltage regulator for a generators,
napa sells one with a lead and one screw.   CIP1 looks like the right one is
that right?
http://www2.cip1_dot_com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=BOS%2D0%2D190%2D600%2D016

Can anyone help me identify the correct part number?

Thanks in advance
Eric
