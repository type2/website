Subject: Question on exaust in cab.

Hiya all,
I thought I posted this over the weekend, but since I have yet to get a
response, I will re-post in hopes of a response. I have a '74 
bus. When I used the heat for the first time I was getting a faint
smell of exaust fumes. We took a small trip (~40 miles) and I was
only able to use the heater for a little bit due to the fumes.

I have a new engine seal and decklid seal. Is there anyway to
test the heat exchangers to see if it is they that are the culprits?

If it is one of the heat exchangers, and not the other, I am going to try
to route both hoses from my fresh air blower down the good side.
I realize that I will have even less heat, but new heat exchangers
are ~$350. OUCH!!! I could almost buy a Propex for that. So anyway,
I am looking for ideas and/or suggestions. Thanks.....
