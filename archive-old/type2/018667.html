Greetings all,

Looks like I'll be leaving humid Houston, TX for Lincoln sometime this
week.  I'll either be going up via US 59 and US 71 (the
Arkansas-Missouri route) or via I35 (through Oklahoma and Kansas). 
Passengers include myself, my brother, and one rather large cat. 
Although I plan on camping our way up there, if anyone has a driveway or
street curb they want to lend for a night, I'd love to hear from you. 
And I'll even show ya what I did with my newly refurbished interior. 
And buy ya a beer.  Whatever.  Let me know if you're along the way, I'd
like to meet some of you.

Jarrett
