Subject: Re: [T2] stainless??

&gt; Mine in my stock 78 do *not* look stainless at all.  They look rusty and
&gt; my crossover pipe has a small hole in it.  There are a couple of places
&gt; where my exhaust mainfolds look as if they may have been rewelded
&gt; slightly.

Looks are deceiving.
The tin heat shield will rust. The crossover will rust.
The exhaust pipes will not. But the flanges on the ends will.
Get a magnet and check the 2 exhaust pipes coming off the heads and going to the
U pipes.
And the U pipes are stainless also. They have a tin shield on them also that
will rust.
