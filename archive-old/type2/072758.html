I have an after market exhaust so I couldn't hook it up by the cross over
pipe because I don't have one.  Instead I took a 18 mm spark plug anti foul
and sawed off the bottom and welded the female end to the driver's side
exhaust manafold to heat exchanger elbow.  It only reads off one head but
should be accurate enough to gauge what the approx mixture is.

The In Dash fuel mixture monitor article is an interesting idea.  It could
save many a type 2 operator from dropped valve seats.

Have fun
