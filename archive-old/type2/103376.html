Subject: Re: [T2] strange thing by my front wheel

You need the condenser, the evaporator, the dryer, the hoses, the fans for 
moving the air around inside the van, fans for the outside of the van, 
compressor, bracket, pulley, belt, etc.

Your best bet is to locate a complete system and remove it yourself so that 
you see what is included, where it goes, and what it looks like.

They can be had for $100 if you are lucky.
