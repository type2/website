Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Seat Covers - '72

Barry,
If you working on a bay ( 72 right?) try and find some foam from a Vanagon. It
is wider that than any bay foam and the thickness would be just right. I
remember my grandparents replacing some foam bedding in their full size RV and
it was real expensive. I thnk they even drove the NJ from CT to find someone who
had the right stuff.

&gt; &gt; &gt; But first, I am going to try to fabricate a set
&gt; &gt; &gt; of 'pull over' seat covers.
&gt; &gt; &gt; (The rear seat(s) will be a snap to make since
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have been practicing my
&gt; &gt; &gt; sewing .)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I would think learing to sewing and sewing is
&gt; &gt;much more difficult than learning to use hog
&gt; &gt;rings and applying them.  Sewing and applying
&gt; &gt;covers Seems like the kind of job I'd only want
&gt; &gt;to do once.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Sewing is FUNdamental!!  First of all, I have this old Singer from my mom,
&gt; and the wife just doesn't understand why I keep this non-functioning thing!!
&gt;
&gt; Well, now I can show her how nice I can sew two pieces of scrap material
&gt; together, and she asks the next question, &quot;why . . .?&quot;
&gt;
&gt; And honestly, I have  to figure my man hours at a negative figure, since I
&gt; consider this therapy.  You know, I figured out about three years ago that
&gt; if I can go to a junk yard, hack and crack on any vehicle I come across for
&gt; a 6 hour period, and only have to pay $20 for a bunch of parts that are
&gt; worth $50, then I am money ahead.
&gt;
&gt; I was going to replace the front seat covers with Ron Salmon's setup,
&gt; but after I bought all the material, I decided to first try to make some
&gt; fron tseat covers.
&gt;
&gt; This way, I will match the front to the back.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; On the way home last night, I stopped by a
&gt; &gt; &gt; carpet/mattress store.  I asked
&gt; &gt; &gt; the owner if I could snag a mattress from the
&gt; &gt; &gt; pile he was discarding
&gt; &gt; &gt; outside.  I was looking for, and I got, a foam
&gt; &gt; &gt; mattress.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Nice score and nice idea.  Hey, there is a
&gt; &gt;mattress factory just up the road.  (The little
&gt; &gt;wheels spin in the captain's head.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; Don't.  The mattress  was much too heavy.  I am trashing all the mattress.
&gt; I cut the cushion form out of the mattress foam, and really made a mess.  I
&gt; don't mind cleaning up, so it was no  problem for me to sweep the garage
&gt; floor five times last night!!
&gt;
&gt; and the mattress did have al 'old man' cigarette smell, which I am sure
&gt; would permiate the Westy.
&gt;
&gt; There was an auto upholstery shop in PA that I drove by,  then caem back to
&gt; it.  I checked inside, and it was like a garage atic shop, but the single
&gt; owner/worker was making some Jaguar seats.  We got to talking, and he GAVE
&gt; me a whole bunch of upholstery foam.  I have been piece using this stuff for
&gt; four years, and I still have a smattering left.
&gt;
&gt; I may use the foam from the top bed of a late Westy that I got along with
&gt; the material, but I think is might not be wide enough.  We will see....
&gt; More experimentation is needed!!
