Subject: Re: [T2] Elec. ignition, oil temp/RPM questions

I might consider that due to the higher gearing of your tranny, the cooling 
fan is spinning slower per rpm.

Also for each 10 mph, the power required to push the air increased (squared 
or cubed - can't remember).

So you are making you engine working harder for two reasons - higher gear 
ratio (which in the context of a lever - it takes leverage away from the 
engine and gives it to the vehicle. The vehicle has more leverage over 
forward momentum than it had. Or you could consider a 10 speed bike - you 
are now forcing your bus to operate in one gear harder than it used to).

The other reason it is working harder is because you are pushing 'more 
wind' at 75 mph than at 65 mph or even 55 mph.

Any time your engine is working harder you will see higher temps - be it 
the oil or the temperatures of the metals themselves.

Enjoy your bus!! Take care!




&gt;I also have an oil temperature/RPM question. I have a '71 Westy hardtop,
&gt;1776 dual Kadron engine w/ standard doghouse oil cooler, freeway flyer
&gt;tranny. I had chrome tins, but she ran a little too hot for my comfort
&gt;(DUH!). I switched back to black tins, and things have cooled down a bit,
&gt;but I was hoping to open a can-of-worms on the list by asking for some
&gt;opinions on performance. Here's the question: In our wonderful North
&gt;Carolina summer heat (85-95 F.) I can cruise at about 73-75 MPH running at
&gt;about 3500 rpm, but my oil temp climbs up to around 240-250 degrees.
