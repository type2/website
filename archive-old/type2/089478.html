Subject: [T2] Motor Changes For the Bus

&gt;I was just wondering , has anybody ever put a flat 6 from a porsche in the
&gt;bus ?? Like from a 356 or 912 or 911 ?? I was just curious .

Let me be the little devil on your other shoulder.
Do it. Just do it. You know you want it. Do it.
I've got mine, and have a dozen more to spare,
ready for your wildest ride scenario. It's an easy swap.
The 911 has the flat six you want , the others don't.
Unrestrained power is good ( and there is no other
sound quite like it :).Costly ?! You get what you pay for.
Refined German engineering.
