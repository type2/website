Subject: FS in Fresno, Calif

In todays Fresno Bee:

1982 Westfalia, good condition, $2400 559-243-1214

1971 bus, runs good, new clutch, $1500  559-225-8178

1970 camper, pop top, best offer, 559-453-9255

Now you know as much as I do!

But.....except for the unknown price of the 70, the 71 is CHEAP!!!!  compared to the asking prices at the VW
Classic today. Clapped out early bays were priced around $4500 and up.
