Subject: Re: [T2] Ouch - Emergency body repair

Hey Chris, where do you get the &quot;Metal to Metal&quot;
stuff? I'd be interested to try it. I've never had any
trouble with Bondo causing rust, but I'm also pretty
careful about the way I use it and painting over it
quickly, as well.

&gt; &gt;As a footnote, I've heard criticisms of Bondo,
&gt; sometimes by persons
&gt; &gt;commending Mar Glass.  I had always used a product
&gt; called Evercoat, but I
&gt; &gt;decided to try the Mar Glass since the
&gt; recommendation was strong.  It's a
&gt; &gt;very nice product, better than Evercoat.  The other
&gt; day I read the small
&gt; &gt;print on the Mar Glass can and saw that the
&gt; manufacturer is Bondo corp., so
&gt; &gt;maybe Bondo is ok now, I dunno.  Bondo (and its
&gt; generic relatives) is like
&gt; &gt;beer and patriotism-- it's great when used
&gt; appropriately, hazardous when
&gt; &gt;abused.
&gt; 
&gt; Instead of Bondo which soaks up moisture and leads
&gt; to rust - - - get a 
&gt; gallon of metal impregnated filler.
&gt; 
&gt; The brand name I have used is &quot;Metal to Metal&quot;. It
&gt; is a bondo like material 
&gt; full of ground up aluminum. It is waterproof and
&gt; much harder stuff. We have 
&gt; used it to seal Swiss cheese floors with good
&gt; results. (Structurally it was 
&gt; solid with many little holes, full frame car).
