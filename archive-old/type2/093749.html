Subject: Re: [T2] I am STILL Having Starting Probs

If it will start immediately after shutting down and runs fine after a 
jump, You are describing a classic bad battery problem.  The fact that 
it runs after a jump says your alternator is most likely good.  However 
get that battery checked before it terminates the alternator before its 
time.
