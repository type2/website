Hey All,

I've been using Mobil1 in my bus for over a year now. I do have a full
flow filter and use a Fram HP1 filter. Here's my reason for using it. It
survives the heat of an air cooled engine better than conventional oil.
My summer driving in Las Vegas sees very high oil temperatures --
regularly 230-250 over long highway drives. Conversely, if I lived in
colder climes it would flow better at cold temperatures. I change my oil
just as regularly as I would conventional oil. I feel that worrying
about the economics of saving a few bucks on oil when it is such
inexpensive insurance for engine longevity is foolishness on my part. 

My $.02,

Scott
