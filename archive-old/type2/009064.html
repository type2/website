Hello all,
I've also dropped spark plugs deep inside the tin on Type 4 engines.
I have two suggestions for how to solve this problem:

1) Make sure the rubber insert in your spark plug socket is intact and 
grips the spark plug well.

2) Go to your FLAPS and in the tools section find the magnet on a 
stick.  It is a magnet at the tip of a telescoping rod, about the size 
of a ballpoint pen when compressed, but expands out like a car radio 
antenna.  Any spark plugs dropped into the tin can be easily retrieved 
using the magnet.  This also goes for sockets and extensions dropped 
inside the tin (been there, done that).  Best $3.00 I ever spent.
