Subject: Re: [T2] Are these new or restored? - 2002 Type 2

David--

For the ultimate bottom line on the &quot;New&quot; Old Style Bug import thing--

I'm calling one of the advertisers--and find out----

Maybe the system thay use can be applied to the Buses----

Later,

TK--

 
E-mail message   
  

However, I have seen many brand new, old style Bugs that have been
imported from Mexico---South America, in the Sunday Chicago Tribune for
sale---- 


How are these vehicles made available? 
they're restored vehicles, as far as the law is concerned. My
understanding, from a friend who worked/works at a shop that imports
these, is that there is a place in mexico that builds the brand new bugs
on restored, US titled, pans. I've heard its a sanctioned part of the
VWoMex factory, but that's just rumor. 
Unfortunely that doesnt easily happen for a bus....no detachable pan.
