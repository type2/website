Subject: Re: [T2] Locking Gas Cap

I was really excited when I came home today and there was a nice box of 
goodies from VeeVillage, my semi-local parts shop.  I opened it up to 
find a copy of the KC alt newspaper (thank Mike) and several needed 
parts.  Unfortunately the gas cap was the cheesy plastic one that I 
already have.  I got Mike on the horn pronto.  He is now ordering me 
the metal one, which I should have later in the week.  Hopefully it 
will work.

I will, once again, report my findings when the replacement cap arrives.

good day,
mjr
