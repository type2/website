Others may have better info on this than I , but, as I understand it, 
an external (add-on) oil sump just creates a situation whereby it takes 
longer for your oil to come up to engine operating temperature. The 
engine will still run the same temperature. It just takes a few more 
minutes for that temperature to be reached.
