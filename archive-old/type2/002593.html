I'll note here, I initially intend on going down I79 through WV and would
caraBus with any East Ohio or West Pennsylvania types on this side if there
is interest.  Otherwise I intend to hit up with DC folks and go down I81 out
of Winchester maybe?  Or even down the upper Blue Ridge Parkway out of Front
Royal (not sure off the top of my head with no map) (and oops, did I say
that, could we have a few Buses on the parkway??)

Anyway anyone with thoughts that wants to join up from OH, PA, DC, VA, etc
please email me though I'll be gone till the 4/3 so don't worry if you don't
hear back before then.  Off hand I'd probably start out noonish on Friday or
later depending on response.
