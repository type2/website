Subject: Westy? How do I know?

I know I will get a lot of flack for this but I need to know what the 
definition of &quot;westy&quot; is?  I have a 78' &quot;Weekender&quot;, that is the straight up 
camper top, not the slanted, and has all the seats still.  Is that 
considered a &quot;westy&quot;.  You see I am new to the bus thing.  I have owned bug 
all my life and am really good with a type 1 motor but not so good with a 
type 2.  Also what is considered a type 4?
Thanks for the help,
Larry Morris
