&gt;Subject: Bus Boys VS. Bus Stops Center console prices

&gt;hey now,

&gt;i was just browsing through an old (1994) bus stops catalog an saw 
&gt;the center consol that i bought from bus boys. i paid $90.00+ for 
&gt;the console. bus stop (a division of RMMW) has them for $74.95. now 
&gt;i realize that prices may have gone up in 2 years but $20?

&gt;and for some reason, which may be of my own imagination, i was under 
&gt;the impression that bus boys had these things manufactured for 
&gt;themselves. ie, i thought bus boys was the only folks that had them.

&gt;maybe i'm just in a daze.

I bought one that looks almost exactly like it at Wal-Mart for about 
$40.
