Subject: Fixing the Sunroof.

     Hi folks,
     
     I have a 1979 VW transporter with a factory sunroof.  I bought the bus 
     last year from the original owners.  They had caulked the roof shut.  
     The normal problems of leaks and braking cables.
     
     Deciding that I could fix this, I removed the caulking, and tried to 
     open the thing.  I managed to get it open about 6 inches then could 
     not open it any further, nor close it. 
     
     With a little help from the guy at Dick's Autohaus we got it closed.   
     
     Apparently, the runners for the roof are rusted.  I would like to try 
     and fix it, but I do not know how to get to the runners.
     
     Any tips would be appreciated (including do not bother, if that is 
     what you think).
     
     Thanks
     
     Paul
