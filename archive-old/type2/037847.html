I was able to disconnect the coupler and remove the transmission, but only after
cracking all the inner cv bolts, so that
I could save the axles. I drained the gas tank and now have to figure out how to
dispose of 3 gallons of putrid gas. I took
each tire to the gas station and inflated it to the right pressure and
reinstalled them, I tried backing off the stars on the rear brakes but they are
frozen solid and the screwdriver was beginning to damage the rotten backing
plates. I did manage to
free the back wheels with alot of rocking and spraying. I opened the rear
bleeders and pumped the brakes so that I got fluid
coming out each rear bleeder. In the front the pads were frozen to the rusty
rotors which I managed to remove and reinstall
so the wheels were free. So now all 4 wheels roll and the bus is moveable. I
found two transmissions in the basement which
are close to the one that came out, one more so than the other because it has
the upper mounting holes.
 Next on the list,
drill out two cv bolts broken off, on the rear right axle - the drive axle.
install the replacement transmission and two axles.
Remove the rear drums so I can change the brake shoes
wait for the parts to arrive as I finish up the motor (coupler, clutch &amp; gas
cable, front and rear seal, muffler, wheel cylinders,
master cylinder, brake lines) and saw the heater boxes off the original 72
muffler which is finished.
Looks like I'm going to need a new brake servo hose and air check but hate the
dealers price of $90!!!!! Hope I can find a cheaper replacement.
