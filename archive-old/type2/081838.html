&gt; Well......they could be Allen head. I have seen Allen used up until about
the
&gt; end of 77. Later ones are triple square [12 point]. Since he did not give
the
&gt; year of his bus &lt;grrrh&gt; I will assume they are Allen.

Really, I have never seen any allens except ones that were replaced by PO...
Learn something new every day.
