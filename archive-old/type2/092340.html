Subject: Re: [T2] VW Trademarks

A few people have been quick to jump to VWoA's defense. From the
theme of their posts, it's obvious that they haven't taken the time
to actually look and see what the offending product is.  Before
anyone else jumps in and says that VW has a fair case, one might
want to see just what they're so upset about.  Point your browser
(quickly, it'll probably get pulled today.) to:

Personally, I think that VW needs to exercise a bit of judgement.
