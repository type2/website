Subject: [T2] trade books?

Gentlepersons-
                       Recent gifts have left me with a few doubles in my 
collections (the Honus
Wagner card went to another list...), including a slip-cased two volume 
edition including
Martin Buckley's &quot;Classic Cars&quot; and Chris Rees &quot;Dream Cars&quot;.
                       Excepting an exorbitant cash offering; anyone 
interested in trading the
two lower tin pieces (below the cylinders, mounting from case to heat 
exchanger), from
a 2L bus engine, in trade for these fine examples of automotive literature?
