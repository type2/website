&gt; I've noticed that the hot lead into my headlight switch runs hot to the touch.
&gt; I almost think it's going to melt the insulation it's so hot.  Here's what's
&gt; happening
&gt; - when the bus is running, the lead is warm/hot on the headlight switch.  When
&gt; the
&gt; lights are on, the lead is frickin' hot to touch.  At first  I tought that the
&gt; switch
&gt; was bad (too much resistance?) because I only noticed it when the lights were
&gt; on,
&gt; but I've noticed that the lead is hot when the ignition is on.  Any
&gt; ideas/hints 
&gt; to how to trouble shoot this.  Any experiences with this before?

I've used to the wiring diagram to create a continuity testing procedure for
when I go scrounging for them at the junkyard. I don't believe any current
passes through when the switch is in the off position.

This picture shows the wiring to the switch:

The bottom lead is normally connected the grey/red instrument wire but I
disconnected it to take the photo.

I think you need to get out the VOM and see what's wrong. In general the
area behind the dash is a scary place because VW used only the minimum
protection for hot leads.

Be sure to disconnect the battery before doing anything back there and
reconnect it only as you see that it's safe to do so.
