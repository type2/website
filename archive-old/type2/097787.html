Subject: Re: [T2] Samba Effect  /RANT/

So far from what I have read here thus far is only hitting the tip of
the iceberg--

A young lady down in Fla. contacted me on a Westy tent awhile back--
It seems she had an early 70's Westy some time in her past and was sorry
that she sold it--

She found one up in Ohio--don't ask me how--and was prepared to pay this
guy $13,500.00 sight unseen--for a 78

Hers's another deal--another sweetheart out in Conn. bids and buys a 74
Westy at E-Bay-- if I remember correctly she gave $8500.00 for it---now
remember--this is all via pictures, and promises--she pays a trucking
outfit $1400.00 to get it from Oregon to her--

Boy---there are some trusting souls out there--and there are two
chances---slim and none, I'd be spending that kind of cash without at
least taking a spin around the block ---no way Jose--

I think that when these new Microbuses arrive at the dealer's lots that
the prices on the type 2's is going to go crazy---

My daddy once told told me--&quot; Son, there is an ass for every seat&quot;---and
boy oh boy--I see this being true more and more every day--:&gt;) 

Later,
