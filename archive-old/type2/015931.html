Personally, I see nothing at all wrong with the existing resources
available here on the list.  Whenever I have needed help or advice, I have
always gotten a response from somebody on the list.  

While good intentions are running very strong here, I have been reading a
lot of bad ideas.  A &quot;list relief fund&quot; or a &quot;list parts warehouse&quot; involve
somebody spending time and/or money to maintain and will, I repeat WILL,
eventually be the subject of a dispute over who controls the valuables.
The idea of creating a database of list members' addresses and phone
numbers is a really BAD idea, and one to which I will object vociferously.
Everyone on the list please be advised you do not have my permission to put
my name in any such database.

I see nothing whatsoever wrong with continuing to use the list just as it
exists now.  Anyone who needs help is welcome to post a message, and if I
am in a position to help I am going to respond.
