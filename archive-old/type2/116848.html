Subject: turning brakes/my bus baffles me...

Listees....

For those that haven't been paying attention to my problems, my brakes used 
to make my bus turn to the left, pretty hard. So tonight I replaced both 
front brake hoses, bleed the brakes and took a test drive.

Now it still turns to the right, but not nearly as drastically. Improvement 
for sure but not perfect.

Any explanations out there? Are the pads worn unevenly? Could a rear brake 
be causing this? Am I simply asking too much out of my bus to want to brake 
in a straight line??

Thanks in advance,

Daniel
