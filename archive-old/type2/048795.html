Subject: Re: [T2] synthetic oil

Well, I have seen this same thing, but that's like shooting the messenger!

If it has good seals on it, it won't leak. Many bus folk could eliminate 95%
of their leaks if they ran straight STP instead of oil too.

Leaking oil is a symptom of bad seals, not a fault of the oil.

this is my opinion.
