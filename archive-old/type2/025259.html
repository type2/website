I was checking out a friends new pickup and admiring the spray in bed liner.
For some reason I have a complete urge to do the rear cargo area and floor
with this covering as well as the battery trays. I checked into it and cost
would be around $150. According to the propaganda it is impervious to just
about everything including up to a 4KT nuke blast. The surface needs to be
rust free to start, my interior is great but I would need to blast and treat
my trays. It may be the way to keep the floor rust away? I also plan on
doing the whole Kool Patch routine on the underside this winter.
