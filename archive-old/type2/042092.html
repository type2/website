Subject: Re: Dual vacuum fix

hey bucket,
also be sure to check that your advances are working correctly.  The
easy way to quick check vacuum advance is try to turn the breaker plate
counter-clockwise.  It should turn FREELY.  If not, you will need to
clean it (check the archives for an earlier post of mine regarding
rebuilding the distributor).  Now, what I noticed with my distributor
(also a 76 2000fi) that if I put my finger over the outer advance hole
after moving the plate counter-clockwise, it won't hold the plate in
place.  But, if I turn the plate clockwise and cover the retard hold(the
one facing the driver's side) it will hold the plate in place.  I
checked my vacuum can with a vacuum gauge and it was good, so it's ok if
it doesn't hold it on the vacuum advance side.

Next, with the distributor in the engine, try and turn the rotor
clockwise.  It should turn about 10 degrees and then spring back.  If it
doesn't turn, or doesn't spring back, then you need to check you
centrifugal advance.

Another way to quick check that the mechanisms are working(not
necessarily to spec) is get a timing gun and point it at the timing
marks.  Crack the throttle just a hair and the timing should jump up. 
Then take off the outside vacuum hose(the one that goes to the throttle
housing, and crack the throttle again(just a hair like the last time)
and you should notice that it doesn't go up as much.  That's because the
vacuum advance helps advance the timing before the centripital advance
kicks in.

LEAVE THE VACUUM HOSE OFf and then throttle the engine.  You should see
the timing jump up.  If it doesn't, then your centripital advance isn't
working.  If you want to figure out exact numbers, look in your bentley
book.

Hope that helps.

Mike

&gt; &gt; I had our '76 2000ccFI in the shop to get an idling problem fixed. They
&gt; said
&gt; &gt; that the total advance was too high, so they disconnected the vacuum hoses
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; the distributor (dual vacuum can) and timed the engine to 26 degree total
&gt; &gt; advance and replaced the points.
&gt; &gt; Now the engine runs like crap and overheats.
&gt; 
&gt; They are a bunch of idiots!!!   DO NOT GO BACK!!!
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Please help me unfix it by telling me which way to reconnect the vacuum
&gt; hoses:
&gt; &gt; The advance goes to the intake air distributor vacuum?
&gt; 
&gt; NO!  The advance [outer nipple] goes to the nipple on the front of the
&gt; throttle housing. This is ported vacuum. You should have a tee and the other
&gt; line goes to the EEC valve on the back of the air cleaner.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The retard goes to the rear of the throttle valve housing?
&gt; 
&gt; NO!  It goes [inner nipple] to the nipple on the right side of the plenum
&gt; between #1 + #2 intake runners. You need a tee and the other line goes to
&gt; the fuel pressure regulator.
&gt; 
&gt; Set your timing at idle with the vacuum lines connected to 5 degrees after.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; They also disconnected the small vacuum line leading to the EEC cut off
&gt; valve
&gt; &gt; on the air cleaner body, where does that one connect?
&gt; 
&gt; To the advance side of the dist.
