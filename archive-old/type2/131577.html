Subject: RE: [T2] My kitchen isn't from a 77 Westy...

&gt;From: Don Tuleja
&gt;It's not a 77, but an 87-ish! I found an 87 Synchro Westy on eBay that
&gt;had the EXACT kitchen I've got on my patio! Same gray color and
&gt;everything.
&gt;PS: Any recommendations....


Yes pack it all up and ship it to me. I will pack up my '77 Westy Interior 
and send it to you! Sounds great talk to you later.
