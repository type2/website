Subject: Wiper trouble update

Every time I try to fix these things, I end up finding something else 
as the reason for the problem.  I got the circlip off, replaced the 
stripped thread, and hooked it all up.  Low and behold, it works worse 
than 
it did before.  Neither of the wipers move at all. 
I examined it, and, here's one I haven't heard before, 
so I think it might be the real problem.  The treads that the wipers 
sit on, inside the wiper arm itself, appear to be worn down.  So now to 
buy new wipers!  Moral of the story:  Examine every single part of the 
wiper system before you assume it's the motor.
