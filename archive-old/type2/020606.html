{...} I don't know of any authentic looking covers that slip over 
existing upholstery.  I'm sure you could find something at JCW or 
whomever and it would sorta fit, look strange and have you cursing every 
time they slipped sideways.  I put a set of the hog ring attached type 
in my 71. That was 10 or so years ago, and they still look new.  It 
wasn't that bad to do - just takes some patience.  Wolfsburg West and 
I'm sure many other parts places will have everything you need.  Why not 
just do it and get it over with?

&gt; I'm not doing anything near a restoration on these., I'm just looking for
&gt; slip on seat covers (no hog rings) that are durable, and fit good.  JC has
&gt; ones with basketweave listed for 58-77 beetle and superbeetle in stock
&gt; colors.
&gt; These would be perfect if they would fit my bus.  Bus depot has some too, in
&gt; tan grey and blue.  I have original low back bucket with square top, off
&gt; white.
&gt; 
&gt;      I really just want to find out what my options are, and if anyone has
&gt; any experiences or ideas to share.   I don't really want to spend alot on
&gt; slip-ons, if 2 years from now I decide to do this right.  I'm not above
&gt; sheepskin, but won't put in those ones that look like cows either.
&gt;
