Fellow Bussers,

I don't want to start a bad thread, but has anyone else had a hard time
getting a refund for cores sent to MSHP?

Background:

Back in mid August I ordered a set of Vanagon heads to replace the ailing
AMC-Spain heads on my '81.  The new heads arrived within the week and work
fine.  I was advised by MSHP not to bother sending the AMC heads because of
their poor quality, but rather send another set of genuine VW Vanagon head
cores that I had.  Fine, no problem there.  I sent them off and waited.

BTW, the core charge is $250 for both.  They subtract from this each problem
they have to fix on your cores; you'll at least get enough back to cover the
shipping even if they are totally trashed.  In the paperwork with the new
heads they state that it can take 90 days to evaluate the cores.

Well, it's now 4 months since they received the cores and no refund or
explanation.  I've called 3 times and each time they say they will look into
it and call me back...

Needless to say, they haven't called back.  Has anyone else run into this
problem?
