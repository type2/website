Another question peps

What is a good method for testing for a hot aircooled?
Should I be able to touch the block when hot?

I have removed the original air filter on my 72 and now have a pan filter.
This has left a whole in the tin ware... (were the 2.5 inch tube once went,
sim to that of the heater tubes.) If I leave this whole in place, what are
the chances of this increasing engine temp...???

Have a look at my VW site at www.72bay.20m_dot_com
