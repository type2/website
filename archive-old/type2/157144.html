Subject: Re: VWoA Still screwing with people

Okay, 
Just to play satan's advocate (we're still accepting
resumes for the &quot;devil advocate position) look at it
from VW's pov. 
You are using a very recognizable image of their
product. Be honest, you know it looks like a VW, and
you wanted it to look like a VW. 
Unless you've been asleep at the wheel, or new to this
sport, you know that VW has been chasing down anyone
who hopes to make money off their image.
You, were hoping to make money off of their image. 
 
So you drew an image, and you dropped the logo. First
off, that was a very good idea. And I dig the image. 
And chances are it would have flown under VWoA's
radar, until you posted it on something called the
WORLD wide web, AND posted it on a very public site
(cafepress) which specializes in helping you make a
profit off whatever image you send them. 

If you had been a little more &quot;cottage&quot; about it, that
would have been pretty under the radar, but cafepress
is very well known, and very &quot;un-cottage&quot;. I am
personally surprised they (VWoA) didn't fine you as
well as take down the images. 

Remember folks, the internet is an excellent tool for
getting your creative ideas &quot;out there&quot;. Just remember
that it is &quot;out there&quot; for EVERYONE to see. When you
poke the dog, sometimes you get bit.

I do it too, 
Adoom
Chief Advocate, Satan &amp; Co.
