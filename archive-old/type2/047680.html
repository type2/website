Subject: Re: [T2] Bus/Bug wheel swap question

Stephen Leonard sends:

&gt; 1. Are there any particular concerns I should have about replacing my 14&quot;
&gt; bus wheels with the 15&quot; bug wheels, other than wheel-well clearance issues.
&gt; (My plan is to put on a 15&quot; tire that would have the same approximate
&gt; profile dimensions as the 14&quot;'s now on the bus).

Tire diameter. If it's different, you will need to have your speedometer
recalibrated for the new tires.
