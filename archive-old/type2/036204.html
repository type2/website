&gt;
&gt;&gt; I bought some Valvoline 80W-90 gear oil and I plan on changing my tranny
&gt;oil
&gt;&gt; this weekend. The book says 90 weight hypoid. Have I got the right stuff?

&gt;Where are you??  You posted this Monday afternoon? And here in California it
&gt;is 2:56 PM on Sunday.
&gt;
&gt;As long as the gear oil you bought is GL 4 you should be OK. Do NOT use it
&gt;if it says GL 4/5, GL 5, or GL 3-4-5. All Valvoline gear oil I have seen has
&gt;NOT been straight GL 4. The most common brand of GL 4 is Sta Lube. Sta Lube
&gt;says GL 4 on the front label.

Karl is right re:GL-4 only as correct spec. Valvoline does make a proper
GL-3/GL-4 in 80/90 wt. It is called Ford Tractor Lube and I buy it special
order from NAPA in 5 gallon buckets. They may make it in quarts, but I have
not seen it in that form. 

Dallas, you will find on the bottle somewhere the GL designation. If it is
GL-3/GL-4, ist gut. If GL-5 is included, ist too slick and will burn your
syncros.
