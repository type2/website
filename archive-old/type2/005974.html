Folks--

A number of you asked for cost details, and details of added weight for the 
project. I will incorporate specifics on these with the update/upload to 
the heat pages in the coming week, (God-willing). I plan to take some 
current pics of the van (with current owner) to show how it looks finished, 
and how things are holding up.

Overall cost was around $6,000 +/- $1k. We really didn't track it, but I 
will recreate from receipts. This included total motor rebuild, all new 
heater parts, having a couple little spots of rust cut out of the body and 
new metal welded in, all new front &amp; rear suspension parts (ball joint, tie 
rods, link arms, CV's repacked and reversed, all new bushings &amp; bearings, 4 
KYB Gas shocks, Yoka-8ply's, etc,) all brake system parts except booster 
and calipers, various greases, paints, sealants, solvents, rags...as I 
said, we spared no expense. This all took approximately 275 man-hours 
(guessing here).

The added weight was (total guess here, too) no more than 100 lbs. 
Negligible, considering the incredibly positive effect on our enjoyment of 
the van. At some point, I will try to record a couple sound files of the 
doors closing, etc. so folks can hear the difference around the world! :) 
I'll keep you posted.
