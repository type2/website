Subject: Re: [T2] CV's and Molybdenum Disufide

A few years back while in Australia I worked for S.J. Bailey Pty Ltd. based
in Newcastle, NSW.

Stan had me running track drills (airtracs) contracted to the DMR.  I got
real good at this so they put me on drilling batters for pre-split blasting
going down to about 100 feet in 10 foot coupled sections.  The drill rods
are threaded as are the couplings.  Contact is maintained by a rotation of
the drill rod.  When the hole is the correct depth rotation is neutralized
and the air hammer is used to rattle all the couplings loose for disassembly
as the rods and drill bit are extracted.

All this hammering and rotation while drilling creates a lot of heat,
expansion and wear which causes the rods and couplings to bind together.
This problem can be alleviated by greasing the threads of the rods and
couplings.  For this we used a high temperature grease made by a major oil
company but still the equipment lasted only about 6,000 feet of drilling.

One day a representative from Molybond an Aussie company visited our drill
site and asked if I'd like to try some of their grease which contained MSO2,
Molybdenum Disulfide.  I said OK and was able to save Stan thousands of
dollars a year.  This moly grease increased the life of all down hole gear
from 6,00 feet to 60,000 and I got a raise in salary.

When I started independent trucking I only ever used greases with MSO2.  My
last Peterbilt had done 850,000 miles when I sold it and it still had not
had a single greaseable part replaced.

Think about it,

Ian
