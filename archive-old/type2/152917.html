Subject: Re: [T2] Squeek!

Hiya Tris,

I didn't replace any of the bushings.  They seemed to be in pretty good 
shape.  Truth be told, I was going to replace the spring plate bushings but those I 
got from my FLAPs were worse than what I had on the Bus.  So, I greased the 
spring plate bushings.  And I soaked the diagonal arm bushings in silicone 
lubricant.  Both sat for better than a day as I redid my rear brakes so the 
silicone had ample time to soak in.

Like you, I cannot think of any other moving suspension part in that area 
that would produce a squeek.  And this squeek really does seem to be 
bump-in-the-road related.
