Subject: FS: Aircooled Fiat micro-car (looks like small Beetle)

No bus content, but there is aircooled content:   I thought I'd post this
for sale in case someone is interested in a very unique aircooled car.

I have a 1973 Fiat 500L for sale privately. This car looks like a smaller
version of a sunroof beetle.  It's rear-engined and aircooled, with a 500cc
motor.  It's in good shape and is ready to drive, having been a daily driver
until recently.  It's good for short trips or around-town driving; it's
about as slow as an old beetle, goes up to 60 mph but takes a while to get
there.  Very solid, almost no rust, mechanically sound, and very sharp
looking. Definately a head-turner.

I'm asking $3900.  You can see a few pics at http://199.217.241.240/500.jpg
.   Located in Pa., near Philly, Allentown, or Reading.

I also have a '77 Austin Mini for sale, which needs some rust repair (fender
and hood area, not floors or structural) but runs well, for $2900.

Both of these cars came in a container of parts I recently received from the
UK.  I had some extra room in the container so I decided to take advantage
of it.  I also bought another Fiat 500L that I'm keeping for myself.  If I
keep this up I'll need a bigger garage; last year I brought over a couple of
Minis and ended up keeping one of them as well!  My wife's ready to kill me.
