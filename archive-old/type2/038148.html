&gt; Yes, but you see, it STARTED up North on the East coast and has already been 
&gt; through MA, RI, CT, PA, VA, MD, TN, GA, FL, and possibly NC and SC as well.  

also Delaware, DC, and I think NJ and NY

&gt; I'm not saying it should not go back through there again, but I think it should 
&gt; make a trip around the country first.  That was the idea anyway.  So lets get 
&gt; the thing into some states it hasn't been to yet.

and then overseas possibly ending in the VW museum in Germany?!?
