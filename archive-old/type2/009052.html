My friend and I had another look at the Folly's record breaking idle speed
today.   It was a pretty simple fix... the timing was WAY off.  I pulled out
the light just to check and discovered that somehow, the correct timing I
had set up during her first run some time ago, had some how changed.

Over the course of the last few months I've had to rebuild the Follys carbs
a second time.  The first go round, the right hand carb leaked like a seive.
My second rebuild seems to be much better... plus I'd read so much of the
archives and had so many usefull tips from listees, I was better prepared to
look for errors.

Recently Folly was not starting... before the last carb rebuild, much gas
would make its way into the crank case... my continued efforts to &quot;turn her
over&quot; simply added more gas.

Just removing a sparkplug seemed to be an effort that was eluding me... when
my buddy came along he suggested I remove the throttle linkage bar, I did
and the plug was out in seconds... along with the other three.   One plug
was so fouled  &lt; #1 &gt; or faulty that it would not spark...

so to make a long story short... carefully rebuilt carbs, a check for spark
at the plugs, corrected timing, and the Folly seems to be in a better frame
of mind.

She still does not idle perfectly... and she seems to want to give me more
power on acceleration, but something is not quite right.

So.. questions... what else to look for when it come to carb set up in
relation to power... and could the reinstallation of rebuilt carbs have
tossed the timing that far out ???

Please and thank you always!!
