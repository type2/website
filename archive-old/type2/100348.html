Actually, I did.  This is where the exception to the rule comes in.  
Although, as I know from collecting G.I. Joe, when you bring something back 
new, but in it's original form, it tends to bring the value of the original 
down.  I found this out when I purchased the FAO exclusive GI Joe Astronaut, 
just like the one from 67.  It brought the value of the original down.  But 
seeing as the original Beach Bomb has never been seen in packaging, (that's 
the one with the boards coming out the rear window) I guess it could bring 
down the value to about 5k.  This is one of the most expensive diecasts 
anywhere.  Whomever finds one in the packaging, can ask what they want.  I 
hope it's me!!!!!!

&gt;Hi
&gt;    You obviously did not get in on the Hotwheels Beachbomb II bus that 
&gt;went
&gt;on sale online earlier this month.(Now sold out)  Was a replica of the old
&gt;school beach bomb bay window bus complete with metal chassis.
