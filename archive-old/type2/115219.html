Subject: Re: [T2] Dynamic vs. Static Timing Adjustment

Hi-

Thanks much to all that responded to my querie. There seems to be several
schools of thought on this, and I wanted to try them all, and learn what I
can. (And yes, I had read Ken Hooper's article on this in the library, and
also the Ken's Buggy Barn instructions.)

Interestingly, static timing, dynamic timing at idle, and dynamic timing for
total advance all seem to result in only a degree or two of change in my
engine. Within this range of 28-32deg total advance (or 7-9deg at idle) is
there any advantage to being at one end of the range or the other?

Thanks for the guidance.

Cheers,

Matthew
