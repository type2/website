Subject: Re: [T2] Re: 185/195 now 205

&gt;yeah I've got a feeling I may have to figure out how to stuff 215s into
&gt;mine the next time I need tires...(anyone tried it??) since good light
&gt;truck tires are still available in that size
&gt;

Not that I want to start another thread, but,
I have fitted 215/75R15's (off road tyres) on my '77 2L (Merc 'E' series
rims) all round.
They're rated as LT, ~1800lbs, ~50psi from memory. No problems fitting, no
mods required (I even fitted clips to mount the original hub caps), They do
limit steering lock a little though.
Great for off road clearance, but makes the gearing very tall on a stock 2L
motor with a 2L box (and puts the speedo out ~8%). The bus also weaves a
little at speeds over 50mph (scary in high winds). I think that's because
they are quite flexible in the side walls.
I have these for 'off road adventures' and use the standard tyres/rims
normally.
Have a look at &quot;Andy&quot;, red and white at
