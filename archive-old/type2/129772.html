Subject: Re: [T2] wiring on a VDO 50-150 Cel. oil temp gauge??

At 11:59 AM 4/2/2004 -0800, you wrote:
&gt;  I've acquired a 50 - 150 degree Celsius oil temp gauge from a GTI. It has a
&gt;single wire light connection on the back so uses a standard body ground to
&gt;supply the ground. That I understand. The part I don't understand is that
&gt;there are three wires on the back of it still. The middle one is brown and
&gt;touches the gauge body so I assume that is the ground for it. There are
&gt;still two more however that are unmarked. Do BOTH of these go to a temp
&gt;sender?? I am not sure, as no markings are on the gauge back. The other two
&gt;wires are a black one, and a green/black-stripe one. Help??

One thing you could try is to hook up the gage to a temp sensor in boiling 
water on the various terminals. that way, you could try which one works. 
Maybe they both work? is there some sort of switch anywhere?

Another possiblity, depending on how new the GTI was, is that the gage is 
digital, and so needs a lower noise ground connection. (that last one is a 
wild guess). OOR! wait, if it's digital, it needs to be powered as well, so 
it needs a light, which goes on when you turn on the headlights (light 
connection), Ground, Signal (from temp sender), and 12Volt to amplify the 
signal. Maybe that needs to be there for an analog gage too? , maybe others 
know?
