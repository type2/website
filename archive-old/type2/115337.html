Subject: '74 engine for a '72 bus

Hi.

Currently, I have a '72 project Westy, and a '78 daily driver Westy.  The 
'78 Westy  gets me to work and back every day for the past 2 years, and I 
have owned the '78 for the past 8 years and 70k miles.

Saturday, I came across a '74 Westy with a full '74 engine/trans.  I liked 
the single carb (looked clean, like just rebuilt) that was sitting on top of 
the engine.  I thought about just pulling the carb and manifolds and playing 
with that on my '72.

Then I thought about some engine tin I could use, and the fuel pump, and so 
forth.

Last night I asked myself, why not take the whole engine ($150), pull off 
the non-engine things and have it rebuilt for $800.

Rebuilt = the mechanic does both heads, I guess rings or P&amp;C [advertises new 
P&amp;C for the price] and the rest of the bearings and grind the crank shaft 
[the mechanic sends the cranks out to be ground, to the same place for the 
past 20 years] and clean the oil pump.

And I could get to stand over his shoulder as he does the work, and he would 
explain things to me.


Yes, there has been discussion on the single carb not working as it should 
in the cold season.

What other 'bad' things should I look out for?

1)  When you pull the engine, remember to get the _________ from the 
________.

2)  The '72 trans (standard) and clutch    WILL    or    WILL NOT   match up 
with the '74 engine, so be sure to get the _______ from the '74 trans 
(standard)

3)  Since you will have the '74 trans on the ground, pay the guy $75 for it, 
but be sure to get the ______.  [or forget about it]


4)  It is a    GOOD idea    or    WORTHLESS idea    to get the '74 bell 
housing for $30.


Anything else??


Thank you
