&gt;In the latest issue of Transporter Talk, the UK's type 2 
owners club
&gt;magazine (that arrived this morning), there is a letter 
from a guy who
&gt;converted a 1987 Syncro using 2 tanks underneath the 
chassis.  This was
&gt;helped by the extra ground clearance on the Syncro.  There 
is no contact
&gt;number or email with the letter.  He doesn't say how big 
the tanks were or
&gt;how much range he gets.
