Subject: Soundproof Challenge

Greetings list,

I got my 78 Sagegreen Westfalia back from the paint shop a few weeks ago. It 
is a total shell. I have read the heat, rust and noise article several times 
but I don't think I have the budget for that extensive of a soundproofing 
project (Q-pads=$$$). Also, I am skeptical about coating the inside of my 
bus with cool patch. Odors? I plan to cool patch the underside of the 
vehicle though.

My question/challenge is if you had $200 to put into soundproofing what 
materials would you get and where would you put them? NASA insulation, 
Q-pads, cool patch?, Dynamat or similar, plus expansion foam?

And would $200 worth of materials make a significant difference?

I would love to hear from others who have soundproofed their busses. What 
you did, how it helped and how much it cost.

I am thinking expansion foam in all voids, NASA insulation in most of the 
engine compartment and then focus most other efforts around the nose and 
under the pedastool rubber combating front tires noise.

Any ideas much appreaciated.

Thanks,
Brandt
