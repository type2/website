Subject: Re: SOTO or NEATO?

&gt;&gt;The 59 Westy I just bought has a SOTO sticker on it.  Don't know much about
&gt;&gt;them.  I do know about NEATO, though.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Anyone care to enlighten me, and offer a testimonial or two?

Definitely go with NEATO. I live just a hop skip and jump from David 
Heard/SOTO and I'm lucky to receive my nesletter on time. He's now up to 
the March issue for this year. This month's newsletter was pitiful. 
Nothing but ads. 

Dump SOTO, and go with NEATO.
