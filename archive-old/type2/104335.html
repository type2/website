Subject: Re: [T2] no heater boxes? safe?

&gt; So, im ready to tackle the BA6 install project, which will hopefully
&gt; both give me heat and eliminate any exhausty smells from coming into the
&gt; cabin. My wife is rather sensitive about those smells, so I was planning
&gt; in just removing the old heater system, since it wont even channel into
&gt; the bus anymore. 

I've done that, sort of.  

&gt; But, does it serve another use? Can I get rid of that fan in the engine
&gt; compartment, and those two hoses, or is that not a good idea? 
&gt; 
&gt; And what about the heater boxes, will I need them anymore, for
&gt; non-heating use? 

OK here is what I have done on my 78, I have completely removed the stock
heating system, rear blower, hoses, heater boxes, duct to the front. if
you remove these remember to block off the small ducts at the bottom of
the engine cooling blower assembly...

I have then mounted a BA-4 (slightly smaller than the BA-6) under the
front pan of the bus, where the A/C evaporators were formerly hung,  I
then but two big blowers in the cab behind the dash, intake under the
dash, thru two new holes in the floor to the BA-4 input.  output was then
ducted back into the regular heat duct near the front beam...

keeps me warm.  full details are in the library
