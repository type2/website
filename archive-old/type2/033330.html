Subject: Spare Wheel

Hi!

Can someone tell me how to mount the spare wheel at the front of my bus? I
have seen alot of pictures, but non that tells me how to mount it.
Will the panel hold the wheel without getting to much dents?
I have seen that some wheels are resting on top of the bumper. I guess
that`s a better way but it don`t 
look so nice....

Thanks
