Hey all,

Before our admins decide to break us up into yet another &quot;list&quot; (the tire
debaters), hows about some knowlegable, experienced soul do a cool write up
on tires vs Type2's? I can post this to the TYPE2.COM &quot;Library&quot; (on the
net) and point newbies/researchers there.

 I wont go complaining about my delete finger but I have heard of others
voice their sickness of the cyclical tire hash.  Agreed, there is merit in
these discussions as all too often &quot;tire guys&quot; have no idea what we need
and give us &quot;Bug&quot; tires cause thats what there &quot;Buddddd-eeee&quot; back in the
dope days liked.

I think some of the pertinent topics should include (all in relationship to
Type2's...not general stuff...it is already posted):

1.  Sizes
        a.  Width (How wide can we go is big, including year model
references... that is if Clara isnt too sick of quoting this info...I know
I have heard it repeated by her at least four times this year).
        b.  Height (and its relationship to gearing, speedo...)

2.  Plys (My 2-plys have done me good for years but the elders shake their
heads at me).

3.  Anything else? (Are manu's relavent?  Lets keep universal/timeless
here.)

Please NO Type2 &quot;TIRE&quot; List split!!!!!!!!!!

Help.....
