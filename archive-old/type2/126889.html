Subject: Bay Bus Windshield

Regarding a new windshield for a Bay and need it in a
hurry



Michael
Call your local auto glass shops and check prices...I
had Triumph Auto Glass come to my home and install on
my 79 Westy a new PPG windshield for 120$ total cost
the same day I called! Seemed like a good deal.

Good luck
