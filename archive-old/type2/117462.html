&gt; Can some one tell me the differences between dual carb motors and FI besides

&gt; I'm getting a spare motor &amp; GB that is FI (out of a '75 kombi) that I was
&gt; hoping to make a spare for my bus, '77 dual carb.
&gt; What I'm wondering is how hard it is to make it dual carb?

well to ask the obvious question, why do you want to degrade the motor, it
was designed to be FI and is now FI, and your 77 was designed to be FI, so
why in the name of Dr Porsche do you want to make it less than it is
designed to be....I could get into the DM now but I will pass on that
