&gt; ...My Husband uses a sharpened stub pencil...

This is, as I recall, what John Muir recommends. I got really gassy once 
when I assumed that my pencil would plug the gas stream and discovered 
only too late that the pencil was not large enough in diameter and I had 
gasoline running down my sleeves and into my armpits. 

Nowadays I use a pair of big hemostats with a little electrical tape wrapped 
around the tips to take the edge off the gripping texture. I have also 
found that a golf tee is about the right size and taper to do a good job. 

Nothing will get me cussing louder and faster than a gas leak 
accumulating on my body. Yuk! $^%##_at_&amp;%%#!&amp;$!!!
