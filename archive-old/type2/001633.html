Subject: gas gauge wire
Date: Mon, 8 Feb 1999 22:36:33 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Careful as I was, I broke the wire that the float glides up and down past,
in the gas gauge sending unit in my 71 Westy.  Not the post that runs down
the middle of the float, but the wires that send the signal.  I'm handy
enough with a soldering gun to replace it, but don't have a clue as to the
spec on the wire.  Anybody out there know?  How about a source?  Other than
that, the unit looks fine, just got a little gunked up on rust.  Thanks.

John in Flint, MI
