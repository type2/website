Subject: Re: [T2] Sunroof idea's for 71 bus

Hello,

I was able to get a really good deal on one of these
&quot;ragtops&quot; that was new in the box from one of our
favorite auction sights. The one I &quot;won&quot; is navy blue.
The construction seems to be good. The seller said he
has a one on his bus and it does not leak and he loves
it. It is quite large and you will have to cut a hole
in the roof. It came with instructions and everything
needed to install it. I have not installed it yet. The
engine and brakes comes first... They are a bit over
priced though :(

Have a great day!
Regards,

David Kelly

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
... So, I've
&gt; been thinking about 
&gt; making my own rag-top cover for it and thought I'd
&gt; ask around and see if 
&gt; anybody here has done that and could give me some
&gt; pointers about materials, 
&gt; etc. I couldn't find any info in the type2 archives.
