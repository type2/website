I am going to replace one of my CV boots.  Lots of fun, and great 
satisfaction.
This time, I am going to MARK the NEW boot with today's date, and where I 
got the boot from.

I will make two small notes; one I will tape to the side of the CV boot 
metal (flange??)so I can keep track of when I put it on, and the other will 
'time capsule' between the (flange??) and one of the three circular and flat 
keepers.  If I loose one, I will have the other when I replace the boot 
again.

I use 'metal tape' to mark other things, like the date and inside diameter 
of the brake drums after they were last measured (by Track Auto, for free). 
I cut a piece of metal tape off the roll, write the info with a ball point 
so that I get an impression, and then stick the tape under one of the two 
brake drum 10mm nuts.  Also mark the last compression readings and tape this 
to the top of engine compartment.

My oil changes are written on the wall of the garage, for the past 5 years, 
for all the vehicles, including when the 'new' tires got put on, etc..
