Thanks for the info.  The hot air pipes in my exhaust
system now are vitually non-existent due to rust, so
they're not quite as important as the exchangers.  My
main worry right now is to have a functioning exhaust
system without leaks, but some heat would be nice
(there is none right now because of totally rusted
through exchangers, air pipes, and control boxes).  In
my state I, luckily, do not have to have a catalytic
(83 and earlier are exhaust exempt in massachusetts). 
I guess I might have to get the lower tin and the
pipes too.

Thanks a lot.

&gt; &gt; I'm looking for a set of decent condition heat
&gt; &gt; exchangers for my 76 bus.  I'd like to put a set
&gt; of 74
&gt; &gt; exchangers in, because they bolt right into the
&gt; &gt; manifold and simplify everything.  My exhast
&gt; system
&gt; &gt; now has some leaks. All the flanges on the pipes
&gt; were
&gt; &gt; badly bent and will still not seal well after
&gt; having
&gt; &gt; been hammered and filed.  I'm also in need a a
&gt; muffler
&gt; &gt; that would fit a 74 and a set of heater control
&gt; boxes
&gt; &gt; (mine are rusted through and totally useless).  If
&gt; &gt; anyone has these to sell and lives near the boston
&gt; &gt; are, please let me know.
&gt; 
&gt; You need more than just heater boxes and a muffler
&gt; if you are going this
&gt; route. You will also need:
&gt; 
&gt; the 72-74 lower tin
&gt; 
&gt; the lower front cylinder tin on each side from a
&gt; 72-74
&gt; 
&gt; both left and right hot air pipes between the boxes
&gt; and the flapper valves
&gt; from a 72-74, they are round....75 up are oval
&gt; 
&gt; both air pipes that go thru the upper cylinder tin
&gt; and the blower fan
&gt; connect to
&gt; 
&gt; the alternator support, 72-74 bolts to the side of
&gt; the heater box
&gt; 
&gt; Just buying boxes and a muffler is not going to get
&gt; it.....
&gt; And what about EGR? Do you have it / need it for
&gt; smog purposes? How about a
&gt; catalytic converter?
