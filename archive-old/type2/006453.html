Subject: Back road driving.

As the subject line says I enjoy driving back roads whenever possible. While
reading my AAA magazine  I came across a web site that I thought y'all might
enjoy. it's www.roadfood_dot_com  and it specializes in out of the way places to
eat. I think I'll use it to plan my trip down to BBBV and see how it works.
 Bus content:
I made a 2x4 rack today that fits inside the bed of my DC and is about 1&quot;
above the side gates so that I can transport my 12' fishing boat with me and
still be able to drop the rear gate to load extra stuff. Now I need to
figure a way to attach a light to the boat and tie it into my running lights
so I'll be legal at night. Anybody have any suggestions?
