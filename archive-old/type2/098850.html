Subject: Another fluctuating dwell (wierd)

Hi list,

I recently installed the Pertronix ignitor on my stock dizzy and it works great - very stable timing, smooth acceleration and the dwell is solid at 54 deg. Soon after, I installed the 40,000 volt Pertronix flame thrower coil  and noticed that the dwell was very low (around 25) at idle and increased to just above 50 during acceleration. I turn the problem on and off simply from going from the hot coil to a standard one and vise-versa. Needless to say, I went back to my old coil, but does anyone have a possible explaination how this could happen?
