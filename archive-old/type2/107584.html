Subject: Re: [T2] Re: fuel pressure

&gt; Actually the opposite is true. The injectors pulse on time varies  as a
 function of throttle advance. The differential pressure at the  injector tip
 is fixed at the regulator value measured with the vacuum line removed from
 the regulator. The details can be found in  &quot;Bosch Fuel Injection &amp; Engine
 Management&quot;  by Charles O. Probst,SAE.

Then Charles has not seen the difference with and without vacuum at idle using Calif smog test equipment!  CO
goes way up when the vacuum line is disconnected and capped. Fuel pressure goes to 35ish and the bus WILL fail
the smog test. Real life and text books are 2 different things.
