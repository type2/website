&lt;&lt; Gentlepersons-
                      Does anyone have the exact dimensions of the exhaust 
studs on a
pancake engine. I might have a source for stainless. Also, any metallurgists, 
with
pros/cons to this? I've heard that stainless &quot;work-hardens&quot;; would this be 
peculiar
to a specific grade or just in general?
Thanks in advance.

I don't know the length, but these are stepped studs.  The head side is 9mm 
and the exhaust side is 8mm.

You will find oversized studs in many of these engines.  These are 10mm on 
the head side.

Stainless would likely not be strong enough.  I've heard that stainless 
becomes brittle after repeated heating and cooling.
