...it's the wiring to the starter from the key. It's long, old,
&gt;and doesn't carry the voltage that it used to when it was new...

TWIMC,
I was wondering about that.  Maybe i don't know enough electronics or chemistry or whatever, but is it really possible for the actual wire itself to become more resistant (or less conducive) over the years?  Is there some sort of chemical change that goes on in the metal that can cause this, or are we looking at corrosion of the contacts, corrosion in between the acual strands of the braided wire causing some of this or a breakdown in insulation material?  Can a metal suddenly decide that its not going to conduct electricity anymore?  If so, how?
