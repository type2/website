&gt;Good idea to stopper everything.  Can I stopper the aux air regulator?
&gt;Doesn't this require air flow at startup time?  It is my understanding

It's a termperature based fast idler until the car warms up.

You'll have to unscrew it from the engine tin to determine if the hose leading from it to the air dist. manifold is leaking...
