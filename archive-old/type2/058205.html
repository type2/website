Subject: Finally Bought a Bus
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Ad in Saturday's local paper. 1975 VW camper. White. Very low miles. $2,200 or
best offer. Divorce.

I didn't see the ad, and my college-senior son came home about lunch time. &quot;Oh
no, lookand this and I bet it's already sold!&quot;  He called about 1. &quot;Some guy
is coming at 3 to look at it and I have friends over for the UT game--call
back later.&quot; My son called. Guy is getting a divorce, he bought bus in 1992
with only 43K miles on it from little old man original owner in Maryville (has
King VW sign on back, now defunct Maryville dealer) and it's only got 77K
miles on it now. He asked me to try calling. 

&quot;My son just called--we've been looking for about 1 year. I've got cash in
hand and will buy bus if it is as described.&quot; Owner said half-time is in 15
minutes--I'll show it to you if you can come then. I was there in 7 minutes.
Bought the bus for $2,000 which was his cash price. Drives great except for a
holey muffler with very tight suspension. He had all his repair records.
Besides regular oil changes and valve adj. it's had:

Rebuilt rear brakes at 58,610
2 new tires and 4 wheel alignment  71,121
Clutch job with both F&amp;R oil seals  appx. 74,000
2 new tires at 76,018
New Fuel pump and filter  apx 76,500  

Bus has been sitting in his Ex's garages with her holding title. She hadn't
pushed selling it because 10-yr-son grew up with bus, but it finally came time
to sell it. 

Paint is very good with some surface rust:
behind front spare tire carier and 1 small spot under windshield
some rust under both removable curved pieces under side windows
minor dent with some rust under passenger rocker
small ding w/rust on driver's door from camping trip
battery box floor gone and quicky patched.
We have most of the rust sanded and extended.

The front floor and rear engine cover floor both look like new paint. The rear
seat material and stool seat material look like new. Tent has not rips with
dry-rotted thread on screen for about 1/2 the width that I resewed. Upper bed
material looks fresh. Front seats are just about worn out. Except for the
front seats, the mileage could be right. This is the best driving for-sale bus
I have driven. The rear screen, front privacy curtain, front child's cot and
original curtains are all there in good shape.

Son can't wait to tailgate at some UT football games and I hope to have it
muffled and checked out in time for Circle Yer Wagens at Sevierville in
October. The owner was VERY happy it was going to someone who would take care
of it and take to VW shows. He said he might want to buy it back in 3 or 4
years. I felt bad about his circumstances but we live about 1/2 mile apart and
he wants to come look at it when we get it all together.

Also--I'm going to the South East Bug Fair at Toccoa, Ga on Sunday Sept 13th
and will try to take some event photos especially some bus photos. I have a
new web page and will try to post some photos. Besides the list hat, I hope to
have some of my other VW stuff there to see.
