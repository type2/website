Subject: Re: 1600 DP in a 82 Vanagon

&gt;I ducking already, but have a beautiful vanagon body with a bastard engine.
&gt; Looking to put an engine in that I am familiar with to make her a grocery
&gt; getter, as I do not want to spent the $$ for a new engine. This baby is
&gt; hacked, all FI stuff gone, single carb, etc...  It runs OK but don't trust it
&gt; (rear cooling tin gone, smokes some).
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody done it? Is it possible?

 Sure- VW did it. Sold a bunch of them in Europe: probably elsewhere, too.
 Unfortunately, in order to do it they had to shift the fuel pump and
distributor, move the carburettor and reroute a lot of the engine
plumbing. They didn't have to contend with emissions inspections,
either.
 The problem is the lack of space above the engine in the vanagon
body: hence the pancake engine. If you were prepared to build up the
hatch cover then it might be possible.
 There's been discussion on the vanagon list about putting Golf
engines in vanagons (those watercooled folks will try anything).
 It might be worth looking into as there seems to be some quite
professional groups involved. Of course, this might not meet your
requirements (cost, familiarity etc.).

Cheers,
         W.
