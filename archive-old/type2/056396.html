Subject: FI and head temp sensor

Morning,

I have a 71 Bus with a CB Performance DFI system installed. I've been
running it for almost 5 years. In the past few months I have had a weird
problem when it's hot (running for 20-30 minutes). If I shut it off and
came back 5-10 minutes later it would start and idle but if I tried to
accelerate it bogs down like I'd pulled a plug wire (or 2). Usually
after a few minutes of idling and very slow advancement of the throttle
it starts to run OK.  I have good spark (new coil, points, condenser,
plugs), it has a new O2 sensor, the injectors have been tested and are
OK and fuel PSI is good (42).

Here's my question for all the electrical gurus -- yesterday I was
poking around and was considering re-installing an old head temp sensor
that I had. When I started to loosen the installed one it was loose --
wobbly loose. It took 3 or 4   turns to get it back in and tight. It is
a stubby bayonet sensor that fits the sensor hole on a stock head (I'm
assuming for a Type 3 engine). In the scheme of things could this have
been my problem? 

Thanks,

Scott
