Subject: [T2] Need to Stretch Muffler and Heat Riser Tube

It appears that the previous owner installed some spacers between the
case and cylinders.  This is complicating my plans to use a stock
muffler and stock 34 pict carb on 1600 dual port.  It appears that
the spacing between the #2 and #4 exhaust ports is 3/16&quot; too wide.

I'd appreciate any suggestions as to how to stretch the muffler and
heat riser tube to fit.  I'd rather not go dual carbs and extractor
exhaust.
