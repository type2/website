My turnkey 2 L with muffler, strapped to a pallet roughly the same size as
the motor, with a waferboard crate built around it, weighed in just a hair
under 500 pounds US.

Subtract for muffler and crate and you're probably looking at around 400
pounds US.

If at al possible use &quot;terminal-to-terminal&quot; shipping rather than
&quot;door-to-door&quot;. Get the current holder of the motor to carry it to the
freight companie's most local trucking terminal and you pick it up on your
end. Having them pick it up and drop it off at your specified location can
add several hundred $$$ to the cost and may even be impossible in some
residential areas because engine-sized loads are usually delivered as part
of a semi-trailer load. If they have to transfer it to a smaller truck for
local delivery you REALLY pay for it.
