I can go you one better.  My dwell meter is the SunPro that is available from that surplus web site.  Total was I think $16 including shipping brand new.  Got THREE digital multimeters at Harbor Freight on sale for $3.99 each.  They are the yellow ones and I know they are not Flukes but they do provide useful information and for basic voltage and resistance checks they work just fine.  Timing light - I got a name-brand one at a garage sale for $5.  My point is not to try and one-up you Chris, but just to strengthen your argument that adequate tools can be obtained inexpensively if one doesn't insist on flagging down the Snap-On truck with their credit card.  Leave Snap-On tools for the professional mechanics unless your ego just can't take the hit.  :-)

&gt;Last summer I bought a $129
&gt;Raytech (?) infrared temp gun with a fresh battery for $10

That's a great score Chris!!  I'm jealous.  :)  I recently got a new-looking Proto 1/2&quot; breaker bar at a swap meet for $7 which I thought was very good.  I have found swap meets to be the best source of cheap tools.  Here in the Dallas/Ft.Worth area we have several large automotive-theme swap meets per year and they always have tables full of Craftsman wrenches and sockets.  Sockets are generally $1 or less if you buy in bulk and wrenches are a buck or five depending on size.  Always way less than retail and a good way to complete a set if you are missing one or two.  I got a Craftsman sandblaster there a couple of years ago for $20, some 4'x6' rubberized carpets for $4/each (nice for the garage) and don't even get me started on air tools!  Got an Ingersoll-Rand 3/8 air ratchet for $10 a couple of years ago among others.


&gt;Engine rebuild - what kind of tools? A few wrenches or sockets (10mm, 13mm,
&gt;15mm, 17mm, 19mm). Torque wrench - borrow (free) or buy a cheap beam type

Heck yeah - the beam type are great.  I've seen the click-type fail and of course they are much more expensive.  My beam-type Craftsman torque wrench was bought new for my first type4 rebuild back in 1988 and it still works just fine.  I think I paid about $25 for it.  Since it technically has no moving parts it should last forever, but if it does fail it will be obvious.

&gt;Never needed anything but my mismatched ragtag collection of
&gt;random tools. 

Same here.  My friends make fun of me for my random assortment of wrenches and screwdrivers but I always have what I need to get the job done and I spend that money on more important things.
