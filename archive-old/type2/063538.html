My message was confusing. I have a 6 volt round, sideways oriented motor my '65 (not
the square one used on earlier busses).

My ** real ** question should have been which 12V motor can I replace it with? Do I
have to find a sideways oriented 12V, and does one exist, or, can I use a 12V square 
motor in that frame?
