Subject: Re: [T2] Did Westfalia do Hightops?

Hi Volks!

&gt; I couldn't say whether or not they had a hightop baywindow Westy. I do

Indeed they did.  I've never seen an original hightop Bay Westy
though, just the various poptop flavours.  I understand there 
were hardtop Westies too, with and without sunroof -- but I've
never seen one of them either.  

BUT: Hardtop Westies weren't in the official sales brochures
either.  So if they built those to order, chances are that they
*might* have built Westies based on the factory hightop Kombi
as well, if someone was crazy enough to order one (as opposed
to getting a hightop Kombi and doing the camper conversion 
themselves, or getting a Westy and grafting on the hightop 
themselves).  But again, I've never seen nor heard of a factory
hightop Bay Westy, so I doubt that there were any.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
