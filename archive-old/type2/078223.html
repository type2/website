    I think you'll find that you needle problem is related to the needle 
shaft or needle (as someone mentioned).  The drive for the needle is actually 
magnetic.  This allows you to back up with out the needle going backwards.  
The magnet is not strong enough to pull the needle past the peg at 0 mph.  
You may need a drop of oil on the shaft.  I use 3 in 1 house hold oil.  The 
main trouble is you have to pull the glass of the speed-o to do this.  I use 
a very small screw driver to bend the bezel lip, and have built a bezel tool 
to put it back on.  Having gone that far though, you might as well rebuild 
the damn thing.  I don't know what lube VW used on the main drive system of 
the speedo, could be whale oil for all I know.  But over time this lube turns 
soild.  It's basiclly a matter of cleaning the old stuff out  and relubing.  
I like to use luberplate.  You may wanna play with a trash speedo before you 
tear into you nice one.  But with a little pratice, you can rebuild a speedo 
in about the time it takes to watch a football game.  If I can pass on any 
more info, give me a yell.

many VW's to list
