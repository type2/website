Subject: BN4 heater-- so close... help.

Hi all,

	With all this ado about BN4 auxiliary heaters recently, I decided to
look things up and find out exactly what that large sausage was in the
left of my engine compartment.  Turns out I have a late model BN4, mint,
in there.  No rust, no scratches, no dents, nothing.  All hooked up.

	SO, I sez, let's geddit wurkin'.  Downloaded the library files on the
subject (thanks Ron!) and tested a couple of things.  Results: fuel
delivery is fine (about 15ml [ie 1 tablespoon] per 200 clicks), fans
hums merrily along without hesitation at the flick of the dashboard
timer switch.  I put my hand next to the intake hose, and can feel a
draft going in.  It's getting air.  The only thing I haven't checked is
the spark/glow plug, because I don't have the proper nut in hand right
now.
	
	Problem: I'm not getting any heat.  Just air from under the rear seat. 
This is far from overwhelming for a gas heater, thinks I.

	What I *did* get after a few unsuccessful test runs was a white smoke
quietly whafting out from the intake hose. Not wanting to screw up a
good thing, I stopped right there and decided to seek advice from y'all
before potentially messing an almost working unit.

	My question, then, for all you BN4 experts out there: what's up?
where's the heat?  I've got gas, I've got air, and I *think* I have some
sort of spark otherwise that white smoke wouldn't be there. I can just
feel that I'm **this close** to driving a toasty warm bus--aaargh.

	BTW, the PO told me stories (don't they always?) of him camping in the
van and being almost toasted alive by the power of this nuclear sausage
in the engine compartment.  So I know at one point it worked.  Why I
haven't checked it until now, two years into ownership, is beyond me. 
Kick me please.

Anyways, thanks in advance for the help...
