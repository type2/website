&gt; Both the Vanagon engines I have torn down (well.... one's partially
&gt; assembled now) had windage trays.  To me, the windage tray looks to be an
&gt; oil pickup tube that reaches into the sump, with an inverted metal &quot;bowl&quot;
&gt; down at the pickup end.  I suppose if the oil level in the sump was high
&gt; enough to cover the hole that the &quot;upper&quot; end of the windage tray pipe
&gt; goes into, the oil pump could suck oil even with the tray missing.
&gt; 
&gt; None of the manuals I have shows a picture of the windage tray, but at
&gt; least one of them (Haynes??) mentions it.
&gt; 
The windage tray is shown in Tom Wilson's book on how to rebuild your
volkswagen engine.  It even explains the purpose of it, which is to keep
the crank from picking up all the oil in the sump.  It also keeps the
oil from all going to one side when you go around a corner.
