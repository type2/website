I am new to having a bus with an automatic, and was wondering.

All I have read indicates you should not jump batteries to start a bus
with a dead battery. Is this due to the danger of hooking the cables up
wrong and frying the 'puter, or is it dangerous even if you connect them
correctly?

How then to start a bus with a dead battery?

Also should the battery be disconnected to charge it as well?
