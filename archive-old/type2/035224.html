Subject: Cleaning Alternator?

Can anyone give me any suggestions on a product to use to clean an 
alternator?  My alternator is covered with oil and grease.  Not just a little 
bit, but lots of oil and grease.  I don't want to risk hurting the windings.  
I remember reading somewhere, could have been Wilson, to use triclorothane 
but could not find a product in the local parts store that contained 
triclorothane.

Thanks,
