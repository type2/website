Subject: Re: [T2] Westfakia values?

Hi Adrian,

Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.

Well done Westfakia's should sell for very close to a &quot;real&quot; Westfalia of
similar quality. There is a lot of variation in the quality of both, but if
all things are equal the price should be close to equal as well.  If you're
uptight about &quot;Original Factory Configuration&quot; then this isn't

Putting the hole in the roof is easier than you might think, particularly
with a 68-73 westy. I built &quot;Bob the Tomato&quot; with a 79 body, 73 westy engine
and interior and a 74 pop-top.  I wanted the double bed upstairs to sleep my
family of 5 inside the van, but I like the 68-73 layout for general utility
around town. 

I cut the roof from the 74 with about 6&quot; of metal framing the hole all the
way around and then fit it over a new hole cut into the 79 roof with a 2&quot;
overlap. The roof sections were welded together and the seam isn't very
noticeable since its under the fibreglass when the roof is down and no-one
looks above the driprail when the roof is up anyway. The whole job took
about 100 man-hours... doing a 68-73 roof would take half that time since
the roof structure is simpler. If you have welding or autobody experience
you could cut that figure in half again.

There are lots of pics of the process online at:

Let me know how it goes... I'd love to get more before and after pics for my
website.


Happy trails,

&gt; Here is an odd question that I have not found a good answer to.
&gt; 
&gt; What is a good value for a nice Westfakia?  And is there a way to take a
&gt; regular transporter and cut the hole properly in the top for a pop top?
&gt; 
&gt; Here is the situation:  Parts '73 Westi with perfect interior, more rust on
&gt; the bottom that you can possible imagine.  '71 Transporter, busted engine
&gt; but good body.  Total outlay for both about $1000.
&gt; 
&gt; Figure in parts for restoration to be about $500.  My time is essentially
&gt; free.
&gt; 
&gt; If I can get a hole in the roof it would be really nice and a darn nice
&gt; camper that really you could not tell the difference...  Not that I would
&gt; defraud a buyer like that, but at the same time it does not scream Fakia!
&gt; Fakia! :)
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway lets say the hole in the roof is impossible, what would a perfect
&gt; condition westi interior in a good body go for?  I like to put them back on
&gt; the road but need some beer money at the same time!  I figure if it is worth
&gt; a solid 2000-2500 it would be worth the effort involved.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks and any insights are greatly appreciated.
