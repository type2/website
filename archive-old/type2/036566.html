Subject: Re: disintegrated needle bearing

&gt;&gt; Does anyone know what could cause this to happen to the needle bearing.
Am 
&gt;&gt; i in need of a new tranny soon???
&gt;
&gt;usually the culprit is lack of lubrication.  Be sure to lube your new
&gt;bearing with the thickest grease you can find.  I use Bosch distributor
&gt;point grease.

What causes needle bearings to fail?  I do not know, but I coasted down off
the mountains, 14+ miles in gear with engine running and clutch depressed.
After twenty minutes or so of this, and at the bottom of the hill, I could
not shift.  An hour later after everything had cooled off, I could shift
though it still did not feel just right.  Later back home, I needed a new
set of needle bearings.  Coincidence or cause-and effect?  Does anyone know.
