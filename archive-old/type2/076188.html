Subject: Hoses and confusion?

More questions as my engine goes back together.
1. Does anyone know of a link to a site with a complete schematic of ALL
the hoses and where they connect to?
2. I hope to replace all vacuum hoses, anyone have a clue as to what the
various sizes are?
3. when connecting hoses to the Y fittings and elbows (Aux. air valve)
is it wise to use some kind of sealer? If so, what do you recommend?
Thanks for all advice,
Tom
