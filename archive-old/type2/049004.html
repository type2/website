Subject: Re: [T2] cheap welder? 

Heres the one most people are refering to
http://www.lincolnelectric_dot_com/products/wprod/sp100t.asp
Called the &quot;weld-pak 100&quot; in the stores such as Home depot, although lincoln
calls it the sp-100 on their site.

&gt;I see many references to &quot;cheap&quot; $200 wire feed welders in the archives,
&gt;but cannot for the life of me find any for less than $400 which is
&gt;outside my financial scope, $200 on the other hand is within my grasp.
&gt;Can anyone tell me where these &quot;cheap&quot; welders are to be found?
