Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Line 

From: &quot;Karl&quot; &lt;aufever_at_prodigy_dot_net&gt;

&gt; &gt;From your previous message, you say you have a carb? What happened to
your fuel injection?
&gt; If you have a modified fuel system, no one can tell you what you have
unless they see it...

I'll have to take pictures, then (a digital camera is on the event horizon).

I inherited a modified setup.  Whatever the engine had originally, it now
has a single carb.  Which frankly is about my speed repair/tune up-wise, so
the loss of power/performance may be balanced out my being able to work on
the engine.

Thanks for the help.
