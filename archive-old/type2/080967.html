Subject: Re: [T2] Bus-boys ball joints

I'm no mechanic and one local repair guy says that he'd charge about as much
to install the torsion arms as to replace the ball joints. He says that's
where most of the labor is anyway.

How long did it take you guys to install the new torsion arms?

&gt; Dear List,
&gt;
&gt; I'm starting a full body transplant and the new body needs, among a
hundred
&gt; other things, all four ball joints replaced. I noticed bus-boys have ready
&gt; to go joints and torsion arms pre-pressed.
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; 211-498-101BX  Torsion Arm Set (4) Bus/Pickup 1970 to 1979  $174.95 set
PLUS
&gt; $50.00 Core Charge
&gt;
&gt; Far less expensive than my outstanding local shop. Plus, I get to do the
&gt; work. Has anyone used these and is this a good idea? Any thoughts? Is
there
&gt; another way without using a press? Heat maybe? Any thoughts appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; Thank you,
&gt; Brandt
