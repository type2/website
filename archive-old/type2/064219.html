Subject: Re: Price of a barn-door bus?

&gt;&gt;I found a barn-door panel van bus in the junk yard and am wondering what
it is 
&gt;&gt;worth if it were spotless. I also need to know the year of it. It has nipple 
&gt;&gt;type front signals, small rear window, small rear stop lights, horizontal 
&gt;&gt;cooling lines on the rear and some kind of liitle compartment or something 
&gt;&gt;between the heads of the driver and the passenger.

The fact that it has nipple turn signals and the fresh air box automatically
disqualifies it as a barndoor.  There was an optional air-scoop, aka
&quot;ambulance scoop&quot; but thats a whole different ball 'o wax..

A non-barndoor panel would be worth anywhere from $1500 to $5000k, depending
on condition
