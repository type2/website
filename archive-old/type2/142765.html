Subject: Re: [T2] Tune-up Freq with Bruck 205; Bosch Qual Decl

What exactly is failing when you have to perform a tune up again? I've
found with points that they can need adjusting that frequently,
particularly with a hotter than stock coil. I have a Pertronix on its
way...

I can vouch for Bosch's quality declining. My plug wires are corroding
at the plug end where they go into the bakelite ends. There was a
brief discussion earlier about Bosch spark plugs being made in India
and being of poorer quality than German made ones. Check your &quot;Made
In...&quot; labels and let us know.
