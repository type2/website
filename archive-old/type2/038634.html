Reality check

not saying not to do it but some other comments from an Auto tranny user
and satisfied (had 3 manuals before this one)

BTW, what year was yours, the trannies changed in 75/76,  the later ones
are &quot;less interchangeable&quot; but still doable if you really want it.

[BTW - what did you do with your auto tranny parts??]

&gt; Hey all,
&gt;  I have a first hand account of the auto to manual conversion.  It's not
&gt; that difficult ( &amp; I have a hard time ajusting valves;-)

glad someone who actually did it has chimed in, hope this message is
archived in the library.

&gt; The first thing I did was get a moderately wrecked bus that had 4 flats

try for the same year fewer problems

&gt; My reasons for the switch were :
&gt; I had always wanted a manual ( good reason to start with ;-)

only reason that is really valid

&gt; Julia &amp; I had taken the bus cross country w/ it as an automatic.  I
&gt; personally didn't care for the shifting &amp; general *feel* going up the
&gt; hills/mountains.  More than that, I didn't like the feel even more
&gt; coming down the mountains.

again I think this depends on the model tranny the later gov controlled
auto tranny seems to work fine in the mountains (OK Eastern mountains, but
I was just up in Vermont, NH and Maine)

&gt; W/the manual trans, I love winding through the mountains using the trans
&gt; as a driving tool.  Especially forest service roads, etc.  I just never

guess that has an inpact too, I live in a major big city, too much stop
and start and traffic to worry with a manual tranny

&gt; that I have re-done the entire brake system &amp; suspension system since
&gt; the std conversion, and all of that work has greatly helped the handling

that probably helped more than anything else

&gt; as well.)  Gas mileage was another point, but when it was an auto it was
&gt; also carburated.  SO, there are multiple variables to consider in each

don't think the difference is that significant

&gt; condition.  But I think that the buses were meant to be standard drives

yes they were designed as a standard and the auto tranny was an attempt to
get more of the American market where the auto tranny is more common

&gt; Pedal assembly.
&gt; Take a look at the pedal assembly.  Figure out how it fits and works (do

&gt; hole for the pedal is also there. It is just covered by a grommet (I say
&gt; this with confidence, but I have only looked at 2 autos.  Both of them
&gt; are as I describe, but I have limited experience - feedback??

yes the hole is there in all that I have ever seen and I have looked at a
lot of em

&gt; Shifter
&gt; The shifter is bolted to the floor.   The linkage for the auto is just a
&gt; cable if I remember correct.  However the tube for the manual shifter

it is a combination rod and cable.

&gt; At this point you are going to have to pull the engines &amp; trns from both
&gt; buses

getting that auto shifter out with the tranny in is a PITA if your gonna
remove the engine and tranny anyway takee em out first

&gt; Shifter linkage
&gt; Clutch cable tube
&gt; This was a problem.  I had to use a dremel, hacksaw, &amp; chisel to break
...
&gt; tube on either side of it passes through any frame hole as the new
&gt; *welds*.  I told myself that I would eventually get them welded, but

think it is a little more work than this

&gt; Accelerator cable tube
&gt; The auto accelerator cable was shorter &amp; had a connect down to the

&gt; Trans mounting.
&gt; All of the holes are the same.  Keep all of the hardware from the
&gt; manual.  I think the mounting plate at the nose cone may be slightly
nose cone is different, so get the front mounting bracket

&gt; starter from the manual.  The auto/manual starters are different &amp; not
&gt; interchangeable.  Remember the wiring, or tag it.  Bolt the clutch cable

the auto starter will go into some but not all manual trannies, and if you
can use it do so it is bigger and more powerfull and has no nose bearing
to cause problems

&gt; matching:


&gt; Then take the flange off the auto crank shaft.  put the flywheel on,

it is called a flex plate, what ever you do DON&quot;T throw away or lose the
three bolts between the flex plate and the torque converter they are
unique and no longer avaliable,  also hang onto the flex plate and torque
converter, advertise em here there are always takers for them, if not get
ahold of me !

&gt; out bearing.  You may also need to get a diferent ECU, if you have FI.  
&gt; I think there are 2 extra wires on the auto ECU.  Use the ECU from the
&gt; donor bus.

yes ECUs are different, (hang onto that ECU and swap or trade it here too)

&gt; precision skill.  Just a lot of observing &amp; visualizing how it *should*
&gt; be.  It did take me some time, but I was going through a lot of systems

take photos or video, helps jog the memory

&gt; I am exremely pleased w/the manual - 40k miles so far.
&gt; gas mileage before - auto &amp; carb - 13-14
&gt; gas mileage now - 4 spd &amp; FI  - 17-20/21 (I got 23 mpg in one 280 mile

with my stock 78 with auto tranny and FI   about 15-17 in city driving
18-19.5 or so on the interstate

&gt; I love it,
&gt; but most of all, I wanted it.
&gt; it did cost some money - but I already had too much history in that bus
&gt; to sell it &amp; buy another one just because mine was not a manual.

the only reasons that count.  I have an auto tranny and for a number of
reasons this one has been modified so that it would be next to imposible
to ever put a manual in it, and I like it and don't want to trade it or
get another, and after 8 years I know most of what is in it.  so if you or
anyone else has spare auto tranny parts for a 78 drop me a message, also
if you need a part contact me, guess I'm collecting auto trann parts


I have always felt, it is your bus, do what you want with it
