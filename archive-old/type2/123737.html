Subject: Downhill backfire pop..pop..pop..?

Hi Everyone,
 
While I was taking my family camping last week in Forrest Hill, CA,
&quot;Bess the Bus&quot; starting making some backfire type noises going downhill.
It sounded like a loud pop..pop..pop.  My wife was following me in our
other car and did not see any smoke, just heard the noise.  It seemed to
only happen downhill when the engine was compression braking.  Any
ideas?  I never get this sound driving around town, it is either a new
problem or an old one that only happens going downhill in 2nd gear.  
 
The bus never lost any power and I did not notice any hesitation in
acceleration.  Just a pop..pop...pop sound going downhill.
Thanks in advance, nothing like bus camping with the kids!
