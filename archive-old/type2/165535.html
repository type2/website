Subject: Re: [T2] spring plate bushing replacement

There are four bushings, inner and outer on each side.  That means that
the spring plate has to be removed from the hub and the torsion bar to
replace the inner bushing.

Bushing replacement is usually combined with torsion bar adjustment for
this reason.  Allow a weekend to complete the job.
