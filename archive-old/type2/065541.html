Subject: Help with my numbers

I have received a few responses guiding me in the right direction to identify
by bus. But I'm in a mental freeze and can't focus on the way the M list 
in the NEATO Homepage comes out on my system. Anyway here is an
appoximation of the way my metal tag is laid out:

25N

425  025  114

UF  2513  42178  1205857

I believe the 425 is not listed, the 025 are seatbelt anchors and 114 is for
six pop out side windows. Also my engine #0300727 I'd like to know what
size, year or any other helpfull info.

Thanks again for all the help on the other subjects I've inquired about, all
have been proving the value of this service.
