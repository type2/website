Subject: Re: Bus has trouble turning over when cold

I always thought that this was the norm?   You mean it's not suppose
to do this?


&gt; Usually it takes 2-3 tries to get it to fire, then die,  then
another couple tries after that.  After it has started, I have to keep
my foot lightly on the accelerator pedal for a few minutes until I can
release it to complete its warm up
