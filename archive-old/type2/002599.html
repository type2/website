My 77 was recently rebuilt with hydraulics by AVP. Now 4K miles later, I
wonder if they need adjusted, checked, or otherwise played with. If anyone
can offer a newbie some advice, here's some more info/questions:

I have found in the archives good articles on fixing problems with
hydraulics(thanks John Anderson), but little on routine maintenance. I
figure a check at this point couldn't hurt. When new, I had a leaky push rod
tube(my fault from exhaust installation). I took the R rocker assy off and
corrected it, then reinstalled all and off I went. I didn't adjust anything
at the time, just put it back and torqued to spec and figured all was well.
My question is: do I need to do anything or are my valves now
maintenance-free? They are not loud or anything. Also, if they do need a
check/adjustment, there seems to be controversy over hot vs cold. My theory
is that they should be &quot;pumped up&quot; and therefore I should run the bus before
getting started. Also, how often should I check them?
I am just antsy because I'm used to 8 years of rolling under the bus with
the feeler gauge. Opinions, comments, humor-at-my-expense...all is welcomed
:)
