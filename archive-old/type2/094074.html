Subject: Re: [T2] The Woes of the Fuel Filter Change

I looked at Lowes, but I did not feel comfortable about any of the options
there.  I know that the Swagelock company makes valves that are compatible
with anything.  I would like a swagelock-quality fitting on the metal tube
exiting the tank, if possible, full flow, such as a ball valve.  These are
also available with electrical actuators, but the cost is too much for me,
and the valve is probably too bulky.  I kinda like the valve shown here:

This is for a propane fueled engine, it should work for gasoline as well.
It can be wired to the ignition and to a hidden switch as a theft/teen
driver deterrent.

&gt;&gt; sure. here's what I did. Went to home depot &amp; got 2 brass shut off
&gt;&gt; ball valves. (I believe they were 1/4&quot; but may have been 3/8&quot;) I used
&gt;&gt; used hose bibb adapters to adapt the female pipe thread fitting in the
&gt;&gt; valve to the fuel line. Clamped it &amp; have been very happy since. I put
&gt;&gt; them both just out of the fuel tank. It is quite tight up there to
&gt;&gt; shut them off, but it's not exactly something I do every week. If I
&gt;&gt; can, I'll see if I can put take some pics &amp; then post them. But
&gt;&gt; essentially it was something like &lt;$20 in parts for the whole setup. I
&gt;&gt; thought about using gas valves because of the much more compact handle
&gt;&gt; but couldn't find a size that I was happy with.
&gt; 
&gt; In the dark times when the gas tank was the bane on my existence, I had one
&gt; of these valves installed between the tank and the filter.  When I
&gt; ressurrected my bus a couple of months ago I remove the valve because no
&gt; fuel was coming out and I noticed that the seal has disintegrated.
&gt; 
&gt; You can find shut off valves specifically made for fuel.  I will put one on
&gt; the next time I have to change the filter.
