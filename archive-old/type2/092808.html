Subject: Re: [T2] what happened to my Bus and a Friday thing...

Hang in there - lots of people think anything old is automatically junk!!!

What I've learned over the years is that lots of new things are worse than 
the old versions.

Lot's of old things aren't any less efficient than their modern cousins 
too....

Learn to work on it and any old vehicle will do it's job. It's just things 
that wear out 'cause they are old or neglected...

Just think what 6 years with a 20 year old VW bus costs you and what a 5 
year car loan on a new car every 7 years or so costs you...

I'll keep my '99 CR-V for at least 300-350K miles.

Many folks think they are buying a new car - what they are really buying is 
a car payment...

Keep that old VW and take care of it. It will take care of you too.
