Subject: Re: [T2] 3 fuse box relays?

On 7/5/03 9:09 AM, &quot;KYLE LAFERRIERE&quot; &lt;klaferriere_at_msn_dot_com&gt; wrote:

&gt; I have a third relay on my fuse box. It is smaller than the one for the
&gt; dimmer and the one for the turnsignals/flashers. It is located on the
&gt; passenger side of the fuse box. It appears to be one space over from the
&gt; end. Out of this relay comes a gray wire and a gray wire with a black
&gt; stripe. One of the wires goes up into a big sheathed bundle. The other is
&gt; attached to the relay, but not at the other end.
&gt; Does any one know what this relay is for and where the other end of the wire
&gt; should go.

It's the door buzzer. It goes off when the key is inserted and the door is
opened.

The gray/black wire goes to a terminal on the ignition switch hence the
bundle. The grey wire goes to the black contact switch in the door-jam. When
the switch is closed it grounds the circuit and the buzzer goes waaaah.
