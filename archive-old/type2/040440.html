Subject: too much oil #1 - long

I was returning home (Northern VA) from Myrtle Beach this past Sunday
and topped off my oil during a gas stop.  Oil level on dipstick was
about 1/5 the way above lower mark.  Thinking of quarts as pints, I put
about 1.25 - 1.5 pints in at this point.

About 35 minutes down the road, cruising around 63 mph, the green light
begins to flicker.  Having read many posts where this resulted from a
defective oil pressure sending unit and having had the wire come off and
ground to engine on another occasion, I was complacent and waited until
the next exit.

When I let off the gas in service station parking lot the green light
came on steady.  Killed engine, coasted to stop and when I checked the
engine compartment, oil was everywhere, dripping from everywhere and
nowhere to found on dipsick.  Engine did not appear excessively hot - no
steam/smoke and dipsick was not particularly not.  A visual inspection
found the case and pushrod tubes, etc. - all intact.

Muir says overfill = blown main seal.

Tow truck home.  225 miles and $250 later see #2.
