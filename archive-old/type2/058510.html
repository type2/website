Subject: RE: battery tray and more.

Steve an all,
   I have to do this sometime this winter. My idea was to cut out the
bad
metal lay down a ring of RTV type sealer covered by a cut to fit sheet
of
aluminum,,,I was going to use rivets. The sealer + rivets would make it
pretty
tight,,,,I know this isnt a restoration fix but I am more interested in
stopping the
rust and makeing sure my battery stays off the road. Any comments? I too
would like to see how the welding is done,,being a welder impaired type.

&gt; I'd love to see someone do a similar write-up for Battery Tray
&gt; replacement.
&gt; I'm curious how the welding is done, how you cut close to the main
&gt; body
&gt; walls, etc.

	Why not a stock 1800 w/duals like a 74?

&gt; Now heres my problem they are all trying to get me to
&gt; install a 1776? motor in the bus. I have a solid stock 1600 that I was
&gt; just
&gt; going to overhaul into a 1650. Now my question is which would be
&gt; better for a
&gt; everyday to work and beach hopefully low maitnence bus.

	I had a 80 van-o-gone and my 74 runs much stronger, though the
top end
	on the 80 was higher (or so I think). The bus is
smaller/lighter,,,I think that
	is the big thing. I could never get the 80 to run like I thought
it should.

&gt; We've gone on trips this summer with both vans, and have
&gt; found that the 73 consistently runs away from the 82 on a long hill.
