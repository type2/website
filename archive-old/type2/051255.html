Hello list, I am new here, this being my first post, so if I breach
ettiquete, I invite you to tell me what I did wrong, THEN flog me with a
fan belt.

I am purchasing a 1973 VW Safare Camper van for $1500. Its in really
great shape, with all the camping gear and interior intact, even the
original hotpot hanging over the sink as seen in the owners manual. I
was just wondering if anyone had any info they would care to share about
these ugly ducklings of the vw bus world. This is the model that has the
high camper roof, not a pop-top. They were aftermarket conversions made
in Paramount, Southern California. I have &quot;heard&quot; there were only around
1000 made, is this true? I have scoured vw books at Barnes and Nobles,
but there is no mention of this style, and no mention of the
Adventurewagen,  which is very similiar in design.

Let me know what you folks know,

Thanks,

tObi
