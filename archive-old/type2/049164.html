Subject: [T2] A Question On Carbs.

Hi Volks,
   My 71 bus came from the PO with a Bocar 30pict-1 carb installed on a 
1600DP engine.  The Bentley manual calls for a Solex 34pict-3.  I have the 
chance to buy a 34pict-3 in rebuildable condition for a good price.
   My question is, will I have any real world differences by doing this carb 
change?  Of course the -3 would be rebuilt first.
   Thanks in advance for your help, and have a good holiday season, 
whichever holiday you call your own.
