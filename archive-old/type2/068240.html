Hi folks,

Speaking of type I style heat exchanger flaps...I've never purchased a new
heat exchanger, but I seem to recall from somewhere that when new, the valve
itself is covered in a rubber/plastic disk to make a good seal.  Looking at
the front of my exchangers into the heat outlet, I see that mine only have
the metal valve with no cover so I assume either some didn't come with this
or the rubber disintigrates and &quot;disappears&quot; over time.

To get to the valve you'd have to disassemble the flapper box anyhow so it
would probably not be worth the bother to repair (and besides, the heat leak
would be so miniscule I wouldn't think it would be relevant).   I'm just
curious if these items are even available or if someone can come up with a
justification for installing them :).
