Subject: [T2] Air and water

from &quot;Volkswagens of the World&quot; (Simon Glen) ISBN 1-901295-61-3: there was
a 1980 - 1983 VW Gol in Brazil (looks similar in size and shape as a Fox or
the early Polo; described in the book as a mix between Golf and Scirocco
but somewhat smaller) which had a front engine and was aircooled: in the
begin only 1300 cc, later up to 1600cc, twin carburator. In 1984 a new
watercooled 1600 cc was introduced. The 1600 cc aircooled engines were
phase out in 1987.

...
&gt;I'd never heard of an aircooled Fox. But the origin of the Fox is not
&gt;Brazilian. ....
