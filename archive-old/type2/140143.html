Subject: 1973 Bus - how to tell which carb is installed?

Hi,



I'm interested to change or rebuild the Weber single carb on my '73 bus.  It
works very well, but when engine is off and I give gas I can see it dripping
fuel.  This seems dangerous, and I feel it is not normal.  The question is :
how do I know which type of carb is installed for ordering replacement
parts?



My carb says &quot;Weber&quot; on it, and as mentioned above it is a single carb.  For
sake of easy installation, I'd like to go ahead and re-install the same
model carb, or else rebuild the current one that's on.  Does anyone know
which model this is?  If necessary I can snap photos and put them online.



All help identifying which 'carb' I've got is much appreciated.  Also please
advise if it's normal for fuel to leak from any carb while giving gas w/
engine off.



Thanks,

Shawn
