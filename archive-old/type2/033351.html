Subject: Cylinder Head Temp

Volks,
   I have a '79 bus 2.0L FI w/CA emissions. The motor is rebulit and has
about 2K miles on it. I installed a cylinder head temp sensor on #3 cylinder
and the temp reads about 350 deg on a no load drive (flat surface doing
55-60 MPH), but when I put a load (uphill) doing about 65-70 MPH the temp
jumps up to 425-475 deg. I think its running hot, so I installed two mesa
oil coolers and a oil temp sensor and the oil temp reads between 180 and
200. I had two mech. look at the cooling tins and fuel injection mixture and
was told everything looks ok. Does anybody have any ideas how to lower the
cylinder head temp. I actaully thought about removing the cooling flat on
the #3 and #4 cylinder head since I have 2 external oil coolers. Thanks in
Advance.
