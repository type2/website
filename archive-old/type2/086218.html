Subject: Re: [T2] Do you have bright headlights?

Hi Dallas,

While I wasn't at Everybus, I have bright headlights -- bright enough to get 
a flash from oncoming traffic now and then on very dark roads.  I've been 
running H-4 lights, without a relay, and I love them.  The low beams have a 
sharp cutoff so as not to blind other drivers, and the high beams are like 
daylight.  Power draw isn't bad, and replacing bulbs is pretty easy.

If memory serves, they run about $20 per unit from the Bus Depot.
Get some and fear the night no more!
