I believe he added a 'pull wire' to the rear hatch so he can open it from
the inside.
There are 2 different rear hatch latches for 67-70. A bus one and a camper
one. The camper one has a sliding knob on the inside. This allows you the
option of locking the pushbutton from the inside so no one can open the
hatch from the outside, even with a key. Climb in back, pull hatch closed,
slide knob down. Instead of having to go outside and lock it with the key
and then climb back in thru the front. The inner hatch panel on a bus having
this style latch has a large upside-down V cut in it. This gives you finger
room to pull the lever to open the hatch.
Not sure if it is made for your 71.....I know part # 211 829 211G fits 67 to
70 [7/70]   I believe 8/70 [71's] and up use a different latch.
Unfortunately, when VW makes a part No Longer Available in the latest parts
list, they also drop the part # &lt;grrh&gt;  67-70 without the lever is # 211 829
211D.

&gt; I have a 71 Westy and there is no way that it can be opened from the
&gt; inside.  Are there different versions of the rear hatch lock?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Fortunately, no such problem exists with the rear hatch, which can
&gt; &gt;be unlocked
&gt; &gt;from inside regardless of the keyed status. Good for me, bad for
&gt; &gt;transporting
&gt; &gt;curious kiddos in my 71 (which has yet to happen).
