Subject: Bus Tee shirts

If anyone is looking for a neat bus tee shirt I bought my son one this 
weekend at a shop called &quot;Loose Lucy's&quot; in Hilton Head SC.  They had a micro 
bus cut in half inside the store on display, I thought what a loss.  

They have a web site www.looselucys_dot_com.  I checked out this site they offer 
three bus tee shirts but I did not see the one I bought.  I thought the one I 
bought was better than what's on the site.  They have lots and lots of  
&quot;Deadhead&quot; hippie type stuff.

I'm not affiliated with the store in any way. Just thought I'd pass it on.
