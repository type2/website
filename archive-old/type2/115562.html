Subject: AFM: pins 6 and 27

I want to dismantle my AFM and see why my resistance between pins 6 and 27 are
off. The bible says they should read between 2k-3k ohms. Unfortunately mine
reads 1.8k. Somebody was nice to remind me that specs are specs for a reason.
So now.. I want to see where these two wires go underneath the plate inside
the box, but have doubts if it's worth toying with since I can't seem to see
where they go underneath the plate. Does anybody have any good suggestions as
to how to begin to dismantle my AFM, or a schematic just to see where they
lead to.?
Brief History..Yesterday I noticed these two wires were green with oxidization
and I was getting an open reading on my ohm meter. In fact, the whole time I
owned the van (May) everytime I turned the key ON my fuel pump would start. I
didn't know any different, since this is my first FI. After rewiring the
connector and cleaning them up, my pump doesn't come on anymore. After doing
some investigating, I began to realize that this is normal. BUT&gt;&gt;&gt; Specs are
specs...and I would like to see what the wires look like from under the
surface. Help...please .

P.S. Sorry for another AFM question..but I honestly searched and searched
type2.
