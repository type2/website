Subject: RE: New lister-looking for seals

&gt;Does anyone know of a source for the fresh air flap seals that
&gt;mount on the
&gt;front of the bus, behind the grill, just under the windshield?

While this isn't stock, I used some 1/2&quot; x 3/16&quot; soft, closed cell foam,
weather trim on mine and it has worked great for three years now. I cut the
radius of the corners in the foam and pieced it together instead of trying
to bend the foam around the corner. This way the foam held it's shape over
time and the seal remained constant. BTW there is an adjusting mechanism
between the flap and the lever that allows for variations in seal thickness.
