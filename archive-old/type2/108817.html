Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Pump Studs Length?

&gt; Okay so I know its a long shot here but does anyone know the length of the
 OEM 8mm oil pump studs on a type IV? I am going to be replacing my pump and
 will need slightly longer studs. Actually about 7mm longer, and I want to
 get them before I start this job.
 
Near as I can tell, they appear to be part # N014 443 12 which are 8 x 38
