Subject: clock substitute found

well, while looking through the local junkyard
yesterday in the rain (25% rain discount, no kidding)
i was buying a later model dash panel with the
lightable heat and defrost labels i decided to go
looking for clocks.  i found what looked to be a nice
vdo out of a mercedes but found it to be broke when i
got it home.  if i could have figured out a proper way
to disassemble it i could have probably saved it.  i
also found a clock that looked rather nice out of a Z
car.  it slips right into the clock hole in the dash
from the rear and i just put some epoxy in 4 small
places to hold it in though you could probably make a
nice holder out of some metal tape and use the stock
screws.  anyway, it is very quiet and i wasn't quite
sure it was even working until i let it run for a
while and it was keeping perfect time.  it is also lit
very nicely so should be a nice addition to the bus
who has no name as of yet.
