Chris &amp; List:

On a '78 (manual transmission) there are two small vacuum lines.  One
emanates from the throttle valve and goes to a Tee near the distributor,
and provides vacuum to the distributor vacuum advance diaphragm and also
to the EEC cutoff valve that's located in the air cleaner housing.  The
second small vacuum line comes off the intake air distributor between
the runners to cylinders 1&amp;2, runs down to a Tee near the fuel pressure
regulator, applies vacuum to the fuel pressure regulator and via the Tee
branches up to also provide vacuum to the decel valve.
