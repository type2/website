Subject: Re: [T2] engine number confusion

[...]

[...]

&gt; I received my birth certificate from the wolfsburg museum yesterday for my
&gt; $500 '79 camper and was pleasantly surprised to discover that it still has
&gt; the original engine in it!  I'm confused on one issue, though.   The engine
&gt; code is GE and everything I'm reading in the type II library indicates that
&gt; it's a California model.  However, the emission sticker on the engine lid
&gt; does not indicate that it meets California standards.  There is no
&gt; reference to California anywhere.  The camper was originally imported to
&gt; the port in Jacksonville, Fla and from what I can determine finding scraps
&gt; of paper in it where it was sold one or two times, it spent most of its
&gt; life in the southeast.  Am I missing something here?

I am not sure where someone came up with the idea that GE is a 1979 California
engine. I have seen that at 2 places. It is totally wrong. GE means it has
hydraulic lifters. Hydraulic lifters came out in 1978. These are all GE
engines, along with all USA 79 engines. I know one of the places that shows
this false info is here:   http://tunacan_dot_net/t4/reference/case.htm
