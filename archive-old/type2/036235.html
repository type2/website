 Hi volks,

 (just back from holiday in Canada: saw a nice looking '71 westy in
Vancouver
on Saturday morning, BTW. It was darkish red: on the list?).

&gt; The Porsche alloys are 5 lug and are very close, but I was told they
are
&gt; slightly off and would not work on a bus without modifications.

 Porsche 5-lug wheels generally run a 130mm pcd, compared to 112mm for
a bus. The &quot;telephone dial&quot; style fitted to 944s came in different
offsets (I think 1987 was the year they changed).

 I understood the main purpose of &quot;cross drilled&quot; discs was to allow
gas from the pads expansion room, when conditions get severe enough to
require it. &quot;Vented&quot; discs improve cooling, in an attempt to keep
brake temperatures down. In a heavily loaded van a long descent will
exceed the capacity of the brakes and lead to fade, my response would
be to take the descent more slowly (if possible) or to stop and let
the discs cool.
 Ultimately, if you're doing this frequently, I'd have to suggest a
bigger van: the load capacity of a baywindow is only about a tonne
(1200kg for a &quot;heavy duty&quot; model, ISTR). 

Cheers,
	W.
