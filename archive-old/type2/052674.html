&gt; This is the piece that is at (some people say) the FRONT of the engine,

&gt; point fpr air that goes past the oil cooler element).
&gt;
&gt; By looking at the last one I've seen, it must also have the &quot;added on&quot; sheet
&gt; metal that gives it more the &quot;square with rounded corners&quot; than the
&gt; parabolic (bug) profile.

Michael:
I'm about 98% certain that all VW did was use a bug piece and then spotweld on
an adapter to make it fit the bigger type 2 front opening. What this means is
that you could find a similar part from a 68,69 or 70, cut off the adapter with
a hammer and chisel and attach it to the appropriate bug piece with the opening
for the doghouse cooler either by welding or pop rivets.
I'm planning on putting a dual port engine in my 69 double cab, so I'm trying to
work out all the parts I'm going to need for this conversion.
