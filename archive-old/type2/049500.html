Subject: [T2] Them there hills, this here bus.

Hey.
So, I'm thinking way in advance here, but I might be going to work in
Colorado this summer for about two months.  I hear there's two or three
little hills around there.

    So, here's my question.  Do I drive an automatic, or a standard?
I'm scared to take my standard on any hills around here, because I don't
want to stall it and roll backwards into other cars.  That's like, my
worst fear.
    On the other hand, I hear the automatics suck, and might not pull me
up the hill.  (also, do autos fail a lot?  I don't want to be driving
cross country and be stuck because i drove an automatic bus.)

    So, let me know what you think.

Thanks,
