I'm looking for thoughts and suggestions and most of all, good guesses.

My 72 that I just bought had been sitting for a few years.  It had a tune up
right before it was parked.  Anyhow, I drained the fuel lines and put a new
battery in.  The first couple of attempts to start it, it tried to turn over.
Now, when I turn the key, nothing.  Not even a click to let me know it's
attempting to start.  My red lights come on at the half turn of the key but
nothing when I turn it over fully.  I've done the whole screwdriver across the
solenoid bolts and it whirrs great. Any ideas on how to get this baby started?
Shots in the dark are more than welcome.

Thanks for helping out a beginner,

Paul
