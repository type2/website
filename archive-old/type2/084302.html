Subject: Re: [T2] Subject: Modern Brake Switch

Hey, a$$holes, start out 10 minutes early and enjoy the ride!!!! Thats
what I do, in our little Jetta Diesel(53 bhp!) ! The other people who
consider the public roads their personal racecourses or place to get out
their frustrations about how much they hate their lives don't really
have too much to do with my life being the true rednecks they are.... Ne
illegitimus carborundum!Andy, I'm gonna have my Bus('77 T'porter) on the
road this autumn and expect to have more encounters of the fourth
kind(G!), but I will not be intimidated, either.

Chris in South Carolina.

PS: Andy, I was born and raised in Miami, just 4 blocks from Jackson
Memorial Hospital, 10th ave. and 14terr. Lived there for 16 years and
moved to Miami Springs when My ma sold our house. I haven't been back
since 1977 and what I saw then was enough to keep me  out for good. Good
Luck!

&gt; &gt; Sadly, I must reply that this approach is no longer very effective out here in the Greater Seattle/Puget Sound area.  It might even get you shot...
&gt; &gt; Around here, driving in the curb lane of a city arterial at _ONLY_ 5 MPH over the posted limit will get you deluged with &quot;negative feedback&quot;.
&gt; &gt; Comments in casual conversation along the lines of &quot;...and the SOB refused to drive more than [5, 10, any number will do] MPH over the limit, and he/she made me late for...&quot; are common in gatherings at any level of society, polite or otherwise.
&gt; &gt; It's my experience that VW buses may receive a slightly higher level of tolerance in this regard from drivers of sedans, etc.  But drivers of SUVs, especially those newly transitioned from mini-vans, seem to operate in a constant state of irritation at other drivers/vehicles including VW buses.
