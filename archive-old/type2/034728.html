Subject: Re: Anyone buy the Bus Depot Stainless Exhaust?

I bought the Stainless muffler from Bus Depot about two months ago. I
have about 300 miles on it now. I have nothing to compare it to because
I had never driven my bus with any other type muffler. I can say I do
like it and I seam to have good power. The outside paint has started to
burn off revealing the stainless steal already. As for the fit I had no
problems what so ever, this was my first type 4 build up from a long
block. The exhaust pipe is not stainless and has Brazil stamped on it,
it is a Kadron but seams to be doing fine so far. The gaskets between
the heater boxes and the mufflers also seams to fit good, I have no leak
around them.
Hope this helps, I think the money for the Stainless one will pay off in
the long run.
