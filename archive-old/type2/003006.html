I beg to differ on the 914 vs. bus 2.0 engines. The heads are the major
difference where the bus has a 4 bolt intake manifold and 3 on 914, also the
914 has the spark plugs angled differently so your bus tin covers for the
heads won't fit properly without modification. Lots of little differences,
like different oil filler, sodium valves etc. Just wanted to clarify in case
someone thought it was a straight bolt in affair.
