Subject: Re: Where would you go in your VW? &lt;a friday question&gt;

So Rusty VanBondo says:
&gt; 
&gt; Where would you like to be able to drive your favorite VW if given the time,
&gt; health, and a modest budget. Who would you take along and why? What vehicle
&gt; would you take?

Well... I plan to take just such a trip in either Fall of '98 or Spring of '99
That's when I get my second sabbatical from Intel.  I was planning on spending
a month touring the country.  Linda will come along if her job permits.  We'll
be doing some kind of loop through the South making a detour around Dallas 
(Don't want to get to close to the Schwarzmeister) ;)   Then drive further 
east and do an even larger detour around Alabama. (Need you ask?) ;) :) :)
Okay, so the rest of the trip would take us to Florida and up the Eastern
seaboard, well, assuming it's still there considering all the Hurricanes
that seem to be fond of that area lately.   I'd like to go all the way
into Maine and Canada, but that will depend on how much time we have.  Check
out the Great Lakes.  I don't know whether or not I'd want to continue on
the Canadian side or head down to St. Louis.  The Mid-West can be somewhat
boring, but again, time may be a factor.  I've been up the Pacific Coast
Highway, which is a definite &quot;must see&quot; for those of you who've never been.
That drive was made for VW Campers.  North-bound anyway. ;)  So that last
part of the trip will take us either through the Rockies/Colorado/Utah area
or.... In Canada through the western provinces and Washington State, Oregon
and home.  The last part of the trip will probably be done a break-neck speed
because we'll be home-sick and tired of driving, but who knows?  Coming home
usually means going back to work, so maybe that'll balance out the last part
of the journey.  :)
