I didn't know this.  I was cutting my own.

&gt; New screens are available (111 209 147A for buses up to
&gt; '74), however the ones I've seen have a cork piece inserted on the
inside,
&gt; top part of the screen, presumeably to prevent it from collapsing. 
None of
&gt; the original screens I've removed from tanks had this cork (nor have
I seen
&gt; a collapsed original screen), so either they weren't present
originally or
&gt; they disintegrated and the fragments of cork were collected in the
fuel
&gt; filter.  Maybe this is why George is recommending reusing the
original screen?

Nope, I'm just cheap.  I've never checked on the availability of new
screens as the old ones have always been in good shape and I have a
few spares from the wrecking yard.

I'm not too thrilled with the idea of having cork on the engine side
of the screen.  Seems like a problem waiting to happen!
