i've got pretty much the whole inside of my bus stripped. the only thing
left to remove at this point is the rear cabinet, but that shouldn't take
long.

next step is to really scrub the hell out of it, and get rid of those 28
years of built-up grime in the nooks and crannies. Hopefully i'll get that
all done by this evening, and i can spend tomorrow wire-brushing down the
10 billion little tiny surface rust spots and hitting them with some primer
and rustoleum before i bring the bus up to VT to rubberize it.

the old floor consisted of some 1/4&quot; plywood, carpet padding, brown
carpeting and lots of glue. a good chunk of the side panel opposite the
sliding door, and the plywood on the floor near it, were rotted completely
through and smell just awful. my vent window doesn't close correctly, and
it looks like moisture is getting in there and making everything soggy.
gotta deal with that soon.

as for the floors, i'm starting to think that putting down more plywood
might not be such a great idea, in case leaks like this ever happen again.
it'll just sponge it up until a rust hole forms. So, aside from 5 or 6
coats of polyeurothane on the plywood subfloor, anyone have suggestions for
other materials? do you think i even need to put anything down underneath
the carpet and padding [yeah, i know - the padding is a sponge, too] or are
the ridges in the floor going to feel weird if i don't have something
smooth on them?

i forgot the digital camera at work, but hopefully i'll have some pictures
up on the web to show how it's progressing. i'd like to have this thing all
insulated and ready for the cold before it's cold. which is basically now,
making me really motivated to finish up!
