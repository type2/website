Subject: Re: [T2] Headlight aimers - not 90 degree angle on garage
  doors?

 &gt;So I have a garage, but my driveway points down at an angle to the garage
doors. Will this make any difference to the adjusting I do?

You could do it but the surface you are shining the headlights onto would 
need to be perpendicular to the driveway to get the measurements right. It 
would be easier to find somewhere like a carpark that is reasonably 
horizontal and do the adjustment there.

 &gt;For some reason, it's 5:30 and my brain is shutting down. ???

That's what the other side of the world is for! It's only midday here!

Cheers,

Martin
