Hey Volks!
The clutch just went on my '70 bus,so I guess now is the best time
to rebuild the engine since it'll have to come out anyways.The engine
in her now is a '74 Type1 1600cc.Is there anything I could do to 
this engine to give her more power but still keep her fairly simple and 
stock,or would it be better to just go for a bigger VW engine from a 
later '70's bus?I want to be able to get up hills on the highway at a 
somewhat normal speed(ie.-not 40mph).Would modifying the Type1 make her 
go faster or would a real Type2 one be better?

Almost forgot!-Does anyone have an opinion on what company makes the 
best clutch?

Thanks and Peace!
Alexis and Butterfly('70 camper)
