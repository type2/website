Subject: Re: [T2] New 71, coupla issues

Review the distributor and carb articles in the
type2_dot_com library.  One discusses all that you need to
check before assuming that your distributor needs to
be replaced, but the same holds true for the carb. 
Ie, cracked manifold boots or other sources of vac
leak must be checked.

&gt; I just picked up a new '71 Westy over the weekend,
&gt; great shape, complete rebuild, minimal rust etc. 
&gt; However, when the guy delivered it, I noticed it was
&gt; idling a little fast. It has the dreaded 009 dizzy
&gt; w\34pict3 carb.  Anyway, I set the timing and tried
&gt; to adjust the idle with the carb screws and found
&gt; that when I had the carb adjusted to about the right
&gt; idle speed, the rpms seemed to speed up and slow
&gt; down on its own will occasionally.  I fear I may
&gt; need a new carb.  Anyone got any advice??
