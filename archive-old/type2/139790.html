&gt; I picked up some reflective tape from Wally World the other day.  It was on
&gt; mark-down sale, so they may be discontinuing it.  I got some white and some
&gt; red.  I plan on adding the white along the front and back on the bulge
&gt; (what's the proper name for that belt around the bus anyway).  Not sure what
&gt; to do with the red yet.

my bus is two toned white top/blue lower,  I used the red tape to seperate
the colors...(ok so it is technically red/white/blue)
