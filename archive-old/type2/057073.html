Subject: A New Bus Fan, and Belly Pans.....

Volks:
Welcome into the world the newest VW bus fan: Samuel Henry Brooks, born to
John Brooks (of the list, kinda) and my wonderful sister Beth.  He comes
to the world with a loving uncle, a terrific set of parents, and a sage
green Westy in the side yard.  Those who have corresponded with Brooks
over the years might want to send him a note
(broooks_at_att.world_dot_net)...also...(bus content here) 
Gumby the Wonderbus is now wearing a new splash pan which the
aforementioned Mr. Brooks made out of fiberglass molded from an extremely
clean original (looked brand new) pan.  It's sprayed black, and fits
(holes and all) perfectly where it should.  If you need one (and you want
to help my nephew get to college) send Brooks an e-mail...i'm telling
you..it's hot stuff in its shiny blackness under the bus...
Since I'm coming to BBTA (although Brooks and Beth are begging off for
some reason) I may be able to bring some with we...I think the selling
price will be in the $30 to $50 dollar range...but these never rust babies
are worth it, being lovingly (and stinkingly) hand crafted out of the
finest of American fiberglass...
