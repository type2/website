Sounds like the &quot;Temp Sensor 2&quot; might be bad.  It's the one that lives on top
of the haed on cyl. #3.  Tells the ECU how warm the engine is.  Might want to
take your Ohmmeter and check it.  Don't have my Bentley handy, but I think
that it should be around 2k ohms cold and decreasing to around 600 ohms warm. 
Maybe someone could check those values...

&gt; I've been all over the archives and the library looking for info and
&gt; this has been very helpful. I've arrived at the point that the engine
&gt; finally runs ...sort of.... It used to work well for about 15 minutes
&gt; and then, when warm, would pull all kinds of hijinx including rough
&gt; idle, stalling hesitation...you get the picture. So, I followed standard
&gt; procedures, checking the coils, rotor distributor....did a valve
&gt; adjustment..all the things I'd do short of carb work since of course
&gt; there isn't one on &quot;Ellie&quot;. She now runs ...with too fast an idle and
&gt; waaaaay too rich. As per the archives and library I've done the
&gt; requisite checks as described in the troubleshooting article. All to no
&gt; avail..which leads me to what seems to be a clear picture of what's
&gt; happened to this bus in her lifetime, namely that instead of doing the
&gt; proper maintenance the PO took the easy way out and adjusted rough
&gt; running first with the idle speed screw, secondly with the throttle
&gt; linkage, and last with the mixture idle control in the air flow
&gt; meter......
