Subject: Re:poor milage in a FI 75 using 77 FI parts

Steve posted getting about 4-5 mpg below the norm for his 75 -but then
mentioned it had a 77 FI put in-

I have a 75 bus and was considering using a 78 FI harness and parts as
the 75 is lacking a temp sensor in the AFM that the later ones use, as
well as a goofy throttle switch.  However, I was advised it will not
match the capacity- ie the AFM is set for a 2000cc engine and the 75 for
1800, so it would run rich, giving signals for more gas based on the AFM
vane position?  The builder who wanted to use the 78 stuff said the AFC
injection would just give the right gas for the air being sucked?  Any
more list expert replies?.
