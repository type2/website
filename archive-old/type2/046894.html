Subject: [T2] Throttle Valve Positioner

Greetings All!

Once again I turn to the Almighty List in hopes of advice about the 
mysterious world of busses.
70 Bus.  Pretty much stock, 1600 SP, 30/31.  My Throttle Valve Positioner 
(TVP) is sitting on the left hand side of my engine compartment, very much an 
orphan.  The PO had (apparently) disconnected it when he installed a Weber.  
That carb was pretty well shot when I got the bus and I installed the 30/31.  
Question:  Can I somehow again hook up the TVP?  Or, would I even want to do 
that?  You see, I do have a muffler backfire on decompression.  I know that 
the TVP is supposed to help prevent just that situation.  By the way, I do 
also have an exhaust leak which is, in all liklihood, contributing to the 
backfire problem.  
So...............whaddyall think?  About the TVP, that is.
