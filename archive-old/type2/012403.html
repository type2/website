X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Jan said:
&gt;I believe the difference is not so much the voltage 
(although it is true
what you write about currents etc) but the fact that
380 
(or 220 in your
case) is a 3-phase supply which gives a smoother DC
current 
for welding.

+++++++++++++

Not true--most 220 volt services are single phase, not
three phase.  however, most households do have 220
volt service which is used for electric ranges,
clothes dryers, water heaters, and other energy hogs.
