Subject: re:  Make your bus tax deductible (fairly long)

We are using our Bus for our business.  In the US, the tax situation is not
quite so simple. There are two methods to claim a business deduction:
tracking all of your actual costs (complete with receipts) or using the
government's 31 cent per mile deduction (this amount was reduced in 1999
due to lower fuel costs).  In either method, you must account for miles
driven on business versus personal miles.  Commuting is not considered a
business use.  You can only deduct the business use portion of your miles.
Of course, many folks commit tax fraud by claiming personal miles as
business miles.  If the IRS ever asks them how they get to work, they could
be in for some big trouble!

The other issue to consider is insurance.  It usually costs more to insure
a vehicle if it is to be used for business.  If you don't have a business
use clause in your policy, you may find yourself out of luck if you have an
accident while using your Bus on a business trip.

By the way, I think that a VW Bus is an excellent business vehicle if you
are trying to promote your business locally.  Very few cars get as much
attention!
