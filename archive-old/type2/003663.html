Back when I started subscribing to this list, it came over a teletype
machine. We didn't have no fancy, schmancy computers. Used to be when one
buser needed to communicate with another, they'd overfill their crankcase
with oil, hold a blanket over the tail pipe and send smoke signals.

How long ago was that? 1995 or so (I think). I remember Bob Hoover's
exploits with Gretchen (or was it Gertrude?) as it was happening. Hell,
raise your hand if you even remember when Bob Hoover posted to this list.
Yeah, that's what I thought. Buncha newbies.

What's all this got to do with the price of Taiwanese points in China? Well,
way back in those days there used to be something called the Air Cooled
Search &amp; Rescue squad. This noble band of gentlemen and gentlewomen made it
their honor-bound duty to seek out and rescue air-cooled buses that were on
the verge of destruction. We've all seen them: the faded-orange '77 with
weeds growing up through the pop top, the early loaf bespoiled by Dead
stickers mouldering forlornley in some farmer's field, the splitty up to its
axles in mud. We've seen them, but how many of us have stepped up to the
plate and done something about saving them? They ain't making any more ya
know.

In the spirit of the late, great ACS&amp;R squad I made a roadtrip today. I
ducked the boss' evil eye, put my phone on hold, and lit out across
Alligator Alley, deep into the Florida Everglades. The sky was the color of
Wedgewood, the horizon nearly endless, the temperature hovering around 90F.
Not a problem. I rolled down the windows and let the breeze blow my hair
back. It feels damn good to get out of the utterly citified environs of
South Florida every now and again. And If you've never been there, the
Everglades are much more than a smelly swamp. But I digress.

A friend had tipped me to the sad plight of an '78 Westy, orange in color,
State Road 29 10 miles south of I-75 near the
not-quite-big-enough-to-be-a-town town of Jerome. (Where's Jerome? Halfway
between nowhere and Everglades City, silly.) I'm a sucker for these stories,
never mind that I have a '70 bus in storage in Wisconsin that I can't get to
because I ain't got no vacation time. And a Karmann Ghia that sits in my
garage unused because I ain't got no time at all.

Eighty-seven miles from Fort Lauderdale I found the bus. Ladies and
gentlemen, it cries out for a savior. Kind of a sad story, too. It sits at a
salvage yard that at best must attract three customers a day, due to the
remote location. The guy who runs the yard works for the Collier County
Sheriff's Department. It seems he was working the day the bus' owner got
arrested (on what charges I don't know). The salvage guy bought the bus from
the newly minted criminal, who obviously was in a hurry because he left his
clothes, camping gear, pots and pans, stereo, skateboard. There's even a
half-empty pack of smokes on the dash, Marlboro I think.

The salvage guy will let it go for $400. I bet you could get it for $300.
The drawback, and it's a big one, is there is no title. Which means the
buyer must either part it out or get a new title. In Florida you're looking
at $350.

It's a southern bus, because other than the usual windshield lip rust it's
very clean. Front axle is nice. Tires are nice. All camping gear intact.
Interior is grungy-but-servicable. Top has a serious case of blackening.
Engine looks clean, clean oil. I didn't get to start it because the battery
was dead. The FI is gone, replaced by a Weber progressive. No engine seal
(God I hate to see that, especially in Florida). The salvage guy says it
runs great, for what that's worth.

If I had the time I'd buy it, clean it up, drive it up north and sell the
damn thing. No 78 up there is this rust-free. If anyone is looking for a
cheap project, or a parts bus, p-mail me and I'll (reluctantly) give out the
details. Seriously, if I didn't live in an apartment I would have brought
the thing home. But then again, I'm always bringing home strays.
