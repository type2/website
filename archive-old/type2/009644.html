 From: Pedro P.Vivas: 

 Dear friends at the Bus Boys:
 
 Do you have the adjustable kit for the front bean and rear in your
catalog?.  I
 recently requested one and I´m just expecting to see if you have it there.
 I
 also intend to lower my transporter but last week I went to the beach and
 wished for a moment to have the van 4 to 5 in ches up in stead of down.   
does your kit also permits to be used to raise it?.
 
 Thanks for your comments.
 
 Regards,
 Pedro/
 
 73 Transporter.
