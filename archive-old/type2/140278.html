Subject: Re: [T2] Alternator questions

From deedeebus:

I am in the process of (among other repairs) replacing the alternator in my
'73 bus.  Remember I'm the one whose alternator - starter wire fried.   I
have the alternator out, it was tested A-OK, so now I need to put it back
in.

I have a couple of questions.

 Bartnik (in his Alternator Replacement article) says:

 &quot;Now pull that tin piece off as well as the plastic ring around the
alternator that's behind the tin. If you are missing the plastic ring, you
should get another one. It helps to seal around the alternator. If you don't
have it, your engine could be running hot.&quot;

 ??  I've got no plastic ring, and I've asked several parts places and they
say they've never heard of it.  Anybody have a part number on that sucker?
Or another name?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Only 1 ring is still available, depending on the tin you have.

K. 021-119-281U Alternator Coverplate, Used 1972 to 1974  CALL

K. 022-119-281 Alternator Coverplate, New 1972 to 1979  $21.11

K. 022-119-281U Alternator Coverplate, Used 1972 to 1979  CALL

Note: When using the 022-119-281 plate as a replacement on 1972 to 1974 models, the plastic gasket for the 
Alternator must be replaced with newer style - order 022-903-203.

I do not know what the tin difference is between the 021 and 022 but the plastic ring is flat on one style and 
has a lip on the other. When I take engines apart most are mising the plastic ring. When I find both, I keep 
them together as matched sets.

Bartnik also says:

&quot;Pull the plate off the alternator and you will find the wiring inside.
There is a 3-prong plug for the wiring that goes to the voltage regulator,
that just pulls off. There is a wire that goes to a post for the B+
connection, undo the 10mm nut and set it aside, then pull that wire off.
Mine had the post under a little rubber cap.&quot;

 OK, I see that.  But I was so excited actually to remove the alternator I
forgot to study the wiring hookup properly before I took it off.  Question:
does the B+ post connector (with the cap) go flush against the alternator
itself, or do I sandwich it between two nuts?  Does it matter? My removed
alternator's B+ post has a 10 mm nut on it right now.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sandwich the ring between the 2 nuts.


More Bartnik:

&quot;You may want to inspect your cooling boot. Mine was in fine shape so I left well enough alone. I was tempted 
to replace it but I couldn't see how it
connected to the fan housing.&quot;

Sure enough, my cooling boot is slightly torn.  I don't have another one,
natch.  But if I get one I'll want to replace it - how do I get it off??

It is available here:

This is a brand new one via Ventura Warehouse Group.

Get it off of which part?
The fan housing?  Dig it out with a screwdriver.
Or the tin cover?  It has a clamp.
The pic at the link above shows what it looks like.
