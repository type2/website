Subject: goethe the two tone bullet

picked up goethe from the shop today.  they say they put the afm's
potentometer(sp) back to the stock.  she still idles rough but runs great on
the road and highway.  the new hankooks and sachs front shocks make the ride
nice, too.  i suppose i'll try leaning out the idle mixture.  she smelled
pretty rich, like making my eyes water rich, when i went back to open the
engine hatch to poke around.  the poking around is to make me look like i
actually have the slighest idea what i'm doing.
