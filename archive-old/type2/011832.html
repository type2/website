&gt;I want out.  I want someone who has more time and energy than I to take
&gt;this on.  It is a good bus and deserves a good home.  Most of all, having
&gt;bought it from Mark for $500 and expended another $200 getting it running 
&gt;(you would think that charging a battery would cost less... you would be
&gt;*wrong*! :-), and wanting *something* for my time and trips to Lancaster,
&gt;I want $1000 for this bus.

Oh this is funny of course as I made this call before Steve ever
actually bought the thing but I figured I'd chime in as usual.  First
if anyone didn't know and is wondering, Steve is a real stand up
guy.  And he already did some work to get this baby going.  Next
it isn't as bad as it sounds folks for around here at least.  I can't
imagine why he neglected to mention but he has pics up, take a
look.

Somebody give him a grand for this thing already.  It runs and it
is a Champagne '78 passenger.  I mean interiors like that fortunately
don't get made anymore 8-)  I mean brown dash, and LOOK at those
kick panels and interior panels, let alone the brown cord seats.
