Subject: CIS components?

ok, since significant portions of my fuel injection
system were fried in my engine fire, i'm trying to
price out replacing the system vs converting to cis.

anyway, the current kit from Gary Miller doesn't
include a lot of things one might find in a junkyard. 
that's fine, but i'm trying to get an idea how much
all those things might cost.
i've been researching the parts for volvos and rabbits
and can't figure out what Gary means by air/fuel
meter.  is this the airflow meter or the actual fuel
distributor?

can anyone who has done this conversion give me a
ballpark estimate as to what it costs?  also, if
anyone has parts numbers for the components i'd
appreciate that because i really don't know what i'm
looking for.

i'm afraid i might have to go with a carburator just
for economic reasons.

cheers,
will
