Phil, i think you are touching on the exact reason the Goodwill company had a
fleet of type2s for pickup and delivery in the 70's.

I have no idea why, but the vw bus tends to attract the 'charitable and
cautious' to quote J.Buffet.  

Perhaps the practicality (possibly also the nice, non-aggressive rounded
corners and droopy half-smiling, half sad physiognomy of a split) of it was
why, somewhere back in the 1950s, the first 'proto-hippie' (probably smiled
too much to be a 'beatnik') decided &quot;Hey, i can live in this thing, its cheap
and i won't need a pad!&quot;  ...and the rest is history.

It reminds me of a theory a freaky sorta art-major-hippy-dude friend of mine
had that the Good Ol'Greatful Dead were the ultimate example of non-agression
and were the 'anti-fu&amp;k-you' band because Jerry was missing part of the middle
finger of his right hand.

I did have a big rant here about the insincerity of biker charity, but i'd get
booted, so i'll keep it to myself.

&gt; Folks,
&gt; 
&gt;  I think OCTO, Orange County Transporter Organization, could
&gt; probably get the word out and get 50 to 75 busses to do a drive.  I don't
&gt; know about SOTO.  Even if we could only get 50 or 75 busses total...what an
&gt; impact that might have going down the road...and then handing over a bunch
&gt; of toys - think how good you'd feel!!
