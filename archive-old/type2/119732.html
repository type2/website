Subject: plate?

Happy Friday.. I need help here..
there is a square plate that goes around the exterior 110 electrical inlet.  It has 3 screws that screw it and a foam gasket to the body.  
My body shop lost mine and I can't find another at all.
Anyone have one or know where I can get one?

If anyone's headed to the junkyard this weekend, keep me in mind  :)
