Mine does this too. The problem is usually that the wire that runs from the
indicator light to the engine is old, and has too much resistance. This
causes the voltage that the indicator &quot;sees&quot; to be lower than the voltage
at the connection in the engine. When you run on your lights, or your turn
signal it causes a slight drop in voltage that is large enough to make the
indicator &quot;see&quot; a voltage that is too low. Replacing the wire from the
front to the back should fix the problem. It just doesn't bother me enough
at this point to be worth fixing. Some time I will get around to it though.
If it bothers you try replacing the wire. If you do, let me know how it goes.
