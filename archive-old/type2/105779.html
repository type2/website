 &gt; So im trying to get my new bug tuned up nice and i went outside today

 &gt; the timing light on and i didnt get any advance. It stayed at 10
 &gt; degrees, Then i kept going and the light just stopped.

Mechanical advance has spent its life without the specified
lubrication..  Remove cap. Remove rotor. add about half a dozen drops of
oil to the felt under the rotor. Replace rotor. Grab rotor and twist
back and forth until it frees up.  Put it all back together and check
for advance.
