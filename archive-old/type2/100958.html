Subject: Re: [T2] Rebuild questions - '78 2.0L

&gt; ALMOST finished with my '78 2.0L rebuild, have a couple of quick questions.  
&gt; Appreciate any help....

&gt; 2- I've been reading up, getting ready to reinstall the flywheel.  Some of 
&gt; the books mention a felt washer near the flywheel.  I don't believe I have 
&gt; one in my gasket kit.  Do I need one for a '78?

don't know about the gasket but don't forget to set the end play...just a
quick reminder, from someone who once forgot.

&gt; 
&gt; Those are the major questions for now.  Still trying to decide how to preset 
&gt; my valves for hydraulic lifters, still struggling on getting out that *)$!&amp; 

for hyd,  go to TDC for that cyl, then loosen valves, turn in screws until
they just touch the valve, then turn 1-2 complete turns on the screw (I go
1.5 myself) then lock it down  all valves are set the same.
