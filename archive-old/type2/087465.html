Subject: Re: [T2] shipping/title service inquiry

James,
I shipped my 78 Camper from Washington State to Indiana and I used Alaska 
Transport.  I am not sure of where all they pick-up and deliever but they 
come with my recomendation.  They were courteous, fast and safe.  My bus 
arrived without any travel wounds.  Good luck!
