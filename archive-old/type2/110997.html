&gt; I have a pertronix kit to install in my 78 Westy.  The distributer is

no. It goes away. Plus the little plug attached to it that the points
hook to will need to be removed. But do keep it &amp; a condensor in the
bus just in case. I haven't had a problem w/ the 3 units I have, but I
always keep some points (&amp; condensor) handy just in case. 

I believe it just helps keep the points from arcing much while opening
&amp; closing.

&gt; Red directly to the postive of the coil and black to the negative? Any 
&gt; install tips?

I believe that is correct, but make sure you double check it. The
sensor that slides on the shaft under the rotor is a pain to get on.
Just keep trying by turning it 90 degrees &amp; see is a soft push will
make it seat. after you try all 4 angles then push harder if that
doesn't work. 

the only other install tip is have is drink many beers to help console
the fact you don't have to set points anymore :)
