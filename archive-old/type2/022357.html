Subject: Need 215mm flywheel (74-75 bus)
Mime-Version: 1.0

Volks,

I am in need of a flywheel from a late 74 or 75 bus - the 215mm variety.  I need it because I want to have the reciprocating parts in my next engine balanced, and the shop needs to have the flywheel in order to do it.  The only 215mm flywheel I have is currently installed in my bus, and I don't feel like removing it right now.  :-)  I could also use the pressure plate if you happen to have it.  Please let me know if anyone has these parts for sale.

Thanks,

-David
