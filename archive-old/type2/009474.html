hey volks,

i'm just wondering i am probabley the most inexperienced in mechanics and 
cars on the list and here to learn as much as i can(just to let you know 
before you tell yourself how stupid this question is).
Is it possible to lower your bus about 2&quot; in the front by simply putting 
smaller shocks on? i own a 72 westy.
thanks
kenny
