Subject: fuel shutoff valve

Someone mentioned a fuel shutoff valve a loooong time ago and I was
wondering if that person (or someone else) has a source for one.  I'd
like to put one before my fuel pump so that if I need to change the
filter (or pump in my case), I can shut off the fuel easily.

If you could please email me directly that'd be great because I receive
the digest and might miss the reply..

Thanks,
Mike
