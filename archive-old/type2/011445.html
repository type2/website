Subject: DECK LID- Open or Closed?

Volks- I had a VW mechanic tell me today that while driving my bus, I
should leave the deck lid open. Not proped open, but not latched closed.
He said it would get me more cool air.  
Ever wonder how your oil leaks end up covering your back window?  Well,
air flows under your bus, and once it hits the end of the bus, it shoots
upwards, carrying your oil drips with it. It seems to me that this would
also carry the hot air from the exhaust up, too. And if your deck lid is
open, HOT air is being pulled into the engine bay.  Am I correct in
thinking this?
