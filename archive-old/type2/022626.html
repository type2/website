Subject: Excuse Me.. I Have Gas........!!!!!!!!!
Message-ID: &lt;460a97fd.24933f66_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

That is I have a gas leak, it seems . I first noticed what looked like a 
water spot but obviously a gas stain on my intake manifold.  When I inspected 
my carb.there was gas seepage on it . The seepage was mostly around the 
middle of the carb. None along the top and none that I could notice around 
the bottom. My carb is a Solex H30-31Pict made in Brazil. So I mostly humbly 
ask all you VW Wizards out there ?...... Should I rebuld this carb......, 
Will a universal rebuild kit for a pict 28 thru 31 work, thats all that seems 
available.... Should I think of getting a different carb, I heard these are 
crap...... Or  am I jumping to conclusions on this....., If it's a stuck 
float would I still need the rebuild kit
 
Reading all the horror stories in the archives on fires I am afraid to drive 
it till I work this out.    Any advice would be appreciated
