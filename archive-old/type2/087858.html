Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Clocks

[...]

This is true for the early mechanical clocks with an electric winder. However,
the later black faced clocks are quartz.


&gt; Don't throw that non-functioning clock away. A lot of times the problem is a
&gt; piece of low temperature solder that is used as a fuse. Once it melts or
&gt; breaks the clock stops. The following website goes over the repair
&gt; http://www.nateswaterart_dot_com/vw/vdo_repair/
&gt;
&gt; The website shows the clock totally taken apart with just the clock
&gt; mechanics shown. One does not have to take the clock completely apart. Most
&gt; fixes only require the removal of the back plastic cover.
&gt;
&gt; One other item that's not mentioned on the website that I found I had to
&gt; correct was lubricating the adjustment knob stem seals front of the clock.
&gt; If you look behind the front adjustment knob at where the stem passes
&gt; through the glass, you'll see that there are a set of seals that keep dust
&gt; out. My seals were so dry that they actually kept the clock mechanism from
&gt; being able to move the hands of the clock. A couple of drops of silicon
&gt; lubricant fixed this.
&gt;
&gt; These clocks are very robust mechanical devices. Many times nothing besides
&gt; the solder fuse is wrong. I bridged the broken solder fuse with wire and
&gt; plan to install an in-line microampere fuse when I put it back in my bus.
&gt; Right now it sits in my kitchen while I tweak it so it keeps accurate time.
