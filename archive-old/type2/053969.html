My good friend an old Mexican farmer told me about a way that he removed
flywheel bushings which has saved my butt many times in the boonies. You
take a heavy grease (wheel bearing is what I use) and fill the bushing with
it, then find a drift, or piece of solid metal which is very close to the
inside diameter of your bushing and place it against the grease. Then take a
hammer and hit the drift as hard as you can, it will push the dense grease
in behind the bushing and drive it out. I thought at first he was pulling my
leg, but it works great! Hope this helps.
