&lt;&lt; Comparing the Roadcow towing a bus to a stock bus towing a bus (or Geo)
 is like comparing The Rock........ &gt;&gt;

All I remember noting when I saw it at a &quot;wet westies&quot; campout was the water 
cooled Toyota engine conversion.  What frame, suspension and braking mods 
does he have per this analogy?

It was my understanding that Brit accomplishes what he does with common 
sense, care and finnesse' and some extra torque and hp; not a bus that's 
built up like a steroid soaked wrestle-mania freak!
