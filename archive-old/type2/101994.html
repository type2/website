This looks to be a factory partition. I have one of
these &quot;non-walk through&quot;  buses. You are right. It is
not as open as the buses with bucket seats but there
is a couple of things that I like about it. Having a
bench seat in the front allows you to hold your sweet
heart close to you while you are driving.  I would be
able do this in mine because mine is an automatic as
well. :) This is a good thing in the winter time to
conserve and share body heat and it can be good for
other reasons. ;)  &gt;&gt;

Let's see...Bench seat - Check! Automatic - Check!
What? No 'Necker Knob' ...?-)
