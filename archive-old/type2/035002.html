Subject: adjustable timing light??

&lt;&lt;&lt;Some timing lights have an adjustment on them for advance - you
just dial in
27 degrees and get the timing mark at 0 TDC at about 3000 RPM.  But
other
lights don't have this nice little feature (and they're less expensive
too!).  If you have one without the adjustment, the timing scale found
on
most type IV motors is wonderful because you just get the timing mark
at 27
degrees on the scale (to the left of 0).

The fan on my 73 has a notch that lines up exactly with the 0 mark on
the
timing scale.  But I also painted a bright red line on the fan where
it
lines up with the center of the case (since I have one of the nifty
adjustable timing lights).&gt;&gt;&gt;

what kind of price range are these timing lights?  that sounds like a
great idea to have one, especially with, as you stated, all the
different pulleys on all the different vehicles.  you could find tdc
then set the timing dead on with dialing it in on the timing light!!

you sold me man!!!...you sold me...i now believe i cant live without
one!!  but back to reality, and so that i don't get screwed, what are
some price ranges/brands you all recommend.

thanks
