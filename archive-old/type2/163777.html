My  premise is that what you are actually reading the heat being dumped
by the  spark plug into the head rather than the actual head temperature.

Y'all  think about it for a moment and tell me how I amthinking about this  
wrongly....besides the fact that &quot;that's where everyone puts  them&quot;.




hello Dave  I was hoping for some feedback on this. As I told you if  the 
guys racing Formula VEES do it that way then it must work pretty good seeing  as 
a good Vee motor will set you back 5 grand just for a long block. keep us  
informed on how your readings are doing. I personally think in the fins would be  
better than under the plug.  later  mark  Dearing
