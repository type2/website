&gt; I was wondering what kinds of paints work well for painting the engine

&gt; paint that is not only attractive, but safe and practical in protecting
&gt; the parts. Thanks.

any good quality Enamel paint should work fine, the tin should not get hot
enough to cause problems with the tin, in fact if the paint starts baking
check for other heat problems

I have used Rustoleum without any problems in the past
