Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Tires

Don't know what the situation is north of the equator but here in  
Australia it appears
that the tyre choice is wide.

We live in Hobart, Tasmania (pop. 170,000 with the entire population  
of the island under 500,000)
&amp; all it took was a call to the local Hankook dealer with the  
question: &quot;How much for 195R/14 RA-08s?&quot;

Got an immediate answer on price &amp; availability (incidentally they  
were A$108.00 each fitted &amp; had to
wait one day)

Maybe we're not so deprived in the Southern hemisphere
