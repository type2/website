Subject: Re: GoWesty 15&quot; tire and wheel package

Hi,

&gt; It's time for new tires on my '71 Westy and I came across this: 
&gt; http://www.gowesty_dot_com/MM101.ASP?pageno=130
&gt; That 15x7 alloy wheel/Michelin Pilot package looks good. Wonder why it won't 
&gt; fit a '71.

 Hmm, the tyres they suggest are the wrong size and are marginal in terms
of load rating. Their information is a little misleading, IMHO, since the
description of the bus tyre requirements as &quot;extraordinary&quot; is inaccurate
and the recommendation for &quot;reinforced&quot; tyres simply wrong (reinforced
tyres are the minimum spec. appropriate for lightly loaded busses, not
campers or panel vans). Type-2s should run on 185R14C tyres- a commercial
vehicle rating, not a reinforced car tyre.
 Their claim for improved handling is questionable- I suspect it reflects
an improvement on inappropriate tyres on 14&quot; wheels- ie our crap is better
than the crap you have now!!!

 185R14C tyres are made by all the major manufacturers- there are any
number of alternatives available in Europe, Asia, Oceania and Latin 
America. Don't let people bullshit you.

 Tirerack_dot_com list half a dozen 185R14Cs- the Michelin Agilis, Bridgestone
603V, Dunlop SP LT5 (I've used these- they're fine), Yoko Y356 and a 
Goodyear Wrangler. In various ratings/tread patterns with prices from $63
to $100.

 Get the right rubber- your bus will love you for it....

Cheers,
        W.
(Agilis 81s, since you ask).
