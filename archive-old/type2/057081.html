Subject: Used Fuel Pump Needed - 78 Bus
Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-transfer-encoding: 7BIT

I usually don't like using used parts, but I'm putting together a spare
parts kit for my son's bus prior to heading out to college.

One of the things I want to put in that kit is a spare fuel pump. However,
I'm not in to spending $150 - $200 for a new one. Any one have a good used
fuel pump they want to part with?

E-mail me.

Thanks.

Ric
