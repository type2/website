Subject: Re: [T2] voltage regulator toasted

Thanks for everyone's advise and input, including the pmail. I was
hoping someone knew what BusDepot was selling, and/or if I could find
the part without going mail-order. I'd like to get the replacement
completed this weekend, but I don't want to install a &quot;bailing wire and
chewing gum&quot; solution just to complete the effort by Monday morning. It
sounds like there is a part available via a non-mailorder route that
could last 10 years, maybe more. That doesn't strike me as a high risk,
&quot;cursed PO&quot; type install. Alternatively, there are 2 unknown solutions
available from BusDepot. Has anyone on this list had any experience
with either of the BusDepot voltage regulators? Are they worth waiting
for? Saving $8 isn't really a savings if I'm mortgaging 10 years of
reliable service, IMHO, but without reliable info on the BusDepot VR's
it isn't clear if that's what I'd be doing by buying the Wells VR650
solidstate VR.
