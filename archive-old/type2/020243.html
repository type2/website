&gt; That sounds like the a #3-4 exhaust manifold for a '79 california spec type
&gt; IV.  Are you sure that your engine is not a '79?  Do you have square
&gt; exhaust ports?

They look the same but the 75-78 have oval ports.
 
&gt; You might be able to have your cracked mainfold welded.  That is what I had
&gt; done to mine.  If it is a '79, it is stainless steel, so whoever welds it
&gt; must be able to weld stainless.  

I did not know that.
