Subject: SoCal events

Seein' as how it's Friday, I thought I'd remind everybody about the
informal Southern California events that I know of:

TWO WEEKS FROM TOMORROW!!!!! FEBRUARY 19: H. Steve Dolan, Visiting
Dignitary BBQ. Cabrillo Beach in San Pedro at 1:00. There is a nominal
parking fee ($5?), but plenty of parking, a picnic area, a really neat
little marine museum that kids just love, a playground, and of course,
the beach. Die-hard partiers can come over to my place when it gets dark
or we get kicked off the beach (whichever comes first), and there's room
for 6-8 campers in the alley behind my house. Take the 110 South, left
at Gaffey, left at 22nd St., right on Pacific Ave., left on Stephen White.

FEBRUARY 27: Meet at Knowlwood in Anaheim Hills (flier w/info at
http://home.earthlink_dot_net/~shrike3/000227flier.jpg). Official time is
2:00 - 4:00, but actually it'll go to &quot;whenever.&quot;

MAY 6 (tentative): Campout at Leo Carrillo State Beach (Pt. Mugu). More
details as I have them.

JUNE: Sam W. suggested a Morro Bay camp-out. I like it....
