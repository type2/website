&gt; OK....

&gt; Once again I am going to just throw mud against the wall and see if
&gt; something sticks.
&gt; Thinking about this on my 1.5 hour drive in bumper to bumper traffic here is
&gt; So-Cal to go 30 miles last night, these were my thoughts.

whee, mudpies....
&gt;
&gt; Compression good.

yep
&gt;
&gt; Lets just say for shits and giggles that you have fixed some of the other
&gt; problems.
&gt; A) Rough idle...in most cases this is a vacuum leak so lets look at it from
&gt; that point of view for a change.
&gt; 	1) Does yours have a EGR valve like my bug......if so is it
&gt; leaking?....this bypasses the box and will let air 	   in....then the
&gt; brain doesn't have a chance.

no EGR system at all

&gt; 	2) Plug all vacuum lines and plug the aux air not just disconnect
&gt; it.

plugged, nada

&gt; 	3) Bad aux valve would let uncontrolled air in.
&gt; B) Rough idle...Points.....check to make sure the mounting plate and the
&gt; points themselves are not broken.

check

&gt; In other words that it is not changing time/ gap on you if things a moving
&gt; around in there.
&gt; I have had a vehicle in my past that the dizzy was broken inside and the
&gt; points were moving.
&gt; I would set the gap and it would run for awhile then get out of dwell and
&gt; time again.
&gt; It drove me crazy then I found that things were moving on me after setting.
&gt; It was not easy to locate.

yeah I once had one too, but not this time

&gt;
&gt; Back to if it is still the old problem
&gt;
&gt; newly rebuilt injectors about 5,000 ago.......
&gt; ****still could be bad again they are rebuilt and most things rebuilt
&gt; anymore don't last long.

true but they will flood the engine

&gt;
&gt; (What the rest of the world calls a &quot;MASS airflow sensor&quot;...air box )
&gt; (I have checked the terminals per VW FI troubleshooting manual and two of
&gt; the ones I have check out fine, have tried them both with no effect)
&gt;
&gt; ***Electrically it checked out, but what about the physical sensing of the
&gt; air flow itself and sending it's signal to the brain?

yes.

&gt;
&gt; ***I must assume that you have cleaned all connections at the sensor and the
&gt; brain by now.

yes

&gt;
&gt; ***What about clean voltage to the brain....have you checked it? A good 12v
&gt; and a good ground.

good and solid.

&gt; ***If voltage is low then brains get a little messed up.....bad wire maybe?
&gt;
&gt; I am starting to think sensor signals are not making it back to the brain.
&gt; Chances of multiple brains having the same problem are not high....unless
&gt; they have a weak point in the circuit of the brain.

no in all the years I had VW FI I've never had a brain go bad,,  but I
swapped in one anyway

&gt; If all components are good then Wiring....it has got to be. Do you have a
&gt; wiring drawing and a volt-OHM meter that you can start checking the
&gt; resistance of the wires between the brain and the sensors? Those wires are
&gt; not that long that there should be very very little or no resistance... 0
&gt; Ohms.

still checking but so far all the ones I've done mostly sensor and brain
circuits are fine.

&gt;
&gt; After I checked the wiring and if every thing is good .....I say it is MAP
&gt; or injectors.
&gt; Since the MAP controls the injectors....I would start there......JC Whitney

???MAP???

&gt; sells both by the way.
&gt; Don't know about the quality....YET
&gt;
&gt; How did the fuel pressure come out....no change all the way thru till stall?

went out this afternoon and it was still showing 10lbs from last night.

&gt; The guy I talk to at Wolfsburg West calls them &quot;fuel infection&quot;....now I
&gt; know why.

when they work they are solid, but when they don't!!!

now one thing I am getting numb about, can't find the static timing
prochedures for setting the timing, always used the light while running
but hard to do when you can't get it running.

thanks
Bob
