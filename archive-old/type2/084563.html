&gt;David,
&gt;
&gt;Have you tried the 107i?

Nope.  But I once compared it's specs to that of the stock 914 cam, and 
they were very close.  I have experienced the stock 914 cam in Mike 
Gensler's bus and it was very impressive.  Gobs of reliable power everywhere.

&gt;I would be interested in hearing from anyone about the difference between
&gt;the 107i and the 91.

Well from the specs, lift is the same and duration is increased 9 degrees 
at .050.  That means more overlap, less vacuum.  You will lose low-end 
torque due to the overlap.  You will have to spin it faster to get into the 
powerband.  Your mpg will likely go down too.  On the bright side, you will 
lose the stoplight wars by a slightly smaller margin.  :-)

&gt;I am interested in the 91, but am going to use non stock fi(megasquirt).

If it is tuneable I don't see why it would be a problem.  Their comments 
are probably in reference to the stock FI.  Since I will likely convert to 
stock FI (or Miller if he is still in business) one of these days, I'm 
staying with the 107i.
