Subject: RE: 80 westy reving 2 high

&gt;Hi volks,a freind of mine has a 80 vanagon with a injected 2.0.after 
&gt;running on the highway for about 20 min,the rpms stay really high.
&gt;any one know what would cause this? thanks in advance

I'm not an L-jet FI guy, but on D-jet I'd suspect that the auxilary air valve 
was not closing.  I think these work the same on both systems.  After about 5-
10 minutes of driving it should have closed all the way so no air passes 
through it.  You can test it by warming up the engine (until it starts idling 
high), pull the large hose that runs from it to the air filter and hold your 
thumb over it.  If it sucks your thumb and drops the idle then it is not 
working.

I've had success refurbishing a couple of these NLA items from d-jet systems so 
if they're the same I can let you know how you may be able to rebuild it for 
free.
