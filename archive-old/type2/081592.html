Subject: Re: [T2] engine mounts

Yes you need a rear hanger bar [moustache bar].
Yes it is necessary.
A bug case will not have the 3 mounting holes. A type3 or a universal case
will [hence the name 'universal'.....]
The after-market hanger bars that use your oil pump bolts suck.


&gt;
&gt; Hello all-
&gt;
&gt; Just curious for some input on whether or not I need to fabricate some
engine mounts for my 72 westy into which I have recently installed a type 1
motor.  I know that in the bugs I have owned in the past, there were no
mounts.  It is one of those things that I know couldn't hurt, but is it
necessary?
