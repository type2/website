Subject: CDI modules (in UK?).

Hi volks,
               I've been wondering about installing a more modern ignition system in my camper and have got as far as 'phoning around the likely parts/accessories places in the UK. Unfortunately none of them seem to carry a reasonably priced CDI module, though they do have the Pertronix points replacement system.
 Does anyone know of a UK source for the module Bob Hoover recommends (from Universal Corp. if I recall, a company for whom  I have been unable to locate a website) or a near equivalent?
 Alternatively, how about a US source? Ron, do you carry these?

Cheers,
                 W.
