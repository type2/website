Subject: several questions...fast approaching goal for aug. 2nd

Hello again!

1) Well, my better half twisted off the bolt in his efforts to replace one 
of the exhaust manifold gaskets.  I have 1975 w/ a 78 engine....is this 
bolt #N 14684.1 (exhaust stud?)  If so, do I need to order anything else 
with this (other than a miracle?)

2) I can't find the part number for the bolts/nuts that hold the heat 
exchangers to the half round shaped pipe....there are 18 total....on the 
heat exchangers and to the muffler.

3) I bought: an oil pressure gauge, oil temp gauge and a voltmeter.  Where 
would you hook up the power?  I don't have any free terminals on my hazard 
switch.  I was planning on buying in line fuses for the &quot;power&quot; line of the 
gauges.  Also, since the sump plate is toward the rear of the vehicle, 
where should I run the wire for the oil temp gauge?  I know where it goes 
once I get to the firewall, but my only guess was to run the wire on or 
under the rock shield that covers that side of the engine.

4) I need to get my stove unit working.  Has anyone rigged their stove up 
to run off of the small Coleman bottles?  If so, do you have the 
size/number of the fittings/conversions that I would need?

Update:  Well, the steering coupler was a pain for the first part, since my 
arms are barely long enough to be inside the vehicle and on the underside 
at the same time.  Luckily, my better half gave me a hand.  We now have 
nice pedestal stand seat mats under our &quot;new&quot; Mitsub. Montero seats....ahh, 
comfort!  All inspection issues are accounted for EXCEPT...the exhaust 
leaks (see above.)  So, now i am shooting for next week for a re-inspection.
