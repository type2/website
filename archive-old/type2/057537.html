Greetings again -- 
First, thanks to all of you who answered my previous post on this -- that
was exactly the information I needed.

Second, I have a follow up to the first.  Now that I know that my wall
sockets are for shore power only, I still want to tap into my bus' 12V for
fans, reading lights, and what-not.  I've found that I have neither a
cigarette lighter nor a &quot;silver socket&quot; for easily hooking into this.  Can
anybody tell me how I can go about hooking up a 12V gizmo in the bus
without the convenience of one of these entry points?  Once again, thank
you for your help.
