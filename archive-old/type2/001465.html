This question may seem kinda dumb to some of you who may know the answer,
but I haven't been able to figure it out. I have a pair of screens for the
side window in brand new condition. The PO never installed them, but did
pass them on. They look to be factory though I don't know that for sure.
Question is: How do you install test things? There are no bolts or clips. Do
they mount on the inside or outside?

Thanks in advance for your help!!!
