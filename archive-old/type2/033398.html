Hi Volks,

I've rejoined the list to ask for advice about my 1973 westy.

The old girl has served me well, I've driven her 30,000 miles in the three
years I've had her. Almost daily, for about 18 months she was the only car
the family had. When I first got the van, I bondo'd and brush-painted it so
it didn't look too bad, but it was clear even then that there was more rust
than metal. Three years later the van is still drive-able, but I'm getting
apprehensive about taking the family too far from home in it. Maybe it's
time to pass her along, she's got lots of good stuff for transplant. Does
someone have a solid rolling-chassis they need a motor/interior for? The
westy interior is also in good shape, and I still have the icebox/sink,
although it's not in the van at the moment.

The Good Stuff:
 - I put 5 new tires on it this year, there are maybe 2,500 miles on 3 of
them, 1500 on the other pair.
 - Twin-carb motor runs well, just puffs a bit of blue smoke during
upshifts. 40,000 miles since rebuild.
 - The aftermarket muffler is about 16 months old, rusty but not perforated.
 - The Erspacher gasoline furnace works well.
 - The front seats are better than stock.
 - Camper interior cabinetry is in good shape although the fabric needs
cleaning.
 - Brake Master cylinder was replaced in June.
 - Clutch cable was replaced in August.
 - Trailer hitch
 - Middle seat from Type 2 passenger van also available, in good condition.

The Bad Stuff:
 - Rust all over and under, in the usual places. I used to think the draft
at my shoulder was a bad door seal.... in fact it turned out to be a hole in
the wheel well behind the drivers seat. The rust elsewhere is gaining on me,
and winter (salt-season) approaches once more.
 - The big screen in the pop-top is shredded, but the side windows are OK.
 - The heater boxes are long gone. (Surprise, surprise.)
 - The windshield is in bad shape, but every other window is intact.

The bus is in Toronto, Canada. I can't part it out, it has to go whole.
I'm willing to drive to the border if the buyer will cover my bus fare home,
but only for a confirmed sale. I can email digital pics of specific parts of
the bus if you're interested in making an offer. I'd also be interested in
trade for an interesting motorcycle, esp. a dual-sport/enduro model.

Thanks for your time,
