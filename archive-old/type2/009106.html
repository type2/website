&gt;I have a 71 Hardtop Westy and there is a little metal plate riveted 
to the
&gt;cabinet along the sliding door  wall.....it is by the floor riveted 
to the
&gt;wood....it says Westfalia on it and a bunch of other stuff that I 
can't read
&gt;because its worn off...
&gt;that could be it??
&gt;mine was made in Germany

They were all made in Germany Isaiah :-)
The plate you are speaking of is not the VIN plate.  It is the 
Westfalia number plate, which basically states what model of interior 
you have.  It was added when the interior was installed by Westfalia.
The VIN plates on Buses are installed at the Volkswagen factory.
