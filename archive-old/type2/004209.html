I remember hearing the same results.....I have used the Wal-Mart 20-50 for a
while and periodically have my engine oil analyzed.......same results as the
Castrol......40 cents cheaper a bottle.

For me, anyway, it works, for I change my oil every 2000 or less miles
anyway..........

&gt; &lt;&lt; Comments on this? At 3000km oilchanges, would this oil suffice? &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Consumer Reports did an extensive review and evaluation of motor oil and
&gt; other additives about 2 or 3 years ago.  Its release actually &quot;made the
news&quot;
&gt; because it was such a major project.  Their conclusions?
&gt;
&gt; If I recall correctly, as long as the oil had the standard
&gt; seals/certifications/ratings etc. there was NO appreciable difference in
&gt; performance and engine wear from brand to brand.  They also determined
that
&gt; most additives are a waste of money.
