Subject: Re: [T2] weber carbs and brake booster

[...] Pedal effort is real high without the brake booster operating - to the
point of being unsafe, IMHO.  I can almost guarrantee you would hate it.
Somebody must know of a way to add a vacuum port to one of the manifolds.

&gt; Hi Everybody,
&gt; Right niw I am in the process of getting my 71 westy going(needed
&gt; engine) and i was planning on using the dual weber DCNF's that i have.
&gt; Is there any way to hook up the booster to this/these carbs? is it
&gt; necessary or can the car be driven without the extra help of the
&gt; booster? thanks for any reply
