&gt; I've decided the Turtle would be most useful for me and my family if I took
&gt; out the blind side closet and put in a full width Z-bed.  Anyone have one in
&gt; New England for a bay bus?  Or at least a full width rear seat that can take
&gt; the conversion from Z-products.  TIA
Mark,

I have heard the z-products conversion puts the seat level with the rear
deck and doesnt include a rear pad... thus half of you is on padded seat,
the other half on metal over engine.

doesnt sound too comfy.

peas,

Steve
