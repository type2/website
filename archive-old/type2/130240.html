Subject: Re: [T2] just purchased a 70 Bus and have some questions

Thanks to everyone for the suggestions and support.

My plan is going to go down like this...hopefully :). Monday, my wife 
and I are leaving Savannah, Ga sometime that night we are going to be 
in Lawrenceville, NJ just a few mile north of Trenton. On Tuesday 
morning, we are going to meet with the current owner of the Bus and 
grab it from him. Then if we can get it scheduled drive down to 
Burlington NJ to Volks Tech to get it looked over. After that we will 
slowly over the next two days make the trip back to Savannah.

I will be bringing along from all you suggestions:

Bentley Manual
Tools
Fire Extinguisher
Jack
Spare Tire (of course)
Oil 15W40 was recommended
List of AIRS group
uHaul Listing

I don't have access to the other parts that were recommended on such 
short notice, but I'm hoping if I take it in before I leave she will 
make it. Maybe get some of those additional parts from the Mechanic. 
And if she doesn't that's what the list of AIRS group and the uhaul 
listings are for. And like someone said before I am a novice at this, I 
had a bug about 15 years ago, but never really did anything to it. My 
goal is to learn how to do all this repairs myself one day, but for now 
I'm going to need some help.


Thanks again this group is amazing. Everyone responds so quickly and 
with great suggestions. I hope to one day be able to help out someone 
with my knowledge of my experience working on my new bus.

&gt; take a Bentley manual and some basic tools, and maybe a few minor spare
&gt; parts like a set of points.  make sure you cell phone is charged and 
&gt; your
&gt; triple A is paid up.  carry some food and water too., (for you not the
&gt; bus)
&gt;
&gt; have a safe trip
