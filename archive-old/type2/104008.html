Subject: Re: [T2] Braided wire on dissy plate

&gt;Martin, You have explained you problem very good, the
fix for the skip is to repair the broken wire, to do
this take the plate out of the dist, take it to
someone who has a tig welder and get them to tack it
back on. Then clean it up, lube it and put it back on,
good luck with it. Phil
