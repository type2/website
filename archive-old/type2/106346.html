Subject: Type 2 list : 1 The Smog Man: 0

I got Mitchell to change their smog data to reflect the fact that 76 1/2 models lost the thermostatic air cleaner. Half the battle won...

Does anyone have a smog contact in the govt who we can contact to take this information and distribute a bulletin (or create a reference) about it instead of having to wait for all of the existing manuals to be replaced?

Richard, 
Thank you for your input. We have corrected our database and have added a footnote identifying the VIN number production break for vehicles without ACL.

Subject: Error in Emission Control Applications Guide 


Hello, 

I found an serious error in one of your books: 

Emission Control Applications Guide 
1968 - 2000 Import Vehicles 

In the section covering Volkwagen models you have these entries: 

1976 Type 2 MFI -- PCV, ACL, 16 EVAP, 2 15 OC, 2 FR, EGR 
1977 Type 2 MFI -- PCV, ACL, 16 EVAP, 2 OC, 2 FR, EGR 
1978 All -- PCV, ACL, 16 EVAP, 2 10 OC, 2 10 FR, EGR, 12 AIS 
1979 Type 2 MFI -- PCV, 16 EVAP, OC, FR, 13 EGR, 2 O2S, 2 CEC 

The error is that ACL (Thermostatic Air Cleaner) was eliminated halfway through 1976 on Type 2 vehicles starting with VIN 2262077584.

This error is causing serious grief to owners of Type 2 VWs that have to pass the visual inspection aspect of mandatory California smog tests. The error is causing techs to believe an ACL should be present on later model VWs when it was eliminated by factory desigers part way through 1976.
