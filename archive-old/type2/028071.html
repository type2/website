I used to maintain records on my '67 splittie. 34pict3; dual vacuum dizzy. Averaged 24 MPG and I think it was always running a little rich due to the age of the carb and the lack of skill I possess in tuning. Otherwise, pretty tight engine. 1600; AE case.

I don't believe it would be impossible to attain 30 MPG, but a splittie *is* a lighter vehicle. All things considered, I'd be happy with anything over 20, but generally concerned about under 20. But that's me...and I ain't no mechanic or economist...and we probably won't see $4/gal gas until November at the soonest. Just think...at some point it becomes economical to own a camper simply so you don't *have* to commute. Just sleep in the bus. ;)

Have fun! Joe
