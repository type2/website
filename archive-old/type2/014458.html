Hi all,

I'm looking for a good dependable shop that would be capable of doing a
world class valve job in the Chicago area.

Anyone have any suggestions? 

My Bus has been at VW for 2 weeks and they have decided out of the blue
that it is a time consuming job, and they don't want to do it. ( after
it has been there for almost 2 weeks )

Never heard of anything so crazy.
I take a VW to VW and they can't work on it.

NUTS!!

Thanks,

            ______________
