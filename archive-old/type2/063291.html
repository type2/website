&gt; There was a split featured in Volksworld, July issue, which looked beautiful.
&gt; The lower half was 'rainbow blue' which is like that deep sky colour you get
&gt; when it's clear and dry.  The upper half was bright white (like clouds in
&gt; above sky with sun shining on them).  That was be a cool colour scheme IMHO.
&gt; I think bluish green (turqoise?) is a great colour for buses also, again with
&gt; a white top half.

I see a lot of busses are repainted turqoise these days. It does look 
great. Does anyone know if this was an optional color, or is it just a 
trend. I don't recall any split window, except in the 4
VW primary colors (black, white, green, and red).
