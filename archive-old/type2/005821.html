Subject: Replace Volvo Seats in '77 with Vanagon or better

Hello from Colorado!

I have a '77 Westy Weekender in Denver, CO and I'm looking for options to
replace my old seats.
I have dug thru the archives, but have not found too much relating to my
situation.

The PO replaced the stock seats with VERY uncomfortable, early 80's volvo
seats. Unfortunately, he also removed and promptly **lost the stock seat
tracks**. I have been wanting to replace these seats with Vanagon seats,
preferably the ones with the arm rests.

1) Does anyone have stock tracks that would fit in a '77? (I think Best
option if I can find them)
2) Can V-gon seat install easily be accomplished without the stock seat
rails?
(I figure than my current drivers seat is already un-adjustable, what do I
really lose?)
3) If not, how hard is it to modify V-gon seat rails to fit in bus (if even
possible)?
4) The passenger side has the swivel seat, so would Vgon seats be to tall
for the side?
5) What other seats should I consider? ( I have heard Subaru seats may be
good, also Porsche 924)
6) Anyone (listee or friends of listee) in the Front Range have these V-gon
seats for sale or know of a place to get them?

I am looking for seats in fair to good condition. I would consider having
them re-upholstered in the near future. The capitains chairs with arm rests
would be a big plus!

I'm trying to get someting installed before setting out for Jerome on Sept
13th. My back can't take another minute with these seats!

Feel free to -pmail me if necessary

Thanks in Advance,
Chris Hammock
