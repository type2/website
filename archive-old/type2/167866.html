Subject: Re: [T2] OEM wheels?

Hey, Rick, where are you located? I have five stock wheels from my '79 that
I'm planning on removing. They have the correct tires, but they are worn.
They are all in great shape professionally painted white. I'm in Alameda (SF
Bay area). Let me know if you might be interested and I'll get moving on
their replacements.

Andy

&gt; Hi People,
&gt;
&gt; Pumpkin II came from the PO with what I am told are
&gt; Audi mag wheels.  Same bolt patter, but the the oem
&gt; studs are just a hair shorter than I'd prefer.  I also
&gt; need new tires, so I thought I would explore possibly
&gt; going back to OEM wheels and tires.
&gt;
&gt; The audi's are 15&quot; diameter and the current tires are
&gt; 215 75 R15.  This provides plenty of clearance for
&gt; dirt roads (and mechanical work), but doesn't provide
&gt; the best &quot;gear ratio&quot; for the hills I climb.
&gt;
&gt; I'm thinking of
&gt;
&gt; a) Putting on slightly smaller tires and keeping the
&gt; audi rims (and installing longer studs). This would
&gt; keep some clerance, but improve the gear ratio.
&gt;
&gt; b) Or just going with OEM rims and tires.
&gt;
&gt; I do occasional dirtroads (at campgrounds) but nothing
&gt; too drastic.
&gt;
