&gt;Hi All. I have the chance to buy a 2l fi engine and 6 rib trans to replace
&gt;the 1800 carbed engine and auto trans I currently have in my 74 bus. What I
&gt;need to know is how much drama it is going to be to make this combo fit with
&gt;the 6 rib trans? I remember seeing some where that a 3 or 5 rib trannies are
&gt;the only ones that will fit into this model. Why is this? is it something to
&gt;do with the trans to chassis mount? if so is it possible to fabricate an
&gt;adaptor? I am not worried about setting up a shifter or the FI etc at this
&gt;stage, just whether I can bolt this setup in.
&gt;I Have searched the archives and gone through the library drive train
&gt;section to no avail.

Hmmm... that's interesting because I (and others) have posted this info 
many times before.

In a nutshell, the 6-rib trans (091) and bellhousing are 1&quot; longer than the 
3 and 5 rib (002) transaxles.  1/2&quot; is in the bellhousing and 1/2&quot; is in 
the trans itself.  If you use the earlier bellhousing with the 091 trans, 
you can squeeze it into an earlier bus by utilizing (completely, I might 
add) the built-in flexibility of the engine and tranny mounts.  Just 
barely.  But you'll have to use your '74 flywheel, clutch and starter with 
the '74 bellhousing.  And the top of your gearshift will be a bit further 
back.  If you want to use all of the later parts, well... has anyone 
actually done that?  I don't see how it could work without serious 
modifications.
