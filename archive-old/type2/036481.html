&gt;I used the metal gaskets last time I pulled off the manifold and they seem
&gt;to work quite well.  Fairly similar to the metal gaskets on the exhaust
&gt;system.  I think they'll do you right.

My opinion on the metal gaskets is that they will not make a perfect seal
unless the sealing surface is very smooth.  I have gone through an extended
cycle of pulling the intakes, replacing the gaskets, tightening things
down, spraying carb cleaner around the base to check for leaks, and having
the engine almost die from carb cleaner leaking past the gaskets.

When I say &quot;not a perfect seal&quot; I mean that the leak is enough to let some
carb cleaner through, but since I triple-checked that the surfaces were
flat and clean I don't think the leak could have been large enough to
offset the mixture significantly because of the volume of air passing
through the manifold (when the engine is running of course).

Still, the leak annoyed me so I started polishing the mating surface on the
heads.  I have a picture of the last time I did this on the MSHP heads that
went on my engine 25,000 miles ago:

The picture will only be up for the next six days since I will be moving
back to Dallas after that time and the computer will be in a box in my bus.
:)

The polishing solved the problem with the carb cleaner, so I will do this
to all my heads from now on.  All that is involved is a few minutes per
port with 220 and then 400 grit sandpaper.  Go to higher grits if you get
off on bright shiny things.  Be careful not to go too crazy with the 220
grit or you could create low spots that won't seal.  All that's necessary
is to remove the surface imperfections.
