Subject: Hot Start Relay blowing fuses?? &amp; Trip report SW Va &amp; bus siting &quot;Pirates of Silicon Valley&quot;
Message-ID: &lt;3778584A.1AB3_at_ibm_dot_net&gt;

Hey all,
just returned for a wonderful weekend of camping:

1) I installed the Hot start relay kit into my 76 camper (FI 2L, 4sp) It
has been working great until this weekend.  We drove for 2-3 hours,
stopped &amp; then tried to start the bus.  Nothing - checked the relay and
the fuse had blown.  Replaced it, drove all weekend in SW Va mountains
(see below) and it started great.  Driving back home ~3hrs, stopped,
went to start it and a blown fuse again.  Both times the engine oil temp
was 220-230 for a while.  Today it was &gt;90 ambient past 8pm.  So, 'm
thinking that the relay helps, but when the starter gets too hot (23yo
starter) the solenoid/starter is too bound and requires SO much current
that it will instead blow the fuse - make sense?  Is this correct - do I
need a new starter?

2) Trip report - Julia &amp; I went to the Mount Rogers National Rec Area /
Grayson Highlands State park in SW Va. Basically, where NC &amp; Tenn meet
at their northern most point, go about 15 miles north into Virginia. 
Beautiful area, lots of rolling mountain sides - and open pasture /
grass lands.  Lots of horse riders love to go their (lots of horse
trails)  The Appalachian trail wanders through lots of it and there are
many other trails that small (or large) loop dayhikes can be put
together.  We stayed at the Grayson Highlands State Park campground 1
night - $14 +$3 for our dog - small, semi private spaces (we were in
luck - it was raining, so there wasn't too many folks in the &quot;tent&quot; area
(as opposed to full hook ups).  The campground is nice - lots of
vegetation and trees, but the spaces are close.  Sat &amp; Sun night we
stayd at Grindstone campround - National forest.  Lots of room, private
sites.  We had half of a loop to ourselves.  Lots of canopy as well. 
-$14/night - no pet fee.  Both campgrounds had hot showers.  The area is
mountainopus and we spent a lot of time in 2nd and 3rd gear, up and
down.  There are other forest service roads that open to large meadows. 
Matter of fact, we saw a ~70 camper in a meadow off of a &quot;no passenger
vehicle&quot; road a couple of years ago.
E-mail w/ any questions or info requests

3) lastly - this kind of a &quot;techie&quot; bus bunch and no one commented on
the Tv movie - &quot;Pirates of Silicon Valley&quot;?? there was the camper that
they drove in one scene - It was supposed to be 1971 I think?  The bus
sure did look like a late 70's - anyone notice?

Take care
