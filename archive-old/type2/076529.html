Subject: Tail lights...

Hey Volks!

Good News! I have found a source for Brazilian made light assemblies at a
pretty low cost, and was thinking about importing a bunch of them for
distribution here in the states. Many of these include the bulb holders
too, and I am sure the price will be better than anything else you could
find around here. (I am not positive on the price yet, as it partly
depends on quanitity, and I haven't decided how many I am going to get.)

I thought I would do a little bit of market research, and see what the
demand here on the list is. There are some really sweet looking ones for
those who like to customize, and stock are available as well for many
lenses. If enough people are interested we could certainly save on some
shipping from Brazil.

Also if any of the list vendors are interested in stocking any of these
in larger quantites, I would be happy to make a deal for larger
quantities.

There are photos of the various lenses available here:

Thanks,
