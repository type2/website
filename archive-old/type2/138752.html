Subject: Need Parts

Looking for the plug that fills the hole behind the flywheel. I guess the hole
is for removing the torque converter on automatics. Currently the hole is
there to allow air pressure to go places it shouldn't. Also looking for a tdc
sensor or something appropriate to fill that hole. None of the salvege yards
around here have any busses so it's difficult to find these little parts. If
you have either of these that you would like to part with or know where I
could find them I would appreciate the help. If you know the part number for
either of these, that info would be a great help also.
Thanks to you all,
Tom
