Subject: Re: [T2] how hot?

[...]
Running extremely hot race engines i have never holed a piston from 
heat alone.  Blown valves/heads/jugs yes.
the only times i have holed pistons is from detonation. (bad timing)

&gt; I am wondering if anyone knows from experience a head temp that burned

&gt; soon, might be caused by 2nd barrel of solex progressive too lean.  
&gt; What is
&gt; the max head temp you would run for a short trip?  (or what temp would 
&gt; you
&gt; stop and pull over)
