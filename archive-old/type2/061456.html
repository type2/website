Subject: Need emissions help!

Hey all!
I'm having a devil of a time getting my '71 bus to
pass Missouri emissions.  Here's the bullet:  The
engine is a brand new (200 miles) 1641, pretty plain
engine.  The cam is not stock, but nothing to
radical.  The owner of a VW parts house called it a
C40, I believe, and highly recommended it to help the
bus accelerate a little more smoothly away from a
stop.  The cam was in my old engine that passed
emissions.  The carbs are dual Kadrons; they have
been re-bushed and also passed emissions on my old
engine. Both carbs run 125 main jets and 55 idle
jets.  I synchronized them using a uni-syn, and did
have to adjust the throttle up a bit on side 1 and 2
cylinders.  My synchronizing technique could
certainly be flawed.  I did not touch the idle bleed
screws at all.  My timing on a 009 distributor with
compu-fire is at 38 degrees advance, the idle is at
900  rpm.  I checked the spark on my coil and spark
plug wires, and all were blue.A new rotor and
distributor cap were installed to rule them out.  The
bus runs pretty well; sometimes the idle is a little
inconsistent, as the longer it idles  the rpms drop
slowly.  
The hydrocarbons are my downfall; the standard in
Missouri is 700ppm and the bus measured 2000ppm.  I
went home, pulled out the spark plugs, and 1 and 2
plugs were very sooty black.  I put in four new
plugs, drove for one hour on the highway to get the
engine good and warm, drove back to the gas station
for another emissions test, and the reading was
2200ppm!!!  What  is my next move?  Should I forget
the kadrons and go back to a stock 34 pict , which I
already own, drive the bus more to set the rings and
valves, synchronize the carbs differently.....?
All comments are welcome and appreciated.
Brian A.
