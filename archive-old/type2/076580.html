Subject: Subject: Re:  Living out of a Bus

I just bought a 1981 Westfalia Air Cooled camper  that I'm resurrecting
from the dead zone.
At some time in the past someone had lived in it. There are several tell
tail signs that it was a regular sleeper rather than a weekend use Westy.
The number one thing was that this person shared the van with a dog. 
If you're going to spend your three months living in your Westy.... spray
all of your upholstery down with static cling remover / reducer spray.
The Westy had dog hair clinging to everything including the upper bunk.
I'm going to call it static cling that attracted the fine hair to
everything.
Point being; the dog hair is very troublesome to remove.
A simple vacuuming doesn't get the job done, it has to be brushed and
then 2&quot; masking tape has to be rolled over every surface to get the fine
hairs off.
I've noticed that static electricity is more troublesome in the winter
months so if you're going to have your canine buddy with you plan to wear
a fair amount of his winter coat.
