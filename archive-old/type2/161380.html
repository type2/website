Subject: Plan for adaptor engine Jetta|Golf

Hello Volk
Im looking for a plan to make an adaptor plate plan for Golf/Jetta
Engine to be done at a shop in my area

Since this plate has been produce for over 20 year, im sure its
possible
to find a plan or programm for CNC machined!! i know there is an
angle issue so the engine fit the bay area

i already sold my type 4, and looking to put in a diesel 1.9TD for
torque and heat!!

ve been told to make it in aeronautic aluminium ..more expensive but
will last forever ..

any help is appreciated
