Subject: Re: [T2] Distributor rebuilder???

&gt; You want to contact Philbin Manufacturing here in Portland, Oregon.  Visit
&gt; their website at www.philbingroup_dot_com/rebuilt/distributors.htm
&gt; When I last visited them they had rebuilt 205Ts in the box, on the shelf.  Or
&gt; they can rebuild yours.

i was going to write that yesterday but philbins website is dead. are they
still in biz?
