Subject: pop out windows

Quick question on the pop outs on my '66 splittie. The PO for some dumb
reason tried to pull off the hinges on the side pop outs and couldn't get
them off due to the welding from the factory but now they are all bent and a
window will not fit on them. I was curious if there are any after market
hinges made by any of the various suppliers. I have all six of the windows
for it but four of them have been messed with too badly, if anyone knows of
a manufacturer of these or has any tips on fixing the old ones let me know.

Sometimes you want to kill POs!
