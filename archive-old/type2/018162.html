&gt; I just checked the website for Kool Seal and found that they have a

It'd have to be on the thick side (1/8&quot; or greater) to have much effect
in deadening the vibration, I would think.  Also, the fiberglass isn't
going to be as dense as a rubber type product, and therefore less
effective in reducing vibration.

But here's another thought on the Q-pads, while we're on the subject.  I
noticed that after applying them and the Kool-Patch, the temperature
inside my bus must have climbed a few degrees.  This could be due to a
combination of things:
	-the curtains are out of the van,
	-global warming,
	-and the Q-Pads and Kool-Patch are BLACK!
I strongly suspect that the last one has a great effect on the
temperature of the bus.  Take this scenario:  your bus is basking in the
sunlight.  The metal, of course, is a good conductor of all sorts of
energy (sound, electrical, and heat), and so conducts the heat energy
directly to the adhered Q-pads.  These wonderful little tiles, being
black, suck that energy right up.  And they keep it, slowly raising the
inside temperature of the bus.   Now in a cold weather climate, this
would be nice, especially in light of the bus's notorious heating
system.  But what about in a hot weather climate?

Now assume that you've installed fiberglass insulation over the Q-Pads
in the walls and ceilings.  On the floor you've got carpet padding and
maybe that NASA insulation stuff.  This would presumably keep some of
the heat out of the bus.  But on a hot summer day, such as we have here
in Texas, the greenhouse effect would raise the interior temperature of
the bus.  The insulation would of course do its job and keep that heat
where it is:  inside.  Voila!  Toasty bus.

Would this be a correct analysis?

It brings me to a further consideration:  all of this comes from G.
Matthew Bulley's heat and noise site wherein he also describes
insulating the engine compartment.  I haven't done this and am hesitant
to do so since our buses are, in fact, air cooled.  What happens when
you trap that heat in the place where you don't want it, namely,
lingering around your precious engine?  I like the idea of keeping
engine heat out of the passenger space, but might this be harmful? 
Anyone have any actual experience (as with an oil temp or CHT gauge)
with the procedure?

Just another thought in light of the discussion on hot-weather driving.
