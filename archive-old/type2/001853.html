I'm confused. I just put a new 009 distributor in my bus. Now the points
won't stay set. I set the point gap before installing, then cranked it to
set the dwell. The bus started and ran for a couple minutes then quit. I
hooked the tach/dwell meter back up and 0 degrees of dwell. After saying a
few words I reset the dwell to 44 degrees and checked to make sure
everything was tight and in it's right spot. Started it up and after 5
minutes it started to run pretty bad, so I looked at the dwell again - now
its up to 75 degrees! Everything is tight and in it's right spot, nothing
between the points and the base plate. What am I doing wrong?
