Subject: Re: [T2] Oil leak at sending unit 71 type 1 engine

I have this, too.  Tape, etc isn't a good idea because the senders ground
through the threads.  I had a vdo gauge/idiot light in that would not work.
replaced it with the regular plug and light only.  It's dripping and doesn't
want to tighten up. Am hoping to glean ideas from the replys to your post,
Jody in Seattle
