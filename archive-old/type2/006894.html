Subject: Safely back from Jerome! with HOT oil.

Roger (Nang) &amp; I left for Jerome from san Jose (Norcal) _at_ 8pm on Thursday 
evening and got there just after the noon hour on Friday, a great trip with 
the minor hiccup of a fan belt replacement just prior to dawn before Needles. 
The timing was perfect and we went though the hot hot desert at night or at 
dawn. 

The meet was great &amp; as Ronnie says very mellow. I will post a web set of 
pictures when I get home from work this evening, no words just pics.

Rachel &amp; Jon threw a rod or something near Lake Havasu, so Rachel accompanied 
us back and we dropped her off in Monterey at around midnight on Sunday. I 
have a bunch of Jon's stuff still in the 70 westy that will wend its way back 
to Monterey.

The Westy certainly has some interesting symptoms if not problems. The 
cylinder head temp pretty much stays in the middle of its range at around 
250, but the oil temp got up to 300 degrees F in the desert heat, It must 
have been over 100 degrees ascending the long grade out of Needles to Barstow!
Roger &amp; I drove very slowly so we got over 25 mpg in a 70 poptop westy loaded 
with stuff, great but it took us 19 hours to get back to san Jose instead of 
16 going.

Thanks to ABS for such a great meet, but I will have to re-evaluate 35 hours 
driving for 36 hours bus meeting.
