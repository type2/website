Subject: Re: [T2] Hard Starting - Update 2

Marc,

If I remember correctly, I had the same problem untill I realized that the 
plugs are color coded to the connectors for those parts.

Look again and see if they aren't!

Pics here...not big detail, but maybe close enough.

http://www.shockwaverider_dot_com/newengine/picture-001.html

Blue to blue for coldstart
Brown to brown for thermo?

Now here is what really bothers me!  I was having trouble maintainig idle 
after startup on my new 78 2.0l.  Changed the head temp sensor to a new 
one that I had for several months and everything was really great.  Fired 
up on a 23 degree morning like a champ!

But!  Went to get a christmas tree Sunday morning in the rain(about 50 
degrees) and the bus did not want to start....I had to open the throttle a 
little before it fired up...which to me means too much fuel was there.

Did just fine for the return trip.

I haven't had time to investigate further yet...or check gas mileage 
lately...



Cheers, dave

I've been having hard starting problems in the morning, smelling gas, and getting really lousy gas mileage.
&gt;  
&gt; Here's my question - when I reconnected the engine, I didn't know which plug went where from the cold start valve, the thermo time switch, or the auxillary air valve.  I broke out the wiring diagrams and took my best guess, and figured I got it right because the engine started.  
&gt;  
&gt; Now I'm not so sure.  Could these symptoms be explained by having the plugs in the wrong place?

&gt;  
&gt; Thanks as always.
&gt;
