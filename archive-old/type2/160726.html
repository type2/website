Subject: Re: [T2] Antenna Question

There are 3 types of antenna mounts as far as I know as I've used all three.   One is where the base of the antenna is somewhat &quot;ball&quot; like and swivels in a concave fitting.  This type is for infinite angle adjustments and requires one hole for mounting.  A second type is the one as pictured in Don's picture.  It requires one large hole and one small hole.  Both holes are used to secure it to the body, the smaller one keeps it upright.  The third type mount is 2 large holes several inches apart with 2 bulky looking mounts.  I think these were used most often on older VW's.  Greg
