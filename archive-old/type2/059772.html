Greetings,

&gt;He mentioned that my distributor jumps around a lot and is not advancing
very far.  Anyone know what the causes for this might be? 

Here's a thought. This happened to Phrogbus about 16 years ago: The rotating
plate on which the points mount had a bind in its bearing. As a result, the
spring couldn't return it to the zero advance position. Not knowing this at
the time, I did a perfect timing adjustment. Or so I thought. Needless to
say, every time the vacuum went down, it went to some random position. And
of course the possiblity existed that it could &quot;max out&quot; its stroke. Anyway,
I flushed it out, and sprayed some typewriter lubricant (I was working my
way through school fixing IBM Selectrics at the time) and re-adjusted the
timing after verifing that it was in the zero position: suddenly I'm driving
a new car. Since then, every time before I adjust the timing, I suck, then
blow into the advance.

Hope this helps,

Phroggie and his Phrogbus (70 hack camper conversion)
