&gt; &gt; On a Safety-Kleen parts washer, there is a wire that holds the lid up. If
&gt; &gt; the solvent in the tank catches fire, the wire melts and lets the lid drop,
&gt; 
&gt; However, the aircraft flame sensors are quite a bit more sophisticated,
&gt; since they actually sense the flame, not the heat.  By the time your
&gt; fusible link melts, the fire is well established!

Oil furnaces have a optical flame sensor, not all that expensive for the
parts.
