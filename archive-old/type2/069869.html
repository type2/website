So HLPinc_at_aol_dot_com says:
&gt; Hey all--
&gt; 
&gt; So I am the proud owner of an Eberspacher BN4 (Special thanks to Wallie
&gt; Meisner), and now I'm looking at all this stuff, and I'm wondering, what do I
&gt; do now?  At least I can put my warm, but extremely unsafe  propane

You should start by getting on your web browser and go to the vanagon
mailing list archive and use the search option on 'BN4'.  Read up on
all the material that's already been posted on this subject and get back 
to this list if you have any more questions.

Here is where the archive web site is:

Good Luck!
