Subject: Re: [T2] Leaky Valve Covers

What works for me it:

Wire brush v/c lip to remove ALL traces of old gasket.
Apply 3M Super Weatherstrip Adhesive to V/C and one side of gasket.
Set aside.
Under bus with a piece of Scotchbrite®.
Polish sealing surface of head until bright and shiney.
Mate V/C and gaskets.
Apply a thin coat of wheel bearing grease to gasket.
Carefully align V/C and head.
Pry bail (which should have the offset in the center pointing down, BTW)
over V/C.
Wiggle cover a bit to make sure that it's properly placed. (Use flashlight!)

Jim
