When I bought my 78 Westy the previous owner gave me an analog German clock
which I assume was installed in earlier VW's. The type2 library had a good
article on this optional jewel and after reading it and cleaning the contacts I
temporarily installed it under my dash. It works!! If it continues to run and
keeps time I will permanently mount it in the available dash opening. If not
I'll have to find someone to repair it.
My question is, &quot;What amp fuse should I use for the clock?&quot;
Thanks for the help.
