Subject: Over Heating! '81 Westy

Hello Everyone,
        I know this is a FAQ,  but I think I have tryed everything.
Please read my note and let me know what you think.
        I have a 1981 air cooled Westy with Calif. emisions and fuel
injection.  All of the tin is in place, the seals are in place.  The
compression is 112, 118, 112, 112.  The spark plugs all look good. The the
oil pressure relief valve looked good.  The thermostat is working.  I have
tryed changing the timing, it is retarded relative to stock settings but
when it starts getting hot( above 230 F) I can hear the engine &quot;pinging.&quot;
I have tryed retarding the timing more and using higher octane fuel but my
engine still over heats.  When the engine is cool the van feels strong,
climbs well, no pinging; when it gets hot it loses its power.
        On flat roads doing 55 MPH with air temps of 75 to 80 F, the
engine runs fine, engine temps. of 210 to 220 F.  As soon as we start to
climb so does the the engine temp.  I have been pulling over to cool my
engine when it gets to 270 F.  I had to stop 3 times to get over the North
Cascades Highway.  It is hard to go places with out going over any hills
here in the NW.

        Thank You.
