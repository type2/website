Subject: Power loss. No idle.

Hey all.  Wuz hoping you could help me with something if possible.  :)
About 3 and a half weeks ago I adjusted the fuel air mixture screw on my
Holly 2 barrel. The motor is 2.0 L.  I felt like it was running a bit lean.
I turned it out a turn.  Ok, great.  Everything was fine until last weekend
on the highway I started to notice that for patches of time, maybe 20
seconds, it would feel like power loss and I was getting some high speed
backfiring.  The problem has gotten worse and now I have power loss alot of
the time in every gear, especially on take off, and I can't idle at all.  I
thought, well, I probably have been running too rich.  I took out the #1
spark plug to check how badly it was fouled.  Actually, it wasn't too bad,
just a bit of surface black.  My rotor isn't bad but the brass in the
distributor cap is a little corroded.   
I tried turning the fuel air mixture screw back in a turn but it really
hasn't helped-whatever is fouled is fouled.  Am I having a combination of
problems here - distributor cap/air-fuel mixture wrong?  Like I said, it
deteriorated over the last week or so.  Cant even leave the thing idling to
go around back to adjust anything...it won't stay running!!  My ankles are
getting too old to work both the brake and the accelerator at stoplights!!
Any ideas?  Also, does anyone know the standard setting for the air mixture
screw - out two turns, three...?

Thanks y'all.
