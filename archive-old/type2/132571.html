&gt; As long as your shaft is not wobbling more than 0.050&quot; ( told to me by
&gt; Pertronix engineer) the magnetic collar will not hit the sensor.

You don't want slop along the shaft's axis, either.  Nor do you want 
slop in the advance mechanism.

Personally, I'm in the &quot;if you're distributor is sloppy, replace it and 
rebuild the old one&quot; camp.
