&gt;At the risk of being perceived as offensive, I must interject...
&gt;
&gt;It IS NOT necessary to remove the wing window assembly to replace the window 
&gt;lifter mechanism.

You're right - I had to do it because I was replacing window glass (not 
vent) and a broken vent knob, and decided to lube the lifter mechanism 
while I had it apart - it all sort of ran together in my fading memory... 
 My fault.
