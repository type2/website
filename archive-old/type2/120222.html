Subject: 7 buses in a field

&quot;&quot;Having said that, I WOULD feel more comfortable
knowing that the money I donate is going towards an
inexpensive GOOD reliable daily driver like a Chevy
Corsica, a Grand Am, or even a newer used Ford
Focus.&quot;&quot;
  
---These are good? coulda at least said a good used
Jetta! Chevy Corsica? Puke!

  Anyway I talked with a sand rail nut who has 7
buses in his field.. all bay windows.. no
engine/tranny
in any of them. Anyone in the Seattle area interested
in a project P-mail me.. oh and two are westies.
