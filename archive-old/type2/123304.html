Subject: Re: [T2] cam specs

Karl,

I was hoping you would chime in here!

The best thing that I have come up with is the Desktop dyno
program for the *truly* &quot;black art&quot; of cams.

In the Fisher book, they list several of the cams and specs for them
that were popular at the time that the book was written.  I have 
played with these numbers on desktop dyno and the one that comes out best
every time in almost every configuration that I can think of was the
one listed for &quot;Racer Brown&quot;....unless! you are drag racing for 
money...and don't mind turning 4,000 rpm before you get any torque.

And Karl, the books do all say in the end...  'consult your local cam 
grinder'!!

Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt; What **is** interesting is that the book makes *no*
&gt;  comment about solid v.s. hydraulic specs!...the

&gt; 
&gt; Gee.....  this is what I have been saying all along
&gt; about stock VW cams!
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; The book does state that camshafts for automatic and
&gt;  manual trans engines *are* different ...but it 
&gt;  doesn't say how.
&gt;  
&gt; It is in the Bentley: automatic cams have a cast ring
&gt; on them. Why? No idea.  There is no way to distinguish
&gt; a solid cam from a hydraulic cam.
&gt;  
&gt; your engine out there is an old Isky catalog..... I
&gt; bought every available book on cams and they all said
&gt; 'consult your local cam grinder' in the end.
