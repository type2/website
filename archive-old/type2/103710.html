&gt; Anyone have access to 1/2&quot; thick plastic rod?

Plastruct has acrylic rods in clear and in 4 neon colors (re. blue, green &amp;
yellow).  I believe that the rods are 10&quot; in length.  You can get them
through almost any hobby retailer (hobby shop).

A quick tip on cutting it with a saw: Keep a little bit of water on the
blade to keep the rod cool during cutting.  You'll get granular &quot;sawdust&quot;
instead of melting the rod and bogging the cutting blade down (mind that you
are careful about the water if you use an electrically powered cutting
tool!).
