Subject: Now..the front suspension

The early bay beam ('68-'69?) is a different mounting bolt pattern than the 
later bay beam...right? The later beams have disc brakes (smaller ones on 
'70-'71? then bigger latter). And I guess the later ones came with power 
assist brakes as well.

Other than the disc brakes and different mounting bolt pattern...what are 
the differences in these beams?

Is there a ride difference in the early vs. late bay suspensions?
