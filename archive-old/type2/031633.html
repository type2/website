Hello all,

My girlfriend and i have indeed decided to head to the Pacific northwest
rather than florida.

We will probably be heading through nebraska, to Wyoming, through idaho &amp;
oregon to seattle, WA then back south along the PCH to san francisco and
taking a left to go back to Missouri through nevada etc.

If anyone knows of any good VW shows in the washington state area next
weekend, we'd love to attend, suggestions of great out of the way spots
to camp, or general offers of meeting listees are always welcome.

So, its time to do the final preparations to the bus and head out later
today, after about 4:00 pm CDT my e-mail responses may be delayed from
having to find internet access on the road.

take care,

Steve
