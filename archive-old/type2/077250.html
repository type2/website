Hello again from N.E. Oklahoma,=20
    Progress report on the yard ornament:
Engine pulled and halfway stripped down for a deep cleaning.  In the =
process I discovered a few interesting things the list may be able to =
answwer for me.  In the air tube from the AFM to the air plenum I found =
lots of oil in this tube.  I'm assuming it got there from the old bus =
engine swirl(you know the one that leaves oil on the back hatch) and =
sucked through the AFM.  I haven't gotten into a dissection of the AFM =
yet, but was wondering if it could be cleaned of oily deposits if any =
are found and what solvent would be best for this application.  Also, =
the plenium will probably have its fair share of oil.  Would this affect =
opperation??  Any thoughts or suggestions would be welcome.
    I also need some push on terminals to replace the worn out/corroded =
beyond recongition ones I pulled off yesterday.  They fit on the side =
marker lights and are a small size.  Maybe some vendor knows what I'm =
talking about. =20
    Besides that, it appears that I am going to have to replace the bulk =
of the exhaust on my 78.  The boxes, muffler, tailpipe, and elbows are =
looking questionable if not shot.  Luckily the crossover pipe and the =
manifold appear to be in good conditon.  Whew! =20
    So the tin if off to a friends shop to be cleaned and stripped to =
bare metal.  I following the list advice and coating them with por 15 hi =
temp stuff... Considered painting the cylinders, but am too nervous to =
try it without imperical data. =20
    All in all my bus should be out of service for just another couple =
of weeks, then its back to bussing....

Thanks for reading all this and any thoughts.
