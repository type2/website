Ok, yesterday I went to adjust the valves on my 1600 dp engine and I had
trouble finding finding the firing position on the distributor for the first
cylinder.  As the subject says the distributor doesnt have the wonderful
notch as is shown in the idiots guide.  I turned the engine to where I
thought it should be but I would like to get it done right before the engine
goes back in the bus.  Any suggestions for finding exactly where it is at
without the notch?
Thanks in advance for your help......
