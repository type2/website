Subject: help w/ engine running

I did get my cvarb reworked-- the clip holding float was at the bottle...
UNDER the float and there was dirt in the accelrator nozzle (?).  Now I can
get it to run , but it still soulnds and acts like it's not getting enough
gas.  When I try to drive it, i floor it and can only get a foot ot two.
Would timing have anything to do w/ this? help!
Wes in pullman-- it's a 70 westy camper white bus that's really kool coool
to drive!.
