Subject: Re: [T2] living in a bus in NC

&gt;Also, I am going to begin living in my bus this month and will continue to 
&gt;do so through  the summer.

Search the archives about this topic, it has come up many times.  I think 
the key to living in the bus will be to have a safe place to park, try to 
find a friend that will let you camp outside of their house for small money 
and hopefully give you power.

Good luck and let us know how it goes,

Daniel
