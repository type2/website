This was my advise to Brian (the other Brian) I'm not an expert so I thought
I would send it to everyone just in case I gave some mis-information.

&gt; Brian,
&gt; I can't imagine changing it with out removing the gray gas tank cover. I
&gt; have a carb in mine so it is relatively easy to pull the carb off, unscrew
&gt; the screws that hold the cover on (two hidden on bottom), and then I had
to
&gt; bend my back engine tin in a little bit to pull out the cover (bottom of
&gt; gray cover has to come out 1st). Then remove the round plate and access is
&gt; granted. When I 1st removed the cover last summer I was unaware of the 2
&gt; screws on the bottom. I just thought it was hung up on something. So I
ended
&gt; up prying it out w/ out taking them out. More or less ripping the sheet
&gt; metal at those 2 holes. I never re-attached the 2 bottom screws and not
even
&gt; sure you have access to them w/ the engine in. If you don't want to rip it
&gt; out like I did (took about an hour!) you should ask the list about the
&gt; proper way to remove the gas tank cover.
&gt; Having the back open also lets you check on the small evaporative hoses
that
&gt; run over the tank. One of mine was disconnected causing fumes.
&gt;
&gt; The new elbow attaches like the old and clamp it down. I bought a straight
&gt; piece of gas rated hose for the tank section. Greased it up a little on
both
&gt; ends so it slid around easily on the filler tube and at the gas
tank.There's
&gt; not a lot of room back there so you don't want to be struggling with tight
&gt; rubber on both ends as you have to twist and slide it both ways to get it
&gt; on.  Push the whole unit in through the back. It's long but it fits.  Fish
&gt; the elbow end up and out the opening. I got it to hang up a little at the
&gt; opening, walked around, and carefully grabbed it w/ a pair of needle-nose
&gt; and pulled the outer lip through. At this point I'm not sure if it would
be
&gt; better to screw the elbow to the body or not. I did it last and the holes
&gt; were slightly off, but the rubber was flexible enough to compensate. I
&gt; clamped both ends of the straight piece. Went and bought a new very long
&gt; screw driver so I could really torque them down. Not having the bend at
the
&gt; tank makes the fit less than perfect. No leaks yet though.
&gt;
&gt; I had my engine out which made it a lot easier but I did some
jerry-rigging
&gt; on the old filler neck  last summer with the engine in and it wasn't too
&gt; bad.  I imagine it might be a little more time consuming removing some of
&gt; your FI stuff. But removing the back cover is the first step. I forgot
that
&gt; with the engine out, the gray cover should go back 1st but I put the
engine
&gt; back 1st and ended up having to bend my engine tin in again! Other than
that
&gt; it was a smooth operation. Of course I'm comparing it to my 1st engine
drop
&gt; that I was doing concurrently, getting the engine out by myself, fried
pilot
&gt; bearing, shot starter.........I'm a teacher too. I teach art at Southern
&gt; Utah University. There were a few moments of despair were I was
approaching
&gt; tears and wondering what the HELL I was doing and why I didn't take it to
a
&gt; mechanic! I'm a better Bus owner now. An education can be painful, but
&gt; priceless.
&gt;
&gt; Good Luck,

&gt; &gt; Hello!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;      I am now the proud owner of a brand spanking new filler neck elbow
&gt; &gt; for my '78 Transporter.  Can someone who's replaced this part tell me
how
&gt; &gt; it's done?  I can't figure out how to reach the hose clamp!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;      Thank you,  Brian
