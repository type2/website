Subject: Re: [T2] Jump start blues!

RED DOESN'T GO TO NEGATIVE, RED GOES TO PLUS!!!!!!!  Beat that in your
head over and over and over!  And then one more time!

I think it's probably safe to say that red is always positive, except in
some special wiring situations, but more often than not, it is positive!

Don't hook it up the other way unless you want to FRY everything.  If
you have any radio's or other devices, those are prone to FRY too!!  My
friend fried his amp by hooking it up backwards.. that was a costly
mistake.

The negative terminal should be hooked up to the ground wire.  That is
the wire that goes straight to the chassis.

And when you hook up an extra jumper battery, you hook + to + and - to
-, not the other way.  By doing this, you put the batteries and parallel
and increase the amps available to the starter.

I'd first hook your battery up the correct way.  Hook up the wiring
harness with all the red cables on it (and a big fat (probably black)
one that goes to the starter) to the positive(+) terminal and the other
braided one that goes to the chassis to negative (-).

put in the new one, and test out the voltage at different points in the
car.  Fuse box is probably a good place.  You should have 12v on your
meter.  This is with the key off.

Then try and see if the car will start.  If it does, go and test the
voltage again and it should be running at around 13.7 volts.  If it is,
your voltage regulator is still working correctly.  If it's higher, then
it's not working.  I don't know the reprocussions of having a bad
regulator so be careful..

I don't how else you'd check your regulator, but I'm sure if I missed
something that someone else will chime in.

good luck!
Mike

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; Lurker named Milo here.  I've got a problem in my '69
&gt; Westy that
&gt; I probably shouldn't have, but nonetheless - I do...
&gt; 
&gt; I left it at a friend's house for a few weeks, came
&gt; back, and the
&gt; battery was dead.  Simple enough I thought - I hooked
&gt; jumpers up
&gt; to it from my car and it started right up.  But as
&gt; soon as I unhooked
&gt; the jumpers, it died.  This is stange I thought!  So
&gt; off I run to the
&gt; store, fork over some bread for a new battery, and
&gt; think - I hate
&gt; buying a new battery but this is simple enough, quit
&gt; complaining...
&gt; Little was I to know!
&gt; 
&gt; I get back, and notice that the red cable in the back
&gt; of my bus is
&gt; indeed, hooked up to the negative terminal, and that
&gt; when I jump
&gt; started it, I had the + from the car hooked up the -
&gt; of the bus, and
&gt; vise-versa....  Well, that explains why she wouldn't
&gt; stay running.
&gt; And man, was that battery hot when I took it out of
&gt; the bus!
&gt; 
&gt; After second guessing myself a few times, I conclude
&gt; beyond a reasonable
&gt; doubt that yes - the red should go to the negative
&gt; terminal, etc.  Man,
&gt; was that hard to do though!  Something about hooking
&gt; red up to negative
&gt; that really goes against the grain ya know.
&gt; 
&gt; My problem is this.  My red light is now on, and I
&gt; seem to recall
&gt; somewhere that what I've just done is reversed the
&gt; &quot;charge&quot; in the
&gt; generator - not sure if that was Muir, Usenet, the
&gt; list, etc.  But
&gt; I seem to recall reading this.  The archives couldn't
&gt; bear this out
&gt; however.  Hell, maybe I dreamed it sometime, but it's
&gt; my hunch.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone have any suggestions from previous experience?
&gt; Did I fry my
&gt; Voltage Regulator, ruin my generator, or just put a
&gt; magnetic hex
&gt; on the gennie that could be removed by a shop w/ the
&gt; right type
&gt; of magnet.  Any and all suggestions would be greatly
&gt; appreciated!
&gt; 
&gt; Geez, if I'd have just shut the key all the way off
&gt; before taking
&gt; off that one night none of this would have
&gt; happened.... *sighs*
&gt; 
&gt; THANKS!  Milo
