Subject: sherlock freakin' holmes (was hit &amp; run)

ok, so i went back out to the scene &amp; found some taillight pieces that
definitely didnt come from a bus.

part of it says &quot;toyota&quot; &amp; i found 2 other small sections with part #s on
them.
they are:
35-32 SAE APP2 87

53131-89118   A1    R

any idea where i can find out what vehicle these parts #s go to? have tried
various internet search engines &amp; no luck.

sorry this may be pushing the limit of no bus content but i really want to
find out who did this to my bus!

TIA!
