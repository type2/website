Subject: Dual port Dizzy test question

I put my old dual point back. A shop told me it was OK, but I think not. 
The bus idled pretty good but had no acceleration. I did the test of moving 
the points tray counterclockwise. It snapped back. When I did the same test 
and blocked off the vacuum inlet valves it still snapped back. This I guess 
means the vacuum pot is bad?

Am I right about this?
If so does any one have a good vacuum pot out there?

Thanks 
tom
