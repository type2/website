Subject: Re: cv joint socket size and ?s

        Actually, Liquid Wrench is WAY thinner than WD-40 and will
penetrate AMAZINGLY deep via capilary action. Yes, you have to douse
the head of the fastener but it will finds its way down the threads
if given a chance. Of course, working from the thread side is far
preferable if you can get there.

        Regarding CV bolts in particular, I got all but 3 out of 24
on my '70. My beloved brother ducked under, THOROUGHLY cleaned out
the hex 'pocket' in each head and removed the other three without
difficulty. Moral: There is NO substitute for cleaning everything 
BEFORE you start, and as you work.

        On the installation side:
        I had a bit of trouble with my new CV bolts, with anti-sieze,
backing out... but then again I'd just a normal allen key to tighten them
and couldn't vouch for the torque really applied. Bob Hoover suggested
cleaning out the threads in the hub and final drive with a .22 bore brush
and plenty of solvent, and then using a Loc-Tite product. I haven't
done that, but I did buy a real 6mm socket so I can apply real, and
repeatable, torque. I'll re-torque with it and then check 'em.
        I had no problems with the 6 Rabbit CVs I've done using the
correct tool, but it was a borrowed, correct, tool, and I faked it on
Little Martha. Foolish, of course.

        Cheers!
        Bill
