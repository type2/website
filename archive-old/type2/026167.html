There's a technology called ceramic coating that really works.  Its used in
the boating arena to keep salt water from destroying exhaust components.  I
had a Type 3 muffler done a couple years ago down around Ventura for about
$150 and it still looks new.  I figure I could go through several mufflers
by the time this one dies so the money was well spent.  There's a company
called Jet Hot or something like that who supposedly can also do this
coating.

&gt; 
&gt; I bought a German OEM type muffler for the '67 about 5 months ago. I live
&gt; in 
&gt; Southern California where there's no road salt or snow danger, just a bit
&gt; of 
&gt; rain now and then, but within one month of use, the grey paint on my 
&gt; muffler, damper pipe and tailpipe has burnt off, and rust is starting to 
&gt; form on these parts, not to mention it looks like a big booger at the back
&gt; 
&gt; of my bus.
&gt; 
&gt; I was figuring I'd get some high heat spraypaint at the FLAPS and recoat 
&gt; them. Has anyone done this with success?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm about to do a resto on another bus and buy another muffler, should I 
&gt; strip this paint off before &quot;high-heat&quot; painting them?
&gt; Any other alternatives?
&gt;
