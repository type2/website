Subject: Fuel Lines???

Hey guys,

	I took your advice and replaced my fuel lines a couple weeks ago.
BUT... I had a thought. Wouldn't it be better if I replaced 90% of the
tubing with steel fuel lines? I can buy those fuel lines from the local auto
parts store and I have the tools to... mandrel bend them (if that's the
correct term). 

Has anyone done that? It seems like it would be much better to do it right
than have to replace the rubber hoses all the time. If my car was all
original, then I'd keep it stock. But the original owner chose to REPLACE
the motor, rather than rebuild it... soo.... it's not exactly stock anymore.



Thanks,
