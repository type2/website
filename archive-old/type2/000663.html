&gt; Well, I've been listening to my 79 bus get louder and louder out the back
&gt; end, and I'm realizing (and have been told) that I'm in need of a new
&gt; muffler.  Basically, what is the best route to take in terms of replacing


Since I've covered this before on these pages (so it is in the archives),
I'll provide an abbreviated answer re your choices for a '79-83 exhaust.
Stock system includes a crossover pipe, cat, separate muffler and tailpipe.
These parts are available separately or I have them as a system.  All on the
website.  If you don't have a cat now, chances are you have some sort of
aftermarket (or stock pre-'75) system on your bus. There are a large number
of incompatable cheapo extractor systems out there, and replacing just part
of one is not adviseable; first of all, it can be hard to find the correct
one, and secondly they're not the best quality so if one piece is rusting
out chances are the rest is as well.  Best non-catalyst option for a '79-83
is the stock '72-74 bus system, which is a direct bolt-on.  I have a
complete Dansk system for $159.95, which I recommend highly.  Cheapest
alternative that I'd put on my own bus is a one-piece Pacesetter system for
$99.95.
