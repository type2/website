&gt;  I have both an alternator (3 prong external voltage regulator) and a
&gt;  generator for my new engine, and I was wondering whats the difference
&gt;  between the two?  And why There are no more generators out there anymore in
&gt;  newer vehicles.
&gt;  The driving force behind this question is that my bus is already wired for 
a
&gt;  generator, why try to figure out the alternator electrical?
&gt;  Thanks Chad

in a dynamo the field coils rotate inside stationary magnets. In an 
alternator the magnets rotate inside stationary field coils.

The dynamo needs higher revs to begin producing its charge and it produces 
less of it. For the vw 1600 flat 4 a dynamo produces 30Amp and an aternator 
55Amps

Dynamos are no longer used because moderns cars have powerfull lights, 
radios, heated seats, heated windows, electronic brains etc etc and therefore 
need a generator which is more powerful (within the size constraints) than a 
dynamo could be.

So to fit a dynamo instead of an alternator would be needless downgrading of 
your vehicle.

Good luck
