        Les,
        Its never too late to have a happy childhood. I didn't start
seriously fooling with cars until I was in my 30s and I've made about
every mistake I could think of and its a blast. Do it. Front wheel
bearings are a perfectly fine place to start.

        Make sure that's the problem by jacking up the front wheel
and spinning the tire and doing the wheel-bearing test in Muir-
does the wheel move in or out noticably? (&gt; 1/64&quot; or .3mm) Its
possible that cleaning, re-greasing and correct reassembly and adjustment
will fix the problem, but bearing replacement is likely from the noise
you describe, and not much more effort or expense.

        Allow plenty of time. Start first thing Saturday morning. Then you
can take your parts to FLAPS or the dealer or whomever and make sure
you get exactly what you need.
        Work carefully. Clean and baggie parts, or clean and lay them out
where they won't be disurbed.
        Do one side at a time. You can always check to see how it goes
back together by looking at the other side
        Invest in tools: No junk, and no Crescent wrenches unless you
have no alternative. EXCELLENT quality slotted and Philips head
screw drivers, 10mm, 13mm, 15mm, 17mm and 19mm, 3/8&quot; drive sockets 
and combination (open-end at one end, closed 'box' end at the other) 
wrenches are most of what you need. The big nut that holds the wheel
hub onto the spindle may be bigger than 19mm- check the manual.
        A rubber mallet for the dust-cap over the bearing is nice.
        A brass drift for driving bearing races out of where they are 
now is good investment. A brass drift is either a 'tool' you pay $6
for or 1/4 of a brass bar you pay $6 for. Use a hack-saw to cut
the bar into 9&quot; sections and give the rest to friends as Christmas
presents. No matter how hard you whack a brass drift into a piece of
steel, the brass, not the steel, gives.
        You may need a large Allen-key to remove brake caliper bolts.

        Get a mirror and a bright light so you can see EVERYTHING as you
work on it. Have a sketch book and a pencil handy to draw how it goes
as you take things apart.

        Friend: Muir calls for one in the Phase I tool kit I believe
and its a good call. Someone who's in your corner. Nicer if its
someone who knows more than you who will watch and advise and help
you learn, not do it for you. A Friend can be a complete novice too.
It sometimes helps to have someone to say %*$%)#$(*&amp;)#$ to, so you're
not talking to yourself. 

        It doesn't hurt to start by having a couple of good manuals-
three in fact: Haynes, Bentley and Muir. Muir is good for atmosphere
and alternate explanations. Haynes is surprisingly user-friendly
for the non-expert, and their' photos are the same old and sometimes
greasy views you get on your own wheels. Bentley is the Official Word
but not always pitched to the novice, and the pictures are all impossibly
clean. 

        That said, learn first to CLEAN what you are going to work on 
before you start, or during if needs be. 

        Later you'll learn to be thorough, fast and neat. For starters,
settle on thorough. Buy paper towels, a box of disposable latex or vinyl
'exam' gloves and some citrus based hand-cleaner. With the gloves, you
probably don't need the pumice version of the hand-cleaner.

        Put a paper-towel roll-holder just inside the garage door, over 
the bench or near the light switch (heck all three if you're feeling 
rich- they're $1.19 each, towels not included). Get a trash-can for
the greasy/hand-cleanerly papertowels.

        You can clean the car, including the underside where you're
going to work, using a stiff brush and soap and water. For really
greasy stuff, non-pumice citrus hand cleaner is my choice, although
Foamy Engine Brite from Gunk or similar work well too. The brush is
VERY important. We're not in spray-on/wash-off territory.

        Don't spooge anything except soap and water between
the brake pads and the front rotors, however.

        Note that your rinse-off water goes down some drain
somewhere unless you rinse over your own yard. You may not legally
dump the spray-on stuff down storm drains. Does that stop anybody? 
Well, it should, but probably doesn't. Heck, you're not supposed
to let soap and water go down a storm drain. I'd rinse hand-cleaner
off on my lawn before I'd rinse Foamy Engine Brite on the lawn, if you
follow me.

        In the case of your front wheel bearings, there will be brake 
dust and road grime on the wheel, hub and suspension. Clean what you 
can with the wheel on. Block the rear wheels (four bricks or blocks,
one on each side of each rear wheel) and remove the wheel, then lower
the jacked-up front onto a nice jack-stand. You may enjoy the process
more if you can find a way to clean-up the hub and suspension sans wheel.
Wash-off the inside of the wheel/tire as long as you're at it.

        A nice piece of 1x4 makes a dandy pad between the jack-stand
(or floor jack) and the chassis of your bus. If you use the tire-changing
jack to raise the car, you can put the jack-stand under the most logical
strong place. If you use a floor-jack to raise the car, IT goes in the
most logical strong place and you'll need to put the stand under the
NEXT most logical strong place. 

        It doesn't hurt to stow the loose tire UNDER the car, near
the jack stand, so that if the jack stand failed, the wheel would
keep the car from going all the way down to the ground.

        Now you're ready to do the procedure in whatever book you
follow. Figure out how stuff works as you go, and don't be
afraid to play with things. Spin the disc and hub and have Friend
apply the brakes
        Don't have someone stomp the brakes with the caliper OFF the 
disc, however

        I usually replace the dust cap as well as the cotter pin
AND the bearings. Sometimes the shiny new dust cap can't be made
to fit, and the old mucky looking one with the dent in it does fit.
Life is like that.

        You can do one side at a time without affecting or involving
the other side. If you change the brake pads, and there won't be
an easier time to do that job, you WILL want to do both sides at
the same time however. And if one bearing is worn out, chances are
not only BOTH bearings on that wheel are worn out BUT BOTH bearings
on the OTHER SIDE are worn out too.

        With the wheel gone and you looking around is a good time
to visually inspect the steering and suspension joints, shocks, etc.
Look for loose or broken things, fluids dripping, shiny places
where some metal is wearing against something else. The rubber
brake hose is nice and supple and has not nicks or cuts or kinks, right?

        This is also a good time to bleed the brakes if you're so
inclined, or at least make sure the little bleeder nipple caps
are installed and snug.

        What fun!
        Happy motoring!
