Melissa (and Mike),
The table shown in Shawn Bartnik's jpg is probably from a later model year, 
if authenticity is important to you. Our 75's table doesn't have the folding 
leaf, is 21x31 inches, doesn't have a strap/retainer for storage on the 
deck, and appears to have a beafer support tube (1 and 3/8 in. diameter). 
But the idea is the same. Your support tube is likely an  original. I can 
provide a xerox of the Westy manual for a '75 if you'ld like to see it for 
reference in your restoration project. Just email me an address.
Roland
