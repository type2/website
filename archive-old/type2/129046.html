Subject: Re: [T2] timing the SVDA

What year engine do you have?  Is it stock?  Check the code on your 
engine and verify with the bentley manual as to what you want your 
timing set at for your engine.  I believe you want to set your timing 
according to your engine model, not your distributor type.  Hopefully 
someone else can confirm this.

What I meant about pulling the vacuum line making it like an 009 is that 
an 009 is essentially a SVDA without the vacuum canister.  The vacuum 
line gives you advance when you open the throttle (009s didn't have 
this); that's why they bog when you press on the gas.  Do make sure that 
you're pulling the vacuum feed from the correct location on your carb.

Also, are you timing this statically?  I would pull out your timing 
light to verify that you're getting your numbers correct.  Then check 
your total advance.  Maybe someone else can also verify the correct 
total *mechanical* (no hose) advance for that engine.

&gt; Within the distributor, I changed from points to Compufire electronic
&gt; ignition (thats why I got the new coil), installed by Aircooled (so I
&gt; couldn't gum it up). I verified the plug wires, and they're correct
&gt; (thanks, tho). I probably hosed the idle by modifying the carb settings
&gt; after installing the dizzy. The documentation that was sent indicated
&gt; 7.5BTDC static timing, and then to tweak the carb as necessary. If
&gt; pulling the vaccuum hose makes it operate like the 009, then should
&gt; timing trend towards the old setting (5ATDC)? I guess I need a little
&gt; clarity: what defines the static timing setting, the dizzy or the rest
&gt; of the components?
