&gt; Here's another one for you.  What is the purpose of

&gt; near the top edge of the 
&gt; pedal when it is pressed to the floor.  Can anyone
&gt; clue me in?

That one's bothering me, too. There are corresponding
holes, connected by a slit, in the rubber floor mat of
my '69, too. I've noticed that removing the rubber mat
allows for a little more accelerator pedal travel,
too. But I figure that if VW wanted that much travel,
they'd have built it in in the first place, so I
haven't butchered my mat...yet ;-) 

Anyone? Anyone???
