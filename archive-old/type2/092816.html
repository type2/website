Subject: Re: [T2] intro, tires, towing, etc.


&gt;I read the tire FAQs and this tire was
&gt;listed, but the person had only one on their bus, not all four.

I've got one substandard tire on my bus too - one the spare tire... &lt;grin&gt;

Seriously - sounds like good tires but the overall rolling diameter will be 
slightly smaller than stock. SLIGHTLY.

&gt;Sooo, I'll get these tires, bring them to the Westy, put the Westy on 
&gt;stands and take
&gt;the rims and tires to a local shop for mount/balance, put them back on the
&gt;westy and uses a come-a-long to get the bus onto the car transport.  Does
&gt;anyone have a better idea?

Short of borrowing wheels and tires - you have the right idea. Too bad you 
can't paint the wheels before you mount the tires.

I'd just put it on a flatbed trailer as is - and wait to install the tires 
when you get home. They won't hold air for even a few minutes while you 
load it?

&gt;Also, the bus has no access to the engine compartment, small-ish tail lights
&gt;and looks like a '71.  But, it has a pancake engine.  Could it be a 72
&gt;instead?  Or could someone have put a pancake engine into it?

Transition period bus?

Maybe Euro spec? Many of the improvements showed up in Europe 1 year before 
America. I had an Italian-spec '72 Super that was like a '73 American spec 
Beetle when I was in Italy. A '72 American spec Beetle still had a flat 
windshield.

Congrats on a good deal.
