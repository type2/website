Subject: Re: funky gunk in oil filler


This stuff is often reffered to on the lists as &quot;mayonnaise&quot;. You are
correct, it is emulsified oil/water. It comes from making too many short
trips at low ambient air temps. There are several good explanations in the
archives as to why your crankcase tends to condense water, you might search
for &quot;condensation&quot; or something.

The cure is to take it out on the highway and let it breathe for a while.
At least let it warm up longer in the driveway. It needs heat to boil the
water off.

&gt;HI VOLKS!  Ok,here's my problem.My camper('70 w/a '71 type1 engine) is
&gt;having a problem w/ the crankcase ventilation system.The oil filler tube
&gt;and tube going to the air filter contain some funky gunk,tan in
&gt;color(possibly f/moisture and oil mixing while engine breathes).
