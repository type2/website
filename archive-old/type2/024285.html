I’ve driven my first year and put 6000 on the clock as a new owner so I thought that this is the time for plugs/points/condenser change.  Or should I wait for 12000 miles  to go by, as mentioned in Haynes manual?  The number on my distributor is 043 905 205L, is this the famous 009?  If not, what distributor do I quote for the correct parts?  I’m reading Muir and Haynes manuals.  Haynes says “The distributor should be removed only if indications are such that it needs renewal or overhaul”.  Muir’s procedure mentions removing the distributor for replacement of points.  As did Bob Hoover, If I remember rightly.  I don’t like disturbing things unless I have to, what do I go for?  Also, do I clean/reset plugs or is it best to renew at this stage?  The engines running fine but I’m thinking that maintenance at certain lengths of time/mileage is best.  Thanks to all who answered my nipples posting, five nipples it was and Bosch grease to the column noise.
