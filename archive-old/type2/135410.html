Subject: Re: [T2] Refurbished?

&lt;&lt; Anyone know whether anybody has tried to provide &quot;refurbished&quot; buses 
(or any vehicle, for that matter)? It would be nice to go to a 
refurbisher -- not a restorer -- and buy a baywindow for, say, $6000 to 
$10000 with maybe a two-year parts and labor guarantee.

If someone did this is large quantities, it ought to be possible. 
 &gt;

Define &quot;refurbished&quot; ? A two year warranty on a minimally 25
year old vehicle would be enough to eat up the original profit.
Also, a single site warranty would be pretty worthless unless
you lived close to the site.
