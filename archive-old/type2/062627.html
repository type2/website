&gt; &gt; Electric vests?  Like battery powered socks?
&gt; &gt; My fiance would be VERY interested in that!

        You're all nuts ;) , but in my experience, it's keeping your
extremities warm that is most difficult.  Having a toasty abdomen &amp;
freezin' toes makes me 100% miserable. :(  (Don't remind me; it's still
July!!!)
