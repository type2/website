&gt; It advances just fine. The plate somehow became warped ( I assume when 
&gt; it was rebuilt). The points somehow teeter-totter on there so 
&gt; adjustments are nearly impossible.

Hmm.. that's kinda weird.  Well, it's not that hard to take the breaker 
plate off.  I think you just need to unscrew it and then spin both 
plates so they clear the side grooves and then slide it out.  Then you 
can look at the mounting from the side and see if it is really warped or 
something else that's interfering with the points.
