&gt; My wife reports a strong smell of gas around the bus,

&gt; There is no leak that I can see, and the bus has been
&gt; parked for a month on a dry floor in an unheated  garage
&gt; (it is in for the winter as I do not expose the old girl
&gt; to road salt).  Neither the engine compartment nor the
&gt; floor show wet.

sounds like the vent tube connectors have given out common problem, when
you go around a corner with a fairly full tank a little gas will come out.
look on the top of the engine compartment and you may see small plastic
tubes maybe 3/8 in. follow these tubes and reach up into the air intake
duckts on either side and you can feel some flexible connectors that fail
with age, repair with small pieces of gas line
