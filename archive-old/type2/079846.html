Subject: The Home of Chrome

Greetings All,

I have a 1970 Deluxe Bus from which I need to remove all chrome.  It's going 
in for a paint job.  Of course I'll have the Bentley by my side as I go 
through this operation.  But.....................I was wondering if any of 
you bus-savvy types who have removed chrome from your rigs have any juicy 
little tips on how to do it easier or better?  And....................Any 
other &quot;before the too expensive paint job&quot; ideas?

Always looking for practical knowledge!

Mike
