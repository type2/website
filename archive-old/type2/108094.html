Subject: 2 Sliding Door Questions

I've been trying a number of our repro sliding door handles on our own bus,
and during the process, discovered that the rearward latching mechanism
needed to be adjusted.  But, about 0.5&quot; of the end of the adjusting
nut/shaft thing on part #46 (MF #075-00) was broken off.

There were enough threads left to adjust the latch to where I could open the
door somewhat easily, but in the process I discovered why the original VW
OEM handle shattered into a dozen pieces.  Hmm... Rocky... guess that I
don't know my own strength...

I looked at microfiche #075-00 and discovered that there were apparently two
adjusting mechanisms for the sliding door latch.  The one that I have, #46,
and another, made up of parts #48 &amp; #48A.

Any opinions on which is a better solution?  Part #28 was already broken,
but if I get the #48 combo, #28 seems not to be needed.  (Actually, the #48
combo looks like it can be fabricated out of Home Depot supplies.)

I also discovered that those metric security bolts used to mount license
plates are the right size and length to replace a missing bolt that holds
the main sliding door latch to the door.

Second question, the handle in our bus is part #16.  But there's another
handle, part #16A.  Is it that odd shape so that it automatically unlocks
the door by hitting the locking button when the handle is rotated to open
the door.  Just wondered.

By the way, the repro handle works.
