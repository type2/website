Greetings all,

	I had a stroke of good luck the other day.  My '72 
westy came with a 1600DP installed by the PO.  I've been rebuilding that motor 
with the intention of running that this summer.  In the mean time I've been 
keeping an eye out for a type IV motor that I could eventually install for 
better power.
	I noticed and ad the other day &quot; '74 1800cc VW bus motor, basket case&quot;.  I call
the guy and we meet. He has the motor in his car all in pieces.  I turns out he 
had rebuilt the motor and then let is sit for at least a year in the back of a 
dune buggy, outside.  The thing pretty well rusted up on him.  Rather than tear 
it down again he filled it up with transmission fluid and tow started it.  It 
didn't work.  The rear bearing failed and the motor locked up.
	The case is O.K., the heads look new, the cylinders are scored, most of the 
stuff is there, so I offer him $80 and he takes it.  As I'm loading it up in my 
car I see assembly lube in the oil holes of the crank.  There is assembly lube 
in most of the case parts.  I ask the guy about it and he admits the rebuild 
never ran.    I say, &quot;Ouch, man.&quot; He says, &quot;Yeah.&quot;  So he's done with it and 
it's my turn.
	So I get it all home and take a look and here's the deal. It's not a '74 
1800cc, it's a 1700cc, probably '72.  Cool.  Case prefix is CB, pistons are 
89.97mm .  Just a few odd pieces missing. Heads are new. The carbs are really 
dirty, but complete.  The bearing messed the crank up a little, but I think not 
to bad.  I am amazed that the bearing didn't spin.  The weird thing is that the 
pistons and cylinders are really messed up, like he tried to get by with old 
stuff.
	So now I have the right motor and I also have my work cut out.  This thing 
looks more like a real motor compared to my 1600DP.  I see a lot of things that 
are strange to me and I'll have plenty of questions.
	The first question is, if these are 1700cc heads, will 1800cc cylinders fit on 
the motor without machining?
	 The second is, does anyone make replacement tin to fit around the heat 
exchangers?  These look almost doable compared to the upright jobs.

Lots more questions later.
