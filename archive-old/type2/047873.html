Subject: [T2]  Turbo on TypeII- Follow on Question

Hi all,

I found this thread really interesting with regards to the cooling aspect.
Can anyone out there compare the turbo setup (cooling and powerwise) to the
old judson supercharger installation for the 36 and 40 HP motors? I'm
thinking of the fact that the Judson setups have the marvel oiler as well
which is said to both lubricate and reduce operating temps. 

I realize that this may be more of a vintage bus question but enquiring
minds want to know....;-) Please P-mail instead if you feel the reply is not
appropriate content for the list.

TIA,
