Subject: GEX Motor Demons?

Hi All,
I've got a dilemma facing me. I'm looking at buying a 1982 Westy with
135,000 miles on it. PO took very good care it. He decided to put a rebuilt
motor in it about 7000 miles ago. He bought a GEX built motor and installed
it himself.  He then took the bus on it's annual summer trip (had about
3000 miles on the newly rebuilt engine). Well  the heads on his new
creation gave out while traveling through Iowa. GEX refused to warranty
anything because he did the install himself. Not wanting to make the same
mistake twice he had Jerry's Bug Shop (?) in Iowa rebuild the heads and
install new pistons in the GEX case. He then drove the van home and has put
some 4000 miles on the new, new engine rebuild since then.

When I came on the scene all assumptions were that the new, new engine was
holding up fine and I was excited at not having to worry about it when
making my purchasing decision. Well come to find out when I took it to get
the compression checked that the compression is bad (#1 I believe) and the
rings are likely shot.  The owner of the vehicle (not me as of yet) was
very saddened by this news and offered to sell the van to me at a greatly
reduced rate (basically took out the price of a top end rebuild and a
little more).

My mechanic is telling me that GEX is bad news in general and that it's
possible that there is &quot;something&quot; about the case/cam etc that is
destroying heads/rings et al.

As I am not a mechanic I'm having a tough time making an informed decision
about the option available.

A) Buy the van  and have a top end rebuild done  (estimated $1600). This
has appeal because it's the cheaper of the two scenarios. But if there is
&quot;something&quot; about this GEX case/cam etc. which is causing the motor to run
hot or otherwise self destruct I'd rather go with choice B.

B) Buy the van and put a whole new rebuilt motor (estimated $2800)

C) Bail on the purchase and go through the summer sans Westy.

The mechanic I'm dealing with (Verner of Verner's in Boulder, CO) has a
really good reputation locally and seems to  be a real straight shooter but
he says if we do the top end rebuild he won't warranty any of the work (he
sites the GEX lineage as the basis for the decision)

I'm leaning towards a complete new rebuild for a little peace of mind but I
really would like to know what it could be in this GEX  case which could
destroy two engines in less than 7000 miles.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Ian
