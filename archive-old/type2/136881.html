Subject: Re: [T2] Department of how bad ...

&lt;Never fall off, but blew a Fram seal on the way to the shop one morning in 
Texas...it was barely freezing.&gt;

Honda issued a recall to CR-V owners (we have a '99 we bought new) because some shops will remove the old filter and install the new not realizing the old filter's seal is still stuck on the engine. Honda did not mention any brands of filters involved though I know their factory filter was/is Dana (WIX). Maybe some filters (presumably the brands the quickie change places like to use) let go of their seal easier than others. My DANA filters have never let go of a seal yet in 100K miles. 

I bought a dozen factory filters from an Internet wholesaler back when I bought my Honda. Came in blue with Honda stamped all over but inside I noticed a DANA symbol. 

ANYHOW (ramble, ramble) the filter is situated right over the header pipe so the leaking oil can ignite on that very hot part of the exhaust. 

Would seem the same could happen to our VWs. 

Am a devout believer in WIX/DANA filters for the past 6 years. They are more expensive. Do not know if they have the anti-drainback valve of the Mann/Mahle filter. I use the Mann filter on my '97 Cabrio. Haven't changed the oil in our bus for 5-6 years. Haven't driven it during that period either! &lt;grin!&gt; 

Of course now it is Corvair powered...
