Subject: I'm frustrated!

Hi folks,
I was driving along last night when all of a sudden the clutch pedal
hits the floor when shifting.  I limp the '70 westy into a Dunkin
Dounut's parking lot.  Climb underneath and see that the clutch cable is
frayed and hanging on by a strand.  While Emma my 16 month old is
snoozing away, I replace the clutch cable.  The clutch would not
engage.  It was getting dark and I decided to limp the bus home.
Started him in second and only stalled once.  I started to think about
what happened last October to my other westy.  One of the arms that hold
the throw out bearing snapped.  Having a day to think about it.  I might
have not adjusted the wingnut enough.  How much is the arm on the tranny
suppose to move?
