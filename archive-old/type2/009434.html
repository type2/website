&gt;I assumed the notch in my fan was at 0degrees, but maybe it's really 5?  At
times like &gt;this I realize how little I really know about VW engines...

Looking down thru the fan housing access hole as you hand turn the engine 
you will see a black line come accross the notch. When it is lined up in the
apex of the notch the engine is at  5 degrees before top dead center. There
is also a red line but I am not sure what it is for. Anybody know? In the
case of the 1972 bus(1700cc, CB case, 009, Weber 32/36) it likes to be timed
a little high. I set it about 34 to 36 total advance. I have tested it set a
little higher and it has more power but I have always set it back cause I am
chicken :)
