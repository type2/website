Subject: Re: bus security (paranoids exposed)

&gt;&gt; This is my personal strategy.  Well, the unlocked, key in ignition (most of
&gt;&gt; the time), dirty, full of stuff tactic has worked well.  Once in a while I
&gt;&gt; vacuum and get everything clean, but the stuff just has no where else to
&gt;&gt; go.  My car always looks like someone's living in there.
&gt;
&gt;Hell, I really can't go with this at all.  I figure that if you've got
&gt;something as beautiful as a vintage bus, then you want to keep it
&gt;beautiful; well, maybe that's just me...?
&gt;
&gt;If you keep your bus lloking like shit, you obviously don't take a great
&gt;deal of pride in it, or respect for it...if you don't respect your bus,
&gt;then why do you subscribe to this list...?

Sorry to offend anyone.  It really was mostly a joke.  The outside of my
car is as nice as I can keep it.  The inside is pretty good too, except for
the mess.  See, I live in a tiny dorm room and I have to use my car as a
storage area to keep everything I have that won't fit in my room.  The
garbage is just normal from driving it every day and being lazy about
picking up straw wrappers and whatnot when I get out of my bus.  I do take
pride in my bus, and I love thinking about and doing things to make her
better and keep her beautiful.  Yet, my bus is not my life and I have other
things going on, some of which include music, hobbies, pets, and making
enough money to cover my debts- all of which end up cluttering up my bus.
It won't always be this way, and it wasn't always this way (Like when I was
living at home and had a much bigger space to deal with).  Alright, enough
bandwidth about this!  (But its true, having a cluttery car does help when
making would-be theifs think nothing in your car is worth anything)
