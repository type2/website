Subject: Busses by the Sea UPDATE!!!  Important new info.... read!

Busses by the Sea planning seems to have gone off without a hitch.  For
those needing more information, just go to http://vw.illequipped_dot_com


I've been informed that there is no more saturday Oceanside reservations
available.
Anyone who has allready made reservations at assateague needs to email me
with your reservation info. 

1.  Are you on Oceanside or Bayside?
2.  Where are you coming from?  
3.  Are you camping with one vehicle at your site or 2?  
4.  Are you willing to share your site with another vehicle? (only 2
vehicles per site).   
5.  Are you intested in organizing a caravan meeting from points north,
south and west of the island?  
6.  Are you planning on bringing any food for the potluck on saturday night?
(meat or vegetarian)  utensils or plates?
7.  Will you be able to bring firewood?


It is really important I get all this info.  I'm gonna start the process of
getting all the sites grouped together.
Please remember that Bayside camping is still available but you must reserve
a space soon.  Campsites are very limited.
