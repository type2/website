Subject: Re: [T2] Cal-spec fuel filler neck and SMOG

&gt; I do have a California-spec van, so I need all the
&gt; stuff.  :-(

Instead of asking a world-wide list of people, of which at least 90% do not
have a clue as to how the Calif. smog check program works, why don't you go
down to your local test station and get a pre-check done?

You will get a printout of your test results and what you need to get the
vehicle in compliance. Whether you need everything that was on the bus when it
was built is up to the tech inspecting it. He may have a blind eye or go by
the book. You may feel that a tech having a blind eye is what you want, but 9
times out of 10
he also has a blind eye when you want repairs done..... like when he does a
'tune-up' and just replaces points but neglects to check timing. ALL the
emission systems on your 77 work hand in hand with each other. When each one
works as designed, the vehicle runs correctly.

You do NOT want to become a gross pollutor. From your local test/repair
station you will have to go to a test-only station and then to the Referee.
The Referee is 100% BY-THE-BOOK.

It appears as though you are asking questions until you get the answer you
want to hear. Problem with that is, no one here can issue you a smog
certificate!
