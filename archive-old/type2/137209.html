Yes you have to do what you are comfortable with. There is certainly nothing
wrong with doing it right! :-) Once you've cursed and sworn over an easy out
 or broken stud, you tend to use a torque wrench a whole lot more.

Take care,

Courtney

Despite the fact that my last name was Anglicized in the

seventeen-hundreds, I guess I'm still German enough that I want to look

at an instrument rather than trust my wrist, which didn't do its

homework and skipped classes to hang out with the other wrists.

&gt; In all honesty mark, anything that low of torque, I just use an

&gt; torque.

&gt; Of course I've wrenched for years, and I am def. NOT Arnold

&gt; Swcharzeger .
