Subject: Hydraulic lifters in an early Type IV case?

        After all the talk on the list about replacing pushrod tubes, I 
checked mine.  Leaky.  I was wondering if I could also replace my solid 
lifters with hydraulic lifters while the push rods and tubes are out.  
The case is an 1800 that came out of a '74 411.  I only want to make this 
conversion if the case can still supply enough oil to the rest of the 
engine components.

        TIA.
