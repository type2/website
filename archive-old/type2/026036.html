&gt; where do you find a hitch that doesn't mount to the bumper?  I'd love a
&gt; hitch, but my bumper is only held on by three bolts.

The hitch doesn't mount to the bumper, but does mount WITH the bumper to the
bumper mounting holes on the frame.  If you have only 3 bolts for your
bumper, you would need to get the 4th one fixed.  The way I fix bumper bolts
is to cut a &quot;window&quot; in the side of the frame rail.  I only cut on 3 sides,
then turn the metal out of the way.  Get inside and reweld the nut back to
the frame rail, then pull the window back and weld it.  With a little
grinder work and some spray paint, you can't tell without looking hard that
any repair has been done.

This is the same method VW has used for years on bugs when the clutch cable
tube comes loose inside the tunnel.

As far as the hitch goes, you buy longer bolts, put the bumper in place
first, then the hitch goes under the bumper and the longer bolts secure both
to the frame rails.  This is a very strong set up.  I'm close to 250 pounds
and can stand on the hitch ball, jumping up and down without any movement on
the hitch.  The hitch does not attach to the bumper at all and doesn't touch
the muffler either.  A really clean setup and totally hidden behind the
bumper.
