&gt;What are the approximate dimensions of this panel?

Well, I'd run right out and get those measurements, but a) it's 3:00 A.M.,
and b) the only one I've got is on my bus (which is at work)! :-) But you
could extrapolate measurements from the distances between the attachment
holes in the tin and the clearance of the muffler. Here's a picture (albeit
fuzzy) of the original item for reference:
