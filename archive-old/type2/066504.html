You may have a bit of a problem with those T2 lenses if you run into the
same sort of intensely anal inspector I did.  I bought some SOTB lenses
for my bus at one point and the next time I went for my annual (VA) safety
inspection the inspector flunked the lenses.  All lenses for US use have a
DOT approval cast into them, and that approval must be present.  My
solution was to find a less anal inspector, but I thought y'all might like
to know......
