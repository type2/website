Subject: Looking for 73 transmission mounts

Volks,
Looking for a source for the round upper transmission mounts that hold the
transmission to the brace on the frame.  Not the ones on the nose cone, the
ones on the top that are near where the motor attaches.

My ETKA program lists NLA, and do not see them in any catalogs.  One of mine
is broken, and I need one, even used would be helpful, new preferred.

TIA
