Subject: Re: [T2] Bus oil Low pressure Help

Even on my type one engines I used either 40 or 50 weight valvoline race 
oil.  Dont leave that in for winter though.  I always went synthetic in 
winter because of our erratic climate here.  Same as mentioned in 
another thread check the sender and see if oil is coming out around the 
contact.

&gt; Need some reccomendations on what kind of oil to use in my 70 westfalia

&gt; when I am at idle after driving for a while my oil light comes on and 
&gt; goes away when I push the gas.
&gt; I just rebuilt the engine and am quite frustrated. I am missing some 
&gt; engine seal in the compartment and some tin screws and a piece of tin 
&gt; under the pushrod tube. Would this cause the oil light to come on.
