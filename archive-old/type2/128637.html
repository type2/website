&gt; Ok what is: HVLP????

High Volume, Low Particulate (or low pressure, take your pick). This 
type of sprayer uses very low pressure to prevent &quot;overspray&quot;, that is 
to say excess paint particles that bounce off the surface of your bus 
and into the air. Environmental regs often demand HVLP rigs for 
painting autos.

Problem with the Home Depot unit is that it's likely to be a low power 
turbine unit. Inexpensive, but not up to spraying automotive paint.  If 
you have a compressor you can get a decent HVLP gun inexpensively. You 
have to have a trap to prevent oil from getting into the paint and a 
regulator. It would be worth getting a book on auto paint from your 
FLAPS.
