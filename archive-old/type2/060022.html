Subject: RE: Dual Kadron 40's on a 1600?

I ran dual Kadrons on my stock 1600DP prior to restoring my vehicle. They ran
great right out of the box. They hesitated a little when shifting but I hadn't
adjusted the accellerator pumps at the time. I had a monza exhaust and a 009
dizzy. Pulled MUCH better than my stock setup. Ran cooler, and got better gas
mileage. I now have dual ICT's but my good friend Rob Dahlgren is running them
now on his 69 bus with extractor exhaust and is tickled to death with them. Look
in the archives for some of his recent posts on setup and performance.
