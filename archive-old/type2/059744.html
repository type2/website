Hi everyone
I think I an going to have to sell my project bus.  Me and my wife have
a baby on the way I dont have the time or money to fix her up right.  I
would like to see her go to a good home.  We are located in Denton Texas
(Dallas/Ft. Worth area)   Here are the details:
1964 Sundial camper with Pearl White original paint.  The body is very
solid with very little bad rust and no hidden repairs or damage however
it is dented up and will need some work with a hammer and bondo.  It was
hit around both rear wheel wells and a slight tap in the nose.  The
doors are off right now because the hinges are loose and need to be
welded to sure them up(easy fix)  It has none of the original camper
interior but has some homemade interior panels.  It has a rare sixth
sliding window on the right side in the rear.  I already repainted the
interior in original primer for the rear and pearl white up front (looks
good).  It has brand new 165/15 tires on it and it rolls well.  The
motor needs a valve job and some misc. work and it should run. The
tranny seems good. All the glass is there but some is removed and will
need new rubber to put it back in.  She is fairly complete besides the
interior and is a perfect project bus that wouldnt be that hard to get
running and on the road.  I would like to get what I have in her besides
labor which is around $600 or $500 with out the new tires(I would swap
the tires from my bug they have about 20k left in them).  Any resonable
offer would be fine.  Email me or call me at 1-(940)-891-3733 if you are
interested.
Thanks
