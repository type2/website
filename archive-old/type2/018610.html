I am putting together a 78 2.0 liter and just wanted to know the
interchangeablitly
of the fuel injection parts.  I know I need a new air flow meter and I
have located
one off an 80, will this work?  Also what about having an ECU that was
on a manual
and putting it on an automatic?  I have been playing with the carbs on
my bugs but
have never had fuel injection before, any info would be helpful.
