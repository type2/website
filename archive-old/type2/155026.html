Subject: Great North American Extreme Bus Race + the hubcap

Hey,
While you folks are out there doing your long distance race from Key West to
Alaska keep your eyes open for a lone bus hubcap and a suitcase full of
paraphernalia.  Does any one know what ever became of the hubcap that was
supposed to &quot;tour&quot; North America?
