&gt; Okay most of you have read my GEX situation with the engine. Did somebody 
&gt; say Transmission? How can I tell if my Tranny is stock or different? Is the 
&gt; GEX stamp on the transmission, too? It is an automatic 1977(NOV 1976). Where 
&gt; do I look?

there are only two VW bus auto trannys 
003 from Sept 73- Aug 75
010 from Sept 75- end of production

the number is stamped in the tranny housing right smack in the top center
where it is next to impossible to see without removing it...

you probably have the 010 tranny which is by far the better tranny. one
way to tell which one you have is to remove the clip from the selector
lever on the side of the tranny, if it moves freely it is the 003, if it
is very hard to move and you feel the detents it is probably the 010. also
the 003 has a vacuum can on the side of it the 010 doesn't

I don't think GEX ever touched an auto tranny..in fact part of the problem
is nobody has really rebuilt the auto tranny.  if you can find someone let
me know.  at least the parts are supposedly still avalaible for the 010
tranny
