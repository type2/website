Subject: Re: [T2] Trouble downshifting

shifter bushings would be a good place to start looking.  What year bus or 
vanagon?

Eron

I am having trouble downshifting into second and
&gt;first. The shifter simply won't move. Sometimes I can get into second if I 
&gt;go
&gt;into fourth first. Any ideas?
&gt;Cheers,
&gt;Matthew
