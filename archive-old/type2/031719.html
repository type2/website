&gt; I'm located just south of Mpls., MN.  Is there something I can pick up at a 
&gt; Wal-Mart or a commercial-like place that will have 6-ply?  I've found that's 
&gt; what I need.  I located a guy who can get Yokohams's, but it would take a 
&gt; few days; and like I mentioned earlier, I should get something as quick as I 
&gt; can as I found my spare to be kinda shotty.

I got mine at NTB, but they were Michelins and a bit pricey
BUT excellent tires

I would not be concerned about the 6ply rating but rather the weight
rating,  I don't recall what is required as I am way over it but it is
somewhere around 1490lbs per tire I believe, correct me if I'm wrong here

I know there is mucho information on tires in the library
