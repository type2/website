I know this engine of mine has stumped some of the better minds on this
list with it's refusing to idle.. I had to take it in for the emissions
test today and the results may illuminate those more knowledgable about
this than I 

todays test results were
HC - 5925ppm  - fail
CO -0.00  -  pass
CO2 -14.5%  - pass

the previous test before it was worked on
HC - 1762  - fail
CO -  0.17%  -  pass
CO2 - 14.32 % - pass

FYI the state standard is
HC 430ppm
CO 5.5%
CO2 6.0%

now I know this information tells some of you folks &quot;Something&quot; but I'm
not sure what it tells me except that after all this work it is
essentially worse....  my Hydrocarbons went through the sky, Why????

I assume it is too rich??? 

this is a 78 stock FI 2liter with auto tranny

thanks
Bob
