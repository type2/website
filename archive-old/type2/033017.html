Subject: Electrolytic derusting

&gt;Now I have some questions on this starting with &quot;Has anyone tried this?&quot;,
&gt;but continuing to equivalent cathode/anodes.  The sites I have seen have
&gt;all been concerned with &quot;American Iron&quot; in one form or another (except for
&gt;the Morris Minor page :-) and as such are concerned with removing
&gt;corrosion form iron (rust).  I imagine that removing corrosion from Al and
&gt;Mg would involve the same process, but that you would have to use a
&gt;similar cathode (sacrificial bit)? Check? Any of the physics majors out
&gt;there (think: George :-) want to comment on appropriate anode/cathode
&gt;combinations?  correct my misimpressions on how simple this process is?

I haven't tried it.  But I teach electrochemistry in a coupla courses.

Removing corrosion from Al and/or Mg by electrolysis may (should) not work,
as they are extremely active metals.  In any event, the cathode should be a
fairly inert metal.  Lead or tin (solder) should do nicely.  Platinum would
be best :-).

Essentially the process is electrolysis of water, so O2 is generated at the
cathode, hence the need for an inert electrode.  Hydrogen gas generated at
the rusty electrode is what does at least some of the work.  This is best
done outside, as hydrogen explosions are considered undesirable by most.

The process should be limited only by the size of the tank.  A 55 gal
plastic drum might do a passable job for big pieces.  Worth trying.
