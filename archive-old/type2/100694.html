Subject: More starter problems

&gt;Where exactly is the ground for the starter?  it is
&gt;just grounded to the tranny, which is grounded by the
&gt;wire that goes from the nose of the tranny to the body
&gt;of the bus.

Yes, the tranny ground strap is actually a flat woven copper band.

My bus also has an auxilliary strap from the starter to the battery ground bolt in the engine compartment.

&gt;the only other thing I can think of is
&gt;that the engine isn't moving, but that seems unlikely
&gt;since it was fine when I dropped it and only did some
&gt;clutch work.  I was thinking of pop-starting it and
&gt;see if that breaks the egine loose.  any thoughts of that.

Put the bus in 3rd, roll it backwards. This worked for me once.

Billy
