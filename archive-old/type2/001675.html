Hello Everyone,

The Fuel Guage on my '74 Westy does not work.  It appears to be the sending
unit from the tank.  However, it seems that I would have to remove the
engine and drop the tank to fix this problem, which I am not willing to do.
Solution, I fill up with gas on every even numbered hundered miles.
Problem, my wife drives the bus as well and doesn't follow my suggestion.
So, I get back in the bus and it is out of fuel or worse yet, she is left on
the side of the road calling me to come get her.

Anyway, does anyone have any suggestions for how to safely store / keep a
little gas container with their bus.  I currently have a 1 gallon plastic
can, but I'm not comfortable leaving it in the bus.  Not too sure about the
emergency fuel additives.  I was thinking of putting the entire can of gas
inside a 2 gallon ziploc bag.  How long can fuel sit, and how much heat can
it endure?

Any suggestions would be appreciated.
