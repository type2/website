Does anyone have knowledge of putting a Toyota engine in a loaf? I know
Kennedy Engineering puts out an adapter for a Toyota engine called a &quot;3TC,&quot;
but I don't know what kind of engine that is. I am familiar with the &quot;22R&quot;
used in pickups and wonder if that is a possible swap. On another note, was
there any consensus on the Subaru swap? I read on the Kennedy page that the
most desirable Soob engine, the 2.2 litre, won't fit in a loaf due to a
conflict with the air intake. Older Soob engines will fit, but they are not
horsepower monsters.
