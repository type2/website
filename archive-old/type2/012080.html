Subject: Re: [T2] 2.7 liter rebuild
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Power on a T4 motor that big is AWESOME! However,
you're starting to push the envelope on size, and heat
does become an issue. A friend of mine is running a
2613cc, converted to upright with an OTP shroud in his
daily driven '66 bug, and it's unbelievably powerful.
Neck-snapping torque, and the longest powerband I've
ever felt in a bug. He didn't use the Riechert kit,
but if it's using Mahle pistons/cylinders and other
good quality parts, and is built correctly, it should
be a good, powerful motor that lasts a long time.

&gt; has anyone used one of the 2.7 liter rebuild kits

&gt; http://www.ismi_dot_net/riecherttuning/index.htm I'm
&gt; wondering what this kit
&gt; would do to harm reliablity and what kind of power
&gt; increase it gives.
&gt; cost/benefits
