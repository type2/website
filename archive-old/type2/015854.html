&gt;Same exhaust system the other person was waiting for. (See my last post.)
&gt;Same reason for the delay - RMMW.  

Am I missing something here?  Didn't the person who placed the order
specify that the in-stock parts be sent first, *separately*?  YES, I just
reviewed the post and that is the case!

Therefore someone at Bus Depot screwed up and it has nothing to do with
anything being backordered!  

Instead of blaming it on their suppliers, The Bus Depot should simply say,
&quot;We made a mistake&quot; and make it right with the customer.  Then The Bus
Depot should take steps to make sure that it doesn't happen again, which in
this case points to Ron having a heart-to-heart with his order takers.
Ron, do you have a &quot;special instructions&quot; field in your order taking
software?  If not, I suggest you add it and make sure your order takers
know how to use it.

There are a lot of good things about the Bus Depot, and I have personally
had great results ordering from them, but it is a business and as such it
should acknowledge mistakes like this and deal with them.  We as customers
should not have to accept such mistakes as part of the cost of doing
mail-order business.
