&gt; A little over a week ago I received a long block for my '81 Vanagon
&gt; from GEX.  Just tonight I read through the archives and saw LOTS of
&gt; negative comments about GEX engines, and now I'm VERY nervous.
&gt;
&gt; What can I do during the build up and reinstallation of the engine to
&gt; protect myself if I got a lemon?  I'm doing the work myself, reading
&gt; the Clymer manual carefully, and also reading the Bentley manual.
&gt;
&gt; I've pulled the engine on the van twice, once to redo the clutch,
&gt; once to redo the heads, so I'm fairly confident I know how to remove
&gt; and re-install the engine properly, but what constitutes &quot;proper&quot;
&gt; installation from the standpoint of the GEX warranty?

&gt;From my (absolutely horrible) experience with GEX, should you have a 
problem they are likely to claim that the engine was overheated, and thus 
the warranty is void.  Besides taking the obvious steps to avoid 
overheating the motor (which include proper installation of motor and 
ancilliary items, use of proper oil, etc. - see Bentley and Muir), I would 
carefully document EVERY oil change, etc.  I would also have a local VW 
specialist inspect the installation and put in writing that everything that 
could affect overheating (engine tin, timing, cooling etc.) is within 
factory spec.  The existence of such documentation protected me when GEX 
hassled me about warranting an engine that was clearly defective from day 
one.
