Subject: Re: Be honest... How fast?

&gt;Okay everyone:
&gt;Honestly.
&gt;How fast do you drive your bus?

I drive my '78 as fast as the CHT and oil temp gauges allow me, with an
absolute top of 65 mph.  I never, ever, ever break 65 with the engine in
gear (highest-ever speed down hill with clutch in: 90 mph -indicated-,
confirming that horsepower is not the bus' only speed limitation).
