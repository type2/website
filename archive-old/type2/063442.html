Subject: How's this for an idea?

I just replaced both heater boxes this summer - the old ones broke 
apart.  The good side is that I've got a really tight and quiet 
exhaust system now.  The down side is that I've got a great gas heater 
so I don't use them for heat - nothing like spending money on something 
I'm not really using, right?

Here the concept:  I'm running a single progressive carb and the intake 
manifolds ice up all winter long.  I'm thinking about hooking up some 
sort of flexible tubing to the heater boxes and routing the heat around 
the manifolds.

The tubes could exit through the tin so the hot air isn't dumped into 
the engine compartment.

Any thoughts about what material to use for this?  Am I overlooking 
anything that might harm my engine?
