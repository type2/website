Subject: Knock knock.......Who's There?
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Greetings to the List.........

So I'm out driving my 70 Bus (less than 70,000 miles on the clock).  Just 
toodling along.  Not going more than 10 or 15 mph on a curvy little road 
through some beautiful parkland.  As I negotiate right hand turns at this 
speed I OCCASIONALLY hear a clear knock-knock-knock coming from what seems to 
be the left rear of the Bus.  Once I hear this same sound (same speed) on a 
straightaway.
In general daily use I hear nothing like this at all.  Freeway speeds, 
surface streets, turning, backing - nothing.  Since this little incident I 
have heard nothing from the Bus.  But, then again, I have not driven it in 
the same manner.
Which brings me about to the dreaded question......is this knock-knock-knock 
the likely telltale sign of a CV joint going out?  Everything looks solid 
underneath.  Boots are looking good - no tears.  Or could it signify 
something else entirely?  Or, for that matter, is this sort of thing to be 
expected at this uncommon speed?

Mike
