Well it's Friday seem like a good time to post this.........
after reading the posts for the last several months, I've noticed there seems to be a thread 
developing over the issue of parts..whether new, used, reconditioned or what have you.
I don't know if anyone else has noticed or not. Is there a parts scarcity for our beloved buses, or
can we go on driving them well into the next millennium?

There are alot of newcomers to this list, that are contemplating purchasing a bus, westy
kombi, call it what you will. Not all will buy that minty 78 Westy that has been garaged for the
last 10 years, 50 k on the dial, not a speck of rust....we can dream...

They hear of the trials and tribulations of list members trying to fix up their buses..unable to find the right part they need.....only to find that VW hasn't made that part for the last 15 yrs.
Only way to get the part they need is to scrounge the salvage yards or possibly buy an after-
market part or reproduction item.

Then someone will cross the big pond, visit the elves in the Black Forest, return with a motherlode
of &quot;original VW parts&quot;, that haven't seen the light of day for years. With the usual comment of,
&quot;lookie here, found these parts that haven;t been available for last decade on North American soil'&quot;
and  &quot; when they're gone, thats it forever&quot;  and then a year later...guess what...wonder of wonders
the elves in the Black Forest have come thru again...more parts???(the same ones that we would never see again..ever)

Now..don't get me wrong....I'm not trying to slam retail/wholesale sellers of bus parts..whether
new used or reconditioned....that's not the point of this sermon...

Will the parts supply ever really end..??  I can't help but feel that alot of the newcomers to this
list and indeed to the VW scene in general..are going to be discouraged about the parts scarcity
that seems to be eminating from the list..the last few months...

I for one would hope and like to think we will be able to keep our buses running indefinitely.

So...parts scare...myth or reality??
