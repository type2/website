Not on a 75 with an auto tranny.  Engine comes right out.  i went to the

BTW - if i followed the Bentley word for word i'd never get anything done...

in Morehead, Ky. realizing that the 'big wrench' between my ears is the most
important tool i've got - this list being the second - Bentley being third.
