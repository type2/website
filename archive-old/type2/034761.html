Subject: Ultra-clean cat./exhaust refit (76-78)

If you need to fit or replace a catalytic converter in a 1976-1978 
exhaust system, and you want to do it at a reasonable price, and you want 
to avoid the bodge jobs that muffler shops do to these systems, here's how:

1. Get a junkyard muffler out of a Vanagon wasserboxer. If genuine VW 
(and your chances are pretty good) this is a solid, sturdy muffler (much 
heavier that the aircooled mufflers) with a flange installed on each end.

2. Get a &quot;univeral&quot; cat from Pep Boys ($69.00).

3. Get two three-hole triangle flanges (Pep Boys may have them; I got 
mine from Napa. Take an old flange gasket to check the size.

The easiest but cleanest way to make the installation is as follows:

1. Disconnect the whole exhaust system from the heat exchangers forward. 
You end up with the cross-over tube, the j-shaped thingy, the old cat (or 
pipe), muffler, and tailpipe.

2. Disconnect the old muffler and hang the wasserboxer muffler in its 
place. There is a flanged weld the length of the late mufflers; you will 
have to hammer it down to fit, but that's no problem at all. Adjust the 
muffler so that the spacing for placing the cat is about right, and the 
flanges are lined up in one plane.

3. Now measure the offset between the exit flange on the j-shaped thingy 
and the muffler. You are going to cut the universal cat so that it makes 
this offset. You also want to get the angles to the flanges correct on 
either side.

4. To make your cuts, clamp the cat in a vertical position, taking care 
that the air indicating the flow is going the right way. Pencil the angle 
of the cut on the table under the vice, and set up a square to show the 
vertical. Grab a hacksaw and cut each end, being careful to line the saw 
up with the pencil marks and the square.

5. Loosely bolt the new flanges to the j-thingy and the muffler, then 
check the fit of your newly-cut cat. If it's not perfect, get out the 
grinder or a file and clean it up.

6. Put the cat back in place and mark the positions where the flanges 
will join the pipes.

7. If you have a welder, weld. If not, take the cut and marked cat and 
the flanges to a muffler shop and have them weld it up. It'll cost about 
$20. 

8. Bolt everything up and attach to the heater exchangers.

9. Make adjustments in the tailpipe as needed.


This isn't speculation; I did it and it works, it's clean, and the 
muffler-welder guy gave me high marks for my angle cuts, which made be 
feel real competent.
