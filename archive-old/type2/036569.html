 This is something anyone who drives any car with a std should do.  I bought
my 83 t_at_yota tercel (4wd wagon - neat car) from my dad with 125k on the
original clutch. He said &quot;That clutch is adjusted all the way out -its gonna
be clutch time soon...&quot;

I always run in nuetral if im coasting or sitting at a light - clutch
disengaged with foot off the pedal.
50,000 hard miles later and it will still 'bark' first gear if i'm rough on it
- which i'm not - usually. Can't resist exploring a logging road every once in
a while. ;-D
