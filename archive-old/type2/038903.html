&gt; Hello all,
&gt;
&gt; im bran new to the list!  My girlfriend and I have been planning a cross
&gt; country trip for a couple of months now and are planning to leave in
&gt; June.  We will be doing alot of camping and backpacking so we wanted to
&gt; get some insight or suggestions as to the essential things we would need
&gt; to take with us.  Not only for the bus but for ourselves as well.  We
&gt; plan to travel for awhile and have become overwhelmed with the things we
&gt; are taking with us.  We also have our two dogs, so suggestions for them
&gt; would also be appreciated.  Again any advice from anyone who has done
&gt; this or traveled for awhile would be fantastic! Thanks for the help and
&gt; the insight
