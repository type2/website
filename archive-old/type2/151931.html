&gt; 2002 with my two bros. My fave place in the whole
&gt; world. what in the world would Death Valley have over
&gt; the Grand Canyon? To each there own, I guess.

I hate mobs, and the Grand Canyon is a tourist trap, I did the North rim
and the East rim (yes there is an East rim).  the North Rim was a mob
scene a week before the rim was closed for the winter, can't imagine what
it would be like in the summer...the East rim was nice, 3 cars in the lot
and I didn't even see em...much better.

now Death Valley, except for the visitor center I didn't see but one other
person in 8 hours. now that is my idea of seeing the sights and not the
other sightseers
