Subject: Re: [T2] New trick for replacing bottom generator brush

Haha, good point George! I hope this one isn't a &quot;hungry&quot; generator, I hate
standing on my head. The tape on the screwdriver trick sounds good though!!!
Never thought of that, I was just dreading ever having to get that little
screw back in if I completely removed it. :-)
Take care,
Courtney

&gt; It helps to have a generator that is eating brushes regularly to get you
&gt; into practice!  :)
