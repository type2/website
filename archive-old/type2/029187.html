I saw an interesting few posts on the Eurovan list about this same subject,
several owners of eurovan campers have mounted low-profile window A/C units
in their luggage rack and made a fabric boot to feed the cool air output
through the window in their tent. They also had insulated their tent with
the Reflectix foil covered bubblewrap insulation externally or vw
insulation curtains on the inside. One resident of texas was very happy
with her complete A/C and Reflectix wrapped camper, said it made a huge
difference when camping.
