Subject: Re: [T2] Transvair for Sale

Engine size? EM engine or LM engine?

Gearbox ratios?

Price?

Thanks.


&gt;Looks like I am going to be selling my Transvair kit.  If anybody is
&gt;interested let me know.  Engine is overall good, excellent OP, could use
&gt;minor head work, some valve difficulty, not sure what kind yet, but not
&gt;severe runs great (not apart yet) transmission is good, differential good
&gt;but needs a seal or bushing I think, clutch is bad due to oil impregnation I
&gt;think.  ( do not have it all apart yet so I am not clear yet on the
&gt;specifics.)  Runs good oil pressure. Engine rebuilt 99 by a Corvair place in
&gt;FL. Two rebuilt carbs from Clarks just installed.  One guy Emailed with
&gt;interest but I lost his Email.  I have already got a newly overhauled engine
&gt;so the decision was made for me to go back to VW but I would be interested
&gt;in trading for somebody's runout VW guts since I don't yet have a tranny or
&gt;the miscellaneous parts.  A good chance to do the conversion since it is all
&gt;here that you'd need.  Glen Ward Bridgeport WV
