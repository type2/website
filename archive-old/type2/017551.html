Hello Keri,

I have some louvered windows.  They are aftermarket (gee, I think) from
a '72 VW camper we purchased real cheap for parts.  I have not checked
them, but they should still work...  This is the type window that
extends out from the hole in the door they are installed in.  If you are
interested in them (it?--don't know if there are one or two of them)
e-mail me and I'll have the hubby-type-person check them out to see if
they still work, and to make sure they are what you are looking for.

Also, I have other camper guts out of that '72 (stove, sink, back
cabinet... seat...) if anyone is interested.  The body is pretty
straight and in good shape too.
