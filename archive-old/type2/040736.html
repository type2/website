Subject: RE: Trolley Jack

Well Howard, the handle on my jack is about 4' long and even that only just
pokes out behind the bumper when I'm lifting the rear of the bus.  You
really need to get the biggest jack you can afford, buses are heavy.  Also,
because of the ground clearance, you need quite a high lift.  My handle
separates into 2 halves and the end is very useful as a cheater bar.
If you compare different jacks, you will see that they basically fall into 2
categories - cheap and wimpy or twice as much and chunky.  Get the chunky
kind.

&gt; I'm looking to buy a trolley jack, and I most such things are rated at
&gt; 2-tons, others are available at extra cosst (2.5 ton or 3.0 
&gt; tons).   I'm
&gt; thinking that any of these would do (although, undoubtably 
&gt; I'll get what I
&gt; pay for too...)
&gt; 
&gt; But the *real* purpose of my question is about the length of 
&gt; the lifting
&gt; arm.  Some of these seem really quite short - about 18 inches 
&gt; (~ 0.5 metres)
&gt; Is this sufficient for must purposes on a stock height bus ?
