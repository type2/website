Subject: Clunk in Vacuum Brake Servo? ('76)
Message-ID: &lt;19990507143709.18982.rocketmail_at_web103.yahoomail_dot_com&gt;

Hello list, 

I've been slowly working on my brakes, replacing front rotors &amp; pads,
all rubber hoses &amp; rear pads &amp; cylinders.  Barry Burneskis gave me the
vacuum assist brake servo and master cylinder from the '77 he is
dismantling.  After about 20 miles, I started hearing a clunk coming
&gt;from the brake servo everytime I hit a bump.  If I depress the brake
pedal about an inch (taking up the slack) I hear no bump.  It seems
that the servo is not returning all the way to its &quot;out&quot; position when
I take my foot of the brakes, and that creates slack between the rod
&gt;from the brake pedal and the face of the brake servo plate.  I've
fiddled with the brake servo that I removed, and I can see that these
things are slow to return to the &quot;out&quot; position without vacuum assist. 
Could it be that I have a vacuum leak on the return circuit?  Or could
it be that this unit just needs some lubricant inside to make it return
easier?  Any other thoughts? 

If I can't get this unit to work, I will switch back to the old servo,
but this probably entails opening the brake lines again, and bleading
the system, a process I am now all too familiar with. 

Also, lessons learned from bleading brakes:  After replacing the front
hoses, be sure to bleed both valves on the front calipers.  I had
enough air in the top valve area that I could get no pressure at all.
