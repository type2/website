Subject: 15 in. wheels

Anybody have any experience with converting to 15 inch wheels on a breadloaf? 
An on-
line wheel source indicated Mercedes Benz wheel code et37 6.5 x 15 h2 , but 
didn't
reveal what model(s) or years. Any other wheels (available from the local 
recycler, 
please), with the correct offset and bolt pattern. Some machining can be done 
(en-
larging the center hole). I'm not looking for custom alloys, just a set of 
stock wheels
to utilize 15 inch tires.
Thanks in advance.
