Subject: Re: Battery Light On!

&gt;was planning on going to the mountains next weekend. i understand that the
&gt;cooling is not affected by the alternator operation in a type iv. is it still
&gt;safe to drive? if the battery is drained i could push start it right?

Sure. True: Once I drove to El Paso and back with no battery. It helps to
have a girlfriend who is not easily perturbed and doesn't mind pushing, but
the point is: REAL MEN DON'T USE ELECTRICITY! ;) ;)
