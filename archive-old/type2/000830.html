Everything you always wanted to know about tires and rims but were afraid to
ask !!

While all you Americans were still sound asleep I created a web-page on
tires and rims for our beloved buses. Have a look at
http://www.hrps_dot_demon.nl/jwbus/T2-tires.htm

Feedback is appreciated!

Since this information also applies to Vanagons can someone please crosspost
it there (I'm not on their list anymore).
