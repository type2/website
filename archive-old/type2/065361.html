&gt;Absolutely none of the repro-parts sellers have any of the OEM-style
&gt;exhaust pieces, and VWoA just laughs at you.  Your only, only, ONLY
&gt;option is to use the repro stuff sold as &quot;fits 72-74, 79-83&quot;.  But as
&gt;mentioned, these systems don't accept catalytic converters.  If you're
&gt;in a state that checks for it, you're hosed (my friend was).
&gt;
&gt;And heater boxes, as Ron Salmon pointed out, are a one-year-only item.
&gt;In fact, the way Bentley reads, they weren't even produced for a whole
&gt;model year, but maybe only 9 months.  I can't imagine retooling a whole
&gt;production line for that!  VWAG must have been asleep at the wheel, is
&gt;all I can figure.  You know they were already retooling for the Vanagons
&gt;in 79, in fact, I think some 79 model-year Vanagons were actually sold
&gt;in Europe.  The only sensible thing to do would have been to use the
&gt;same parts on the 79 US bus, but no, they didn't do that.

Maybe I'm missing something, but besides your only, only, etc. option,
couldn't you also use heads from an earlier year?  They might have to be
cut to accept 2.0L jugs if they were for a different bore, and granted
type IV heads aren't exactly cheap, but I just wanted to point out another
solution.  Sorry if there's some obvious problem with this that I'm
overlooking.
