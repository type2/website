X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL - S
 and buying a  VW bus - LONG!

Hi All,

Steve's comment about 1 year in VW hell is well
phrased.  I used to call my 80 Westy the van from
hell.  The first thing I noticed after I bought it was
gasoline on the driveway after a fill up.  Many of my
hours later, I discovered a cracked fuel sender unit
mounting plate that allowed gasoline to pool on the
top of the tank after a fill up.  I quickly introduced
myself to the intricacies of the vanagon gas tank with
its many vent pipes, hoses, and grommets, and its
dastardly crossover pipe that keeps you from lowering
it without breaking something.

I spent the next year or two learning about my Westy,
and I conservatively estimate my maintenance labor so
far at $4352.  Herein lies the true secret of VW bus
ownership.  Not many are willing to spend their time
learning to do their own maintenance, and paying a
mechanic to do it gets ridiculous real fast.  By the
way, the $4352 doesn't even include the price of an
engine rebuild, which I am still trying to get done to
perfection (I'd like good hot idle oil pressure -
anyone have a great crank and rod set?).

The mechanic who rebuilt the bottom end of Bob's
engine said it best when he described my efforts to
get a great engine rebuild &quot;Good luck on your quest&quot;. 
Maintenance on a VW bus is more like a quest or a
process that may never get completed.  More accurately
(in true Zen like fashion?) an owners bus maintenance
gets completed to his/her own evolving standards.
