OK,

Compression ratios are a tricky thing.....I have my opinions, just like
everyone. I can say that I HAVE HAD, AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE good luck
with Higher Compression ratios. A bus is a very different matter than most
applications, as it gets super hot under up hill loads.

I try to share as much info as possible about my experiences with CR as I
possibly can, without letting the total cat out of the bag, and giving every
thing I have learned up for the internet world to &quot;Cut&quot; and &quot;Paste&quot; into
their own armory of knowledge. I'm more than willing to help, knowledge does
not come easy. I will never write a &quot;Blue Book&quot; that will tell everyone how
and why to do everything, and that it is the only way, and that every
product I do not sell is basically inferior.

Using Higher CR also requires some camshaft changes, even with a stock
cam( lobe centers).Ignition timing must be set differently, and you must use
good gas all the time..I have built several low CR engines, and most of them
were a pain to tune, and they actually created as much heat from
inefficiency as the engines with more CR did, especially when being worked
hard.

I'm not saying that every bus on the road should go above 8:1, or that a
1776 can live on 10:1, merely that stock, or more CR can be run without
problems..if everything else in the engine meets the criteria for the CR
change.

I know, this is undoubtedly going to cause some sense of &quot;flame&quot; as my view
is on the verge on defying conventional wisdom, it is what I have found, and
what I believe in.......My experiences with both low and high CR have led me
to a happy medium, of around 7.7:1 on virtually everything..And yes, several
stock 1600 engines had a 7.7:1 rating, from the factory.

With our engine failure rate of 3% it cannot harm very much..

&gt; &gt; Would we have a lot of trouble with gas at low altitudes with the higher
&gt; &gt;  CR? I know the magic number used to be 9:1 or was it 9.5:1. But all the
&gt; &gt;  changes in gas over the years, I don't know what a safe CR is anymore.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Before anybody goes and builds an engine with 8:1 compression they should
&gt; read what Gene Berg has to say about compression ratios.  You can call
&gt; 714-998-7500 to get a catalog and the info is in there.
&gt; I contacted Jake (the guy who originally suggested 8:1 CR's) off line and
&gt; asked a few specific questions about his recommendation.  I didn't expect
him
&gt; to spend lots of time replying and I deleted the post so I can't quote
him.
&gt; However, I did get some impressions that I think are worthwhile to pass on
to
&gt; the list.
&gt; I asked him what kind of engine life to expect with 8:1 compression.
&gt; Specifically I asked if he's gotten 100,000 miles or more on such an
engine.
&gt; He didn't answer that question.
&gt; What he did say was that after much trial and error he has a formula
where,
&gt; by adjusting valve sizes and cam grinds he's able to make 8:1 work.  He
&gt; wasn't willing to share any of that info, however.
&gt; Anyway, I think that there is a whole lot more to this than just raising
the
&gt; compression ratio and driving your bus as usual.  I'd hate to see somebody
do
&gt; this and go out and burn a hole in a piston because of running a CR that
is
&gt; too high.
