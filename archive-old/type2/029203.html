Hey Andy,

I put mine on the rear of the driver-side rear wheel well.  Inside the
engine compartment, that is.  Out of the way when you drop the engine, good
air flow.

I ended up splicing my pertronix, choke and cutoff and am not real excited
about it either.  I'd be interested in seeing/hearing about your solution.

I was thinking about putting the backup lights back on the coil, does
anyone know if that will have an adverse effect on the CDI?

Best of luck on a good investment.

I know what to do electrically but does anyone have a suggestion for a
nice clean unobtrusive location?
Also what have you done with the 12v which now needs to go to
tiger,pertronix+,cutoff,choke and brakelites. Im thinking terminal block
because splicing 5 wires just doesnt sound that appealing to me.
Pictures would be excellent as well.

BTW I got it from John at aircooled_dot_net and with the cheapest shipping
(usps which BTW got here in 3 days) and his generous 10% discount the
total was only ~87.00. Such a deal
