German Auto Engineer Issued Lab Coat

DUSSELDORF, GERMANY

Karl Meine, a new engineer at BMW, was issued a white lab coat Monday, giving him the air of a man at the forefront of German automotive technology. &quot;Karl will wear his lab coat and observe BMW prototypes being driven at extreme speeds on sheets of gleaming ball bearings,&quot; said BMW chief engineer Gunnar Hoechst. &quot;He will also stand before a wall of computers as cars are subjected to advanced 59-point wind-tunnel tests in stark, white rooms.&quot; In addition to the lab coat, Meine has been issued a clipboard.
