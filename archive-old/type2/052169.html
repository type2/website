Subject: [T2] 78 Champagne Ed. For Sale

Hey Volks,

It's hard to do, but I'm putting my '78 Champagne Edition up for sale. I 
also want to thank everyone who's offered advice for the few posts I've sent 
over the last few years.

If you go by Shelby's poll, it's in daily driver condition.

Here are the vitals:

*My dad and I are the original owners
*It has 187,380 miles (still on first engine, put in new transmission at 
120k)
*runs fairly well (needs some airflow work)
*new tires and shocks
*very clean interior w/good carpeting and seats in great cond.
*some small patches of rust on body

What needs work to keep it a daily driver:

*rear break adjusters frozen
*windshield wiper hose leaks under steering wheel
*needs new airflow meter

Here are a couple of extras:

*We've kept gas station fill-up records since day-one, plus some recent 
maintenance records
*roof rack rails
*2 studded tires on matching wheels(silver, not champagne rust-color)
*original tire changing equipment, tire iron, spare tire is mounted on 
front.
*tire chains
*original owners manual, warranty manual and the VW repair/maintenance 
book(sorry for the grease-stained pages)

I'm selling for $2450/obo

Thanks,

Arvid Hokanson
Seattle, WA
