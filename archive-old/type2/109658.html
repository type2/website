&gt;Bentley is not helpful on this. It
&gt; says to put the right bearing halves on the crank and cam and then
&gt; install the left side of the case.  I am not confident that the tangs on
&gt; the bearings will line up and seat properly if I do that.  I've always
&gt; put the right bearing halves in the right case and then lowered it down
&gt; to the left. 

Greg- Get another Bentley:)
Fit the bearings in the case. 
If they fall out when you shake it, get another case:)
Use the plastic vibration dampers.
