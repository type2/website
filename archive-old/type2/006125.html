Subject: upright engine in a 79 bus adaptor - question

I have the adapter from JC Whitney.  Does the plate replace the oil pump
cover or does it go on top of the oil pump cover?

Also, my engine hangs off my transmission that hangs off a bracket that sits
in a frame member.  There are rubber mounts that it sits on and one of them
is torn up (makes my engine hang with a tilt).  Where could I find a new
rubber mount or of what size is it (I can't tell with the engine in)?  Has
anyone played with these rubber mounts within memory?

Christopher
