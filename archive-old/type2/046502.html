Subject: [T2] front top fiberglass piece 

I currently have a 73 Sportsmobile,  it has the &quot;penthouse&quot; camper on 
it,however there is no front fiberglass piece  that sits on top of the bus 
in the front,I want to put this small front fiberglass piece on my bus. I 
spied one at the local  junkyard on a 72-79 westy, my question is how do I 
get it off the bus that it is on now? do I just tear the headliner, and I 
will see the bolts that hold it down?
anybody ever done this?

thanks
mike
