[...] George, list

I've never heard of that either, connecting an ammeter to the earth. Reasoning it
through, ideal resistance of earth strap = 0, resistance of ammeter = 0, so ammeter
could read from 0-full current flow!!!!! In my experience, my voltmeter's connections
have been 2-3 times less reliable than the actual battery/split charge connections,
so it would be a useful indicator of ammeter reliability!!!! (Full = ammeter good, 0 =
ammeter wiring faulty!)

I already have 7 additional gauges, so I think I'll live without an 8th/9th. In fact, I
could do with a gauge telling me if I'm gonna drive into another car, the time I spend
looking at the darn things.

Which brings me onto an interesing side topic....unlike fixed wing pilots, who use their
instruments a lot, helicopter pilots gain much more information from out-of-cockpit sight.
So, how about a single light (say green), that flashes when all is okay (like temp,
pressure, revs, fuel all within a specified range). It could be located on the dash and
also at each side. It flashes, you know all is well. It stops flashing and you start to
check the gauges for out-of-ideal conditions. Just a pipe-dream.......

I admire the top fuel dragster drivers who have a single gauge (fuel pressure) in front
of them.
