Volks -

My wife bought me this groovy &quot;Hawaii shirt&quot; at Target, on clearance sale.
It has pictures of a Woody, a convertible, and a 1971 DC, all by the beach
under palm trees. The pattern's mostly blue and green, with splashes of
yeller 'n brown, just in case you'd be inclined to go look for one at your
local store.

Also, Target's been selling green VW Bus boxer shorts for some time, of
which I have two pair. I also know Nikki owns at least one pair, 'cuz she
modeled it for us at Busses By Cabrillo Beach 8^/

Target is a good store.
