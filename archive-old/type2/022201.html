&gt;GEX - does not seem to have my motor that i know only as a 1600 dual port -

&gt;AVP - i haven't heard anything &quot;to beware&quot; of them as i have with gex.
however, they also do not appear to have a 1600 dual port... and there's
that &quot;rear mount again. should i be sticking to my bus year?

&gt;VWPARTS - still don't know if the're talking about dual port, should i
&gt;abandon that altogether?
