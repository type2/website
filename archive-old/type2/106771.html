If it was the original, it should work &quot;ok&quot;...make sure the fins a
straight and *clean*.  Fin combs at the hardware store(I think).

Make sure the fans work well and the a/c(even in a bus) should be ok.

Used to work for VPC where we made them....I think my condensors in
mine(78) are larger than 3x3 though.  I really haven't looked yet.

My buddy that was the engineer on the VW bus a/c projects was just up
a couple of weeks ago and said he would get me a sanden compressor from
his supplier as a &quot;sample&quot;.&lt;thank god for college buddies!&gt;


I need a college buddy too!  Actually, a few years back, I bought a 
brand-spankin' new Sanden 508(?) compressor for the '70.  The only issue I 
have is the angle of the inlet and outlet on my compressor.  I think I will 
need them with right-angles, and they are straight.  Do you have multiple 
condensers?  I only have the one.  I have combed the fins, and cleaned them 
thoroughly.  The louvered stone-guard is still intact as well.  It sported 
dual, aluminum-bladed fans with motors the size of a type2 wiper motor.  I 
plan on replacing these with small (8 or 10&quot;) slimline fans from Hayden or 
another reputable manufacturer of automotive fan.  I hope the expansion 
valve doesn't need replacement.  It is a pain to drop that thing by 
yourself...
