Hi George,

   I think that most radios have an internal AM antenna while the external
connection is for the FM band. I havent messed about with car radios much
for awhile but I know you used to be able to pull antenna cable off the back
connector of the radio and still get AM signal. The AM antenna is a wire
wrapped ferrite(?)  bar,,,,so you have two different antenna systems.
   
The through-the-glass antennas work fine for VHF frequencies and
above, which means that FM reception will be good but AM will not.

Another alternative is to run a wire out of the engine air intake, as
I do for my amateur radio antennas.  Works well with a roof rack and
the only hole you have to punch is hidden behind the spare tire.  This
works well for ham and CB antennas as the hole can be made big enough
to pass coax with PL-259 connectors attached.

I have seen this done for radios and T.V. antennas. Though I would mount
a &quot;L&quot; bracket inside the air channel with a BNC or PL bulkhead connector.
that way you can unplug the antenna when driving if you want to, leaving the
bulk of the cable length permanently installed.

Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me;
Other times I can barely see.
Lately it occurs to me. What a long strange trip it's been!
