Gentlepersons-
                      Does anyone remember the &quot;exact&quot; title or ISBN # of the 
camper con-
version book for Kyle? That info and &lt;www.addall_dot_com&gt; could turn up an out of 
print
copy for him...I'm still looking for a cheap copy of &quot;How To Restore Wooden 
Body Fram-
ing&quot; by Alan Alderwick, though...
