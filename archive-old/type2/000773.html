&gt;  I have an idea: drill two small holes, one at the top of
&gt; the upright, one down at the bottom.

If memory serves me right there should already be drain-holes, if not, it's
a very good idea to drill them and carry out the proposed procedure. I have
read this suggestion in other plcases as well.
