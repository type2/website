I replaced both the filler neck elbow and the section of hose at the tank in
my '78 without removing the engine.
However, I did remove the fire wall as well. I don't have the FI any more,
so removing my Weber progressive takes about 5 minutes. The bottom 2 screws
in my fire wall are gone, so all I have to do is remove the remaining screws
and by bending the top part of my engine tin out, I can squeeze the fire
wall out ( I don't plan on doing this a lot as this will surely weaken my
tin). After 20 years the rubber hose and the filler elbow are pretty well
attached to the metal filler neck even if you loosen the clamps. I can't
imagine doing this job just through the small round access hole. Is your
metal filler neck bad and not the rubber? I have an extra metal neck. As far
as I know the rubber hose at the tank is unavailable. It has a very slight
bend. I used a straight section of gas rated hose I got from NAPA. Once
again the lack of bend causes a little problem in getting everything in
squarely. I lubed up the hose w/ grease where it attached to the neck and
tank so I could wiggle and position everything, then cranked the clamps down
tight. After a year of loosing gallons of gas I haven't lost a drop of gas
since and its a real joy to say &quot;fill'r up!&quot; at the gas station. Good Luck.

&gt; Some of what I read lead me to believe that perhaps it's not necessary
&gt; to drop the engine to get the access cover to the gas tank off.  True?
&gt; Should I go to this trouble and replace more lines/check things out
&gt; while I'm in there?
