From wilden1:
&gt; I've seen Fabreez advertized, it supposed to remove odors.
&gt; Personally I think I'd take the seats out and scrub them down real good
&gt; with soap and water, mabey carpet shampoo.
&gt; I'd let them dry in the sun for a few days, if you currently are having
&gt; sunny days.
&gt; I recovered a pair of really nasty front seats and I sprayed them down
&gt; with Ez-off oven cleaner to remove the caked on human sweat and oils. It
&gt; took two applications and a fair amount of brushing but they came out
&gt; real nice.

I bought a Westy driveaway tent that had a bad mildew odor to it. I let it
air out in the sun for 2 weeks.....didn't help. I sprayed it with a weak
solution of bleach and water.....didn't help. Got a spray bottle of Febrez
[correct spelling, I still have it] and sprayed it..... smell went away for
good! The stuff works.
