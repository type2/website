I don't want to slam anybody but when dealing with *-Bay sellers be sure
that you fall into the insured $200.00 limit and require Escrow on other
higher amounts.

I or We just shut down a scammer that took in about 10K from *-Bay
victoms.

He just got me for $78.00 but a buch of folks got burned for over a
grand.

I'll be able to get my money back sometime in the year 2005 because less
than $200.00 is insured by *-Bay.

 That's what the man says.  I'm not on vintage but for any of you
 cross listers, that has to be a deal.  He claims NOS, 2 heads,
 bare.  He has a &quot;buy it now&quot; of $200.  Somebody has got to need
 these at that price.  Do a search for VW heads and they'll be
 there.
