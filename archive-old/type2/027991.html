Strongly suggest against B. The engine I'm finishing the rebuild on now had 3 sockets and 2 sparkplugs under the tinware. They each found resting spots on the head and proceeded to melt away part of the head. I presume the melting impeeded cooling and impacted performance slightly.

I'm sure there's a magnet out there strong enough to help. And as soon as I find one, I'll buy 2. One for me...and one for the next guy who posts a problem like this.

Take care! Joe

&gt;&gt;        Hypothetically speaking, ... the plug and the socket it is in fall of your wrench
&gt;&gt;and go deep inside the engine tin. 
...
&gt;&gt; b) pretend it didn't happen, get a new plug and a new socket and try
&gt;&gt;again.   Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
