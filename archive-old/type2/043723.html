&gt; The 71 I just acquired had a bunch of tape around the carburetor (Solex 34 
&gt; pict 3). Naturally, I took the tape off to see why it was there. Bingo, this 
&gt; round piece about the size of a dime came falling off the carburetor! I don't 
&gt; think this piece has a name,

Sure it does.  It's called &quot;The round piece on the back of the carb!&quot;

&gt; but if you look at the carb from the rear of the 
&gt; bus, it is right in the center above the bolt that attaches the carb to the 
&gt; manifold. It looks like it is not supposed to be removeable. So, is there any 
&gt; safe way to reattach this, or do I need a new carb? Also, if I need a new 
&gt; one, would I be better off w/a reconditioned Solex than a Bocar? Thanks all.

It can be safely reattached.  Just clean it and the opening really well 
(use spray carb cleaner), pop it back into its hole and peen it
into place.  You'll probably see where it was peened previously.

Finally, get some fuel-proof epoxy (JB Weld is one brand) and run a bead
of it around the edge of the round piece.  It helps to have the carb off
of the engine and positioned with the round piece facing upward.
