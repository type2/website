Subject: [T2] thermostat ?

&gt; how does the thermostat cable connect to the thermostat itself?

The cable has a small barrel on one end.  The thermostat is threaded (male)
on one end.  There's a nut (female) that has one side of the nut closed off
except for a small hole through the middle.  Thread the non-barrel end of
the cable into the nut and pull the cable until the barrel stops the cable
from going any farther.  Thread the nut on the thermostat.

&gt; I finally figured out what was causing my bus to run so hot. the
thermostat
&gt; cable is GONE.

Should have anything to do with running hot.  If the thermostat fails or the
cable is cut the flaps a spring-loaded to move into the &quot;hot engine&quot; (i.e.,
full cooling) position.
