Subject: Hatch Bikes Racks Now Available

This is really great news.  Fiamma is once again making the hatch rack for 
the VW Bus.

I will be getting a shipment in hopefully by the beginning of September.

http://eurocampers_dot_com/Fiammaracks.html

I am going to start taking orders now since there are limited number 
available, and I don't yet know when I will get more.  You can reserve a rack 
with a credit card number.  I really don't want to take any checks or money 
orders since I won't be able to ship the rack for at least a month.  Your 
credit card will not be charged until the rack ships to you.

The Fiamma T1 rack is listed as fitting '68 - '79, but I suspect it will fit 
some earlier models as well.  The rack will firmly hold 2 bikes and requires 
no drilling or other modifications.  The rack clamps to your rear hatch and 
allows easy access to your engine compartment.

p-mail for more information.

Thanks

Steve Lashley
