ouch, about 100,000 at least too soon
&gt; 
&gt; Before going the rebuild route again, I want to see what my options are,
&gt; i.e., is it possible to buy a new long block (hecho en Mexico?) in the US
&gt; and install, or what.

yes you can buy a rebuilt long block, but not a new one, stay away from
the &quot;Crate&quot; rebuilders ESPECIALLY GEX. 

&gt; 
&gt; Given that I live in Hillsboro (Portland) Oregon, I have a bias in favor of
&gt; Northwest suppliers.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone have any good ideas as to where I can get a new long block or good
&gt; reliable rebuild.

find a machinist that will let you work with him/her and get your hands
dirty, take the time and follow the specs, expect to spend about 1500-2000
on a high quality stock rebuild.

good luck
Bob
