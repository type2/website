My mother arrived for a vacation here in Germany yesterday.  Unfortunately on 
the way home from the airport they were involved in an accident and I lost my 
beloved mother.  I will thus be out of the picture for quite some time with 
arrangements for return of her and the memorial.  Thus all waiting for 
pictures and answers on either a business level and personal must now endure 
the wait.  I will answer personal mail upon my return as well as photograph 
the 66 split at a later date.  Live life to the fullest for we know not when 
or what the end shall bring..
Peace Out
Rick
