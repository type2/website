Hey Alex, I have a 78 Champagne Edition, 7 pass bus with A/C. You are right 
about the head room, no matter what I do it seems that A/C unit likes my 
head, and I'm only average height. Both my children hit it evertime they get 
into the front seat and when the get into the middle seat in the back. mine 
is not hooked up, currently the compressor is located in the fender well, the 
system still has pressure on it. I was told it worked prior to engine 
removal. I got the bus with the engine in many parts. the pully was missing 
which I found out later it also doubled as the fan spacer, the mounting 
bracket for the compressor is also missing. I have not been able to find it. 
Do you are can you get a picture of what it looks like so i know what it 
looks like. Maybe one day I will get lucky and find it? as far as power goes, 
the 1600 is a dog with A/C you are better off pushing it with A/C. Now my 
with my 2L I have trouble keeping it under 80 on the highway and getting up 
there is just as easy. But then again I'm not on the drag strip. I live in 
Florida were it get real hot and the only hills we have here we call bridges. 
So if i want to go fast i drive my 71 Superbeetle. My over head unit is 
starting to fall apart, dryrot and craking it is very brittle. Any ideal were 
to get another one? I want A/C and I have most of what I need now.
