Subject: RE: [T2] PaintFest

     I'd love to participate in something like this, If I can get the time 
off and get my bus ready for it.  I could bring along a compressor and my 
Lincoln HandyMig welder (110v wire feed, with gas).  I can also weld, not 
great because I'm just a beginner, but well enough for painting with some 
grinding and filling.  I've also got a ton of hand tools like an angle 
grinder, air tools, etc.
     About a location, what about a local fair grounds?  They set unused 
allot, at least they do around here, so I am sure we could find a date when 
one is open.  They usually have several large buildings and an electrical 
supply, port potties if not flush facilities, and huge fields that could be 
used for camping.  This would possibly mean a facilities fee, and I don't 
know if that would be cost prohibitive or not, but it's just a thought.
