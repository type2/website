Subject: Re: Plug Socket, Dist, Points

&gt;Thanks for everyone earlier in the week who encouraged me to change my 
points, condensor, etc by myself. 
&gt;I wasn't able to get the distributor off my '79 Type II engine. Even 
with an offset box wrench, even if I CAN get the wrench on the nut to 
the right of the disty, I have no way to turn it. Does anyone have any 
tricks on how I can get this thing out of my motor?
&gt;
Sure, it's easy.  You may first have to change the position of the 
distributor in order to remove the hold-down nut.  You do this by 
locating the long 10mm nut toward the FRONT (front is front!) of the 
distributor.  It sticks out to the right side of the distributor.  Put 
your 10mm open end wrench on this and loosen it.  Now you can turn the 
distributor body by hand to make room to get a wrench on the hold-down 
nut.  Once you remove the hold-down nut, then the distributor simply 
lifts off straight up.



&gt;What I ended up doing was changing the points while the disty was still 
installed. It went OK, no screws dropped, and everything checks out OK: 
dwell, timing, etc., except I couldn't get the condensor off. Is this a 
big deal?
&gt;
You should generally replace the points and condenser together.  You 
have to remove the distributor, however, to replace the condenser.  
There are two screws that hold the condenser on.  One is a screw that 
holds a metal clip to the distributor body.  The metal clip is what 
keeps the condenser's plastic plug in the side of the distributor body.  
The other screw actually holds the condenser itself to the distributor.



&gt;Now to the plugs: I bought an extended 21mm socket and went to town. On 
the two rear cylinders, once the plugs screwed loose, they dropped on to 
the block (?) and needed to be fished out from underneath the sheet 
metal shroud that I can barley get two fingers into. I was able to do 
that using a piece of looped wire and hooking the bent electrode and 
slowly pulling them out (Don't ask why I didn't have my handy magnet 
tool). Now my qyestion is how the hell I'm supposed to get them back 
in?! Is there such a thing as a magnetized socket for these things? Did 
I buy the wrong tool?
&gt;
This happens all the time.  Any time you remove a Type 4 engine from the 
van and remove the cylinder tin, you are pretty much guaranteed to find 
a couple spark plugs sitting on top of the heads.  The easy way to 
recover them is to use a telescoping magnet tool (best $3 I ever 
spent!).  

However, it sounds like you need to buy a spark plug socket.  There are 
sockets specifically made for removing and installing spark plugs. They 
have a rubber insert inside that grabs the plug and keeps it from 
falling out of the socket.  You will not be able to re-install them 
(well, you might be able to if you are very patient and creative) unless 
you are using a spark plug socket.  Hopefully you have another ride to 
the tool store :-)
