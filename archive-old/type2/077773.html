Subject: Re: [T2] Heating possiblities



&gt; Hi Jim,
&gt; 
&gt; Sounds like the perfect answer for a singlecab or double-cab, they 
wouldn't
&gt; have to put it on the roof, it could go in one of the lower 
bulkheads.
&gt; 
&gt; If I sealed the space under the rear-facing seat airtight, would an 
EU2000i
&gt; fit? How many decibels does it crank out?

If you want heat, remember that a generator puts out about three times 
the power produced as waste heat (2nd law of thermo).  All you need to 
do is put the generator in the space to be heated and duct the exhaust 
outside.  The cooling air from a 2kW generator would provide 6+ kW of 
heat!

A Honda generator is actually quiet and civilized enough that you 
might be able to live with it in the passenger compartment.

This idea is rather far fetched, but it _would_ work.  I don't think 
I'm cold enough yet to try it!

George
