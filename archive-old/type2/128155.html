Subject: Re: [T2] I'm starting to get it!

&gt;You might stop to wonder how all of us who *do*
know how to work on an engine learned it....

I didn't know how to chekc my oil when I bought
my first bug. 

&gt;Anyone know if there is a model Volkswagen
engine? I'd settle for a beetle engine, but would
probably pay double for a pancake.  

Sure, I'll bet you can buy a worn out engine from
the local VW wrench for almost nothing.  Your
kids won't care if the case has a hole in it and
the valve seats are shot.  Clean it up and paint
the parts different colors if your really want to
make it kid friendly.  



Similar
to the plastic &quot;working&quot; V8's they sell during
Christmas time.  My
boys aren't old enough for that yet (so my wife
tells me. :-P)  Maybe
there are wooden craft plans... A quick google
search didn't produce
much.
