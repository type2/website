Subject: Re: [T2] Holes in air cleaner

Same thing on my bus.

Backfire protection?

The Porsche 911 came (or maybe it was aftermarket?) with pop-off valves to 
keep from damaging the air cleaner I think it was in case of backfire).


&gt;Did a PO drill some holes in my air cleaner cover on did it come from the
&gt;factory like this?
