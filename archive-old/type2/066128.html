Hi,

Just a few comments. And please keep in mind that I don't mean to flame 
you here, I really am just voicing disagreements I have with some of the 
things you said.

&gt; &gt;now,admittedly, during one eight-hour shift, a LOT of new autos are built,
&gt; &gt;so the pollution from the workers autos is divided by that number. but still
&gt; &gt;it's a lot of cars. and it doesn't count all the roads that have to be
&gt; &gt;maintained for those cars to get to work at the auto plant. ;)
&gt; 
&gt; Which of course is true when you buy any *other* manufactured product, thus
&gt; proving that you are &quot;causing&quot; incalculable pollution when you buy a pack
&gt; of gum or pay your mortgage. I think Uncle Joel's message is genius for its
&gt; absurdity, which I'm sure is intentional. People get hysterical about this
&gt; (which should tell you that there is more emotion than reason at work and
&gt; should make any conclusion automatically suspect) (except mine of course
&gt; ;).

Actually, this reasoning does work just fine. Of course, resources used 
have to be amortized over the number of products made. In the case of a 
pack of gum the amortization is going to bring the resource use down to a 
hopefully reasonable level because _so_ much gum can be produced in a day 
by a relatively small number of people. However, I think we'd all be 
surprised (and hopefully a little bit appalled) by the amount of 
oil/pollution etc. involved in producing even a pack of gum.

&gt; 
&gt; --Pollution is benign. Pollution *in concentration* is dangerous, possibly
&gt; deadly. It's the effect of it that concerns; no harm no foul. If you want
&gt; to pollute less, drive the same car just as often but move to the country.
&gt; Or work second shift, or third (third shift is driver's paradise). Parts
&gt; per million don't matter; health matters.

There is more to pollution than just local concentration when you have 
such a huge global population all polluting like crazy. CO2 becomes a 
global problem when it changes the atmospheric mix, and eventually it 
becomes a health matter when world ecology if affected. If we're going to 
do things like drive cars, then in my opinion it's our responsibility to 
understand that parts per million do matter because there is a causal 
link between PPM and health.

&gt; 
&gt; --If I tell you &quot;you are being prosecuted because you are harming
&gt; somebody,&quot; the logical question to ask is &quot;who am I harming?&quot; If the answer
&gt; is, &quot;well, SOMEBODY but I'm not quite sure who,&quot; then you should conclude
&gt; that I am merely interested in prosecution for its own sake. Crimes against
&gt; &quot;the environment&quot; are crimes against a specter. In what other instance are
&gt; you required to prove that you are innocent of the crime of &quot;harming&quot; a
&gt; politician's whim?

Crimes against the environment are crimes against local people and other
life, and eventually against global ecological health. Viewing it as a
specter is a view rapidly being abandoned by science (and reluctantly by the
rest of our society) that says that we can do anything we want with no
consequences if no one is aparently being directly harmed. But CFC's, CO2,
PCB's, pesticides, etc. have been viewed as harmless until we spewed enough
of them and developed technology to begin to measure and understand the huge
harm they are doing. And this process of cataloging the local and global
environmental damage we have done is really just beginning. 
 
&gt; &gt; --If you want to pollute less, those of you who are carbeurated can burn
&gt; alcohol (which becomes nothing but CO2 and H2O) with no modification but a
&gt; change of jets. This will run you $7-10 per gallon, which is expensive
&gt; compared to gasoline but very cheap compared to a new car. You might even
&gt; help to make the next oil war not worth fighting--a helluva lot of Beetles
&gt; in Brazil run on what is essentially 200 proof rum. I am &lt;that close&gt; to
&gt; doing this.

Alcohol is a very tempting alternative. Locally produced, and the CO2
released when alcohol is burned is the same CO2 that was absorbed by the
plants during their lives. I really do hope that eventually in conjunction
with lessening the amount of overal energy consumption, this becomes viable. 

&gt; 
&gt; Just stirring the pot. This thread has been admirable because it could have
&gt; been a flame war, but wasn't. I'd hate to see that tarnished.

Please don't take my disagreement with you as a flame. And I hope you don't
view what I'm saying as emotional hyperbole. There is a lot of hard science
(more all the time) which points to the reality of global environmental harm
we're doing. 

I love my VW. I know it pollutes more than a new car. I have a feeling 
(and I really, really  hope) that it's still an environmental win when 
the consequences of new car building are taken into account.

Jon
