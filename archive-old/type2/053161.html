Subject: refillable paint cans

Tony--

  There is also the Preval brand of refillable paint spray bottles (they've been around for at least 20 years)--we had our paint color for the ghia made up for us and used the Preval sprayer to do some painting in the engine compartment.  We were quite pleased with the results--it worked much better than spray paint ever does (partly, of course because of the higher quality of the paint we used).  Anyway, we can recommend it for touch ups and even somewhat larger areas.

'81 Westy (new poptop seal going on this week, hopefully--ghia comes first!)
'69 Karmann Ghia (engine going back in this weekend!)
