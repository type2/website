Subject: Re: [T2] engine door seal

Hiya John,

West Coast Metric sells a engine door seal kit.  Basically it's just four 
pieces of rubber seal which you cut to fit.  Good WCM quality.

I'd be wary of the one piece engine door seals.  I purchased one online 
recently and it wasn't even close to the correct dimensions.  This thing was 
way too large and I have the big door (1970).  If you do go the one piece 
route and get a good one, I'd appreciate hearing from you about it.  I'd 
still like to find a good one piece seal.

Mike
