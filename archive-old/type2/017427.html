Subject: 30/31 PICT Warning

I'm sure that this has been discussed before; but it seems worth another
posting.

STORY:
Earlier this week, I was called upon to help a friend who's '71 standard
beetle wasn't running well, and finally couldn't start.  Lifting the
hatch immediatly displayed the problem: the plug on the rear (rear is
rear) of the 'universal' replacement carb (30/31 PICT, Brosol, Brazil)
had defeated the three flimsy peans used to hold it in place and had
popped out and disappeared.  So I carefully ground down a dime a mm or
two all around and peaned it in place.  Yesterday, I had just picked up
a passenger at the airport and was starting up my '71 bus when I got a
funny little backfire and terrible idle.  Lifting the hatch, what did I
see but the same problem.  This time, the plug was to be found off to
the right side of the engine compartment, and I was able to pean it back
in place with a tire iron and a hiking book (courtesy of my amused
passenger).

MORAL:
If you have one of these carbs, pean that plug better, ASAP.
