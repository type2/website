&gt; Hey, what exactly is &quot;sealing wax red&quot;? Is that the persimmony color? Is it
&gt; almost exactly the color of red primer but with a gloss to it?

&gt; I think that's what mine is. Primer, I mean. ;)

I'm not sure, but from the paint chips, it was the standard VW red from 
the mid 50s thru the end of the split window era. Sealing wax (the 
actual stuff) is a bright red, not quite as dark as fire engine red. 
&gt;From the chip info, I assume it to be &quot;standard VW red&quot; (ala beetle).

Ummm... I guess that &quot;Beetle red&quot; isn't a good example. The yellow 
binders in that color were so unstable, they'd start changing shade the 
moment ultraviolet light hit them. When I worked in the local VW 
dealership, they'd mix a generous slop of primer oxide into a new quart 
of VW red to make it match. When it left the shop, it was the same dull, 
dark red. In 2 years, the fender would be a totally different color.

BTW, there was also a much darker red on some later vans. It's not in my 
paint codes, because they don't cover vans after '68.
