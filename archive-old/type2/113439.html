Subject: &quot;NEW&quot; T-II or New EuroVan???

Want as close to as new a T-II as you can get, rather than a new EuroVan at 
$45,000?

Remove engine trans axles doors lids trim bumpers interior windows dash and 
harness.

Strip to bare metal, replace rusted or damaged panels, knock out all the 
dimples.

Do three coats of sandable primer, prep and paint.

At this point you will have $7000 to $10,000 in if the work is being done 
by skilled journeymen.

Add $2000 for reassembly with reman motor ($2500) tranny ($800) cv's 
($400), brakes ($300) and allow $1000 for other contingencies like glass 
seals and lifts, clutch, exhaust, hoses, tie rods, ball joints, filters, 
wiring harness.....

Add it all up and $15,000 is in the neighborhood of the cost of doing it 
all right. I suggest that a very good candidate for restoration may only 
need $10,000 whereas some couldn't be made right for $20,000.

Consider also that this &quot;NEW&quot; 70's T-II will in 20 more years probably be 
worth much more than a 20 year old EuroVan with 20 extra funky switches and 
relays for the bells and whistles.

Is a &quot;NEW&quot; T-II worth half or 1/3rd the cost of a NEW EuroVan?? If driving 
a new EruoVan has $30,000 or more of status value to you, you know what to 
do. If it doesn't, you know what to do.

How many people would be interested in buying a DM &quot;NEW&quot; T-II??? I am 
considering setting up such a production, but must get a measure of the 
viable market. If it looks like the market wants a dozen a year or more, 
I'll probably do it. Vanagons could be included for a bit more. I would set 
this operation up on the mainland, somewhere in the Rockies and West. Of 
course, I would also provide complete maintenance and repair as well for 
the locals.

Anybody know of a journey level body/paint guru wanting to fill his hours 
with putting out quality craftsmanship, ask them to get in touch. Wages or 
joint ownership/investment will be considered. Location as well is 
negotiable as long as fishin' water is not too far away.
