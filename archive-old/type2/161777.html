Subject: injector problem-me

Was preparing to try and manually ground the injectors while cranking when it
occured to me that MAYBE I should try some standard troubleshooting first
(like everyone else).  Bartnik's FI guide and Vintagebus's schematics later, I
found I had a dead 86c on my double relay.  Rooted around and found a black
fused wire, got a continuity hit with 86c, hooked it up to terminal 15
(positive post of coil) and voila, she runs.

Right and wrong at the same time.  Whoda thunk.JT Beaufort, SC
