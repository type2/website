Subject: Re: [T2] 1979 Rear Wheel Bearings?  HELP!

&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt;
&gt; I've been noticing a ~CLUNK~ type noise coming from the right-rear of my
&gt; 1979 Westy when I go over bumps, and checked it out yesterday.  I pulled off
&gt; the wheel and unbolted the brake drum, and was able to move the stub axle
&gt; in-and-out about 1/8&quot; by hand.  That would explain the ~CLUNK~ noise!

There really isn't a spec, but I find that they develop more and more play
as time goes on and that you are at about the point where replacement is
in the cards.  If your hub/stub axle has *any* front/back or up/down
play... it is shot and needs replacement now!

&gt; Obviously, it's something to do with the bearings, but what?

It's the inner (ball) bearing wearing out.

&gt; Do they just need repacking with grease and readjusting?

There is no adjustment. It's *barely* possible that regreasing will help,
but as much work as it is to get to them, replacement is the only option
in my book.

&gt; Or, do I need to remove the entire assembly and replace the seals and
&gt; bearings?

Yup.  'Fraid this is the job you face.

&gt; It has been doing this for about 3,000 miles.

Tough beasts, ain't they?  I went ~1,000 mi on a loose axle nut before Dr.
Tim figured out what it was.  Then drove south, had the nut loosen again
around Fresno, and drove on to LA.  Replaced the bearings there and it
turned out the race for the outer bering was split across its face.

&gt; I believe one can't adjust rear bearings the same way one can adjust
&gt; the front.

Believe it. There is no adjustment possible.

&gt; In addition, I helped a friend with his sag correction and
&gt; rear bearing replacement on his '71, and agree with the general
&gt; consensus that Bentley is a pretty poor resource for this job.  Does
&gt; anybody know of a better resource?

Nope.  I found Bentley to be just fine. The only real sticking point is
getting the stub axle out and now that I have the big puller, even that is
not a problem any more.

&gt; My friend will be helping me, but I'm sure that '71 is different from
&gt; '79.

1971-1992 are all the same.  The only difference between the V'gon and the
bay is that the bearing housing on the V'gon comes off, so you can do it
on the bench (a HUGE advantage!!!)
