BS?  Hmmmm. You might want to go here http://193.193.216.232/english/ as
Elring disagrees with you. Dirko and other silicones are *not* for use with
anything that sees fuel...period. Curil T is acceptable but usually only on
non-gasketed applications.  Worst possible use for silicone sealants I've
ever seen.

The reason you have &quot;success&quot; with silicone on any fuel related flange is
that it's a good enough seal to begin with, tolerances with the gasket are
sufficient and additional sealer is superfluous. I've seen plenty of intake
manifolds on various makes where owners used silicone to accommodate a poor
fit and they all eventually failed. You'll never see silicone sealant on an
OEM installed, fuel related component for that reason.  Drop a cured blob of
silicone in a gallon of gas and see what happens.

It misleads the novice, who may need to remove studs, remove raised metal,
clearance mating parts and insure proper fit from the start to say silicone
is ok on flanges in potential contact with fuel.  If it makes contact it
will fail.

BS.  Particularly on the intake it isn't going to ever &quot;see fuel&quot; in any
concentrated form.  You all do what you will, I've used Dirko on GAS
TANK grommets on Vanagons and seen it still just fine 5 years later
when I pulled the tank.

Again I'm not talking about gooping crap on so that it sqeezes into
the runners, I'm talking a thin layer compressed on the gasket that
will never be touched by fuel, air, or anything else till the day someone
removes the runner.

YMMV.
