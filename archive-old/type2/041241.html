Subject: Bus Depot flooded

We got hit with a flash flood here today, the worst I've ever seen. I was
about to trade in my Westy for an ark!  To make matters worse, a drainage
pipe failed right in front of the shop, dumping 2 feet of rushing water
directly into our front door.  Water was pouring in through every crack and
crevice in the front of the building!  I now know that a flat poptop seal
can be a somewhat useful tool in holding back flood waters when wedged under
a door.

Thanks to lots of fast moving and bailing of water, we managed to move
virtually all of the parts that were near the front of the building to
higher ground, so there is little long-term damage, but the cleanup is
likely to take a good day or so.  As a result we may be an extra day behind
on orders this week, and we may be slow to answer the phones or even shut
them off part of tomorrow and/or Wednesday, while we try to put our shop
back together, bring in big fans and dehumidifiers, etc.  We will continue
shipping even during the cleanup, and expedited orders (overnight, 2nd day,
3rd day) will definately ship on schedule even if we have to swim to
assemble them!  :-)
