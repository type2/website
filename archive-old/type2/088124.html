Subject: Re: [T2] Eberspacher help needed

warm as toast on their own exhaust heater exchange. BN2s were designed for
the larger and chillier buses, especially for camping. Am I missing
something here?  Jan B

i am looking for a copy of the template and tech manual for a BN2 heater.I
am installing in a 74 Beetle...............
