I had the same problem continuously with my 69. I think it was either a worn
axle stub or the splines in the drum I never knew which. if you look at the
inside of the drum where it contacts the bearing surface i believe you will
find it wearing away due to this play in the splines.

PS you will get lots of weird noises like thumps squeaks grinds etc when it
is loose.
