&gt; I have a 78 bus, I have changed the front bushing and the cage on the
&gt;  shifting rod. I can't seam to adjust it to get third and forth gear. It
&gt;  also wants to go into reverse when I try to shift to second. tried to
&gt;  adjust like in the Bentley book but no go. If I loosen adjusting plate I
&gt;  can get third and forth but not with bus moving.

If you have changed the front bushing then you must have removed the front 
shift rod so it could be worth checking that  front and back rods are 
correctly aligned so that the set screw goes into the indentation on the rear 
rod - but don't do that yet as there are other things easier to check.

Now as you don't mention removing the engine and gear box that by the 'cage' 
you mean the guide plate at the base of the gear stick. It is worth checking 
that you have this the right way round. The vertical flanges should go up 
from the plate and the long flange should be on the right of the bus.

Adjustment of the plate is counter intuitive until you realise that as it is 
below the pivot point, so to make the top of the stick move less to the left 
then the plate has to be moved towards the left of the bus.

In your case of being able to engage reverse instead of second this is 
exactly what you need to do.
To ensure that you are in second when you make the adjustment select first 
gear and (after loosening the bolts just enough to be able to move the plate) 
move the plate to the left until it just touches the bulge on the stick, then 
select second gear (you might need to nip the bolts tight to do so) and make 
an adjustment to the plate so that the lower part of the gear stick is at 
right angles to the floor in all directions, then nip the bolts up and test 
selection of the other gears.

When happy do a final tightening before a road test.

Of course no 20+ year old mechanism will conform exactly to the 
specifications of a new vehicle so don't be too paranoid about the 90 degrees 
if it works for you at 80 then that's fine.

Good luck and a happy new year
