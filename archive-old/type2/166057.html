While it makes it a bit easier if you already have the stock EFI 
installed, it is not required.  Since I did have the stock system 
installed, I just chopped the old wiring harness and wired it into my MS 
system.  I hacked a double relay such that the MS is hard-wired into the 
double relay, but the fuel pump and main EFI power can still plug into 
the left side of the double relay.  This allows me to switch back and 
forth between the stock and MS systems.  I use the stock Aux air valve, 
injectors, and temp sensor.  I left the AFM in place because it already 
has the air filter housing but I wired the flapper vane open.  I drilled 
a hole in the S-tube and glued a GM temp sensor in the tube.

If you were doing a change-over from carbs, you'd need to get a fuel 
pump, intake manifold, injectors (for port or throttle body injection), 
and a throttle body.  The S-tube would help as you could utilize the 
stock aux air valve or employ a later-type valve using the bypass into 
the manifold.  Resistor packs are not required.

Or, check this out:

this guy is using gsxr1000 throttle bodies and makes for a nice clean 
installation.
