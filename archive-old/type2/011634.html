To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

thought id throw in my $.02,
as far as whether or not your son is ready to tour at
16 is your business, you know him better than all of
us.   i really think gauges such as those listed in
earlier posts such as oil pressure, head temp, oil
temp, etc. would be helpful, but it all depends on the
driver.   my wife who i love dearly, likes to drive
cars till they do not go, regardless of what the
gauges may tell.   so if you have a driver who does
not know there way around a car, or who doesnt pay
attention even a little bit, a small problem could
turn BIG.   just something to think about.   however
if he is so inclined im sure he would have a stellar
time.   by the time i was 18 i had about 3 long
distance trips of 800 miles or more under my belt
including a cross country and back jaunt in a $50
dodge van, so it certainly can be done.   good luck
none the less.   oh and thom as far as money is
concerned, i too am tied now by a mortage, but travel
is cheap when done in numbers.   4 of us went from
nebraska to NY in my bus this summer.   took 3 days
travel time.   
expenses: 
lodging: Free
food:   $15 total for all of us, purchased before we
left.
gas:  ~$40 each
grand total of $44 bucks a piece to drive 1/2 way
across the united states
it can be done.
have a great day!

&gt; &gt;Someone asked what gauges they would want their 16

&gt; &gt;for a safe &quot;mega tour&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; My answer would be:
&gt; 
&gt; 	it's never safe for 16 years olds to go on a
&gt; mega-tour alone,
&gt; 	no matter what vehicle or how many gauges you give
&gt; them.
&gt; 
&gt; But it's up to each individual to decide what they
&gt; allow their children to
&gt; undertake.
&gt; 
&gt; Having said that, the bus needs a thorough check-up
&gt; and reliable engine. If
&gt; it is now being overhauled you need to allow
&gt; sufficient time to make sure it
&gt; really is reliable. In practice failures tend to
&gt; show up in the first so
&gt; many hours after 'repairs'. And of course after a
&gt; rebuild the engine needs
&gt; running in. Finishing the repairs just hours before
&gt; they are about to leave
&gt; on a major trip is not a good idea.
&gt; I would say you need to allow for at least 2 to 4
&gt; weeks running the car
&gt; around town before sending them off. You have to
&gt; realise that with older
&gt; cars problems can always occur so make sure these
&gt; kids know what to do in
&gt; case of a breakdown. In these circumstances a
&gt; working mobile phone is
&gt; probably the most important 'gadget'.
&gt; 
&gt; Just the other day I got a call from my son who is
&gt; taking my '81 Vanagon on
&gt; a vacation in Germany / France. The car was well
&gt; prepared but on the second
&gt; day he had a little melting / burning plastic under
&gt; the dash. Turned out to
&gt; be the 4 position heater blower switch. He 26 now
&gt; and knows nothing about
&gt; cars and probably never will (but ask him about
&gt; applied physics and he's
&gt; your man). As he was in Germany I told him to find a
&gt; VW dealer, so he did.
&gt; One hour later and 8 dollars lighter he was on his
&gt; way again. If only every
&gt; problem was so simple .....
