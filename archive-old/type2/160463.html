Subject: Re: [T2] No start after running

&gt;Diagnosis for a 1600dp stock:
&gt;
&gt;*       Checked timing statically because I can not get it to start to
&gt;use the strobe, approximately 7.5 ATDC

Should be 00 TDC, at the pulley mark. That will
make a big difference. Set point gap to 0.016.
Sounds like the dizzy slipped. Not unusual with
the usual case of the clamp being over tightened
way too much way too many times.

&gt;*       Pulled plugs and regapped them all to .028
&gt;
&gt;         *       Plug #2 was fouled black but the others were just fine,
&gt;#2's gap was also .035

If that is due to wear from an original gap of
0.028, replace them. Worn electrodes do not
spark very well at all compared to sharp, new
electrodes. Note also that stock gap is 0.024.

Stock Bosch plugs and parts, stock gap points and
plugs, stock timing, put it all back to stock specs.

Your symptom can indeed be caused by a weak
spark. Old/worn plugs, low battery due to many causes, resistance in wires
or connections from battery to coil or ground,
old starter just using far more amps leaving not enough volts to power the
coil, wrong point gap, flaky condenser (very rare if Bosch), old HT
wires......

Correct all maintenance and adjustments first, then BEGIN diagnosis.
