&gt; So now I've discovered that someone cut this hole in my bus so as to replace
&gt; the fuel tank sending unit without pulling the engine and gas tank. Several
&gt; have suggested that there is no way to fix this at home. It was suggested
&gt; that a good body shop would be able to cut a section from another bus and
&gt; replace it, making look new if they were good enough. 

As one of those people, I resemble that remark! :-)

&gt; However, this would
&gt; land us back in the place of having to pull the engine and tank in order to
&gt; replace the unit.

Yup!  Stock is better!  :-)  OK, I admit it, I am a stock-freak...  a
vintage pervert! When I see a rear deck cut to replace the gas tank sender
(and I have seen more than a few :-(,  I figure at least one of the
previous owners did not have enough brains to use a screwdriver!  Removing
the gas tank is just not that difficult!!!!! Cheese Marie!  it is only a
couple screws and lower the engine a couple inches! You don't even have to
disconnect it! 

&gt; I think maybe a better approach to this problem is to find a way to make the
&gt; access hole less of an eye sore. I haven't taken a real close look at the
&gt; hole yet. What I have in mind is to cut off the flap of metal that remains.
&gt; Then fashion a small frame to fit the resulting hole. At that point, hinges
&gt; and a lid could be attached so that the hole at least has a finished and
&gt; intentional look to it.
&gt; 
&gt; What does everyone/anyone think??

Smittie, 

Since your bus has already been cut, I see no harm in this approach. If it
were me, I would go to a boating supply store, or better yet (shameless
plug) a web site like sailnet_dot_com (1) and look for a screw-in deck
hatch.  Boaters have occasion to cut access hatches all the time and boat
suppliers provide after-market deck hatches that are neat and waterproof
for reasonable prices.  A short search turned up this:
http://sailnet_dot_com/store/item.cfm?pid=4264
which would fitm be neat, and level the bed, tho it would require a bit of
cutting.
