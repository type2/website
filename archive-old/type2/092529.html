&gt;If you're going as far as Independence, and have some fishing poles, you 
&gt;might try this - in the middle of Independence there's a traffic light and 
&gt;a road that heads up west (left) into the Sierras (name of road escapes 
&gt;me, but it's pretty obvious).  Drive up this road about six miles (not 
&gt;very steep yet) to the Onion Valley campground.  Park where you can, then 
&gt;wander through the campsites down to Independence Creek (you can't see it, 
&gt;but you can see all the trees, that's the creek) and you'll find this 
&gt;idyllic little place where the path follows the creek up and downriver and 
&gt;it's just really pretty and hey! there's plenty of trout in there!
&gt;If you really want to seriously hike and maybe backpack camp away from 
&gt;your bus - take the Onion Valley road further all the way to the top 
&gt;(another five miles maybe?) and you can hike up the Kearsarge Pass 
&gt;-astoundingly beautiful, other people there but never too many...

Oooh, I've been there and so has my bus!  :)  Just a couple of comments on 
Onion Valley.  If I remember it was one of those rare 2nd gear roads.  The 
parking area at the top is just shy of 10,000 ft. elevation and the trail 
goes UP from there.  I hiked it with a large backpack and had to stop often 
because of the thin air.  The Onion Valley parking lot is one of the 
closest places to access the John Muir trail, which winds through the 
Eastern Sierras.  It's only a couple of miles from the road.  Astoundingly 
beautiful country - not as heavily forested as the Western side (Yosemite, 
Sequoia, Kings Canyon) but plenty of lakes and scraggly pine trees.  Be 
well prepared if you decide to go up the trail as it can get very cold at 
night and there are few people around to help if you have trouble.  Good 
hiking boots are a must.
