&gt; Q1: should i get the AC fixed or should i rip it out?
&gt; 
Rip it out dude!

&gt; Q2: why is it having trouble (almost sounds like it's missing) when it's cold and i push it to high RPMs?
&gt; 
The FI runs ridiculously rich in cold weather for a minute or so... I
have the same problem if I try to drive right away in the winter, in the
summer it is fine... but since you're in dallas, something may be
screwed up.  

&gt; possibly related Q3: am i hurting my bus by putting high-octane unleaded in it?
&gt;
Just your wallet ;-)
