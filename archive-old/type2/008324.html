Subject: throtle cable sticks...
To: type2 mailinglist &lt;type2_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Hey everyone!


My throtle cable seems to be sticking a lot lately and I want to deal
with it once and for all. 

I used a bit of grease on the cable where it comes out of the cooling
tin and that helped a bit, but not much. I really dont' think that is
where the problem lies, though. I think it's more to the front of the
bus.

Here's the deal:

~'69 Westy with 30/31 carb
~no recent work that would cause this

It's because of laziness (that and the fact I'm working 6 10 hour days
a week) that I turn to the list for such a BS fix. I don't wanna tear
into it and self-diagnose; I don't have the time!

I especially don't want to take the splash-plate off the front unless
I need to. 

Tomorrow is my &quot;one&quot; day off this week and I'd like to fix it. Any
ideas to save me from wasting time on such a foolish (but dangerous)
problem?



Jaime
