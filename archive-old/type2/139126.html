Subject: Shifter feels loose.

I started the spring cleaning on my Bay this weekend and noticed that the
shifter feels loose.  It has probably been this way for a while, but when I
drive it everyday in the warmer weather I may have gradually gotten worse
without me noticing.
Any tips on what I should be looking for...and where...and what to
tighten/replace would be appreciated.
