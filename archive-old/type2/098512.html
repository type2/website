Subject: Fuel Injection Woes.....

Howdy Volks!

I'm hoping some of you gurus can help me with my poor bus......

1978 2L FI Automatic Stock (this bus was bought in CA when new.)

I recently replaced my AFM due to bad testing specs per the Bentely manual after ruling out the fuel pump as a problem, checking all the vacuum lines, adjusting the mixture,timing is correct, plugs are new.

After I installed the AFM and set the mixture again, I'm having the same exact problem.

When I take my foot off of the gas pedal, or even just let up a little, the engine just shuts off. Stop and go has just become stop and get frustrated, then restart. It doesn't always start right away after dying either. I only have start problems immediately after it dies on the road, never any other time. Sometimes I can keep it alive by throwing it in neutral and giving it gas throughout the stop, then throw it back in first when its time to go, but this is no way to drive and it only works half of the time anyways. This was the same thing that the bus was doing before I replaced the AFM. There is also resistance/hesitation at around 40mph and it won't go over 60.

My stepfather, a 25 year mechanic with previous experience with this bus, could not figure it out either. He was actually in the cargo area while I was driving adjusting the mixture as I drove, to no avail. What a guy, huh?

Whats going on? Have we missed something? I'd really like to hear all possibilities from you guys, then I'll rule things out one by one. I'm hoping its some stupid little thing.

Thanks in advance for all the help
