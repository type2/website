and pull/push it out once the pump and drain outlets clear.

Some observations:

- the fittings, pump and drain valve, are normal plumbing fitting and
require some plumbers tape to seal them back up.

- buy new clamps (general rule) because the old gemi clamps are hard to
tighten without the screwdriver slipping and it's murder working in that
space.

- if the drain valve is frozen, take it off force before trying to force it
open so you don=B9t damage the threads holding it to the tank.

broke when the hose came off so you'll need to reseal it. I used silicone.

- a chlorine bleach solution did wonders to clean it up.  It wasn't that
