Various VW aircooled engines have been turbocharged, but I don't think
that a turbo bus would be successful.  Turbos are good for momentary
bursts of power only, unless major upgrades are done to the cooling
systems.  If you try to pull 100 HP continuously out of an engine witha
50HP cooling system (say, to climb a hill), something will melt!
Unfortunately, VW aircooled
cooling systems are not easily improved, since the depend upon the finning
to move the heat out.
