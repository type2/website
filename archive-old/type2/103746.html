Subject: Bus wrapping

I contacted the company that does this in the Pacific Northwet and they said
that my vehicle is too old, even though it has lots of space for
advertising.  You have to meet their driving needs such as living in a
highly populated area, and drive at least 200 miles a week.  Since the vinyl
they use is printed out in a pattern for a specific vehicle they don't have
patterns that go back more than 10 years.  If you live in Britain you can
get a free Swatch car to drive around as long as you meet the requirements.
I'm pretty sure that they wrap more recent vehicles such as the new Beetle,
and Jettas.
If anyone on the list works for a company that produces plastics that we
could wrap our busses with I'm sure that we could advertise the Type 2 list,
or our favorite shop.  It would make it a lot easier to try new paint
schemes if we could test them out with a vinyl application first.
