I sure hope you have better luck with the one you got than the one I 
had.  When Chris and I put the engine in my westy I tried to replace the 
bushings.  The shuttlecock ones wouldn't fit.  It's possible NuVintage 
gave me some sort of bug part.  I hope that's the case.  If not the 
quality and fit of the reproduction crap shifter bushings is terrible. 
In the end I was able to reuse some old shuttlecock ones.  As I recall 
there were three + the donut.
