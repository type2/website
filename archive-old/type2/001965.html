In reference to your colors, if the upper color is a pumpkin color, most =
likely it is a Bright Orange 99L2169. This past fall I took out all my =
rust, dents and etc on my 79 Transporter.  A NAPA auto parts store help =
me find the colors in one of their older books and mixed the paint. You =
will also need a harder and depending on the temp if done outside a =
booth, a medium to fast thinker.  Once the paint is hard, about 30 days, =
you can buff it out and it sure knocks your eyes out.  For those who =
might have the same color on the bottom with a Beige top, it is called =
Mexican Beige. NAPA's old color book has a number of 99L 22596.  =
Warning.  Both colors need lots of mixing before you add harder, =
anti-fish eye,  thinner or you will have multi-shades of either color. =
Once you have mixed the paint, the paint will stay good for about 30 =
days. I purchased my paint quart cans so that I can mix any amount for =
touch up later on.
