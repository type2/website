Subject: Re: [T2] going on a rust hunt

Don't use regular Bondo for fixing holes.

It is hygroscopic - it absorbs water and causes further rust under the repair.

Wire brush, grind - remove the rust on both sides. If it is small Swiss 
cheese rust then a coat of a rust converter (brush on only - the spray on 
doesn't coat well enough) and then a coat of metal impregnated body filler 
will do a good job. I have repaired battery trays successfully and the rust 
has not come back. I used rust converter I got at the hardware store not 
POR-15. I'm sure POR-15 is good - very good even - but I was trying to work 
with locally available supplies.

If it does rust out some day you might have to cut out the old steel and 
weld in new.

Metal impregnated filer is available at most professional body supply 
stores and most towns over 1K people will have a couple and our town is 
maybe 20K people.

Seam rust explanations I'll leave to other's on the list.

&gt;I sanded away some of the rust to  see what was going on, and read all the
&gt;rust maintenance articles on the type2_dot_com library, but what do I do with
&gt;this sort of situation? It's impossible to get the rust out of the heavy
&gt;pockmarked areas (should I use acid of some sort?), and do I need to worry
&gt;about the holes at the seam of the seat metal? Those holes would throw
&gt;water into the cab if I didn't patch them and was driving in the
&gt;rain...but is Bondo ok for this place, or  do I need to start budgeting
&gt;for a new floor panel (is that expensive??)?
