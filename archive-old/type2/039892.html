Volks, 

First, yes, $35 is a lot, for a paperback novel.  But if you think of it
as a text book, $35 starts looking *very* cheap!  Second, Bus Depot has
them for $27.95 (try to find anyone discounting text books!) and as others
have said, they are often to be found used.  Even at list price, tho, they
are worth every penny,

Average is when you learn from your mistakes;
stupid is when you don't;
smart is when you learn from *other's* mistakes.
