Subject: Condensation??

Hey guys,

	Quick question, I just wanted to make sure that this didn't cause
any kind of long term problem.
I have a 2bbl Webber carb on my 1.8. The carb is attached by a small plenum
which is met by 4 long intake tubes that curve around to the sides of the
motor (where the dual carbs are supposed to be).

Now, on the few occasions that I drive the Bus at night, I've noticed that
there is MAJOR condensation buildup. The top of the motor even becomes
soaked with water. At first I thought it was fuel and got worried. The
carburetor and everything is almost cold to the touch. In theory, this would
tell me that it's REALLY cold and that I'm probably getting better
horsepower.. but do you guys forsee any problem with this?

By the way, this is when it's like 85 degrees outside... but with 100%
humidity.
