Thanks again for all the suggestions

Here's one to watch for
I got hold of the right Condensor (condenser), I decided to take out the
distributer to check all was well, I discovered that the little braided cable
that goes between the case and vacuum advance plate had come off!

Eureka I thought, Ive found the problem, fixed it back on ..alas ... no
change.

I am finding so many things wrong with this engine that I am amazed it ever
worked?

I have now replaced the little bits of pipe between the carbs and the advance
tube....still won't accelerate properly. Also here are the results of my
Compression testing.. 

Cyl 1: 120
Cyl 2: 120
Cyl 3: 140
Cyl 4: 105

I am new to this sort of thing, but according to Muir, this shouldn't be
anything to wory about (after 108000 miles), with the possibility the ex valve
in 4 is not seating?
Would this cause my lack of power?
Any other interpretations of this data?

Please Pmail any suggestions (on   Digest)

Thanks again
