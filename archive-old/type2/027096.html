Subject: Re: [T2] continually tight valves; now: Two tdc's per cycle

Bob, Al, and List
Not sure about all that. I use the traditional Muir way of valve adjustment, 
TDC for #1, adjust, 180CCW, adjust#2, 180CCW, adjust#3, 180CCW, adjust#4. 
Maybe its CW, can't remember right now, but I check the book each time. This 
IS correct, right? I know there is the method of watching the intake/exhaust 
for a cylinder go up down each, then wait for an easy spot, turning CW, but 
the Muir degree method seems to work well for me. Al, are you saying I 
should adjust intake and exhaust for a particular cylinder?

&gt;
&gt;remember the crankshaft controls the pistons,  up and down
&gt;but the camshaft controls the valves  open and close
&gt;
&gt;the crankshaft is geared to the cam shaft at a 2:1 ratio thus the crank
&gt;goes around twice for each time the cam rotates

&gt; &gt; Wink, others:
&gt; &gt; I often wonder if the valve adjustment procedure IS understood by all 
&gt;who
&gt; &gt; attempt it.
&gt; &gt; (And I'm sure it is NOT, judging from what some people have written.)
&gt; &gt; Understand that each cylinder has TWO TDC's per cycle! That is, it takes 
&gt;TWO
&gt; &gt; complete revolutions to complete a cycle in a four-stroke cycle engine. 
&gt;(720
&gt; &gt; degrees)
&gt; &gt; When you want to adjust the valves the engine MUST be at IGNITION TDC 
&gt;for that
&gt; &gt; cylinder. In other words, at the end of the compression- beginning of 
&gt;the power
&gt; &gt; strokes.
&gt; &gt; The other TDC is at the end of the exhaust- beginning  of the intake 
&gt;strokes.
&gt; &gt; Are we all together on this?
&gt; &gt; Any questions? Class?
