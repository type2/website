Subject: measurement still needed

Hello,

I am still trying to figure out where the front emblem mounts on a 78 
Westfalia. My paint guy wants to get finished and it would be nice to drill 
the holes prior to painting.  This is the 73-79 size emblem that is approx 
7&quot; in diameter not the ealier 10&quot; size.

I need to know how far it is down from the bottom of the front grill to the 
edge of the emblem. If anyone has a 73-79 with the emblem I would greatly 
appriciate a measurement. I'd get it myself but not too many busses in my 
small town and most have the spare tire up front.

Thanks,
Brandt
