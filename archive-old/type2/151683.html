Subject: high altitude vac advance answered

Folks,

While looking for some other info on ignition systems I found this.

http://www.fefcholden_dot_org.au/techinfo/supercharge/norman5.html

It's about supercharging an Australian car, but the discussion of how the 
vacuum and centrifugal advance system works is priceless.

About the first 7 paragraphs or so with emphasis on the discussion of 
vacuum advance at high elevations.  This guy suggests that at elevations 
over 15,000 feet, vacuum advance would not work at all!

Read carefully!

Cheers, dave
