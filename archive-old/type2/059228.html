Subject: Installing new longblock ?'s

Volks:

New Mexican longblock should be here tomorrow, and if
all goes well, into the bus on Thursday.  I have a
number of questions which I should know the answer to,
but don't.  Any help would be appreciated.
1. Is there any way to test an alternator without
actually sticking it in the car?  We got an alternator
from a '74 Bug that had been through and engine fire;
it looks to be in fine shape, but I'd hate to get down
to Cincy and find out it doesn't work.  Also: I bought
an alternator fuel pump today and the woman said the
black plastic part that's with the original (generator)
fuel pump would work, but that I needed a new rod 1/4&quot;
shorter.  I did that, but it doesn't make much sense to
me sitting here.  To you?

2. I have a crankshaft pully from my original '71
engine.  Will the mark on the pully correspond with TDC
on the new engine?  If not, how do I find TDC since the
#1 piston's at TDC twice.  How do I keep from putting
the mark in 90 degrees wrong?  I know about the
screwdriver in the sparkplug hole trick, I'm just not
sure where to go from there.

3. How do I get the distributer close enough so that I
can start the engine and use my timing light?  I won't
be able to use a static timing light in setting the
engine up tomorrow since there'll be no power to the distributer...

4.  The heat risers appear to be solidly clogged.  I
have read the archives, and St. Muir, and since I don't
have access to an acetylene torch, I wonder if someone
has discovered a miracle chemical cure.  I also wonder
if the whole thing's not worth worrying about too much
(some people have said enough heat gets transmitted
through even a fully clogged tube to keep the carb from
icing). Muir says clogged riser can burn a rod.  Why? 
Don't most hot rodders close these off?

5.  Is there anything else I haven't thought of?  It
would truly be a pain for Brooks and I to drive there
and then not get the thing to run.  Remember, this is a
0 mile motor.

Thanks again, you guys are the best.  

Dan
