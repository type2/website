Well. If you have read my other posts, you'll know that I was having
troubles with my engine stumbling and missfiring,,, I TRIED everything,
dwell, timing, carbs, filters, then finally I hotwired the coil to the
battery,
No more problems! The start position had already stopped working, so that
should have been my first clue!
So I would like to replace my switch with a new, or used one,
I believe it is p/n 111 905 865F
Thanks!
