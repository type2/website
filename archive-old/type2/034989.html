Subject: fuel pump push rod--getting the right stroke height?

Hi, folks:

[Background: I damaged a push rod and intermediate 
flange by putting the longer push rod in with a fuel 
pump made for engines with alternators, not generators. 
(To allow for the position of the alternator, the with-
alternator pumps sit lower and take a shorter push rod 
to actuate them.)  We're pressing ahead now.]

[These reports are shorter and less melodramatic if I 
write them in the morning, rather than the evening, 
aren't they?]

I've got a new flange and push rod in place--the 
shorter (alternator) push rod to go with the low-
profile pump--with one gasket under the flange. The 
pushrod is coming up about 6mm above the flange at the 
top of its stroke, not the 13mm that Bentley 
prescribes. At the bottom of its stroke, it's about 
flush with the flange, not 6-7mm or so above it, as the 
manual calls for.  The length of travel, about 6mm, is 
correct. 

Needless to say, the pump won't pump.

Is there something going on here that I'm not getting?

Thanks,

Bill
