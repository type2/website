Subject: RE: Advice for the floor

Ply is good - didn't westies come with a ply floor originally?  I replaced
my floor with a sheet of 1/4&quot; ply on top of 2 layers of expanded
polyethylene sheeting, then stuck a sheet of vinyl flooring (linoleum) on
top of that.  I also took the precaution of spraying the floorpan with
waxoyl beforehand.  Most cars that I have taken the carpet out of seem to
have a thick layer of underfelt (like you would use in your house) directly
on the painted metal or on sound deadening pads, with carpet laid over this.
You could do the same, but make sure the felt is thick or the floor will end
up rippled.

&gt; A couple of days ago we ripped up the carpet in the bus to 
&gt; check out the
&gt; floor to see if it had any rust.  The good thing was there was
&gt; none....we have some scraps that we are going to use for the 
&gt; new carpet
&gt; we are putting down but what is the best thing to put underneath the
&gt; carpet?  We thought about plywood, or something along those lines but
&gt; don't know if that's the best idea.
