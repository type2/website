John said
$200-$250
each for heads.  Personally I'd never use a rebuilt head as Reichert has
the new German and you could get them together for about $250 each

You might want to check on those new Reichert heads again.  They are running
about $467 each on the low side.

You got me excited that they had gone down in price!!!
