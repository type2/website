Subject: Michelin Controversy


I agree that people should do the search (I think I did something like
&quot;michelin AND tread separat**&quot;). Go read it. What I thought was significant
about this is that there are a LOT of firsthand accounts of Michelin
disintegration that sound a lot alike. They nearly explode, at speed,
without any warning, causing body damage.

These are firsthand reports by people who have nothing apparent to gain,
and it seems foolish not to give it creedence.

To my knowledge there are no reports of (say) Yokohama or Firestone tires
doing this. I'm glad you've managed to survive this far, though, Bill. 8)

&gt;problems with them. That said, an archive search is always in order,
&gt;but I'm really skeptical, particularly of wisdom coming from
&gt;a Che*vy truck list- :)
