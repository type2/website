Subject: Re: [T2] Steering Dampener

I also use the local VW parts store to get numbers.  I have access to 
commercial desk and he knows i am only looking for the part number in 
his system.  According to VW about 50 percent of the inventory of 
busdepot, aircooled_dot_net, gowesty, RMMW, etc..... is NLA.  When the 
aftermarket suppliers say NLA then it is probably NLA in normal retail 
and head for the salvage specialist or start asking  lists like this one.

&gt; stopped
&gt; at a local VW dealer to check for this part. Guy made a show of looking 
&gt; it
&gt; up,
&gt; writing down the number and after leaving the parts area and coming 
&gt; back in,
&gt; told me
&gt; nobody makes it anymore. I said thanks for looking and ran back to my
&gt; computer to
&gt; order it.
