Subject: 70 and 74 Bus parts

Hey Y'all,
  I have a 70 Bus that I am keeping and a 74 Bus that I am parting. I am 
trying to decide what I need to keep for my 70.
  Are the steering boxes the same exept for the steering wheel splines? 
If I swap wheels will it work?
  Is the trans the same gear ratio?
Also I need the Engine tin that surounds the doghouse cooler. The 
triangle shaped piece and the duct that directs the air out the back. 
Does anyone have one of these?
In the engine compartment there is a bracket that is attached to the 
right fender well near the gas tank. Its 1in wide and about 3-4in long 
with two holes in it. What was mounted here?
Thanks
