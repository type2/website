Subject: Re: [T2] raising (ground clearance) a 71 type II

You probably don't put a lot of high speed mileage on
it either. Mine was topping the suspension travel
often which caused me to lose traction on the
slightest dips. A compromise would suffice. The CV
joint problem does need addressing as mine actually
chipped away because they were being forced beyond
their travel extremes. There are CV joints for sand
buggies that have more travel. I suspect that you will
likely run it until you actually need to replace them
though. I think in a situation like yours I would
investigate the larger diameter tires as a means to
higher ground clearance. You may need to relieve your
fenders some, especially if you use traction chains on
them, too. Consider a full belly pan so that when you
DO get high centered it will be easier to push off as
there will be little to snag on and get jammed. Years
ago JC Whitney sold air bags that you'd put under the
vehicle where you could access and hook a hose up to
the exhaust which inflated the airbag and lifted the
vehicle - so you could dig away at what it was high
centerd on or build up under the tires. -BaH
