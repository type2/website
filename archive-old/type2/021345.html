The one question that no one has yet asked is: Has this engine run since
the rebuild.  If not there may be deeper problems than ignition out of
time. Quiz her about the cam install.  Assertain that she did in fact,
properly set the cam to the crank.  Check the compression... check valve
adjustment.  The usual suspects...
