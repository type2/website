Subject: Re: [T2] Tennessee to Vermont in July

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; (thoughts of hitting NYC to see the WTC site being delayed
&gt;&gt; &gt; take the subway or train into Mannhattan, nearest parking space is
&gt;&gt; &gt; New Jersey!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Also, consider the height of your bus when looking at
&gt;
&gt; an experience to avoid if you can,

I've spent alot of time in Boston and Washington D.C. Both places are much
more fun if you just leave the vehicle at the first mass-transit stop you
find and taking the easy way from there.

Although, I may be tempted to take the bus into DC in the early AM on a
Sunday to get pics of it in front of various monuments!
