I've always heard to run on high octane to keep the
engine running smoother and cooler:)

Glad to hear your road trip went smoothly, i have a
'70 bus that makes a little noise when the clutch is
in, but not a lot of noise were it is at all
bothersome, you should with-out-a-doubt take it back
and have it serviced correctly. It should not be
making any noise if done correctly, and the noise will
only increase.
