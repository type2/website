Ben, if you cut yourself a 8-9 inch piece of new (stiff) gas tubing, you can
stick it on the end of the loosened plugs and twist them out easily. Same on
installation, use the hose to start it in, then pull it off the plug and use
your socket. I've quit dropping them since putting the piece of hose in the
toolbox, Regards, Marv Krupp
