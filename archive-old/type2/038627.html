Subject: New VW neighbors

A family moved into our neighborhood about 2 weeks ago with a brown
camper, but it's just been sitting...  We finally managed to get over to
their house this weekend and introduce ourselves.  Turns out the bus
is a '78 and they are the original owners!  He's done some long trips in
it, in the past, but he said there are some strange noises coming from the
engine.

Once they get all unpacked he wants to get it back on the road.  He's not
on the 'net yet, but I told him about the list.
