   Hey There.

  I've recently began to hear a creak when depressing the clutch cable in
the 73 Westy.
I lubed up the pivot point for the pedal and the creaking seemed to subside.
A few days later i thought ibetter pull the cable for an inspection and
found it frayed with about half the strands broken!
The damage was located inside the Bowden tube which was duct taped by the
PO.
I couldn't pull the cable through as the coil spring in the tube had let go
and was catching on the cable.
This is what trashed it.
I insalled and new cable and bowden tube and all is well:)

I also found the clutch tube had split at the welded mount at the rear
torsion bar housing.
I slid a piece of copper tubing through the mount hole and ran the clutch
tube through it.

Anyone else ever had this tube break or chaffe through?

I guess i could get it welded but it seems ok.
