Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Wheel rivets

I've put new clips in on several occasions. I ended up making a tool to hold 
the clip and rivet on the wheel. I used a 3/8s by 1 inch piece of bar stock 
and notched it to clear the clip. Then I ground a dimple in it with a 
carbide burr. Then I just used a pair of vise grip panel clamps to hold it 
all down. I heated the rivet with a torch to make it smash a little easier. 
I can do one in a matter of minutes now.

The first time I did one I used a couple of c clamps and that method doesn't 
work very well, but it is doable.

&gt;
&gt;that is both easy and hard, first you need a rivet
&gt;anvil to mount in your vice, then you buy steel rivets
&gt;and basically hammer them in.  hard part being the
&gt;buying of a rivet anvil.
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone ever figured out how to rivet on a hub cap
&gt;clip, on a wide five
&gt;wheel? Tried yesterday, what a nightmare.
