&lt;&lt; I have a BN4 heater that I took off a '77 bus.  It is still in my basement 
because I really don't think I need it.

So, I got great air flow, notorious engine heat, air tight Westy, driving 
gloves, lap blanket (an airline blanket now), stock insulation at the 
firewall front panel, a Bra (Really keeps the cold off the front as I am 
driving) and still I get cold.

As any HVAC contractor will honestly tell you, a hot air heating system
is the cheapest and least efficient home heating system. Upgrades can
be made with insulation and sealing but are not usually &quot;stock&quot;, either
on a new house or your 20+ year old bus. The hottest heat I ever got
was on a '71 1600 with a three speed blower mounted in the spare
tire well and piped to the heat exchangers. This system constantly
recirculated the interior air thru the exchangers (the ducts on
the doghouse were capped and the engine fan was just for engine
cooling). The heating tube under the bus was wrapped with adhesive
foam insulation and wire tied to make sure it stayed in place. 
The factory knew the limitations of the stock system but offered
the auxiliary heaters as a price plus option rather than improve the
system from the one that worked on the much smaller Bug interior.
