&gt; &gt;After 6 starters from a local FLAPS, all only lasting between one and 12
&gt; &gt;my 78 Westy (fiasco) is now equiped with a new bosch starter and no more

&gt; Gail and list:

&gt; I just installed my new engine this past weekend, and I put in a new high-torque gear-reduction starter that you see advertised in the VW magazines.  It's shaped differently than the Bosch starters, but seems to work fine.  It makes a neat kind of whirring, gear-like noise when it turns.  Has anyone used one of these before, and would like to comment on longevity?

I work in the transit industry and those buses (big ones) all have air
starters. which make a very high pitched whirring sound when operating, I
have often thought I would like an air starter.

of course then I need an air pump and storage tank and regulators etc etc 

oh well
