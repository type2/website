&gt; As one who has spent too much time in retail, yes
&gt; same kind only I did 
&gt; motorcycles and boats, the only time people are
&gt; happy is when things are 
&gt; cheap and fast. Hmm if I remember stats, these two
&gt; are mutually exclusive!

Peter Eagan recently wrote about restorations and how they were like
food. One can have good and cheap, but it won't be fast. You can get
good and fast, but it certainly won't come cheap. You can't have all
three. Since I don't have a lot of money, I guess I'll settle for good
and cheap.
