for the rebuild itself my trusty local shadetree mechanic sean charged me
$400 labor...the brakes, tierods and ball joints $165 labor.

add to this a set of michellin mx light truck reinforced tires at about
$74 (this is off the top of my head) with labor and lifetime balance etc
this total came to about $376.

i'm not even going to add in the oil temp, pressure, and voltometer
gauges and acessories because i'm getting rather depressed now.

i guess i've put in about $3,100.00 for the rebuilt engine, front end,
ires, gauges, tools, and other nifty acessories.

i'm flat broke now but the van runs great and i can't say how much
a difference the new front end and tires make. i've got power, stability
and great handling.

there are a number of reasons i didn't do the rebuild myslef. no space
to do it, no tools (i splurged and bought lots of tools though so i'm
equipped now in the case of emergency), i work 7 days a week basically,
i don't have alot of time, and i didn't think i was up to the task.

next time i will do it myself. especially if i get the splitty i'm
looking for. i can't believe i'm considering buying another van when
i've just dropped a fortune. when i get married we are getting a place
with a garage! for my workshop. i've learned alot along the way and i'm
learning as much as i can.

but i don't regret having sean do it. it was done right. it was done
well. and it will last a long time.
