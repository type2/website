It has been a week now since the serious hunt for a replacement for the
wrecked '69 began. I have been trolling the internet looking for a split
screen passenger bus that I can afford, is in acceptable condition and is
within 500 miles of me. I have come across a few sites where there are lots
of buses but I am wondering if I am overlooking other ones. So far  I am
trolling:
 
http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/classifieds/classifieds_main.htm and Everett has
put together a really great site BTW:)
http://home.graphics.uwaterloo_dot_ca/vwbuysell/ a type_dot_com joint(hmm will that
get filtered?)
http://www.traderonline_dot_com/coll/search/index.shtml blah blah blah
http://www.classifieds2000_dot_com/cgi-cls/display.exe?partner=c2k&amp;path=Auto~Van
~Search
http://ep_dot_com/ep/sub.html?cat=1158000 this one has a nice layout
various local and regional newspapers but I will spare you the details

Would anyone like to add to this list?
