Hi Rae,

You do not need a torque wrench to adjust the valves.  Feel how tight the
lock nuts are when you remove them and snug em up the same.  Keep the
pushrods and rockers in order to return them to the same locations.  When
installing the tubes with new seals, watch carefully to insure they do not
ride up and not seal.  It has happened to me, waa, waa.

Keep smiling,

Mike


&gt;  My question is do I need a
&gt; torque wrencch for this? I can't seem to find mine at the moment.
&gt; My bus is a '72 Westy with a carbed 1800.
