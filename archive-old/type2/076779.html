Subject: Re: [T2] 009 distributor? Why not?


&gt; I've checked the archives on this (try typing in 009, NOTHING comes
&gt; up). They didn't answer my question. I've been on this list long
&gt; enough to HEAR that you shouldn't put them on a BUS because the power
&gt; curve (or something like that) is all wrong, but I have never seen
&gt; any tests and data on it.

That is strange that the archives don't return anything on a search for 009,
I don't have an explanation for it--however, if you enter more cogent search
terms such as &quot;bosch distributor advance curve&quot; I think you will be happier
with the results you get.

I didn't try a search for &quot;centrifugal stumble&quot;, that might bear fruit too.

[Flame bait to the effect that if it weren't a good thing to do then there
wouldn't be a picture of it in _VW Trends_, has been removed by our
automated flame bait removal filter, and I'm glad, too, by cracky!]
