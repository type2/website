Subject: In need of interior parts ( special cargo door handle)

Hello List,

My friend has a 71 bus and is looking for a few parts
for it. He needs the inner cargo (sliding) door
handle. He said that the one he needs is NOT the kind
with the small square fitting but one with a fitting
that is &quot;oval with 4 splines&quot;. He also needs both
front door panels, the sliding door panel and the rear
hatch panel. He would prefer white but is open to
other colors. The door pannels that he wants have the
air duct with arm rest on them. If any one has any of
these parts, please let me know. He is still in school
and just needs economical yet functional parts that
look ok. The pannels don't have to be perfect but he
does not want ones that are rotton or deterorated.

Please let me know if you run across any of these.
