Subject: Celebrities in Buses

It's Friday, right?

This week I saw two celebrities on TV talking about their experiences in a
Bus.  The first was Jim Carrey.  He talked about how he and his dad
traveled the country in a Bus.  I guess his father was ridiculed by his own
family for doing so and not having a regular job instead.  The second was
singer/actress Taylor Dane who apparently has a Westy that she uses to go
camping in the mountains.  She sounded like a real enthusiast and a
definite candidate for the list!
