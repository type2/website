&gt; What imaginary about shore line?  A shore line is a line taken from the
&gt; stern of an anchored boat to a point on shore, usually in a crowded
&gt; anchorage, to prevent the boat from swinging and fouling other boats.  Also
&gt; called a stern line.  Around here, where yachting is very popular, I've
&gt; seen as many as 100 boats moored in a cove, each within 10 feet of his
&gt; neighbour, held by shore lines.

And what is imaginary about a skyhook? I've used them many times when I was
climbing.
