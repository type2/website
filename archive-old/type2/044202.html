&gt;
&gt;&gt; i was reinstalling my push rod tubes (72 westy, stock engine) and i 
stripped
&gt;&gt; one of the bolts that holds the rocker arm to the head, Bently lists it as
&gt;&gt; quality 6 G. Does this mean i cant go to a local hard ware store and buy a
&gt;&gt; new bolt? Do i have to go to the dealer?

You might also look for a &quot;Fastner Supply&quot; warehouse/dealer of some sort.  
They have everything, and even though they prefer to sell to retailers, they 
have stuff loose for walk-ins.
