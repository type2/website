Subject: Re: Where would you go in your VW? &lt;a friday question&gt;

&gt;Since planning is at least 10% of the fun of a trip, I would find out how
&gt;much I would need to spend, save money, rebuild the major components
&gt;(engine/transaxle), etc., get the location of parts suppliers along the 
&gt;route, and then do it.  

Do we have any Funkengruvin members among us?  How comprehensive is the book
you get with membership of VW repair/parts places around the US?  Is it
worth joining to get this?

&gt;plan for the worst.  The image of cruising at 60, glasspack growling,
&gt;bouncing over rutted roads in the central American jungle, knowing there
&gt;is six thousand miles to go raises goosebumps.  

Sounds great, I'm ready to go now! [insert jpeg here of me carelessly
throwing caution to the wind]
