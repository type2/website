ALERT  (Paul R...  Wash DC)   Some discount chain
store in the USA is selling a package deal;
hydraulic JACK PLUS two JACK STANDS...

&quot;SO WHAT&quot; you say!!!

The JACK STANDS have a max height of 21 INCHES,
and are 3 ton capacity
each.

&quot;SO WHAT&quot; you say again...

The JACK is a 2.5 ton speedy lift, and the lift is
21 INCHES&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;  With just
two strokes of the handle, the JACK goes from 6&quot;
to almost 19&quot;!!! 

The net weight of the JACK is listed at 44
pounds.  Heavy?? No, not for the
capacity of the JACK!!

This JACK is designed for the SUV vehicles which
are so high off the
ground. 

  By good fortune, the JACK and the JACK STANDS,
at 21&quot;, are ideal for the high  off the ground
Type 2 vehicles.

I just bought a set yesterday on the way home,
after talking to another
list member about the best JACK to buy for his
vehicle (Paul R.)  I was going to pay the basic
price for just the JACK, but when I found that
there was a 
package deal at the price of just the single JACK,
I was elated.  (I would 
have been 'exztatic', but I don't have spell check
on this machine!!)

The price??  Just $39.95 plus Virginia sales
tax!!  For all 3!!!

Where, you ask???   WAL*MART!!!
