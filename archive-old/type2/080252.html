Subject: Re: [T2] '78 bus 


&gt;   When my engine grenaded (dropped valve) on the freeway,
&gt;   I heard no unusual noises...

Driving my '64 Beetle, I dropped a valve at 65 mph downhill 
in a rainstorm at midnight on the Fourth of July.  Really
terrific metal noises somewhat overshadowed by a 540 degree
right hand spiral into the wall.  Coasted it the rest of the
way down the hill with the clutch down -- no shifting out of
fourth that time.  Kept the piston, which almost entirely
separated at ring #2, as a memento, and rebuilt the engine,
my first.
