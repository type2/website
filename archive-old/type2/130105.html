Subject: Re: [T2] Continental Vanco-8 tires

Hi Corbett,

I would suggest to go by the values in the bus manual, because the tire 
co. knows NOTHING about the suspension design of the vehicle. If the 
max weight rating of the tire meets the bus spec then you'll be fine.

Happy trails,

&gt; So how can we know exactly what PSI to put in our tire or should we go 
&gt; entirely by the manual. I figured that the tire company would know 
&gt; best, but they just list a max psi. How does the old owners manual 
&gt; know the type of tire that we have. I just put Vanco's on my bus this 
&gt; week and the place the mounted them put them all the way up to 65 psi. 
&gt; What do I need to lower them to?
