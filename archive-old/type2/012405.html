Subject: rust free used doors?
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Hello list!

Well I must say, I FEEL STUPID! I have sent two long
letters to an address that I thought was the list. I
lost both of them so I will try to remember everything
that I wrote.

I would like to thank all of you that replied to my
question about rebuilt heads and engine rebuild kits.
I will probably go with the Avp pistons/ cyllinder kit
and the AVP rebuilt heads. 

I am a senior in high school and have been working on
the body of my 1973 transporter for the last six
months. because of little money and time, it is taking
me awhile. 

Ok, ok, I'll get to the point. My two front doors are
in bad need of repair or replacement. One door does
not look that bad from the outside but the bottom
underside has holes in it big enough to stick my fist
through. I want to either buy two RUST FREE used
doors. 

(((QUESTION))))

Does any one know of any reputable dealer that could
sell me a used RUST FREE passenger and driver door for
a 1973 transporter and ship them to me at a reasonable
price? I am currently gathering funds so I will need
them sometime in the near future. Thanks for all your
help!

Have a great day!

David from Wilmington,NC
