Subject: Listee sticker update

Hey guys,

Well, I am just about  ready to print the stickers up.  I have placed the 
artwork file on thesamba_dot_com gallery.  It's listed under 'listee sticker'.

I like the way they turned out...so i hope you guys feel the same.  

If everyone like this one...I will begin working on a similar Baywindow bus 
sticker.

I'll keep you guys updated.
