Subject: bergs case thoughts quoted from his books

the increased torque is used on all cases.  it was developed (the
increase by 5 lbs on the six main case studs) to limit case wear, and
increased bearing life ON DAILY DRIVER MOTORS!!

this in not done solely on race motors, the torque on those would blow
your mind!!

i quote from bergs book:
&quot;i personally, have never had ANY problem using the factory stock case
for many hi-performance engines.  i have many (86mm stoke) running
daily after 150,000 miles or more with well over 3 times the original
HP and race engines producing 275 real dyno HP for over 10 yrs of
racing.  Before you think you need an aftermarket case for your high
perf. street engine maybe you should BE SURE YOU HAVE QUALITY PARTS,
that do not damage the case rather than find a case that resists
damage casued by poor quality parts or combinations.  poor quality
crankshafts are by far the largest cause of case failure.&quot;  from page
134 

more will come on his increase in torque changes.

bye for now.
