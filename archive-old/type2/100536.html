Subject: Stranded - Bad Starter? THANKS!

Hi Folks,

Sorry to be so late in replying, but I have not had access to my E-mail for 
the past week.  I just got online today to a full mailbox - and lots of 
great responses to my question.

It appears that the problem was a stuck solenoid as a result of the cold.  
After trying all of the remedies I mentioned, I called AAA to have them tow 
me up to the top of my parents' driveway.  After waiting for them for about 
an hour, I figured I'd try the Bus again, and it started!  The temperature 
had risen above freezing and the Bus had been sitting in the sun, so it 
seems that the warming was enough to un-stick whatever was stuck.

Anyway, thanks for all of the responses.  It's comforting to know I can turn 
to The List to help me out of a jam...


Take care,
Jason Upper
