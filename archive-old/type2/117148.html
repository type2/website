Subject: Oil temp senders and rear window defoggers

Okay so I am the clown who asked you guys if you really used the rear
window defogger on your bus because I NEVER need mine here in Northern VA.
Well yesterday on the way to Annapolis the heavens opened up and punished
me. I got stuck driving in the mother of all thunderstorms. There was a
foot and a half of standing water on the road and my bus got really foggy
inside. So I had no choice but turn on the defrost for the windshield which
meant using the heat. It was pretty much a sauna in there. Thank god for my
bilgeblower install because sitting in traffic did not give me the rpms to
defrost the windshield alone. So now the windshield is fog free and I'm hot
as hell, I look back and say hmmm why not test the rear window defogger?
Pulled the switch and enjoyed the green glow. No luck defogging though. So
now I guess will be diagnosing that. IIRC there are no breaks in the grid
so I will check voltage.
  Onto the next interesting observation. I run a VDO oil temp gauge with
the sump mounted sender. A while back there was some discussion about the
different readings from a dipstick sender and the sump sender. Possible
heat dissipation from air blowing by the sender was mentioned as well. Well
when I was sitting in traffic for (1.5hrs) my oil temps got up to just
under 210 before the rain really started in. Once the heavy stuff came down
and I was slowly driving in 9-12 inches of water at times the temp just
plummeted. Went down to just below 180. I am guessing that this much water
must have had a dramatic cooling effect on either the case or the sender or
both. Does that make my 78' a wasserboxer?

Thank God Its Friday, I'm only working till noon and I'm racing in a big
regatta this weekend with my beautiful wife. Life is good.
