&gt;Subject: I did it!

&gt;I turned my passenger side seat around and all is clean and fine.  The
&gt;Mothership looks as if it is the size of a room at the local Motel 6 1/2.

&gt;thanks for the instructions.

&gt;They saw the first miracle Christ performed on earth.

Sorry, couldn't resist, it's Friday after all, and anyway you asked for it.: )
Actually it's 1:30am on Friday and I've just reinstalled the front beam,
front brake system, tie rods, shock absorbers........been at it since
9am yesterday morning........now I'm gonna put together a 12 ton
hydraulic press so I can get those bearing races out of the front drums.

 .....be on the road in no time.
