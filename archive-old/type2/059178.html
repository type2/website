It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. In a fit of insanity I
had sold by bus and was going to the show to find another as other deals had
fallen through. Left Cincy at 6:00 AM with my wife in tow (this was the
first show she has ever gone to with me) and made it to the show site in
about 5 1/2 hours. Beautiful journey even though it was raining.
Got to the show site and the sun had come out and turned the day beautiful.
Started walking around, running into listees all over the place, and then I
saw IT. A beautiful, perfect, unrestored 1967 Westy, perfect interior,no
rust anywhere, and only 78,000 miles. The original 1500 still had the
governor on it. Time to test drive this puppy.
The owner,his buddy, and my wife piled in and off we went. I had been at the
show for about 1 1/2 hrs. at this point. Off we go and this baby dirves
nice, handles well (for a stock splitty), engine runs smooth, no
rattles,and, as its a walk through, the seats are even comfortable. We drive
down winding roads for about 10 miles and I'm sold.
At this time I am on a two-lane road with a double solid yellow line. I stop
to turn into a drive, look behind me and didn't see anything, start to turn
and WHAM-a lady goes over the double yellow and hits the drivers door
forward. No one was hurt, the owner didn't have the right plates so the
owners just exchanged information. The damage wasn't that great but I sure
felt terrible, even though it wasn't my fault.
The rest of the show was great even though my wife wasn't in the greatest
mood. Saw plenty of good looking busses, saw a lot of old friends from the
list and met some new ones. If I wasn't so bad at names and if senility
hadn't set in, I would mention everyone I met. It is great to meet new list
members and see the old ones again. This really feels like a friendly
home-town.
Well, as this was the last show I will be going to this year, I' already
looking forward to next year. C-ya all-TBear
