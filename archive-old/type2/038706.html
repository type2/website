&gt; The Germans designed them that way, and I don't think that
&gt; we can improve on their design.

The germans used various rubber bits to seal the doghhouse exhaust tinware
together... 1 that i have seen parhaps more.  Of all the tinware i have
found, only 1 set in my posession had this little seal. On the other
tinware i have done i used RTV to seal up the gap that the germans used
rubber for.

I suppoose you could try to source this seal, but it'd probably cost you
a few bucks if you could even find it.  $0.001 worth of RTV will do the
job too.

I'll bet you a donut your engine doesnt have this area sealed as the
germans designed...

take care,

Steve
