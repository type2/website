Terrible clunking coming from the rear???

Wow, this was X-ZACTLY what I experienced.  Terrible clunking from the rear.

Well, it was a loosened FRONT spare tire MOUNT that was causing the noise!!


Usually, I have someone outside the van to listen for the sounds, if
possible.  Or have them ride in the van to at least get an idea on which
side the noise comes from.  If they can't make a convincing determination, I
look to the center of the van for the noise.
