I believe that 1981 was the first year of the Jetta in the U.S....at Parts
Place, we have several customers that have put well over 300,000 miles
on their diesels.... with proper engine care and a little TLC these car will
run forever... Sure you may have to replace the head or head gasket
once or twice, but once you do it'll be worth atleast another 100,000...

&gt;miles, repairs done...? Is the Jetta a good sturdy vehicle? Asking price
on
&gt;this (&quot;it's a '70-something&quot;) is $1500...

Hello Ruthie, what do you mean by &quot;it's a '70-something&quot;??
Jetta's weren't introduced until the early '80's. 

Is it a turbo diesel? that's always a plus... the diesels seem to run
forever.
I had a '81 Rabbit diesel and It had around 230k mi. when I sold it. (hd.
gskts. replaced once.)
