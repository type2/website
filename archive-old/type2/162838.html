Subject: octane ratings

	I too have had to use higher-octane
petrol than I'd expected.  My motor must have
been modified by some PO ...  it is faster, but
at the price of more expensive fuel.  I've
modified a note I wrote for sickle racers.

	In NZ we have had to pay closer attention
to 'octane ratings' because Mobil &amp; Bechtel
foisted on us a synfuels factory which made from
natural gas peculiarly poor petrol (and is now
mothballed).
	Octane ratings are measured on a
single-cyl engine, at hundreds rather than
thousands of rpm.  The lower-revs test protocol
gives the Research Octane Rating, RON  -  which
for some unknown reason is what the oil corps
quote in NZ.  The higher-revs (if I recall, 300
rpm) test gives the Motor Octane Rating, MON.  A
given petrol typically turns out to have MON
approx 10 points below RON.  Your number on the
pump in N. Amer. is the average of these two
measurements:  (MON + RON) / 2.
	 Detonation, as distinct from the proper
mode of combustion (called 'deflagration'), is
audible at low revs as 'pinking' or 'knocking',
but if it occurs at high revs it is inaudible.
Detonation can create minute bits of plasma.
Plasma, 'the 4th state of matter', results from
stripping all the electrons off the atoms of a
gas.  Commercial tools to cut metals by a torch
of plasma have been commercially available for
over a decade.  We are talking hevi-doodi
erosivity here.
	Ignition timing is of course crucial to
minimising this risk.  But even when you've
ensured your spark timing is as you wish, you can
still get ultra-rapid overheating, produced in
spots by detonation.  The mechanism for this to
burn holes in pistons is thought to include the
creation of midget plasmas, usually in the top
ring groove.  Glowing deposits of 'coke' may act
as centres for a rapid blowup of temperature to
form plasma which melts through a piston.
	This has been most studied in S. Africa,
where hundreds of holed pistons were researched
by  Dr David Nates ex-Sasol who gave a good
seminar soon after arriving here.  He has a
collection of 400 pistons with holes melted thru
them by high-speed preignition NOT  GENERALLY
AUDIBLE. He pointed the finger at the synthetic
petrol made from coal at Sasolburg, which turns
out to be far less knock-resistant (i.e. have a
lower octane rating) at high revs, in a way not
detected by the 300-rpm octane-rating test
engine.  The same defect is reliably reported for
the synthetic &quot;91-octane&quot; petrol made by the
Mobil/Bechtel plant at Motunui 1983-96, which was
never sold as such but always mixed in at the
refinery with petrol made from oil.
	Fuel-improvers such as methanol can help
prevent this catastrophic detonation.  M10 (i.e.
10% methanol in petrol) is good; but note that
methanol is not miscible with petrol in all
proportions, and the maximum (around 15%) varies
with the temperature, how much water has snuck in
dissolved in the methanol, and what oil (if any)
you then mix in that fuel e.g thru crankcase
breather in a motor with plenty blow-by.  A
separate layer can settle out, which can cause
serious trouble, if you try for anything much
above M15.  (There is another class of fuel, M85
and up, researched at the U of Canterbury and
looking promising; but between M15 and M85 there
exists no single-phase mixture.)	 E10 &amp;
E15 are widely sold in the USA (owing to
billion-dollar subsidies to ADM etc  -  but
that's a side-track).  It is quite possible that
you'd find a given 'octane rating' in the form of
E15 runs better in your VW than a straight petrol
of the same octane rating.
	A good precaution is keeping the
combustion chamber, and especially the top ring
groove, free of 'coke' deposits which when
incandescent can act as glow-plugs and pre-ignite
the charge into wild detonation.
	For low-maintenance motors which may
accumulate coke, you may as well research the
possible utility of a fuel additive which is sold
for the different purpose of slowing wear in
valve seats:  Valvemaster..  I gather this is
similar or identical to the old Shell 'ICA  -
ignition control additive', a phosphorus compound
which is capable of 'fire-proofing' carbon
deposits.  If so, this could be worth a try.
	And of course, as you'd expect, I finish
by claiming that when we work out how to do
water-injection on the VW Solex, we can
cheerfully use the lowest-octane fuel on the
market, without knocking.
