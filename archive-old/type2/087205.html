Subject: Re: [T2] POR-15 questions

Matt,

You can put por-15 anyplace that does *not* already have grease or paint.

Go back and read the faq at their site.  

Lot's of rust flakes is no good, shiny new metal like a &quot;key&quot; is no 
good....

Por-15 &quot;wants&quot; something with &quot;tooth&quot; to stick to.
And it better be clean...as in no salt or dirt residue left on it....that 
is why the push their &quot;metal ready&quot; and &quot;marine clean&quot; type stuff.


Cheers, dave
