Hi,
This is my first time posting on the list.  I just bought my first vw, wh=
ich is also my first car.  It is a 79 Westfalia.  I bought it from out of=
 state.  Now the only problem is I live in CA and have to pass smog.  I d=
on't have a lot of experience with cars.  I have read the Bently, Haynes,=
 and Muir manuals.  I have a small selection of tools and am willing to d=
o the work.  I enjoy doing the work.  I am willing to buy more tools if p=
ractical and necessary.  My problem is I don't know where to start.  I ha=
ve very little money and don't want to start investing it in parts that d=
on't need to be fixed.  =20
The bus runs.  The body and interior are in pretty nice shape.  I have fi=
xed the speedo, t/s switch, and horn.  Now I'm getting into the nitty gri=
tty work.
The exhaust was entering the cab until I removed the bellowed tubes under=
neath.  There is a small oil leak also.  I have found oil on the concrete=
 where it is parked.  However the leak is minimal.  In the month+ that I =
have owned the bus it has not noticeably effected the oil level.  The exh=
aust is pretty strong, so I don't think it will pass smog without some wo=
rk.
One person told me I just needed a new valve cover gasket.  Another told =
me I needed new heater boxes.  Another person told me it probably had to =
do with the fuel injection.      =20
Can anyone help me figure out where to start?
Also, can any one recommend a cheap mechanic in the CA bay area, or anyon=
e who knows more about vws than I do and wants to make some cash.  I live=
 near Palo Alto (in the south bay).  Also, can anyone recommend a cheap p=
arts distributor, new or used.)
Thanks,
Kyle
