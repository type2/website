Subject: Re: speakers into kick panels

(Pics available on request)
For a better sound and a higher location than the kick panel sides,
consider the nice wells just medial (towards the center) of the light
buckets.  Holds 6.5&quot; 3-way 100 watt speakers.  I used bolts through the
kick panels which were thickened with masonite where the speaker mounts
are.  To keep the washer tank, I heated it up and squished it enough to
fit in the space just left of the right door.  A new fill hole was
added, the old one was lost into the speaker cutout. Added an electric
pump also to bypass the steering wheel valve. The kick panels were
reinstalled with extra screws to keep them from buzzing, and fiberglass
was stuffed around the speakers.  
   As my daughter likes techno music, I scrounged a 10&quot; subwoofer and
amp from a parter and custom made a box that lets it aim down about 2.5&quot;
above the floor between the front middle seats.  The box is from 3/4&quot;
countertop
lifted from a kitchen installer dumpster; looks nifty as a &quot;tray&quot; and
has cup holders mounted to the front.  It is spaced by 4 lag bolts that
are adusted to let the box sit level.  The box is about 9&quot; x 13&quot; X 16&quot;
and has fiberfill stuffed into it as this small for a 10&quot; speaker.  I
added 2 diagonal braces, and it is all held together by glue and 1&quot;
spaced 2&quot; air driven finish nails.  Sounds nice and tight.
