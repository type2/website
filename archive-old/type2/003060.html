&quot;dear list, I am currently trying to get my '79 Westfalia up and running.
It was running like a champ last winter, then upon my return from a 3 month
work project the bus having sat for 3 months, the engine is leaking oil.
20,000 miles on rebuild.&quot;

Other possibilities that come to mind
- if oil leaks with engine running: Oil pressure sender, oil cooler itself
(did you pressure test it?), oil filter/gasket, then of course valve
covers/pushrod tube seals (these are farther forward, but hot oil sure can
migrate with a good 60 knot breeze blowing by underneath the engine), the
pressed-in plugs which block the end of the oil galleys on the left rear of
the engine, one for the mains and one for the cam bearings, obvious by
following the tubular bulge in the case which comes from the oil pump upward
and to the left).
- if leak shows up a few minutes after shutting the engine off: There is a
drilling in the case which connects the oil pickup pipe to the oil pump.
This drilling starts at the oil pump and goes downward and to the right. At
the bottom of this passage, perpendicular to the long axis of the engine, is
another press-fitted plug. Since this is a supply passage for the pump, the
oil in it is not under pressure. It is being SUCKED toward the pump and
would therefore be under negative pressure... When the engine stops turning,
the oil pump stops too and the oil which is in this passage wants to flow
back down hill to the crankcase. If the aforementioned plug is loose in its
bore, oil will leak here for several minutes, until the passage is empty.
The loss is on the order of a couple ounces at most.

In either case, the best bet is to pressure wash or steam clean the while
area and run to isolate. If it's one of the plugs, you'll have to take the
fan housing back off to do the repair, which can be a ticklish business. We
like to remove the bad plug, tap the hole with a pipe-thread tap and install
a threaded plug, using JB Weld liberally as needed. Best of luck!
