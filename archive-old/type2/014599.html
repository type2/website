Hiya List,

I've got a problem with exhaust gasses in the cabin of my 70 Bus.  Not much, 
mind you, but definitely there.  Enough to give me a slight headache after a 
half hour run.  My question is this..............  how are these gasses 
getting into the cabin?  The heating vents are closed.  I checked the flaps 
in the heater boxes, they are definitely closed.  The engine is way back 
there and I am spending most of my time moving forward so that should move 
the exhaust gasses to the rear and away from the Bus, right? (Obviously wrong 
in my case)  Somebody set me straight.
Some other information for context..........  The engine compartment is not 
airtight with respect to the underside of the engine.  There is a rust hole 
under the battery plate and the rubber seal above the cylinders on the right 
side is a seal in name only.  There is a one inch hole under the right 
taillight (PO had a trailer connection there) and the rear hatch does not 
perfectly seal (although it looks like a pretty good seal to me) the engine 
compartment due to collision damage.  The heater boxes have been removed and 
cleaned and reinstalled with new hardware and gaskets.  They do seem to have 
a large opening (I compare them to the heater boxes on my 70 Bug) at the rear 
where the J-tube meets the muffler.
Finally, I installed a new exhaust system (a Bug system with dual tailpipes). 
 The exhaust seemed to be present before the new exhaust.  It was definitely 
worse when the heater was on with the old exhaust system.  I'm thinking of 
removing the new muffler and reinstalling with a liberal dose of muffler 
cement where the muffler attaches to the J-tubes (under the clamps) just in 
case the fumes are somehow working their way back up through the heater boxes 
and into the cabin (although that looks impossible due to the closed flaps).
Any ideas out there?  I know I should seal off the engine compartment from 
the underside and I'll do that soon.  But how the heck are the gasses getting 
into the cabin?  In the meantime, the Bus stays parked.

Thanks!

Mike
