Does anyone know of a source for the small clips and seals that the early
loafs used to attach the door panels with. No supplier that I checked with
seemed to have them. It was suggested that I drill out the holes to use the
big clips and seals. Please-please someone tell me of another alternative as
I hate drilling anything on my bus. As always, your advice and wisdom are
appreciated highly. TIA

Also, I am planning on running a wire directly from the battery to a small
fuse box under the dash from which I will run accessories. I would like to
put a relay in the circuit so that the fuse panel is active only when the
ignition switch is on. Being the biggest electrical idiot in the world can
someone tell me what size relay to use to activate the circuit. I hope I
have made myself clear and , if not, I would appreciate it if any one of the
electrical gurus would pmail me as I am trying to save bandwith( actually I
just don't want to show how really electrically dumb I am)

As always, TIA TBear

Don't take life too seriously--you'll never live through it.
