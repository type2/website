Subject: Re: Insulation Material. under floor

Your best bet it to make a &quot;sandwich&quot; out of 1/2&quot; foamboard and a thin
1/8&quot; layer of ply on top of that, which you can paint or glue on a layer
of linoleum.  If you want the carpet look, you could glue it right to
the board.  The best insulation value is isocyanurate foam, but doubt
you can get it thinner than 1&quot; - blueboard can be had thin enough; it's
basically styrofoam and is used under siding.  Get the kind with foil on
one side; glue that has hydrocarbons could eat (dissolve) styrofoam.
