Subject: Synchronizing carbs

I just got a Unisyn for synchronizing my dual Solexes. 

(NOTE: I got mine at CB Performance -- $19.95 on their web site. Best
price I found.)

The directions are kinda sketchy. I'm assuming, since David Schwarze was
the last person to adjust my carbs, that step 4, &quot;Adjust idle mixture
screws to factory specifications,&quot; is taken care of. The rest of it just
makes my brain glaze over. Can anyone out there demystify this process
so I don't feel like I'm going to waste an afternoon totally screwing up
my bus?

TIA,

Nikki
