Subject: Sad Day in my VWland!!

     I just wanted to let you know we lost a great VW mechanic, and my
best friend, Frank Grumbien, last night. He was the greatest mechanic I
know, He worked on vw's since they came out. Been at the same location
for over 40 years. He built the motor for my first car, a superbeetle,
and the motor in my bus. He was my teacher, my mentor, and my friend, He
taught me everything I know on my vw's, but I only wish I could learn
more from him. He got up every day and came to work from 9 to 5 at the
age of 80 when he passed away, I only can dream of doing all that he has
done at that age. I will miss him deeply.

Thanks for listening, I just have to keep remembering the good things,
like this list.

Thanks,
Shawn Reed
