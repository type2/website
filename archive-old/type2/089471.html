Subject: Re: [T2] Gas Hog

My 82 westy only got about 12 mpg when i first got it.  I get about 15 
mpg now.  that is just under what the orig vw rating was when new.  The 
westy is a heavier vehicle than the standard buses.  However yours does 
seem to be quite low.  my personal opinion is that an 009 dizzy doesnt 
belong on a heavy vehicle.  Vacuum advanced dizzy would respond better 
to the power curves of a loaded vehicle.

&gt; My 71 Westy, new to me is getting around 10 mpg.
&gt; All the other buses have had (4) did 20 or better.
&gt; It has just been tune &amp; runs strong the thing that comes to mind is 
&gt; that it has the .09 distributor but could it be that bad.
&gt;
&gt; The old suburban I drove did better than this.
&gt;
&gt; Hope you can help.

&gt; Thank you,
