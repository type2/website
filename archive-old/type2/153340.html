      Annealing


  Annealing is a process wherein heat is applied to a metal in order to 
change it's internal structure in such a way that the metal will become 
softer.

     Most of us think of &quot;heat treating&quot; when we think of applying heat to a 
metal in order to change it's internal structural properties. The word &quot;heat 
treating&quot; is most commonly associated with steel. However, the term heat 
treating is not annealing, except in a general and journalistic sense of the 
word. Heat treating refers to a process wherein the metal is made harder. 
Annealing always means to make the metal softer.

     In order to make steel harder, it is heated to some temperature, and 
then cooled fairly rapidly, although this is not always the case. Brass, on 
the other hand, cannot be made harder by heating it -- ever -- brass is 
always made softer by heating.

     The only way brass can be made harder is to &quot;work&quot; it. That is, the 
brass must be bent, hammered, shaped or otherwise formed. Once it has been 
made hard, it can be returned to it's &quot;soft&quot; state by annealing. The 
hardness of brass can be controlled by annealing for a specified time and 
temperature.

     Unlike steel, which will be made harder when it is cooled rapidly, 
brass is virtually unaffected when it is rapidly cooled. Annealing brass and 
suddenly quenching it in water will have no measurable effect on the brass. 
Cartridge cases are made of brass. When cartridge cases have been reloaded a 
number of times, the case necks become harder. Annealing will return the 
cartridge case necks to their factory original state.

=============================================
 If you quench it you are not annealing it, by definition, and I don't think 
you could get brass shell casings to the critical point with a common 
propane torch. Maybe you're tempering them. =^ ) I could be wrong.
