&gt; This is the location where the m plate should be BUT to read it is another
&gt; thing, since the place is dark and almost with out space unless you take the
&gt; dash panel out (not recommended) I suggest to you to find a piece of carbon
&gt; paper (the one used so many years ago to makes more than one copy on a type
&gt; writer machine) place it upside down over the m plate, then place a piece of
&gt; paper over an rubbed with something flat to get a print of the m plate ( you
&gt; can also use a credit card Boucher to do the trick).

Or use a small mirror to take a photo and invert the image for readability.
