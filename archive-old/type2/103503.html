&gt;good place to have hoses redone locally. Monday, I am

&gt;difficult?

Not really.  A bit cumbersome - would be a lot easier with a 2nd person.

&gt;I noticed that the belt seems to
&gt;be located in front (front means front) of the of the
&gt;fan shroud. Is this a special shroud? Will I have to
&gt;modify my shroud?

It is not a special shroud, but you will need the pulley that goes in front (FIF) of the fan.  Make sure you remove the fan and take this pulley if you are going to use the York compressor.  It replaces a spacer in non-AC applications.  Also take the belt if it is still there (not likely).

Bring a large crescent wrench to disconnect the hoses at the evaporator (or an exacto knife to cut the hoses).  Be very careful removing the fittings.  If you have a large phillips screwdriver, bring that too.  Don't try and remove the plastic cover from the evaporator assembly - it is riveted on in several places.  You only need remove the 4-6 large phillips-head sheet metal screws from the sides of the assembly and a couple of small ones at the front near the sun visors and the whole unit will drop down.
