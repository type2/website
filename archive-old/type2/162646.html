&gt; OK, here goes...

&gt; I want to go to a junk yard and cut parts out of a donor VW bus (RBC).  I
&gt; figured I could take a Diehard Portable Power 950 with 18AH and run a line
&gt; from the DC outlet on the Portable Power 950 to a 1000W power inverter
&gt; (1000W = how many amps??  About 8-amps???) and then to a 4-amp 4 1/2&quot;
&gt; grinder with a metal cutoff wheel.

why not just use a  batttery operated Sawzall.  they are cheaper and
easier to use than the hook up you planned.  not to mention the fact that
you could recharge the battery right from the bus lighter socket if needed
