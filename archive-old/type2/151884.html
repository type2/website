Billy,

Bummer man....

The witness is your ace in the hole.

yeah, expired plates(barely or otherwise) get no respect.

Hope you are ok.

Meet with your insurance folks asap...in *person*....


Cheers, dave

&gt; Impact knocks me over the yellow lines and off the road up onto the grass on

&gt; 
&gt; CA plates with 'barely' expired tags gets no love from the cop.
&gt; 
&gt; Guy seems cool, but later reports a claim to my insurance saying he had right
&gt; of way.
&gt; Insurances will likely deny each other's claims, and I have liability only so
&gt; I'm a$$ out.
&gt; 
&gt; I have a witness, but the cop didn't put him in the report because he left me
&gt; his phone number before the cop got there.
&gt; 
&gt; Thoughts?
