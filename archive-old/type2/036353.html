Subject: pierced nose cone?

i'm preparing the '71 transaxle for insertion to the '68.
i created a place to clean the transaxle by
drilling a hole in a piece of plywood resting on an
old tire.
with teh pilot shaft in the hole, and the bellhousing
on the plywood, i began to dig off clods of funk from
the underside. while moving around to the dorsal side of the 
nose cone, i noticed a fluid leaking quite rapidly
out of a small hole which appeared to be machined [clean,
precise hole, not appearing to be a puncture]. 

teh hole was located on the mounting flange to the right 
of the centermost stud/nut. slightly off center [towards
the nut] of a moulding seam.

this fluid was slightly antifreeze in color with the 
apearance and flow of new synthetic oil [i admit to not pursuing
a more thourough method of identification, perhaps a taste test]. 

is this some sort of casting retaining pin defect that has been 
here all the while,and only now hass been noticed?
or some sort of pressure relief?
someone please tell me that hole is *supposed* to be there - sure. 

i'm going to have to replace the nose cone, aren't i?
well, if that's the case, then can i use the nose cone off
the '68 tranny?
