Subject: 68 disk brake conversion/ powertrain upgrade Q's

Heya Volks,
  Onlist here again after many years lurking over at vintage. Great 
resource, much thanks all around.
I now have a 68 westy (w/euro pop) and she's bringing out the darkside 
in me. Her 1600 is fine now, but probably gonna do a transvair 
eventually as I have access to a good 110 core. As I understand it a T4 
won't fit with my &quot;68 only&quot; engine support without structural mods. 
Fact or Myth? Anyone familiar with this issue?
  Also, I figure disks up front B4 even thinking about boosting HP. I am 
wondering if there is an easy disk conversion, or do I need to replace 
the whole front beam? Failing that, any word on a brake booster for 
this year?
Any help or advice is appreciated.
regards
shin
