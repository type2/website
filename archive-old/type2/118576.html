Subject: [T2] Subject: Kerry drove a VW and MASSACRED WOMEN AND CHILDREN
  in the 60's

A small correction is in order here...

Senator John Kerry, the current front runner in the democratic primary, was
a regular navy guy who was involved in action with the riverine branch of
the US navy in 'Nam (and I think destroyers too). While I'm not a huge fan
of his post-military behavior, his navy service appears to have been pretty
routine for the times.

Senator Bob Kerry, who ran in a democratic primary about ten years ago, was
a navy SEAL. As one might expect, he was involved in some very serious
special warfare operations, including what was alleged to have been a
massacre of civilians. Eyewitness accounts vary, even within the team
community. This became public knowledge a couple years ago, pretty much
derailing any future political career for Bob.

Like I said, I'm not a fan, but I think John did his duty in the 'Nam
without massacring any non-combatants.
