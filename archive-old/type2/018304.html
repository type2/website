I can't speak to Woosung tyres, but three or four years ago I bought a set of
Kumho tyres (another Korean brand).  At the time, I'd never heard of the brand
and was a bit leary of &quot;off-brands&quot;.  But money was tight, and I needed the
reinforced tyres now!!!  These were the only ones locally available in 185-14.
 So...  I gave 'em a try.

Bottom line...  They've got about 60k on them and still have about 70% tread
depth.  Of course, YMMV. If the price is right, go for it!
