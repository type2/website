Not sure if a factory option.  Just bought a '79 with a/c.  Really dont
think it is factory, because the unit is located above your head when
seated in it.  Not on the roof.  It is inside the cabin.  Just the evap,
fan and switch's.  Compresser is in the engine compartment.  No belt so
it does not actually work.  That will be remided though.  I would like
to know more if anyone else more info.
