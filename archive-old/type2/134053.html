&gt;Just wondering why the Type II list is always twice as long as the Vintage

&gt;The Vintage owners can keep the Splitties running without much help ?

&gt;Or are there just fewer Splitties around ?
&gt;
&gt;Or ?


As far as I can see, all the splitty folk hightailed it to the samba 
forums. a shame, since i have no time to waste digging thru flame 
wars and bitch slapping.
also, since the T2 listees seem to use their busses as daily drivers 
more than the VB listees do, they are more prone to write in-depth 
procedures, etc. here, i've been told &quot;we're beyond the wrenching 
phase; we're into completing collector cars correctly&quot; and &quot;it's all 
in the archives.&quot;

truly sad, as this list  used to be AWESOME, and I can't tell you how 
much i learned from it, and how many people i considered an 
electronic friend.
VB isn't the only one to go thru a slack period (the sun ra list used 
to be a major research souce; now it is reduced to 'which sun ra 
track is funkiest?'), and hopefully it will come back... esp when i 
get my single cab back from storage in a few years!
