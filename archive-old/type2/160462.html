&gt;Just curious. What's considered stock now-a-days?

Bentley shows Bosch W 145 T2. The current designation by Bosch is 
W8CC. The long number is 0 241 229 579. The 0 in the long number 
means, Made In Germany. Stock gap is 0.024 inch, 0.60 mm.

&gt;My points are gone for a pertronix.

Not stock of course. If you are using stock coil or the Bosch Blue 
coil replacement and no aftermarket CDI, use stock gap. If you are 
using CDI, follow manufacturer's recommendation.

&gt;The 1700 fi is mated to a 74 auto tranny (should be carbs)
&gt;914 heads..

Holy sheet, hold on while I check to see what Porsche calls for on 
those heads..............
Bosch W 175 T2, which is a colder plug than the 145 for the VW 
heads/ignition probably due to higher compression and leaner running with FI.

If I was you, I would use the W7CC's and monitor electrode wear and 
color. Any evidence of carbon fouling, then go to the warmer plug, IE 
W8CC and monitor for evidence of heat stress, re: rapid wear, running 
on, or just too hot for summer temps. Porsche also calls for 0.028 
gap, but if you are running VW stock compression with VW coil, I 
would use the VW gap. I expect the Porsche ignition was designed for 
a bit higher secondary volts for higher compression than the VW. If 
whomever assembled that motor did not check deck height, chamber 
volumes, whether the heads had ever been cut, and made an adjustment 
for CR, and documented same, then your actual CR is unknown.

With the non-stock mismash of parts you got going there, finding the 
best heat range will be trial and error. That's why I always advise, 
STOCK IST BESTE, if you want the no guess solution to perfect 
function with easy maintenance via factory given specs and procedures.
