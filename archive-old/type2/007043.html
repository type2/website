The problem:

Driving home late tonight, bus completely dies, lights go out, electrical
burning smell.
Everything comes back a few seconds later, seems fine except lights are ver
dim at idle, but brighten up when revving engine.
Generator light behaves normally, ie idiot light works the way it should.
All battery connections fine, etc.

check all your wires.  do you know where the smell came from?  Get a
flashlight and look under the dash at the wires.  This was in the 56, right?
 Fuses?
