Subject: [T2] VW calenders
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Hello all,
  Last year some kind sole went to his local VW dealer and obtained some
caenders. He then offered them to the list for the cost of shipping only. I
do not know who that was, so I called the dealer and found out that they
will send them to you. They are asking for a suggested donation of $2 for
Hartsland Fund (?)or something like that. These calenders have VW Buses (and
Bugs) on them and would cost at least $4-6 at Wal-Mart. I know nothing of
the charity, you will will have to ask them about that. Their info is:
Jack Scoville Ltd.
900 NW Fourth St.
Corvallis, OR 97330
(541)-753-1694

Do not respond to me, I have nothing to do with the dealer or the charity. I
just think the calenders are real cool and the price is right. You don't
find many calenders these days with Buses on them.
