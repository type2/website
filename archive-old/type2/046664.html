Subject: [T2] lookin for thule racks

Hello list members,
    I was looking into getting a pair of Thule roof racks for my bus.
This is because I want to be able to carry a one man outrigger canoe on
top of my bus.  Wow these are expensive!  Anyone want to recommend a
place to buy them or a another brand?  Much appreciated.

Mahalo
Greg
