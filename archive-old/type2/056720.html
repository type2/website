Subject: 82 Aircooled Westie: Clutch vs Tranny Busted?

Hello all. Just got back from a 4000 mile roadtrip to Maine in my 1982
Aircooled Westie. On the way back, things started to go wrong:

several times while running at 60 - 70 MPH in 4th gear the vehicle would
buck for a few times... if you have ever had a car run out of gas... this
is what it felt like. Although, if I depressed the clutch I could rev the
engine. This would happen on uphill inclines mostly and was associated with
bumps in the road. 

the frequency of this phenomenon increased throughout the return trip... it
was really starting to worry me. 

tward the very end of the trip, I had to stop for gas. I depressed the
clutch and applied the brakes to slow down... no problem. But afterward,
the shifter was stuck in 4th gear... I eventually got goining by
accelerating the vehicle in bursts...rev...let out clutch... rev...let out
clutch. Once I got the car going the 4th gear would disengage.. but now,
the 3rd and 4th gears were like speed shifting all the time. 1st and second
would engage normally. But third and fourth would engage with a clunk and a
grind. 

this behavior has persisted and I'm wondering if the problem is:

1)in my attempt to get the shifter out of 4th gear I dislodged the Berg
shifter plate and thus have misaligned the shifter.

2)the jerking motion was a symptom of a slipping clutch and the clutch is
in the process of going bad

3) the Tranny has gone bad.. perhaps the shifter synchro has worn out.


So, what do you think?
