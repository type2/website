&gt; &gt; &gt;Where's that deer? I'd like to give it a whack too.
&gt; &gt; ======================&gt;
&gt; &gt; what was the name of that insurance company???
&gt; My question also!  
&gt; 
&gt; I wish I could get my '71 insured for between 3 and 5 thousand dollars;
&gt; just to cover getting a van in like mechanical condition if someone
&gt; crunches it.  We have liability, but nothing other than that. Our
&gt; insurance agent sez that it is not possible;  You either get comp-- you
&gt; 
&gt; Is it possible to insure an auto of our's age for a fixed amount of
&gt; money?  If so, who does so?

I've got mine covered by Maryland Casualty and it has full coverage, when
I got creamed by the truck a couple years ago (hit and run) they tried to
total it out, but I used comparable cost etc, and they covered the full
repairs, over $2,000
