Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch Pedal Travel Question

No, shouldn't be a problem.  The clutch mechanicals
can travel that far.

Frequent clutch cable failures at the clutch actuating
arm could be caused by electrolytic-induced
corrosion...if your tranny-frame grounding strap is
missing, frayed, or corroded the clutch cable might
end up as the next-best conduction path for the ground
to the engine! The resulting current can cause rapid
corrosion. 



&lt;SNIP&gt;
This is something I've always wondered.. If the clutch
fully engages
before the pedal hits the floor, but you keep going,
is there a risk
of damage?


I'd always been taught to always floor the clutch
pedal to preserve
the clutch disc (keep it from wearing out).
