&gt;Can a dizzy for a 77 FI 2000 work on a 73 1800 single carb?  (I have a

&gt;Where would the vac. adv. source come from for the 1800?

You must compare the advance curves for the stock and donor distributors by
part no. All the data is in the Bentley. If they match within 2 or 3° in
all respects, mechanical/vacuum advance/retard and total range, that's
going to work just fine. Vacuum advance comes from the port at the throttle
plate in the venturi. Vacuum retard, if you use it, hooks up to mainfold
vacuum below the venturi. Know that the initial timing is very different
with vacuum retard as the range is extended 8° or so. 3 to 4° initial BTDC
without retard hookup, 4 to 6° ATDC with vacumm retard hooked up. Verify
original spec for your 1800 and set up the proper replacement distributor
accordingly, even if you have the single carb conversion.
