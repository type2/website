Subject: Dux 50's windup singlecab pictures

I bought myself a new singlecab yesterday!
It is a Dux windup and I bought it from a Swedish toy guy named Carl.

It is sort of strange, I think that it is a barndoor era, pre-55 by the cab 
top.
But the gates do not drop &amp; it looks like it was a bus toy with the top cut 
off, and a cab added.
It is a windup &amp; I need the key, there is a three position lever/switch in 
the back and a square key underneath. The front wheels are also pointable, 
not steerable.
Has anyone seen a Dux toy before?
Here is the link

I also bought a new piggybank/bus coin bank 
It is RHD from England as can be seem from the side door painting!
