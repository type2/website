Subject: How to replace bushing in steering relay lever
References: &lt;F702U8QVjp3b6uIU1Gj0001c7d2_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

Hi with the high milage never rebuilt 78 Westy......
With 226,000 mi on my steering (original bearings still rolling), I'm
getting enough up and down play in the relay lever to throw the wheels
when going over bumps due to the transferred loosness to the tie rods.
Is it a DIY project to replace the bushing in the relay lever housing,
or is this a professional job?  I'm thinking of the difficulty in
popping off the relay lever, and whether driving the old bushing 
downwards will be a problem, since so little room is present from above-
Bentley shows a slide hammer with a special impact driver- how can this
be jury rigged?
   No one answered on how to check for play in tie rods using ordinary
tools BTW.
