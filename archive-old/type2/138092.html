Subject: Throttle Adjustment

As I recall you let the valve close completely and then attach the cable with minimum
slack. The BIG screw next to the throttle valve is the idle speed. 

Throw that stinkin' Haynes away. 'tis JUNK! 

Buy the Bentley and be happy. 

Adjusting it the way you did will give you a varying idle speed based on the accelerator
cable (engine speed, temp, condition of the motor mounts...). On the dozens of cars
I have worked on the cable is never the idle speed adjustment, it is always a mechanical
stop - be it a screw against a stop, or an EFI motor, a bypass screw often.
