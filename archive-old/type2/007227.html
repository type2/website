Hi All,

will fit in my
'72 Bus ? This '73 Camper also has jalousie windows will they fit in the same
spot where my vented windows were?

	I Have a Campmobile, manufactured 6/73 which has low back seats, the ones
with the squared off tops. I've also thought about changing seats; as the SO
has a high comfort tolerance. I will admit these seats have seen better days,
including a dye job by a DPO. What do y'all think; are these seats original?
What years used the same mounting scheme? I've read here previously that
Vanagon seats sit high, which is not an option. Hmmm bus or relationship;
relationship or bus, somehow I don't think I'm the first to mull this
conundrum.
	On a lighter note, our fellow listee who referred to Jealousy Windows was not
so far off base:

  		Main Entry: jal/ou/sie
 		 Pronunciation: 'ja-l&amp;-sE
  		Function: noun
		Etymology: French, literally, jealousy, from Old French jelous jealous
		Date: 1766
		1 : a blind with adjustable horizontal slats for admitting light and air
while excluding direct sun and rain
		2 : a window made of adjustable glass louvers that control ventilation

and from Random House Unabridged : &quot;from Italian; Gelosia, so called because
such blinds afford a view while hiding the viewer.&quot; As for the 82' (eighty-two
foot busses) I'm keeping my eyes peeled.

Why, oh why do people do the things they do?
