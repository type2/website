Subject: Re: Who just painted their pop top?

Ruth Bajorek asked about how I painted the 76 Westy pop top, using a roller 
and brush.

THE PAINT: I refinished my Westy poptop with Pettit EasyPoxy single 
component polyurethane topside paint, #3108 Off-White. $30/quart at 
WalMart, Marine Department. It went on the poptop  smoothly, easily, and 
looked good when it was dry (which was about an hour to the touch, and 
about a day until it was no longer off-gassing.)

THE PROCESS: I cleaned the top on day one, let it dry overnight, and then 
masked the vehicle outside on the following morning, about 10AM. I ate 
lunch and then applied the paint in early afternoon. By about 5PM the job 
was done and the vehicle remained parked for two days with the pop top raised.

DETAILS: I sent a longer version to Ruth, and would be glad to do the same 
for anyone requesting.

If I were doing it over, I might apply a sandable primer first, and after 
it was dry I would sand down the short nappy fiberglass stubble that 
remained after the scrubbing. But I can still get rid of that problem by 
sanding the top coat, only it is harder than the primer would have been. 
Frankly, it looks so good that I probably won't do anything more to it. But 
that is a personal opinion. The texture isn't show-car perfect, but that is 
OK with me.

Hope this is helpful.
