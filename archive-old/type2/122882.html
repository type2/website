Subject: 091 in an early bay--trim input shaft?

Esteemed list:

I am about to pick up a used 091 from the local trike/rail guru.  He has
swapped the bell housing and front mount so I can put it in my '70 Westy.

Is it true that the input shaft needs to be trimmed? And if so, by how much
exactly?

Also, I am ashamed to say that I made it only about 10 miles on a recycle
run with rebuilt 041 heads and Dellorto DRLA 36's on an 1835cc.  I limped
home and now a few days later, looked under my valve covers.  There appears
to be something holding #2 exhaust valve open approx. 4 mm.  either that or
it is seized in its guide, or something else horrific has happened.  Might
have sucked in a piece of debris or (gasp!) a loose nut or something?!? (yes
I have air filters on there) Would anyone admit to having this happen
before?  Hopefully 4 mm doesn't put it through the piston? (Deck height
approx. 0.150&quot;)  Next weekend I will be stripping it down again, sigh.  It
did run very strong for 8 of those 10 miles, scant consolation though.

TIA,
