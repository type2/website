&gt;&gt;Dear Mr. Hoover:
&gt;&gt;I've read your articles on veedubes with great interest because   I'm
&gt;&gt;overhauling an '81 &gt;2000cc Vanagon engine and I want to do it 
&gt;&gt;correctly. Your articles are great! I noticed &gt;your article about 
&gt;&gt;engine paint and can't find a good medium temperature paint in dull 
&gt;&gt;black. An auto paint store has Vulux brand 2 part paint in gloss black 
&gt;&gt;that is good to &gt;about 300 to 350 F. What brand and type of paint do 
&gt;&gt;you use on the case and cylinders? Please give me a &gt;shout.
&gt;&gt;Thank you,
&gt;&gt;Phil

&gt;&gt;Phil,

&gt;The Rustoleum Flat Black paint I use on Type I/III crankcases, which 
&gt;are of magnesium alloy, is not suitable for use on the Type IV 
&gt;crankcase, which is an aluminum alloy.

&lt;snip&gt;

I painted my newly-rebuilt Type IV engine, block, cylinders, heads &amp; all 
with Rustoleum semi-gloss black, diluted about half-and-half with naptha 
or paint thinner, I don't remember which.

After almost a year's driving, the paint's still in fine shape (I used 2 
or 3 light coats).  Seems to work fine for me.

Roy
