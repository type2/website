Subject: RE: [T2] '78 Windshield Seal

&gt;From: &quot;Sage Green&quot; &lt;
&gt;I just had my windshield on my 78 Westy replaced in Virginia.  Heres what 
&gt;they charged my insurance company; Windshield $178.35, labor - $40, and 
&gt;weather-strip (seal) - $62.15.
&gt;The windshield seal is from a company named Precision Replacement Parts 
&gt;Corp, Part No WBL 210, Model Weather-strip W/O Tri, Description EE6A  
&gt;39-8193, Made in Thailand.


Does that seal come with a Thai dinner? I love Thai food.

No wonder why Insurance is so high.

Good luck with the new one, I have a front replacement due, just waiting for 
time.

&quot;just waiting for time&quot; is that an oxymoron?
