Hey Steve,

I am quick to jump to conclusions. I didn't see the
part of the add saying that they DID roll it on a test
drive. They obviously aren't as good in driving a bus
as they are in restoring one. Your explination is a
good one. I don't like the way they presented the bus
on Ebay. If you went by those pictures alone, you
would be deceived in to beliving that there was only
that one caved in area to fix. That looked pretty
sleezy to me. Any way, nice observaiton. Have a great
day!

&gt; I think it rolled to the right into a ditch, causing
&gt; the damage on the right
&gt; side, bounced, preserving the roof and hit the other
&gt; side of the ditch on
&gt; the left side.
&gt; 
&gt; How about that for a theory?

&gt; &gt; I bet I know what happened to this bus. I would be
&gt; &gt; willing to bet that this bus fell off the shop
&gt; lift at
&gt; &gt; the place where it was being restored. At first I
&gt; &gt; thought that someone had rolled it but If it had
&gt; been,
&gt; &gt; most of the windows would have been smashed and
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; entire roof warped.
