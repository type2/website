Subject: Re:'71 intermittent problem

Craig,
    You said ...&quot; intermittently sputters and dies (as if it were
running out of gas) while freeway driving&quot;...

    I had the same thing happen to our '71.  It turned out to be the
fuel screen that is screwed into the outlet of the fuel tank.  A new
screen, and seals, only costs a few dollars.  I would suggest you
change it, or at least clean the old one.
