Subject: clutch swap

I have a 74 bus with the 210mm clutch, 1800cc engine and 
an 002 trans. What all would I have to get to change over to the 
228mm clutch. I know I would need the disk, P. plate, 
flywheel, but would I have to change the starter or the 
bell housing? If so, how are they different?
