&gt; Hello all, I'm thinking that before I send my &quot;old&quot; bus off to the boneyard
&gt; I'd 
&gt; like to pull off the tie rods, which have less than 1,000 miles on them and
&gt; exchange them for the ones on my &quot;new&quot; bus, which are of unknown age. In the
&gt; Bentley section on front end, it shows a tie rod seperator being used. Is this
&gt; a special vw specific tool, or can I rent one from my local autozone?

Mike,

No puller you can rent from Autozone will remove them easily and all will
waste your time (trust me, I tried in vain one afternoon renting all of
their tools). They are all claw shaped instead unlike the VW tool which of
has a C-cup at the end and won't damage the rubber grease boot. The VW tools
also has a round end screw which won't damage the threads or the stud.

A real VW tie-rod tool is a worthwhile one to own. It will pop tie-rods in
10 seconds without damage and it also pulls the draglink form the pitman
arm:

It's ACC-C10-7081 at California Imports, PEL-TOL-P211 at Pelican Parts,
BugPack catalog item #7080.

Samstag sales sells one from Hazet &lt;http://www.samstagsales_dot_com/hazet.htm&gt;
and so does Zelenda in the VW/Adui catalog &lt;http://www.zelenda_dot_com/&gt; but I
would go with CIP1.
