Subject: Re: [T2] Wiper blades size - 68 bus

16 Inch (Bosch 40 716), VW 211 955 425 E

The right side end will usually NOT contact the glass due to the curvature
of the windshield.  It's a common thing (at least it was on my 69, 73 and
77).  You could run a 15 or 14 inch blade on the right side, but you will
reduce coverage on the right side of the glass by doing so

&gt; Hello all...
&gt; Can someone tell me what is the correct size for the wiper blades for a 68
&gt; bus?
&gt; 15 inches? 16 inches?....
&gt; I had 16 inches blades on my Bus, but i remenber that at least one of the
&gt; tips
&gt; was not in contact with the glass....was it because they were too long, or
&gt; was
&gt; it a wiper arm problem?
