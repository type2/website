Subject: RE: [T2] $$$ and Quality

&gt; I just installed a new rear cargo hatch seal from Bus Depot.
&gt;
&gt; Since the rubber in NewBus was original, before I installed the
&gt; replacement, I made a very detailed comparison of the removed
&gt; original to the Bus Depot replacement as to cut, design, mould
&gt; shape, etc... right down to a very deep minutia of examination
&gt;
&gt; .......Result of inspection ... ......... The rubbers are identical.
&gt; I am happy to know that this critical sealing piece has not been
&gt; design compromised or metamorphosed over the years.


Bob,
Thank you so much for taking the time to post your positive review!  It
really made my day to see that our efforts are appreciated. So many people
only bother to compose an email when they have something to gripe about.
