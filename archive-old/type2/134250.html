Subject: to install thermostat? yes - no - maybe

Dismantilling a 1.7 type 2 and am wondering how effective the thermostat will
be later on when it gets full of gunk and such. Help me on the principle of
the thermostat. When cold is it contracted ,which keeps flaps closed, then as
it warms up it expands which opens air flaps. Is this correct? Seems that if
Bus is used only during warm weather it could be used with thermostat
disconnected? Thanks Michael
