Subject: Re: [T2] expansion tank question

For safety's sake you should probably change all the rubber seals,
including the grommets on top of the tank and the filler neck grommet.
The first time dropping the tank it takes a little longer as you are
looking at it and trying to figure it out. I had mine out so many
times it got to being a very short job. While you have it out, you
might check the valley under the heat duct. Dirt collect there and
invites rust to form, so you need to verify the integrity of the tank
there. Now you know why I had mine in and out so many times! I got a
replacement tank from CIP1 for a hundred or so.

 My 81 Vanagon is coming along nicely.  However, I've inspected the
hoses that go from the fuel tank to the two expansion tanks, and they
are in bad shape.  I would like to replace them.

 Can I do it without dropping the gas tank?  Is dropping the gas tank
as scary as I think it is, if I have to drop it?
