&gt; Q2:  Confirm Bosch quality is declining.


What is going out of tune?  If it's timing/dwell, then I'd suspect the
distributor cam isn't as smooth as it should be.  Keep in mind that even
the best NOS Bosch points will wear out rapidly if they are forced to rub
against a rough cam  It might be a good idea to polish the distributor cam
with some 600 grit emery cloth to smooth it out and then lube with good
thick Bosch distributor grease.

BTW, Bruck &lt;&gt; Bosch.

Bosch had a run of bad points, IIRC.  I'm not all that picky about points
and seem to have good luck with point wear, with both sets of points I'm
currently running sitting stable in timing and dwell for a very long time.
