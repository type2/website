Subject: Re: No Stupid Questions

I had a Math Teacher once who said,&quot;There are no stupid questions, only 
stupid people. And they don't ask questions....&quot;  so ask on, Dave, and a 
bunch of us will get educated right along with you. I've owned, driven, and 
worked on my bus for twelve years, and I find out something new every day on 
this list. I've had an opportunity to provide information that may have 
[don't know for sure] helped a young lady stuck in Mexico with a busted 
Westy. I've learned that the 009 dizzy is probably NOT the right one for my 
bus, despite all the hype I've been exposed to for years. Wish I'd'a known 
that before I bought one. I've learned stuff about carbs, transmissions, 
tires, cv joints,engine makers,  and the list goes on...[wasn't trying to 
make a pun there, but it's appropriate ]  I think this List is great, and I'm 
glad I found it. So ask on.
