Subject: This Christmas

  I sit here and wonder why my heart fells so heavy.  Of late, I too 
have been irritable and easily swayed into a complacent apathetic 
attitude.

My life is good, my finances are better, and smiles occur more 
frequently than frowns these days.  My travels are over, and the 
product of the experience is still edifying itself each day in 
greater amounts of patience, lesser amounts of indecision, and almost 
no feelings of desperation.  The times have certainly brought 
positive change.  I actually live in a house now, and have for months.

The Miracle Mothership is running good and she is still my daily 
driver and sole transportational aircooled unit.  I slept in her this 
past weekend for the first time in roughly 4 months.  I snoozed like 
a babe in swaddling clothing,  Ok...Ok....A &quot;baby Huey&quot; in a quilt on 
a narrow bed! :)  There is just something about that bus that is 
good, just as there is something about your bus, that is also &quot;good&quot;.

My heart is heavy I think because I am not seeing the true meaning of 
Christmas yet.  I know what it should be, but I am not seeing the 
motive for the season portrayed as openly as I feel it could by 
others around me.  I have faith it is happening, but I am blind to 
it.  I don't like that of me but I cannot begin to know what to do to 
cure it.

Is it anxieties tied with Y2K and it's mystery that is sending me on 
this roller coaster of emotional soul searching?  Is it the fact that 
I am trying to start a small business and doing so with only minimal 
growth and success?  Things never seem to move fast enough for me. 
Mystery does not suit me, I like to be able to plan without much 
surprise.

Each year I spend Christmas day alone.  If not the whole day, a good 
portion of it.  I have purposely done this the past few years so as 
to remind me to dwell on the things I need to dwell on every now and 
then.  Matters of finance have their share of my time, as does 
matters of romance.  I think for balance one is required to also 
consider the spiritual, and give it it's share of review as well.

Christmas is the season we cherish as a reminder that we 'need one 
another'.  We show our appreciation by giving gifts, and wishing good 
tidings.  We sacrifice a tree, and dress it with boughs of holly and 
popcorn.  We shop till we drop, and then get up and go again seizing 
every sale and clearance we can think of in an effort to make our 
season bright.  And to brighten the season of the ones we love.

In this effort, steered most of the time by haste, we also defeat the 
&quot;reason&quot; the &quot;season&quot; exist.  As we are going through the motions of 
&quot;season brightening&quot;, we are simultaneously stifling the very product 
we seek to create within ourselves.  Why?....Simply because it is the 
traditional thing to do, even though it brings stress with it.

I challenge you this Christmas to take the time to pause and think 
about the true meaning of this, our most endeared holiday.  It is the 
one that stands to teach us the most about our spirit, and the 
actions that grow from it.  It's not about Santa, or reindeer, or 
even three wisemen.  It is about teaching us to love and care for 
each other with an eye toward quality movement through this life.  We 
are our borther and sisters keeper.

We celebrate the birth of Christ on this day because his was the most 
amazing birth.  The philosophy of living that birth brought with it 
is also most amazing.  The example of sacrifice he set noble and 
resounding.  Even for his persecutors he had no ill spoken words 
therefore I believe forgiveness is also something this season fosters.

Whether you are a believer or not, this principle of living is a good 
and solid one to adopt.  Caring for someone and putting action to 
that care is good and perpetuates a better life for all.  Living 
peaceful and good is not about Catholic, Baptist, or any other 
religious system.  It is only about doing the right thing.

Peace on earth and goodwill toward men.  This is something that is 
NOT seasonal, nor is it just a trivial matter to be considered once a 
year.  It is the legacy I believe wise men seek.  It is the 
foundation of living good and whole.  It is the greatest thing one 
can promote in their life's walk.  Let's commit ourselves to making 
it a year-round way of living.

I will try to be more patient and helpful in the coming year.  The 
only gift I can give to all of you is myself and some of my time.  I 
hope that it is a worthy enough gift for now.  I will constantly 
strive to give more in the future.

Peace folks, I love you all.  If ya need me holler!

Thanks for tolerating the ramblings,

Charlie Ford
