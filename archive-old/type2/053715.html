&lt;&lt; My second question is about installing a cigarette lighter, I have heard 
it 
 is relatively easy and was wondering if someone could give me some 
 tips/instructions
 T &gt;&gt;

1.  decide where you will install it.   As I am not a big fan of cutting 
holes in dash,  and I found a radio block off plate that already had a hole 
cut in it, I installed it in the radio block off plate.  If you already have 
holes cut in the dash, fill one.

2.  I like the kind that has the light. 

3.   hook up the light to the dash light terminal on the headlight switch- 
the one with the rheostat so you can dim it with the other dash lights.  

4.  I would hook up the power so it can always work.   you can check this on 
your fuse box with a test light and turning the key on and off.   make sure 
you hook it up on the fused side of the fuse box- IE light does not work with 
fuse removed.

Hope this helps
