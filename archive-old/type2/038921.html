Nikki,

I suffer from a similar affliction...  I don't look at
the glass as being half-full, nor do I see it as
half-empty....I just worry about my ability to refill
it before it's empty!!! ;-)

Many people who know me, think I'm a pessimist, but I
disagree. I'd simply rather prepare for an emergency,
than be caught short.

My thinking is this...if I prepare for the worst, and
it happens, well...I'm prepared. I'm not happy that
the event occurred, but at least I was ready for it.

If I prepare for the worst, and it *doesn't* happen,
well...I'm happier still!

I figure that I'm pragmatic, and that's not a bad
thing.

&gt; I have this theory that if I'm thoroughly prepared
&gt; for a disaster, said
&gt; disaster will not happen. It's not a fool-proof
&gt; theory, but it works
&gt; more times than not.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, I know many will tell me why having metal bars
&gt; on my front bumper
&gt; will be useless in the event that another kamikaze
&gt; deer steps into my
&gt; path one of these nights. Even halogen lights
&gt; mounted on the front
&gt; bumper won't help if Bambi decides to just drop in
&gt; front of my bus at
&gt; the moment of impact, like that one in Texas.
&gt; 
&gt; BUT! I'll feel better having the bars, lights, spare
&gt; tire, etc., on the
&gt; front of my bus -- the reverse mojo factor. No deer
&gt; will dare cross my
&gt; path, cuz I'm ready for 'em! I'm also not worried
&gt; about having bars
&gt; attached to my front bumper bending the frame cuz I
&gt; won't be hitting
&gt; anything, see?
&gt; 
&gt; I *do* draw the line at deer whistles, George -- I'm
&gt; not a total nimrod. :-)
