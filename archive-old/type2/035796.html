SNIP--Can you say &quot;Bilstein&quot;??? They come with a lifetime warrenty that
you will
---never need, the only kind of warrenty worth anything 'cause their
specs far
---exceed the second best wannabees. SNIP

I have to agree - I used Bilsteins on a VW dasher that was autocrossed
(raced) and they have good control without too rough a ride - on that
vechicle.  This is after trashing a set of Koni's.  Yes the Koni's had a
lifetime warranty too, but what do you do?-leave your car on stands
waiting for the manufactuer's judgement? I had KYB's on a 84 GTI - Too
harsh for me, but they did wear quickly, softening the ride... and my
complaints.  Don;t know if it applies to busses &amp; Vanagons, but the gas
charged Bilsteins can be mounted upside down (and were on the rear on my
dasher) to reduce the unsprung weight.  A good thing on the rear axle of
of FWD car.
