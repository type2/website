Oops...just *read* what you wrote. Forget the vapor-lock nonsense.

Sounds like it could be the starter. I had a similar problem on a J**p and
bought several new starters only to find that the problem was something
else--noboy that I talked to could figure it out. My solution was to remove
the starter, sand down the face of the housing and reinstall. This fix was
good for about 500 miles or so. I got so that I could preform the operation in
less than 5 minutes. It was all superstition, but it was effective.

Try searching the archives for &quot;starter&quot; &quot;solenoid&quot; and &quot;10 gauge&quot;--you might
find what you're after.

Good luck.
