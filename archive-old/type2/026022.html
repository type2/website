Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Cleaning --heat riser tubes-- Intake Manifold

I've never tried it, but has anyone tried turning the manifold upside down
and pouring oven cleaner in it?  Then after setting a while, run the clutch
cable back through it.  Who knows, it might work.

&gt; The single port intake manifold we removed *from an engine were replacing
&gt; that was in a bus with 110,000 original miles on it*  was plugged up with
&gt; carbon where the heat riser tubes come together.
&gt; Tried running a piece of old clutch cable through that you attach to a high
&gt; speed air tool method.  What a PITA that was.  Finally broke down, and
&gt; bought a used manifold that was clear, from: www.interstatevw_dot_com  for big
&gt; $$$.
&gt; 
&gt; The question is: Does anyone know of a special reaming tool that  could be
&gt; purchase to do this that would be a little safer, and more efficient.
