Subject: Re: [T2] Windshield seal

I used it.  It doesn't appear to me to be any different in shape than my previous seal, which was from Bus Boys.  Like the Bus Boys seal, it &quot;sweats&quot; a bit of black off when I wash it but other than that seems to be holding up well.  No shrinkage after several years of Texas heat.

&gt;Has anyone used the Bus Depot Windshield seal? It's supposed to be 1/4-1/2&quot;
&gt;larger in thickness than the OE and other seals.
&gt;
&gt;I'm wondering if this helps with shrinkage and what it looks like when new?
