Subject: Re: [T2] Valve Adjustment question!

Hey Will,
There should be a mark on your distributor that is pointing back and
slightly to the right out of the hatch of your engine compartment door
.. at about this angle

|front of car|
|            |
|            |
|  dizzy     |
|      \     |
|            |
|back of car |

see that diagonal line underneath dizzy, that's about the angle that the
little line on the rim of the distrubutor should be pointing.  Spin your
alternator bolt until the rotor lines up with it and then you have TDC. 
Then go ahead and adjust cylinder one.  Then spin the engine so the
rotor turns counter-clockwise 90 degrees from that position, and you
have cylinder two, then three, then four.  Piece-o-cake :)

To remove the valve covers, a drum brake tool works WONDERS!

remove the spark plugs and it makes it easier to spin the engine, and
it's a good time to install new ones if you want...

later,
Mike

&gt; Hello:
&gt; 
&gt; I am fairly new to the VW world and am attempting my first valve adjustment
&gt; this weekend with the help of &quot;How to Keep Your VW Alive.&quot; However, I am
&gt; confused about one point in the process - TDC.  To get #1 to firing
&gt; position, do I simply line up the paint mark with the crankcase crack - and
&gt; that's it? The book mentions a file mark on the distributor rim, which mine
&gt; does not have. Also, do I use the paint mark on the left or the right (I
&gt; have three). I appreciate any help. Thanks.
