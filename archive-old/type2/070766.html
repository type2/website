&lt;&lt; and the motor was leaking quite a bit more than usual. The motor was 
 also putting out a blue cloud when I started it up in the morning 
 which for whatever reason coincided with the switch to 20-50w. When 
 the plugs came out the ones form the right side head were brown and 
 ones from the left side were grayish black. New Bosch plugs went in 
 and a fresh batch of Castrol 30w.
  &gt;&gt;
all four plugs should look the same, some thing is wrong.   I would do a 
compression test.  borrow a buy a guage.  

what's low? add oil to the low ones, test again, if they get 'better' bad 
rings.

look for blow by- leaks from between the cylinders/heads (black marks from 
soot there)

re torque heads?  maybe one side is coming loose

How's you gas milage?  I developed bad rings once, but didn't notice a power 
loss, but it drank a lot more gas.
