Thanks to everyone for their help!
 
 Of course the problem turned out to be operator error;-)   For the first time
ever I had installed the distributor and dist. drive while the case was split
(per the Tom Wilson book)   Although this method seemed very promising;
especially since it avoided any chance of the dreaded spacer-washer-dropped-
in-the case it didnt turn out for me...  Although to the best of my knowledge
I followed the directions in the book work for word I ended up with my dist.
drive out 45 degrees and you all know the hell that followed.  I am wondering
if perhaps the instructions for setting up the dist. drive in the Wilson book
is for type ones only??? (Mine is a Type 4)
 
 Anyway after returning to the ways of St. Muir my baby is purring like a
kitten and I couldnt be happier.  
 
 Thanks again!
