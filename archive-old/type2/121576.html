&gt;Does anyone know what air/fuel ratio a *stock* VW bus engine (2.0 liter,

The only stock adjustment is at idle. It is always done after the 
mechanicals and ignition are verified stock. For higher RPMS the correct 
mixture is controlled by the design of the FI system. If it is set stock at 
idle it will be in spec at all RPMs and loads.
