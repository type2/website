&lt;&lt; what about a water cooled vanagon that had a 2liter aircooled engine
transplanted into it???

From other lists...If you're planning any major changes to a vehicle
(16/4 Veyron engine into your 71 Westy...?-) keep a log with pic-
tures...Get &quot;ALL&quot; the appropriate manuals for the various bits...
If the engine is from another make, model, year, make sure you
have the right make, model, year manual...If you ever plan to try
to sell the vehicle, it's not gonna help if you tell a prospective
buyer the engine is from your uncle's Gogomobile and you think
it was a 55...If you used a &quot;kit&quot; from say, KEP, get all the paper-
work that came with the kit (make repros...) so any part that
might be needed in the future can be sourced...
Essentially, you're creating a sorta-kit car and a future owner
might wanna know that the sixteen 1 1/2 inch SU's you're using
on the Veyron aren't stock... ;-)
