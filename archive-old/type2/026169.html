Hate to rain on your parade but a more likely result will be lots of runs, a
flat looking finish due to holding the gun too far away, and a bunch of bugs
&amp; dirt in the paint.  And by the way, how do you propose to do 2 colors in
one day?  Know your equipment and materials (especially the materials)
before you tackle a complete paint job.  Experienced painters do not like to
spray paints they're not used to because of differences in coverage and
drying time.  Don't expect to pick it up in one day -- its not like spraying
primer.

And in response to the reply about fixing rust under the windshield, bondo
is not waterproof so your rust problem is likely to come back worse than
before because the bondo will actually trap water and let it sit next to the
metal.  I have found fiberglass resin to be much more long lasting.

&gt; 
&gt; Howdy Folks,
&gt; Tonight I attempt painting my new '66 camper.  I have NEVER painted a car
&gt; before, but then again there are lots of things I had previously never
&gt; done before owning 3 air-cooled VW's.  Plus I am an adventurous soul.
&gt; Anyway I have all the tools, respirator, paint gun, compressor, etc.  I am
&gt; looking for a good resource with information about car painting.  Either
&gt; someone who has done it themselves that can give me some tips or can
&gt; direct me to a good web site with some helpful tips for the first-timer.
&gt; Wish me luck, if all goes well, this time tomorrow I will have a two-tone
&gt; Mouse Gray\Pearl White decent-looking bus, instead of the flat gray primer
&gt; color it now is!
&gt;
