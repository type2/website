Subject: Re: [T2] alternator charging voltage?

Hey Mark

If I remember correctly you should get 13-13.5 volts at around 3k rpm. I
have also read that the faint glow can be resistance from old corroded wires
in the charging system. Don't know if that has anything to do with the
hesitation though.

Subject: [T2] alternator charging voltage?


&gt; The bus is a 79 with a stock alternator and what appears to be a fairly
&gt; standard, relay controled auxilary battery setup.
&gt;
&gt; What voltage reading should I get when I connect a voltmeter across the
&gt; battery terminals with the engine running at idle and at 3000rpm?
&gt;
&gt; I'm getting a faintly glowing alternator warning light (that I can see at
&gt; nigth) and a slight intermittent engine hesitation that has defied ALL
efforts at
&gt; troubleshooting it! I'm wondering if they might be related.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; thanks,
