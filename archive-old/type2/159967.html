Subject: Re: [T2] Idiot lights and other assorted questions

This is kind of what I was thinking the &quot;problem&quot; is.  I would think the
system shouldn't lose pressure that quickly but I figured I would ask the
experts since the light does seem to work just fine and comes on in the
first position if shes been sitting a while.

Anyone know how quickly the oil system should depressurize?

&gt; as far as the oil pressure the question is
&gt; is it the sensor or
&gt; does it actually still have pressure enough to trip the pressure switch
&gt; and how much is it.
&gt;
&gt; you can tee a mechanical pressure gauge in there to diagnose it.
