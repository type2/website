Subject: Tranny woes - followup report

Today I finally got the bus put back together.  Sure takes longer putting
together than it did taking apart.  Lots of little problems along the way,
and being as this is the first time I'd had the tranny out, there were a
lot of dirty parts to be cleaned.

The good news is that I couldn't find anything wrong with the clutch
assembly, even though it was acting funny before.  So I put all of the
used, inspected, freshly lubricated parts back on the engine for another
round of duty.

Problems with reassembly:

Turns out the 091 (76-79) transmission is about 1/4&quot; longer than the 002 it
replaced.  I used the bellhousing and front mount from the old
transmission.  First clue something was wrong was that the studs to hold
the front mount on were about 1/4&quot; shorter than on the old tranny.  I
ignored this because there were still enough threads for the fasteners to
attach.  Second clue was that it was very difficult to get the engine and
tranny to go far forward enough in the van so that the rear transmission
mount would line up.  I finally succeeded in getting the assembly
installed.  Third clue something was wrong was when I first drove the van
after the install - lots of vibrations coming through that weren't there
before.  Inspection revealed that the rear tranny mount was to blame.
There are two bolts that go through a &quot;carrier&quot; in the body.  The tranny
hangs from these bolts.  The carrier was obviously pushed rearward against
the frame.
My guess is that I need a later-model front transmission mount which will
allow the engine and tranny to come forward 1/4&quot; or so.  This should solve
the problem, but of course, I won't be able to find this part here in
Dallas, especially not before the trip out West later this week, so I guess
I have to live with the vibration for a while.

Rest of the assembly went fairly smoothly.  When I finally drove the van, I
was disappointed to find that 4th gear is much lower than it was before.
The bus used to turn 3850 RPM at 60 mph.  Now it turns 4000 rpm.  The first
three gears are approximately what they were before.  Knowing that 4th in
the new tranny is .88 (I measured it) it is obvious that, despite what the
manuals say, my old transmission had the .82 4th gear.  Now I am REALLY
hurting on the freeway.  Top speed is down to about 70 mph and I won't be
able to cruise over 60 for any length of time.  To top it off, the new
tranny is leaking fluid from the gearbox-bellhousing seal.  Looks like it
might only be while it's running.  I may have to fill it at rest stops on
the trip.  Jeez, I'm starting to sound like Bob Hoover!  :-)

The only good thing out of all this is that the bus is much quieter now
without the bad bearing in the old transmission.  But, with all of the
other problems, the net effect of this week of hell is negative, and it
cost me a lot of money and sweat to get here.  I'm having real bad feelings
about my bus at the moment, more than I have in a long time.  I hope my
luck will change soon.

I don't suppose anyone has the front mounting bracket from a 76-79
transmission lying around that they would be willing to Fed-Ex to me, would
they?  Didn't think so.
