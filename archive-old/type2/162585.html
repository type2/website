Subject: Re: [T2] EUREKA he finally shouts, was frustrated still, what
  have I done now...??)_at_$#$]  (fwd)

&gt; &gt; but of course I just want to be done 4 days I phutzed with this
&gt; &gt; thing I
&gt; &gt; have other stuff to do with my time off.



rummaged around in the garage and found a third &quot;AFM&quot; plug it in and lo
and behold it fires right up... just took a test drive and it runs about
as well as can be expected after twiddling with it for four days.  now to
retune it, and finish the cotton picking new sliding door I've been
working on for two months finally getting it ready to paint.... maybe this
weeek I will get it running right and have a sliding dooor that won't
fall off.

then if I have some time befoore I have to go back to work finish the LED
taillights  (the folks at JBB saw how nice they were)  will write it up
when finished.

thanks for all the help guys (and gals) couldn't have done it without you
Bob
