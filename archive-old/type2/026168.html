You're probably looking at the remains of the return spring.

&gt; 
&gt; I just fired up my newly acquired 79 Westy, and while reconnecting all the
&gt; emissions stuff the PO had undone, I noticed what appears to be a
&gt; springloaded &quot;bar&quot; that runs across the engine from side to side just on
&gt; the
&gt; rear of the distributor (rear as in rear of bus). It looks like it had a
&gt; wire going to it at some time, much like a throttle cable wire. It is
&gt; missing now, just a bit of it's end remains, and I can't figure where it
&gt; would have run too. Any ideas??
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Courtney
