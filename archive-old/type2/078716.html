&gt; &gt; I would like to put heat at least some heat in my 1971 camper.  My tubing is
&gt; &gt; shot and I am starting from scratch.  Any thoughts?
&gt; 
&gt; Dan, that depends on what you mean by &quot;shot&quot; and how far you are willing
&gt; to go.  The complete list of parts for an early bay window bus heat system
&gt; AFAIK is:
&gt; 
&gt; Part              Replacement/cure
&gt; 
&gt; Heater boxes.     on a '71, get bus heater boxes used or buy replacement
&gt;                   bug heater boxes and convert them or wire them open in
&gt;                   September and unwire in May.  The bus boxes are pretty
&gt;                   common at swap meets.
&gt; 
&gt; Flex tubes        Widely available new for bugs, cut them down to fit your
&gt;                   bus. (probably bus tubes are available, it's just too
&gt;                   easy to cut down the bug tubes :-)

get truck flex exhaust pipe

&gt; Y collector       welded into the body and NLA, as far as I know (but
&gt;                   check with VW)...  If they are not available from VW,
&gt;                   junkyard and torch to get it out and in.  A small
&gt;                   job for a body shop, but a *big* job! for the rest of

well I made one from truck exhaust pipe but a pretty good facsimile can be
gotten at any muffler shop.

&gt; Long tube         Kelly (metwiz) is making repro's for splits, don't see
&gt;                   why he could not make one for bays in sheet metal.
&gt;                   Othewise, junkyard.  I recommend *against* PVC... it
&gt;                   melts.  Maybe dryer duct.  See the archives, there ought
&gt;                   to be a million makeshifts there.

truck exhaust pipe, either flex or just a straight piece

&gt; air distributor   At the front, also welded in.  See Y collector above.

see Y collector

&gt; short tube        This varies by year and I don't know where it runs on
&gt;                   '68-71 buses, but it is a smaller diameter than the long
&gt;                   tube

back to the truck exhaust pipe
&gt; 
&gt; Elbow to cab      I have *never* seen one of these that was dead beyond
&gt;                   use, but if it is, another junkyard item to be welded
&gt;                   in.
&gt; 

I bought a 25ft roll of the flex pipe pretty close to the right size for a
little over $50 from a auto/truck parts wholesaler

&gt; I do know that if you get everything in, sealed and even a little
&gt; insulated, there is plenty of heat down to ~25.  Below that, gas heaters
&gt; get real nice to own.

gas heaters are real nice
