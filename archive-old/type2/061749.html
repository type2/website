       I didn't catch that one -- who was he and what did he say? (hmm, better
answer that off list, lest we transgress.

&gt; The funeral was a nice, as nice as they get anyway.  The flowers abounded
&gt; and the colors were happy.  There was one that was made in the VW Logo, and
&gt; others that were the more traditional look.  The casket was oak and looked
&gt; rich, as he deserved.

         I really want to have my own private funeral waaay up in the mountains
some place, and have the ravens and crows and chickadees eat my body.
Seriously. The Tibetan monks have what they call &quot;sky burial&quot;, and they carry
their dead on their backs up to the top, and cut up the body so the buzzards
that live up there can eat it quicker, then when the bones are picked clean,
they smash them with big mauls and mix them with the brains for a desert for
the buzzards. Pretty cool! But I have a greater affinity to the corvids, and no
trustworthy monks.
