Subject: Re: [T2] Petronix points feedback and a stupid coil question

&gt; seen have the coil upside down, (coil wire facing down). Mine is up
does this make a diff? Don't coils 
 have oil in them that could leak??? Sorry for the stupid question.
------------------
Not a stupid question. Most coils have some oil in them as a coolant. If
it leaks you should expect trouble.
Up or down doesn't make any difference as long as your terminal
connections are good. Coils are mounted facing down to avoid corrosion
that can settle in the primary connection.
