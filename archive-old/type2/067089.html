Subject: Re: Q: What kind of trailer hitch for my '72 camper

Check your dealer accessory books folks. Yes, there were trailer hitches ( class
1) offered by the dealer as an accessory.  I  own a trailer hitch w/
integregated ball that was made by Westfalia-werke exclusively for the '73-'79
buses. It has a built in plug for trailer lights. ( maybe it would fit a '72
also, but I dont have a '72 and I know the bumpers are different)
