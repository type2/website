tonight seems to be the night for heater questions
I've got an early BN4 (identified by Ron Van Ness's excellent article)
does anyone know what years got the early and what years got late?
fwiw the heater came out of a '72 (located thanks to Mark Hineline) and is
going into a '70 westy
tia
Chuck 
'70 westy
now street legal
