&gt; My '81 started making a very strange noise today.

Hi, I had the very same problem 2 weeks ago (on the International break down
with your VW at work day). At least that's what I conclude from the symptoms
you described. It went away after revving up the engine a bit and has not
(yet) come back. I asked the list and from the responses I got I think the
stuck lifter is the most likely candidate.
