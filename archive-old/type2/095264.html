Subject: She goes, she stops, she purrs like a kitten...

Hi all...

Finally got Mimi back on the road today -- and damn is she running good! 
(probably shouldn't say that too loud though)

What's got me pumped is not just the fact that she goes and stops, but that 
she's doing so at much lower decibels than before. The no-go situation was 
initially blamed on the throw-out bearing, but ended up being a bad drum. Of 
course, I had already gone through the trouble of installing a new clutch 
disk, plate and throw-out bearing. That was fun because my parts guy gave me 
the wrong clutch disk, causing me to have to pull the engine a total of 
three times in two days.

Replacing the drum was almost as much fun. After some delays with my local 
vendor on a new drum (and finally calling up Joe _at_ BustedBus -- thanks!), I 
was finally able to get to it this past weekend. Let's just say that thirty 
years of rust and paint on the lugnuts made things a little &quot;challenging&quot;. I 
snapped two heavy-duty four-way lug wrenches, broke my 1/2&quot; ratchet driver, 
bent the steel shaft of my floor jack using it like a breaker bar, and 
wreaked havoc on my 19mm box wrench with a hammer -- and only got one lugnut 
free. Two cans of liquid wrench had no effect other than making the carport 
floor a mess (no torch here yet -- but it's on the list). Ended up taking 
the entire wheel/drum assembly to a local garage so they could try the &quot;big 
guns&quot; on it. Even they had trouble, but ultimately all the lugnuts came 
loose. Needless to say, I greased them bad boys up good before re-installing 
them.

After all that, she finally moved -- and even stopped when asked. But now 
the &quot;swishing/grinding&quot; noise that I've mentioned here before got worse. 
Sounded like someone was taking a buzz-saw to the rear-end of my bus. Turns 
out the alternator pulley had started to wear (probably not seated right) 
and was now cutting a nice fat gouge into the face of the alternator. It 
completely pulverized the woodruff key that keeps it from spinning on the 
shaft (just a little bit of metal left), and chewed the hell out of the 
shaft itself. You know how the outer half of the pulley has a 
psuedo-rectangular center hole? Mine ended up perfectly round. Anyways, my 
local ACVW parts guy happened to have a brand new Bosch alternator in stock, 
plus a nice chrome pulley -- so that was today's project.

I'm so happy with the way she's running right now I could just split. I 
mean, I can actually hear the stereo now -- even at low volume! I can leave 
for work in the early a.m. now without pissing off my entire neighborhood! 
Bus is quiet, life is good.

Anyways, thanks again to all who replied with advice and suggestions. I just 
hope I can return the favor sometime!

Later...

Sean,

1970 Microbus (&quot;Mimi&quot;)
