I think 75 is the top I would go. I usually drive my '76 auto at 70 on the
freeway, but it tends to get too hot at that speed (you DO have an oil temp
right? If not GET ONE! Cheapest insurance you can get). On a war day I have
to drive 65 or so, and that's WITH an external oil cooler and fan on it.

&gt; I appreciate everyone's input. I don't want my Westfalia to become a
&gt; &quot;Westfailure&quot;.
