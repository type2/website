I've been reading the archives regarding this subject.  Certainly fodder for
debate.  Seems like most folks prefer the simple, easy-to-fix attributes of
the stock generator.  Mine just gave up the ghost.  Probably just needs
brushes, $5 plus my time.  I don't put huge demands on my generator: mild
stereo -- no amplifier, 35w incandescent fog lamps, 55/60w H4s.  My mechanic
says he'll install an alternator for about $200.  I guess this includes a
new stand.  Doesn't seem too expensive to me.

*	If I never put any more current-draw on the generator, am I better
off leaving it stock? Besides the cost, why?
*	I'm an amateur radio operator have considered putting a 50w
transmitter in there.  Would this addition be too much for the generator to
handle?

One more question: I don't have the '68 owner's manual yet. I figured out
real fast that the red light on the left is the gen light.  Nothing is
labeled.  What's the green one just opposite on the right?  Oil pressure?
I'm getting new senders and pressure/temp gauges this week or next.
