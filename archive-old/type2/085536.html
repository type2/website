Subject: AIRS Help request, Wellsboro PA 2L oil Leak

Hi Volks,

I just got back from Everybus 2002, and this afternoon we had to leave Dave
Ireland at Hills Creek State Park in Wellsboro PA. His 79 2L blew a &quot;cam
gallery plug&quot; this morning  and dumped all its oil into the grass just as we
were getting ready to roll for home. We tried plugging the hole with a
JB-weld encrusted bolt but the fix only lasted about 5 minutes. The hole is
up on the front of the engine and very difficult to reach as the torque
converter is very much in the way.

When we pulled out of camp the maintenance crew at the park was towing his
bus up to their shed so he and they could drop the engine and try a
different fix, but at the moment I have no idea if they were successful. If
someone local could call the park office I'm sure the staff will know what
the &quot;Canadian VW Bus's&quot; status is. Dave could use some local advice on
finding a sympathetic shop to help put in a heli-coil, or rig some other fix
to get him 200 miles home to Kitchener Ontario.

Hills Creek State Park
R.D. 2, Box 328
Wellsboro, PA 16901-9676

Thanks!

Happy trails,
