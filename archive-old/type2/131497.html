Subject: Re: [T2] Wires go to where?

Thanks every one for the help. Karl seems to have split a hair with the 
precision of his answer. I have left them alone. I am about to run out to 
get a few little items for the bus and then will be turning the key on the 
bus. Many many many hands crossing fingers in my head. I will post the 
results, I have been making a laundry list of parts that I still need to 
replace but I think I can get her moving. We'll see...

&gt;From: &quot;Karl&quot; About 6&quot; from the ECU plug, they come out as an even pair, and 
&gt;are about 4&quot; long?
&gt;If yes, they go no where. They are for the high altitude switch that USA 
&gt;buses never had.
&gt;The other end of them just end at the ECU. The USA ECU has no circuit for 
&gt;them. They disappeared from the
&gt;harness's in mid 78.
