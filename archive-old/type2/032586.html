&gt; The oil light on my 73 bus came on this morning as I pulled into my works
&gt;  parking lot. It didn't turn off all the way until I parked it. The light 
has
&gt;  never come on once while driving before (I bought it a few weeks ago, so
&gt;  haven't had it that long). After I parked it, I got out and checked the oil
&gt;  level, it was right on the low line (not the bottom of the stick, but the
&gt;  lower of the two level lines). 
&gt;  
&gt;  Could the oil light come on at that level? I need to drive it tomorrow over
&gt;  100 miles. I plan on going out and adding a quart of oil, but even if that
&gt;  fixes it, do you think it would be safe to drive tommorrow. The engine
&gt;  doesn't leak oil (last I checked). If it sounds normal for the oil light to
&gt;  come on at that level, then I assume it will be safe if I add some oil.
&gt;  
&gt;  Thanks!

Hi Chris,

First it is not normal for the oil light to come on during driving under any 
circumstances.

You say that you checked the oil level and it was on the lower mark of the 
dip stick, as you had been driving the van previously that sounds good to me 
as a lot of the oil will be distributed around the engine not sitting in the 
sump. (also ensure you dip on the flat as with our engines flat sump it makes 
considerable difference.

The oil warning light warns not of low oil level but of a low oil pressure. 
Unless the oil volume reduces to the extent where there is none to be sucked 
up by the pump then the light will not come on due to low oil level.

The oil light comes on for three reasons - low oil pressure, a faulty sender, 
or an electrical fault.
An electrical fault can be as simple as the wire falling off of the pressure 
sender and groundin on the engine or tin-ware.
A faulty sender can be tested only by replacing with a new one, (or replacing 
with a pressure gauge).
Low pressure can be caused by a poor oil pump, or by the pressure regulating 
pistons being stuck, or an oil leak. You dont suggeset an oil leak but one is 
worth looking for particularly where the oil goes into the oil cooler. 
You don't say what engine you have but for a 1600 the pressure sender is to 
the left of the lower fan belt pully, just below the distributor; and the oil 
pressure regulators are at the front and back of the crank case joint onthe 
bottom of the engine looking lie 20mm diameter screw heads.

Good luck
