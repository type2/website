sounds like you answered your own question, the gears are probably
jamming, switch to a manual starter.

also one thing on a auto tranny starter it has a different housing with no
nose cone and sometimes leaves the area open for dirt and water to get
into, not a major problem but to consider.  (auto tranny bell housings are
open air things)
