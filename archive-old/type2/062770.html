Subject: Re: Where to put radio in '66

Markus,

I keep my stock radio in the dash (an AM Blaupunkt) and have an AM/FM 
cassette deck behind the driver's seat.  I can werk the volume and 
such very well whilst driving.  Changing a cassette is a little bit 
of a skill developed over time though....

What're you gonna do with your stock radio.  -Still looking for the 
correct knobs on mine. ;^)
