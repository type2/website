Subject: engine tin to body foam seal

&gt;From: Frank E Biffath III
&gt; Just a quick question, Is it necessary to remove the engine in 2.0
(77-79) to install the engine
&gt; seal?
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;
&gt;I am assuming you mean the foam seal that goes around the engine tin to the
body?
&gt;
&gt;No, you put in on with the engine in.

&gt;No other way to do it.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

&gt;You have to remove the air filter assembly. Most
&gt;people put the ends at the rear but I find it easier to butt the ends at
the front, by the throttle cable.
&gt;This makes it easier to clear the injectors on the right side.

I have put this seal in many times with the engine still in the bus. It is a
lot of work requiring a lot of bending over while buried head first in the
engine compartment and a lot of crawling under the bus and a lot of going
back and forth and poking will cloth wrapped (dulled) screwdirvers and
pulling gently with long, straight and bent, needle nosed pliers. Much
easier job with a good buddy helping.

If we are talking about the same big soft double cut foam seal. One cut
provides lips that slip over the engine tin edge, and the other cut provides
lips that slip over the body flange. I don't think the seal will stay in
place on the engine tin edge when you are reinstalling a removed engine. At
least that is my experience, so I always put the engine in, then put in the
seal. If the seal is missing or deteriorated to worthlessness; I certainly
leave the engine installed and replace the seal. It is not all that much
work and it is so important to have that seal in place.
