Subject: Re: [T2] brake calipers

Jamie,
It is hell to find properly re-built calipers. No one cares or knows.
The pistons cut-outs are supposed to point upwards (check picture in
Bentley as it may be the opposite) and there has to be a bleeder at
the TOP of the caliper. I don't know why there are cut outs and why
they point up, but that is the way Bentley shows it, hence that is the
way to do it right.

If you still have your old calipers I would advise you to rebuild them
yourself. I do it with a foot pump, some pieces of wood, time, care
and luv, My calipers rock and I've rebuilt a few pairs for a friend.
Busdepot carries rebuild kits.

Otherwise you can buy rebuilt junk and turn the pistons by using
compressed air from the aforementioned air pump of a compressor if you
own one to eject the piston and re-position them right.

Do it right and your front brakes will please you for a long time.

- Arnaud
