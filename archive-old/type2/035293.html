Subject: Re: Hi-beam switch on '71-where do wires go?

A few years ago the turn signal / high beam switch broke apart in my 72
Campmobile and I couldn't afford to replace the assembly.  Since my signal
switch was toast I just cut the wires and took the switch assembly out.
At the FLAPS I bought a Single Pole Double Throw toggle switch and a heavy duty
push button switch.  I formed a metal bracket and attached it to the turn
signal switch housing on the stearing column with small machine screws.  This
metal bracket holds the toggle switch which is wired in place of the turn
signal switch.  Up = right turn, Center = off, Down = left turn.  It works
great even though it's several inches shorter than the stock turn switch arm.
I wired the push button switch into a convient hole on the dash and wired the
High Beam wires to it.  It's not a convient location, but I don't get to use
the high beams much anyway.  I see this as a temporary solution until I can but
the proper part.
I'm sorry I don't have a better answer to your question Marv.

&gt; anyone know where the beam switching wire

&gt; changing the ign. sw in our 71 SC. BD doesn't have the switch listed, and JC
&gt; whipmee doesn't have one listed for that exact year. Plus I'm not sure I can
&gt; afford a new one anyway. Ends up that it's stuck in high beam..
