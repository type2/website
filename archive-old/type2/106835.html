&gt; I am working on a 72 deluxe that has been sitting in a

&gt; the headlights will only come ON when the ignition
&gt; switch is turned to the OFF position, obviously it
&gt; should be exactly the opposite, the lights should come
&gt; on only when the ignition switch is on. So, is
&gt; something wired backwards? Is it likely a headlight
&gt; switch problem, an ignition switch problem, or bad wiring??

There _is_ a wire coming from the ignition switch that is hot only when
the key is off.  If the switch has been replaced it might have been
miswired.
