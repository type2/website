Subject: Re: [T2] Leaky Doors???

&gt; I DO have the door gaskets installed, and they're installed pretty well too
&gt; and definitely keep a good seal. I was wondering if... it wouldn't be a good
&gt; idea for me to drill maybe 1 or 2 small holes in the bottom of the door so
&gt; that the water could drain out if any happens to get in there? Is this a bad
&gt; idea? I would of course sand the area down, and re-paint the inside of the
&gt; holes, etc. It would be to prevent the base of the door from rusting now.
&gt;
&gt; You could say.. &quot;well, the door has lasted this long without rust... what
&gt; makes you think you need to do this now?&quot; well, the way I see it.. my

The doors should alredy have drain holes in them.
they were never expected to be waterproof completely
originally there would have bben a plastic liner behind the door panel as
well to keep water from ruining it.
