Subject: [T2] 1700, 1800, 2000 Trannies the same?

I have a 72 Westie with a bad trannie but I have a 1800 motor.  The numbers
show that it was a 1974 FI 1800 but now is dual carbs and electric fuel
pump.  Stock for 72 was a 1700 carb Type IV.  In order for me to get the
right trannie for my application what do I need to consider?  Are all
trannies the same for the bay windows?  Where did freeway fliers come from?
VW?
Where would you order a transmission from if it was your bus?  Thanks for
taking the time to read my ?'s.  Now if you got a answer let me know
