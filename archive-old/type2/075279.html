Subject: Re: [T2] type IV oil cooler on 1600?

&gt; Does anyone on the list know if an oil cooler from a 2.0L engine will fit a
&gt; 1600DP?
&gt; and, if not, are there any that are interchangeable?

Not without modding the doghouse shroud. This is a mod that some folk have
done which gives a little better cooling but requires some cutting and
welding on the fan shroud.
It wouldnt be practical for a non-doghouse shroud.
If you dont need the cooling I would recommend a NEW cooler. it should be
60-75 or so dollars.
