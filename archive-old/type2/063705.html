Subject: Re: stickers/cops (longish)

I've been reading this thread and I thought I'd share one of my
experiences with you. 
My 78 camper is a DEADicated, multi-stickered, multi-colored Deadhead's
delight. To put it lightly, she is &quot;colorful&quot;. I've worked long and hard
on her decoration which has led her to become a &quot;cop magnet&quot;. 
Last summer while driving up interstate 77 North thru Virginia, we passed
by a drug bust in progress in a town called Wytheville. Jokingly I told
the girl riding with me that if they saw us, we'd be next. They musta saw
us....next thing I know there's blue lights behind me as I was pulling up
on the on ramp. I noted my speed which was 45. The on ramp was a steep
incline (mountainous area). Anyhow, I pull over and pass my registration
and driver's license to the state trooper. I know everything is legal so
I'm not really &quot;that&quot; worried. :)
After calling my plates in (BTW, the plates read: GR8TFUL), he blatently
made a sniffing sound and said he smelled marijuana and that I need to
step out of the van. (ok, we're not the stereo-typical types...we don't
have any drugs on us) I told the officer that he had to be mistaken...we
didn't have any drugs or anything illegal on us for that matter. He
insisted that he smelled marijuana and that he would call over the drug
dogs. I am informed (you learn to be after following the Grateful Dead
around in a VW bus for years) and I told the officer that I had nothing to
hide and that I've broken no law that I was aware of. Again, he insisted.
I STUPIDLY consented to search. I kept telling him that not all &quot;colorful&quot;
folk were drug users. Next thing ya know.....here comes a parade of state
troopers. We had 3 additional troopers along with 2 K9 units pull in and
surround us. They escorted us away from the bus and we stood and watched
them rip thru our possessions. Underwear flew, bags were ripped open,
boxes were emptied, dogs were walking on everything....it was a hoot. They
couldn't find anything (duh) and finally gave up on the search for the
mother lode. 
After being held there for almost an hour, the assisting officers left and
we're back with our original buddy trooper. I ask him if we're free to go
yet. He started writing a citation...to my surprise. He cited me for
&quot;impeding the safe flow of traffic&quot;. I was doing 5 miles under the posted
limit for the on ramp! I tried to make an argument over it, but he told me
I could fight it in court and that if I didn't drop it, he would have to
take me down to the station!!
My citation cost me fifty dollars. My itinerary didn't allow for me to
come back to Virginia to fight this ridiculous citation.
We got back on the interstate and he followed us for about 5 miles. I
guess he was trying to catch us doing something wrong to justify his
actions. At the next rest area we pulled over and re-packed our things
(strewn everywhere!). 
I'll NEVER, NEVER, NEVER and I repeat....NEVER consent to search again.
There are some people who are out to get you no matter what the
circumstances. 
 
I was pulled over again this summer in North Carolina for &quot;wobbling&quot;. The
officer ran my plates and everything came back legal. He then pulled out a
&quot;consent to search form&quot; and I told him my story about Virginia...and told
him that I'd NEVER consent again. He told me not to judge all cops by the
actions of that Va. state trooper...and in return he'd not judge all
colorful people by the stereo-type. We agreed...shook hands and went on
our way. 
 
What a long, strange trip it's been.....
