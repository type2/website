Well, I might agree that the red bars (and thank you very much for
reminding me of the color coding, I had forgotten :) were too stiff for a
passenger bus if:  (a) the were NOS, and (b) you drove the passenger van
essentially empty most of the time.  My preference for the heavy duty bars
is that as time goes on, fatigue makes the bar less springy, no matter
what grade it started as and also I tend to travel with a couple hundred
pounds of misc. junk at all times :-) In my situation, if I hadda replace,
I would look for the heavy duty bars.  

Way back at the dawn of time, I wanted to have my bus's rear end sag fixed
by resetting the plates, but the mechanic advised against it.  His
position is that rotating the plate allows the bar to flex further than it
used to before it would hit the stop.  With an aged bar that might cause
it to snap.  I have never heard of a VW rear bar breaking (if properly
installed) and we have many people here who have successfully reset their
plates but YMMV! 

On that note, tho, if you or any list member does salvage a set of bars,
remember that they come prestressed for right and left side!!!!  It is
very important that they be installed on the correct side of the bus or
you are setting yourself up for disaster!!!

&gt; 
&gt; My present passenger bus has a sagging rear so that's a job for the 
&gt; summer. I wonder if I'll be able to get any red bars if I need them?

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
