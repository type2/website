&gt;Starting with the OSU. I got it off and found that the plastic part with the

You probably to replace it. The new ones don't do that.

&gt;I don't really think that this is my leak, however, because the 
&gt;OSU was tight in the case, and it doesn't seem that that much oil would 
&gt;escape through the loose plastic part. I'm thinking that I should look at 
&gt;the oil pump next??? Maybe the oil cooler???

That's what I would do but first I would watch the oil pressure switch from the top while the engine is running to see how much it leaks.
