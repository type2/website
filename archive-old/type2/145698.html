Subject: Re: [T2] Series Resistors versus Double Relays

From your experience, which would be the thing to go
bad, the Series Resistor or the Double Relay.

RAtwell, in &quot;Double Relay Demistified&quot;, says bout
the double relay, &quot;It's mounted below the series 
resistors [plural?? what goes...] that power the 
fuel injectors and two plugs connect to the bottom.&quot;
 
Reading this, and the electro-mechanical aspects of
the Double Relay, I would expect to see a greater
chance of failure [If you fry the relay . . .] 
of this series resistor.  What say you??
 
-----------------------------------------------------

It [the series resister] is plural because there are 4
resisters in it, one for each injector. If you look at
the wiring diagram, you will see 5 wires going to it.
One common in and four out.

In the past 10+ years I have only seen 1 resister bad 
and only one circuit was dead [open]. Bus still ran on
3 cylinders.

The double relay has a fairly high failure rate.
Probably because it has 2 relays and diodes in it, it
does not like excessive charging voltage.
