Subject: Re: [T2] looking for tool

A multimeter is the best bet Richard, it does that and a myriad more things
besides. They are cheap, and very accurate. I wouldn't bother with a circuit
tester when you can have a multi function tool for probably the same price.
I see them as cheap as 8 dollars sometimes, since we started living off the
backs of the 3rd world.

HTH,

Courtney

Can anyone recommend a good 12v circuit tester that is LED based and will
draw a minimum amount of current when compared to a typical incandescent
bulb test light?
