Subject: VW/Porsche Steering Wheels

Hello esteemed listees:

Does anyone know if the splines on a 71 bus steering column are the same as on most 70's - 80's Porsches???  Someone told me that Porsche steering wheels will fit at least early Bay Busses.  Can anyone confirm or refute this?

Thanks,

Jim Hood
71 Bohemoth Panel Bus
