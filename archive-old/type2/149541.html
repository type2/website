Subject: RE: [T2] starting problem update

Karl you're the king! That was it! I went out switched the wire around, and 
he fired right up. Runs like a scalded dog! And now I know what a plenum is. 
Someday all you folks are gonna make me smart.

Thanks so much to everyone who responded.

And Richard, your website is such a great resource. It's helped me out many 
times. Keep it up!!
