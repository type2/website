&lt;Hi All,I tried to back my '78 up a steep hill and it wouldn't go.  &lt;As 
I gave it
&lt;gas and let the clutch out it felt kind of like the clutch was 
&lt;slipping, only
&lt;I guess it wasn't since the engine slowed and stalled after a foot &lt;or 
so.
&lt;I was able to turn around and go up the same steep hill forwards &lt;with 
no
&lt;problems at all. 
 &lt;Someone told me that it could
&lt;be something in the rear brakes.  Something to do with which brake 
&lt;shoe
&lt;is 'leading' when you are going in a certain direction.


   Sound to me like your on the right track with the brakes. Better 
check that clutch though, it shouldn't even &quot;feel like&quot; it's slipping.
