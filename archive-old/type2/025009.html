Howdy all. Being Friday and all, I thought I'd share last weekend's bus mission
with you. A while back, fellow listmember Pat Flynn of Maryland posted an extra
'66 camper he had for sale. It had some problems and pieces missing, but he
wanted to see it go to a good home, instead of being parted out. So, since my
roommate has been looking to join the bus family, we made arrangements to head
up there last Friday to bring it home.
  Thursday afternoon, I decided to replace the throwout bearing on my '67
camper, since it had been getting noisier over the last few months. I had an
extra, so I pulled the engine in the handy YMCA parking lot across from my
house. To my dismay, the clutch plate, one of the old 3-arm types, had begun to
eat itself, and would need replacement as well. Since the stores were all
closed, I had to push everything under the bus and close it up for the night.
 The next afternoon, after putting in the new clutch, we loaded up my bus with
4 new wheels and tires, and headed up for Arnold, MD, from Raleigh. the trip
was happily uneventful, although somewhat lengthy...We dropped off 2 friends at
a music festival nearby, and went to sleep for the night.
Rising bright and ever-so-early, thanks to a very noisy parking lot, we arrived
at Pat's around 7 or so Saturday morning. The bus we were getting was in pretty
good shape, despite the normal floor and rocker rust. We set about doing a tune
up, and were pleased to see very clean oil, and all valves set right on. After
bleeding the brakes, we were able to start it up and drive around the yard.
Yay!
In the meantime, pat brought us coffee and some fantastic blueberry-banana
muffins that his wife made.
After that, we turned to Pat's '67 Westy, checking and bleeding the brakes on
it, fixing the gas guage, and replacing the engine compartment seal. The
ancient distributor on there wasn't advancing at all, which was the reason for
his buying the 009 that has been the subject of recent posts.
Anyway, after getting everything all cleaned up, Pat gave us the scenic tour of
Annapolis, and took us out to a nifty Irish pub.
Finally, we headed back down the road, only to find the new bus running worse
and worse. After about 10 miles, we pulled off the side of the 10 lane highway,
to check it out, with traffic speeding by a couple feet away. The spark plugs
were terribly fouled out, so we changed them, and tweaked the carburator.
Another mile away, it was still horrible, so we changed for a spare carb I had
in the bus...It ran great after that, and we began the journey home...
All in all, 300 plus miles with the new bus, which has already begun to shape
up in my roommate's care.
Anyway, it was a lot of fun, and Pat and his wife are great and very hospitable
folks. It was a fun weekend indeed...
Happy Search &amp; Rescue!
:)
