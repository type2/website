Well.. I am not All knowing, but, a I do know that is sometimes referred
to as the &quot;silver socket&quot;  The euro equivalent to the cig lighter

the early buses [shall I hazard to say, Westfalia] had a &quot;chandelier&quot;  and
the air pump are the only accessories I have seen,,

here is a pic of the air pump, and spare tire

&gt; Hi Frank,
&gt;
&gt; Quarter inch aperature approximately centered under the glove box,
&gt; right?
&gt;
&gt; That's a european 12V accessory outlet.  I'm told higher-end BMW
&gt; touring motorcycles share the same system. Jamie Rivers has a original
&gt; Coleman 12V air compressor that plugs into it, it's the only accessory
&gt; I have ever seen for that plug.
