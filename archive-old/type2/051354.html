Subject: [T2] Re: magnets in/on your gas tank

Gee, maybe I shnould take that old cb antenna base and plaster it to the
bottom of my tank?  That sucker will magnetize anything, you can't pull
it off our fridge!  Is rust magnetic??

quoth Jim Mowdecker:
&gt; Maybe it would collect rust? In which case putting the cow magnet in (the gas tank) might
&gt; not be a bad idea.
