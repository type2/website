Subject: Re: [T2] PC in Bus

Sorry I wasn't clear. I was talking about LCD TVs. And I can pick up used 
LCD monitors for around $150. (I only paid $165 for the 17&quot; LCD I use at 
home.) I saw a 13.3&quot; LCD TV on clearance for $339. Ouch.

Yes, I've got the second battery and a place to put it. Just waiting to take 
care of some other things before installing it with the relay.

Plus I've got a switch so if it's on mains power it doesn't draw from the 
battery.

I'm not a big Xbox fan, so that's not going to be an option. I also have a 
nice laptop, but it's not going to be as convenient as having everything 
built in.

I'm really thinking I'm going to have to rewire this entire bus. The thing 
is loaded with &quot;hippie&quot; wiring, dangling hot wires, shorts, etc. I've spent 
2 days trying to figure it all out and still have a short I can't find. :(

A 15&quot; LCD may draw less power, but there is no way that it is cheaper than a 
13&quot; color TV Set. I picked up a 13&quot; TV at Walmart last fall for $89 CDN. I 
have yet to see a new LCD monitor sell for less than $400 CDN.

Another factor to consider is visibility. LCD's have improved immensely in 
the past few years, but even the newest models can still be very difficult 
to view in direct sunlight. And that $89 television includes a tuner and a 
speaker, features that are not typically built in to most LCD displays.

Being concerned about power consumption is EXACTLY why you should be looking 
at a laptop for your bus. Get a PC-Card or USB TV tuner and you've got the 
best of both worlds.

&lt;/snip&gt;
