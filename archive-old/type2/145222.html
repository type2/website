Subject: truck being restored

hey folks, i just figured out how to work my digital
camera and upload pics to the web.  I snapped a couple
of pics yestrday of my '74 single cab in the body shop
while being restored.  First pic is of when I bought
if off thesamba_dot_com a couple of years back.  It should
be ready in the next couple of weeks so I can get it
back and put it all back together!  I'll post more
pics when it's finished if anyone's interested. Greg
