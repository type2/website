Subject: Re: [T2] stuck exhaust gasket

&gt;I had one exhaust gasket that would not come out of the head. (The round 
&gt;copper gaskets between the heat exchanger and the head.)  I have tried to 
&gt;pry it out with a pocket knife and a small screwdriver blade bent at a 
&gt;right angle, but it will not budge. Any ideas about how I could get this out?

A shot of PB Blaster, then take a medium screwdriver and use the business 
end to tap-tap-tap all around the perimeter a hundred times, 'nother shot 
of penetrant, more tap-tap-tapping. It just may come loose. If not, get a 
90 degree hook scribe and try to force it under the copper at various 
points around. Once you get it to move a hair, work it back and forth and 
it will become looser and looser and move more and more until you can get a 
good grip and force it cattywampus and out.

&gt;  I am still at a loss to explain the exhaust leak.  My heater boxes look 
&gt; fine and the muffler had already been replaced.  The gaskets showed no 
&gt; signs of warpage or damage.

Get a giant flat file. Push it across the two header pipe openings that 
seat against the copper gasket. Get a flat and parallel file image??? No?? 
Continue stroking until you do. I always watch for files at garage sales. 
If I see one of a size or shape or type I don't have, I pick it up. Must 
have 30 files of great variety, including one 18&quot; long of raspy nature that 
I use for this particular application. I'm sure I paid chump change for it. 
Didn't know what I might use it for at the time, just that it would quite 
evidently do some jobs better than anything else. I would hate to have to 
go down to Lowe's and pay 30+ discount dollars for a new Nicholson like that.
