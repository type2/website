Subject: FW: EMPI/BugPack WARNING!!!!!!!!

Folks,

This is so true. Just finished rebuilding a B series 1600 DP for my 71
Campmobile. (For Sale) Ran the engine and was surprised to hear a rapping
sound. I initially thought it was from the heads, which were fairly new. I
installed another set of larger valve heads, reassembled and reinstalled the
engine. Started her up. Same sound. I then called a VW mechanic friend and
had him come over. We took a piece of breather hose and did the stethescope
treatement. No rapping from the engine or heads. Put the hose on the center
of the exhaust. Loud rapping sound. I couldn't believe it! How could an
exhaust make a noise like that. I installed a merged with single muffler. No
more rapping, lots of smooth power.
I think the baffle in the stock style empi had somehow come loose from a bad
weld or something. You can not make the noise by shaking the exhaust. Only
by running the engine. I lost big hours and a nice set of large valve heads.
Moral of the story.
Don't buy EMPI!

&gt; All,
&gt;
&gt; In light of all the new listees and people new to
&gt; busses, I figure it's time to post this warning again.
&gt;
&gt; DO NOT BUY EMPI, OR BUGPACK PARTS FOR YOUR BUS!!!!!
&gt; THEY ARE *CRAP* AND NOT WORTHY OF *ANY* USE, OTHER
&gt; THAN A PAPER-WEIGHT!!!!
&gt;
&gt; Yes, both companies make acceptable dress-up items,
&gt; but exhaust systems, tappets, etc., are all SH!T!
&gt;
&gt; Spend the extra couple of dollars now, or be prepared
&gt; to spend a *lot* more next time (and it *will* be
&gt; soon, I assure you).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; OK, I'm off my soap-box now.....just don't wan't to
&gt; see anybody taken like I was in the past (NEVER again,
&gt; though;-)
&gt;
