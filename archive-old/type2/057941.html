Subject: RE:  Oil Temp Gauge: The Wiring and Such

&gt;it says the gauge needs a wire from a +12V source (&quot;usually the 
&gt;fuse box&quot; it says) and a wire from the light switch.  

The 'light' wire for the gauge should draw its power from the same wire
that powers the rest of your dash lights.  That way if you dim your dash
lights, the gauge light will dim accordingly.  My 73 uses those tiny
1/8&quot; spade connectors for the dash lights and I can't find any
'splitter' spade connectors that size so you may have to cut/splice a
new wire into that circuit.  Maybe the 79's used normal size connectors?

The other 12v power needs to be one that is only hot when the ignition
is on.  So get out your handy dandy multimeter (or a 12v bulb attached
to 2 wires) and find a fuse that is only hot when the key is on.  Then,
if you want to do it nice, remove the 2 screws that hold the fuse panel
to the bus so you can get at the back side.  Pull off whatever wire is
attached to the fuse block that you want to use and put on a 'splitter'
spade (available at any parts store) so you have 2 spades to plug into -
1 for the original wire and 1 for the new wire going to your gauge.

BTW, another listee suggested using trailer wire for connecting
additional gauges.  This worked nicely for me this past weekend.  I
bought a 4-strand, 25 foot trailer wiring kit for $10 and ran the wire
from my dash-mounted gauges, behind the kick panels, under the rubber
mats, through the Westy seat, into the engine compartment where it
terminates in the 4-prong trailer connector.  Then I attached the other
side of the connector's wires to my coil (tach), oil temp sender, and
oil pressure sender.  That way, next time I pull the engine all I have
to do is unplug the trailer wire connector to disconnect those 3
senders.  And I've still got 1 more wire to use (cyl head temp?).

Hope this helps.
