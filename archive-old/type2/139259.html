&gt;Well, the T4 will certainly be more dependable power. It takes a
&gt;pretty punched out T1 to equal the stock T4. It is geared for the
&gt;hills, but it will be slower than a bay with the corvair.

&gt;&gt;   I appreciate the feedback on this. A T4 powerplant would be nice and
&gt;&gt; easy since I'm familiar with them (rebuilt a couple). Does anyone know
&gt;&gt; if the later bay engine support will bolt in to my 68 without major
&gt;&gt; mods?

From what I have heard it is a REAL BEAR to fit a Type 4 into an early bay
(read: major mods) and I have still never seen one.  And we all know how
long it takes to get a trans-vair on the road ;)  IMHO you are best sticking
with Type1 power in a '68 if you want an easy path.

From my punched-out T1 experience, I recommend going with a 1776cc Type1
with 041 heads (port work optional), a counterweighted crank, engle 100 cam
or equivalent, fueled by Dellorto DRLA carbs, and driving an 091 trans from
a 76-79 bus.  This is still a mild engine, C/R at 7.3:1.  Runs cool for
longevity.  Enough power to move a Westy with dignity and alacrity.  Can be
assembled by a pro for ~$1600 with all new parts (carbs and trans extra).
Smokes buses with stock T4's.  Supposedly the stroker 1914cc is even better
but costs a bit more and is a little more modified (custom pushrods, etc.).

PS. any early bay owners who need the NLA front trans mount, I pulled what
looks like a good one from a junkyard last weekend.
