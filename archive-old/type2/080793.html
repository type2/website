Subject: Electric bus

And hey!  It's not about a Deadhead tour...

Do you folks remember Topher Waring?  He's the middle school shop teacher in
Vermont who rebuilds his electric loaf each year with new groups of
students, then they run it in the Tour de Sol.   Hoot all you like about
electric vehicles and buses in particular, you have to start somewhere and I
admire the guy.  Check out this new bus (not his).

&gt;John:
&gt;
&gt;        I am just back from this year's Tour de Sol as a judge. There was a
&gt;vehicle there you must see.  Check out    www.revolutionride_dot_org
&gt;
&gt;lets me know what you think.  Yours, Topher ( Helios the Heron)
