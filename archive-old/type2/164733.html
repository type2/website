Subject: re:oNCE AGAIN...THE TIRE/RIM CORUNDUM

Hi,

 

I just saw your post about some modifications to your bus. I've heard about
a sway away bar, but what are they exactly, and how do they affect the
handling of your bus? What are the con's of putting them in?

 

The PO installed a new front beam on my bus, with disc brakes. I like the
disc brakes, I don't like that he also lowered the bus(front and rear). I
believe this was to accommodate the disc brake package. The ride is pretty
rough, I feel all the bumps in the road. I think the front shocks maybe too
stiff, as someone at the nearest shop told me. It also seems like the rear
end drifts a little on turns. It doesn't actually slide across the road, it
just feels a little odd. Os I'm looking for ideas on how to change the ride.

 

Thanks.

 

-Kevin
