Subject: Re: Speaker Positions....?

&gt;conversion '68 type 2 - my question is...
&gt;
&gt;       1: what speaker set-up can you recomend
&gt;
&gt;       2: where would you put the speakers
&gt;

I have a two rather bottom of the line 4&quot; speakers mounted in the doors
where the stock 4&quot; were, and a 10&quot; subwoofer which uses the refrigerator
hardware(non-working in my bus) for a box.

It actually sounds pretty good if I'm moving pretty slow, but soon as speed
increases road and wind noise defeat the bass.

Improvements I'm thinking about (when money and time come available
simultaneously):  nicer 5.25&quot; speakers in the doors with separable tweeters
which I'll mount above the vents on the dash, or perhaps even above the
windshield; moving the sub closer to the front of the vehicle so it makes
more of a difference up front at high speed.

Let me know what you do and how it works out.
