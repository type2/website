Subject: Re: Stranded, Ignition switch won't turn all the way

OK,

I think I found my answer in the archives:


1. Make a &quot;remote starter switch&quot; pushbutton switch normally open with one
wire to the &quot;little wire&quot; on the starter and the other wire to battery &quot;+&quot;

This provides +12 to the solenoid when you push the button and will turn
the starter over but not start the motor. For actually getting fire you
need to:

2. Make a jumper with at least 12 gauge wire and run it from battery &quot;+&quot; to
the &quot;+&quot; side of the coil. This part acts like turning the key switch to the
&quot;run&quot; position.

We'll see if that works. I will exercise great caution. I appreciate
any other suggestions or insights into what may be causing the switch
to fail to turn completely.

thanks
