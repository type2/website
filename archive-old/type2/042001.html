Subject: Re: Ball Joints and oil breather

&gt; Should I or shouldn't I try to attempt to do my own BAll JOINTS?
&gt; It is extremely expensive.  Not just the parts...Getting quotes of 180.00
&gt; for all four (german).  But Labor is rediculous...
&gt; What are the biggies to be aware of?

Lots of people say don't even try it yourself and I, after doing it myself,
would have to agree.  Unless you have access to a several ton press, that
is.  I also would not take the bus to a shop and have them do the whole
thing.  The labor cost will be crazy as you have already stated.  Take
everything apart yourself and when you get to the point of
removing/installing the ball joints take them down to a machine shop and
have them pressed in/out.  Actually I would even go as far as to say go
ahead and press them out yourself.  Mine came out rather easily with a few
&quot;presses&quot; from a 5 lb. sledge.  I pressed the new ones in with a multi
stepped procedure involving an  inverted floor jack, modified gear pullers,
and some galvanized pipe caps that were never intended to hold up to the
pressure I subjected them to. BIG PITA.

&gt; Number 2:
&gt; Oil breather on a t4 engine.._dot_can someone please explain the purpose of
it?
&gt; Don't want to sound dumb, but I want a technical point of view on it...?
&gt; Thanks!
&gt; Lo

By oil breather I am assuming you are referring to the pipe/hole on the
top/rear of the case (rear is rear).  As far as I know, it's purpose is to
allow pressure from the case out.  All the stuff whirling around in there
creates a lot of it.  Where the air goes is not that big of concern as long
as it either goes out of the engine compartment (ask me about the &quot;Coke can
and electrical tape&quot; breather box) or into the intake system, which is where
mine goes.


Have fun with those joints. Bwahahahahhahahahahah.  Just kidding. It's not
that hard.
