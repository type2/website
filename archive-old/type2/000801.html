&gt; Hello everyone.  I am wondering if anyone knows of a parts supplier who
&gt; sells the black pedestal mats that wrap around the the top side of the
&gt; wheel well.  (under the driver &amp;  passenger seats)  I just need the part
&gt; that wraps around from the back and covers the opening under the seat.


I stock these.  The section directly under the seats and the section just to
the insides of the seats are two different part numbers.  The section
directly under the seats is $39.95/pair, the section to the insides of them
is $44.95/pair.  (A &quot;pair&quot; means it does both seat pedastals.)
