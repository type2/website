&lt;&lt; 5) Regarding alternatives to spraying, has anybody heard of using (or 
used) 
foam rollers to apply the paint? Long
time ago, when we wanted to achieve a really shiny finish on furniture, we 
would use cloth to apply abound 10
coats of varnish and the surface would be almost glass like, and we only 
used 220grit sand paper....

Don't laugh...What you're talking about is a traditional &quot;coach finish&quot; that
was on many cars of the thirties...They may still sell the paint (but I've
only seen it advertised in a few old copies of &quot;Practical Classics&quot; out of
the UK). Same deal, many, many coats of paint, sanding between each 
one...Requires a really clean area to achieve that kind of finish with lots
and lots of time...Saw a Bentley at a car show with a finish that was in-
credible...The guy could take a yardstick and hold it against the car and
you could read the numbers three feet into the paint...He said it took a-
bout six months of off again on again work to get the finish...Oh yeah,
since the car had piping, all the body panels were painted and then as-
sembled...
