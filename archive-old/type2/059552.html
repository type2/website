Bob,

The &quot;cal look&quot; seals particularly have this problem, they don't get wedged
far enough out in the corners without the plastic trim strip, particularly
those incredibly sharp and contoured lower corners.  Now assuming some
basics like the frame was restored to impeccable condition before you
replaced the seal so that your problem actually is the seal, you are
somewhat screwed.  Problem is those seals don't move around much after
installation, bus windshields are a real bear, usually you get them off a
bit side to side and it is one corner with a gap that leaks.  If yours was
well centered and both show gaps only real thing to do is let the van sit
facing the sunlight on a real warm day (getting hard to find round the mid
atlantic now) the get two people and try working the windshield in and out,
shoving hard on the corners with your palms, vibrating it as much as you can
(glass should be moving at least 1/16&quot; with every shove?) while the other
person tries to work the seal down into the corner from above and the side.
The shove and release, shove and release on the glass alone may get things a
bit better seated.  I've never cracked one this way BTW but anything is
possible that is a REAL touchy windshield.  If you can't get anything, you
will have to buy another seal, cut this one out and try again.  When
installing bunch the rubber up towards the corners as much as you can, start
on the center top and center bottom when you have the thing up in place with
the string, and right before you pull it in work the seal towards the
corners while shoving it in a bit to initially seat and hold the rubber in
position.  Working the strings (which I wrap 3 time typically) in both
directions can also help sometimes (end both ends at center top and work
both ways from up there, that will move the rubber from center out and from
top to bottom) though this can be a bit unpredictable as the string ends
will be wrapped over and might catch each other.  Short of all of this, and
a cheap possible but not great fix for the current situation, I have some
tubes of very thin flowable silicone sealant (clear) Permatex brand I bought
years ago.  The stuff is thin, about the consistency of glycerine and comes
with a real small tip.  I typically  go round once with this stuff after
installation of a windshield after it has sat for about a week under the
exterior flap, concentrating in the corners.  It wipes off easily and cures
up in about a day fully.
