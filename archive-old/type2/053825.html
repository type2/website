Dear Folks,

Much has transpired since last I wrote to you. Phil Gowdy of Strathmore,
Ontario has the Hubcap and Tour Box now. He was kind enough to have the film
in the one-use camera that was in the Tour Box processed and the photos that
turned out are up on the web page at http://www.type2_dot_com/~chuff/Photos1.htm
. (Please don't shoot me, oh Unix Gods, I will fix the cap in &quot;P&quot;hotos :-)
but it's there for the short run-blame my grade school teachers for brain
washing me).

We do need your help in identifying all the people and the locations shown
in these photos. Please write me at pearlgrl_at_bellsouth_dot_net if you have any
information about them.

Jamie Rivers's two trip reports are also on the web page at
http://www.type2_dot_com/~chuff/trip_reports_1.htm . I want to thank Jamie for
all the work he has done in promoting the Tour. He has done much to get the
word out and to get the Canadian leg of the Tour going. He also wrote me
about some photos on the MVVC's page showing both John Hartranft's neat
banner and an inverted view of the hubcap and tour box (so that's what it
looks like when you're standing on your head!). Those pictures can be viewed
at http://www.vvwca_dot_org/mvvc/00wrapup.htm which is a web page devoted to the
Auburn Hills Show and more specifically at
http://www.vvwca_dot_org/mvvc/BusTour2.JPG  and
http://www.vvwca_dot_org/mvvc/BusTour1.JPG . Thanks to Jamie for letting us know
about those too.

Phil has written me that work precludes him from advancing the Tour until
the latter part of the month, but I will update you all when he starts the
Hubcap rolling again. He was also kind enough to scan the pages in the Log
Book from John Hartranft's entries to the present and I will try to get
those up on the web page along with all the other entries as soon as I can
stay home long enough to do it!

If you are tired of getting this newsletter and want off the Friends of the
Tour or Great Bus Tour Driver's update list, please write me at
pearlgrl_at_bellsouth_dot_net and put &quot;Take me of this list!&quot; in the subject line.

Until there is more to tell, we remain,

Yours Truly,

Chris Huff and Gus in Atlanta
