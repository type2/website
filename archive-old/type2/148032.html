Subject: Re: [T2] What to do while engine is apart?

Hi Erik,

I'd do a compression test (after adjusting valves of course) to see
where you really stand on the status of your engine before deciding
what needs to be replaced. If it comes up good, and you have correct
end play, you might pass on the P&amp;C kit (about $85 depending on where
you shop). 50K is about the upper limit for air cooled heads though.
At a minimum consider replacing exhaust valves, a very small expense.
If you have access to a valve spring tool, you might inspect the
remaining valves and seats and at least lap the surfaces if they look
good otherwise. Also do the wiggle test on the valves once the springs
are off to see if your guides are in spec.

Definitely redo the intake boots. Another small expense!

John

&gt; I keep getting different opinions as to what else needs replacing

&gt; a few said.  Intake manifold rubbers, someone said.  Upgrade the
&gt; oil cooler to Type 4, someone else suggested.
