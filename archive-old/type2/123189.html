&gt; well.   Compression is low but enough (I think) 90,90,75,90.  Pressure in
&gt; the fuel line is #40. Now it won't start and the engine compartment reeks of
&gt; gas.  When I pulled the spark plugs, they smelt of gas and had a black dry
&gt; coat.

sounds possibly like the points maybe isn't working or the new coil is not
hooked up right, if the injectors weren't working the spark plugs would
not be wet with gas.
&gt; 
&gt; I recently put a gasoline &quot;cleaner&quot; additive in my gas tank (Prolong) and I
&gt; wonder it this ruined the injectors somehow.  I suspect the injectors and or
&gt; cold start valve.

can't imagine it being that bad, for the injectors to ruin em, I would
suspect something electrical

&gt; What is the best way to test the injectors?  What does the intense gas smell
&gt; indicate?

the intense smell of gas indictate that your injectors are probably
working fine. or at least well enough for the engine to start.

I would suspect the spark plugs are not firing for some reason, put the
old plugs and coil back on to check.   there are other tecniques in the
bentley for testing too
