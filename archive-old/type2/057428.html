&gt; As far as engine seals go, I've accidentally driven around without

maintain in
&gt; the engine compartment, meaning less work for the cooling fan and
&gt; therefore the motor.

The fan moves a _lot_ of air, so I doubt that the pressure in the
engine bay is positive.  I'd have to set up a manometer to know for
sure, though.  

A vehicle under way tends to have increases pressure under its body,
which is why air dams are popular with the sports car folks.  This
pressure tends to help air under the bus to get back into the engine
bay if the seals are bad or missing.

  The amount of hot air that gets sucked up there is
&gt; negligable when underway, as the exhaust heat is getting blown back
&gt; instead of up.

You'd think that the hot air would be blown straight out the back by
the motion of the bus, but it often doesn't work that way.  Air often
stagnates or even moves in directions you wouldn't expect.  Anyone for
tuft-testing a bus?
