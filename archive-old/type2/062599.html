&gt; &gt;Subject: compressed air
&gt; &gt;After you soak the carb, you're supposed to blow out all the passages with
&gt; compressed air. Problem is, &gt;you guessed it, I have no air compressor.
&gt; Does anyone sell cans of compressed air?
&gt; 
&gt; Bob--
&gt; Cans of compressed air (actually compressed 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane) are
&gt; readily available to clean computers out with.  The stuff is advertised as
&gt; containing no ozone depleting CFCs, and being non-flamable.  The brand name
&gt; of the stuff I use (for the pathetically brand-conscious) is &quot;PerfectData&quot;
&gt; and costs somewhere in the neighborhood of five bucks for a good size can.
&gt; Like WD-40, it's probably a good stock to buy--and for the same reason!
&gt; It's generally available wherever people with pocket protectors hang out.
&gt; 
&gt; On the other hand, air compressors are REALLY NEAT because they allow you to
&gt; buy all kinds of accessory tools--like sand blasters, impact wrenches,
&gt; cut-off wheels, orbital sanders, air chisels, spot blasters, spark plug
&gt; cleaners, paint sprayers, and blow nozzles.  You can also fill your tires in
&gt; the safety and privacy of your own driveway (where permitted by law).
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck with your carb rebuild!!

Yep... and if you really can't afford a compressor, most tool stores 
sell a canister. It's basically the same air tank that's mounted on 
inexpensive compressors, with a guage and a filler nozzle that looks 
like a tire valve.  It has about 6' of hose, with a tire filler 
nozzle and quick release. Simply fill it up... it'll hold up to 100 psi.

They cost about $30, or less, for the smaller size. It's really 
convenient to lug out to the north 40 to fill a tire on the tractor, 
too. One charge will fill a low VW tire. I use it at work to dust out 
PCs. It's cheaper than buying the compressed air. Once I modified a 
nozzle, I can dust out a couple PCs on a single charge.
