In the past few weeks, you have had no bus, a '73 bus you wanted to put a 
1776 upright engine in, and now you have a 1968 with a 1600sp...

I am sure there are many people who would like to help you, but it looks 
as though you are &quot;kicking tires&quot;.

If you have not bought the vehicle yet, it would be better if you said 
something like, &quot;I am considering buying a 1968 bus with a 1600sp.  If I 
bought this bus, I would want to install an oil filter.  What is the best 
way to do this?&quot;

Then someone (like me) might be willing to say that the best way would be 
to have the case machined for full-flow.  The engine should be disassembled 
to do this.  A threaded plug is put in the outlet of the oil pump.  Use a 
full flow oil pump cover, Gene Berg sells a nice one that has a 45 degree 
outlet that will clear the rear hanger for the '68-71 buses for about $35.  
The main oil galley on the case will have to be drilled &amp; tapped to accept 
a fitting to return oil to the case from the oil filter.

The fittings are about $8 a piece, SS covered hose is about $9 a foot, 
the filter mount is about $15, and Fram HP1 filters are about $9.

If you buy the bus and decide to add an oil filter, I would be happy to 
explain how to do the work step-by-step.
