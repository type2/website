Subject: Re: [T2] Re: What type of OIL, question?!

&gt;&lt;&lt; Well, over the weekend I saw a commercial, I think from Pennsoil, for 
&gt;their new SUV oil.  &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I'd be curious as to what would differentiate SUV oil from any other oil
&gt;  
&gt;
It's bigger, more expensive, shinier, sits on the top shelf, looks important, and opresses you.  That's why it's specifically designed for SUVs.  Of course, SUVs are meant to go off road, but they don't, they get driven slowly and carefully over speed bumps and pot holes.  My Bus sees more off-road action than any SUV.  And i think it's relatively unintimidating.  My bus would be mad at me if i put SUV oil in it.
