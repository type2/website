Subject: Lost Brakes... what to check?

Hi,

The other day I lost half my brakes (thank you dual system!!). We knew our
brake warning light wasn't working but we hadn't fixed it yet. (It's fixed
now.) Anyway, we're alive and we tore into the front brakes AGAIN. We didn't
replace what look like the original wheel cylinders or the front brake lines
although the back was completely redone. Since the front was working ok we
figured we'd get it inspected and all that and then replace stuff at our
leisure so we could catch up on some of our 'bus debt.' It still hasn't been
inspected because this brake failure happened a couple of days beforehand.

We looked over the master cylinder.. no evidence of leakage. We took off one
front wheel and found that it was wet under the rubber seals on the wheel
cylinders where it wasn't wet the last time we had looked at it (days before
literally). We ordered new ones for both sides figuring this isn't good.
There are no other obvious signs of leaks anywhere. Any suggestions besides
finishing the brake line replacement also?
