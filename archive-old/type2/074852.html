Subject: RE: wood panels and carbs


Thank you for those of you drawing up the interior panel patterns. I am
planning to make a front headliner for my '70 Westy.  Please add kick panels
too! (I have no old ones).
A few years ago I did the front doors and sliding door.

Question on carbs, I have a Solex progressive that I am setting up for an
1835 Type I (P&amp;C's are surplus, otherwise would not go with 92mm, will
change to thickwall 90.5s/1776 if it melts).

Does anybody have experience with a Solex progressive, who knows what size
main jet to use? I don't know much about carbs.  Or how to tune it?  Is
there a manual for it out there?

Thanks,
Will
