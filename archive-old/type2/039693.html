Mike has just perfectly described typical California driving technique.
Scary, huh? ;-)

Although you did leave out balancing the organizer on the steering wheel.

&gt; chest&quot; between shifting from 2nd to 3rd, pop it open while holding the
&gt; steering wheel with the top of my left leg, my left foot pressing on, but
&gt; not pushing in, the clutch pedal, traverse the freeway on-ramp with left
&gt; pinky (the rest are fondling the chili dog) turning the steering wheel, gulp
&gt; gulp gulp, finish chili dog, start brushing my long mane, open the ash tray
&gt; to get a couple of &quot;poofies&quot; out, do the left knee co-pilot trick whilst
&gt; getting my hair into a pony tail (for all you Yuppies, that's when your hair
&gt; is long enough to sit on, you put a &quot;poofie&quot; in your hair to hold it in
&gt; place - not white glue). Put my face up to the rearview to check for
&gt; extra-length nose hairs (man, they *hurt* when you pull 'em out, don't
&gt; they?), call the office on the cell phone... WHAT!! I'm still in 3rd gear?
&gt; Man. Too busy doing other stuff. Gotta do the other stuff. Shift to 4th.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, I reach into the console one last time, and take out my way cool
&gt; sunglasses, pop 'em on my schnaz, and we are stylin'. Settle back. Hands at
&gt; 9:30 and 2:30. Turn up the stereo. Bob a little (just a little) to the
&gt; tunes.
