&gt; &gt; Does anyone else draft trucks?

&gt; It helps but can irritate the driver if you are too close.

I have in the bug but never in a bus. Haven't had one with the brakes
completely redone so that I'd trust myself doing it properly. If you're
too far back you get some awesome shifting side gusts. Never know which
direction they'll come from.

When I was young and stupid I drafted one truck, with his permission (CB
Radio), about 300 miles when travelling from NE Florida to NE Alabama
through GA up I-75. I set a personal record on that trip of just over 7
miles in neutral at 60 mph. 

I had to stay about 12&quot; to 18&quot; off of the bumper of the semi to keep it
sucking me along. Not reccomended for the faint of heart or slow of
reflex. He'd let me know on the radio if he saw traffic ahead and I'd
drop it into 4th and back off a few feet to where he was just &quot;heping me
along&quot; rather than actually &quot;vaccuum towing&quot; me.

It was late on a Saturday night with no traffic anywhere. I'd just slow
down to about 45 when he had to pull into a weigh station and he'd catch
up and get back in front. I got almost 60mpg on that trip. I probably
only burned 3 or 4 gallons in that 300 mile stretch. I was in neutral
just idleing most of the time. Only had to put it in 4th if we hit a
steep uphill or if I tapped the brake a little too hard on a downhill
and got out of the pocket. He had to continue north to Tennessee when I
needed to head west so I lost my &quot;ride&quot;.
