Paper today had a great article about a VW bus that was loaded with a
&quot;death ray&quot; - for electronics! Large gizmo inside the bus sends out an
electromagnetic pulse, which cooks electronics.
I DO recall many discussions on the Lists a while back along these lines...
a cell-phone zapper, etcetc... we're always ahead of the crowd.

Why put it in a late-70s baywindow?  NO electronic ignition to burn out as
you drive along, destroying computers, phones and onboard VCRs.

It was a Newhouse News Service article, should be online somewhere (our
so-called 'paper' is the Austin American Statesman, if you want to brave
their 'webpage.')
