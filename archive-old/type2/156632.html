A perfect seal isn't needed, but you should minimize the holes between the
engine bay and the region below.

&gt; Are there any other ways to seal up those holes in the tin?

Lots of ways!  Forget duct tape, it will come right off in the heat.  Real
aluminum tape is better, particularly if it is applied to both sides of
the hole.

A more permanent patch is to take two pieces of sheet metal slightly
larger than the hole and sandwich the hole in the middle, securing the
pieces of sheet metal together with a screw or two.  This will yield a
good permanent seal that can be easily undone if you decide to restore
your heating system later on.

It might also be possible to find a rubber plug to pop into the hole.
Best way to do this is to spend a few hours at a pick-your-part wrecking
yard looking under cars for plugs of the appropriate size and shape.  You
might also consult McMaster-Carr.

 Did they ever
&gt; offer a Bus without heat?

Not that I know of, but with VW anything is possible.
