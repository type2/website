Subject: Re: front triangular window

If anyone has a good answer to this please pmail it to me as well.
I have a broken clip to lock the corner window. I went to the San Jose 
PIck_n_pull and there are several bay windows with the appropriate vent 
windows. They are cheap enough and I think I have to pull the whole assembly 
from the door. My manuals do not seem clear as to how to do the replacement, 
but it looks like a disassembly of the whole door assembly.
