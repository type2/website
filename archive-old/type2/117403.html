&gt; Hello All, 
&gt; As you've notice I'm new to the list, I just bought a
&gt; '70 Station Wagon Bus a week ago.(my first bus=;0)
&gt; its all original except the motor, obviously a rebuild
&gt; because it has a mexican case.
&gt; History:

welcome

&gt; The bus sat idle for 7-8 yrs.
&gt; Supposedly it overheated. The boots on the wires were
&gt; fried, so were the tops of some plugs.
&gt; 
&gt; What I've replaced:
&gt; plugs, wires, points, battery, fuel filter.
&gt; 
&gt; Whats the problem:
&gt; I have fuel, and compression now.
&gt; and before I made all my adjustments I HAD SPARK!!
&gt; Now I dont have spark anymore and I cant figure out
&gt; whats going on. I've rechecked all wires to make sure

&gt; Could this be an ignition switch problem at front of
&gt; bus??
&gt; I inspected the switch and it fell apart before I
&gt; could remove it. Could this be the culprit?

yes it is probably the culprit...also check your points and  do you have
power to teh + term at the coil

&gt; is there a way to test start the car without the ign.
&gt; switch? and at the same time run spark to the coil?

yes but it is not something I would do if I was just getting started
