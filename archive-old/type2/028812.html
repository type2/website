&gt; Has anyone heard of this company...A.A. Best Co. from central PA?  He is
&gt; selling replacement pop-top canvases on e*ay, but doesn't have any
&gt; pictures.


Never heard of this company but apparantly their canvas is from the same
people as the one I sell (and the ones sold by Go Westy, West Coast Metric,
Motorworks, and most others; not many people still make poptop canvas).  My
prices are lower, though, with the listmember discount figured in (unless
you luck out on ebay, of course). While I only list gray for '80 up in my
catalog (because that color was not offered on pre-1980), I can certainly
have a gray one made for you for the same price as tan and gold.
