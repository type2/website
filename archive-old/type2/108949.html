Subject: [T2] Aux Battery


&gt; I've been wondering how the original aux battery was set
&gt; up???
&gt; Seems to me optimal would be:
&gt;
&gt; Both batteries charging when running.
&gt; When parked, key off, juice pulled from aux for interior
&gt; lights, sockets, frig, etc.  (Not that I'm gonna use the
&gt; frig on battery, waste o' juice.)
&gt; When running,  juice pulled from main???
&gt;
&gt; Any hints on this would be most appreciated!
&gt;

From the factory the only thing that ran off the aux. battery was the
fridge. Everthing else including the front 12v socket and interior lights
ran off the main battery. I'm with you I would much rather have those things
running off the aux. battery. Make sure that both fuses are good to the
control panel. Theres one in the panel itself and an inline to the fridge in
the engine compartment.
