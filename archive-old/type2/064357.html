Subject: SIR impressions

Greetings all,

I just recieved an order I placed with SIR for a 40 horse I'm building, and
my initial impressions, without having miked everthing yet, are quite good.
 After having marginal luck w/GEX and rotten luck w/MOFOCO this is a
welcome relief.

Suprisingly, they sent Kolbenschmidt main bearings and German gaskets.

On the down side, they sent the wrong DIRTY oil cooler.  As the other parts
appear to be first rate, they get the benefit of the doubt.  I expect that
they will be as horified about the dirt in there as I am and replace it
promptly.  

On Thursday I'll be able to check everything properly and will report back
if anything is out of specs.

Oh, another plus for SIR is that they were able track down a freight
company that would take small orders (108 lbs) via ground to Alaska.  This
is a feat that other suppliers have been unwilling and/or unable to
perform.  (UPS gets about $200 to bring me an engine kit!)
