Well, if it's free, why not go for something exotic? In the 
candy-colors, there's a candy-yellow that's always caught my eye. It 
starts w/ a mild metal flake (very subtle), covered by a transparent 
tweety-bird yellow. That color, or the burnt orange, are colors I'd love 
to apply to a vehicle... but have never found the right car to apply it 
to.

Or you could go w/ the color a friend of mine applied to his brother's 
'66 Chevy. The car was originally red, but we repainted it metalic 
purple (and this was YEARS before anyone ever put purple on a car). The 
main problem was the red interior. &lt;grin&gt;
