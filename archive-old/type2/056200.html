Subject: '72 timing marks

Hello,

My tune-up plans were thwarted this weekend by the sudden realization that
there are no discernible timing marks on the crank/fan pulley of the bus:'72
type IV engine 009 diz. The timing scale is intact and there is a nice
centerline on the fan housing but nothing visible on the pulley that looks
remotely like the  two timing marks that are alluded to in the &quot;idiot book.&quot;
I removed the plastic cap on top of the fan housing as suggested by Muir but
this only revealed a dark and dirty place where the other side of the fan
lives. Am I missing something obvious?

A search of the &quot;arkvibes&quot; produced a lot of info on timing and there is a
great article by Mr.. Hoover about how to find TDC. I may have to do it the
Hoover way but I want to be sure that I am not missing some obvious timing
marks.

Thanks
Chris
