Subject: Re: CD Player in Buses

I don't see whay the angle would make any difference.  I don't have a CD
player (barely have a tape player) in my bus, so I can;t say for sure, but
I think he was full of it.  As long as that body of the player is properly
supported, with no undue stresses on the case, it should be fine.  There
isn't any reason gravity would affect the play of a CD.

Now, the smoothness of the ride will make a difference. II've considered a
CD player, but figured the ride is too rough.  How well does yours work?
Any problem with skipping?
