&lt;&lt; I have some aluminum sheet and might see about making some sort of added 
shield after I extend the dumps and see if it makes a difference.

I have added some aluminum shielding on a bug and had it make a 100 degree 
lower difference in the temp of the std sheet metal 3 inches away.

The local plumbing supply house should have cheap shields for sweating
pipe in tight spaces...Sandwich a few inside the sheet metal for extra
heat shielding (Mine has a few pre-law asbestos-lined trivets... ;-)
