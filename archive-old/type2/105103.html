Subject: Westy cabinet tee- molding

I just noticed GoWesty! has replacement tee-molding for the cabinets and compartments.

I bought a small strip with my last order to check it out and it's a very very close match for the original stuff. It's $1.25/ft. which is a lot more that what you can expect to pay if you scrounge around the junkyards but it's new and more flexible.
