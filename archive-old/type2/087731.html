Subject: Re: [T2] 205E distributor vacuum canister failure

Beware: almost all rebuilders lump a dozen or so vehicles under one
application.
In your case, only the 72 1700 and 73 auto trans 1700 used the same vacuum
unit. However, the centrifugal advance between the 205E and the 205F where
different:

Here is the E:   Timing Set At: 10deg ATDC _at_ 800-950rpm w/strobe, vacuum
hose(s) connected
Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 7-12deg Adv, 16-18deg Ret; Centrifugal: 9-14deg
_at_ 2000rpm, 21-25deg _at_ 3400 rpm

Here is the F:  Timing Set At:: 5deg ATDC _at_ 800-950rpm w/strobe, vacuum
hose(s) connected
Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 8-12deg Adv, 11-14deg Ret; Centrifugal: 14deg _at_
1700 rpm, 15-19deg _at_ 2400 rpm, 21-25deg _at_ 3400rpm

The difference was when centrifugal started to come in.
[I do not not have a clue as to why the specs for the vac are different when
the vacuum unit is the same!?!?!]

You might want to make a list of all the vehicles the rebuilder says it fits
and then compare the specs of the original curve. Go here to get the specs:

There is no 'one size fits all'..... VW had Bosch build different distributors
with different advance curves for a reason.




&gt; Yes, it is the 205E dual vacuum distributor for my '72 dual solex 1700 cc
&gt; bus.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for the details.
&gt;
&gt; Advance auto parts web site lists a rebuilt distributor as well as on other
&gt; place on-line that I have found.  Maybe I buy a complete distributor.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am assuming this is a 021 905 205E for a 72 bus?  [not a 211 905 205E
for a
&gt; &gt; 49 - 12/53 bug and 2/55 - 59 bus] Since you did say it has a dual vacuum
&gt; &gt; unit.......
&gt; &gt; Then you should have 885 on the arm of the vac unit?
&gt; &gt; This unit only fits 72 1700 and 73 1700 auto trans engines. Dist # 021 905
&gt; &gt; 205E (0 231 173 005) and 021 905 208F (0 231 173 007).
&gt; &gt; Jim's dizzy sight also says 021 905 205Q (0231 173 008) but that number
does
&gt; &gt; not appear anywhere else.....
&gt; &gt; The short Bosch number for the 885 vac unit is 07 101. The long number is
1
&gt; &gt; 237 121 885. Good luck finding one.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Anyone know where to find a replacement vacuum canister for a 205E dual
&gt; &gt;&gt; vacuum distributor?  Mine is leaking on the retard side.  I have plugged
the
&gt; &gt;&gt; retard line and it seems to run okay like that, but I want to replace the
&gt; &gt;&gt; canister, is this available anywhere, or am I headed for the boneyard?
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Thanks,
