Subject: Re: [T2] Type two truck heater

Rus asked:


I was wondering if anyone could shed some light on
type two truck and the heaters for them, like where
did they go, what kind did they use etc, as i just got
a single cab. Any help would be great

I put the VW heating book up here:
http://failsure_dot_net/oacdp/ebersp.html

The type II section shows you the heater and how to test it and mount it in your vehicle.
