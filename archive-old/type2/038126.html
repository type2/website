Tony,

This info was transmitted exactly as received. Royce is a wonderful guy, and
what I have seen of his Bus it is very nice, too. If I remember correctly,
it is a late 70's  newly painted metallic silver or bronze and is in pretty
good shape interior wise. For more Info, contact the originator,

&gt; It would help immensely if you would include info as to which bus and
where
&gt; it/you are.
