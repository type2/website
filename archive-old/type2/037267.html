Subject: Heat

I have some questions about heat. I am not
worried about the stock heating system as I have
made many improvments in the past to other
busses. What I was wondering is, have any of you
installed a catalitic(sp?) type heater? The kind
I was looking at was at a RV supply store. It is
about 4in thick and would mount in a wall or
cabinet. It is powered by Propane. It needs no
exhaust and no power supply. Its use would not be
for driving, but for camping. If I did the
installation my self it would run round $400-$500
for heater, tank and misc parts. I like to old
gas heaters, but they are all old, parts are not
cheap, no repair shop close by that can fix them,
and they are big $$$ for a good working one. The
other thing is that the gas heater would require
a 12v power supply. 
  I would be putting it into a 74 Kombi(not yet a
camper). So when I make it into a camper I will
just provide a spot for it. It will be a summer
project and would love to hear from anyone that
has installed one like it in the Bus. 
  Also, anyone have a used propane tank for sale?
I have seen them on Westies and other
convertions, and am told I can get a new one for
around $120.
