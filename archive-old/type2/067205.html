Subject: Re: Gas Heaters According to Kath  :-)

&gt;On another weird note, an '86 German manual I have shows the aux
&gt;gas heater with real neat, DIGITAL controls (just a timer I think
&gt;though, not a thermostat system), anybody ever see this system on
&gt;a van, seems cool they finally got a bit more up to date than that
&gt;big green TEMP knob.  Anyway Tom F. is getting the manual translated
&gt;so maybe we'll find out more.  It also shows the German 2 and 3 diff
&gt;lock Syncro systems should be interesting.

This digital control panel is also covered (and pictured) in the Vanagon 
Bentley manual. As I recall, it is part of the gas heater setup that was 
available as an option on water-cooled Vanagons sold in Canada.
