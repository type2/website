I have that same switch,, and I use my foot with it all the time...
although my switch does not have that protection collar on it..

I usually stand on the large rubber boot with one foot.. and tap the large
button part of the switch with my other foot.... instead of gas pedal action,,

&gt; Has anyone seen one of these remote starter switches that can be operated by
foot (or knee in the case of VW)? It would be nice to be able to turn the engine
over and still have two hands free..
