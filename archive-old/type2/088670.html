Subject: Re: [T2] I guess it's not wrong after all

Thank you, Mike. I bookmarked that. I was also suspicious about the
practicality of anything that has such a high acceleration in second gear.
When you have this tranny re-geared, are you doing the work yourself or
having it done for you? I'd like to know how that works out.
Right now I am considering having a transmission rebuilt with two 3rd and
4th gears from a Vanagon just for the '71 transporter/Westphalia conversion.
But I have to admit that I am sorely tempted by the thought of a 5th gear.
Thanks for sharing this, and congratulations on your success! Jan B
