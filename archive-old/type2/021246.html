Steve, et al:

Point your browser to
&lt;http://greenmini.mrbean_dot_net.au/~rover/ketterin.htm&gt; for a thorough
description of how a Kettering ignition system works.  Like the Rzeppa
in our CV joints, one only has to know the 'keyword' to find anything
you want on the net. In this case, the keyword is that genius engineer,
an engineer's engineer, Charles Kettering. (Who also gave us things like
cars in colors other than black, self-starters, automobile radios and
other such items that have since become indespensible. A most
interesting individual...)
