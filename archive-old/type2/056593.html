Sally:

I hope someone else will correct me if I'm mistaken, but I've never
heard of a Champagne Edition Westy.

My '78 7-passenger is one, and it's Badger Brown and Fox Red.  It came
with polished bumpers, tinted glass, carpeting, and vinyl/corduroy
seating surfaces.  75 amp alternator and auxiliary gas heater plus
booster blower through the heat exchangers.  Stainless outside mirrors. 
Padded vinyl covered dash with clock.  I *think* that's all that made it
a &quot;Champagne Edition&quot;.
