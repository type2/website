All this talk about Bus Depot not coming through made me wonder about my
own order that I placed on Monday.  This was a first time order with these
folks; I usually use RMMW or WW.  Seeing as how this is my first bus and
Bus Depot has had some good things said about them, I wanted to give them a
try.

As I said, on Monday I ordered an exhaust system, seat cushions, a bunch of
tune-up parts and other miscellaneous stuff like seals.  The seat cushions
and exhaust system were not in stock, but was told it would be in later in
the week and I would have it the middle of next week.  OK, I can live with
that.  But, I specifically asked that the rest be shipped separately that
day 'cause I needed it for Saturday's scheduled work.  The order person
acknowledged that and I was happy knowing I had saved some bucks and would
be in business for Saturday.

Fast forward to today and the list discussion on this topic.  I arrived
home to find no package on my doorstep.  Surely in 4 days it should have
arrived.  Now I'm beginning to think the same thing has befell me.  I
called Bus depot, inquired if my order had been shipped and was told they
were waiting for the exhaust to arrive to ship the entire order. 
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!AGGGGHHHHH!!!!!  I see a pattern developing here.

They said they were not aware that I wanted the stuff shipped separately
and offered to send it express, splitting the cost with me.  This would not
really do me any good as the earliest I would have it would be Saturday
afternoon which would kind of waste my whole day.

So, I cancelled the order.  I put my trust in Bus Depot and they let me
down.  RMMW, here I come.

i have had similar problems with the bus depot, nothing ever seem to came and 
when i never really figured why nothing was coming, i told them to ship out 
what they had and to send out the seat covers as soon as they could.  i got 
it all at one time with an enormous delay, like 2 weeks,  i really didnt care 
enough because i wasnt driving this van anyways so i didnt make any deal of 
it.  i do understand that this type of business is kind of unreliable, but 
the prices are much better than any other company.
