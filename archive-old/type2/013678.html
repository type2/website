Hi All,

I am posting this for my mechanic - Lou at Lou's VW. Please direct any questions to him at 818-345-6774. I will tell you what I have been told and/or have seen....

The subject bus is in good mechanical condition. Lou says that it runs well. I looked at the engine and noted that it is missing the engine compartment seal.

The bus needs a complete interior - seats, headliner, etc. Some stuff is missing, some is worn out, etc. The tires look old and should be replaced.

Other than that, it is in good shape. The body, especially is in very good condition. Very straight with &quot;no&quot; rust. Note the quotes on that. I looked at the cargo area and there is some light rust, but nothing that goes all the way through. I did not see any other rust on it. I beleive this is a deluxe walkthrough as it has the chrome trim around the outside of the bus. Lou's comment to me was that he was saving the bus because of the great condition of the body.

Lou is a good guy who I have known for a long time. I'm sure that he will answer any questions that you might have and would appreciate the bus going to a good home. You can get him at 818-345-6774 beteen about 9am and 5pm pacific.

Good luck!

Mark
