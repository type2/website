&gt; My '78 2.0L fuel injected Bus won't start.  It turns over, fires, runs for
&gt; two seconds then dies.  If I give it gas it will idle high for ~6 seconds
&gt; and then will die independent of my right foot.  It has gas in the tank.
&gt; I can repeat this indefinitely.
	[] Another thing to check for is major vacuum leaks. Mine once
backfired, and blew the decel valve off.
	When this happens, it is getting too much air, and is way too lean
to run EXCEPT during initial starting
	when the cold start valve is adding the extra gas. This is most
likely if you've been messing with it.
	How I found it was just as it died I heard a Whoosh-hoosh -
Whoosh-hoosh sound which was the last piston
	sucking air, and then blowing back just as it stopped
