Subject: Fuel Lines Replacement (Long!)

Here is all the information I have been saving to change my
fuel lines ,it is long and somewhat redundant but hope it
helps everyone. I will be doing this this weekend if weather
permits. I have said I would do this before, but I cannot sit on
this problem anymore.
Tobin Copely wrote: After a rash of &quot;burning bus&quot; stories, I
finally buckled down and replaced all the fuel lines in my
1976 bus, determined not to let my bus meet its end as a
result of old, cracked, or loose fuel lines.  It wasn't all that
hard.  And to make it really easy for you, I'll tell you exactly
what you need, and how to do it.

Do yourself a favour, and replace the fuel lines in your bus
this weekend.
It might save your bus.  And it might save you or someone in
your family from getting hurt.

Caveats:
- --------
I'm not a professionally-trained mechanic.  Don't trust me
blindly here.
If something seems odd or potentially hazardous, stop and
think about it.
Use your head: you're working with gasoline.
This is the procedure for a stock 1976 fuel-injected 2.0L bus. 
It should be pretty much the same for all 1975 - 1979 buses. 
1980 - 1983 1/2 air-cooled Vanagons are likely very close,
with the exception of a different fuel tank location, so you'll
need more fuel line.  Water-pumper
Vanagons are probably pretty similar to what I describe, but
again, you'll need more fuel line.  Eurovans are, of course,
completely different.
This procedure will replace the fuel lines.  Filler neck and
other gas-fume sources are not covered here, so if fumes
persist after doing this procedure, keep looking for the source
of the smell.  Do not ignore gas fumes.

Stuff you will need:
- --------------------
A fire extinguisher.  Don't even think of starting this job
without one right beside you at all times.  Don't get casual
with gasoline--there are more than a few list members with
sad stories of buses that burned while they were working on
them.  I know at least one that nearly lost his house in the
process.

A set of jack stands if you're not skinny enough to easily
crawl around under the bus without raising the vehicle.  I
don't need 'em, but then again I could stand to put on a few
pounds.  Do not work under a bus that is jacked up without
jackstands!!

A good-sized (say, 6 gallon) jerry can.

A trouble lamp or small flashlight.

A pair of vise-grips.

WD-40, rags, goggles, grubby clothes, handcleaner, and all
the usual wonderful acutrements for working on cars.

10' of 5/16&quot; high-pressure fuel infection fuel line.  Be sure you
   get high pressure line!!
1' of 1/2&quot; fuel line.  You don't need high pressure line, but I
   used high pressure line anyway.
Lots of small (#4) hose clamps.  You'll need at least 21. 
These
   are for the 5/16&quot; line, so check them out for fit with the
   hose before you leave your FLAPS.
2 hose clamps the next size up for the 1/2&quot; hose.
A 1/4&quot; open/box-ended wrench so you can get at the hose
clamps
  sideways easily.
A set of seals for the fuel injectors.  You will need one large
  and one small seal for each injector.  I didn't replace the
one
  for my cold-start injector, so I don't know if it's any
  different from the others.  I got a set for the 4 injectors for
  $8.00 CDN from my friendly mechanic (Vancouver West
Motors in
  Vancouver, and yes, that's a shameless plug.)
A variety of flat-head screw drivers.
A phillips head screw driver for the clamp holding the air filter
   housing to the air intake sensor.
A 10mm wrench for the nuts holding the fuel injectors to the
  intake manifold.
Splurge and get yourself a new fuel filter.

Procedure:
- ----------
You'll want to do this with only a few gallons of gas in the
tank.
Find a dry, level, well-ventilated place to park the bus.  Give
yourself the day to do the job, so you won't feel rushed.

1) Aquaint yourself with the situation:
Get under the bus and find the fuel pump and filter.  They'll
be on the left side of the bus, just forward of the rear wheel. 
Follow the fuel line from the filter, back over the transmission,
and up to the underside of the fuel tank just to the right of the
transmission.  There are two fuel lines attached to the tank,
see?  One goes to the fuel filter and pump, the other is the
return line from the motor.  The fuel system is a loop, so
unused fuel gets put back in to the fuel tank via the return
line.  Go back to look at the pump.  Notice that the hose
used to connect the filter to the pump is bigger than the rest.
 Follow the line from the pump back towards the engine.  It
disappears through the firewall on the left side of the engine
compartment.  Get up and go to the back of the bus.
   Remove the air cleaner.  The rear part of it just pops off
with a system of clips--it's quite simple, so I won't explain it
here.  Remove the air cleaner snorkel from the air intake
sensor by loosening the phillips head clamp that holds it on. 
Set all the air cleaner stuff aside.
   Remove the engine compartment cover, and look inside.
   On the far outsides of the motor, nearly on the bottom of
the engine compartment, are some fuel hoses that connect
to a metal tubing piece, and that run to the injectors (the
things with the blue push-on plugs attached to them).  On
the rear end of these metal tubes, a fuel hose runs up to the
center rear of the engine (to the cold-start injector), then over
to the other side, where it attaches to the rear end of a tube
on the opposite side.  This ring of fuel lines around the
engine is called the &quot;ring main&quot; or fuel ring.  The fuel enters
the engine compartment through the left side of the engine
compartment, and leaves out the right side, after passing
through the fuel pressure regulator on the right side firewall. 
Quiz: where does the hose forward of the fuel pressure
regulator lead to?  Right: it goes directly to the fuel tank,
where it returns unused fuel to the tank.  You saw that hose
when you were under the bus, remember?
  That's all there is to it.  Now that you know the geography,
you can get to work.

2) Drain fuel from the vehicle.
Get out your fire extinguisher, jerry can, rags, and vice grips.
Disconnect the battery.  Get under the bus, and put a
vise-grip on the fuel line just upstream from the fuel filter to
pinch it closed.  Loosen the clamp on the fuel filter.  Remove
the hose: careful!  Some gas will spill out from the filter end,
but it shouldn't be much.  Keep it off your skin with the rags. 
You'll have a little trapped gas spill from most of the
connections you undo, so get used to it.  Get the jerry can
open and under the bus next to the line from the gas tank. 
Put the end of the hose into the jerry can, and check that
everything is ready.  Ready?  Remove the vise-grips from the
fuel line.  Your tank will empty into the jerry can.
Get away from it a bit while it's draining--the fumes are bad
for you.
Done?  Cap the jerry can and put it aside.  You'll pour the
gas back into the bus when you're done.

3) Start swapping old fuel line for new:
This is easy.  Do all the lines under the bus first, before
moving to the engive compartment.  Loosen the clamps,
remove the line, use the old line to measure where to cut the
new line to length, and re-install with new clamps.  Get them
good and tight.  There are some clips under the bus to hold
some sections of line up against the underbody: look for
them and use them.  Do each piece one at a time so you
don't get confused.  Now's a good time to replace your fuel
filter--just pop it in when you're replacing that section.  Use
the bigger hose clamps for the big hose connecting the filter
to the pump.  If a hose won't come off, try twisting it to break
it free, or lever the end with a wide screwdriver.

4) Move to the engine compartment:
Many of the lines in the engine compartment are very short,
and new fuel line is pretty stiff.  It's easiest to loosen all the
fuel line clamps at once, and remove the metal fuel tubes
from each side of the ring main as units.  You can pull of the
old lines and clamp on new ones with the tubes out of the
car.  If you're replacing fuel injector seals at this point, pop off
the blue electrical connections for each injector (remember
which one is which!), and undo the 10mm nuts holding each
injector in place.
*Carefully* pull the injectors straight out of their holes.  Do
not bang them on the sides of the hole, and keep them from
picking up dirt.  You can remove the each side's injectors
and metal fuel ring all as one piece if you want to be clever.
Replace all the fuel lines, replace injector seals, clean
everything up, and reinstall.
   Check that the fuel line going through the firewall on the left
side has a good rubber grommet protecting it from chafing. 
You may well want to take the time to fabricate a bulkhead
fitting as described by Bob Hoover on his &quot;Sermons of Bob
Hoover&quot; page.
   Double and triple check all the fuel line connections.  Good
and tight?
Properly positioned?  No fuel lines cut too short, binding,
resting on parts of the motor or tranny that will get hot, or
otherwise potentially hazardous?  Are all the electrical
connections back on in the proper configuration?  Are you
sure?  Are you really, really sure?  Check everything.  It's
your bus.

5) Start it up:
Reconnect your battery.  Pour the gas you stored in the jerry
can back into the gas tank.  Wait a few minutes.  Crawl
under the bus again and check for leaks, wet connections,
anything.

Get in and fire up the bus for 5 or 10 seconds of so.  Shut it
off.  Go back and check for leaks, wet connections, etc.  If
everything's OK, put the air cleaner back on.  Don't forget to
put the two air hoses back on to the air cleaner.  If it's
missing, check electrical connections--is everything plugged
back in and secure?

That's it!  Sniff around the engine a bit for the first few days to
make sure everything's happy.  Give your bus a bath as an
extra treat.

See?  Wasn't that hard, was it?

&gt;From MICHAEL G BENTHIN
Patrick Flynn inquired about repairing a leaky filler tube to
gas tank.
The tube actually consists of 3 parts- a plastic flange with
screws around it, what you see when you take cap off, which
is clamped to a metal tube about 1.5 ft., and a rubber
connector about 4 or 5&quot; long which is hoseclamped to the
tank.  The latter can crack and eventually leak- I too had gas
&quot;smells&quot; when tank was filled too high or when making left
turns, and took the opportunity to check it out when I pulled
engine to replace clutch disk- The cover to tank compartment
had screws that were impossible to reach when engine was
in car, and I left them out when cover was replaced.  Before
trying to remove the rubber connector I checked dealer-
$90 for a stupid piece of fat hose, and had no time to wait, so
I took a piece of tin can cut to allow an overlap on itself;
glopped it up with silicone, and clamped it over the rubber
connector with plenty more silicone.  Works pretty well with
filling tank; still some smell with hard lefts, so I don't totally
fill the tank, especially after first &quot;click&quot; of pump. To replace
the hose, you probably have to dissconect the flan ge at the
top, allowing tube to be &quot;lifted&quot; so lower rubber hose can be
slipped over tank and end of filler pipe. 
From Glen Buhlmann
I had a gas smell when cornering with a relatively full tank in
my 77.  So I replaced  this boot since it was cracked.  This
reduced the problem but didn't solve it.  There  is also a
rubber elbow (about 4&quot; long with a slight bend in it) halfway
down the filler  tube which was also cracked and leaking. 
VW says that this is a &quot;very specailized  part&quot; with a &quot;very
specific bend&quot; and therefore they want something like
$150CDN for it  and it must be ordered from Germany which
would take 6 weeks.  So I got a half decent  one from a
junkyard which is starting to crack but is so far airtight.  To
replace it  my mechanic cut a hole under the bed (you might
be able to get in from the round access  plate in the engine
compartment if you were quite nimble and possibly removed
some  equipment -- but I don't know how your 75 is set up so
I'll lelave that to you) and  then riveted/siliconed in back and
covered it with duct tape (you know the stuff that  holds the
universe together).

Well, that's my story.  Don't know how relevent it is to you
and I guess you probably  won't know either until you replace
your boot and go for a drive with a full tank.

&gt;From sean bartnik
You do not have to remove the engine to remove the firewall. 
I had to do this on my '78.  Basically if you have fuel
injection, move all the crap off the firewall and remove the
intake air box and hose, then undo the screws that hold the
firewall in (there are two under the bus).  Pull it back.  I didn't
remove mine all the way, just pulled it back enough to get in,
no problem.  This gives you access to the elbow which joins
the filler neck and tank.  This also gives you access to the
vent system connections, four of which are in there and are
that VW fabric-covered hose, 7mm diameter.  Replace these,
they can cause stinkies.  To get at the rubber bit at the top
of the filler neck, where the gas cap is, you will have to pry
out that black circular plate on the right side of the engine
compartment and reach up there.  I've not done that so don't
ask me for specifics.  On the tank, you will be able to see
where gas has been leaking as it leaves tracks in the dust.

It's not a hard procedure, just set aside a day for it.
From Bob Hufford
I was able to replace both of the rubber components to the
filler neck  tube with the engine in ('77 Bus).  You can remove
the upper screws/bolts to  the gas tank compartment cover
and move the top back a couple of  inches.  You will need to
pry off the circular access plate (next to the  brain).  It helps
if you practice yoga regularly, but it *can* be done.

Also check the t-connector at the top of the engine
compartment (where  the lines from the condensor tubes
meet to send the fumes to the charcoal  cannister.  If this is
bad, it can also contribute to the gas odor.

&gt;We tried BusBoys today and they had the rubber boot at
the top of the filler
&gt;neck (that part going to The Bug Shop in Vancouver is for
me by the way Jim) but not this elbow.
From H. Steven Dolan
Hi Glen -
Your's is not the first request for this item, we've had a ton of
'em.  And of course, every used one we've found as well has
cracks forming on it as, which would be expected after 15 to
24 years of use and exposure.  No dealer in the USA is even
stocking them anymore, so we're working on getting 'em
direct outa Europe if possible.  I've even gotta feeler working
in Mexico to see if they're the same on the Buses made
down there and if we can get some up here to keep the costs
down (about $80US for this piece of hose if I have to get 'em
outa Germany!).  We'll keep you &amp; the list posted.  BTW this
hose fits 72-79's.
From my experience in switching the '79 FI tank into the '73
non-FI body, the filled neck *on the tank* is in the same
place, but the filler on the body changed between those
years.  The '79 had the filler perpendicular to and flush with
the body, the '73 has the filler behind a door and vertical.
I don't think the same hose will fit both applications.  Also,
as I said to
Glen in a private post previously, while I have not (yet)
experienced this cracking problem firsthand, I looked at my
hoses with a previous series of
&quot;gas fume&quot; posts in mind, and decided that, if it became a
problem for me that I would try the following:

Remove filler tube and clean it;

Get a tube of the &quot;25-year&quot; silicon caulk and squeeze a big
messy handfull onto my hand;

Have someone hand me the tube;

Work that caulk all over the outer surface and into the
cracks.
From John Anderson
Has anyone else considered this?  Tried it?  Did it work?
GO NOW to your local GATES rubber belt/hose dealer.

He can get 57mm (2.25&quot;) fuel/oil hose in two types
One is wire reinforced, one is not, likely about
$10 and $5 the foot, you may have to buy 3 ft.  Now
I unfortunately got the wire reinforced type for the
'78 because he had it on hand.  It is a bit too stiff to make
the bend easily as it is not bent hose like origional, still it
does an OK job, in fact I got 2.5&quot; left if anyone wants but
really you would do better to seek out the stuff without wire. 
I fear the wire reinforced is putting too great a strain on my
other filler elbow on the body.
I also note, a lot of rubbers do not resist alcohol and
gasoline, make SURE you get hose that does, specifically
made for gas/oil.  FI Gates and most others also sell hose
that looks exactly the same for big diesel truck cooling
systems, rubber formulation is different, gas goes right
through it after a few months.  I will not swear to this but I
feel good ole Buna-Nitrile Rubber is the most common gas
resistant rubber.
Happy Hunting

a couple of things, make sur you get quality German
injection rated hose,
RMMW is a good source for the fuel lines (I'm assuming its
still injected).
And replace every little bit to and from the tank, all along the
ring main,
AND the bits on the injectors.  These will come off although
ferrule clamped on, you can remove each injector, cut
diagonally across the ferrule with a hacksaw just into the
hose, peel the ferrule off with pliers then remove hose from
barbed stem on injector, use new stainless clamps all round
the ring main and on injectors when replacing.

Now for the tank.  It is quite accessible with the engine in but
you must dissasemble all the air intake f.i. stuff etc, just
down to the air distributor only left, take everything off that
firewall.  6-8 screws in the engine compartment on the edges
then 2-4 from BELOW up above the heat exchangers
acessed through the tranny subframe go into the bottom lip
of the firewall.  Remove all then take a couple of putty knives
and lever out the top edge of the firewall and remove
carefully.  Acess readily apparent to the 57mm stuff on tank
(like I said Gates without wire a good choice, make sure its
for GAS)  Do all the vent lines as well
(little joints).  To get to the elbow on the body, pull the f.i.
computer and then pop out black plug over it in the body. 
Screws remove the boot, get one from
Bus Boys, if they ever get you a damn catalog.
