Subject: Re: [T2] Re:[T2] Backwards dist. drive (was: George Lyle--He de man.)

Robert I totally lied.  Well actually I read my post about 10 times before 
sending and I still brain farted until after I sent it.  I did not pull the 
dist drive off!!!!  What I did was: after I pulled the dist. off, I turned 
the engine 180 degress and then reseated the dist because I could not pull 
the dist drive.  Sorry for hitting send before my brain connected.  There 
must be a special tool for pulling the dist drive because it was not obvios 
to me and the &quot;obvious&quot; solution at the time was to turn the whole engine 
'cause I couldn't turn the dist drive.

I remember the day I bought my camper very clearly now and how frustrated I 
had gotten when it would not start up at first.  Just take me out back and 
shoot me.  Sorry.
