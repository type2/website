&gt; Last night I had an experience with it which I thought interesting. For the

this is a common problem, there is a vent tube that runs from your tank to
up in the air intake, a small fitting above the battery has probably
broken or is leaking, again very common, next to impossible to see, but
feel around up in the air intake above the battery.  replace the fitting
with a piece of tubeing and you should be fine.

&gt; the sound of two loud backfires, several seconds apart. What amazed me was
&gt; that the sounds came from my BN4!  My uneducated guess is that gas fumes
&gt; accumulated under the intake pipe, were drawn into the hot combustion
&gt; chamber and exploded. I have yet to turn the heater back on.  I have,
&gt; however, become familiar with the workings of my fire extinguisher.

probably what happened, fortunately the design of the gas heaters is such
that you probably did no damage to the heater other than scaring you half
to death

good to be familiar with your fire ex though
