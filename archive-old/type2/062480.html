Subject: seat clamps, front end lube, '78

My 78 bus was purchased with no/little interior, mismatched/missing
seats, and no seat hold-down clamps/bolts/nuts.

I got some seat hold-down clamps and a middle seat from the 79 that
Steve Dolan parted.  [So, presumably the hold-down clamps are from the
middle seat.]

I used those hold-down clamps/bolts on the rear seat, and it's NOT
held down.  It's loose.  Are the hold-down clamps for the rear seat
a different height from those for the middle seat?  If not, why don't
they grab the legs of the rear seat?

Also, I did a front end lube this weekend, it required a whole 14oz
tube of grease.  Is that normal, or could I assume that it had not
been done for a while?

Thanks for any insight,
Rodney
