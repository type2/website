Hi all,

Well, this weekend I was planning on doing my first ever tune-up.  I set out
with books and tools.  First, I did the valve adjustment.  It went amazingly
well.  I don't think there were any problems at all.  Had no problem lining up
the engine (which was stone cold) got the covers off, and found that each of
the valves was just a tiny bit more than .006.  I adjusted them  no problem.
Started her up and drove her, she ran just fine.  Next, I was moving on to set
the points.  Hooked up my brand new tach-dwell meter and started her.  I was
getting about 23 degrees on the 8 cyl. scale, which I translated to 46.
According to Muir, the points were too far open.  So, I opened the distributor
cap, and sure enough the .016 blade was very loose in there.  This is where
the problems began.  I took the screwdriver and tried to loosen the adjustment
screw which as Muir worns was very tight.  Finally it popped loose, and the
whole plate shifted suddenly.  This caused the wire that goes from the vacuum
plate to the inside wall of the distirbutor ( I guess to the condensor) to
break in the middle and come competely off the plate.  So, I pulled the whole
thing out of the engine and put it on the work bench and spent the remainder
of my weekend trying unsuccessfully to solder a new wire into there.  I
couldn't get it at all.  My question is can this be repaired?  If I take it
into a shop can they stick a new wire in there?  Is it worth it?  Or should I
just buy a new distributor?  I've read through the archives and found a lot
about distributors but not this particular problem.  If I should get a new
one, which one?  I know there's been a whole lot said on here about this (i.e.
.009s vs. .005 and brands etc.) but I'd appreciate some advice, you can just
p-mail me. 

Thanks,
