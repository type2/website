Subject: Re: [T2] &quot;Tune-up's&quot; was:Horsepower question

*I must have at least a half dozen millionairs who bring their 30+ year
old
Mercedes to me to continue the maintenance they have insisted upon
through
the years since they bought it new,*

From 1960 through 1992 I was involved in very aggressive self employment
in construction, computers, marketing and real estate development
projects.

My mind set was *automobiles are a tool of my trade*, run them hard, sell
them off and keep going.
I never intended to not perform maintenance on these cars but with the
extended warranties it was an open avenue for neglect.
By the time my Detroit Iron got 50K on them they were suffering from
multiple neglect symptoms and with tax depreciation and interest
deductions I had myself convinced that I was operating in a intelligent
manner.

In reality the Detroit Iron just did not have enough redeeming qualities
to make me consider long term ownership and since the maintenance
diagnostics required tied me to the new car dealership and I truly hated
to ever be at the mercy of those guys after the warranty period.

I can't say that I've ever had an indispensable vehicle before I started
driving my Westfalia seven years ago.

The guys at the Oldsmobile dealership are very surprised to see me drive
into the service writers bay in my 86 Olds wagon. They don't rush to my
aid like they did when I was buying a new car every year. Get this.... I
get free oil changes with filters for as long as I own the car. So I save
about 10$ on an oil change, grease job and general inspection that
refills my brake reservoir, wiper washer bottle, airs up my tires. They
normally come back with about six additional service recommendations that
I ignore. By some strange fluke GM produced one vehicle that has been
generally free of faults for my entire ownership time of 15 years. I just
use the car to pull an Air stream trailer and haul plywood for my home
repair and farm projects. Cash value of this car is about 600$. The spedo
registers 168K, about half of what I have on my Westy and I wouldn't
hesitate to get in this 86 Olds tomorrow and drive it to Alaska from
Dallas TX.

My older brother has a Lexus that nearly qualifies as a lemon.
My younger brother has a Mercedes (non turbo) Diesel 1989 model with 252K
on it and its still going strong, his secret *proper care*.
