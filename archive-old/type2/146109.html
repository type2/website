Subject: luggage rack mounts

Hello All,
I have a 72 Westy (racks at rear). I was wondering if anyone on the list ever
had to replace the bhockey puckb rubbers, which support the luggage racks.
They are sort of a gasket (they look like shock mounts).  There are two
different sizes.  Mine are dry rotted.  During the winter I get a continuos
leak
into the cabin from the slow melting snow.  Does any one where I can purchase
these.  Or might anyone know of a common item that can be used to make them.
Any
help would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Dino Spentzos
Newport, RI
