&gt; &gt;Be careful with prying the engine off of the tranny.  The input shaft

&gt; I understand there's nothing but a circlip holding it? Is that right?
&gt; Tonight that circlip withstood me and Joe prying on the moustache bar,
&gt; wedging against the frame members, me with a 5-foot pipe and him with a
&gt; crowbar. Nothing gave though.

       Having pulled the input shaft out twice, it's not that big of a deal to
fix, you just shove it back in, and play with it until it re-engages. It'll
stay in place until you pull the engine the next time. 8-)
       Or you can just unbolt the bellhousing and put in a new circlip.
