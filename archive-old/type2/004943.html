Subject: [T2] 1980 speedo cable disconnect???

&gt;Is the speedo cable a two piece item? that is,
&gt;does it go from the dashboard (1st piece) then swing through the
&gt;undercarriage (2cd piece) to a wheel with a connection piont in between???

Both cables plug into  the EGR/ O2 mileage counter, which also has a
 3-wire plug which originates from the driver's side headlight harness.

&gt;There was also a vacume line (flexible rubber about 1/4 inch) laying there
&gt;with no obvious connection point to anything above the spare tire area. I
&gt;traced back to the engine compartment where it also was not connected to
&gt;anything. This vehicle once had Dealer A/C installed on it. Could it have
&gt;something to do with that?

Brake booster vacuum hose (goes thru the dash near the steel brake lines ).
Dave
