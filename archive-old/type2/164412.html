Subject: Suspension upgrades

Grupp!  I am currently bringing back to &quot;road&quot;, my '74 Westy, and perhaps have
put a little more &quot;oomph&quot;, in it, but,  I currently have some &quot;wide&quot; audi
wheels and requisite tires, but, should I install the EMPI front and rear sway
bar kit and renew my KYBs front and rear, or should I &quot;back out&quot;, and leave
the &quot;westy&quot; as is....factory suspension, etc.?  I love to go through the
&quot;twistys&quot; in the mountains here, and built the motor up enough to do it, now I
have to make the suspension adapt.  Any sugestions are muchly appreciated!
Sid
