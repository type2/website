Subject: A bunch of questions...

Well, I've been noticing some &quot;irregularities&quot; with the bus lately that I
couldn't track down quickly in Muir so I thought I would post them to the
list and see what everybody thinks.

1)My starter doesn't always work right away. Sometimes when I turn the key I
hear a click(clunk?) but it doesn't turn over. If I try it a couple more
times eventually she'll turn over and start right up. Banging on the
solenoid hasn't made an appreciable difference. I'm assuming I need a new
starter. I took the starter off my parts bus to swap but it seemed to look
really different (the engines are both '73), should the starters be
interchangeable even though they look different ?

2)When I shift down, it seems to take a little more force to push it into
gear and makes a hissing, shushing sound (not grinding) as it does...any
ideas ?

3)We went to a friends cottage for the May long weekend (Victoria day here
in Canada) and the drive involved some fairly largeish hills. After coming
down the last one the bus backfired a couple of times. I hadn't noticed it
doing that before, and I haven't noticed it since. Is this normal after
taking some big hills ?

4(last one))Occasionally, as I'm driving along, the bus seems to &quot;chug&quot;. I
checked the compression last weekend and everything was over 100
(120,110,110,105 if I remember correctly). Is this a timing/unbalanced carbs
issure ?

Thanks all,
Michael
