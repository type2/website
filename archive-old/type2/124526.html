Subject: CHT sender follow-up

Hey Chris, those bi-metal senders are calibrated to 70 degrees F ambient 
temp and are reported to be way off when the ambient temperature is 
different. For example, I've heard that when it is 100 degrees out, the CHT 
reports 30 degrees low (like 270 instead of 300), just when it is hot and 
you need to know if your heads are stressed. Not sure how your are 
calibrating and if the method allows you to check your new sender's accuracy 
at different ambient temps.

John

&gt; I calibrated the sender that I got from an aircraft supply and it reads 
&gt; spot on.
