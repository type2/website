Subject: Re: [T2] Turn signal gone funky!!

&gt; put a new one in and same thing. Both the front and
&gt; rear signals still flash at the bulb, but they also
&gt; flash VERY fast just like the dash indicator arrow.
&gt; Right turn signal flashes correctly as it always
&gt; has....So what's up with that?? Bad flasher relay
&gt; maybe??

A bad relay could be the problem yes. Or may be there
is water leaking from underneath the windshield into
the relay. My '78 bus had the speedy-flashing-problem
mostly with wet-weather.
