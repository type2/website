Subject: Compression in #3

 I have done a much feared compression test on my 68 Westy 1600 and have
found the compression to be 100 psi in every cylinder but #3, which was
coming out at about 50 psi.  I am going to do a valve job next weekend and
re-test the compresssion, and see if there is any improvement.  If in fact
there is no improvement, is it possible for me to do half of an overhaul
and repair #3 and #4 only, or do I have to do the whole engine at one time?
I don't have the money to have someone else do the work, so how much do you
think I will need to spend for all of the parts needed, provided I do all
of the labor?  The Bus seems to be running pretty well, climbing hills in
3rd and only 2nd on steep sections. Will driving with low compression in #3
damage the rest of the engine? Any help is appreciated.  Thanks.
David
