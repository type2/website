&gt;If it can handle turning an AC Pump I bet it can handle an alternator,
&gt;though you'd have to design a mighty funky bracket to do it.

It's on the hot side of the tin again, and the belt it uses is thinner than a standard V-belt like the alternator will probably use.  Other than that, and the aforementioned bracket fabrication, I'm sure it would work.
