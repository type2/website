Subject: Re: [T2] Remote starter location

&gt; I just picked up a simple remote starter. Directions say to plug the black
&gt; wire to a ground (got it) and the red wire to the starter's positive. Since
&gt; the starter has two positive power sources, which one, the main terminal or
&gt; the ignition terminals?

the push on connector should do it.
&gt;
&gt; Just don't want to fry any thing.

if you get the wrong one the starter will turn but the seniod will not
push it in to engage.
