Subject: 75 Campmobile Deluxe For Sale, Arnold MD

I have this bus advertised on the net for $6,000 but
would hook up a list member for less.  My wife, my
mom, my sisters, nobody wants me to sell this bus but
I don't drive it nearly enough anymore, pretty much
just used for camping and cross country trips the last
4 years, and I have a 67 camper I would like to
restore. Busses should be driven so I am going to try
to sell it

of the family.  His name is &quot;Cecil&quot;! W/brake work I
