&gt; question: what sort of adhesive has best proven itself to stick plastic

A light bulb has just come on in my head (gotta sweep up in there).  Hands
up anyone who's had a magazine with a reply card or similar stuck inside it.
That glue they use that's really gloopy and sticky but comes off without
leaving a mess - that would be ideal for this job.  Thing is, does anyone
know where to get it from?  Ideally it would come in a cartridge (like
silicone) and you could just run a bead round the door - voila, perfect
seal!
Wish I'd thought of this last time I put my door panels back on.  Must be
loads of other applications as well (rocker cover gaskets ...?).
