Subject: Oil Temperature ??
Date: Sun, 22 Jul 2001 22:52:03 -0400
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I installed a oil temperature sender and gauge both VDO in my 82 westy also
a head temperature gauge does anybody have knowledge of the proper working
temperatures VW ,states that adjustments to the engine should be done at 73
to 83 deg. Celsius but no top running temp.that  I believe should be 110 deg
Celsius for oil, as far that the head temp.in Fahrenheit as it now about 110
to 125 with engine running but goes as high as 275 Fahrenheit if engine shut
of hot. any opinions ?
Karl
