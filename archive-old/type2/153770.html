Subject: Oil cooler as heat source inside van.

I was reading the archives and came across a post about putting an oil cooler
inside the van to act as a heat source. With a blower behind it, it would be
more efficient than water. My now gone hero, the famous Mike West answered
that it would be a daunting mechanical challenge. Has anyone ever pulled this
off, or tried it? I wonder if it would work in cold weather with 10-30 wt.
without blowing the oil filter off to move the oil up front through 12ft. oil
lines and back again?? You would need a way to shut it off too in the summer
when you don't want the heat?
