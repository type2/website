Subject: Window in! (AKA Tight squeeze!)

While waiting on my heads to get done at the shop, I'm still working on the 
interior of The Terrapin Flyer. I finally got the rear passenger window in. 
Now I can put all my cabinets in. The actual putting the window in the hole 
was easy... used the technique from the library and it zipped right in. The 
bear was getting the rubber on the window... took and hour and two helpers in 
the middle of the living room floor last night. First time for everything, we 
ALL learned a little something last night.... like sweat makes a window 
***real** slippery. Finally got it done, though - hooray! ...
