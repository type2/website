Subject: Re: [T2] auxiliary battery

&gt; From: &quot;Timothy Osburn&quot;
&gt; &gt;  So, I'm going for experience here. What is the best/most suitable
&gt; &gt; battery to use for an auxilary?

This isn't the party line, but unless you are planning to do long-term
camping, it doesn't pay to get a deep cycle.  Deep cycle batteries cost a
lot and don't have long warranties like starting batteries.  Starting
batteries don't have as much capacity and don't like to be completely
discharged, but most camper users don't come anywhere near completely
discharging their batteries.  Also, in a pinch, you can &quot;jump yourself&quot; if
you have a starting battery as an auxilary.  This saved my bacon once when
I had a battery isolator go bad on me.

George
