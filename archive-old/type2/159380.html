Subject: Re: [T2] need engine stand plans

Two inch heavy wall square tubing. Build a 'H' Maybe 36&quot; wide, maybe 
36-44&quot; long.

Weld casters to each corner. Then weld a post - same square tubing - to 
one of the sides were the center &quot;bar&quot; of the H joins the side. Pick 
your height. I built mine b/c the store bought stands were too short for 
my taste.

Weld piece of 3&quot; tubing at the top to act as a swivel.

Drill a hole in the top of this and weld a nut on top of a hole. Now 
screw a bolt into this and this will allow you to spin the engine over 
and lock it on position.

Take a smaller diameter of tubing and slide it into the other piece of 
tube. Ideally the OD of this 2nd piece of tube wiuld be nearly the same 
as the ID of the first piece of tubing. Both need to be about 6&quot; long.

Weld a plate to the smaller dia tubing. Now cut some steel bars the 
right length so you can bolt them to the engine case and have them reach 
the steel plate. 1&quot; wide x 1/2&quot; thick by whatever length you want. BIG 
bolts - okay? No margin for error here. Don't want to drop your $1K 
engine on your toe - right?

Mine is home built but has worked WELL for many engines - VW and 
Corvair. It is taller than the store stands and more stable b/c most of 
the store stands have 3 vs 4 wheels. I have about $60-$70 of 1998 
dollars in mine.
