Subject: Re:Fuel injection question about 76 two liter

I had an idea about improving the 'body filler fix' of the cracked &quot;S&quot; duct 
that I posted about on June 2, 2002. I realized that the duct had to flex a 
little as the engine did its job, and the body filler/rope composite didn't 
flex. But it filled the gap pretty well. So I did some trial flexing of the 
duct and observed the amount of gap that appeared and its location. Then I 
scrounged up some &quot;Cordite&quot; which is a roll of fibrous insulating material 
used to replace the glazing on home windows. It is designed top stay 
flexible over its lifetime. I pushed the material into the gap in the duct, 
at full flex, and then let the duct go back to its normal unflexed 
condition. Then I pressed a layer of Cordite onto the duct for about 2 
inches on each side of the gap, and over the gap. The layer was about a 
quarter inch thick, and it flexed with the duct.

Then I cut a long strip of leather (thin pigskin) and wrapped it all around 
the repair, like a CV joint boot. I held the leather tight against the 
Cordite with plastic ties that are used in electrical wiring....one above 
and one below the repair. The ties got the leather really tight around the 
repair. Going to fit the duct back on the vehicle as soon as it stops 
raining here in Ohio....which may be several days. Wow, what a tight fit on 
that lower end. Maybe I'll warm the duct up before trying next time.
