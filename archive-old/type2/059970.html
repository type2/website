Hi Don and the list,

It turns out that I had something go wrong INTERNALLY in my battery that
caused it to
break the circuit.  My VW guy replaced the pos and neg cables and the
battery, and it
fired right up.  It was strange, because the Bus has been running and
starting fine,
without any indication of a weak or moribund battery.  This is the first
time in a
lifetime of driving that I have had this happen with a battery.

Has anyone else experienced this problem?  If not, add it to the seemingly
endless list of
stuff that can go wrong with a Bus electrical system!

  The battery cells contains wertical plates placed next to each other .
When the battery gets older a plate in a battery cell can come loose and
sort of &quot;shortcut&quot; that cell. The result of this is that the battery
delivers a tension of 10 volts. The capacity of carrying current trough
that cell is now reduced. That´s why you still had power enough for the
stereo an some small lamps. when you tried to start Brunhilda there wasn´t
enough current (that´s the amperes) leading capacity. It´s like putting
three good and one bad battery into  your battery operated flashlight. 

Keep her running :-)
