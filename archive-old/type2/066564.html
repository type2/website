Subject: Crankcase Breathing

All,

I'm building a 1776 with dual 36 Dellorto's. 

The breathing system that i'm going to use must refresh the air/fumes
in the case as fast as possible, yet i want to keep the motor as simple
as possible.

I can come up with several reasons for having proper crankcase 
ventilation:

- -To prevent pressure build up in the case.
- -To slow down the aging process of the oil.
- -To get rid of water in the oil/case.
- -Maybe to help cool the engine.

VW machined a groove into the crankpulley hub to suck air into the case,
it also doubles as a sort of oil seal but not really a seal, all oil that 
tries to escape via the crank pulley hole in the case gets sucked back in 
by the groove in the hub. So one could call this forced crankcase
ventilation.

Inspecting the stock VW breathing system combined with what i read makes 
me think that it doesn't meet my standards. It would probably if i 
connected it to the air filters like VW did, but i want to try to avoid 
that solution, we have no law or regulations against an open system on 
older cars here in Holland. 

To achieve this i thought of the following, i would extend the stock 
roaddraft tube so it slightly extends below the sump, and 'slash-cut' 
the lower end of it. The airstream past the bottom of the tube will 
suck on the tube and will help the groove in the crank pulley to refresh
the air/fumes in the case. Systems like this are common on older cars.
(Or i could use the fillertin with the 'S' bend on the end and slash-cut
that, it would then be in the cooling airstream) 

There are some questions i need answers to. 

- -How much vacuum would the slash cut create? Would someone know of a way 
to calculate that somehow by the airspeed and surface area of the 
opening in the tube?

- -Would it be true that how sharper the angle of the slash cut, the higher
the vacuum effect will be?

- -Should i just modify an old oilfiller tin and strap/tape/bolt it to 
the side of my Polo (H2O VW) and hook it up to a vacuum gauge? ;)

Any input is greatly appreciated.


Brian.


Ps, Another method could be a little outlet welded in the collector of 
an extractor header or connected to the right side manifold heat tube
where it comes-out/goes-into the stock muffler, (if you don't need 
manifold heat) both pretty close to the road draft tube, a one-way valve 
of some kind would be necessary to prevent possible fire in the exhaust 
system from entering the case...
