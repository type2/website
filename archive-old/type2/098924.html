Subject: Nostalgia, was: [T2] Wont start at all now...

John;


&lt;When I'm in my bus and it's humming along I sort of back there, back
&lt;to the
&lt;era when, hey, we all knew the truth .... Comes the revolution, as my
&lt;friends used to say.

&lt;The mountains of Mexico, the coasts of Carolina and California, the
&lt;plains
&lt;of Texas, the blue skies by day glittering black by night .... the bus
&lt;is
&lt;home, my home, to all of them.

A MEN
