Subject: 72 westy running rough

what a day ive had. ive had my head in the engine compartment of my 72 westy
with it running all day in 95+ heat. ran rough when cold, but after alot of
messing around (i thought i had an intake leak somewhere as was going nuts
trying to find it) i found out that my new bosch points (about 200 miles on
them) had moved from where i set them and were almost shit. why the bus ran ok
when it was real warmed up but backfired and stumbled when it idled ill never
know. turns out that although 1,3 and 4 were firing # 2 would only run when
real warm and then only above 2000 rpm. so the moral of the story is. just
because you put in new cap, rotor, wires, points and condenser dont think that
one of these things couldnt mess you up. from now on when i run across a
problem like this im gonna just throw in a spare 009 and if it runs ok then i
need to look at what i swapped. 
i also found time to install gauges for temp, oil pressure, volts and a new
tach. gonna be good knowing whats going on back there. 
life seems so short to learn from these adventures, i wish id have had a vw 20
something years ago. 
see you in jerome,,,,,,
