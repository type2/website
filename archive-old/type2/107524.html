Subject: Re: [T2] BA 6 heater

It is a lttle north and east of Sac. Go east on any main road i.e. Florin or 50 til you get to Sunrise. Go
north on Sunrise. As you enter Rancho Cordova, you will find a Pick n Pull on the right on Sunrise at the
corner of Fitzgerald.
Don't go there.....domestic only. Make a left at that corner instead and go a block. On the corner of the next
right turn is the foreign yard. Pay $2 and walk straight in. The mini trucks and vans are along the right end.
If I remember right, there are 5 VW buses and 3 Vanagons. The oldest was a 69 non-walkthru panel. No gas tank
in it..... the 70 Westy and the 71 bus both had the tanks but they were punctured. The 70 had a decent rear
bumper inside it. The Westy interior was mostly gone, what was left was destroyed.
It is getting next to impossible to find 68-71 tanks to put in split buses. All the yards are now puncturing
the tanks :-(
But the senders were still there..... no hole on top.

&gt; I'll be in SAC on Tuesday, at the airport. Where's this place at?
&gt;&gt; Pick n Pull foreign yard on Recycle Rd in Rancho Cordova. There you will find a 2 tone 78 bus with a
complete heater in it.
