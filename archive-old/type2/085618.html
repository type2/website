Subject: Removing a Westy Interior (and putting it back in)

Hello all,

I am soon to begin a most dangerous undertaking: removing a Westy 
interior. The reason is threefold:  (1) a dire need to remove all traces 
of the POs, (2) to look for, and treat, rust spots, and (3) to lay 
insulation and soundproofing materials. My question is this: is it a 
fairly straightforward process to pull out the side cabinet and rear 
bench/bed (and then reinstall them)? I've never attempted anything like 
this and am hoping this is something (the entire project) I could tackle 
over the course of one week off. If anyone has any pointers or things to 
look out for (aside from the layers of grimy residue left by POs) I 
would love to hear them.

Thanks!

Steve
