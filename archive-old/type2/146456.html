I have a 78 transporter that I bought for parts for my 78 daily
driver.  one of the parts is the factory ceiling AC.

However, as I began the process of removing it from the donor and
installing it in the driver i realized that there are several
&quot;cooling fins&quot; (?) mounted under the van that are connected to this
system.  Not to mention that I dont seem to have the compressor
mounting bracket.

Anyway, is there an aftermarket AC solution out there, perhaps
underdash or under seats kind of thing that may be easier to install?

Thanks,

David.
