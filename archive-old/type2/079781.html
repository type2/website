Subject: what i did today

first time heat in a vw today! i just hooked it up for the fun of it, and
sure it was. what a feeling of completeness. defrost, awe the whole works.
i just felt like doing something for the 1st year to the day i heard about
a certain DC dying on the vine in good ol' willits, cali.  heat in a vw. i
had heard about it. been an ostrich though for 20 years. sorta something to
do before i die. heat.

about the discussion of water coming in the front, i found the root of a
front window leak for 1968 bus pilots. the caps that cover the 17mm hex
nuts become swiss cheese over 30+ years. seems water can trickle in through
each wiper's threads and cause a major puddle anywhere depending upon the
tilt of the bus. i recommend checking that plastic, and maybe go with
electrical tape until something suitable is found for a replacement. if
your with a 68 bus with the original wipers, you know what i mean. minor
thing, but can really add a lot of water to the cab. a question long since
on my mind is whether beetle/ghia wiper bearing caps fit the 68. anybody?
