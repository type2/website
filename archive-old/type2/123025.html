Subject: [T2] Fuel Evaporation line

This question then arises.. what to do with the open T if you have no air
cleaner but a simple filter on top of the carb? Is it OK to have tee into
the canister but then have the canister open to atmosphere?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am guessing you are talking type 1 engine here, but this would do for the
progressive too. You should be able to drill a hole in the filter housing
and install a fitting to accept the vent hose. Where is your crankcase
breather hose going? Tee into that if you need to,  maybe add a one way
valve to prevent any issues from a backfire situation... OTOH why not go
stock? Oil bath air cleaning is pretty damn good IMHO and you wont have to
worry about not being able find replacement filter elements.
