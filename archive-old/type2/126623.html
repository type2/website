&gt; Great shots of your work.  I'm also working on the panels in my BUS.  I
&gt; have gone the same route that you have with the 1/4&quot; board.  Same cost
&gt; at home depot but what I got was not pressboard.  I have some pictures
&gt; of my first attempts at it on my on this page of my site ---

Thanks!

I looked at the 1/8&quot; sheets of wood they had, but that stuff just
appeared too brittle. The pressboard is what the factory used (or
similar) and I can see why. I'm not worried about the interior panels,
but the front doors get slammed closed a lot. The brittle wood seems
to me that it would crack and split in a short time.

There's a tool called a Roto-Zip that would probably do a better job
than my $3 cutter bit. But that costs more than $3. ;)
