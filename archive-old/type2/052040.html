They are made of unobtainium and overbuilt to guarantee bullit proof
function in emergency applications. A common Bosch window lift motor is
over $300 typically. These are very low volume replacement parts. The only
window lift motors I have seen fail have ALL been non Bosch motors on
Volvos and English. But that is only in 10 years of servicing all Euro
marks as my sole income of note.
