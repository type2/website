Welcome once again to THE DEPOT HACK--frugal bus improvements for the
not-too-meticulous. ;)

Hoop said:

&gt;&gt; Take the &quot;restored&quot; pedal back to the bus and bolt the free side of the
&gt;&gt; hinge to the floor. Mark it and drill holes, then bolt straight through the
&gt;&gt; floor. My floor is rusty, too, but there was enough there to bolt to.

Then Poor Richard said:

&gt;As an even cheaper, easier alternative, just bolt the hinge onto the pedal as
&gt;well as the floor. Ive done this in my last 2 busses with no problems...

Yessiree. Or you might could attach it by smearing a lot of JB Weld around
with a stick.

DON'T TOUCH THAT DIAL! Coming up on The Depot Hack--rust repair with used
milk jugs and a staple gun. Now these messages...
