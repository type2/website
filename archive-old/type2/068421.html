Subject: Radio Installation

The best fuse choices on the later breadloaf busses for radio installation
are 10 if you want the radio to go off when the key is off or 11/12 (dual
circuit, no difference which) if you want it to play continuously.  In my
experience the stock radio is always on fuse 12. (My experience , however
is limited to '73-'78 so YMMV) There is a down side either way.  If it is
on 10, then no tunes when parked as there is no &quot;accessory&quot; key position. 
On 11/12, you run the risk of leaving it on and low and running your
battery flat. 

A while back someone suggested using the switch in the steering column
that warns if the key has been left in.  This is supremely easy in the
76-79 models and nigh on to impossible in the 70-75 models.  The buzzer
does not exist prior to 70, thus no switch, so delete this and move on.

76-79:

The wire from your ignition switch to the buzzer module is switched and
hot!  On the '76 it should be red, on the 77-79 it should be grey with a
black line or band.  In either event, at the buzzer module, there are 2
wires, one is grey and goes to terminal 86.  Ignore it.  The other is red
or grey/black and goes to terminal 85.  Disconnect this wire and run it
to the power on your radio.  Done.

70-75:

Alas, in the truly &quot;lucas&quot; fashion of some VW electrics, this is another
of those &quot;switches to ground&quot;, like the horn.  If you want to have a go at
this (and after looking at it, I decided not to bother), then here is what
I *think* needs to happen: 

First grab the power for the radio from fuse 11 or 12.  Then you need to
insulate the case of the radio and the antenna from the body/frame of the
car.  This will be a bear, as the case is designed to be the ground and to
be in contact through the dash and all the mounting brackets.  You will
need to use all nylon screws and cardboard/plastic insulators at all
points where the case does or could come in contact with the car.  Then
you need to find the wire from the key switch to the buzzer module. Again
it will be found at teminal 85, but this time it is not power but ground. 
Attach this wire to the case of your radio with a small sheet metal screw. 
Lastly, you will need to remove the driver's side overhead lamp switch. 
within this switch there will be 4 leads.  You need to place a jumper
between the two solid brown leads so that your radio will play even when
the door is closed. 

By and large *WAY* more trouble than it is worth, not to mention that when
all is said and done, you will have a radio that is as reliable as your
horn, and for exactly the same reason. BLEAH!
