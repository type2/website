==============================&gt;
Push some toothpicks into the holes and apply a little Elmers Glue.

While still wet, screw into the &quot;smaller&quot; hole, with the toothpicks serving 
to &quot;downsize&quot; the holes, and the glue, after it sets up, serving to finish 
the &quot;hold&quot;.

Lots of times (most in fact) I don't even bother to use the glue.

Try without the glue first, and see what you get for results.
