&gt; &gt; i've isolated the highbeam dimmer relay with help from Tommy at VW
&gt; &gt; Restorations USA. in my bus it's part number 321 941 583. however,
&gt; &gt; i'm being told by more than three sources now to use 111 941 583.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; the thing that has me a little confused/worried is that all of the
&gt; &gt; catalogs i've seen on the web list 111 941 583 as a '68-69 part, not
&gt; &gt; a 1971.
&gt; 
&gt; Up to vin # 219 300 000 [end of 69] the relay is 111 941 583
&gt; &gt;From vin # 211 2000 001 [start of 71] the relay is 411 941 583C
&gt; What did 70 use??
&gt; I have an extra 71 fuse box [B] and the right most relay is the high/low
&gt; relay. The middle one is turn signals. I have the relay in my hand and there
&gt; is no VW part number on it. Siemons did not feel like putting one on it? It
&gt; does have 12v max 2 x 150W and it is 5 pin.

If you install the jumper between two pins as I suggested in an earlier
post, the relay two relays are electrically identical.  The 4-pin relay
has the jumper connection built in, so the relay is only switchable when
headlight voltage is present.  The earlier relay could be switched even
with the headlights off, which  is why it needed a second voltage source.
