&gt; &gt;     Careful there! I once broke off a gland nut tightening it too much.
&gt; &gt;Gland nuts are just one of the many very crappy features of those
&gt; &gt;engines --
&gt; 
&gt; Hmm.  Bothersome, but not crappy.  I (200lbs) have personally bounced up
&gt; and down at the end of a 5 foot breaker to tighten that &quot;crappy&quot; nut and
&gt; have never even so much as dinged the nut.  I am personally of the
&gt; inclination that these things are relatively robust,  seeing as this
&gt; design has *somehow* held up in MILLIONS of engines over the space of the
&gt; past 60 or so years, so VW must've done something right.  The original nut
&gt; in my beetle seemed to last somewhere in the neighborhood of 300k-500k
&gt; miles with no apparent problems, maybe it was the exception rather than
&gt; the rule.
&gt; 
&gt; Let's all come to the realization that the beetle motor was the heart of a
&gt; very well designed package.  Not perfect, but good.  The only reason that
&gt; the type 4 engine was ever employed was to meet the insatiable power
&gt; demands of an American buying public.  Let us not forget that VW used the
&gt; 1600 well into the '80s (vanagons) in Europe and continues to use it in
&gt; Brazil and Mexico (in beetles).
&gt; 
&gt; I personally believe that my '71 1600DP doghouse engine is a fine design.
&gt; It has its drawbacks, but it has somehow managed to help rack up 246,000
&gt; miles on my bus since it was installed in '71. (That's when the PO
&gt; replaced the SP after an overheat)
&gt; 
&gt; YMMV, I've been quite happy with t1-1600 engines (except for the run-in
&gt; with a crappy machinist, but that's another story).  I'd recommend them to
&gt; anyone searching for a bus.

Blake:
I should have said: &quot;make sure you use a German  gland nut and err on
the high side!&quot;
The first engine I built (when I was 16) had the gland nut come off (had
no good way to hold the flywheel from turning),33 years later, I've
never made that mistake a second time (wish I could always say that).
I agree, the gland nut is no big deal, just gotta do it right. Sure wish
type 1 motors had aluminum cases, though (or some good aftermarket
company made stock replacements in aluminum.)
