 I would be concerned about the rings being lined up properly, and since I
read Hoover's procedure, I would also be paranoid about a lot of other stuff
as well.  Joel Lambert, Atmore, AL  (had both rebuilds done by others)


there is some blowby, although the amount has remained constant (and more
or less manageable) since I put the engine together about four years ago.
