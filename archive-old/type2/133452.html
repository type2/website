actually I think VW had a correction and stated not to use the serrated
lock washers at all. I have discarded mine years ago and have had no
problems just using the funny two holed washers that connect two bolts
together....

&gt; Remember torque the bolts only to 25 ft lbs. Over-torquing will only
&gt; make you miserable next time.

good point for all bolts and nuts, more people overtorque than undertorque
in my experience.

&gt; Also check the condition of your allen wrench or allen socket. Those
&gt; things start to round out with use (especially the way I use them). A
&gt; rounded allen wrench is a great way to ruin a whole set of bolts.

many CV bolts do not use allen wrenches but rather the triple square
wrench (I think that is what it is called) these are not expensive and can
be found in most FLAPS

&gt; Half shafts are on of my least favorite maintenance items. Awkward
&gt; positions under the bus, the weight of the halfshaft, 12 damn bolts,
&gt; rotating the shaft  get to the bolts. the dirt, the freshly grease CV
&gt; joints that have to stay clean, correctly positioning the shaft to get
&gt; the bolts started..... Arrrgggg.

surgical gloves are worth thier weight in gold on this job.
I always keep a box in the bus now days
(but be carefull many people are alergic to latex, you might want to get
the latex free versions of the gloves)
