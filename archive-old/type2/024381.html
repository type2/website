Subject: Wheel stud differences F &amp; R ('77).
Message-ID: &lt;7v9mr6$kemf_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

Hi,
	Can anyone tell me the differences between the front and
rear wheel mounting studs on a '77 baywindow camper?

 Length? Profile? I see they have different part numbers but the 
illustrations I have seen arn't detailed enough to distinguish
between them.

Cheers,
	W.
