Subject: Beauty ring or trim ring source found

I saw a friend's VW bus with stock hubcaps and a set of unknown brand 
beauty rings. Thought his looked quite sharp.

Now looks like I may have found a good source for what some folks call 
beauty rings or trim rings...

http://www.wheelvintiques_dot_com/

About $23-$25 each.

Page 36 of the PDF format catalog that you can download.

They have 3 styles of trim rings for 14&quot; wheels 5&quot; or wider.

If anyone pursues this let me know how they fit. my budget is still thin 
and being applied to Transvair hurdles right now.
