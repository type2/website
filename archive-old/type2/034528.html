&gt; I have no problem using Vise-grips either except..... it depends on the
&gt; brand of them. Cheap Taiwan crap will get you in trouble:)  Good ones like
&gt; Vise-Grip brand or Craftsman work very well. Some 'cheap' tools you can get
&gt; will work just fine, i.e. hammers. Others break, bend, slip, crack, etc.

also a GOOD quality pipe wrench will work.....(dad's a plumber, the're
