Hi all:

Since I've got the engine out anyway, and since I noticed a torn CV joint 
boot, and since a couple of months ago I bought 4 CV joints from Bus 
Depot, I decided to pull the drive shafts and replace them all.

I noticed that the &quot;inboard&quot; CV joints seem to have received &quot;extra&quot; 
lubrication from the transmission, which suggests some sort of leak at 
the final drive flanges.  I seem to recall somebody discussing how to 
replace some sort of seals at the final drive flanges, but I'm coming up 
blank in the archives.  Can anyone point me in the right direction on this?

TIA.
