OK, well I never really left, the list anyway. As those who know me know, I 
sold my '76 Westy back in April, right after Everybus 2000. I then bought a 
used Ch*vy conversion van, and tried for months to convince myself that I was 
done with VW buses. Well, it didn't work. Just tonight, I bought another '76 
Westy. It's kinda rough, and will need quite a bit of work, but I learned a 
lot from my last restoration, and will be going into this one better prepared 
and a bit wiser. My goal: have it ready by Everybus 2001. Are you listening 
Jamie Rivers and crew? Overnight at my place again, just get here earlier 
this time and we'll toss some burgers on the grill! Gotta run, gotta get a 
check out to LiMBO, as I'd let my membership go. Take care all, Jeff S.
