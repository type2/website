Subject: Leaded or Unleaded Gas

In the November issue of Volksworld, in response to a reader's query, Gene Berg
is quoted as saying &quot;because of the US and Brazilian markets all VW cylinder 
heads made since the early 70s may be used with unleaded fuel&quot; (my parapharse).

I've always thought/been told that the standard valve sets were not hard 
enough to run with unleaded petrol.

What's the wisdom of the list on this?

If unleaded petrol is 'safe' for VWs I could save my self the equivalent of
2 cents per mile as well as doing a little more for the environment.

BTW
I've been following the thread on emmissions standards with some interest.

You may like to know that in the UK all new cars have catalytic converters and 
pass a smog test each year after 3 years; older cars have a less stringent 
annual smog test; but even older cars (including my '73 T2) have only to 'not 
have a smokey exhaust when idling with the engine warm'.
The test is done as part of the annual road worthiness test known as the MOT 
(Ministry of Transport) test.
