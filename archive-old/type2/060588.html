Subject: Subaru engines in a Bus...

I don't know where to get the info, but someone is making a conversion kit for Type II's
to the Subaru 1800cc engine.  I have seen a couple of them on the road.  Since both are
&quot;boxer&quot; opposed 4's, I would think that the fit in the engine compartment would be easy
enough.  The cooling is achieved by running lines to the front of the vehicle, and the
radiator and radiator guard mount on the front bumper!

I guess if you wanted a more elegant installation, you could order the front panel they
use on the Mexibusses, which are also running water-cooled engines (Rabbit, I think...),
and have the radiator nicely faired into the sheet metal.
