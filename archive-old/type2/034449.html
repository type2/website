&gt;I'm replacing the sliding door rubber on my '71 and have a question as
&gt;how the rubber  should be oriented. One of the vertical sections of the
&gt;rubber has a channel or groove that is visible when looking at the
&gt;sliding door opening from outside. Should this groove be to the front or
&gt;rear of the bus? My sliding door is on the right side. Thanks and happy
&gt;new year!!


If you have a factory seal, there is a lip molded in that orients to the
front latch. If you have an aftermarket seal, follow their instructions.
With a factory seal, no adhesive is normally needed, although just a dab at
the corners ist ok. You can use a small scribe or screwdriver to run
carefully along the grove to tuck it into place. 

Be sure to clean the metal work descently before installing the seal. The
less dirt/grit/crud the better. Do neutralize rust and seal any paint chips
or worse with a good enamel to seal the metal from the air as standard
procedure.
