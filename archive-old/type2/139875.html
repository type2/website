&gt; &gt; one little irony, the core charge and what it will cost me to return the
&gt;  core is about the same,.....but that is the shippers fault not Bus Depot
&gt;
&gt; That would be the perfect opportunity to take the core over to your
&gt; local starter rebuilder and have it rebuilt as a spare.

which is what I will probably do, either that or try to rebuild it
myself...
