Hey Y'all,
  I have a 73 bus Automatic trans for sale. I really need to sell this
and will sell it complete with all shift linkage for $100. It works
great and is complete. It is still mounted in the bus and I will pull
it for you. I need the money for another project. Anyone with a 73 auto
combo will know that this is a very rare combo in a 73, to add to that
the shift handle is a one year only, but will mount into any bus. It is
a pull up type handle not a push button. The trans is the same for many
years, only the handle is different.
