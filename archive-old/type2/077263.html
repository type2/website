Subject: [T2] Windshield Washer and getting my pants wet...

Hi guys,


Well I sorted the battery issue... but my Bus never ceases to 
amaze be. I decided to fill the container with fresh cleaning fluid  
(actually it's the first time I did that) - ok, fine 'till then. After that I 
went for a drive and pulled on a service station to pressurize the 
container. I read somewhere that it should be pressurized to a 
maximum of 42 PSI - so I choose to fill it at 35 PSI. A friend 
reached for the air pump hose and I plugged it in. For some 
seconds nothing seemed to happen, then I heard a &quot;swiissh&quot; like 
sound and I saw that I was loosing air through the bus hose, a little 
while after I felt my pants wet - I looked and saw that cleaning fluid 
was pouring from under the steering wheel.  I screw the cap and  
tested the washer and it had very little pressure on.
What exactly went wrong? Thanks in advance!

(sorry for possible incorrect English)
