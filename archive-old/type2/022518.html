Thanks Brian-
                     When I got the wheels, I put both a bus rim and the MB 
rim on small blocks
on a level surface. The blocks were in the same position relative to the rims 
as a brake
drum but horizontal- Picture that? A straightedge could be laid across the 
outer edge of
both rims. Close enough?
