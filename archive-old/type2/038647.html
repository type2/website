Subject: Re: Fuel Leak

[...]



&gt; I have a 77 Camper with EFI. The other day when I filled up the tank, fuel
leaked out the driver side rear quarter panel (the opposite side from the
filler). Inside the engine compartment I could not locate the leak. All of
the fuel lines were perfectly dry, but the area where the 2nd battery should
be had a fair amount of gasoline.
&gt;
&gt; Any idea what I should check?
&gt; Can I get to the tank without removing the engine?

It is not the tank.
It is the connecting hose for the vent lines.
Look in the outside corner of the air vent. See the tubing?
That is part of the tank vent system. It goes down along the top of the
engine compartment above the left battery tray. Feel for it, it is there.
There is a 1&quot; connecting rubber line up there. Replace it, it is split.
