Subject: RE:points vs electronic ignition

X-Orig: &lt;crick_at_americasm01.nt_dot_com&gt;

Someone mentioned an advantage of 
electronic ignition was not needing to adjust points every few weeks
to avoid the performance degradations?
All my experience with cars has been that points only need attention
every few years? Although the rubbing block slowly wears down, and
the gap very gradually gets smaller, this is a very slow process if you
lubricate the cam? Similarly if your condenser is good, the rate at which
the contacts degrade is pretty slow as well.
Although I've checked points many times in my life, its not very often
I've ever needed to adjust them, or replace them. There have been
times I've replaced points because I'd bought new ones, and thought
I might as well replace them, but really didn't need to. BTW this habit has
been the source of the few ignition problems I've ever encountered 
in my life
 - once improperly tightened new points fell closed - blew the muffler off
- once a bad new condenser stranded me a long way from town
- once bad new spark plugs would have stranded me but I put the 
  old ones back in.

So now I don't mess with it unless necessary. I check the points on my van
a few times a year, but its been a few years since I needed to adjust them?
Timing hasn't moved since I put that distributor in the van. It was already
set right;-)

Can you tell I'm from the &quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it!&quot; school of
mechanics?
