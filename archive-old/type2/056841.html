Subject: Needed: engine in N Ca/OR

Hi folks;

I have a '75 bay window (PO converted it from automatic to manual) which 
is in dire need of a new or newer engine, sliding door lock, and a set of 
tires. I also bought a set of louvered windows which I will swap out; I 
will have the set of standard side windows available soon.

I would appreciate any good suggestions as what best to use for 
replacement. (I'm not fanatic about keeping 'Pegasus' authentic '1975'; 
again, reliability and convenience are my top priorities.) My gut tells 
me to stay with stock, which is the 1800, but if there were a better 
solution for approx. the same expense, (2000?) this would of course be 
the best time to do it. I definitely would be looking for highest 
reliability and longevity, not top speed. (Shouldn't try to make a race 
horse out of a Clydesdale; they're too good at hauling beer wagons 
anyway!)

My most plentiful commodity is time, not money, so I can pull, swap, haul 
whatever would be needed. I would prefer dealing with a private party but 
would also be interested in boneyards or shops that would just happen to 
have a good fit. The right deal is more important to me than travel 
distance.

I'm willing and able to travel as far N as OR/WA border, or S as far as 
Santa Barbara/Ventura to pickup from anybody having a healthy replacement 
for sale, to donate, trade, or barter for a week's worth of work. 

As far as timing is concerned I'm heading for Baja in mid Sept so I have 
plenty of time and can schedule it anyway I want to.

I'm a total novice in this engine swap dept and will appreciate all 
sensible advice. 

Thanks for your all your help.
