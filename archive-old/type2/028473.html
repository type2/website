Clear a path to the rear, brake lever off, clutch depressed, Bus in reverse,
rev up the motor to 2500 RPM, dump the clutch.  Brutal but usually
effective.  Sometimes takes more than one try. If it's reeeeeeely stuck and
this doesn't work, try spraying the shoes with BrakeKleen or the like.
Getting the shoes wet can sometimes loosen the grip of improper storage.
Repeat brutal force method.  I know, I'm an animal...

Subject: [T2] stuck rear brakes

my bus has been stationary for quite a while, with the e-brake on. i
went to move it the other day, and i think the rear brakes are
sticking. is there an easy way to unstick them without disassembing
the whole thing? I'm pretty sure i need to do some brake work anyway
[which i'm having a shop handle], but i'd prefer driving it there to
calling AAA and having to explain why i want a flatbed!

maybe there's something i can pry out with a screwdriver or some
miracle lubricant?
