All,
  The following is the latest info I have received from my friend,
Victor, in Mexico City....
Hi Daniel How are you and your family?

Hey my buddy, I just hang up the telephone with my friend, the one who
has the VW agency. Here it is what he said to me:

He can´t export the automobile because a deal he has with the VW
Headquerters, but he had sold several units to his friends with a
mexican adress and They took the unit to the USA with no problem.

He doesn´t know if you can buy the license, because the car needs to
cover some requirements, just like the enviromental things, security
matters (bumpers etc.), the engine etc.

The bus you need it is not made in Mexico, it is made in Brazil, so then
Mexico imports the buses. 
If you want we can make an arrengement, just like this:

I can buy the unit here in Mexico and you or someone you decide come
here for it. I give you a letter telling that I am borrowing the bus to
you in the USA for a while. This is how my friend has been working with
that, it is legal and no probelma. 

You can search the requirements that the car needs to have, for the
license. My friend didn´t know who made that.

I really hope that i can help you, just tell me what else I can do for
you, and I also hope that you can understand my english.

Say hello to you wife and children.

So there you all have it. This is what I have found out so far,,,will
keep you
posted.
   Also,,I am not advocating any of this, I am just passing along what I
find.
I dont realy want to borow a bus I would want to own it. However, if you
live
close to the border this arrangement might work.
