      Hi.


I pulled the BN4 gas heater out of the 73 Westy yesterday and cleaned it up,
checked the glow/spark plug and anything else i could see.
Ive read VanNess's articles but still have a question, or two.
I reinstalled it tonight and was wondering......
   The fuel &quot;in&quot; line to the pump comes from the left hand lower firewall.
Is this correct?
Also i had previously bench checked the pump for operation but now when i
turn the timer on the fan runs for a couple minuits but no pump ticking?
   Should the pump be primed?
Any other suggestions?

Thanks All.

P.S.  Bought some funky southwest material today for the wife to sew into
new curtains!
