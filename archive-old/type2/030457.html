Err... because it's easier that way? :-)  I have not done an automatic,
but I have done *lots* of manuals and, IMHO, removing and installing the
unit on a breadloaf body [1] is easier than installing them separately.
Lining up the input shaft and clutch disc on the motor by pulling and
tilting while it is up on a jack, sliding around and trying to tilt off
into oblivion has always been one of the more exciting events in my VW
career, and I will gladly remove the extra 18 nuts and bolts required to
remove the manual trans to be able to do that line-up on the ground. On
the weight, once a load passes a certain poundage (and the T4 engine is
*way* past it all by itself), I am going hydraulic, and that jack is rated
for 2000 pounds.. it handles 750 pounds with the same aplomb as 500.  It
don't care.

Other opinions on this vary.  I know lots of people who would agree with
you rather than me.  There is a definite time saving to not removing the
all the bolts and nuts, and you really should be replacing those serrated
washers on the CV's each time you take out the bolt, not to mention the
danger of stripping one of them.  It may be one of those 'religious&quot;
thangs, no one's right, we just don't agree :-)

&quot;Can I drive on two cylinders?&quot; poster.

[1] On a side note disproving my position, of course.... I am looking
at replacing the clutch on the Vanagon (I gotta change my driving style :)
and Sean is anxious to have a go at pulling the trans *without* pulling
the engine, which is theoretically possible on the V'gon body.  Years
back, during a spate of &quot;can I do a valve job without pulling the engine?&quot;
posts (yes, in theory; but in practice, it is *easier* to pull the damn
thing!), I opined to Ken that I was awaiting the &quot;Can I replace my clutch
without pulling the engine?&quot; post....  Now it looks like I will be the one
to do it! :-) [2]

[2] man, I *love* footnotes (even more than parentheses :-)
