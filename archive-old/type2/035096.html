Subject: steering box

Recently purchased a '70 Westy that steered hard. When I checked the steering
box found it covered in 1/4&quot; of grease.  Removed, disassembled and cleaned it
and found no appreciable wear. Someone had filled it with heavier grease when
the seals had gone bad.  Have new seals on order from local bearing distributor.
Original seals BTW have size molded on them. When seals arrive am going to
rebuild per Bentley. Apparently this is only possible on '68 through '72 models
with worm and peg steering box. Local machine shop has wrench to measure in. lb.
Let everyone know how it turns out.
