Subject: F: Rodney's driving lessons

&gt;My father also told me that one of the first cars I ever rode in was a
&gt;brand-spanking-new 1968 RHD baywindow bus when my folks moved to
&gt;Nigeria when I was 8 weeks old.  (Yes, that means I'm 28 this year.)
&gt;So I guess I've had buses in my blood longer than I thought!  I always
&gt;thought I liked them because of the 79 my dad owned and on which I
&gt;learned to drive.

Buses in your blood and probably a little vice versa.  I just hope you
didn't do too much damage to vans 1-78 while you were learning.
;)
