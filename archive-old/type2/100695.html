Subject: Re: Home made Poptop canvas

For warm-weather campers, consider replacing the canvas with window screen material.  I used the black plastic kind on mine.  Cost was minimal and 
it only took an hour or so to install.  I just cut a big length wide enough to reach from roof to poptop in extended position and stapled it all the way 
around to the front (71 poptop) where I overlapped the edges by about a foot &amp; didn't even bother to seal the edges.  Then I did the tedious screw-
down-the-metal-strips part on the bottom and trimmed off the excess.

When it rains I just oull down the top or for longer periods I'll stretch a tarp over the whole rig, though eventually I might put a second inner &quot;tube&quot; of 
canvas that could be rolled up/down inside the screen to seal out rain and cold.  I have seen this done with a square splitty poptop.  At that point it 
might be more cost-effective to just buy and install a repro canvas kit, though.

It's definitely not as all-weather as the original style but it's awesome for mild weather and perfect for summer.  It's almost invisible against the stars, 
and on a cool night when I'm snug under the blankie it's almost like sleeping out of doors.
