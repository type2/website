Subject: megasquirt and bus FI

hello

im a bit new to megasquirt, i did a bit of search on type 2 archive, but i
cant find some information.  Ill try to resume what ive found and maybe a FI
guru could complete for the benefit of all !

I can replace my ECU from my bus with a unit called Megasquirt ;

But megasquirt does not use Air Flow Meter as our ECU does.  Instead, we
have 2 choice:  use Throttle position and /or Air Pressure Sensor (MAP?)

Then we can modify data in the megasquirt or take some already programmed by
another bus megasquirt!

We can Also use an oxygen sensor in our manifold to help megasquirt get the
right mixture.

This was easily found on Type 2 Archive, but the blackhole here, is How can
we change our Air Flow Meter by a Air Pressure, AND where or on what kind of
scrapyard car can we find such a thing!!!

Once we found a Air Pressure Sensor, well have to fit it on our intake
plenum.... im i right ?  N change at all except the air intake where we get
rid of the AFM then replaced by the MAP ?

Then at the end we have to modify our wire harness so it will connect to the
megasquirt

Anyone can add comment/technical website/ tips ?    ECU are getting much
rare everyday, at the end if we ant to continue to use FI it will be
Megasquirt or a complete overhaul with CIS !!

tx

mike
