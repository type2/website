Subject: Re: [VB] Jerome Jamboree (Burning Man)

Just a correction, there *were* about 35,000 people at Bman last year,
and there were a lot of VW busses in attendance, but no means half.  I'd 
be surprised if busses made up more than 1% of all vehicles. I hope that 
comment was meant in a figurative way.  :)

I drove my '76 Westy down there from Seattle last year with no more
problem than a flaky blinker.  I've slept in busses two of the years
I've gone, and they're the best vehicle you could possibly stay in.  Put
that pop-top up, open the back to let the wind blow through, and you can
sleep in 'til 11a.m., as opposed to all your friends in tents who will
be cooked awake by 9.

That said, here are my recommendations if you're wanting to take your
precious bus to Burning Man...

- If your bus is your baby, it's spotless, and you're out waxing it
every weekend, trust me and just don't take it.  Playa dust will forever
be a part of you, and a part of your bus.  You'll end up loving it, but
your bus will never be spotless ever again.

- Bring plenty of tools, spare parts and oil, maybe a spare battery as
well.  Even if your bus don't need them, it's likely someone else's will.

- Get AAA, or one of the green alternatives.  It's a long tow to Reno.

- Change your air filter before you leave, and have a fresh one waiting
when you get home.

- Don't bother with window screens.  There are few insects to speak of,
and they won't do any good against the dust.  Curtains are a must though.

- A canopy or tent that attaches to the side of your bus is a great
idea, but make damn sure you can stake it into the ground and attach it
to your bus so that it won't blow away.  Huge dust devils rip through
people's camps all the time.  And be prepared to take it down if a
serious wind storm comes up.  A huge geodesic dome I was camped by caved 
in during a storm in 2000.  The wind gets serious around there.

- Water weighs eight pounds per gallon.  If you have two people for
seven days, 2gal x 2people x 7 days x 8lbs = 225 lbs. of water.  Not too
bad, but take it into account, and center the weight over your axle.

- Bring something to put under your bus (again, that won't blow away) if
it leaks oil.  Oil spots on the playa are difficult to clean up.  If you
leave them there, someone else will have to clean them up for you.

- Be prepared to detail your bus after you get it home.  I'm talking
inside, outside, engine compartment, everywhere.  Playa dust is heavily
alkali, and causes rust like battery acid.  Playa dust mixed with the
oil on your engine is a serious pain.

- Give yourself extra time to get there, and extra time to get home.
You just can't be in a rush when you're driving a bus.

&gt;     Just got back into town from a short trip so I'm a little tardy in
&gt; responding to the feedback on BM.
&gt; 
&gt;      However,  I was recently talking to some folks who attend BM regularly,
&gt; &amp; mentioned I was planning on hanging w/a  VW bus group.  They responded
&gt; that last year there were about 35,000 folks at BM  &amp; that about half of
&gt; them were in VW buses! That would make BM the largest bus show in the
&gt; world????
