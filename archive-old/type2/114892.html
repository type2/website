Subject: Re: [T2] Front side marker housing &amp; seals

&gt;In my quest to have a nice bus I have new front side &gt;marker lenses but I can't seem to find the &gt;housing/backing plate or whatever you want to call 
&gt;it, anywhere.

Brandt,

It's just a reflector, there are no electrical parts. Put the seal and the reflector on the bus and screw down.

&gt;Also, anyone know where to get a new rear hatch &gt;handle seal? The one that is about the size of a &gt;half dollar that goes between the door and the thumb 
&gt;handle. (not to be confused with the engine door)

I think I got one from the Busdepot. Check the other usual suspects based on geography.

Billy
