Subject: Westies in the Woods pictures

Just random snapshots from this weekend in Stokes Forest.  

I'm still uploading pics as of 20:52EST, but the framework is already there:

Despite the rain, we still had a good time and had a pretty good turnout.  At 
least we didn't have to worry about ticks.  :-)  

For putluck supper, the traditional turkeys (courtesy of Ron and Becky) were 
cooked in the fire (that's what the big things in aluminum foil) and everyone 
else brough the rest of the grub.

Thanks to Ron and Becky for putting on the event.
