Subject: Re: Van Heater System Re-design

&gt;Why not design an auxillary water heating system that heats water 
&gt;(connect up around the exhaust), Run through tubes up front into a heater 
&gt;core, and connect a fan to blow air through the heater core? Just a  
&gt;thought - water i s so much more efficient at transfer heat than air. You 
&gt;can add a bottle of Redline WaterWetter to the the water to improve the 
&gt;thermal efficiency of the water and also to help guard against corrosion.

The problem with doing this is that it would lower the temperature of the
heat exchangers to the point where the water vapor in the exhaust would
condense.  Still not a problem except that all fuel, no mater how well
refined, contains sulfur.  When the vapor condenses, you will end up with
small amounts of sulfuric acid which will quickly destroy your exhaust
system.  To succesfully do this, the exhaust system must be fabricated out
of stainless steel--not cheap.
