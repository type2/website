Subject: Re: [T2] &quot;Remanufactured by Bosch&quot; Alternator

I must have missed that post because I don't remember seeing it here, but 
in any case it is not true to my knowledge.  The last &quot;rebuilt by Bosch&quot; 
alternator I bought came with a one-year warranty.

&gt;My alternator is bad on my 74 Westy.  After pulling it, it has a
&gt;&quot;Remanufactured by Bosch&quot; sticker on the side.  I read here that any
&gt;alternator rebuilt by Bosch has a lifetime warranty.  I was wondering if
&gt;that is indeed true, and if it is, where and how do I get it replaced?
