&lt;&lt; In honor of the new stereo that I just put in my bus....I was hoping
to make the nearest approximation of &quot;the ultimate vw bus mix cd&quot;.
Being a child of the 90s, I'm I probably missed out on a lot of bus
related anthems. Can anyone recommend some songs that should be on the
mix?

Thanks,
Scott &gt;&gt;

This song is called Alice's Restaurant, and it's about Alice, and the 
restaurant, but Alice's Restaurant is not the name of the restaur-
ant, that's just the name of the song, and that's why I called the
song Alice's Restaurant... :-)
