 On my 74 1800, a hose from the charcoal canister on the firewall connects to
the fan housing.  I think it is there to provide a positive pressure and flow
through the canister.

The hose from the brake booster should be attached to a manifold source.  Each
manifold has a large port.  On mine, there is a connecting pipe with a port at
the left front where a hole is in the front tin.
