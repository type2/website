Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Insulation

&lt;I rolled the window up and the boom boom literally hurt my ears.  And he was all the way in the back of me!  I looked at the guy to my right, thinking it had to be his car, and he put his fingers in his ears.&gt;


Hmmm, still thinking some sort of radar based ray-gun (old microwave parts) where a quick invisible shot would render their stereo inoperative. Fry all the circuits or something... Of course they'd prob see me, the &quot;ray-gun&quot; would also render the engine inop (fry the engine computer) and they would come beat my a**... 

Hmmm, back to the old drawing board. &lt;grin!&gt; 

This issue is rising to level of pet peeve! I'm getting old and grumpy. &lt;grin!&gt; 

Chris
