Subject: Re: [T2] Re: The Hubcap

Not that it's really my business... oh wait, I keep seeing these posts in my
mailbox... but it sounds like a prime time to start another sojourn for
another relic. It may not have the history, but if done right it would lack
the apparent hubris associated with as well as sedentary nature of the
current HubCap.  That is to say, there is no reason There Can Be Only One.

&gt; will take care of it without involving any of you.  Stay
&gt; &gt; tuned to the VW community and you will find out where and when the
&gt; &gt; Infamous Hubcap re-surfaces!
&gt;
&gt; Sounds kinda scary to me.
&gt;
&gt; Am I the only one who found this to be more than a little disconcerting?
&gt;
&gt;
Worse'n that...Homeland Security has taken an interest in the Hubcap
whereabouts... ;-(
