Subject: [T2] CV joint question

Last fall, I installed new CV joints with new Rockford boots on my 79 at
the same time as I installed a rebuilt (manual) transmission.  After I
drove it a bit I crawled underneath and saw that CV joint grease had
somehow worked its way out of the joints and sprayed all over the place due
to the the effects of centifugal force.  This happened with both the inner
and outer CV joints.  A hell of a mess under there.

Has anyone else seen this happen?  Is this normal?  Someone suggested that
I had overpacked the joints.
