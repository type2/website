Subject: [T2] stereo noise

&gt;and I can tell you this:  I can kill any of those charging systems &gt;in less
than 12 months with 100watts of rated power. Just install &gt;two Orion
225HCCA's and run them mixed mono, pull the mono channel &gt;down to 1 ohm on
say 4 DVC 10&quot; subs

This is where you just go off the wagon. Four 10&quot; woofers in the bus?
Is that car stereo enjoyment? I think its:

1. overkill to the point of stupidity
2. noise pollution

___________________________________________________

This is not MY system... and never would be.  But it is an example of what
people build, and a bus would be pretty well suited for a system this size
if it were what someone liked.  I was showing an example of what power some
like in the vehicles, and it would kill the charging system.
___________________________________________________
And you can argue that you have the right to put anything in your car and
make it as loud as you want, but George and my point is a much more
important one, that being how big of a selfish ass do you want to be about
bothering the hell out people trying to put their kids to sleep at night?
And what is the point where car audio becomes irrational?

___________________________________________________

Opinion again.  Having a high end stereo does not mean that it transforms
someone into an inconsiderate ass.  You just don't know that because you
only hear the ones that annoy you.  See there are more of them out there
George and Billy, those people just have the sense to turn it down when
passing neighborhoods, and at night.  I'll admit there are fewer people like
this, than there are teenagers with an endless supply of bass-heavy rap CD's
and a need to remind the rest of the world. That doesn't make the stereo
annoying, just the owner.

Have either of you ever been to a great sounding IMAX theater?  Ask them how
many subwoofers they have... go ahead.  Then, next time you are at a show
and you see one of these really bad systems, take your absolute favorite
music piece and beg that person to drive you around the block and listen a
moderate level.  Lots of power and lots of speakers doesn't always equal
loud.  In the car audio world power equals driver control.  That can lead to
volume but it doesn't have to.  Now who is ripping into someone needlessly?

___________________________________________________
Let me word this easier for you. So people who've &quot;installed stereos&quot; aren't
as qualified as someone like you who has been a &quot;stereo salesman/installer&quot;.
Oh I see. Did you receive a EE degree to obtain that coveted position?
___________________________________________________
Electrical Engineers don't know everything about every electricity related
field either.  Knowing theory and being able to apply it can be separated by
a lot of product knowledge.  No, wasn't certified.  Better than that, I was
responsible for the reputation and the liability of the store.  See screwing
up and recommending the wrong product to a customer can result in liability
whether warranty, or damage the vehicle.  This type of liability can lead to
no job for the salesman/installer.  You learn to become qualified about such
things very quickly, or you find another line of work.  That DOES make such
a position on the average more qualified than someone who has put a few CD
players in their friends vehicles.

Being a smart-ass seems to be the primary focus of this thread for a few
people.  How about this?

A bigger alternator may not be necessary.  For larger systems it may.
Consult someone in your area (perhaps a professional car audio shop) for
more details on what is right for your bus.

As for the stereos size, it doesn't matter what you like or don't like.  It
doesn't matter that you actually assume that when you purchase a big stereo
they remove the volume down button or the knob to transform you into a 17
year old punk with now sense.  The opinion of what is right was never called
for in the original post, so it doesn't matter what any of us think about it
now.  What matters is that the original poster gets the charging system they
need.

Simple.
