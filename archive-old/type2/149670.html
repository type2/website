Subject: Re: [T2] Leaking aux air regulator?

Well I found the real problem. After refilling my engine with fresh oil and
filter I started it to check for leaks. None found. :~) I noticed the hose
to the aux air valve wasn't all the way on the Y fitting in the snorkle.
Pushed it on farther and suddenly the engine slowed down to the point it
almost died! :~o Pulled the hose off the Y fitting and the engine ran no
worse? Put my finger over the open Y fitting and the engine speed up and
smoothed right out. Looked down at the other end of the hose and saw the
rubber elbow on the aux air valve is torn almost off. Oh well, simple fix if
I can get a new one.

Hope I haven't wasted too much of your time with my previous hasty post, but
some times putting it in writing helps my brain figure things out.
Thanks for being there,
Tom
