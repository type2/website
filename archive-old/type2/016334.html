Subject: auxiliary blowers and the noise they make...

Dear List-people...
	I installed one of the inline blowers in a Westy, a long time ago... I
have since sold it to a friend. 
	The blower that I installed was (i think) one of those bilge-blowers
that people are talking about, installed towards the front of the long
heater tube between the frame members.
	My only problem with it was the irritating noise that it made when
operational. I'd prefer to have one that ran closer to &quot;whisper quiet&quot;.
I've already considered mounting the blower closer to the rear of the
tube to help alleviate the noise...
	ideas and suggestions welcome.
