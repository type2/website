Subject: [T2] cold weather and the weber carb eck!

Hello
I've read the archive till i turned blue the past 2
days on this carb. It is a Weber 32/36 DFEV and it seems
others have had similar problems with this carb in cold
weather.
The PO lived in California and I sure thats why
he had no problems with icing and keep it. Any way
its got cold here low 40's(colder weather to come :&gt;) and
my bus just doesn't want to run good. I was going to try
and rig something up to draw heat from the heat exchangers
but there is to many holes in them right now to get any
heat from them. I have new ones that i'll be installing some time
soon thanks nikki! In the archive someone suggest using the charcoal 
canister outlet in the tin as a source of hot air, but no air comes out till 
the flaps open up and even then its not very hot at
all. I have my choke setup right I believe, it starts up
fine but when I go to accelerate from a stop it stumbles
and almost stalls. I don't like driving it like this because
I'am afraid i'll be rear ended by some dumb_at_#$
Usually if I'am in the neighborhood I just coast to the side
of the road and acting like I'am parking :) no big deal
The choke is set so its just a slight crack open when cold.
Any ways I figured maybe the choke was opening to early
so I disconnected the positive lead to the choke and
drove around. It drove great like how it did when it was
warm outside. The only down fall seems it might be running to
rich? Some one correct me if I'am wrong but you cant change the
time it takes for the choke to disengage. If you have it set
for warm weather starting or cold it always takes X amount of
minutes till it disengages right?

So here is my question
Could I just leave the power lead to the choke disconnected?
When I did this test it smelled like it was running richer.
Could doing this mess up my engine as muir says, wash the oil
off the cylinder walls or would I only be wasting gas?

BTW, timing is good same with dwell
I also increased the idle a bit to help with stalling.

I know everyone says to drive to help heat the engine up faster
but it doesn't feel safe IMO. Driving around with a engine that
could stall especially at at major inter-section isn't my idea
of fun if you get my drift.  So if anyone with a weber setup
like mine and has any winter driving tips I'd be grateful to
hear them.

thanks in advance for all the help,
