Subject: RE: [T2] Bus Memorabilia

Picked up the latest issue of VW Trends at the bookstore the other
day and it showed a bay window hot wheels car.  I was so happy until
I read the caption.  It's one of the most collectible hot wheels
cars ever and was last auctioned at a price that was tens of
thousands of dollars.  Eeep!   At prices like those I could probably
pay Mike Jackson of this list to create a mold and then cast me one
out of solid gold.  Would be nice to locate a hot wheels or matchbox
bay window someday though that is actually affordable.
