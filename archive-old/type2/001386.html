&gt; OK, I will use the Rocky Mountain Motor Works numbers etc. (Bus Depot uses
&gt; same numbers)


Usually but not always.  Both I and Motorworks use the original VW part
numbers for about 80% of our inventory.  These numbers are typically in a
format of 3 groups of three digits each, perhaps followed by one or two
letters, i.e. 211 829 193C.  In those cases, I will generally use the same
number as Motorworks since we are both using VW numbers (although there may
be slight variations, i.e. I think they put a space before the letter suffix
and I don't).

On aftermarket products that may not have had an original VW part number
(such as an aftermarket electric fuel pump for a bus that came from the
factory with a mechanical one), the numbers that Motorworks uses are made up
by them.  You can usually tell these because they're not in that &quot;123 456
789&quot; format.  In those cases, I try to list the Motorworks part number on my
website for your convenience so you can crossreference it, but not in all
cases.  In other cases, I may use a part number that is used by a different
supplier - or even list the same part twice, once under the Motorworks
number and once under a number used by another supplier.  In the latter
case, you would be savy to order the one that's cheaper, since sometimes my
alternate vendor is cheaper than Motorworks on the same parrt.  So if the
part number you need does not appear to be an actual VW number (as described
above) it may pay to browse the listings under &quot;fuel system&quot; or whatever and
see what's there first, rather than just searching by the Motorworks number.
You may find a better deal that way.  If not, you can always try a part
number search using the Motorworks part number (or if all else fails, email
me).
