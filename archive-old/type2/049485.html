Subject: [T2] 1600 CC &quot;German&quot; Heads are In!

I am happy to say that the 1600cc &quot;German&quot; dual port heads I posted to the
list about 6 weeks ago have arrived!  As promised, I did order a few extra
pair.  I will be able to honor the $99 price (each, plus shipping) that I
had previously projected.  See below for a copy of my original description
of these heads.

To my knowledge, I have now contacted everyone who committed to a set, as I
am holding heads for them.  If you were one of them, and do not receive a
p-mail from me today confirming your interest, please let me know.  You will
get priority over anyone else who orders.

The remainder will be available to listmembers on a first-come, first-serve
basis. You can order toll-free at 1-866-BUS-DEPOT, or via the website, using
part number 043 101 355CK.  Please note that you MUST specify that you are a
listmember to get this price, whether ordering by phone or over the website.
The website will not specify that they are the &quot;German&quot; ones (and will list
a $40 higher price), but as long as you specify that you're a listmember you
will get the good ones at the $99 each price.

Thanks,

&gt; I have been offered a really good deal on some new, complete dual port
&gt; 1600cc heads from a supplier in Europe. These are unique because they
&gt; take a bare genuine VW (Brazil) head and assemble it with all new German
&gt; TRW valves, etc.  They build them this way because the quality is better
than
&gt; the 100% Brazilian ones (which is normally all you can get).  This is as
close to
&gt; a brand new German head as you can get.
&gt; Projected price is $99 each plus shipping, give or take a few bucks. The
&gt; only reason the price is so low is that they are overstocked so they are
&gt; giving me a quantity at their cost.  They will take about 6-8 weeks to
arrive.
