Subject: Re: missing at highway speeds

&gt; I'm worrying about a similar problem on my '82 Vanagon Westy.  Last
&gt; night it failed for a couple of seconds while cruising at 45 in fourth
&gt; gear.  I thought I had lugged the engine, but it had just died.  In
&gt; recent months I've had intermittent miss or hesitation at highway speeds
&gt; and have changed the coil and checked the points.  I'm thinking about
&gt; changing the double relay or a least carrying a spare. This is so
&gt; disturbing...I lose confidence in my ride.

--&gt; Could be the double relay; could be just about any loose connection in
the FI system.  In my experience the first thing to check is to make sure
the cylinder head temp. sensor hasn't worked loose.
