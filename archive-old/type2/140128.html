Subject: Mechanic in Central PA?

My brother plans to make a cross country trek from PA to
CA in his '70 campmobile. Can anyone recommmend a vw
mechanic in the Harrisburg area to give it a once over to
check it out before the trip? It runs great and has new
shocks tires and brakes but he'd like to have someone take
a look at anything we've missed.

Thanks!

Andrew
