Subject: Re:[T2] Bay Window Rust &amp; Leaks

cliff - straight up, i think wcm stinks up and down the block. low  
quality flimsy waste product. i think a big mistake i made was to re- 
use a windshield gasket made by wcm. it is leaking inbetween the  
glass and rubber, so i am breaking out the NOS gaskets. i used an NOS  
german gasket last week on my 69 sunroof. here are the highlights:  
the nos gasket was so hard to put on; grippy beyond belief. by the  
time i got done putting the seal on, my finger tips felt like the  
prints were burned off. it took me over 45 minutes just to put the  
seal around the glass. the form of the seal replicated the glass!  
installation of the glass and gasket into the bus was impossible. i  
tried, with help, on two occasions during the rest of the day. short  
of slathering it with goopage i paid a local glass installer $45 to  
pop it in. he couldn't do it alone on late last friday. too  
difficult. with the glass installed 80%, i drove it home and returned  
today to have it pulled and re-installed and the ordeal seems over.  
we'll see what this week's rain brings. i hope to return with another  
gasket on the glass for my 68 doublecab, but i think i ought to give  
the installers a break for a bit. if they charge $45 again i'd fall  
over. moral of the story is to get on german ebay, learn a little  
german, and call it good. with one bid on a cab door gasket i prodded  
and bought 3 nos windshield gaskets, a doublecab rear door nos  
gasket, and a couple nos front cab gaskets for $165.  hopefully,  
that'll keep me away from wcm for a long enough time.  - steve
