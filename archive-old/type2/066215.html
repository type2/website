the biggest change was the change from 1968 -&gt;1973 was the change from a nicer &quot;lighter coloured pseduo 
birch&quot;  woodgrain (IMHO) in 1972,  to the uglier and darker (IMHO) woodgrain.

as well in and around late 1972 they switched from from the &quot;baby poop&quot; yellow vinyl upohlstrey (i can never 
spell that word) to the one year only (an horribly ugly IMHO) &quot;butterscotch&quot; polyester upohlstrey

I have also seen 1973 westy's that have white cabinet handles instead of the more common black ones

other than that the interior layout was virtually identical
