Subject: Sliding door rust

Hey.
    What can be done about rusted (to the point of nonexistence) lower
sliding door channels?  Mine works, but it's really tough to do, and I'm
the only one who can do it.  The inner wall of the channel is gone
toward the front of the bus, so I have to open the door halfway, pull
out on the bottom (not too far!!) and then open the door the rest of the
way.  I can tell that it gets worse every time.

    Is there some kind of kit or repair piece available for this?  I
worry about just taking it to a body shop and letting them rig up
something based on what is there.  I'd rather have a piece to weld in.
Do they sell them, or do I need a donor bus?  Anyone have a donor '77
with a good body for cheap (yeah right)?

Thanks.
