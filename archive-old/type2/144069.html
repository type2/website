&gt; Anyone with any engine mechanical experience wanna come over this

Sure!  I'd love to come!  Where?  Are you buying the airline ticket or am
I?  Seiously, if you are within an hour or so of Washington, DC, then,
yes, I can come.  If you are in Fourecks (aka Australia), probably not.

&gt; I replaced all the fuel lines from the filler neck to the injectors
&gt; and now she wont run.

OK. Basic diagnosis:

1. Do you have fuel?

Pull an injector off the intake manifold, point it at a cup and crank for
a while.  If there is no fuel in the cup, let me know.

2. Do you have air?

Breath in, breath out.  Remove the air tube from the throttle body and
check for a rag.  take the air tube off the air filter housing and check
for a rag.  Open the air filter housing and look hard at the filter....
replace the filter.  Reassemble.  Check all the connections and all the
vacuum lines.  Hook a vacuum gauge to the engine.  Even while cranking you
should draw &gt; 5&quot; of vacuum.  Running it should be 15&quot; or better but

3. Do you have compression?

Remove all the spark plugs and test the compression in each cylinder.
Minimum is 90psi with 10% difference between high and low.

4. Do you have spark?

Hook up a dwell/tach and make sure that it registers.  Nothing quite as
embarasing as having a wire off the coil.  Check for spark at the plugs
with a screwdriver up the wire end and close to ground.  Rotate the engine
to TDC and check the static timing.  Should be at ~7.5BTDC.


If you do all these things then the engine will start.  If not, then it
won't.

OOK!
