I just wanted to say thank you to all of the people who
responded to my question about busses with FI. There were so
many of you that I'm afraid I don't have time to write each
of you a note.

You all basically confirmed my previous belief that all
busses after 74 had FI. That's why I was so confused by the
Haynes manual.

Again, thank you,

Jerm
