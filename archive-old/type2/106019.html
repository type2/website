Subject: Re: [T2] pulling a bus

Guys,

I have an 81 vanagon sitting in my drievway that *has* a front
tow bar...since it is a parts car, I haven't looked at how it is attached 
yet(welded or bolted).  We pulled it home with the hitch setup and it 
worked great.

I can take some pics and if it would fit a bay, it should be obvious.

It would be for sale!...weighs a ton though.

Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt; I saw an RV running down I-40 in middle Tn one day dragging a Westy for a
&gt; support vehicle. Was far from being able to see the hitch.
&gt; 
&gt; I'll stop by some of the local RV places here and see if I can learn
&gt; something about it.
