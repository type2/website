&gt; Previous Owner: a derogatory term used to describe the kind of person who
&gt; would rip off all the fuel injection, swap the engine into another vehicle
&gt; to cause you confusion. ;-)

Ohhhhh...

You mean like the PO who put the '74 engine into the '76 Gremlin that I
bought.

After I finally figured it out, I had to rewire the harness to match the
engine, then remember which end of the car that I was ordering parts for
when at the parts store.

Having paid only $25.00 for the car and gotten 4-5 years of service out of
it, more than made up for the interesting anatomy!
