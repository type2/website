Subject: RE: knuckle slammer shifter

&gt;From: stevo &lt;stevo_at_efn_dot_org&gt;
&gt;my shifting is pretty tight, not much slop. inspection of the rod coupler
&gt;shows it is mildly wollowed out and worn, so i'll change it now. but is
&gt;there more to be done to avoid hitting the e-brake and such when shiting
&gt;into third?  - steve

I put in one of the &quot;short shift&quot; kits for a beetle. They are the same size 
and bolt right in. My shifter stops about 4 or 5 inches from the dash board 
now. It does make a little hump in the rubber mat though.

Just don't get the el-cheapo $4 ones. They crack and break too easily.
