&gt; heh, heh, heh,
&gt; 
&gt; What did you all put for the 'extra credit essay' at the end, entitled
&gt; 'how do you like your car?' ?
&gt; 
&gt; Here's mine --
&gt; &quot;My bus is like my best friend.
&gt; You could not name a single car in the world that I would swap it for,
&gt; other than to sell that car in order to buy back my bus plus a hundred
&gt; other buses (and maybe a couple Porsche 356's if I had some money
&gt; left over :-)&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Do you think they'll send round the little men in white coats?

Hmmm...that reminds I of a telephone poll that I answered about a
month ago.  It appeared to be one of those 'general' marketing surveys
as they asked questions about several industries. After apparently
shocking the pollster by informing her that I have never been in a
MacDonalds and that I doubted if I would like their food anyways, we
came around to the automotive questions:

Pollster:       How many vehicles do you or your family own?
I:              Three

Pollster:       What make is your first vehicle?
I:              Volkswagen

Pollster:       ...and your second vehicle?
I:              Volkswagen

Pollster:       I suppose that your third vehicle is also a
                Volkswagen?
I:              Yes ;)

Pollster:       What is the year and model of your first Volkswagen?
I:              It is a 1966 Westfalia.
Pollster:       How do you spell that? [I spelled it for her].

Pollster:       ...and the year and model of Volkswagen number two?
I:              A 1992 Jetta
Pollster:       Your second car is newer that your first?
I:              Is that a problem?
Pollster:       No...you are just the first person I have spoken to
                who has a fairly new car, but drives a 30 year old
                car as a first vehicle....

Pollster:       And the third car?...I mean Volkswagen.
I:              A 1974 Thing.
Pollster:       The car is called a &quot;Thing&quot;?
I:              That is correct.
Pollster:       OK.

Pollster:       Just one more question.  If you were purchasing a new
                vehicle this year what make and model would you
                choose?
I:              by the term &quot;new&quot;, do you mean a 1996 or '97 model or
                just &quot;new&quot; to I?  You see, I have never bought a &quot;new&quot;
                car...always second hand.
Pollster:       New to you is fine.
I:              Then the answer is simple... a 1952 Deluxe
                Microbus...a Samba model.
Pollster:       This is a Volkswagen, right?
I:              Not a Volkswagen [grinning]...the Volkswagen.
Pollster:       I am sure 'they' weren't expecting this answer.
                Thank-you for your time...it has been most
                interesting.

Of course, I ma sure that my survey form was round-filed the moment
she hung-up and the coffee break talk was about this 'weirdo' who has
never been to MacDonalds and would rather purchase a 1952 Microbus
rather than a new car....;)

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Splits...Oh, my!
