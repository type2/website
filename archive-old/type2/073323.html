Ouch.  Your compression must be way up there.  Do you have temp gauges?

&gt;I am assuming the little bits of wet soot being spit out of the tailpipe at
&gt;idle are unburnt hydrocarbons which means i'm running rich.

&gt;1. Am i running too rich?

Assume nothing.  Go to a chassis dyno and have your A/F ratio measured
under load with a wideband 02 meter.

&gt;1. Will a less restrictive exhaust cure it?

It might help a little, and it sounds like you need a new exhaust anyway.

&gt;3. Isn't running a little rich OK  in a vw - esp on a type4?

Depends on your definition of &quot;a little&quot;.  I would think 12 to 1 A/F would
be rich enough to keep your engine cool and still run reasonably clean and
efficient.  If you're running 10 to 1, that's way too rich and your mileage
and power will fall off.  You won't know until you have it tested.

The easiest way to modify your A/F ratio is to change the main jet in the
carb.  You could tell the list what size you are running and maybe a Weber
expert could suggest a better size for your combo.
