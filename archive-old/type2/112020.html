Hello all. It Time for the only campout in Delaware once again. Buses and Punkin Chunkin will be held on Oct. 31st thru Nov. 2nd. It will be held a Holly lakes campground once again. It a little pricey but it the most convenient campground to the Punkin Chunkin Event. (punkinchunkin_dot_com) for more info on it. To get directions go to hollylakescampsites_dot_com or contact me at bugnut1_at_prodigy_dot_net
It is a very laid back event with no real itinerary. Just come and go as you wish.
We wll have a potluck dinner on Sat. night about 6:00 and maybe a Breakfast feast on Sun. Morning. There is no need to make reservations the campground has plenty of room. When you check in tell them you are with the VW group or give them my name.
Thanks, Dave Parsons
