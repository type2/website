Subject: Re: [T2] Generator Swap 30 AMP for 38 AMP




&gt;I always use a 30 amp generator in a bus. But remember to also
&gt;use a 30 amp regulator, or it will burn out. Never had an
&gt;amperage problem even on long night trips, and the 30 amp
&gt;stuff is easy to find since the bugs use them.
&gt;
I always use a 38 amp generator. Make sure you have the right back plate 
when you use a 38 amp g.
