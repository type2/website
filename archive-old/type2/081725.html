Subject: Oil Sump / Cyl. Head temperatures

Hi Gentlemen,

1.  Thanks for all your comments and suggestions, &amp; I'm glad that my =
inquiry has started a very interesting discussion among experts...

2. Jst to clarify things that otherwise could be overlooked:=20
    - As Adrian Pillow has reminded us that oil in the heads does reach =
a higher temp than what is reported in the sump by the gauge.....   What =
would be my heads' temp if the oil sump read 165-170 F ?
 - Steve Dolan said the ideal oil temp is about 210-220 F, I guess =
that's at the CHT reading, am I correct ?=20
 - To Andrew Wood: my bus is only 1600, and only has undergone several =
modification/replacement of cam / crank, oil way, valve seats,  valves, =
etc. ( you can always check with my previous posting in which I =
submitted my engine specs and enquired if someone could tell how much HP =
the engie can produce.....) but, thanks, I've decided to use no more =
than  one oil cooler.=20

Thank again,

Torry Parantoro
