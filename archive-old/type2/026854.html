Just got done cutting out &quot;most&quot; of my rusty old cargo floor and a couple of 
spots on the nose on my 72. Just ordered a big order from Wolfsberg West for 
all of the crossmembers, outriggers, jacking points, inner/outer rocker 
panels , lower part of sliding track, and some patch panels. All will be 
replaced. This is the biggest project I've ever taken on in my life. I'm 
enjoying it though. Take a look -&gt;

Thanks for looking,
