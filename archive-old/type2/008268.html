&gt; Comming from my assumption the fuel filler neck. (I put on a new gas
cap to
&gt; no avail)
&gt;     My problem is this, How do I get to the fuel filler neck without
pulling
&gt; the engine or cutting into the firewall?????

Look in the engine bay and find the big round disk like plug on the
right side behind the battery.(looks like a frisbee) Pull it off and
the filler is behind it. The hard part is finding a new hose, I have
heard they are not availible. Get this fixed before the thing goes up
in flames.
Good Luck.
