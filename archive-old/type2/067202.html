It IS supposed to shut off the fuel flow when the ignition is shut 
off or the wire falls off.  CAUTION  CAUTION, when the ignition 
switch is ON that wire is HOT.  Hot wire + ground = SPARKS.  Need I 
say more?  Oh well, I will, Sparks + Fuel = toast.

If the fuel shut-off is loose and not fully seated in the carb, lack 
of electrical grounding will also cause intermittent fuel shut-off.  

Worn solenoid cut-off valve (as I prefer to call it) or loose fit 
into carb can allow fuel to flow even when no power is applied.

If you have the opportunity to re-wire use lots of shrink wrap tubing to 
cover ends of spade connectors in case of wires coming loose.
(Sorry for the plural, used to dual carbs!)

&gt; So now the question is, what does the fuel shutoff valve do?  I know it designed to
&gt; prevent diselling, but I thought it was supposed to prevent the car from running
&gt; altogether?!?!
