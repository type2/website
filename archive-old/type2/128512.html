Subject: Re: [T2] misfire testing results

I'm mystified that it would run smoothly on #1 and #2 alone. Shows you 
how much I know.

Anyhow, have you checked for vacuum leaks in the line to the brake 
servo? I wouldn't be surprised if the L-shaped rubber thingie is 
cracked or isn't sealing properly--the connector that fits on the 
manifold near #3.

I don't know if this is kosher but a little squirt of carb cleaner 
directly on the fitting should tell you if there is a leak. If the 
engine speed changes when you do the squirt, you've got an intake leak.

And that's all I know about that.

&gt; back and pulled #1 and #2 and it ran kinda crappy on that side (not as 
&gt; well as running on #1 and #2 and there were a few thumps here and 
&gt; there.
&gt;
&gt; So, I'm thinking maybe an exhaust leak on the driver's side?  Any 
&gt; thoughts on what to do next?
