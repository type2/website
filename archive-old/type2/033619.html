Subject: Re: Whirring noise in back

Thanks everyone,
  I guess I really need to take a look at what I've got back there and make 
some decisions about either FI, new motor(trade) or whatever is least 
painful. Now that you mention it it floods out very easily (excess 
pressure?). Don't think I want to meet the DPO anymore except to find out 
what else has been monkeyed with.
Tahnks again
