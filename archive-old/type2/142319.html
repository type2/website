&gt;     How do I know how much pressure to run my air tools at?  Is there a 
&gt;rule of thumb for the general amount of pressure for each tool (DA, Air 
&gt;Ratchet, Impact Wrench, Cut Off Tool, etc.), or do you just run everything 
&gt;at full pressure?  This one seems to be maxing out at around 100 PSI, 
&gt;although, I think it could do better.  Is there any reason to dial it back 
&gt;for some things?

You need to set the regulator to the tool psi requirement. Sounds like you inherited a lot of tools with the compressor?

&gt;     Most of the tools I have say to oil daily.  What do I oil them with?  
&gt;Is there some special air too oil?  How much do I drop in?

Air tool oil. Normally you add a few drops in the air inlet of the tool before use.

&gt;     Anything else you can think of to extend the life of the 
&gt;tools/compressor that I should know?

Don't run it constantly. This depends on the task but it's usually the high CFM requirement tasks that are hard on the compressor: HVLP painting, sandblasting etc.
 
The pressure condenses the moisture in the air that the compressor inhales. You must use the drain valve everytime.

Everytime, make sure there is oil visible in the glass sight before you turn it on.

&gt;Each tool has a rating for air consumption, but I believe that is a
&gt;minimum requirement for it to function, not a maximum.

It's often advertizing to get you to buy the tool for your tool small compressor. Only later do you discover you have terrible duty cycle because the tool requires so much CFM to run full time.
