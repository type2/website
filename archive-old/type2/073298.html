David Goldberg,

(I could not find your address)


Do they look anything like the set at:
http://www.insync_dot_net/~kittman/images/0211_007.jpg

Do you have an image?

What is RMMW?








  I have the ones from RMMW.  I personally think they are rather nice.
Not original by any stretch of the imagination, but nice, and relatively
easy to install nonetheless.  They have a rubber bumper that runs around
the outside, and nylon netting stretched accross.  They will require  that
you drill a couple of holes for bolts, so use some form of rust
preventation around the holes.

  Just my $.02.

  Cheers,
  --
