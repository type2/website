the fiberglass conversion ones something different to avoid confusion with

My first bus was a 71 &quot;Bubble Top&quot; (least that's what I used to call it).  I
loved that bus.  I once saw one while on a camping trip and it had a really
neat dingy row boat that fit perfectly on top (over) of the bubble top.  The
guy said it was a dealer option.  I lost that bus to a stupid driver that
turned left immediately in front of me at a green light.   What an A**HOLE!
She was driving a brand new Nissan Sentra and that car was in much worse
condition than my bus was after the accident.  I was doing about 35 MPH and
she just pulled out in front me and turned left, coming from the oppisite
direction.  I was practically a head on collision.  The bus did real well
but the damage was still serious.  The insurance paid me $2000 and let me
keep it, so I pulled the motor and the tranny and got another one but it was
passanger model.  I miss that bubble top 71...
