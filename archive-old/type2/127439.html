Subject: Type 4 valve adjustment

I too have noticed this. I found that if I adjusted
the valves at their loosest point the compression was
down a little. I think this indicated that the valve
adjustment was too tight. Since then I always set the
valves at exactly TDC. I guess the base circle on the
cam isn't exactly round. I read somewhere that this
allows more oil to enter the area between the cam lobe
and lifter.

&gt; My '77 bus has the valves set per the procedures.
But while turning 
the
&gt; engine over by hand I noticed that at other points
in the cycle the 
gap
&gt; increases - by a lot (like to .050). Is this normal?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
