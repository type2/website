&gt; &gt; what was the problem, felt around a bit and declared something to be broken,
&gt; &gt; but the tie rods were ok.

I too had the mount for the center bushing break clean off the '76
this is a quite common and terrifying method of failure on Buses in
the rust belt.  Happened to me in gradual turn at 35 mph, all of a
sudden heading for other lane and all the turning in the world
did nothing.  I have even see this break off Buses with the rest of
the beam and shock towers relatively rust free.  On the '76 I tried
fabbing my own replacement but gave up and bought a used southern beam.
I really rec everyone, drill a couple of holes in th sheet metal
stamping beside the bushing and inject some rust preventative up in
there, and into your shock tower insides.  Parts Place says pump em all
full of grease but I feel that the lack of drainage would still be
a problem.
