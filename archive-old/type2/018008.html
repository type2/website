&gt; About 11 months ago I went to Tires Plus and said I needed tires for my '72
&gt; westy. &quot;I have just the tire for you&quot; He set me up with these low profile
&gt; 195s with a load rating of 1120 lbs.  At the time I did not know the
&gt; difference --  My speedometer was off and these tire really did not look
&gt; right.  When I took the van out of storage this spring one of the tire was
&gt; flat, so I put on the spare.  This really highlighted wrong these tires
&gt; were.
&gt; 
&gt; So here I am 11 months later with these tire I do not feel comfortable
&gt; with -- I decide to try to return them.  I spoke Charlie, the manager tires
&gt; plus.  To my surprise he apologized, gave my full credit for my tires and
&gt; ordered me a set of reinforced Michelin MX 185R14.
&gt; 
&gt; While I was disappointed that this happened in the first place, I was quite
&gt; pleased at how well they took care of the situation.
&gt; 
&gt; The Tires? They ride nice, my speedo works and rated at 1520 lbs.

I'm not surprised! Tires Plus here would only quote me on the Michelin
205/70-14 C6PR original equipment type for my 87 with alloys. The guy
said &quot;as long as the right tires are available, that's all we'll quote!&quot;
I was impressed- no one else locally even knew about special tires for
our cars.
