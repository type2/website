Subject: Engine tin gap, Back-side--

Actually IF the gap is between the Fire wall and  the motor--Its  a good thing! as the air
that IS coming in to the engine compartment is Not the Hot exhaust air--Some people i know
actually create an opening there--It gives the air coming in a &quot;Turbo&quot; effect. I know many
will tell you to Seal the engine compartment the best you can  Which IS a good thing--But
from my experience with heat in Phoenix--
This &quot;Turbo&quot; air coming in--on the firewall side of the motor--really works--TWWM, uj
