Subject: Re: [T2] front mounted tires.

I took converted my mount from backside forwards to hubcap side forward 
easily and cheaply.

I took three pieces of pipe and threaded them the same as the studs on the 
mount. I then added three short pieces of thread rod --- essentially 
lengthened the studs. Now I can place the spare on the front and use a 
hubcaps to cover the lug nuts (and lock) and the tire sits on the bumper 
instead of hanging on the nose entirely.

Cost? $10 maybe.

And my tire is not there for crash protection, just a good place to store 
the tire (especially since I use the inside cabinet area for either another 
spare or just junk).

Ciao!
