When we last left our superhero he was suffering defeat at the hands of
Murphy.

Here's the recap
Rebuild my own engine, all by meself, (not true, all of you were there)

Anyhoo, now I've determined it wont crank because it's not getting
fire.  All else was there, compression, fuel.

Well, pulled the #1 plug, found TDC looking at the valves.  The dizzy
was 180 degrees out.  It can't be rotated enough to time properly.
Pulled the dizzy and my manuals. The offset is towards the pulley end,
almost perpendicular to the engine centerline.  I checked and rechecked
this while installing the drive gear.  Since this is a rebuilt
distributor, is it possible the gear on the end of the distributor shaft
is out 180 degrees?  Could I just rotate this gear?  If not, how do you
remove the gear without tearing down the engine and loosing the shims?

Please Help.  This has gone on long enough.
