&lt;&lt; maybe someone out there has possibly been through this or something like 
this
 and so can give me some insight.   &gt;&gt;

I think I can answer this one. Back in April I sold a Westy I had owned for 
three years. It was a basket case when I bought it, in pretty fair condition 
when I sold it. I went out and bought a (used) Chevy conversion van. Now, 
this Chevy has HEAT, AIR CONDITIONING, 4 reclining captains chairs and a fold 
out bed. It also has a color TV and video cassette player. It has more 
horsepower than anyone could ask for. But, it ain't a Westy. I missed the old 
Westy. And I knew I'd miss all the wonderful people I'd met over the last 
three years that own buses/Westy's. Now, I'm not a college student, I'm 42. 
Not bragging, but I could pretty much drive anything I want to (within 
reason, I'm not loaded). Sitting in my garage right now is a '77 Westy I 
bought 2 weeks ago. I'm already in love again! I'm already calling this one 
the &quot;Forever Westy&quot; because I'm saying I'll never sell this one (My wife is 
laughing). But I'm serious-think it over very carefully. I sold mine and 
regretted it. I was lucky enough to find another in pretty decent shape. They 
ain't making any more of them, and prices keep going up. Good luck whatever 
you decide.  Jeff S.
