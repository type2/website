Subject: Temporary Fix For Torn CV Boot
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hey Everyone--

Thank you to everyone who has responded to my requests the past couple of 
days--sorry to have so many--I'm just getting ready for the big haul up 
North--hopefully I will get decent weather. I would like to hear about any 
ideas to temporarily fix a torn CV boot--all three of the boots are 
fine--except for one---and I was just curious if anyone had any &quot;Duct Tape&quot; 
type fixes until I get up North--Thanks for the help---Adam

P.S,.--I'm still searching for the culprit of my oil loss---my friend/guru 
thought it maybe the pressure that is causing such a drastic 
leak--considering my compressions really good--and we just replaced rear main 
seal--and crankshaft seal--so I am experiencing with driving without my oil 
cap on--any thoughts?
