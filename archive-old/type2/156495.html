Subject: [T2]running hot update

well maybe just maybe we have gotten somewheres yall...
   
  changed condensor out today and points and checked and running at 23 (8cylinder scale)
   and timing is dead on 7.5bftdc
   
  it is very hot out today and hotter than it was couple of weeks ago when i started seeing this as a problem...
   
  the bus is doing well.. the temp is back to normal temps... running at a bit over 220 in traffic and little under 220 on the highway..... sounds good to me and where she was at before the problems...
   
  there seems to be a smoothness now to driving her instead of what she felt like with the bad condensor .....
   
  now lets hope it all stays good and the points dont burn up or anything...
   
  also the all holes have been sealed for the engine compartment...alone that has to make a big difference....
   
  still though she is stuttering when you shut off the engine on hot 
   
  Positive vibes huuuuummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm~!~ LOL
   
  want to thank you all for your input ....
  Thanks also to phil who is always a light ...............
   
   
  peace

     Tune up the Bus wash off the winter rust~!~
