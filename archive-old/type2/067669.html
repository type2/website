Subject: Bus, Carpets, Stereo...Update &amp; *THANKS*!

OK, that sthe weekend gone...so heres an update for those of you who are
interested...

As you may remember, my '68 Devon was in many small pieces.  I posted
several questions on the list, including carpetting and speaker
positions.

I spent  the weekend putting the bus back together.  The carpet worked
great...no problems at all.  I fixed it down with double-sided tape.  I
also put carpet under the cab seats....reduces noise, and gives an air
of completeness...it looks good.

The stereo works great too.  I put the CD changer in one of the bulkhead
cupboards, and the stero itself in the cab (obviousuly!).  The
speaker...I put 2 3ways in the front by passgrs and drivers feet, and 2
2ways at the top of the rear.  Sounds fantastic!!

So THANKS to everyone who helped me out with advice....

OK, so now to the catch - isn't there always one...?! 

The only problem that has arisen over the weekend is that now the
indicators and brake lights, and horn have stopped working.  Looks like
the problem is at the back.  Everytime I switch on an indicator, the
number 1 fuse goes - I know, this is the fuse that runs the horn etc.
too - the horn doesn't work either!

Any ideas???

Thanks again folks!

Jonathan.
