Subject: RE:  My 914 bus/longish

&gt;to replace ($500/set).  The valves in the heads are also more expensive than
&gt;their VW counterparts so if you need head work done, it may cost a little
&gt;more.  But the power difference is substantial and you WILL notice a smaller
&gt;engine!!

I'd note on Mike's point here, that the valves (sodium filled) are no more expensive
than putting sodium filled valves in Bus heads like all 1.7's SHOULD have, but
nobody puts them in Bus heads now days, and I'd be real doubtful any of the bulk
builders put them in 914 heads unless you request and pay for them.  A total FWIW
is that GPR (German Parts and Resto) can get the 1.8 and bus 2.0 sodium exhausts
at quite reasonable prices, about $20 a pop last I checked, when others might ask
even $50 each or more.  I have found no source but VW for the wasserboxer sodium
exhausts, and AVP, MS, whoever don't supply em.  Sort of always makes you wonder,
people who don't like to supply the sodium valves decry them as &quot;old technology&quot; and
not of value, even say they transfer too much heat through to the guide too quickly. But
VW was still putting them in wasserboxers in '92, &quot;common logic&quot; versus the company
that made the cars, U all be the judge.  As far as substantial power difference from the
better head design and slight CR bump, well you can easily build your bus 2.0 at the
same or higher CR, not an issue, VW didn't, buses weigh 2 tons, 914's don't.  VW also
recced DROPPING your CR to something under 7:1 in the tech bulletins in the 80's.  I
have no opinion on this one, last 2.0 I put together was at 7.5:1, runs better than it did
when it was at less, how I've affected longetivity, I don't know.  Also as a total aside I'll
say that genuine GERMAN Mahle flat top pistons for the 914 2.0 are about the cheapest
set of German P&amp;L's you can buy, about $400 from precision? online last fall last I looked.
However these would go together at quite a CR so unless you knew what you were doing
and took measures with volume in the head, not a great idea.  I intended to use them as
the basis of a stroker though where I would have been turning them down anyway.  To the
origional poster I strongly agree, have the 914 if indeed it is a 914 built to stock specs
(or maybe a hare conservative CR) and don't dare consider a 1.7.  Only possible
downside of this ever is finding the proper FI intake runners, if you have carbs on it, not
usually a problem.
