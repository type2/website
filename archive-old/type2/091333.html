&gt;   Today I went to the Grand Canyon to rescue a bus that hit an ELK. When the
&gt; owner called and asked if I would go get it I said sure. I was told that she
&gt; had just hit it (the ELK), but upon picking it up she not only hit the 500
&gt; lb. buck but rolled her bus also. Wait till I post pics. It's amazing that
&gt; she came out OK, I would have thought someone would have died in the
&gt; collision. Just goes to show that our buses can hold there own against some
&gt; big old buck.

Just curious, was she driving at night or during the day?  I've sworn off
driving at night in the boonies after my deer encounter with my
Dad's C*evy.
