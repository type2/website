&gt; Since I didn't get the original post I don't have all the details,
&gt; but are teh
&gt; recently-installed heads from AVP?  I was dealing with a Bus just
&gt; last week


it is indeed an AVP head I just got from them last week

&gt; that had basically no compression on the 1/2 (passenger) side with fresh
&gt; AVP heads.  The bump above the top cylinder fin was contacting the
&gt; ring around the cylinder bore in the head before the sealing surfaces
&gt; made contact.  No headgaskets (sealing rings) were used per the late
&gt; factory recommendation to not use them anymore.

which is how I installed them.

&gt; Checked the depth and they were flycut too deep relative to Bentley
&gt; specs, which resulted in a call to AVP the next day when we were told
&gt; that their rebuilt heads are &quot;designed&quot; to be used with gaskets, which
&gt; they overnighted at no charge.  Partial teardown to install the gaskets
&gt; took teh compression up to 110 on that side, good enough for an
&gt; engine that'll need a rebuild in another 20k anyway.
&gt;
&gt; .. all of which could've been avoided with a slip of paper in the boxes
&gt; mentioning that headgaskets are needed. :-/


duh! yeah, I have a bunch of new head gaskets in a box in the garage I
suspect you are right and if I can get away with only pulling the head
enough to slip a &quot;Couple&quot; of them in there I will try that first, tighten
em down and see if that gets em &quot;tight&quot; I would be happy with 110 since
this engine will be rebuilt in 20-25k also.

heck I didn't even get an invoice in the box or a core return paper.
would have been nice to be told, or if expected they should have included
the gaskets or as you say at least mentioned they needed them.
