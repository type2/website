Subject: Re: [T2] Proper Time?

Hello,

I too have a 74 bus. When I first bought it, I knew
that it needed engine work ( carbs, distributor, tune
up, points, push rod tube seals, fluid change, ect),
but I figured that I should fix up the body first then
work on the engine. I went about trying to fix every
problem that it had on the body and I regret it. I
haven't drove the bus since it was driven home 3 years
ago. If I could start over again, I would have made it
road worthy first, then start on the body. I say this
because, My bus got to the point that I couldn't move
it across the yard due to lack of attention to the
drive train. If you choose to work on the engine first
and are forced to remove the engine, this gives you a
chance to fix the rust in the engine compartment which
is a plus as well. This way, when you are finished
with the engine, brakes, ect, you can fix the body a
section at a time and still drive to work. That was my
2 cent worth. Thanks!

&gt; &gt; Hello all...I am in the process of restoring a
&gt; 1974 bus that I got when my 
&gt; &gt; brother died.  I used to drive it all the time
&gt; until it needed work.  Now I 
&gt; &gt; am in the process of fixing everything that is
&gt; wrong with it...the problem 
&gt; &gt; is...I'm eager to drive it...chipped paint and
&gt; all...My question is...would 
&gt; &gt; it be out of line to drive it or should I wait
&gt; until I have it fixed 100% to 
&gt; &gt; drive it?
&gt; 
&gt; drive it if it pleases you.
&gt; 
&gt; there are different kinds of folks
&gt; 
&gt; . the restore it faithfully
&gt; . the drive it til the rust wins
