Subject: the logic behind the 12-point tool

In addition to knowing which tool to use for a certain application,
I'm the type who also likes to know *why* that tool is used.  I've
been thinking about the lovely and talented &quot;tri-square&quot; 12-point tool
used for CVs, and I've got a question.

If you look at a common 12-point socket, it obviously has 12 points,
just like the tri-square tool.  In order for it to fit a six-sided
bolt head though, these 12 points are obviously created by overlaying
2 hexagons at a 30-degree angle to each other.  The result is a
12-point star where all the angles are 120 degrees (that is, the 24
faces that form the 12 points are all at 120 degrees to each other).

The shape of the &quot;triple-square&quot; tool is created by overlaying three
squares at 30-degree angles to each other.  The result is a 12-point
star where any two faces that form a point are at a 90-degree angle to
each other, but any two faces that form a &quot;valley&quot; are still at a
120-degree angle.

Now the question: Does the triple-square tool have some advantage over
the common 12-point arrangement in terms of being able to apply
torque?  Is it better than an Allen wrench?


Looking for logic in all the wrong places...
