Subject: [T2] VW part number for spacers

Would someone please be so kind as to tell me the VW part numbers for 
cylinder spacer shims for an 1800 T4 engine? I would like the numbers for 
.060&quot; thickness and .090&quot;. If there is one at .100&quot; I'd appreciate that as 
well.

P;ease answer directly, as I am not receiving the list, even though I am 
supposedly subscribed to the digest. My posts do go through, I just don't get 
the list messages.

Cheers/Don Carron
