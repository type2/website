&gt;What a vacuum advance dist. can do for you is back off the timing when the

I'm sorry, but this is not how a vacuum advance distributor works.  A
vacuum advance distributor provides the *most* advance when you have your
foot to the floor.  You are confusing carburator vacuum with manifold
vacuum.  Manifold vacuum only comes into play when you have a dual-vacuum
distributor - it is hooked to the vacuum retard side of the canister.  But
even with a dual vacuum distributor, maximum advance is still provided when
your foot is on the floor.

&gt;Helps keep the keep engine a little cooler, prevent
&gt;pinging, and generally last a little longer. Power wise? It's a small
&gt;difference - seat of your pants thing. A vacuum dist. may not make as much
&gt;power on a hill but the engine lasts longer for it. Again, a seat of the
&gt;pants thing.

If you have it timed properly for the distributor you are running, you will
not lose any power at all, nor will you run cooler.
