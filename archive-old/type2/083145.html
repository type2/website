Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Heat

Hello,

I thought I would comment on the subject of stock bus
heat exchangers. I recently removed the left head and
heat exchanger of my 73 type 1v bus. I am in the
process of having work done to my heads and thoght I
would take the opportunity to restore my heat
exchangers. I first cleaned, and cleaned and cleaned
the left heat exchanger, removing all traces of oil
and grime that I could. I then pried apart the two
halves of the heat exchanger and removed the pipes
from inside. I then cleaned the inside areas of these
three parts. Being in an automotive class, I took
these pieces to the bead blaster and bead blasted the
top half. I then cleaned this piece and painted it
with high temp exhaust paint. So far so good. Once I
get these three pieces blasted and refinished, I will
crimp the halves back together, and tack welding the
seam every inch or so. I will weld in patches over a
couple of rusted through holes and then weld patches
around where each pipe of the manifold comes out the
exchanger to seal off the box. Lastly, I will grind
the welds somewhat smooth, seal the seams with exhaust
sealant and repaint the entire assembly. I should have
it done in acouple mor classes. Any way, have a great
day!

&gt; Hi Everybody!
&gt; One of the previous owners of my '78 Westy gutted
&gt; the heating system, all
&gt; that remains are the naked fins of the heat
&gt; exchangers. I am wondering how
&gt; well the stock system worked in the first place, is
&gt; it worth replacing all
&gt; those pricey bits?
