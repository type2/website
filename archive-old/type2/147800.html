&gt;Has anyone found a good 12v pump that is compact enough and powerful

I'll have to try and snap some pix of my setup today.  I used the stock resevoir
and a washer pump from a 924.  Ran a hose from the bottom nipple on the 
bottle to the pump, took the hose off the upper nipple for venting.  Mounted the
pump near the fusebox, hanging off one of the screws on the end of the 
fresh-air ducting.

I did have it a little easier than I could have -- some months ago I kludged a 
Rabbit wiper/turnsignal switch set into the steering column of my Bus and 
that was already designed for an electric washer pump.
