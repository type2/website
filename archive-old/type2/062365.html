Up to four Asstonites, huh... Hi Eddie! If the other two O' you let
yerselves be known,
perhaps festivities could be planned... day trips, labor sharing, BS
sessions. Still
trying to contact the owner of a nice 65 hardtop named &quot;Einie&quot; and drag him
on here.
Any of you  other Texans know who he is?
