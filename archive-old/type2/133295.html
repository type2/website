Subject: Re: [T2] Hydraulic lifters - mistake to replace?

&gt; I think it is almost funny that these lifters are called &quot;hydraulic
&gt; lifters&quot;.  They are a terrible design.  What other vehicle can you let sit
&gt; for a few days and then the lifter rattles like crazy for a while until it

the older Subaru's had a similar problem, my Father in laws rattled like
crazy when first started up, probably for the same reason, a flat engine
design

&gt; was pumped up.  I wonder how many owners of these vw's drove a vehicle with
&gt; a more substantial problem only to think it was a noisy lifter.

probably a bunch, but if the lifter doesn't quiet down pretty quick you
check, besides mine is a daily driver, rarely have much rattle as it
doesn't get to sit too long
&gt;
&gt; At least in my experiences, hydraulic lifters were not an adjust once and
&gt; walk away kinda deal.  Still needed checked now and then..occasionally one

true and I mentioned that I do an annual even if there are no symptoms,
always check if you suspect anything

&gt; I have worked on at least a dozen vans with hydraulic lifters in the last
&gt; few years.......NONE of them had the lifters adjusted right, folks had

TDC, touch then 1.5 turns..

&gt; first thing in tuning any aircooled vw in my opinion.

follow the DM, and checking or adjusting valves is an important step.

&gt; In the few motors i have built, i must say the hydraulic cams really take a
&gt; beating.  They wear out a lot quicker than one would think i suppose due to
&gt; that constant pressure, or over tension depending on how they were adjusted.

??? wonder why that is, I would think the constant pounding of the lifters
against the cam would cause more wear.

&gt; I drive the aircooled cars because i do not mind fiddling with
&gt; them...........one piece at a time.  To think that i can not and drive a 20+
&gt; year old car is not realistic, regardless of the condition of the car.

I don't particularly mind fiddling one piece at a time, just hate having
to do over something I had already done..  and I agree that driving a 20+
year old car can sometimes be an adventure, had my share.
