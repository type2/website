Subject: Re: Lookin into 77/78 Campers

&gt;To further perpetuate this trivial thread, I would suggest:  Does anyone
&gt;have the statistics on hand for early vanagons ('80, '81, etc.)?  If they
&gt;are the same as for the '79, that would further the theory that the '79
&gt;figures are for the vanagon and not the baywindow.

Know what we need? Interior volume, in cubic meters or cubic zirconia or
however you measure volume in German. That would settle the
bumper/mirror/fender/arbitrary federal measuring whim controversy.
