&gt; Hi,

&gt; I have a tiger 581 and have been using platinum plugs. I have not been able
&gt; to prove it but I suspect the plugs are the cause of my drop in mileage. I
&gt; also followed the instructions for gapping plugs, which were pre-gapped
&gt; wider on platinum anyway I noticed. I installed the CDI module and platinum
&gt; plugs at the same time and my power and mileage went down. Starts better
&gt; though. Any comments on plugs and gaps with CDI. Regular or platinum? What
&gt; gap?

Platinum plugs have a smaller electrode than standard plugs.  This allows
the spark to jump at a lower voltage than the larger electrode of a
standard plug, which means that less energy is delivered per spark.

This is OK if the system is designed to use these plugs, but probably
isn't as good if the system isn't designed to do so.
