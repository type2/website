I have a 70 bus,bought it over 3 yrs. ago. It had been stored for 18 yrs. so 
everything was wrong with it. So i'll get to the point. Had never driven a VW
of any kind (ever) so knew nothing about it. Put in a new motor and wanted
everything on it new. Was told by the man that sold me the engine that a 
009 dist. was just as good as the vac. adv. dist. Put it in and have driven it
2 1/2 yrs. very satisfied,until today. Got out the org. dist., replaced 
everything
and installed it. I could not believe the difference. It's like the old saying
if you have never had steak, hamburger is just fine. By the way i still 
haven't
driven ant other VW so can't compare it to anything. I have seen a lot of
threads on this so don't want to start anything.
