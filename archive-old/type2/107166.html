Subject: Fuel tank return fuel nipple (converting to FI)

Hi guys,
I will convert my bus (1.7L) to FI insted of using my new single prog 
Weber, Mike Boland found me a good used and complete 1978 2.0L FI.
The price for the complete FI is more than fair so why not try!!!!!!

Almost everything is out of the bus, so i was ready to remove the fuel 
tank to add a fuel nipple return line for the FI.
But! why not use one of the existing ventilation nipple (look at the 
picture):
http://www_dot_desert2002_dot_com/fuel_tank1.htm

Would the pressure be to much and overflow at the end of that line 
(going into the air filter) instead of going into the tank?

I don't care about removing the tank but i do care about drilling in 
this one.
I think it's a better solution than the inline &quot;T&quot; fitting, hot fuel 
won't return directly to the injection system.
I could also use this nipple without a &quot;T&quot; fitting? If the left nipple 
is use as a return fuel line,  would only one ventilation tube be 
sufficient?

Also, i would appreciate any advice, tricks or comments on those who 
made the conversion to FI.
What other big modification as to be made. The head will be &quot;tap &amp; 
drilled&quot; for the head temp sender.
Is it a problem if the FI was design for a 2.0L, i have a 1.7L

Best regards, Ben
