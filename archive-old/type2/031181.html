what's leaded gas????

not to be funny but the current engine in my bus has never had a drop of
leaded gas in it!  not neccesarily by choice, there just isn't any
avaliable anymore in this part of the USA ($4 gal 105 octane racing or
aircraft fuel excepted)

the Type 4 engine runs just fine on unleaded, and the rebuilt engines have
been modified to run on unleaded, and someone once told me (YMMV) that the
older engines have enough lead in their systems to run for at least
another 100,000 km without adding any.

the lead was a part of the Valve lubricant or something I heard but I have
been told that the VW engines have not needed lead since about 1970.
