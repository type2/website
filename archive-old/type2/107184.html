Subject: Re: [T2] RE: [VB] longblock first start

&gt; If you are turning it over with the starter motor, recommended procedure, and
&gt; you haven't seen oil pressure at the sensor within 15-20 seconds, something is
&gt; really wrong.

Tidbit....
If assembled dry the oil pump can fail to prime itself.
Solution is to prime it by squirting oil in the sender hole
(and maybe turning backward and squirting more).
