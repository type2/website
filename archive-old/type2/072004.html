Subject: Re. AC in Westy


&gt;I'm leery of putting all that equipment on the engine. Has anyone installed
&gt;an A/C unit like you find in motorhomes (all electric - no engine mounted
&gt;compressor)? How much power does one of these puppies take to run?


I put an interesting semi-option to AC in my '79.  It's called a &quot;Fantastic
Fan&quot; and is a 16&quot; roof-top exhaust fan, with an acrylic louvred top (like a
regular vent) -- what I do is, try to park in the shade, then only open a
window on the side that is away from the sun.  I put the fan on &quot;exhaust&quot;
(it's 2-way), and it will actually keep the inside pretty nice, and almost
AC-cool if the whole van is in shade.

While I realize this is not feasible for driving around, esp. in Arizona, I
thought any other westy owners, particularly pet-owners, might be
interested.  With the unit wired to my camper battery, I was able to leave
it on for long periods of time, and it stayed cool enough to keep my dog
happy while we were in &quot;No Dogs Allowed&quot; places.

Just my cool $.02 worth.....

Roger
