&gt;     Lift the arm up to the lock position, now gently rock it back and forth.
&gt; It should come right off. Don't get rough!

What Tommmy describes is exactly what I have done and it has worked 99%
of the time.  By all means try that first, *but* if it does not and you
feel that you are in danger of snapping the shaft, then...

First, soak it in Kroil or other penetrating oil for 24hrs and retry
Tommy's procedure.

Second, take a punch, fold the arm up and apply the punch to the base at
the joint between the base and the folded-up arm.  tap the punch gently
with a mallet.

The arm hub sits on a cone of the output shaft and the cone and arm
originally had splines on them to prevent rotation.  If the nut loosens or
someone fails to tighten it, those splines can get smeared at which point
the only way to get the arm to &quot;stick&quot; is to tighten the nut *way* too
tight.  This plus 20+ years of corrosion can make removal a bit of
living hell.

And when all else fails....  I have never had to go this far, but remember
heat can be your friend :-)  With a cone-in-cone compression lock, heating
the hub should release it quicker than faster.  I have never tried it as I
am afraid of melting some of the plastic and rubber bits back there, but
it has always been in my mind as a last resort.
