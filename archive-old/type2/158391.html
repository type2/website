Subject: Bus Travel Trailer Update

Here is the updated pictures for the travel trailer i bought to tow
behind Hector my 78 Bay Transporter.

http://type2register_dot_com/type2s_photoalbum_filmstrip.cfm?rid=2&amp;paid=24

As you can see by the pics the exterior appeared to be in really good
condition, as did the interior.  As it turns out, the exterior walls
were pretty much being held together by the paneling, while the floor
was held in place by the vinyl tile floor covering.

So, here is my call for help.

Does anyone here know of anyone around me that is capable of doing
this restoration work on the walls and ceiling?

I'll do all the interior myself, I just dont have the facility to
work on the walls and ceiling.  (no garage)

I live in Southern Maryland and would be more than willing to tow her
to someone with in a few states..  I just cant do this before winter,
and I dont think it will withstand the snow well until its fixed.

Also, Im not asking for free help, I really looking for someone to
pay to do this work.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
