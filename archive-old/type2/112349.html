Subject: Re: [T2] paint jobs

 LOL--&quot;Eat Beans&quot;--

You have to pay the piper sooner or later Chris--If you want to keep the
getting older everyday Bus together--

There is nothing wrong with acrylic enamel--
I painted a gazzillon trucks with the stuff--

It just doesn't last as long as the now available good stuff--and I
wears me out thinking of having to do the job more than once--

Ya know what I mean ??--:&gt;)

Later 

TK--

 
Tough to get enough paint on a bus with a rattle can, tough to get get
enouhg paint on there fast enough to cover uniformly, etc. etc. 
I did a cheapie paint job several years ago on my bus for about $300 in
materials and $700 in labor. I paint an acquaintance for the body work
as I did not have the tools and place to work. 
Dumb! He did a fair job but not much better than I could have and I
could have spent the $700 on a used air compressor and cheapie gun
suitable for primer. Labor is expensive. Do it yourself. 
Paint. I use acrylic enamel + hardner. Very basic paint, basic quality,
basic price. I was a newby and did not want to &quot;risk&quot; alot of expensive
paint with my dubious abilities. Next time on the next car (or this one)
I'll try something better (better equipment, better paint). 
Today looks fine, holds out the rust. Not comparable to a new car finish
and not comparable to the OEM paint. Not as good. Better than it's
previous self though. 
If you've got a reasonable budget do it right the first time even if
you've got to eat beans for a while. We had no real budget so we halfway
did it last time. Next though it should be as simple and sanding and
blocking and painting - no collision damage, no rust damage to repair.
