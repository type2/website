Subject: Re: [T2] Type-1 problem with zamboni engine and propane

check vacuum lines, not sure about a type 1 but a type IV will do that
every time

Bob

&gt; folks, gotta friend with a bad zamboni. It has a good
&gt; boston bob engine, single port and runs propane. It
&gt; cleared almost the whole ice and then 10' from the
&gt; gate started to sputter and finally die at the gate.
&gt; it idles ok, but as soon as it gets gas, it dies.
&gt; Kaput. it will run with any one plug wire removed,
&gt; othre than #3. when #3 is out, it dies. This is
&gt; propane, otherwise i would suggest it was a fuel
&gt; filter (filters on propane??) I know nothing about
&gt; propane engines. He maintains it has a full tank of
&gt; fuel. The thing is, it wsa parked for 2 weeks prior to
&gt; use ,if htat helps. hmmmm.
&gt; thanks
&gt; mp
