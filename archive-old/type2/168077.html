Subject: Brakes pulling to the left

Hello, I'm a new member and this is my first question for the group.   I have 
a 1972 bus with disc brakes on the front and drums on the back.  I  have 
inspected the front disc brakes and there is plenty of pad and the rotor  looks to 
be in good shape.  On the back both drums are in good shape and  the shoes 
have plenty of wear left on them.  I adjusted the back shoes to  what I think is 
the proper adjustment.  When I apply the brakes the bus  pulls to the left.
 
Where should I look next?
 
Thanks
Dave
