Subject: Re: [T2] Installed Bentley CD-ROM - FRIDAY

So how would they know if you did not register via internet and just used 
that new number on 5 machines?

Don't worry - somebody will come up with the whole thing for free in a few 
months. (Not that I care - I don't need it really). &lt;grin&gt;

I heard yesterday on NPR that the solution to Sony's new encryption on 
music CD's is foiled by a thin black line from a magic marker around the 
outer edge of the CD....

I just get alot of entertainment from all these fancy encryption efforts 
that last such a short time and then I hear about some cracker fellow that 
breaks the system. It really only keeps the honest people honest like you 
mentioned.

Me? I can use a computer but I know nothing about code.
