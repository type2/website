Subject: Re: flywheel nut

 
&gt; what is the 'easiest' way to get the 36 mm nut that holds the 
&gt; flywheel on a 1600 off?  i tried with a .5 in drive impact.  no 
&gt; luck...

Do like Muir says. Hie thee up to Home Depot and get a four-foot piece of 
channel bar (he says angle iron, I like the channel bar better, looks 
like a little I-beam). Drill two holes so the channel bar bolts up. Stand 
on the channel bar. Strain. Grunt.

&gt; also, the reason my engine needs a rebuild is b/c i dropped a valve.  
&gt; this could have damaged the case, right?

If the cylinder wasn't chewed, I don't see how it could hurt the case.
