Subject: Re: [T2] fuel sender replacement

Willis,

I have had two Vans (70 and 77) that have had access holes cut above the 
fuel tank sender by previous owners. The 70 had two pretty ham handed holes. 
The first was off target.

I have pulled a gas tank on a 77 Bus and it was no fun but I share your 
sense of danger in cutting metal above the tank. I would drain it and blow 
air thu it until all fumes were gone. Also get the location information with 
out cutting test holes.

&gt;Hey,
&gt;has anybody done the replacement without pulling the engine, like the 
&gt;archives suggest.
&gt;The guy says to cut a hole in the body to access it and re cover it with a 
&gt;plastic screw on boat hatch.
&gt;sounds risky to me, but I'd like to know for sure how much gas I have, the 
&gt;needle drops to R after I have a half tank or less.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Also does anybody know a good replacement for the rear table leg on 76-79 
&gt;westys?
&gt;I'm considering buying a peice of conduit and bending it, but don't know 
&gt;the diameter or height to bend at.
&gt;
