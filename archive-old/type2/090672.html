Subject: Re: [T2] WINNER of the ugliest bus comp!!!!

You guys are making me kinda jealous with the ugly bus
talk. I've been wanting to get an ugly one, but only
seem to drag home decent ones. My last two had only a
few oz. of bondo between them. I saw this bus the
other day at a pizza joint. It was a 71 deluxe with a
2/3 roof rack. HAd a 1/3, 2/3 front seat, the drivers
half was mostly primer, the passebger side was a
couple shades of red. I would have traded him straight
across for my rustfree 74 westy but couldn't find the
guy in the restaurant. You guys may think I am crazy
but I think it would be awesome to be able to do crazy
paint jobs and stuff without feeling guilty about
covering a decent looking paint job( only two colors
on the whole bus believe it or not). You guys have I
lot of artistic freedom in my opinion.
If anyone in colorado has an ugly 71 or older bus I
would trade my 74 westy for it.
Later,
Tyler

&gt; If you are going to extend it - might as well go
&gt; another few feet like the 
&gt; Vanagon guy did and have some ROOM!
