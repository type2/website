&gt;     Despite all my effort I could not make it fit and it was close...
&gt; very close.

I did the very same thing the other day from a local hose distributor but
mine is black. I tried heating it in hot water to temporarily strech it and
even put a little oil on it to help it on. I eventually gave up. It is 3/4&quot;
hose. What size did you get?  Time to get out the Dremel!


&gt;     You can see that the hose even has a natural curve to it which made
&gt; it a nice fit.  Check out the result

&gt;     The obvious disadvantages are that it isn't stock and doesn't look
&gt; anything close

Doesn't look bad at all. To bad you couldn't have bought black hose. Then it
would hardly stand out like the blue does. Thanks for the tips!
