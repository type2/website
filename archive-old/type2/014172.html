Subject: Re: [T2] Dist.



&gt; 
&gt; I have a 70 bus. Let me first say that this is the only v w  of any kind i 
&gt; have
&gt; ever driven or ever rode in for that matter. When i bought this bus 3 yrs. ago
&gt; i had to put in a new motor. I wanted everything new on the motor. The man
&gt; at the supply house where i bought the motor and everything else told me
&gt; that the 009 dist. was the best way to go. I assumed that was right, what
&gt; do i know. I have been very satisfied with the dist. but remember I have never
&gt; drove another v w so i can't compare. I decided to get out the vacum advance
&gt; and put new points, cond., rotor and cap.&quot; it don't work.&quot;Put back the 009,
&gt; started the engine and connected the hose of the vac. adv. dist. to vac at the
&gt; carb. It advances wide open at idle. what's wrong?

You're using the wrong vacuum tap on the carb.  You want the one that is connected to the little hole just above the throttle butterfly.

IIRC, the correct vacuum tap is the one that comes out of the left side of the carb on most Solex carbs.

Also, some vacuum carbs have to be timed with a timing light.  Check Bentley for specs.  I know that if I try to static time the 
dual-vacuum carb on my bus it will be way retarded from where it should be.  No power, runs bad!

As a final check, put on a timing light and check the total advance.  It should be about 28 degrees (conservative).  Some folks put in 
more, but watch out for detonation.
