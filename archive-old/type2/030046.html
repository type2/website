&gt;    Gee, George, as a physiscist I know you understand all too well the
&gt; principles of intertia and momentum- would you actually let someone ride
&gt; on the ice chest?

As I wrote that, I knew that someone would call me on the safety aspect!

Life is full of tradeoffs, and risk tradeoff is a part of life.  If I
wanted maximum safety I'd be driving an ovloV, or perhaps locked in a
closet at home.

No, I wouldn't carry a passenger on the ice chest for any extended trip,
but for a short low speed trip it wouldn't be a problem.

Sometimes when I am travelling I visit friends, who like me have a couple
of children.  4+4=8.  If we're going somewhere where parking is a pain
(like a fair, for example) it is sometimes more practical to take one
vehicle than two.  This practice is not illegal in most states as long as
every available seatbelt is occupied.

I find it interesting how things have changed.  Not that long ago it was
common practice to load up the back of a pickup with adults and kids and
head for the beach/picnic/etc.  These days even the suggestion that
someone might ride inside the vehicle unbelted draws comment!
