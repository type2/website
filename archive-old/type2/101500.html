Subject: Re: [T2] Pertronix Catalog

&gt; &gt; Is it just me or is this link broken?  It did weird things three times
when
&gt; &gt; I tried...  Finally had to &quot;end task&quot; to get my system back.  Odd...
&gt;
&gt; I just pulled it down again.  Seems ok.

Thanks, it was my Acrobat, not the link.  All good now.
