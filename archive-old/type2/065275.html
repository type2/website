Subject: Sputnik has a success! (&amp; a coupla q's)

Well, finally I managed to actually complete some work on Sputnik (my '66
Westy) today.  It was kind of nice out and I figured that I should work on
the bus since it's starting to get cold here on Long Island.  My most
recent attempts to overhaul the brake system were constantly thwarted
by bad weather and other responsibilities and any other excuses I could
think up.  So I had to do the job bit by bit.  This entailed replacing the
brake shoes, master cylinder, brake hoses, and brake lines.  The system
was totally dry so today I bled all of the wheels and lo and
behold--PRESSURE!!  The pedal didn't sink all the way to the floor!  I got
the pedal up to a decent height and was very pleased to find that none of
the wheel cylinders had exploded, so I guess they're all in pretty good
shape.
        This bus has been off the road for 13 years so this is a pretty
big deal for it (and me).  Now I just have to get it started.  My problem
is that the starter isn't turning over.  Right now I'm trying to trace the
problem by elimating things one at a time so I have a couple of questions.

        1: Is there a way to test the starter out of the bus?  It's kind
of tight up there and I can't really see what's what once my hands are in
the way.

        2: I'm trying to get the red and green lights to go on with the
ignition switch (they're not now) and I found some loose ends (on wires).
With the help of some nice color wiring diagrams, (thanks Thom!) I'll be
tracing these, and I was wondering if there's an easy way to pop out the
speedometer to make things a lot easier.

This is on a totally stock (i.e. 6 volt) 1966 Westy and I'm preparing for
the 12v conversion with a 1600DP but I want to get it going as it sits
now and use it like this first.

Thanks in advance,
- -Erik.
