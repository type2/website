Subject: Re: Adventurewagen help needed

I believe that brochure is for a '72. That's when they started putting the
vinyl covering on the cupboard doors and if you look close you can tell
that it has the later taillights.

Here's a page I created for my '71.
http://home_dot_comcast_dot_net/~sonofed/71AW.htm

A friend of mine has an early '68 that I believe is an Adventurewagen but
it has a couple of minor differences from the other early AWs I've seen
plus it has a sticker claiming it to be from another vendor. In spite of
the sticker I think it is an AW and the sticker probably is for a sales
lot where the conversion was originally sold. I'll get some pictures up
soon.

Also, you should join the Adventurewagen Yahoo group at:

&gt;
&gt; Here is a brochure from 1971 and I am sure the '70 is similar:
&gt; http://www.baywindowbus_dot_com/adventurewagenbrochure.htm
&gt;
&gt; And another (not on my site):
&gt; http://home.earthlink_dot_net/7Eshrike3/adventurer.html
&gt;
&gt; There are some good photos on the bottom of my &quot;interior&quot; page too:
&gt; http://www.baywindowbus_dot_com/interiors.htm
&gt;
&gt; If you have any camper interior pics I haven't shown please send them to me!
&gt; I do have some SunDial camper photos not yet loaded to the site.
