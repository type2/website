Chad,

Call DB&amp;HVW at the number in the magazine. They can get you past copies
and/or reprints. I tried to get permission to post them on my web site
but couldn't get them to agree.

&gt;Second, I've been trying to get a copy of Dune buggies and Hot VW's
&gt;series called project westfalia.  Is spans approximatel 8-10 issues and
&gt;covers the restoration of a westy, including engine mods, suspension
&gt;mods, and general restoration tips.  They published it around 1989, and
&gt;I've seen it referenced on a web page.  Does anyone know what I'm
&gt;talking about, are you willing to share or sell?
