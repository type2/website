&gt; Would I be better off using these stock carbs or going for a Weber

My 78 Riviera came from the PO with the Weber Progressive replacing the
stock FI.  I have had zero problems with my set-up, but I was born under a
good sign ;-)  If I was building an engine, and bread was no object, I would
go with dual Webers.  Forget the Solexes.
