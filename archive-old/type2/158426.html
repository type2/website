Subject: Diagnoses help: Clutch won't release

Okay, I shoulda seen it coming. Going into reverse
there was a little bit of grinding... A month later,
maybe a bit more, then my cable broke enough that I
had to replace it there and then.

I had to tighten the cable to &quot;no slack&quot; before it
would release the clutch. I adjusted at lunch and
again on my way home. Once home, I stacked washers on
the bowden tube end to get more adjustment. I could
not get it to realease cleanly.

I pulled the engine and tranny together and they were
bolted up tight; that was one concern. The welds on
the release arm are intact; that was my other guess.
The diaphragm-type pressure plate was firmly attached
and shows no apparent problems. The disc looks just
like it did when I put it in 4 years ago - plenty of
meat left on it. No ugly hot spots anywhere, no bad
smells. Oh yes, the throwout bearing is rattly but
only very moderately so and definitely in servicable
condition - probably another 100,000 left on it!

What obvious thing am I missing? -BaH
