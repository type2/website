Subject: Westy part needed

Hello all, while sorting through and throwing out a bunch of stuff ( due in 
no small part to an impending divorce) I managed to toss the upper and lower 
mounts for my ' 78 westys table( the two brackets that the &quot;L&quot; shaped table 
support slides into) in the dumpster. If any of you have a spare set you're 
willing to part with, I'll be more than happy to give you a fair price and of 
course pay shipping. I don't need the carriage bolts or knob, but will take 
them if you've got 'em. Please p-mail if you can help.
Thanks, Robb
