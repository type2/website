&gt; &gt; &gt; Does any one know where I can get a pressure plate, clutch,

&gt; &gt; &gt; 210 MM.  This just seems a little expensive to me.

&gt; Maybe the difference is German parts compared other world parts. $200 for
&gt; German parts would be a much better value than $0.05 for the lesser spec
&gt; assemblies, in my adamant and arrogant (experienced) opinion. Just try not
&gt; to pay German prices for lesser parts. Make sure you compare apples to
&gt; apples and not turnips.

also though on the other side of the coin do you really need parts to
.0001 tolerances or will .001 work just as well, big difference in cost
