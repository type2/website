While traveling to the Maple Grove Show, last year in the 78 Westy, I
too experienced &quot;hesitation, bucking&quot; when full throttling on steep
uphills or even partial throttle on long slow hills..
Seemed OK at the show, but upon leaving, it severly was dying when you
gave it throttle to go.  First, checked the timing to make sure my plugs
were firing (strobe light) or points weren't closing up from a cracked
rubbing block (similar symptoms that happened before).....and that the
distributor was advancing (a stuck one is possible)....Then I got a
bucket, a pencil, and pulled the gas line to the fuel filter- voila, a
lot of brown came out, I let it run until clean, then plugged it.  Took
out the filter which seemed to be rather heavy from the rust silt
blocking it!  This was fine stuff,likely gets through any tank screen. 
Replaced the filter, has been fine ever since (I just pulled the engine
to replaced a failed clutch disk, and still seems to be flowing OK. 
Always carry a timing light and spare fuel filter... MB
