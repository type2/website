&gt; Hi everyone.  the wife has a 75 bus and I have a 67 bug.  I am thinking about 
&gt; a type 4 conversion for the bug and was wondering what the major difference 
&gt; is between the 914 engine and the bus engine?  Besides about thirty horses!  

the oil dipstick and fill is on the top not the rear of the engine.
