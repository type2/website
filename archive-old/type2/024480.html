Thanks for all the replies.  Looks like I need to order the one for
the alternator.  Unfortunately, Busdepot didn't have it in stock. 
They need an extra week to get it.  I was hoping to have the bus
fixed by next Wednesday.

A month ago I needed to replace the electric pump that the original
owner had installed.  I decided to go with the stock mechanical type
and used one that was in my parts box.  One of the list members
warned me that an old pump might start to leak gas into the engine
and sure enough he was right.  Fortunately, I haven't been driving
the bus due to all the road salt.  I've just been running it for 15
minutes every weekend to keep the battery charged.  I won't be doing
this anymore until I get the new pump and change the oil.
