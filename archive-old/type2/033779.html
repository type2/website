Subject: RE:  HELP!! can't get in or out of gear!

&gt;At traffic lights it is impossible to get the car into anygear at all 
&gt;apart from reverse which gives a horrible noise from the gearbox. 
&gt;After that it is then possible to get into all the gears again until 
&gt;the next stop at a traffic light.

I haven't seen this possibility mentioned, but the problem sounds very
similar to when my pilot bearing shredded in my 73 last year.  

The pilot bearing is a little roller bearing that is pressed into the end of
the crankshaft and the input shaft for the transmission rides inside it.  If
it goes bad and shreds as mine did, it will cause the input shaft to bind
against the crankshaft and act like the clutch is not disengaging all the
way.  If this is your problem, the fix is cheap, but you've got to pull the
engine to do it.
