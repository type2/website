Subject: What engine is this?
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

I'm new at this whole air-cooled bus stuff, but I feel I am learning fast,
thanks in part to all of your letters.  I need help though.  I recently
purchased a '73 Bus that had its engine replaced in the past.  Of course,
there is no data about where the engine came from or its specs.  The code on
it is CB047949.  It has a single Weber carb on it.  My guess its a 1700 but I
don't know if its a '72 or '73.  How can I tell and also can this be fairly
easily converted to a dual carb?

Another ? - according to the VIN, my bus is a Kombi, but everything I read
about them is that they should have two bench seats.  My bus has the table and
rear folding bed/seat with a top mounted rear &quot;cabinet&quot;.  It also has louvered
windows.  Is this a Kombi or did someone in the past try to make it a &quot;pseudo-
camper&quot;.

Thanks for all your great info.
