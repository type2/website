Sorry to say this, but it may be too late for these
kind of questions.  You really need to get all of the
money related questions worked out and on paper before
the work starts.

When I had my 65 DC painted (14 years ago, I think),
re-installing the glass was figured in from the start
in the quotation that I was given for the job, so the
hours that it took weren't a question--but the DC
glass wasn't hard to do either.
