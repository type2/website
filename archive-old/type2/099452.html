&gt;TRW? LOL.. Are they remanufacturing car parts again? Yeah! They do mainly
&gt;aerospace and defense contract stuff, but in hard times they have been known
&gt;to reman auto parts as a way of keeping their machines and machinists
&gt;working. YEARS ago I bought NEW rims for my '65 T2, and I couldn't find them
&gt;anywhere, but one local VW parts house carried some TRW reman'd rims and I
&gt;was able to get a new set.

Advance Auto carries (carried) alot of TRW stuff - mostly engine stuff and 
a few suspension parts.

TRW is a OEM supplier for several car manufacturers for different things. 
Locally they have a factory that assembles airbags for about 8 or 9 car 
manufacturers.
