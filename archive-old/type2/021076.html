&gt; Hm...  Just did a compression check on Sally.  I'd always THOUGHT she
&gt; was a stock 1776, even tho' she has NO oil filler neck coming thru the
&gt; tin and the dipstick in the regular bus position is cut off. The
&gt; functional  dipstick and filler (with the little box we know is the sign
&gt; of a porsche configuation that someone just found on the list) come off
&gt; the top of the engine.
&gt; 
&gt; Compression is 150 all around.
&gt; 
&gt; The only number I could find is CB043944, dual diaphragm vacuum dizzy,
&gt; weber 34 ict's, only the driver side carb is hooked up to vacuum, other
&gt; hose is plugged with screw.
&gt; 
&gt; Some more numbers from the little tower dude the oil filler box sits on
&gt; - VW EA 022-0100, more or less, in blue ink, seen from rear...
&gt; 
&gt; Any clues?
&gt;
