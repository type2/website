Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Free '74 Camper in Philadephia

-I spoke to Greg and I'm checking it out tomorrow-am only about 45 min
from there.  Don't really have the time for it, but will report on it.
I once parted a 74 Westy; put the rear bed into my 78, see

&gt; &gt; I have decided that I need to get rid of my camper, a white 74, that has
&gt; &gt; been sitting in my yard for two years now. 

&gt; In my opinion the blue &amp; green plaid which was only offered in the Yellow or
&gt; White Westy in '74 &amp; '75 is the nicest interior and layout offered in any
&gt; baywindow Westy.  Someone should jump on this if it is a candidate for
&gt; restoration.
