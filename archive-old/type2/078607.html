Downloaded the video off of Morpheus.
Too Kewel!

It shows a left side door Kombi, but the best shot was of the front of the 
bus where they had a rhino rack mounted to the front.

I have always wanted to mount one of these to the front of one of my buses 
just like some of these Gawd awful SUV things out there.

Has anybody ever mounted a front crash bar to the front of their bus?

I know it would serve little functionality, but I just think it would look 
cool.
