Subject: Re: [T2] horn sound

Some dood had those on his pickup in angels camp...  The highway was
across the creek, and it took me a few times hearing it to finally HEAR
it and say WTF???

It was very synchronous because we were turning a lawn tractor into a
li'l steam engine art car...

Oh, check it out, they've got &quot;smoke screen&quot; under accessories...
