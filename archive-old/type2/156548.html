Chris- I borrowed one of your photos and pasted it in
with photos of how it relates to what's above it. If
it had not broken off flush, you could have unscrewed
it with vicegrips. If you'll go to my albums, open the
third one and go to the last picture...

You'll see that there is a tubular member protruding
down from the oil pickup unit. The inside of that tube
is threaded. The stud that broke off is threaded into
it.

Where you are at now is needing to find someone who
has a bit more skill who is willing to drill that stud
and use an easy-out to remove it (while lying under
the car).

The replacement stud should be installed with LocTite
on the upper threads and allowed to cure before
installing the lower part. Don't over torque. Use a
little box-end wrench held in your fingers to tighten
it snug then a tad more. That's it. No need for a
massive torque wrench, but if you feel uneasy this
way, buy an inch-pounds torque wrench. -BaH
