just to make it a little easier pull the tranny out along with the motor,
its much more simple to get it back in that way.

&gt; I'll help on a Sunday, jack and tools provided, but I have never done a
type 4.
&gt;
&gt; We could do it at Troy's or Mad Uncle Dave's if the NC guys wanna do it,
or maybe at Boyd Smith's house if the TN Mechanized Unit wants to take it
on.
&gt;
&gt; Should be an easy 1 day job if Troy has all the CORRECT parts on hand.

One bit of advice. Have extra seals just in case one leaks on install or
gets buggered up. BTDT.
