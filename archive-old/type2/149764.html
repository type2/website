&gt; 2.  Also, why does my pressure gauge read higher
&gt; with SAE30 than 20W50?

It's made by VDO?

&gt; (I wouldn't put 10W30 in
&gt; my VW, but I'm sure someone else can tell us if
&gt; their pressure drops as I expect.)

I can't explain that. It's supposed to go up. From the Valvoline website:

&gt; SAE 30 is SAE 30 no matter what the &quot;W&quot; prefix number is: 0W, 5W or 10W. This
&gt; viscosity in centistokes (cSt) _at_ 100 degrees C is with the minimum of 9.3 cSt
&gt; and a maximum of 12.5 cSt.
&gt; 
&gt; SAE 50 is SAE 50 no matter what the &quot;W&quot; prefix number is: 5W, 10W, 15W or 25W.
&gt; The viscosity _at_ 100 degrees C is within the minimum of 16.3 cSt and a maximum
&gt; of 21.9 cSt.

Most of the 20w50's out there rate ~18 cSt _at_ 100C. Hence the 20w50 is much
thicker than the SAE30 at the same temperature the oil pressure should be
much higher.
