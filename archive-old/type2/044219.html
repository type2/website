mick1_at_onewest_dot_net sends:

&gt; The light would flash only when reaching a certain RPM. We towed it home and
&gt; today I did a compression test. 100 in cylinders 1,3,and 4 105 in cylinder 2.
&gt; Muir says that this light flashing at high idle means overhaul time but how
&gt; can I need an overhaul with Good compression in all cylinders.

Because compression is just one of the things that can indicate an overhaul.
Flickering oil light means worn-out main bearings.

You need to split your case, either have it align-bored on a Rottler boring
machine (accept no substitutes!) or buy a new one (preferable), have the
rods rebushed, have the crankshaft and camshaft reground and change all your
bearings, main, rod and cam. http://www.macsalon_dot_org/howtos/vwengine.html
will tell you what to get.

You can *theoretically* just change the piston rings when you do the
shortblock overhaul, but you're sitting at the lower end of good compression
so live it up and change the pistons &amp; cylinders too. I also recommend
having the valve seats reground and changing all eight valves, the valve
springs...
