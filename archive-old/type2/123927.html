Subject: Re: [T2] Let me introduce myself... :-)

&gt; First of all, I'm not really sure about some facts of my VW. The
 manufacturing year for example: In the registration card says it's a 1969
 model. I've been surfing in the web and I can't find exact data about buses
 built in that year. On the other hand, I don't have or know the exact model.
 On the registration card says &quot;1,600-221&quot; because it has a 1,600cc engine,
 but what does the &quot;221&quot; mean? I've been looking for this model in the web,
 and I didn't find any information. Anyway, I've posted some photos of my
 Kombi in my website at www.wolsoft_dot_com/mykombi/ so you can help me in
 recognizing the year and model. One thing I know for sure: It's air cooled
 and it doesn't have a split front window! ;-)

The 22917xxxx  vin number on your metal plate says it is a 1969 bus via the 3rd digit, the 9. 
The 22 says it is a Standard or Station Wagon 8-seater, 9-seater

Yours is modified into a semi camper.

It appears as though someone made a filler section to go in the walk-thru opening?
