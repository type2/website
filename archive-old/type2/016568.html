&gt;I think this was a '71 bus

Joe:

Richard Muller clearly stated &quot;My '78 2.0L fuel injected Bus&quot;.

There were two similar, but different, messages.  I was responding to
Richard's regarding his fuel injected '78.

There was a subsequent, similar message from Brian Newman, which
referred to his '71.  I did not reply to that one.

Let's not confuse people with our replies.
