Subject: Trade BA-6 switch for BA-4 unit

I've come across a nice BA-4 heater, so I'm pulling together some
install stuff.

I have two spare BA-6 heaters, and at least one of the timer switches
for the dash, but need the correct BA-4 dash switch.

Also need the exhaust and intake pipes, and the mounting bracket for
underneath the heater...

Would anyone like to trade anything??

Den.
