Subject: Re: [T2] 34pict3 on a single port

&gt; Will a 34pict3 carb bolt right onto a single port intake manifold?  I want
to
&gt; swap off the 30pict3 to see if that's my starting problem.
&gt; TIA!!

No, but there is a way to use that carb on a single port engine.

Just use a stock dual port center section with our special single port end
castings.  These are aluminum castings that fit a single port engine the way
dual port end castings fit a dual port engine.
