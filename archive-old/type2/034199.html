&gt;Is the Aux battery of any use during this process?

 It can be.  In my case, the primary starting battery is small, and a few
years old.  It starts great in the summer, and okay in the winter as long
as it's above freezing.  Below that, it sometimes hesitates before spinning
up.

If you wire your aux battery the way most people tell you to, it will not
be connected to the main battery or starter when the key is in the &quot;start&quot;
position - only when it is in the &quot;run&quot; position.  In other words it won't
be helping start the vehicle.

Recently my alternator went out and I wired the aux battery directly in
parallel with the main battery.  First so that they would both be used to
start the vehicle, and second to eliminate the 700ma drain from the
continuous duty solenoid while the engine is running.  I haven't gotten
around to unhooking the aux battery yet - there is really no reason to
until I go camping again.  In the meantime, I have noticed that the motor
cranks much faster on cold mornings.

So, if your starting battery is small, or old, you could gain a little by
hooking up your aux battery during starting.  Otherwise, it's probably not
worth the trouble.  Get yourself a new group 27 Interstate starting battery
and be happy.
