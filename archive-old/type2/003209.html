Sounds like what you want is something like what you've got.

A few weeks before setting off on your long trip, post the route, with a
heading say

&quot;BPRS Route Notice&quot;

I might say

 &quot;Englishman and family travelling from LA to Philly in 74 Westy,
July/August 2000.&quot;

Folks along the route who would be available/willing to lend a hand etc
would Pmail me with details, invites to cook outs, Weddings, Barmitzva's
etc.

I could reciprocate with offers to help lonely Americans and Canadians
&quot;Doing Scotland&quot; etc.

All free, all voluntary etc etc,.

Just a thought!
