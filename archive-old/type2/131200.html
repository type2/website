Subject: AIRS  -  Snoopy has been helped

I just got off of the phone with Snoopy


while there are no local TN loaner engines available,  Snoopy has been in 
constant contact with Herb and Elmer from the Scenic City Volks Club.

He is going to leave his bus at their house, get a rental car and drive to 
Charleston.  He has an extra T1 engine at home,  he will drive back to TN 
next weekend to install that engine and drive the single cab home

thanks to all who helped..........esp Herb and Elmer!

peas,
Buddah
