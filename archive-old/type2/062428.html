     Hi all,
     
     I went to VW Action this weekend. It was a little quieter than last 
     year, but it was cool. I love the facilities at the NAC.
     
     Anyway, met up with Sarah, and Clara and many many others. I got my 
     bus in the main display along with some other sambas including a 
     double door passenger samba.
     
     I picked up some extra cool wheels. They are like Porsche fuchs but 
     made for large stud pattern - i've seen them in VW Trends. I paid 50 
     quid each for them and they've hardly been used. 
     
     I'm sure that Sarah will have much more to say about action though,
     
     Lee.
