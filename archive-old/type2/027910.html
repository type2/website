Can anyone volunteer, or recommend, a VW shop (dealing with busses) where I 
can start repairing/restoring my vehicle ? I have tried to work with someone 
where it is stored to take the project, but have gotten NO takers. Current 
location south of New Orleans.

I will accept a private individual that is interested in making some money 
on the side and am in no hurry to have the work done, but have cash waiting 
to be spent on the vehicle. Just as long as it is done properly.

I am currently overseas, and will be returning soon, and would like to have 
my 71 Westy up and running when I get back. It needs allot of minor things, 
then the NEW engine and transmission installed, and then I will start (or 
have someone start) in on the body work and repainting.

If you are interested, send me an e-mail regarding questions and other data 
and I will get back in touch with you.

Michael
