Subject: Wiring diagram for FI 78 T2

Hello all,
	I am currently in the process of rewiring the front end of my 78 Bus.  If a
2.0FI and all the wiring is put back togeter except for the fuel injection
part of the fuse box.  I am new to wiring and cannot remember the name of
the small blocks that go on the fuse panel.  I think there is about 4 or 5
of them. I just can't find anything that shows me what order, and how, they
plug into the fuse box.  Can anyone help out?  Thanks


Troy
