&gt; Hi,
&gt; My wife Amy and I have been searching for a Westy
&gt; for awhile. We really
&gt; want something rust free.
&gt; Our luck really hasn't been good finding one so far.
&gt; We are located in
&gt; Mystic, CT. If anyone has any leads
&gt; or a pop top for sale please please please let us
&gt; know.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Bill &amp; Amy

   If you get to Virginia check out Mid-Atlantic VW
25mi south of Richmond. Almost always have 15-20 in
stock. Call 804-732-7327                              
   Good Luck  Wayne
