Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Valve Questions.............

Jeremy,

What Mark is saying is that the pushrod may have something in it that is 
blocking the delivery of oil to that particular rocker arm....oil is 
pumped up thru the pushrod into the rocker arm and then flows inside the 
rocker arm to lubricate the rocker arm metal to metal surfaces.

If the valve stem is &quot;stretching&quot; , I would expect the adjustment on that
valve to be very &quot;tight&quot; as compared to the intake.

Not sure if &quot;thread showing&quot; is going to be an accurate assesment or not.  
You will need to follow the instructions for valve adjustment and then
back off the adjustment till it gets &quot;loose&quot;....3 turns to get loose? or 
just 1 1/2....how many to get loose on the other valve?  Hard to tell 
about how many turns would be really bad across the net.

Cheers, dave

&gt; same cylinder?

&gt; There is a difference in the amount of thread showing  through the tightening 
&gt; nut on the exhaust valve vs. the intake valve.  I  can't remember which has 
&gt; more showing.  Will have to check when I get  home.  
  
 What would you consider a &quot;long way off of standard&quot;?
  
&gt; More when I get home and get under there.
