Subject: Fan shroud refurbishing (picture finially)

Hello list,

I wrote the list about a week ago saying that I have
restored my fan shroud. I cleaned it and bead blasted
it. I've finially got around to taking the picture.
Sorry to those who I promised a picture to earlier.
Here it is.

Have a nice day!
