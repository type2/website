Subject: Re: [T2] please id vehicle in back ground

Well it looks like a VW Type 2 to me :-) 

shape of air intakes is 72 on. No sliding door on the right and wardrobe at the rear right, so probably Right Hand drive. Shape of side windows indicates a modified panel van. style of roof is a straight up poptop of the style used by Devon (note twin vents in roof so definitely not a Dormobile), placement of the wardrobe in the rear right window would confirm a Devon conversion. 

So I-spy a late 70's RHD panel van converted to a camper by Devon. 

The style of houses, number plate on vehicle, and location (Kirktown in south Scotland) all shout UK, which would tend to confirm obersvations above. 

Good luck
