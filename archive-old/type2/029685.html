&gt; Factory procedure is threads clean and dry. If assembled per specs and used
&gt; as intended, it will not come off. Anti-seize is misused far more often
&gt; than most will accept, just like Loktite. I advise use neither in this
&gt; application. But as I said before, if that's not good enough for you, use
&gt; blue Loktite, and just two or three drops max. It will not be a problem for
&gt; removal if all else is stock. Now if you use something stronger, don't
&gt; bring it to my shop and expect a flat rate bill.

I'm probably one of the biggest abusers of anti-sieze around, since I want
to be sure that fasteners come out when I want them to.  I hate
broken studs and bolts and I'm willing to accept some premature
loosening to avoid expensive rework.

Oddly, I've not really experienced any additional loosening of fasteners
I've treated with anti-sieze.  It doesn't seem to make any difference in
maintaining fastener tightness in operation.

I won't use anti-sieze on wheel lugs, although I've never had one of these
sieze on me.  I wouldn't normally use it on a gland nut except in the
extreme case listed above.  For any application where the fastener might
be subject to corrosion, I use it liberally!  Removing the tin from an
engine is a pleasure when you know that all the screws will come out
without application of blue words!  Having the exhaust nuts come off
easily without stripping...  priceless.

&gt; A German gland nut can be reused, but only if you know for certain that it
&gt; has never been overtorqued. That is rarely the case, hence, only a new
&gt; gland nut can insure against failure.

I think that the gland nut is one of VW's less-than-perfect ideas.  It
obviously makes assembly faster in the factory, but even VW backed away
from it on the Type IV.
