Subject: Weird Engine Sound?

Hi,

I was driving around today in my bus and the engine started making a sound
that wasn't quite like its normal sound. It has a little clanking or 
tac-tac-tac-tac to it
that gets me uneasy, therefore I decided to record the sound and ask you 
guys if
you hear it too, {or if it just me getting paranoid : )}...

The sound bite is at  http://rpalomera.home_dot_comcast_dot_net/VW/
(or if you prefer http://rpalomera.home_dot_comcast_dot_net/VW/VW105.wav )

I was thinking of going to the CT meeting this weekend (about 150mi round 
trip), but I'm worried
that the sound is an indication of something that needs to be taken care of 
right away before
any trips. I just don't know what...

Thanks a lot for your kind help. Regards,

Rogelio
