&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; Need to replace my rear shoes on my '70 westy.  I can't find a 46 mm
&gt; anywhere.  Is there a standard size that will work?  Thanks

1 13/16 works perfectly.  Got mine at Sears along with a 3/4 drive T-handle.
Put a 5 ft. length of Radio Shack antenna mast on the end and use the
bathroom scale method of torque application.  Soooo much neater than the
hammer whacker method.
