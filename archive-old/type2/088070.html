Subject: RE:  Engine Temperatures

&gt;I have heard that Radio Shack just came out with such a unit

Here's the link. It's on sale now.

e=CTLG%5F008%5F007%5F000%5F000&amp;product%5Fid=910%2D5390

If it doesn't work, just do a search on their site for thermometers.

I would be interested to know where on the engine you took readings, and
what the readings were relative to ambient temps.
Thanks,
