Subject: Re: [T2] Luggage Rack

Hey

The luggage rack on the rear (63-73 Westy) is held on by 6 phillips head
screws. 3 (through rubber bushings) in the rear and 3 smaller ones towards
the front. They just go through holes in the sheet metal. They do collect
rust (I found on mine) but would have to be pretty rusted to move the rack.
For what its worth the pop top is held on by six screws on the front through
the hinges and these hinges have slots in them, so you can move the pop top
some after loosening the screws. How big is the gap?

The luggage bars are pop riveted on the fiberglass and can be drilled
through, removed and then you just use new pop rivets. You can get a pop
rivet tool and rivets for about 15 bucks.


Hope this helps,

Subject: [T2] Luggage Rack


&gt; Hi All,
&gt;
&gt; I am thinking of removing the rear luggage rack on my 70 westy. I need to
&gt; re-attach some of the metal bars and clean them up. I notice that the rear
&gt; of the pop top does not seem to come as far back onto the luggage rack as
it
&gt; seems it should. This may be why the rear latch, inside, does not really
&gt; hold the top tight. How is this luggage rack attached to the roof ? Is it
&gt; the obvious fasteners that I can see. Will there be any room for
adjustment
&gt; when I put it back on to get the two tops to line up better?
&gt;
&gt; Any and all help / opinions welcome.
&gt;
&gt; Jeff
&gt;
&gt; P.S. Had a great time at Busses by the Buoy. I may post a trip report
&gt; tomorrow.
