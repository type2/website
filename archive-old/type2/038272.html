&gt; I'm curious -

&gt; I have the table that hinges from the top on the
&gt; driver's side. I don't
&gt; believe I've ever noticed a method of securing the
&gt; bottom (during
&gt; transport), so that the table doesn't swing out
&gt; during those 1.5G left hand
&gt; turns.

Mine is held in place by the carpet (PO's doing, but I
like it), and it's good up to 4.3G's. After that, I
start getting a headache/nose-bleeds anyway.

&gt; 
&gt; What's that all about? Am I missing something really
&gt; obvious? Other than the
&gt; fact that I'm getting old and achy? Oh, and that my
&gt; nosehairs are starting
&gt; to tickle my upper lip?

Nose hair grows more quickly at high G-forces; unless,
of course, you have a pressure-suit. If you don't have
one, try the official USAF-issue
Submersible-CHemical-Nasal-Orrifice-Zapper
(S.C.H.N.O.Z.) tool...but at $489,653.25/ea., you
might just try a little 'Nair', or even some
'Easy-Off'. Both work fine, at a fraction of the cost.

Is it still April first???;-)
