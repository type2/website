I joined the bus list less than a year ago.  When I joined there were
these periodic postings from some guy wandering the country complaining
about being broke. He even had this &quot;pretentious&quot; title to his postings
about some search for the wind. His name is Charlie Ford. At the time I
was more focused on learning about how to get a 1965 Westy back on the
road after sitting for 25 years. After several months of listening and
learning about the hardware I read one of his postings all the way
through. I don't remember which one it was but it made me realize that
he was writing about some interesting subjects. Even more there was a
lot of feelings that he expressed that hit close to home. I went to
where the messages had been archived and read everyone of them. I really
enjoyed them and am greatful that he took the time and money to post
along the way.  I realized that &quot; The Search for the Beginning of Wind&quot;
was the kind of Oddessy many of us think about but few of us act on. You
could call it pretentious because Charlie assumed that we would be
interested in what he had to say and how his life was going. Of course
that could be said for any posting other than a pure mechanical question
and answer. Expressing our feelings of pride and frustrations towards
our vehicles comes natural to some. Others are more focused on&quot;just the
facts&quot;. As others have said, read what you want and discard the rest.
With the split I moved to the vintage bus list. There was a fundraiser
for Charlie a while back and I'm sorry to say I was unable to contribute
at the time. If He is still posting to the other group I'm sure there
are a number of people 'round here that would like to know how he is
doing and wish him much luck.

Frodo A 65 Westy brought back to life after 25+ years.
PS&gt; Is Das Bulli Haus still around? I thought I read a posting that
their phone had been disconnected.
