Subject: Re: [T2] Re:online title places

&gt;&gt;      Just curious if anyone of you has used one of these title places
&gt; to
&gt;&gt; title a bus where there wasn't a title available for it?  Thanks,

&gt; The most important step is to have a bill of sale. Any bill of sale.   These
&gt; processes run into trouble if the vehicle has a recent
&gt; registration, is stolen, etc.

I used Broadway Title in Birmingham, AL to get a title for my '74. It cost
$139 and was worth every penny. But Tennessee (where I live) has pretty strict
titling laws. The laws vary widely from state to state. In Georgia, on a
25-year-old vehicle, you just have to provide a Bill of Sale. On a newer
vehicle, you can post your own title bond for six months. There's also a
significant cutoff at 1974. It's MUCH easier to get a title for a '74 or older
vehicle.

In my case, Broadway is a used car dealer who registered the bus in Maine,
where title laws are VERY lax on '74 or older - and sent me a Bill of Sale
saying that they registed the bus in Maine and sold me the bus in Birmingham.
The folks at the DMV looked at me VERY funny when I brought it in, but after
reviewing the sections of the Maine vehicle titling laws that Broadway
provided with the registration, they capitulated and issued a title.

Definitely research your state's laws. I could have circumvented Broadway by
having the guy I bought my bus from (a Georgia resident) register the bus for
60 days. But he would have had to deal with paying for the registration, use
tax and inspections - more than the $139 I paid Broadway.
