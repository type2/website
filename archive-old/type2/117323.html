Subject: Re: [T2] Best Spark Plugs for my 76 2.0L FI 

OH COME ON.  the capacitance between the electrodes of a spark plug has NO
effect on the circuit performance AT ALL.  The circuit is totally
dominated by the inductance of the coil and the, essentially pure, but
definitely non-linear, RESISTANCE of the air gap.  Any microscopic
capacitance (do the math, it's essentially unmeasureable) between the
electrodes is far and away swamped by the, still small, parasitic
capacitance inherent in most coil windings.


With the Van de Graaf generator you are comparing apples and oranges.  
The VDG is extremely current limited after you discharge the STATIC
electricity built up on the sphere.  Ergo if you delay the onset of the
spark you get it all at once and a nicer spark.  Still doesnt hurt does
it.

  However the ignition coil has a great deal more energy, temporarily
stored from the battery via it's inductance, and is definitely not as
current limited while there remains a spark gap in the HT circuit.* Move
your forearm OR a straight pin near to the high tension and you get
essentially the same current.  Either way it knocks you on your ass.

Once the spark gets going and ionises the air, all the energy gets dumped
into the gap regardless of the shape of the electrodes.  Why the shape is
important is that it is desirable for the spark to get started every time
we want it, when we want it, under the less than optimal conditions of the
combustion chamber-heat, pressure and carbon on the electrodes. Helping it
is a good thing.

I doubt your classroom VDG will put out ANY significant spark at 135-180
psi (typical cylinder pressure at spark time), regardless whether you help
it with sharp points or your forearm.

* if the HT lead is shorted to ground then the resistance of the HT coil
becomes a significant part of the circuit.  This limits both the max
current output of the coil and additionally the build up and decay of the
magnetic field, which rate actually determines the HT voltage available,
via the primary due to increased inductance of the total system.

&gt; In class, I use a very fun machine called a Van der Graff generator.
&gt; It consists of a one-foot-diameter metal sphere that builds up a static
&gt; charge of 400,000 volts or so.  If I place my nice broad rounded forearm
&gt; near it I will receive a nice fat blue spark about 4 inches long.
&gt; However, if I point my finger at it, I will only get a weak spark about a
&gt; half-inch long.  If I use a straight pin, I can ground out the sphere
&gt; without drawing a visible spark at all!
&gt; 
&gt; How does this relate to spark plugs?  Well, the ignition system of a VW
&gt; was designed to work with the capacitance of the standard broad-tip plug.
&gt; If you use platinum narrow-tip plugs in this system, the spark will indeed
&gt; jump the gap easier.  However, the spark will jump the gap before the coil
&gt; builds up its highest voltage.  You will therefore get a weaker spark than
&gt; if you used the standard plug.
