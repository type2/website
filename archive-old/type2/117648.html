Subject: Spark Plug Shimming (Friday)

A few weeks ago, I realized that my #3 plug wasn't firing (via ye olde
&quot;pull off a plug wire and see if it runs the same&quot; test), so I pulled the
plug to do a compression test and found that the plug gap was off (the 
electrode was touching as if pushed in).

I'm not sure how that gap disappeared, although I'm fairly certain that it 
happened &quot;suddendly&quot; as I noticed the difference when it happend -- the 
difference between running on 3 and running on all 4.  I'm not terribly 
concerned though.

What is interesting is that I mentioned this to a friend and VW mechanic 
(for an air-cooled shop and a dealer) and he said if I see this problem 
again, I might try shimming my plug.

Furthermore, he mentioned that the next time I had the heads off, I should 
consider examining the plugs and trying to get them farther back into the 
combustion chamber, as this would result in better gas mileage and the 
fuel would burn more completely.

I have to admit, I find this a bit dubious and am immediately concerned 
about the affects of shimming on getting a solid seal on the spark plug, 
but I'm curious as to other folks' opinions/experience on this.

Cheers,
