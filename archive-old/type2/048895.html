Subject: [T2] BN4 Instuctions and Templates

I've sent a few Xeroxed copies of the BN4 Gas Heater installation
instructions and templates out but as I suspected, my bill at Kinko's is
getting larger. Since I can't scan, I hope to have one of these copies in
the hands of another list member who agreed to find a place on his web site
for the stuff. Hopefully when this happens he'll make the announcement to
everybody.
My two concerns are:
1) Since the templates are VERY size specific is it possible to  make a
downloaded version the right size?
2) My info is a Xeroxed copy of an original. If someone would scan an
original brochure the quality would be better.
