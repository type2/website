Subject: Re: Trailer hitch?

Well Jim, I have one and I'll be happy to measure it for you.  It
basically extends forward to the torsion housing where it attaches with
big U-bolts.  The hitch end attaches to the bumper with a &quot;hook&quot; formed
from plate.  Most of the hitch structure is formed from 3/4 square stock
which is welded to the &quot;tongue&quot;.

the bumper carries the vertical loads while the torsion housing carries
the horizontal and twisting loads.

It's sitting outside and it's dark and spooky out there.  Let me know if
you want more exact measurements!

George Lyle
