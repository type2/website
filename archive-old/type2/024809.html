&gt;  wouldn't need (hence the $19.95 price) but would work.

Speaking of side lights, I have been thinking for some time about installing 
the
rear light assemblies in the front reflector lenses and connecting them to 
the 
front signal lights on my 71 Westy.  This would help anyone that might be in 
my blind spot know that I want to make a lane change.  This is a real problem 
on the So. Calif. freeways.  Off course, the light would probably only be 
visible at night unless I used halogen bulbs.  I thought I could get away 
with the brighter (and hotter) halogen bulb if it is only blinking for a 
short duration.  Or I might just rig it to the running light system like in 
the rear (like the side lights on my '64 squareback).  Has anyone tried any 
of these ideas?
