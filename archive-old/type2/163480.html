Consider  a roof rack. 


Hey Guys  Problem with roof rack is gettint it up and down and you  have to 
real careful of drive thurs and such.  Had a friend who had his  bikes on top 
and was the first to get to the beach house and in his excitement  of being 
first was thinking only of his luck at getting to park under the  house,  so much 
for 2 bikes and racks :)   later  Mark  Dearing
