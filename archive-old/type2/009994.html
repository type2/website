Jarrett-

I'm along I35 in Irving, TX. You'll pass within 1 mile of my house when you 
go by the Cowboy's football stadium and Hwy183 just north of Dallas. You 
won't have been on the road long, but (817)930-9625 is my metro pager number 
if you need anything in my neck of the woods (between Waco and Oklahoma).

Have a blast on the roadtrip!

&gt;...if anyone has a driveway or
&gt;street curb they want to lend for a night, I'd love to hear from you.
&gt;....  Let me know if you're along the way, I'd
&gt;like to meet some of you.
