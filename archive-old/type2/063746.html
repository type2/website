&gt;Subject: CCC's 9/20-22 location?
&gt;
&gt;As many of you know, our Sept. campout promises to be a biggie.  Many
&gt;people have indicated serious interest, so it looks like there'll be
&gt;a good turn out.  Dave Schwarze and Joel Walker are coming from Texas
&gt;and Alabama repsectively.  If you can make only one camping trip this
&gt;year, this is definitely the one to put on your calender.
&gt;
&gt;Trying to narrow down a location:  some are coming from southern CA,
&gt;and some from northern CA, and of course Dave and Joel from the east.
&gt;We're trying to make this as &quot;east&quot; as possible (for D and J, who will
&gt;be driving in excess of 24 hours straight to be with us), but still
&gt;close enough to the LA and SF areas, so that as many people as possible
&gt;who've already indicated interest and have attended many times in
&gt;the past will still find it tempting enough to make the drive.
&gt;
&gt;Kathy Myers has suggested the Mammouth area, which is I think southeast
&gt;of Yosemite.  In winter this could be tricky to get to with closed
&gt;passes, but won't be a problem in September.  Kathy can probably
&gt;advise us on the approxomite driving times and best routes, etc.  Kath?
&gt;It's at relatively high elevation, so should be a nice escape from
&gt;the heat waves.  Temps in about a month are supposed to be 60-70sF
&gt;in the daytime, and 30-40s in the middle of the night.  Good climate
&gt;to test out that new camping heater you've just installed.
&gt;
&gt;At any rate, I move that we concentrate on this area.  Kathy has made
&gt;a few suggestions, including one place in the wilds which would be
&gt;free, and another group site (which is fortunately very reasonably
&gt;priced).  I've called the phone number she gave me and am awaiting
&gt;information on at least a few of these places.
&gt;
&gt;Do I hear any pros/cons regarding the location?  If we get a group
&gt;site, we'll need to get working on reservations, so I'd like to
&gt;decided on the location ASAP.  Yays?  Nays?  Lemme know.  The date
&gt;is firm:  Sept. 20-22.
&gt;
