Subject: Re: [T2] the search for heat ends now .. Espar Airtronic D2
  installation

&lt;&lt;This project is not for the faint of wallet by any means, but the
rewards are well worth the investment in my book.&gt;&gt; 

 It might very well be a worth while expedition into class 8 truck bone
yards for the monetary faint of heart.

As I mentioned these oil burner heater's
have been used for supplementary heat for many years---
Instead of running the engines, flip a switch and the driver has heat,
while he is off the clock and napping. 

I'll bet they can be had with all of the controls--(no tank) for less
than 2-300 dollars.

A lot of guys rummage around bone yards for their Bus parts---
Time to start wallowing through the big stuff for Espar diesel heater's.

They are out there waiting to be plucked.

It'd be well worth the time to locate one.
