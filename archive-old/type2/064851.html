Subject: Re: 12V ---&gt; 1.5V?

&gt; FWIW, 
&gt; You should try out a very good electronics store (aka NOT Radio Shack!). 
&gt; Ask for a voltage regulator that will step down 12 volts DC to 1.5 volts 
&gt; DC. I know 12v to 9v are available, etc. but 1.5 v is pretty small. The 
&gt; device you are looking for will have three little legs for soldering 
&gt; connected to an approximately 1cm square chip. Its backside will be metal 
&gt; so you can attach a heat sink to it. Just a thought...

Actually, RS should have adjustable regulators, and these go down real low,
but that range (1.5 to 3v) causes feedback in the standard part and they
get REAL hot even with small current draw.  The resistor suggestion is
a better bet, but the light will screw this up (sine the current draw will be
more with the light on, the voltage would drop).  With very small currents, 
using a bunch of silicon rectifier diodes (buy 'em by the bag at RS) in series
will work quite well also.  Each will drop about .75v, so a bunch are needed.
LED's drop more (2.2v?) and you can actually wire 5 in series without a
resistor on 12v (but they suffer badly during surges).  Something like 16
diodes in series, maybe, will give 1.5 volts remaining at 14v source, and
will probably not run the thermometer when your car's not running...

I have these in my Westy, but just use the little battery they come with.
I've thought about wiring in a AA cell, and never bother with it again, though.
Or wire the backlight on always, and use a dropping resistor.  Whatever you
do on 12v will waste energy, either heating up a resistor, heating up diodes
or heating up a regulator.  If it draws 1ma at 1.5 volts it will still draw 1ma
at 12v.
