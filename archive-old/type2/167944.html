Subject: Re: [T2] Very large oil leak help requested

hello ???    First you need to tell what year and type of  engine is your 
bus.   Sounds like a type 4 motor. which was from 72 to  83  These have a oil 
switch on top of the oil cooler behind the dizzy.  Check it first.  Last thing 
sign your name and location,  somebody  might be in your area that would be 
willing to help you if they knew who and  where you are  later  mark dearing
