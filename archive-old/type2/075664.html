Subject: RE: [T2] RE: Windshield

I haven't checked in the Bus but in my Ghia there are also drain holes in
the bottom of the body where the inner and outer rockers seam together.  I
would want to make sure that where I drill the holes leads into a body
cavity between panels and not into the interior of the Bus.  Then follow the
body cavity down to the bottom and ensure that there are holes there to let
the water out.  Dirt particles large enough to clog the holes should never
be getting between the windshield rubber and the frame.

&gt; 
&gt; Where would said hole drain to and what happens when they get clogged with
&gt; dirt?
