Subject: FW: [T2] Replacing windshield seal

I bought a $69 new windsheild from Safelite. They added $30 for
installation.  The second and third attempt to install it were free :) They
used a black urathane sealant. Windsheid does NOT leak now. We had to beat
the crap out of the windsheild  to get it in.  I provided a WCM seal for the
install. The seal is a little thin in the corners and exsposes some virgin
headliner. 

18 months later leak free and happy.
