Hi William,(and List),
	Was your engine a FI'ed/catalyzed and Elec.Ignited turnkey?  Are
these legally(or shade-ily) available for non-emission accountable vehicles
in California yet?  Mexi-beetle and/or some other importer will sell you a
complete vehicle with one in them, but I have yet to hear about anyone being
able to purchase just the engine alone.  Does anyone have any info on the
availability, and/or reliability of these hydraulic replacements?  I would
be interested in popping one into my '70 for the interim, until I can swap
in a Type 4.  Thanks!

	Eron
	


Hi, Steve--

I triggered a thread about engine break-in on the list when I got my new VW 
de Mexico engine the first week of July 1999; the type2 archives should have

it. Listees contributed a lot of useful data and lore.

To the braintrust as a whole, I have a question I was wondering about: What 
differences, if any, between breaking in a [full] rebuild and breaking in a 
new engine?

thanks
