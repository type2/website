Subject: [T2] fuel injector questions

Anybody know what the voltage is to fire a fuel injector?

My injectors on my '79 FI bus won't spray (I've taken them out and visually
verified this).  I register _at_150mV across the wire connector when I am
cranking the engine.

Could this indicate my ECU is defective?  What's the possibility of plugged
injectors (car sat for 6-7 yrs)?

Thanks - Mike
