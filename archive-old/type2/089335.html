Subject: timing the 009 question

hi everyone,

Quick question:
I just bought a timing light for the first time in all 10 years of air =
cool-ed-ness.
Previously I've statically  timed my engines with no real problems.=20
But, all of the &quot;009's are crap&quot; discussions has gotten me sufficiently =
worried.
From T2 library article
 http://www.type2_dot_com/library/electrip/bosch009.htm &quot;Timing the Bosch =
009&quot; by Ken Hooper, he says &quot;you have to rev it until the distributor =
stops advancing before you dial it in&quot;.
I don't have a tach.
So... I guess what I want to know is;  is there a govenor on the =
distributor?  Can I over rev the engine and do damage? Any suggestions =
would be appreciated.

thanks Dave
