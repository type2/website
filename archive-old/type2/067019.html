That's what I would have thought had we not owned the bus since it 
was new.

I find it difficult to believe that the dealer would go to all 
that time and expense to hide a master key for his customers.  The 
key and metal tag with the key code stamped into it were hidden 
above the heater hose, attached to the bus with one of the 
original heater hose tie-downs.  Hiding it like this would have 
taken at least 30 minutes of a dealership mechanic's time.  It 
would have been much easier for the dealer to keep each master key 
in the respective customer's file folder.  So, I'm guessing that 
hiding the key under the car was standard practice, at least for a 
while, at VW of Germany.  I *could* be wrong about that (it would 
be the first time in my life, though). (;-)

At any rate, I'd like to see the results of the great hidden key 
search.
