Subject: Re: Looking for a split in Tennessee

&gt;I have been looking for a split window bus here in East Tennessee - not 
&gt;much to choose from.  I would appreciate your thoughts on specific 
&gt;years to avoid and why.

64-67's tend to be the easiest to find parts for other than a few 
oddball 1 year only electrical components.  The simpler the model, 
the easier to restore (less parts to find).  I would say go ahead 
&amp; get whatever you LIKE.  I personally prefer 1961 and earlier 
models for purely aesthetic reasons (small rear window, bullet front 
turn indicators and small round taillights).

I ended up with the '64 21-Window after giving up on finding a nice 
23-Window (had been looking for a couple of years).  I had aquired 
3 sunroof buses ('63,'64,&amp;'65) and the '64 ended up being the best 
prospect.

&gt;I have been unsuccessful in &quot;prying loose&quot; a local '65 Standard (I 
&gt;think!) - owner wants his son to fix it up, son is noncommittal, 
&gt;yada yada yada...kind of rust underneath but runs and has a single 
&gt;port installed.

That would be a good one to get aquainted to buses with.  As far as 
drive-ability, my favorite was my '66 Deluxe hardtop.  Great sight 
lines all around the bus.  Campers are somewhat difficult to see out 
of with all the cabinets.

&gt;I have restored two '66 bugs - I am a stock fan -  and am looking for a 
&gt;clean split project - the more glass the better - any suggestions?

I would say find one you like with as much rust as you are 
comfortable with and just go for it.  I have owned many and have 
become attached to a few.  I won't sell my '59 Single Cab because I 
have developed a &quot;working relationship&quot; with it.  I know what I can 
expect of it and it knows what to expect of me.  I won't sell the 
'60 Double Door Standard because: #1, it is fairly unique; &amp; #2, I 
paid way too much money for it.  I won't sell my '60 Westfalia 
because the '59-61 Westys were by far the classiest campers ever 
produced.  The rest I drive &amp; would part with if an offer came along.

So don't think you have to find the perfect one to start with.  Find 
one you like and have fun with it &amp; learn from it.  Keep your eyes 
&amp; ears open and when you find the &quot;keeper&quot; you will know it.
