Subject: Re: [T2] Rod bearing play

Crankshaft journal / connecting rod
Radial play (new) 0.02-0.07 mm, wear limit 0.15mm
Axial play  (new)  0.10-0.40mm, wear limit 0.70mm
.
There is no good place for an 1/8&quot; (2-3mm) of play in the rods.
Remove the rod and see if there even is a bearing there :)

&gt; Right after I hit send the word &quot;wobble&quot; occurred to me. That is what 
&gt; is happening, the piston and rod wobble slightly on the crank in the 
&gt; forward/aft axis. Only about 2-3 mm, but I wouldn't think even that 
&gt; much would be acceptable.

&gt; To rephrase: With the crank end of the rod held in one place the piston 
&gt; end of the rod can be moved fore and aft about 2-3mm. The axis of 
&gt; rotation is centered on the crank bearing. It's a very slight rotation 
&gt; but I wouldn't normally expect any in this particular location. OTOH, 
&gt; I'm not an engine builder so I thought I'd bring it to the list.
&gt; 
&gt; Lateral movement of the rod along the crank is NOT what I am talking 
&gt; about. It does that too, but it doesn't concern me as much right now.
&gt; 
&gt; Does that help?
