Your Weber parts guy is right...
These boots are the same as used on a Standard 1600 dual port from a Beetle...
they fit from the center section to each end casting.   just buy 4 instead of
the two required for the bug...

Mine lasted twice as long as the boots that came with the Weber kit...

&gt; Having trouble finding the 4 boots that hang a Weber progressive onto the

&gt; 3/4&quot; to 1 3/8&quot; and are made of rubber or neophrene or (technical alert) that
&gt; other stuff..aged brain fails me this time of night. Weber dealer on web
&gt; says they're called &quot;dual port manifold boots&quot;. Anyway._dot_can't seem to get up
&gt; on Bus Depot catalogue tonight.
&gt;
&gt; Any ideas for a source?

&gt; Formerly sweet running engine went caplooie this weekend, due to sudden
&gt; failure...you can almost see through the &quot;rubber&quot;..of 2 of these boots,
&gt; leaning out the mixture greatly. If you have them, might want to check for
&gt; beginning signs of failure..which I obviously missed :(
