Subject: Re: [T2] vacuum booster check vavle ?

On my sons jetta the valve leaked like yours.  i got a new one and it

&gt; Hello all,
&gt;     In the quest to solve my rough idle, short of putting a rivet in the
&gt; throttle plate on my 34pict, I was looking at the vacuum booster check
&gt; valve. My wifes 96 Jetta the manual says the check valve should be only 
&gt; one
&gt; way. (makes sense to me) On my bus I can blow through both ways with 
&gt; one way
&gt; a little more restrictive. Does any one recall these little animals?? 
&gt; Should
&gt; I just replace the thing??
&gt;
&gt; Thanks again list members,
