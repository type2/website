Subject: Need source for Raceware head studs?
Mime-Version: 1.0

Well I'm wondering if anyone has a better source (pricewise) distributor
than Raceware directly.  Their 914 kit goes $220 and $30 each for
inserts, ooof.

Otherwise wondering if anyone has ever tried what I understand is FAT's
solution, 8mm cromoly Bugpack T1 studs and 8x12mm timeserts.  As
I've never been much of a T1 guy, and tossed my last 2 T1 cases when
I last moved I don't even know which way this works, if I need a SP kit in
8mm or what, the long stud sets certainly won't be right.  This solution is
appealing in that the Bugpack kit is $65 or so and the inserts only $10, I'd
be interested in anyones opinion of the quality of the Bugpack set, and
whether or not they've used them on a STREET engine for say 50k miles
or more without leakage, basically how well their expansion rates fit the
air cooled engine.

Dolan and I pondered it for a bit and admittedly using them on a T4 if the
length is right is not worse than on a similarly sized T1, no inherent
difference, in fact my final CR is going to be a lot lower than a lot of crazy
big T1's I've seen so clamping force should not be an issue, longetivity is
my primary concern.

This is for the big T4 project, 78.4x95.6mm but to be honest out of 6 core
cases I have I don't have a set of origional studs that I'd care to use
period,
as I've used the best in the last 2 motors I've put together.  This is a
problem beginning to come to a head on twice built T4's or even on
origionals from salt laden areas like mine.

Anyway any experience with either solution is appreciated.
