I have replaced shift coupler, and front shift bushing, both were shot.  =
In the Bentley, It talks of making the adjustment when the car is in =
second gear to the floor shifter bolts, however, i cannot get it into =
second gear! =20

I can get reverse, 1st, 3rd and 4th ok, but second just does not want to =
engage, i do not hear it grind or anything, it is like there is no gear =
there.  What gives? =20
