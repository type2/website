Volk,

Um, I hate to shut down a thread that is so productive, but I think we
have about sucked all the juice out of this lemon :-)  I have my opinions
on the value of vacuum advance v. mechanical advance Dists, so does
everyone.  The problem is that by times it veers away from the mechanical
and towards &quot;ad hominem&quot; (ask me if you don't know what it means :) and I
hate that.

Personally I like Jaime characterization, it a FART (Frequently-
Annoyingly-Recurring-Thread)
