&gt; whats everyones opinion on J-tubes?  How exactly do they function etc?

I have em on my 78 2L automatic.  

I have an aux heater and the heating system was so far gone I just canned
the whole thing.  J-tubes are not avaliable comercially for the 2L so I
made some up.  I can detect no difference in any performance or operating
characteristic, the main reason for them is 
. Less weight on the rear end
. More room to work around the engine
. and the old heater boxes were in such lousy shape they were ready to
fall off anyway.

the only thing is without the heater boxes there is really no easy way to
hang that piece of tin that covers the pushrod tubes, nor would it work
anyway because the exhaust would be inside and the side would be open. so
I have left my thermostat disconected because I was not sure it would heat
up enough to cause the cooling flaps to open correctly.

some day I will fabricate a pushrod tube cover that is above the exhaust
pipes and then test out the thermostat's operation

this is for a 2L engine, stock set up, have no information on other
engines
as always  YMMV
