Hey, you've started a riot !!

If by any chance you  ( or anyone reading this on the list) can come up
with a MAC version of a VW screensaver, you can name your price  ( hey,
it's still Friday.... humor me!!)

I'll pay in cottage brew, coffee, or whatever your poison -- provided you
come up here to Canada and claim your pay!

Anyone heard of any After Dark modules with flying buses, or........ ?
