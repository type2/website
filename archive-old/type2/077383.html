Subject: Re: [T2] New Seats (was '69 sunroof project)


&gt;and maybe (is this a crazy idea?) heated seats swapped out of a junked
&gt;Audi 5000 or some such car since I'll be moving to Montana in two years.

This is a idea I like... can anybody on the list point me at car seats that 
will go into a stock '72 bus? Or will I have to do some welding and so forth 
to get something in?
