&gt;Well I think the bell-housing is cracked...

&gt;anyone have a tranny for my year (1972) lying around that they can sacrifice
&gt;for a fair price?  I'll glady pay any shipping to california.

Why not just replace the bellhousing?

&gt;P.S. What years trannys will work in this application?

72-75 will bolt up, but of those only 72-73 have the same ratios.  Make 
sure it says &quot;002&quot; on the side and not &quot;091&quot; and that it has the bolt holes 
in the top of the bellhousing where it hangs from the chassis.
