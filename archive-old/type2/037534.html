 Any door from a'68 to '76 should fit as the hinges were the same,although 
 the '74-'76 door has a black locking button on the window sill instead of 
 the older style latch that was located with the door opening lever.
 So preferably you want to find a '68-'73 door to properly match up.
 From '77 on the hinge changed significantly and whilst the door was
 unaltered,the new hinge is completely incompatable with the mounting
 thingies on the A pillar of a pre-'77 bus/van.
