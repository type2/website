Subject: 70 Westy FS in SW Ohio

Hey All,
An aquaintance of mine is selling his 70 Westy in Wilmington, Ohio (about 40 miles north of Cincinnati).  I've seen the bus and would say that it is a decent deal for the 2K he's asking.
Anyway, contact him, not me, etc. etc. etc.  Here's the info:

1970 Westfalia camper pop top. Runs great. Lowered. New brakes. New exhaust. Includes BN4 gas heater(not installed but works) Needs rockers and canvas replaced. All new tie rods and alignment. Missing icebox unit but working on getting one shipped in. Great bus just ready for next project  Email Jason at kstoops_at_aol_dot_com

Peace Y'all



Peace, John Baker

headed on to the police officer's station...&quot;
