Hi,
I had a '71 Bus and had to replace the brake light switch on the M/C.
After removing the old one, I had an assistant gently apply pressure to
the brake pedal just enough to keep fluid seeping out the fitting as I
tightened it up. I know it's cheating, but I didn't have to bleed the
system!

p.s. as for the &quot;Employment Question&quot;, I'm a Photographer.
