Hey Y'all,
  I am thinking about parting out my 73 Bus and was wanting to know if
the Exhaust(complete system) could be installed on my 77. The 72-74
ehaust seems to be a better system and easier to get good quality
replacements for. The one I have is perfect and made in W Germany. 
   The other Question is will the AFC's from a 411 or 412 fit or work
in a Bus? What years? Or just the printed circut?
BTW the Bus I am parting is a 73 Auto in Tacoma Wa area.
