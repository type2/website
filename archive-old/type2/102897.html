Subject: Re: [T2] service intervals

What the manual states isn't really true for our 30 year old busses.  I like
to grease the CV's every summer before the camping/traveling season and the
wheel bearings both front and rear everyother year.

With the bearings getting old, they seem to need grease more often.  I have
greased rear wheel bearings with only 15,000 between packing and have
noticed the grease was really getting bad.

I'd rather over grease than under grease, I've heard too many &quot;beside the
road&quot; stories when it comes to wheel bearings and CV's.

&gt; What's the recommended service internal for repacking the front and rear wheel
&gt; bearings for 73-79?
&gt; 
&gt; What's the standard service interval of CV joints?
