Subject: Re: [T2] Weird turn signal saga continued...1970

in my '78 I had a wired turn signal thing going on where my signals would
sparaticly turn on for no reason then if I would turn them on, left or
right, I would get nothing then sometimes it would work fine for a week or
so.....
replaced the relay and found out the old relay was full of water, go
figure......
now she's runin like a spotted ape (real good)

&gt; My '70 is inconsistent.  It does this, but sometimes works to the right,
&gt; sometimes to the left.  Can't seem to find a set of circumstance that
affect
&gt; it either.
&gt;
&gt; Weird.

&gt; Volks,
&gt;
&gt; Today I swapped turn signal switches, put in the correct fuse box, and
guess
&gt; what..................My signals flash in the instrument cluster when i
turn
&gt; them to the right(up) but flash once and no more on the dash when I go
left
&gt; (down) ..............I have a good relay, for it works fine internally and
&gt; externally when going to the right or on the emergency
&gt; lights....................
&gt;
&gt; Any one seen this before?
