&gt; 2nd time to post about this, sometimes is hard to avoid grinding when

&gt; Adjusted clutch, seems to be correct adjustment.  I can avoid the grinding 
&gt; by shifting into nuetral, giving it some good gas, then giving it gas as i 
&gt; ease it into 2nd.

syncronizer dying, ?

&gt; Why does this help?

it's called &quot;double clutching&quot; and it is the standard way of shifting on
gearboxes that are not syncronized or by many to put less load on the
tranny

&gt; What else can I do?

get good at double clutching and look for a good tranny?

might be adjustment but you said you played with that

take all of what I said with care I have only had automatics in the past
ten years and knowledge is rusty on manuals
