Subject: 1978  2.0L FI Riviera Engine/Tranny teardown

In mid-Oct I am going to park the bus and drop the engine/tranny on a 1978
2.0L Fuel Injected VW (Rivera model).  
I bought it in Jan 05 from the 2nd owner who in Oct of O4 had 2 heads
replaced and basic work done on it.
Main goal is: Make this bus as solid as possible and only do light/normal
maintence for the next 5 years.

My goals are:
Replace what needs to be replaced, and be proactive about replacing stuff
that is on the fringe. ( I know when you replace one hose you should do the
same to all.  So I am looking to do that as well.)

Get a firm understanding of my engine/tranny and guts. 

Wire in VDO Gages/Inverter/2nd Battery.  (I am going to go for the Dakota
Digital gauge one that is 3 in 1)  Also going to put in solar panel on top
so I can recharge as needed.  This will also allow me to jump my fellow bus
pilots as needed!  

 
One buddy who is going to help suggested replacing/updating these:

Belt                    Fuel Pump? Fuel Filter
Oil                      Exhaust gaskets, Intake manifold gaskets, Orange
RTV Silicon
Oil Filter (external or within sump?)
New Plugs
New Wires?
Rotor/Distributor Cap/ Valve Cover Gaskets
Points if you don't have electronic ignition, or just buy electronic
ignition...it is much better 
Since you have fuel injection, I am not sure what can be replaced, cleaned
etc.

What else would you recommend?
 
Background:
I am not a mechanic, my friends who are helping have done stuff like this
before and will be there to help me, along with some tools too.
The bus does not need this, it's a learning experience and major proactive
maintence.
Reading though various books (muir, Bentley and Rebuilding your air-cooled
engine) reading though ratwell_dot_com. Along many other books/websites.

You can check out the bus photos _at_   &lt;http://www.hueymungus_dot_com/VW&gt;
www.hueymungus_dot_com/VW
I will be posting photos and events of the teardown.
Once done I will be re-painting and putting in new rubber.  There is not
much rust, but what there is, is very manageable.
