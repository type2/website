Subject: Re: [T2] mysterious rattle

&gt; damn! i think my problem is more severe than i thought. the metal the
&gt; bolt goes through is no longer an enclosed circle, if it ever was (if
&gt; not, someone please tell me). the top of the circle is missing and there
&gt; appears to be a ring of metal around the bolt, as if the metal the bolt goes
through had broken.

Are you talking about the metal sleeve that should be in the rubber grommet of
the shock? This piece usually rusts to the bolt and then pulls out of the
rubber. New shocks come with the sleeve bonded to the rubber. You would need
to remove the old sleeve from the bolt.

&gt; i felt behind that wall and i can feel the back
&gt; end of the bolt, so i dont THINK tightening down the bolt will do
&gt; anything at all. i need to jack it up and remove the wheel to inspect it
&gt; better, but from what i could see, it looks like i will have to have
&gt; someone weld it for me.

The nut for the upper bolt is a captured nut and is in the gas tank area. You
would need to remove the gas tank panel to get to it. The bolt goes thru the
frame.


&gt; again, how bad/dangerous is it to drive with the shock not bolted at the
top?

Remove the shock completely. Drive without it until you figure out a way to
fix it.
