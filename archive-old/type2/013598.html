The little copper washers for the 10mn mounting bolts go under the bolt
heads.
The big red step seals go between the case and the cooler.
I don't think you use spring washers with the copper washers, I never
have.
I'm discussing a 2000cc Aircooled Type IV, 80-83

I can only assume that I'm correct in saying this since my cooler has
never leaked and the little copper washers aren't included in the
standard bebuild gasket set.

They leave out a few other choice items too! About $25.00 worth of
left-outs.

&gt; When installing the oil cooler on a 2.0 liter engine, where do the
&gt; 'thickish' washers go? Under the nuts ... or between the cooler and 
&gt; the crankcase?
