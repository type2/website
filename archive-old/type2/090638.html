Subject: (ok, it is ALMOST friday...) car show

HOLY COW! did anyone else see the car show on ESPN2 tonight? (9ish PM
CST)
there was this army SUV and they made a video to promote it. it had
electrified door handles, pepper spray squirters above the doors and all
kinds of &quot;james bond&quot; sort of features. damn, i didnt catch the name of
it, but i DID catch the yellow bay window camper in the background on the
video!!!! this thing shot some small missiles or something, in the
direction of the bus, at one point... i thought it was going to blow up
the bus! aparently, i was so focussed on looking at the bus that i didnt
notice the military jeep in front of it. whew! i was about to scream!
&quot;what did that bus ever do to you???&quot;

ok, just thought that was neat... what weird concoctions auto
manufacturers are coming up with these days! EEK!

waving to all,
