Subject: Re: [T2] headrests


I would probably guess that someone recovered 73+ seats and put them in a 72.
I seriously doubt VW would have done that.

&gt; &gt; Steve, you should add the word 'bay' in that sentence:
&gt; &gt; &quot;let me add that all the headrests fit all the seats&quot;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Vanagon headrests have thinner posts. Lately there are a lot of posts
about
&gt; &gt; people putting Vanagon seats in late bays.
&gt;
&gt; Whoops!  right you are!!  Vanagon ^= Bay!!!!
&gt;
&gt; Any idea on the '72 with headrest mounts in the seat frames?  Were
&gt; headrests a rare option in '72 or did I get a bus with mismatched seats?
