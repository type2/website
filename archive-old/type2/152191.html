&gt; Hey there all,
&gt; The parts bus is gone (woo hoo), so know I have to go someplace else for my
&gt; parts..
&gt;
&gt; Therefore, does anyone have a 78 Bay windshield?  Or know where I can get
&gt; one?

well on my way back from picking up the tranny from your bus I drove past
the Crazy Rays on Erdman ave (Baltimore MD, USA) and there was litterally
a &quot;Stack&quot; of buses,.  looks like at least seven maybe more and the one on
top was a late bay Westy. since the rear was facing the street I didn't
see the windshield.  all of the buses there looked like either bays or
vanagons...
