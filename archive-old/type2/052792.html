Subject: [T2] Delortto 40's for sale

Hi All,

I have a pair of Delorrto 40s for sale, fresh off my 1.8 type 4 that is now
sporting a Miller CIS injection system.

The setup is complete with intakes, linkage, air cleaners and the must have
Delortto carb manual.

I am asking $450.00 obo for all.

Any interested parties drop me an Email and lets talk!
