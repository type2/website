Subject: Re: Tranny bushings, linkages, adjustments?

Billy,

The rear rod goes thru a &quot;tunnel&quot;(a pipe).  The 2 bellows are on each end 
of the pipe and seal the tunnel from the elements while the rod goes in at 
the front and out in the rear.

This tunnel/pipe is what the bushings ride inside of to help keep the 
rod centered in the tunnel.

Front and rear couple together in the front and then the rear goes 
straight thru to the rear tranny coupler.

If you are careful when you pull the rear shift rod out, you can probably 
save the bushings for inspection....and *then* decide whether to replace 
them or not....

Cheers, dave

&gt; since I've got your attention, I've been rereading this post of yours the last few days, having bought the bushings and done the front of my 76 already...

&gt; There is a small round &quot;ring&quot; looking bushing at the front of the front rod.
&gt; 
&gt; --right, the front shift rod goes thru it (on later models only)
&gt; 
&gt; Next should be a rubber bellows that goes around the tube that the 
&gt; rear rod is supported in by the 3(yes 3!) plastic bushings inside the tube that support the rear rod.
&gt; 
&gt; --where is this bellows (mine is missing) in relation to the midpoint screw coupler? 
Also, the rear rod is a 'rod in a rod'? 
I thought the front and rear coupled together and went straight to the tranny?
