Subject: intro (Brief), and question on gauges

Hi everyone:
     First time poster and definate newbie to VW's. Purchased my 1979 Mexico
Beige Westie about 8 months ago and my life has changed forever. I literally had
never popped the hood on any car let alone a Type 2.  Before purchasing the
vehicle I got Muir's book and did some reading on what to look for. I didn't do
a compression test or anything but I did have my wits about me enough to notice
the oil pressure light wasn't working. I bought it anyway. It didn't matter,I
WANTED it. The PO had some substantial proof that :
          a) I was to be the third owner.
          b) That there was only 63,000 km on the original engine.

     I fixed the oil pressure light by putting in an new oil pressor sensor and
gave a big sigh of relief.  It took me six hours, and a brief attempt to remove
the engine tin (before I figured out that they make deep bore sockets). I was
soooo proud when that light came on. Now I can do my own tune-up stuff and I am
currently becoming familiar with AFC Fuel Injection. I had to replace the Air
Flow Meter this spring . Keeping in mind that &quot;Knowledge is powerful, but a
little knowledge is dangerous&quot; I got that Bently manual on order. Muir's book
was an excellent intro but I need something more specific for what I have.

Thanks for bearing with that. It was completely unavoidable. :)

I have a spare place for a gauge (where the clock would usually go), and was
wondering what is suggested? I am thinking Oil Temp VDO gauge. It would be nice
to have an oil pressor gauge as well. I figure that when that oil light comes on
it might be a little late. Do they make a combo gauge? Any help is greatly
appreciated.
