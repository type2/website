Subject: Jump starting a FI bus

I know this is a dumb question, but an
acquantenance said that some one once jump started
his '78 bus and fried the '78s alternator.

He said &quot;of course you never jump start a fuel
injected bus!!'

I said 'duh'¿¿

Question:  Will a jump start on a FI bus fry the
alternator to the point where the alternator needs
replacement?
