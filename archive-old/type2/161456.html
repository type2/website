Hi Cliff,

We burned half a case at Buses Of The Corn 2003:

Once was enough for that stunt. It killed the grass about 4' outwards  
around the fire pit and I don't want to think about how toxic the  
smoke was. Once you light the fuse on one of those there's no way to  
extinguish it and it's bright enough to be a &quot;hazard to navigation&quot;  
as BOTC is within a mile or two of a regional airport. There's also a  
prohibition against fireworks at our campground and I don't want any  
hassles with &quot;The Man&quot; at BOTC.


Happy trails,

&gt;  Most everyone had bugs and VW Busses with them.  I
&gt; went in my ASI/Riviera (T2).  Anyway, on Saturday
&gt; night, they burned an old 1600 bug-style engine block.
&gt;  Wow!  That was bright.  My `78 2.0 Litre motor was
&gt; said to be Aluminum.  Is it in reality a magnesium
&gt; alloy like the bug motor instead?
