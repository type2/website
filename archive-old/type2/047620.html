Hi Clara,

I'm a different Mike, Mike D..

I agree with you.  I like the simplicity of the early type IIs.  The Vanagans and
newer just have more complicated parts to breakdown.  I bought my 74 Westy for
$500 with a bad engine.  By the time I replaced the engine, brakes, suspension,
and so on, I had $6500 into it (still has original paint and body dings).  It is
a nice $3000 Westy now.  At least here in &quot;RustFree&quot; California.  Been to Mexico
on a 3500 mile tour, Northern to Southern California expeditions, ect.

Only Mink knows how much she is willing to spend.  I would advise her to try and
find a 68 to 71, or a 75 to 79.  The 2.0L 76 to 79 would be the premier choice.
Try to avoid the dual carbed versions.  Depending on her repair skills and those
of her boyfriend, she should try to find the best bus in the best condition she
can aford, with repairs they can handle.  It should run and drive like any good
used car.  And don't accept, &quot;They're all like that.&quot;   Find a trustworthy VW
mechanic and pay them to hour or two labor time to fully inspect any prospective
purchase before the deal is done.  If the owner won't agree to this, I'd pass.
Most used cars I have purchased usually ended up needing $1000 or so worth of
maintenance and repairs over the first year of ownership.

Mike D.
