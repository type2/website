i have repaired worse ,,,and instead of primer spot in the sections with a 
comparable spray bomb ,,and drive the thing ,,look how long i drove the old 
bronco ,,now that was a beater to beat most ,,,seriously ,,it can probably be 
brought back to the specs even with the damage ,,,,then spot it in till you 
get the funds to do a complete redo of the paint,,i think i may have a 
painter in our area to do these things finally ,,working hard on that now 
,,if i can help chris just yell ,,later
