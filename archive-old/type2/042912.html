Hate to say it,

But, the plug is steel and the case is aluminum, so probably the case.

I have stripped many a fastener, and there arent always shavings, the
threads can just get buggered up where you cant tighten something and
generally look okay...

If it is stripped, you might be able to run a tap in there and fix it, but
im not sure i have never had a problem with that specific fastener before.

good luck,

Steve
