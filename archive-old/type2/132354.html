&gt; Okay, now this is wrong. A collector car is, by definition, one that is
&gt; in more or less original configuration. And such a car will pass smog.

You missed my point slightly. I'm saying these cars will have a minimal
chance to become collectors items.

Collector cars don't all grow in Barns. They are restored to original
condition often by the substitution of parts from donor vehicles. The less
donor vehicles there are due to the fact they went to the crusher after
failing smog the fewer collector vehicles there will be.
