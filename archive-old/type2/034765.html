Subject: Re: seatbelts and 5 passengers in a late Westy:

I have a 78 Westy, and added the seatbed from a 74 Westy because it
holds 3 adults- removed the ammonia fridge and use a Coleman portable
instead.  
The rear seatbed in a standard 77-78 Westy typically has 2 lap
seatbelts- one by the passenger side window, and a lapbelt in the
middle.  I used shoulder belts taken from the front of another Westy;
the attachment for the passenger side shoulder part is present along the
wall just under the window.  A similar hole is under the window about 2&quot;
into the closet behind that thin panel; I tapped into that for a
shoulder belt on that side.  The medial mount is doubled onto the middle
seatbelt mount.  The lower lateral mount by the wall is achieved via a
3/8&quot; bolt placed thru the X-brace seen behind the paneling next to
seat.  A shoulder belt is more critical in this seat, since without it a
passenger COULD swing forward at the waist and hit the sink/storage
cabinet.  If you get attachments, I can send pics with our new digital
camera!  I don't have a website; if someone offers space for these pics,
I can upload them- including the numerous other modifications I've done!
