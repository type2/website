Subject: aux. gauges
Mime-Version: 1.0

hello list!

i'm am in the market for aux. gauges for my 75 westy before i hit the road 
x-country.  my &quot;gauge connection&quot; through a vw racing friend is quite 
busy....and i'm still waiting for a price quote.

i want to get:  an oil temp, an oil pressure and a voltmeter.  my racing 
friend recommended autometer gauges.

anyway, does anyone have any suggestions as to where i can shop for these 
suckers?  jcwhitney does not have the oil temp gauge, but they have the 
other 2.  i really don't want to buy the vdo gauges due to the price 
increase from autometer.

i would love some list input!

thanks in advance!
