Hang in there, Matty !!!
LOTS of people are only one paycheck away from homeless.
As for your question, valves too tight will not allow a sealed
combustion chamber, causing poor compression ( burnt valves ).
Loose is a little less power and far safer.
Think of the boundaries of the combustion chamber.
You have a cylinder sealed with the rings at one end
and the head / valves at the other.
Many factors contribute to the loss of compression-
Keeping oil clean and the air filter system intact,
not overheating or stressing the parts at their limit
to name a few.
Scratches in the cylinder, large ring gaps, worn ring lands,
low torque on head , case /  head studs not secure,
valve seat imperfections, worn guides and valves, cracks,
carbon build-up on valve stems and seats, warped heads,
worn pistons,all contribute to loss of comprression.
So there is is- Empathy. and Entropy.

&gt; hey all,
&gt;
&gt; just wanted to email and let everyone know that i am
&gt; alright and still a part of this list. its just hard
&gt; to keep up ona couta im homeless. its ok though, not
&gt; really that bad. i move into my new house in 9 days!!!
&gt; at which point i will be more involved in the list.
&gt; just wanted to let everyone know, on the off chance
&gt; that anyone cared:-)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; BTW- can anyone throw some possible causes of low
&gt; compression at me. besides the obvious ones like bad
&gt; rings. could mal adjusted valves cause low
&gt; compression?
&gt;
&gt; thanks all,
&gt;
&gt; Matty
