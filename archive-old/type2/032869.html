Subject: list history

I got a message from a recent subscriber with some questions.  Reading
them I decided that it has been a while since there had been any
discussion of list history.  Many of you have been around a while and know
these things, but every week I see a dozen or more new members sign on, so
here is a bit of list history... (it is Friday, after all :-)  It occurs
to me also, that despite the &quot;complete&quot; archives we maintain, a social
history might have some value.  Something to think about :-)

'73 Westy (awaiting VA inspection)
'80 Westy (runs just fine now that it's cold (LOVE that BA-6! :-)


&gt; Steve,
&gt; 
&gt; Do Friday tom-foolery messages need to be &quot;flagged&quot; as such so some
&gt; sort of utility can purge them?

Well, it's like this... Silliness on Friday is an old tradition here.  
Runs of requests for (f) tags occur by times, but compliance is
hit-or-miss at best.  Using the (f) tag would be nice, but I like the idea
of Friday silliness, so I am loathe to ask for regulation of any kind
since it tends to kill the silliness.  After admining the list for a while
and having to keep traffic on topic the other six days, I am happy enough
if the Friday discussions tail off as Friday ends :-)

&gt; Also, what is &quot;v_at_l&quot; or FRIDAY.TGIF ?

V_at_L...  this list started off in 1996(?) as a list for all VW buses run by
a guy named Gerry Skerbitz (sp?) at U of MN.  The address was
vanagon_at_lenti.umn_dot_edu.  When Gerry quit, we split the list in two, between
air and water cooled buses, water cooled vanagons moved to
vanagon_at_vanagon_dot_com and Ken Hooper started type2_at_type2_dot_com to cover air
cooled buses.  Two years ago, the aircooled list split again between early
buses (1950-1967) on vintagebus and late buses (1968-1983).  When we got
our own machine the question of what the machine name ought to be... I
thought the answer obvious :-), which is why the machine name is
lenti.type2_dot_com (type2_dot_com works fine, so many of you don't see it :-)

on FRIDAY.TGIF, I have no clue :-(  Anyone?

&gt; ALSO... where's the &quot;registry&quot; I read about?

Thom Fitzpatrick runs a registry for split window buses.  Because there
is a lot of cross-posting between the vintagebus list and the type2 list,
mentions of it turn up by times, but AFAIK (as far as I know), there are 
not registries for bay window buses or for vanagons (volunteers? :-)

&gt; 
&gt; So many questions, so little horsepower...

AMEN! :-)
