Subject: Re: [T2] Sythetics, and air cooled engines

Thanks guys---
The reason I brought this article up is, I have read it before ,and as
the type 2 is air cooled and does run mostly hotter as a bike engine
does, the oils mentioned here are totaly relevevant to the VW air cooled
engine---

While I do use the Golden Spectro, which is not tested here it is an
excellent oil that will prolong an engines life span, much as Mobil 1
does, but I feel it has beteer shear retention than the mobil 1 only
becuase of the transmissions in the bikes being internal,and requiring
more of this lubrication protection.

Good charts and explaination of the viscosity drop off points of the
common oils---
