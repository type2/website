Subject: Re: [T2] Wiring a tow lighting harness into the bus

cool. Looking at the wiring diagram. I see the spots. But, the brakes are
touchy...but I have to disconnect my brake booster. And as long as I am
down there....

&gt;&gt;  Need some insight on how to wire the lights of a 79 loaf to be towed.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;   Where do I hook into the running lights, brake lights and turn
&gt;&gt;   signals?
&gt;
&gt; Chuck,
&gt;
&gt; First, the rental set from whatever company rents you the dolly is just
&gt; *easier*, as it will plug right in and clamp on.   The two times I have
&gt; towed cars for any distance, that was the way I went.
&gt;
&gt; But, second, if you want to use the vehicle lights you can either run a
&gt; harness along the side of the bus and plug them in at the tailight
&gt; buckets or do as follows for direct connections to the systems:
&gt;
&gt; driving lights - just turn them on;
&gt;
&gt; brake lights   - there is no fuse between the switches on the master
&gt;                 cylinder and the lights.  You would need to unplug the
&gt;                 wires from the switches and plug in your feed from the
&gt;                 towing vehicle.  The wiring diagram indicates an eight-
&gt;                 connector multi-plug between the switch and the lights
&gt;                 in the rear, but I don't remember where that connector
&gt;                 is located.
&gt;
&gt; turn signals   - the easiest place to feed power to the turn
&gt;                 signals is at the emergency flasher switch.  Look for a
&gt;                 black wire with a green trace (right) and a black wire
&gt;                 with a white trace (left).
