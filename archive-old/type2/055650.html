Subject: First trip in a '78

It's wonderful to have such a great resource here. I just took ownership
of a  '78 bus and am moving from Iowa to Wisconsin next week.  Besides
leaking a little oil and the cold start mechanism missing/broken the
engine seems to run good. I know the thermostat is not hooked up (the
cable is cut). What, if anything would you reccommend I check to make
this madien voyage uneventful? Thanks for the advice. Tyler Wiese
