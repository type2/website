I'm assuming a glass pack is louder than a quiet pack...Also a glass pack
should/might be less restrictive than the other...On a Bus, this probably
won't make a noticable difference in performance altho' there's plenty
of money being made by manufacturers of coffee can sized exhaust
tips and non-silenced aircleaners...Remember the Boy Racers Motto:
&quot;Noise Equals Speed&quot;... ;-)
