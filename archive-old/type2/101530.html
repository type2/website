Subject: Warm Bus equals Happy Driver!!!!

With all this dry winter weather we are having, it's been fun driving the
bus around and not have to worry about the salt.  But keeping warm is always
a concern with the temps in the teens.

Well, I just got finished refreshing an underdash South Wind heater in a
friends double cab that hadn't run in a number of years.  I had forgotten
how much heat those underdash units put out.  If you don't like getting into
a cold bus, these gas heaters are the ticket, even with the outside temp a
bit lower than 20 degrees F, I had this double cab heated up to the 70's in
no time and I hadn't even started the engine!!

I know some people have a fear of gas heaters, but I wonder if they've ever
really seen one run, or taken a ride in a gas heated bus, I'll bet they'd
change their tune in a hurry.  Just a flip of the switch and you have
instant heat at your feet, the only noise inside the cab is the blower
running.  No exhaust fumes, just clean hot air, no different than the
propane or natural gas furnace in your house.

If I ever find the time, I'll have to put up some picutures on my web site
of the step by step process rebuilding a SW heater, really pretty easy if
you do it one step at a time.  If you can rebuild a carb, you can rebuld a
gas heater and enjoy a warm if not HOT bus in the coldest weather.
