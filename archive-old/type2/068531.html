Subject: Re: Westfalia Sticker-- here?

To All that inquired about the Westfalia &quot;Prancing Horse&quot; 
sticker.. (not to be confused withth e &quot;WESTFALIA&quot; lettering 
that Ron Salmon and others were referring to...

I looked at my Westfalia &quot;Prancing Horse&quot; red white and blue 
stickers that I got from Michael Stienke in Germany last 
night (assorted sizes) and there is one that looks very 
close to the correct size that would have graced most bubble 
window Westfalia's.

I will post Michael Steinke's address on Monday.

My only complaint about the sticker (it is a perfect repro) 
is that prolonged exposure to sunlight seems to cause the 
colour in the sticker to fade. Other than that I think the 
sticker would work very well on the pop top.

I have no affliations w/ Michael other than a mutual 
interest in Westfalia's
