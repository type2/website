Subject: Steel fuel line connection

Todd (and list)-
I would like to ask about installing the steel fuel lines.  How did you make the
first connection at the fuel tank?  Did you solder, weld, glue a connection on? 
I have been interested in the steel braded lines I see on race cars but didn't
know how to fit the first threaded part onto the tank. How is it done?
Thanks,
John Ingram
