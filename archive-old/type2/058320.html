I have a res. at the local KOA as do a lot of other VW owners- KOA # is
914-246-4089.  Show is Sun next to the Town Hall; all VW's are shown ($10
entry) and the owners judge the cars!  There is a model/toy show also.  Had
a good # of busses last year-there's a vendor who has welded a bug top to a
Bus!   Anyone coming from Va/MD/DC can stay over by us Fri night-we are 40
min above Philadelphia near Princeton, NJ.  See ya there!
