First thing. Replace your feul lines.
You will not hear that enough from this group.

I have to pull my gas tank, too, so I will be watching this thread. You will have to pull the engine AFAIK and the firewall in the front of the engine compartment. As far as the particulars, we'll watch and see what the experts here have to say.

Welcome and enjoy your new family member!
