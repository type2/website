Argh!
My 71 westy (1600 DP)with an S.I.R. rebuild with only 8000 miles on it is 
driving me crazy. I went to do my routine valve adjustment, which I have 
done dozens of times since buying the bus last year, driving around the 
country, blowing 2 engines (long story). So I think I know what I'm doing 
with regards to valve adjustment - the bread and butter of VW maintenance.
Anyway, I started by checking and torqueing the head bolts (all a little to 
a fair amount loose - maybe 14ftlb to 22 ft lbs. -0 of course only the lower 
4 on each, I know that will cause some controvery since some say you MUST do 
all 8 with engine out...anyway I get equal number of opposite opinions on 
this) then I put on the rocker arms, torqued those, then adjusted valves.

Valve 1 intake  and exhaust ok,
Valve 2 intake too tight(adj. screw out - no feeler gauge will fit), but 
after unbolting and rebolting rockers ok, 2 exhaust ok,

Then - 3 intake and exhaust - NO WAY CAN I GET A GAUGE IN! even with taking 
out the screw. I take the rocker arms off a few times, carefully try to make 
sure push rods are seated well - no luck. I even crank the engine a few 
times to see if they will reseat and loosen up - but no dice. And to make 
matters worse - I look at #2 and the push rod had come off the rocker arm 
alltogether!

Frustrated, I take the rocker arms from heads off my old engine (the new 
heads had only 3000 miles on them. They look so nice, you know?) I was 
careful putting them on , carefully unscrewing all the adjusting screws so 
as not to crunch a valve, #1 intake - first one I look at- now will not 
allow me to put a gauge in, even with screw out. I take out rocker arms 
again a few times - still can't get a gauge in.

What gives? What am I doing wrong? I could shim the rocker arms to get the 
adjustment, but that doesn't seem to fix the problem or discover what I'm 
doing wrong.
Before doing all this, the bus ran fine, except minor idling problems, which 
I attribute to valve adjustments and maybe idle/fuel/air screws...
HELP PLEASE - I'm trying to get on the road for a couple of weeks...
