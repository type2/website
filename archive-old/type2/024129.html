Posting a couple of questions for Bob Perring on the road in Utah.  He and 
Mary Beth are on their grand 2001 road trip in Casper, a '70 Westy, running a 
1600 SP engine, about as stock setup as you will find.

He has a spare dizzy, part number 113-905-205P, vacuum advance, but needs to 
know what it is from and the specs.  He hasn't been able to find any data on 
it.  The Type 2 library shows it as being used on a '68 Autostick bettle, 
Karl, any confirmation/info for him?  Anybody on the list have the tuning 
specs for this dizzy in a bus?

Secondly, he wonders what folks living at 9-11 thousand feet time their 
busses at.  Jason Z, Craig....any thoughts?  What year are your busses, type 
of dizzy/engine and how do you time for high altitude?  He advanced it for my 
altitude here in Colorado Springs, and Casper took him over the passes at 11 
thousand plus ( I think he went over Monarch on highway 50) but needs some 
data for use out in Utah.
Reply to me and the list and we will get the data into the archives for 
future use.
