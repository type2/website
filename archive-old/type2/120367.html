Subject: Re: [T2] Reattaching oil pickup in a 1600cc engine

&gt; Last time I changed oil (1600cc engine) the longer stud that holds the oil

&gt; I would like to reattach it before any serious damage is done. Anyone have
&gt; any tips?

Coming as it does on the heels of the discussion of red versus blue
loctite and when and whether to use which this is a fascinating post.

Arathorn, there is no way I know of to reattach the pickup tube to its
stud short of splitting the case.  This stud is one of the rare places
where using a high-strenth permanent threadlocker product during initial
assembly makes sense.  Of all the fasteners on the engine this is the one
that is most likey to come loose in normal operation and the price of
repair is very high.

If anyone has gotten the stud back in and a nut on it in any way but by
splitting the case, I would love to hear it!

                             OOK!
