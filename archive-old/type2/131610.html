Subject: Fuel Pump and Relay Testing

Last week or the week before I posted questions about testing the double 
relay and fuel pump. Someone posted a list of things to check on the double 
relay and what to look for. Greg Potts maybe. I lost the pages that I 
printed and didn't save that email. I have lost quite a few things during 
this move. I am sure they are there I just can't find them yet.

Word to the wise, if you just happen to own a Replica Claymore Mine(for 
Training) don't throw it out in your garbage. I did and got to see the bomb 
squad in action today. I did however get to be on the news and now the 
reporter is hot on the trail for ex-Landlord about other issues.

Thanks,


Michael Knight
