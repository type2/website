&gt; Whoops!  You are correct!  OH, boy... this complicates things... I sense
&gt; an upcoming outbreak of religious warfare between the engine-only and
&gt; engine-trans pulling schools :-)

Steven, you and the Everybus attendees can help end this schism once and for
all with a Fun Contest.

Start by fixing Troy's Bus.

Then let the engine-only people pull and reinstall Troy's engine. Time the
drop &amp; reinstall.

Finally, let the engine-trans people pull and reinstall his engine. Once
again, time the operation.

Whoever gets the engine in and out the fastest (demerits for squishing team
members under the engine) Knows The One True Way.
