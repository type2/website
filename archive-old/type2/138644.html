Subject: RE: Vinyl Killer VW Van

&gt;From: Tracey Estevez

&gt;Has anyone seen these little busses that cruise around a 33rpm vinyl album
&gt;and play the music? Kinda expensive, but cute as heck.

I saw one last year also heard it play. It was a splitty version. On the 
samba if you look up VWGURU he sells a lot of toys on there from Winston 
Salem, NC. Cool guy. German cars and a german wife to boot.
