Your 22 psi oil pressure at 3800 rpm seems a bit low to me. Maybe you
could switch to a somewhat heavier oil? If you can find a mechanics gauge
(with direct reading), I would doublecheck the oil pressure in the
driveway. 

Another data point: 1975 Westy, 1800 fuel injected, high revving (like
3,900 rpm at 65 mph), oil temp 260 F, oil pressure 40-50 psi (gauge needs
to be replaced), outside temp ~70 F, total advance 38 deg (a bit much),
low CO emission (lean running), Mobil 1 15W-50. I think oil temp was 10-20
F less with Castrol Syntec 5W-50. Oil temp also seems to vary degree for
degree with outside temp (i.e., 270 F at 80 F).
