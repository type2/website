&gt; I would like to pull the engine in my 80 Westy.  The archive instructions

&gt; engine in the first place).  

&gt; Is it really necessary to have the trans in neutral?  

no.  It is easier, but not necessary.  Pull the spark plugs out, jack the
bus up and put both sides on jack stands so that both tires are clear of
the ground.  You have to be able to rotate the tires to get to all the
bolts holding the CV's on.  In normal circumstances, this means putting
the trans in neutral, but if the wheels are off the ground and the spark
plugs are out, you can rotate the tires, trans, and engine, no sweat.

&gt;If so, maybe just removing the nosecone would be a better way to go?

On a vanagon, the shift is mounted on the side of the trans, not the
front.  In addition, the nose is one of the trans mounting points.  I
think you cannot pull the nose untill the trans is out. Now, *in theory*
you can pull the trans on a V'gon w/o pulling the engine, but I think it
would have to be on a lift, plus you have to support the front of the
engine... all in all, not worth the effort, unless you have a bet on :-)

Have you tried disconnecting the linkage and then shifting it?  there is a
chance that the problem is in the linkage, not the trans.  If you can
shift it with the linkage disconnected, then (a) you can work on the
likage only (which is much cheaper :-) and (b) don't have to futz wiht the
plugs :-)
