I went to change the oil and noticed that the oil did not smell right and
after some consulting to see if what I smelled was actually what I smelled it
was a unanomious decision that I have gas in my oil.  How did it get there and
what should I be looking for?  This is a brand new long block and I wonder how
much damage I could have done to this motor?
