Subject: Re: [T2] BN6 Heater - Voltage Metering _at_ the Fuel Pump?

Every year the pump in my BA6 stops working.  Every year I give it a wack
with a screwdriver, windshield scraper, or whatever's convenient and it
starts working again.  It's pretty easy to tell if it's going or not, I can
almost hear it from inside the bus.  If I feel it, I can definitely tell if
it's going or not - the pump pulsates in time with the pulses from the
combustion blower.  I don't even have to take the bottom cover late off
anymore.

I don't think I've tried measuring the voltage at the pump, but it doesn't
surprise me that you can't see the pulses.  Is this a digital or analog
meter?

Peter
