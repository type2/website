Hi Dallas
It seems you've got fuel troubles from you description.
one thing that I recommend, is to get a fuel pressure gauge,, they let you
borrrow them at CANADAIN TIRE and the like
if you know that you have fuel pressure  getting to the carb, you can
eliminate one variable.. and track down the rest!
recently.. I went thru this,, and I had to route the gauge into the bus, and
have a friend watch it as I drove,, to prove that it was loosing
pressure,,,,
The pump rod was not set up to the correct lenght for my bus..

Hope that helps...

Subject: Intermittent Power loss/ Stall


&gt;My 68 bus has an annoying habit of stalling after about 30min of driving
&gt;(although it has happened right away). It stalls and then won't start for
&gt;about 5min. Sometimes it doesn't completely stall it just loses power for a
&gt;few seconds and kicks back in.I've tried two different dizzy's 1 vaccum and
&gt;1 009. Tried two different carbs. It started happening after I replaced my
&gt;carb, fuel pump and fuel filters/ hoses and my points all in one day.
&gt;Sometimes I can see bubbles in the fuel line where it goes into the filter,
&gt;what are those from? This is a most annoying problem because I can't
&gt;recreate it on demand, although it happens practically every time I take my
&gt;car out. ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHH Help someone please!!
