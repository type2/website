Holy cow, guys. I have a tennant who is an authorized eberspacher dealer.
Who on the list would be interested in a group purchase if I can get him to
import some of the &quot;petrol&quot; models?

&gt; The heater I had in my 78 worked great.
&gt; I drove it back from Edmonton one winter in -41 Celcius I was soo darn 
&gt; cold it wasn't funny. Wind blowing snow all over the place you 
&gt; couldn't see. It was putting out good heat but the wind was stripping 
&gt; it off the bus faster than it would put it out. I was in my insulated 
&gt; coveralls and over that I had an army sleeping bag good to -50ish or 
&gt; something.
&gt; I was sooo cold it wasn't funny.
