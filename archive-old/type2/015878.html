&gt;My question for the day is:  Are Vanagon's geared *way* lower, is this
&gt;engine *way* more powerful than I think, or am I dreaming???  The pads are
&gt;out of the (metal) lid and the rear cushion is still sitting in the
&gt;garage, so there may also be an exageration of the sound, but...  I tend
&gt;to shift &quot;by ear&quot; and my ear is telling me to shift about a 10-20 mph
&gt;lower in this new van than in my loaf.  That is, I'm in first to ~5,
&gt;second to 10, third to 35 and I ain't been in 4th yet, but I am betting
&gt;the engine will be at &quot;jumping out&quot; pitch at about 55-60.  The speedo dots
&gt;tell me to shift at about the same places I am used to, but the pitch of
&gt;the engine tells me we are geared for stump pulling, not highway cruising.

It should be similar to your 091'd loaf.  I'm guessing your ear is out of
whack.  :)
