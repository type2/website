&lt;lurker mode = off&gt;

Hey There Everyone,

Bought my first VW (oct '98, 78 westy 2.0, FI, Auto), and the archive
and list have been very helpful. Replaced the starter, (the 17mm nut
was a tough one to find). Engine would crank, start and die (check the
vacuum lines) etc. If only I could get the computer closer to the van. 

Here's a question that has been bothering me for a while. DPO really
went to town on my bus. Looks like they removed the heat exchangers
(just pipe from heads to muffler), connectors from the heat exchangers
to tube that ducts air to the front, and the heater blower. Shouldn't
the heater fan be mounted right above the engine with tubes running
down to where the heat exchangers used to live ??? Found one half of a
inline fuse and I'm guessing that the other half is gone with the
heater blower and rest of the heating system. Pmail me as this
probably will bore everyone else.

TIA
