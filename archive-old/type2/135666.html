Subject: I got it running!!!

The starter that was in there tested bad. No load drew 300 amps! And
the bearings were shot, the armature was bouncing and rattling like
mad. So $60 later I have a rebuilt one from Kragen. Nice, it came with
the bushing too!

I found the top bolt:

It was easier to just remove the aircleaner than to try and get my
meaty hands back in there. 17mm nut if anybody's curious.

Here's the old starter:

Notice anything? Like the WRONG PART NUMBER? Grrr... The housing was
several inches shorter than the new one:

The housing on the rebuilt one has the correct (per Bentley) part
number cast into it.

I had replaced the battery cables before, but it turned out that the
clamps which I had reused (wingnut clamps) were adding 45ohms of
resistance even when I buried the probes into the soft metal. (Is this
possible? The wires themselves only showed 4.5 ohms on the short
negative cable and 8 ohms on the long positive cable.) Anyway,
replacing the clamps did the trick. I probably could have gone a while
longer on the old starter, but it was so trashed I'm glad I replaced
it now instead in a parking lot somewhere.

I'm inside taking a break before going back out and dealing with this mess:

As you can see, I was going batty! heh I still need to find why I'm
not getting power to the ingition wire. I had to run a jumper from the
battery to the coil to drive it.

Wish me luck! ;-)
