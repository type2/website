&gt; Thanks for the theories and explanations on studs over bolts.

&gt; Where can I find the thread size and overall length?

&gt; Do I really want to use a torch on the head, to get the studs out?

If you have to.  Remember that aluminum expands faster than steel, so a
hot head has less grip on its studs than a cold head.

I find a 450 degree oven often gets things hot enough to release studs.
Double-nut the stud before you put the head into the oven so you will be
able to get a wrench on it right away after you remove it from the oven.
