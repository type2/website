Subject: RE: [T2] 72 heater controls

Dang I hate it when I send of stuff then see something got lost or miss
spelled  

After the line:
The flapper on the pipe, up front and under the dash, going to the
defrosters work opposite of what it looks

I wanted to also say:

When the knob is pointing upwards it is sending heat to the lower vents at
your feet, thusly if the knob is pointing down then the heat is going to the
defrosters.

Subject: [T2] 72 heater controls


Hi All,

I finally got my 72 out of the garage and back on the street!  Problem 
is, I don't know how to use the heater controls (the knobs/handles are 
missing and I am freezing when I drive it.  I can work the controls 
from under the dash but I need to know the combination that is likely 
to allow some heat to come my way.

Any help is always appreciated!

Thanks,

Dave
