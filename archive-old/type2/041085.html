which one has the automatic, the engine or the van?? makes a difference.

&gt; the reason i'm asking is my engine is totaly toast and i need to buy
&gt; another. so i was wondering if i was limited to van engines only, or if
&gt; i could put a bug engine in my van as an alternative too? thanks for the

people have put bug engines in vans BUT a van weighs a LOT more than a
bug, bus engines for the most part are larger, also an automatic is only a
three speed so you put even more strain on the system
