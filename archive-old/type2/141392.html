Vac advance can be up to 15 degrees, depending on the engine, carbs, and
elevation.

It's amazing the # of guys I tell to change the belt to help cool the
engine, and they give me gasps of disbelief. All the &quot;experts&quot; have chased
around for months on other &quot;problems&quot; and seemingly overlook the obvious.

PS: Busses should also use an Alt belt, they are already on the ragged edge
of keeping cool, better safe then sorry. I use alt belts on everything, they
are cheap insurance to keep the engine cool.
