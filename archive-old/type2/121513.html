Subject: Re: [T2] Cheap Taps - It BROKE! Oh %^&amp;*!

Thanks!!!!!

I was greasing and oiling like crazy but the tap was just junk plain and 
simple. I think rather than cutting the threads it was stamping and 
squeezing them into the hole!

The first one broke because I was rushing it. The second should not have 
broken because I was not torquing it that hard - much less that the first. 
The first one complained the whole way so I should have had the better 
sense to stop. The second one gave no warning.

I'll try to slide something down into the flutes on opposite sides and see 
if I can twist them out.

Need some sort of Star Trek gadget to vaporize it. Oh - that's right, this 
is reality! &lt;grin&gt;

Chris


&gt;Sounds like a case of petrolis neglectus  when you were tapping the
&gt;hole--


&gt;I've also used a small needle nose vice grips and plier's and stuck them
&gt;in the slots on the side of the tap--and worked it out too--
