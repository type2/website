&gt; Everything from the fuel filter onward is 7mm high pressure line.
&gt; Use ONLY special high pressure line or you are asking for a fire.  I sell
&gt; it for about $7 a meter as I recall, on my website.

&gt; Does the Bus Depot sell a complete kit versus just the 7mm line?


A &quot;kit&quot; would basically consist of the fuel line plus a handful of clamps. I
don't sell the clamps, although they are relatively easily found in decent
auto parts stores, dealer, etc.  I do sell the fuel line because it is more
difficult to find locally.
