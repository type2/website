Subject: Re: [T2] Heat in a Bus

Hi,
there is a product I sed to insulate all my exhaust pipes, etc. Its 
fiberglass non-adhesive tape. Midwest Motorworks sells it. It stinks for 
a few thousand miles as the stuff smells a bit like waffles burning 
until the stuff finishes aging. Works great. You will need something to 
clamp it in place though. They sell ties that I didn't much like. I 
ended up using baling wire and hose clamps as they worked better and 
were snugger (more snug).

&gt; Also the U pipes are exposed and I could perhaps wrap these with 
&gt; something but I do not know what as they get real hot.  The up pipes to 
&gt; the flapper boxes could be wrapped in fiberglass and the flapper boxes 
&gt; as well.   Does anyone have
&gt; suggestions on what to do with the plastic accordion &quot;Mufflers&quot; and Y 
&gt; connection?
