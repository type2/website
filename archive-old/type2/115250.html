Subject: Re: [T2] 12vDC vs 120v AC for a fridge (was power converter  
  sources.)

Mike said:
 Um... I thought that the reference was to one of those $70.00, 12V fridges
 that comes with an AC adapter?

Cha said:
&quot;What is the difference in the fridge that comes in the vw than that of the
college dorm fridges?
besides that the plugs for a power source are diffrent?
i seen a cool little fridge in wal mart that would fit rigbt in the bus that
i could build my own cabinet round but how do i power it and keep the
battery charged if i it is to be powered byt the battery.&quot;

I took this to mean that Cha had seen a dorm-style fridge at Wal-mart. If
the question was about a Powered-Cooler style 12v unit, much of the same
applies.
You will still require increased charging capability and battery bank size.
In round numbers: A cooler drawing 4.5amps at 12v DC will kill your 100A/H
starting battery in about 9 hours (100 A/H divided by 2 to get usable
capacity divided by 4.5A minus a bit for efficiency loss).

These coolers (in my experience) chill enough to keep beer cold, but are not
really capable of keeping meat or dairy at a safe temperature.

That being said, if you want cold drinks while you are driving they are
great!

Cheers,
Matthew
Enjoying a cold drink (but not driving) as we speak.
