Subject: Re: [T2] 2.0 FI Addition

Sounds like it's running rich.  Has anyone messed with the AFM before
you?  But like mentioned in the previous emails, there are alot of
different things to test; injectors (for flow and leakage), fuel
pressure, pressure regulator, temp sensor II, etc.

If you can get it to run for long enough, make sure your timing isn't
way off.  If you're sure your ignition system is working, run through
the last chapter (FI) in the bentley and test everything to make sure
it's functioning correctly.

You might also want to consult the Bosch FI manual for troubleshooting. 
I'm sure someone on the list has the link to it...

&gt; Hey Guys,
&gt; 
&gt; I didn't want to start a battle of manuals on this
&gt; one! LOL
&gt; 
&gt; Just an update:  I have changed all the plugs, the
&gt; cap, rotor and points and the plug wires just to
&gt; eliminate chance of one of them being the problem.  I
&gt; also replaced the fuel filter, and the old one looked
&gt; like it was put on backwards! What a pain to do those
&gt; filters!
&gt; 
&gt; Nope.  It does try to start a little better, but will
&gt; only run for 20 seconds or so and then shut down. It
&gt; will not start after that.  If I leave it for about
&gt; half and hour and then try, it will again fire up, but
&gt; then shut down after said time period.  AARRGG!
&gt; 
&gt; One additional item: The exhaust smells very rich
&gt; while it is running and it runs very rough.
&gt; 
&gt; Lost in Loaf-Land!
&gt; 
&gt; Sam
