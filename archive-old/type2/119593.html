&gt;I don't think you can just change out the lifters without changing the 
&gt;cam, especially if it's damaged.  Also, the cam lobes might be flattened 
&gt;or worn if the lifters were not set correctly or stopped rotating.

I asked Steve and Debbie at Webcam some hydraulic cam questions once and all they would say was new should go with new. Of course they are in the business of selling cams but what they said makes sense. Now, if the rebuilder put in a new cam and old lifters it wouldn't seem a big deal to put new lifters. Does the cam wear against an old lifter that was broken in (not passed the wear limit)?

Practically speaking if you have a bad lifter and you want to replace it rather than split the case, how much is engine life reduced? Doesn't anyone know?

Put another way, after you break in a cam what happens to it that makes putting in new lifters later a problem?
