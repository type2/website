    &gt; Anyone have dealings with other shops in the area?
    
    my mechanic is picking up shop and moving to the Boston area come fall.
    he is one of the best late model bus mechanics I have found and he knows
    Fuel Injection.   I will be sorry to see him leave but his wife has gotten
    a great position in Boston so he is packing up all his &quot;Stuff&quot; and moving
    North.   His Name is Bruce Wilson, don't know where or how he will be set
    up but I have no qualms about reccomending him, with only one caution.
      he is frequently slow and doesn't finish when he says he will, mostly
    because he bites off more than he can chew, 
    
    if I know when and where he will be reopening I'll post it here, for now
    I'm getting a lot of stuff that I don't want to do done...
    

1. Auto-Bon Imports, Decatur Street, Cambridge (from Central Sq -&gt; BU Bridge)

2. Take a look at http://web.mit_dot_edu/johnbowe/www/bbn-auto/
which is the legendary BBN Boston Area Auto list, wholly venerable
and dating back to FTP and VT100s at least.  My pal John Bowe takes
care of it as a fifth generation lighthouse keeper, God bless him.
I'm copying the whole list to recommend that other locales copy
what I'm talking about.
