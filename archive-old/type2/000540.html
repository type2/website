	do I need therapy?

Well, many people would probably thik so (for driving a bus in te first
place).
Hell, what do they know? Do you care?

Most people think I'm crazy for owning 4 buses. They don't understand that:

- Running these buses cost me less than 1 avarage (new) family saloon, even
when you have to buy an occasional new engine or gearbox.
- Give you a new hobby for a liftetime
- Eliminate the need for a therapist
etc etc.

I guess it's just us who have seen the light ( ... and even without
reverting to herbs).
