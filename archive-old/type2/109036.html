Subject: Access a reality?

I searched in a variety of ways in both library and archive.  It's certainly
quite possible that I am not putting in the correct key words, so I am
breaking down and tossing this short question to the list.

When prepping a late model bay (i.e. removal of old paint) what is the best
way to access the visible body surface inside the air intake for the engine
compartment?  I have some pretty gnarly lichen in there that _has_ to go.
Are chemical strippers and bead blasters my only option to get to this?  an
acquaintance of mine is also having the same intake vent querie/body issue
with his late model beetle.  Understandably, a mechanical access solution
would yeild a different solution, unless of course chemicals and blasters
are the only answer.  Anyone scratched their noggin on this one?
