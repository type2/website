Bryan,
               Don't think about changing your air cleaner.  Just be certain
it is
well maintained.  My best suggestion for you is to get under the engine and
get familiar with your thermostat.  I don't remember now whether it is on
the right or left, but..... on one side the sheet metal will continue
forward in one piece, and curve upward.  That is not the side you want.  On
the other side, there will be an overlap seam allowing you to remove a panel
~6&quot; square.  Above that panel is your thermostat, a bellows-looking
gizmo around 2&quot; in diameter.  You can see it if you look with a flashlight
from the muffler end of the panel;  just don't burn your forehead on the
muffler.  When it is cold in the morning, the bellows will be tightly
contracted.  Take your bus out for a drive and then
check the appearance.  It should be expanded to the limit of its travel in
the squarish frame surrounding the bellows.  If not, remove it (1) and buy a
new
one immediately.  I have driven my bus all summer with the thermostat
out.... though some say this is not good practice.  At least it will not
cause an overheat condition.  Good luck!

(1) Any good workshop manual will cover this; p-mail me if you need
specifics on how.
