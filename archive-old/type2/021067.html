There are some very *interesting* items in the tour box now.  Its a riot 
to look through it all.  Unfortunatly I won't have but a few hours with 
the tour box, so my co-pilot will be doing our journal entry while we 
drive (in my 71 bus - Stella) to meet the next recipients.  I'm sure 
I'll scribble some things in there once we arrive though.
I've had the chance to see the box 3 times now, not counting this 
journey.  Once in Auburn Hills thanks to Chris Huff and the gang.  I 
even made an entry in the journal there.  Chris, are you still around? 
On a side note, despite all the mess with the tour box and all, she has 
got to be one of the nicest and most caring ladies I've ever met.  The 
world needs more people like her!!
Anyways... the next was at Buses Nowhere Near The Arch last year when it 
was handed off from the Canadian bunch (who made quite a trip down!!) to 
some DBG members.  The third was at a DBG event this winter where we 
were using the hub cap as a chip dish and drinking all the sample 
liqours...  kidding! kidding!  8)
Now I get to see it for a fourth time and kick it out of the midwest 
(well, sorta) off to the next leg of its journey.  I'll be sure to bring 
my digital camera and take some pictures of us and the box.
Maybe its a good thing I'll only have it for a few hours.  This thing is 
going to add some serious weight to the bus! :-)

Where is this thing going to end up anyways?!  Maybe the History Channel 
can do a documentary on it...8)

I'll have to find something good to put in there...hmmmm :-0

&gt; If it's the brown box that used to be a ladies cosmetic or small
&gt; overnightcase, it came from my attic!  I was the second/third hubcap
&gt; recipient (a lowly cardboard box sent to me and provided the classy
&gt; case, and everyone started putting vw related souveoirs (sp?) into it)!
&gt; I think each recipient should take OUT something and insert their own
&gt; memento!

&gt;&gt; The hub cap and tour box are alive and well.  Me and a fellow club
&gt;&gt; member are going down to pick it up Sunday and take it to Dubuque, IA
&gt;&gt; where we will be meeting up with some vintagebus listees from Nebraska
&gt;&gt; and doing the hand-off.  I thought you guys might like to know.
&gt;&gt; A trip report will most likely be posted on late sunday night or monday.
