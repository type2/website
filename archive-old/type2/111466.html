Subject: Re: [T2] pushrod retaining wire broken?????i need one

&gt;I don't think its that important. I've come across some engines without them
&gt;that worked fine.
&gt;
&gt;joey.

are you sure about this?
i would think that you would need them if the enigne originally has umm...?
are you sure we are talkng about sold lifters or hydraulic... dotn knwo fi that matters...?
i have solid lifters,,,
three of the push rods on the ends where the retainer clip broke are worn in a circuliar motion around close to the ends,,,,....

now looks like i am looking for a new set of push rods and a retainer clip...
like i said beofore anyone local got one....
i can ride the rods till i get some more but i dont think i am going to solo without the retainer clip...
thanks 
peace
