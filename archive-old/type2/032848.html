Subject: Friday Bus sightings

2 unrelated bus sightings yesterday.  One loaf, one splitty.

At the end of &quot;Friends&quot; last night, did anyone notice the psychedelic
black light poster of the loaf on the right when Ross was with the
Assistant Chef at her apartment after she turned off the lights?  I want
that poster.

As for the splitty sighting, I bought a 1:13 model yesterday made by
Solido of a early 60s Split Double Door panel (or 5 door) that was
purple and said &quot;Peace and Love&quot; on the driver's (left) side panel
area.  It also read &quot;Flower Powered&quot; on the driver's door.  If anyone
would like one, lemme know.  They had about 8 or 9 left in the store,
all the same.
