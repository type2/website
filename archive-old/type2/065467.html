- -----------------
I always worry that some PO has hidden a stash in my bus and that if it's
ever searched, say at a border crossing, I'll get busted.  Has this ever
happened toanyone?
- ------------------

Trying to cross back into Our Beloved Country after one of many 
low-budget, high-beer college road trips into Chihuahua state, a friend 
and I excited the arbitrary attention of the border police. I have no 
idea why, but they proceeded to unload all our junk from the bed of the 
pickup truck and brought out the dogs. They had those dogs all *over* 
that truck, in the cab, in the wheel wells, in the bed, all over our stuff.

Just then my friend elects to remember something. &quot;Oh!&quot; he said to me in 
a low voice.

&quot;What?&quot; I say.

&quot;I just remembered. That guitar case that dog is sniffing? That's where I 
used to keep my stash in high school.&quot;

But the dog turned out to be a lot more interested in the milk crates 
full of food, he never pointed (or whatever it is those dogs do). Scared 
the bejeesus out of me for a minute, though.
