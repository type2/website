Things just weren't the same without you. ;) Let me make sure I have this
right:

&gt;I brought back a 25 long block,
&gt;with the heads already removed, but the cylinders are stuck solid.   The
&gt;bottom of the case was corroded from the old oil turning acidic or
something,
&gt;and had holes in it, which I enlarged with a hammer.

You dragged an engine all the way back from England. A rusty engine with
holes eaten in it.

yup, how could I resist?   It was very cheap, and it is next to impossible to
find 25hp bits here.   Though the case was junk, it had a set of pistons and
cylinders, 75mm, and the 25hp crank pulley, for the wider fan belt, and the
cylinder tin .   I wanted to take them off before shipping, and just take
home the pieces i wanted, but they were used to being a unit.    I did get
the flywheel off, and gave it to Damon, Sarah's boyfriend.

(Did you check the thing as luggage or was it carry-on? How did the bomb
squad feel about this?)

i packed it is two cardboard boxes.    The heads in one, and the rest of the
motor in another.    I put in lots of packing stuffing, and reinforced the
boxes and taped them up sturdily.    I checked them in onto the airplane at
Gatwick, London.   The baggage scale read, I think, 54 kilos for the two
boxes.     They asked me what was in there, I said an old vw motor, and they
x rayed it as they do,   saw the big hunks of metal, discussed unpacking it,
decided to believe me it was a motor, and I carried on.       I did the same
at the airport in Atlanta, as I had a connecting flight.

Then when you got it back you went after it with a hammer and knocked
*bigger* holes in it.

Actually that was in Bristol, before bringing it back.
But I will take the grinder to it if neccessary, to get the pcs and cs off.


It was funny the differnce in stuff at the shows.  There is so much more
newer (water cooled stuff) and also more older (early 50 and 40s) stuff
there.  I saw a carb with the KDF logo on it at VW Euro.   and a guy with
boxes of NOS stuff, swing lever kits and bearings and kingpins and
doorhandles for splits.   There was a NOS sliding door handle for a 64-66
bus.   Wierd, who'd ever want it?     The handles belonged to this curt older
German man with a 66 or 67 high roof panel van, which has a tall and narrow
back hatch with a T handle.  He didn't speak much English, and I don't speak
much German so,  as it goes, it can be sometimes hard to communicate. Loads
of those early glass taillights, and I picked up some new decklid brake light
lenses cheap.   There were seat covers for early bus seats. There were 4
barndoors at the show, 3 were 53s, and one a 54, and all were panel vans.
    Two had come from England hauling Karmann Connections' swap stuff, one of
which had a crash box tranny.    I thought that stopped that in 52, but I
can't find my book to check,  it was a feb or march bus.   He thought he had
the original motor, but I told him it was a bug motor,  and such and such
parts were and weren't original.    I think guys dont like it when women know
more about their cars than they do, but maybe he was just having a grumpy
day, I do  try to be tactful.  I had to learn it from somewhere, just cause
for some wierd reason I want my 53 (standard) to be completely stock and
original.   I didn't find a drivers door handle for it, but I have a lead
now,  with someone who knows what part I mean.   In short, I was amazed at
the stuff there, though some was over priced, I thought.   But I enjoyed the
show.   I don't think they think much of buses there, there only one show
category for them, and about a dozen type I categories.  And there were a few
listmembers there  (We are everywhere)   the british crew and also Glen
Swanson and Brian Verbeek.
