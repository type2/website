Subject: FS: Ambulance fans &amp; Snap-on compression gauge

Hi Gang...

This is my last set of these...I don't see me restoring any more busses in the
foreseeable future, and want to buy some Matra tools, so it's inventory
reduction time...

Make me an offer, and they could be yours...selling regularly on e-bay for $225
or more...I'd like to see at least $150...these are really rare to find
ANYPLACE...

The compression gauge is the high end two piece snap together model, with very
little use...

Please P-mail me if you're interested...

I'm looking for Vanagon tables and curtains in case you're interested in a
trade...

Thanks, Den.
