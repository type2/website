&gt;In the cars for sale section is a Kemperink type 2. A Netherlands
&gt;coachbuilt 1972 extended length, high roof type 2 panel van. Similar to
&gt;a  US built cube van. Interesting to note that if you look closely at
&gt;the engine, it's a 1600! Sure hope they have the Alpine ratio transaxle!

 The Type2 Hearse and the single cab tipper at the same site are worth a 
 look too for all you Baywindow variant afficianardos.
 Hadn't seen one of the hearses before...Would be nice for carrying my
 Malibu surfboards.They hang out the back of my double cab...
