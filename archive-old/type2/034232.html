Subject: Re: greasing CV joints

Hi Paul and others -

There was a good article in a VW Trends (I think) about this.  Some mechanic
on the west coast made up simple plate that bolted on to the same patterns
as the inboard side of the CV boots.  It was just a flat plate with a grease
zerk in the middle.  You bolt it on, grease the race area full, then unbolt
and slide it off.  The joint is full of grease, nice and neat.  Bolt the
boot on and off you go.  Next time it's my turn, I'm definitely making one.
Maybe I'll draft it up and offer it out to the list, along the lines of my
engine trolley.  Sorry I can't remember the issue date.

Merry Christmas, all.
