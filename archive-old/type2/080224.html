Subject: Re: [T2] Ouch - Emergency body repair

&gt; If ya don't sand and primer, it will get worse. But do not stop at the
&gt; primer, try to get some touch up paint that closely matches your color,
&gt; primer is very porious and the metal will rust right through the primer.

Epoxy primers, such as PPG's DP series, are not porous.  You'll need to get
them at an auto paint store.  You can brush them on (mix with DP 402
catalyst), though you really should spray, and while you're there, you can
get some bondo, sandable primer and top coat.  Don't slather the bondo; just
skim it after you've used the hammer and dolly.  Read up a little on
technique, and you'll get good results.  Think of it as an opportunity to
acquire a new skill.

In the case of the door, you may have trouble getting behind it.  The
traditional approach was to drill holes, insert screws, and pull on them
with a slide hammer.  I prefer to mig weld a big nail, head first, with the
spike bent around and welded into a ring for the slide hammer's hook.  After
the dent's pulled you can grind the nail off and you don't have any holes.

As a footnote, I've heard criticisms of Bondo, sometimes by persons
commending Mar Glass.  I had always used a product called Evercoat, but I
decided to try the Mar Glass since the recommendation was strong.  It's a
very nice product, better than Evercoat.  The other day I read the small
print on the Mar Glass can and saw that the manufacturer is Bondo corp., so
maybe Bondo is ok now, I dunno.  Bondo (and its generic relatives) is like
beer and patriotism-- it's great when used appropriately, hazardous when
abused.

Grant
