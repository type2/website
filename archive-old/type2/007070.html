Thanks David, Tommy. and Al for all your help!
    With that knowledge in mind, I am wondering if a rebuild kit is
available and if so where and what would the part number be.  If a kit is
not available to rebuild would I need anything other than the gaskets,
flange, and push rod.  If so what else would I need.  Also if any listees
have a good or new OEM pump for sale please send me mail, perhaps this might
be easier. Again it is for a 1973 type2 carbureted.
thanks again

in response to Tommy's post about putting the inline engine in my diesel
van.  I had thought of this since I do have a good wasserboxer 1.9l engine,
but the process seems very difficult and from what I understand there are
quite a few parts I would need to find or have fabricated.  When I consulted
the vanagon_dot_com list they didn't seem to think this was the way to go. 
There are numerous conversions now available but the least expensive and the
easiest for a backyard mechanic seems to be the 1.9l diesel conversion.  If
it would be that much cheaper I might just find a good 1.6l eventhough I am
not happy with this, drop it in, and in my spare time rebuild the engine in
it now so when the other one blows I would have a backup.  If you have any
suggestions on this send me e-mail, I am sure the other listees are not
intereased in all this talk of vanagons
