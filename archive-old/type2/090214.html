Don't anyone try to swear off the bus or swear they love it yet. the
bus pics that everyone has seen is simply a concept vehicle. Has
anyone noticed that all concept vehicles always come w/ sharp edges &amp;
racy lines? I suspect the &quot;new&quot; microbus to be more traditional in
it's styling when it hits the streets. &amp; people will buy it cause, VW
does offer good service at many of it's locations for their newer
vehicles. This is a big selling point for some people, but
unfortunately for us they tend to turn their back on the air-cooled
bretheren.
