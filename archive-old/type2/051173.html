Subject: [T2] website &amp; question

Folks, I finally have the website online.  There's a VW page that has a
few links to some of my favorite &quot;family&quot; sites.  There's so many!
You could write a whole site about sites!
Please drop by  and let me know if you think I need some changes.

Question:  As you'll see, the Transporter needs some floor work.  I'd
like some suggestions as to how to approach it.  The outside body job
looks great although the PO used a lot of bondo on the front.  It
was an insurance write-off (doesn't take much for these old rigs) so
it's not in good enough original shape to do a restore.  I just want to
do a good job considering the condition.  Hopefully I'll be able to find

one sooner or later to do a proper restoration.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.
