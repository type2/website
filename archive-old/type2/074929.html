Subject: Re: [T2] Re: _at_!$! CA emissions test

On our 10K crosscountry trip I used muffler cement (sodium silicate
stove calk for cheapskates- coupla bucks for a LB can in hardware
store)  around a leaky upipe connection, wrapping it with
calk-impregnated thick woven fiberglass &quot;ribbon&quot; an electrical company
worker tossed out.  This holds up well (20K m in my case) but vibration
and expansion/contraction of the steel will eventually crack it.
My experience with long set epoxy is that it will withstand 400 degrees
without melting- found this out by accident when I glued a handle on my
woodstove.  Turns dark but didn't get soft!~  I suspect that's why JB
weld could work on heads and might on heater boxes?.  I took a rusted up
(full of holes) flapper box (between heater duct and heater box) ,
removed loose rust, and encased it in epoxy and it held up OK!

use Muffler Sealer for a very good patch.
I grind them with a rough sand paper on my 4&quot; grinder and lay a piece of
fiberglass fabric next to the metal, then smooth the muffler patch on in
very thin layers. Thick layers develop bubbles. After it is cosmetically
nice I bake it at about 300 degrees in the oven (eliminates about three
days of curing time and brings out flays in  your patching).
