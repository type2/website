&gt;According to the Bentley there was little difference in power between 
&gt;the 1.8 and 2L. The Bosch L-Jet FI system sets the mixture based on 
&gt;air-flow, so if your engine is pulling 10% less air it will reduce the 
&gt;fuel accordingly.

Is this going to be the case?

According to what I've read, the quantity of fuel injected is mainly a function of rpm at a known nozzle tip pressure. The pressure regulator adjusts the fuel pressure based on vacuum changes but the goal is to maintain a contant tip pressure because injector opening time is the variable based on engine RPM.

What if the 2L ECU is used on a 1.8L engine? We know that the vacuum pulled by the engine is going to be slightly lower assuming the volumetric efficiency (VE) of the engine doesn't change (The valve sizes are different so you could end up with a different VE). I don't really know how simple the fuel map of the Bosch L-Jet ECU is but if it considers the VE of the stock displacement and heads of the engine then there will be more differences when parts are swapped.

Lower overall vacuum means higher fuel rail pressure and therefore more fuel is going to be injected per combustion cycle than the engine is expecting for the displacement at any given RPM.

Some quick calculations tell me that lowering of the A/F ratio by 1-1.5 could easily compensate for this. Knowing that the engine can operate under a variety of fuel ratios with no apparent noticeable change other than what can be measured by exhaust emissions it probably seems like the swap has no effect.
