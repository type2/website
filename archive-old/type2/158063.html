Subject: Wanting a good foam - and NOT from a beer for a change!

I am looking for a decent grade foam to redo the
upholstery in my Riv. JoAnn wants $90 for a 4x24x76
and most foam places in Denver want WELL over $130. 

Any good sources you folks could steer me toward?

Hey Stiles, I hear you may be the man to talk to about
this. Do you have a source for fairly priced
upholstery foam?

-Jason
