Subject: Got the stripped oil plug

Nik --  An experienced VW/Porsche restorer told me years ago he didn't worry 
much about a few non-magnetic particles, since (relative to iron/steel) they 
were comparatively soft and did little if any damage.  All the same, he made 
good efforts to keep the crankcase clean, by blowing and flushing with kero or 
Diesel fuel followed by a couple of oil changes.

The JB Weld may work, but in my experience it loosens under heat in an oily 
environment.  Have you thought of using a Heli-Coil?  The kits for these are 
easy to find on eBay, or alternatively can be borrowed from friends on the 
list.  What is the thread you are dealing with?  One question will concern the 
shoulder on the drain plug and the available &quot;land&quot; on your case.  You will 
want the copper washer to seal over the Heli-Coil.    Best of luck.... Glenn

...I fished with a magnet and got all of the shavings out of the case (I 
hope).  My plan is to JB weld a new bolt in there and just change the oil 
through the screen.  Sound good?  Probably not permanent but I wonder how long 
I can expect this to work.  Is there another way?  I could re-tap the hole, but 
worry about non-magnetic case shavings getting inside...
