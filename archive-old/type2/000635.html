Hi Mark,
I've successfully bled brake that previously had made pulling my hair out.
I tried everything.  I had to break down and buy a MityVac fluid pump.  I
think I paid about $40 for it.  I then pumped the fluid out by suction while
at the same time having someone pump the pedal.  This combination of suction
from the pump and pressure from the pedal finally succeeded in bleeding
those buggers and getting all the air out.  They have bled easily and
normally on that vehicle ever since.  I even managed to unload the MityVac
for close to what I paid for it!

I would suggest trying just about everything else before you get the MityVac
since it is a tool without a whole boatload of uses that still costs more
than dinner.  But it WILL work if all else fails.

Good luck!

Hi Volks,
I can't seem to finish the brake job from he**.  70 bus, stock drums.  I
have replaced all wheel cylinders, shoes, rear drums, rubber hoses and
finally the master cylinder.  I have bled the system more times than I can
count, on my 4th quart of DOT3.  I've tried all the methods of bleeding from
all the manuals and tried a few tricks from the archives.  The pedal still
goes to the floor, but a couple quick pumps and it gets good and firm, up
where it should be. This means air in the system, right? The fluid comes out
clean, no bubbles.  I adjusted all the shoes, tight minus 3 or so clicks.  I
see no evidence of fluid leak. Am I missing something?  I wonder if the only
way to rectify this is a pressure bleed.
I also want to thank Steve Dolan, Ken Hooper and the rest of the List
Administrators.  You handle this diverse bunch of bussers perfectly.
