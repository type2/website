Subject: Hard BRAKES!!

Hey listies, I have a question about my brakes. I just got the 72 on the
road , but the brakes are a bit iffy . The pedal is really hard. I have to
put a lot of my 200lbs on it to stop. It did help after I put new calipers
and front pads on, now the rear brakes are pretty far out of adjustment,
would this cause the problem? Also which way do the stars turn to adjust the
rear brakes in? I did notice that there real hard the first 50% of the pedal
the they start to feel the way I would like them to , after I put the new
calipers, pads and bleed them.

Thanx

 

Ian Janes
