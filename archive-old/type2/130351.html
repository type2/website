Subject: Re: [T2] Need a VW in San Jose, CA

I got lucky, I saw a Westy on the Samba Classified. So I took a train from  
Bakersfield California to Clear Lake, Just North of San Francisco. I took the  
cash with me not knowing anything about the bus. 1971 Westy in great 
condition.  I bought it on the spot. That night I slept in it on the San Francisco Bay, 
with  a view of the ocean. The next morning I took the long way home on HWY 
101 along  the coast. I even went past Bakersfield on the coast and took HWY 
126 and came  down the grape vine into Bakersfield. Life has been good ever 
since. that was  two and a half years ago. Daily driver. weekend camper on the 
beach.
