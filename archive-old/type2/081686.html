Subject: Re: [T2] Westie Brackets? 

&gt; hi there everyone..this is my first time posting to the list. thanks for the
resource.
&gt; anyways..i have a 1970westie. my first vdub.
&gt; and i'm curious about a couple oddball parts on my bus.
&gt; i've already searched the library and didn't find any clues there, so...i've
come to u all.
&gt; first off, i have an inside bracket on each side of both of my front doors.
&gt; what went here? it looks like it's a factory option. and that they've
definately been used in the past. possibly supports for a child's cot?

Yes, those are the half-moon clips for the childs cot. Here is a page from the
68 Westy owners manual, same as a 70:

[I have a cot and bars if you want one, pmail me]

&gt; also i have a strange bracket of sorts on my front bumper on the driver
side. and it too looks like a factory option. any ideas?

Not a clue....
