Subject: parting out 80 vanagon and other stuff...
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.10.9910271049250.37773-100000_at_users.anet-stl_dot_com&gt;

hi all,

i am finally parting out my 80 vanagon... and i have some other stuff for
sale too... trying to clear out the shelves a bit.

only a very few of the parts on the 80 are spoken for.  i'm saving the
brakes, engine , CV's and most of the FI for my 82 westy.  Most everything
else is up for grabs.

the ECU is for sale/trade.  Its for an 80 vgon automatic, i need on for an
82 federal MT. 

The automatic in the bus is dead, but i have an automatic tranny that i
bought for the bus FS.  It is from a 77 that the owner converted to manual
tranny.  He said it worked great when he pulled it in 96 and i can see no
reason it would have gone bad since.  Included with this tranny are the
ring and pinion seals that often will go bad on these.  take it to a
tranny shop and have em put in to gurantee years of good service.  i
bought these from the dealer so they are good quality genuine VW
parts (ill have to check to make sure i still can find these.) i'd like to
get out what i have in it ($170) but am open to offers. i am told it fits
in 7? to the end of aircooled vgon production...

the 80 im parting out only has 83k miles on it, so many parts that would
be worn out on higher mileage busses are probably still good...

Also, i have a set of dansk heater boxes. they were brand new from the old
le-coz offer... i only put 3k miles on em and now they have minor surface
rust in places but are otherwise as new.  $275/obo

pair of like new dansk heater control boxes for an 80 vanagon(replaced
by le-coz, 3k miles on em) ... cant find a price for these new... $100 for
the pair??? (or if theyre cheaper than i think new, let me know)

front bumper is a bit dented but good chrome.  rear bumper is worthless.

sliding door works perfectly, no dents/rust.

anyway, if you need something off this van let me know, i'm trying to get
it out of my way within the next couple of weeks.

also have random baywindow parts from a 78.. including ac compressor, some
tin, and some other FI stuff... LMK what you need and i'll look.

peas,

Steve
