I'm an aircraft mechanic with 25+ years experience on airplanes from Piper
J-3 Cub to Boeing 727 and helicopters from Bell 47 to Sikorsky S-61N.  I
prefer helicopters.
Wife and I bought our first VW bus in late 70's because they were cheaper to
operate than the American vans.  As you can imagine, I've done most of my
own maintenance.
