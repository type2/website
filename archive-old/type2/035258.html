Subject: possible booster hose source

Got some very stout 1/2&quot; hose from a local supplier the other day to
replace my booster lines. I've been looking all over for steel reinforced,
but couldn't find it. Anyway, the wall on this hose is much thicker and
it's fiber-reinforced (not steel). It's actually pressure hose rated at
1000 psi. The best part was the price, which was $2.70 a foot (2.92 w/tax).
Based on what I've heard on the list before, I thought there might be some
demand for this, so I asked if they'd ship. Said they'd ship COD or
credit-card.

The supplier is Fluid Air in Memphis, TN (901)-384-6555 or 1-800-247-4673.
The description from my invoice is simply &quot;601-8&quot;. The guy I dealt with was
Allen Tickle. 

FYI: I haven't run the bus with this yet. I've only hooked it on up front
between the booster I replaced today and the metal line. It's too darn cold
and wet to stay out there and finish the rest of the run, but I'll get to
it tomorrow, no matter how the weather is.

Also, this stuff is too thick to fit through standard holes in the
firewall. I plan to run 1/2&quot; OD metal pipe through the firewall and join
this hose on each side with clamps.

I'll follow up if I see any problems at all, but I really don't expect any.
Don't hesitate to ask how it's going later on if you find this note in the
archives.

Thanks! Joe ('72 Riviera w/1800 AVP FI/hydraulic engine)
