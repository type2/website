&gt; Hey all,
&gt; I by pure accident found a way to get my dingy grey/brown mottled with
&gt; mold pop top bright white without chemicals and little effort!  On my
&gt; trip back from MN to Atlanta, I stopped at one of those self service car
&gt; washes. The reason was to spray the mass of dead bugs off the front of
&gt; the bus before we got back into the high heat of the south.  After
&gt; getting the bugs off and washing down the sides I aimed the spray wand
&gt; at the pop top. And much to my surprise it created a nice white strip
&gt; where I had sprayed. 

[Power spraying does the trick]

Last weekend, we spend most of our time cleaning our new (to us) '71 
Riviera, which had been sitting under a tree for several months 
prior to our acquisition thereof.  We actually used those green 
plastic scrub pads you can get in any grocery store, and for the 
type of dirt and mildew we were dealing with, they worked like a
charm.  No soap needed.  

My question is:  how can we treat the fiberglass roof so that it
becomes water-repellant in the same way that turtle wax makes the
paint water-repellant?  I noticed that water does not bead up 
very well on the roof, and since A) we don't actually look at the
roof all that much (&quot;out of sight, out of mind,&quot; you know) and 
B) we procrastinate and don't wash the car as much as I'd like,
I'd like to treat the roof so that it has some protection against
the elements. 

Ideas?  Suggestions?
