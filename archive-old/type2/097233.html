Subject: RE;propane power

Dylan,
    In 1980 I worked in Europe for about 6 months, on contract with
KLM Airline.  They had a fleet of VW Buses for use on the airport, by
the maintenance staff.  I can tell you that they ran and drove fine
but beyond that I don't know.  I guess I was more impressed with being
in Europe than with being in a propane powered bus, and didn't pay
attention to the details.
