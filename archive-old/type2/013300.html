Subject: Re: oil temp sender -&gt; leakage

Gregor -
Although I have not yet installed my sump plate oil temp sender, I've done
much research into the intricacies of the project - such as the frequent
leakage issue.  From what I've gathered, obtaining a new rubber O-ring to
seal between the engine case and the sump plate might help the leaking. I
have also seen where people have used RTV silicon gasket stuff on both
sides around both sender and nuts, with great results (even without the
copper washer). I also remember someone using teflon (plumbing) tape around
the nuts as a temporary leak fix - although I don't think this was
recommended for very long.  Good luck.
