Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Tire Report

&gt; I've seen Agilis, the new Yoko's, and the
&gt; Bridgestone RD's and I'm not interested in that
&gt; tires.  Just don't want highway rib tire.
&gt; Correct me if I'm wrong but Agilis doesn't even
&gt; have a M+S rating, right.  

The Agilis is an all-season tire with the M+S 
rating.  

Yeah, I was thinking Agilis 81, the version the
vanagon_dot_com guys talk about.  61 still isn't
aggressive enough for what I wanted.  At 55-60
mph, an AT or even MT tire doesn't have the
disadvantages it does at 75-80mph.
