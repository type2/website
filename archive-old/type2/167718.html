&gt; was Ebay buy it now, and buying it locally saved on shipping.  The unit
&gt; cost just north of $1000 and the tank was $225.  Espar has some petrol
&gt; variants, but prices are considerably more.  I wasn't able to find other
&gt; similar products.

Webasto has a similar unit, at a similar price
