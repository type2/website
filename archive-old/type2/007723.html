Hi List

One day, I pulled into a garage to find that all the 4 star petrol was
gone, so I just filled up with unleaded and thought nothing more of it.
Then the next time I filled up, unleaded (being so much cheaper) was the
obvious choice.

Then the bus starting running bad - it would backfire a lot, especially at
low revs (ie. below 3000rpm), and it wouldn't pull at all well from there.
So I stuggled with it, adjusting my driving style to suit this strange
performance until I had chance to investigate further. The other funny
thing is, when it did fall below, say, 2500rpm, I would push the
accelerator, but there would be a noticeable delay (1-2 seconds) before it
revved up. Then it would stay at 3500rpm or so for a few seconds (foot now
off pedal) until it reduced speed again. Weird!

I naturally thought: unleaded --&gt; lower octane --&gt; retard the timing. So I
did. No improvement. In fact, wherever I set the timing it wouldn't run
correctly (and I tried all over the place). Funnily enough, I ADVANCED it a
little and it ran better!

Eventually I gave up and promptly filled up with 4 star again - and after a
minor timing adjustment back to specification, it's running great again.

Now, maybe an aircooled VW engine (mine is a 2 litre, carburettor, CJ code
'Type 4' unit) SHOULD run okay on unleaded, but mine certainly didn't!
Could it be that a worn engine doesn't like it, and if so, what do I (we
all) do in the next millenium? Should we all be rebuilding our engines in
preparation, I wonder? Could be the most expensive unleaded conversion
around.......

What experience have the other listees had in switching to unleaded, and
how am I gonna do it (because I sure plan to be driving an aircooled VW in
the year 2000)?
