&lt;&lt; Just got another email from the seller of this bus and he says &quot;talked to
the local vw repair shop and they said it is a 21cc liquid cooled engine
that was a option upgrade for that van so it would have more power&quot;.  Must
have been some kind of option back in 1978.  He lives in Oklahoma, so maybe
they had some different options out there.  I guess that someone who doesn't
know what they have would be the worst kind of dreaded PO.
 &gt;&gt;

Huh? 21 cc is about the size of my moped motor...
This vehicle keeps soundin' more an' more like a &quot;project&quot; 
that's been thru' a few hands...Could be either a great find
or a disaster that keeps getting passed on...
