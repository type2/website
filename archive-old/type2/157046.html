Subject: Busquinox 06 Info Update

Hi folks, 
I have made the reservation, for which I had some
reservations, for Busquinox 06. 

Details, Details, Details:
Location:
Valens Conservation Area, Cambridge. ON. 
1691 Regional Road #97 - Fox Run Campsite
http://www.conservationhamilton_dot_ca/Asset/iu_files/map_valens.gif

Date: SEPTEMBER 23rd
We have &quot;FOX RUN&quot; from 2pm Saturday, until 1 pm
Sunday. (this is different from last year) 
When you arrive, please mention &quot;The Bug Pack&quot;. When
they look at you like you're crazy tell them the
reservation is under &quot;Narraway&quot;. If they still look
confused, tell them &quot;Fox Run&quot; and that should clear
things up. 

Cost:
$24 + tax at the gate. Also, I have an overhead of $53
which I will be splitting among all vehicles. The more
people, the lower the cost. Count on $5 each, but I
hope for lower. 

Activities:
We'll be having a lawn chair sitting skillz
competition 

Saturday night we will be having a fire. Feel free to
bring a donation of wood! Also, the Equinox has
special meaning to pagan folk... so..errr... feel free
to dance naked n stuff. 

The annual &quot;what time will the organizer show up?&quot;
pool will also be available for those looking for some
gambling fun. 

Sunday we will be doing pancake breakfast. Please
pmail me at adoom _at_ rogers_dot_com (remove spaces) if you
are wondering what to bring!

Valens has lots of cool stuff to explore, I encourage
everyone to bring a towel and hit the beautiful beach,
or bring a bike, or shoes, and hit some trails. 
More info is available at
http://www.conservationhamilton_dot_ca/parks/visit/valens.asp

This is meant to be a relaxing camp. There are no
awards or door prizes, but please save them and donate
them to the next event! 

Who likes Rules?:
Valens is a &quot;dry&quot; campsite. We have never been given
any trouble by following the Red-Cup rule. Please lets
continue this tradition, and keep your &quot;recreational
beverages&quot; concealed, and your behaviour family
friendly. If you are unsure on how to hide a beverage,
we will be holding a workshop on Saturday called &quot;Red
Cups and Thier Impact on Modern Camping Societies&quot;.

If you choose to bring a pet, please keep that pet on
a short (under 3m) leash, and clean up after it.
Monkeys included. 

Leave your &quot;world's loudest soundsystem&quot; at home. I
like bass as much as the next guy, but the neighbours
might not like your music &quot;mash-up&quot; of Manilow vs. DJ
Shadow as much as you. 

For more useless rules, details, and yammering, pmail
me at adoom _at_ rogers_dot_com (remove the spaces)

Thanks, 
Adoom
