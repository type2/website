&gt; I'm not sure what to check next.

Compression.

You need fuel, spark and compression to make your engine fire. It
would be a good place to start and relatively easy to check with the
correct hardware.

I'd recommend one of those compression gauges with the detachable
hose/gauge so that you can screw the hose in and then connect the
gauge. Much easier than the compression gauges that are one piece -
those are a pain to screw in. I've never tried the ones with just the
rubber that you have to hold into the spark plug hole. I'm sure others
have their own recommendations....

Some more info on your vehicle would certainly assist those expert
troubleshooters out there.
