Subject: Re:shock fitment problems

I recently had a problem with the front shocks on my 66 also from AZ.It seems that the rubber bushing (lower) small, and the shocks both hopped over the nuts.I took them back, and the pair they gave me worked great. If the steel sleeve is too long, it is the wrong piece putin mistakenly.I have put used shocks with this problem on before( which is obviously why I couldn't exchange them) and I have ground the steel sleeve down on the bench grinder which is much easier than pulling the existying one out. I tried using wd-40 once, and it swelled the rubber so much that I wasn't able to get the new one in.  Ed
