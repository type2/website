Subject: leaky exhaust/head connection

Hey folks...

I finally got my muffler today, so I ripped off my &quot;custom type4
exhaust  made of type1 parts&quot;(TM) (and good riddance!) and put on the
heat exchangers I got from Barry Mercer (Thanks dude!) and my new
muffler.

got it funnning and it sound worse than before... damn... the connection
to the muffler is good, so it has to be between the heaters and the
head. I put in new copper gaskets, so it should be sealing good... I
tightened em good, and they seemed to fit good and snug... I don't know
how i screwed this up, but I'll be ripping it off tomorrow to see what's
going on... 

Has anyone else out ther succesfully put 72-74 heaters on a 75-78? I can
only think that something must not be on the right angle or something
and I'm gonna have to grind some metal off... or weld some on... please
no...

If anyone has done this suscessfully, let me know please...

Thanks,
Jeff
