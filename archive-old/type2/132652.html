Subject: Bringing the Bus home.

Hi all,

Well, I made it back to Savannah with the bus. We're all in one piece.
We left on Tuesday from Savannah and made it up to Lawrenceville
Tuesday night. We picked up the bus Wednesday morning and took her over
to Volks Tech. There they gave her an oil change, adjusted the valves
and a once over. He gave her a clean bill of health (for now) and we
were on our way. The guys at Volks Tech gave me a detailed list on what
to fix, which is good. Now I can go to a mechanic with some idea of
what she needs. The biggest problem with the bus is that the person who
put the new engine in it a couple years ago removed the internal fan
and put an external fan in the engine compartment. Steve from Volks
Tech said that was really dumb because the compartment is closed up and
the engine really needs that internal fan. He said the set up would be
fine if it was a dune buggy but of course it's a bus and not a dune
buggy. So because of that we had to let her cool down every couple
hours. Which was fine, we drove 100-140 miles and then let her sit
between 30-60 minutes. Otherwise it ran great, going about 60 mph most
of the way and got between 18.5 - 19.5 miles to the gallon. The person
I purchased the bus was very nice and loaded up the bus with all kinds
of additional parts and books he's accrued over the last couple years.
It's going to take a lot of work to get her in tip top shape, but it
will be fun.

Thanks for all the help over the last couple weeks. I will be asking
lots more questions once I get started cleaning her up.


Thanks again,


Blake Coglianese
