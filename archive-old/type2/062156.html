Subject: Strange camper tops

I saw an unusual camper in passing the other day. It was a '70s era
(rectangular taillights) bus with a top like a westy, only not quite as
tall and one piece from front to back. It had a more pronounced
slant/angle up front. Rather nice looking, though I was going under an
overpass as it crossed over and I didn't get a good enough look at it. No
idea what the interior looked like. This was 30 miles west of Memphis, TN. 
Never seen anything like it, but it looked way too nice to be a hack job.
