Subject: Disc brake problems

 Hello all, I'm hoping someone can help with an aggravating problem that has 
me stumped. Last year I converted my 70 Westy to disc brakes by swapping in a 
beam from a 73. I replaced the master cylinder (Varga) and rubber lines but 
didn't rebuild the calipers. I did take one apart to see if the piston was 
sticking but it was rust and gunk free. At this time I do not have the power 
booster hooked up to vacuum but there are hoses on it to reduce the 
possibility of wind under the bus causing a vacuum and engaing the booster.

 Here's the problem; ever since I did the swap, after I drive the bus for 
about 5 miles or so the front brakes start to drag, eventually they will lock 
up if I don't stop and crack open a bleeder. Once I release the pressure from 
either side, the brakes back off and  I can continue, starting  the cycle all 
over again. I replaced the original brake lever with one from a 71 since the 
arm is just different enough to make it difficult to achieve the proper 
amount of freeplay at the master. 

 I seem to recall another lister mentioning that if you can get the brakes to 
release just by opening a bleeder then it must be the brake lines. The units 
I installed are nice new German pieces that I bought at BFY. Is it possible 
that they are bad? I am on my second Varga master, what are the chances a new 
ATE unit would fix this problem? When the brakes start to drag there is no 
freeplay at the pedal, once I release the pressure, they work normal.  I did 
a similar swap about 12 years ago and had no problems, but I'm m pretty sure 
I did
