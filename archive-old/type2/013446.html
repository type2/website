Thought I would fill you in to my recent problems since I had brought
them to the group originally.

Joe from BUStedVW sent me an email saying they had the pulleys.  He
also sent me an email explaining a problem he had had with the belt
and suggested making sure it was the right one.  Since I had screwed
up my original belt with it falling off I had planned on trying the
old pulley one more time with a new belt.  Well, I installed the old
pulley and the new belt and started the engine.  Ran back to take a
look and the pulley had no wobble and was looking good.  I revved up
the engine and everything was still looking good.  Took it for a 20
mile test drive with no problems.  I am one happy driver again.  Not
sure how the wobble got out of the pulley, I'm thinking the last time
I pried it off to take it to the alternator rebuild place that I pried
at the right spot and it straigthen out.  

Anyway, thanks for the the help from everyone that contributed.
Kevin
