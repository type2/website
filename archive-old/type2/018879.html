&gt; Any chance of one of you having one 1974 (big valve) 1800 head you could part
&gt; with?
&gt; You can tell its a 74 by the presence of air injection ports in the exhaust
&gt; ports and the 41mm intake valve.
&gt; 
&gt; Only requirements are:
&gt; 
&gt; -not cracked (you would have cleaned it and checked)
&gt; 
&gt; -no sunken seats
&gt; 
&gt; I would prefer that it not have been flycut, but if i can't get a stock deck
&gt; height thats okay.
&gt; 
&gt; I may also m be interested in an FI head. I don't think  a 2mm difference in
&gt; intake valve size on one side of the engine would cause catastrophic failure -
&gt; actually, that is a question:
&gt; 
&gt; What would be the ramifications of using a big-valved, carb head on one side
&gt; and a small-valved FI head on the other side, provided all other dimensions
&gt; are identical?
&gt; C'mon you MEs - think back to your days at the 'test engine'...
&gt; 
&gt; Would i lop down the road at a tilt, my bus thinking &quot;i should've had a V8..&quot;
&gt; ? That is a joke.
&gt; 
&gt; You can keep the valves and rocker assembly and stripped/broken/stuck studs
&gt; are not a problem.
&gt; 
&gt; I do have sources for rebuilt/new heads but i'm a big fan of flea markets and
&gt; obslete psrts searches so i figured i'd try this first.
&gt; 
&gt; If you have one you can stand to part with, quote me a price. I'm sure you can
&gt; beat the fellas in the glossy magazines
&gt; &quot;with the cirles and arrows and the paragraph on the back of each one
&gt; explainin' what each one was to be used as evidence against us.&quot;
&gt; Who knows that quote? ;]
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for your help,

I loved that song, and a lot of others, too, (&quot;What! Me, working for
you?&quot; and &quot;looking for clues at the scene of the crime&quot; being two more
favorite lines.
What's wrong with your other head? I'd try to fix it. good shops can put
in a new seat or weld up a ruined combustion chamber. What's a GOOD
shop? Good question, I'm trying to figure that one out myself, maybe
Boston Engine?
Incidentally, a 75 head would have the same valve and spigot sizes, but
no smog pump holes, and not sodium -cooled valves, but it's about the
best starting point if you can't find a 74.
