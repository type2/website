Subject: TDC Marker/Ignition Timing Sensor

The Bentley wiring diagram shows an ignition timing sensor for '72 and a
TDC marker for subsequent year models. This apparently interfaces with the
test plug, providing timing information. I was wondering if anyone knows
what these look like (part # maybe). 

Also, it seems that there might be a way to use this test plug circuitry to
help in timing and many other diagnostics tests. On my old '71 I used to
rob power from the test plug, but that was about it. I'd be curious (since
it's Friday) to hear what others have done along these lines.

Thanks! Joe
