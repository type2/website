Subject: Re: relays v switches

Thanx Cliff for the excellent primer on relays.
	I'd just like to add that using a relay instead of a BIGGER 
SWITCH is sometimes a choice the mfr has taken in one direction but 
it could have been reasonable to go the other way.
	The first car my family owned when I was young was a '26 
Vauxhall  -  from before GM took over that fine brand - a fairly 
large if low-CR 6.  The starter presumably drew a hundred or so amps, 
and quite likely more than a modern smallish 4, say for example a 
Bay.  All else being equal, that current was double because the 
battery was 6 V not 12 V.
	The starter was triggered by a step-on switch on the floor, 
ca. 3 cm across, a ring of springy brass contacts rather like a 
partly-opened daisy pushed to make a LARGE AREA OF CONTACT with a 
convex springy knob.  There was no radio for me to appraise 
RF-generation by the sparks, but it was a long-lived switch carrying 
a hundred or so amps still working fine after 3 decades.
	My point is that, at least in emergency when a relay is 
unavailable, a large-contact switch may do OK.  The other loads on 
the bus are far smaller  -  &lt;10 A I believe  -  and could therefore 
be controlled without a relay if necessary for some reason, given a 
man-size switch.
	All the warnings apply  -  don't explode gases from battery 
etc  -  but it is worth knowing.
