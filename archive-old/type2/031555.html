&gt; What's the difference in the engines with the Dipstick on top of the engine
&gt; has compared to the dipstick out the backside (sort of)?  I bought a 72 Bus
&gt; for the Type 4 motor and the guy who helped me pull it said it was a type2
&gt; motor with 1700 head from a fuel injected vehicle in the past and converted
&gt; to carbs.  He also stated it had type 4 tin.  On top of the cooling housing
&gt; it has a screw on plug to set to take off and look into to check timing.
&gt; What's the difference?

sounds more like a 411 engine, out of a sedan most likely.

they were the type 4 and it was the original fuel injected VW
engine. started out as a 1700 in 71-72.

I ran one in my bus for a while as a spare engine while I worked on my 2
liter,  the sedan had a oil dip stick on top and since you couldn't get to
the back of the motor there was this little screw in &quot;Thingie&quot; on top
of the fan housing so you could see the timing mark
