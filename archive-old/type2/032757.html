Subject: Re: Source for fabric? (Westy curtain butterscotch plaid)

I too would really like to find a source for the original type curtains
for a late 60's to early 70's bus.  From what I hear this fabric is in
fairly high demand.  Is there any chance that some big bus parts
distributor might be willing to have some of the fabric custom made?  
(Bus Depot, Bus Boys, PLF- are you out there - what about it?)

I, for one, would probably be willing to prepay for my share of the order
prior to manufacture.  How about anyone else?
