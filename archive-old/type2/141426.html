Subject: RE: [T2] Engine seal.

&gt; A word of warning:
&gt; 
&gt; Don't but the engine lid seal from cip1_dot_com. It comes in 4 
&gt; bits and is the wrong shape and barely grips the metal. The 
&gt; irony is that I ave just read ratewells article and it says I 
&gt; should but one from JustKampers which is UK based !! 
&gt; (I am in the UK .....)


For those who live stateside, the engine lid seal we sell is the Just
Kampers one.
