Subject: Re: [T2] Pertronix installation help

Jason,

Try the easiest thing first....   Wrong rotor?????
Non oem distributor???...evil PO put different dist in?

I believe that the 1847v is the exact same Pertronix that I installed
in my stock 78 distributor.

I was probably using a 009 rotor in it though...

Going back and looking at the pics, I still don't think the sleeve
is down far enough.

Measure the sleeve and then measure from the bottom of where the sleeve 
will install upwards....mark it with a magic marker or something.

Push rotor on...does it cover up the mark after it is on?..then
something is definitely not right...triple check dist number 
and check for correct rotor.

Just went and looked and Ronnies page 
http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com/ignition.htm#B7576M
says rotor should be 

 Rotor: 04 033

His page also shows that my dist uses the exact same cap
and rotor as your distributor....I have the spacer plate installed.

I can't decide it that is what you have or not....

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hey folks...
&gt; 
&gt; I'm having trouble with the Pertronix Ignitor that my wife gave me as a 
&gt; Christmas gift, and am hoping that someone here can help me out.
&gt; 
&gt; For background, I have the following distributor on my '76 FI:
&gt; 
&gt; 	Bosch 0 231 181 012
&gt; 	VW    022 905 205 AB
&gt; 
&gt; The rotor that is installed is Bosch and marked 1234 33 2215 R5 (1 234 
&gt; 332 215 R5 using the standard Bosch number grouping).
&gt; 
&gt; The Pertronix kit I have is 1847V, the model for vacuum advance VW 
&gt; distributors.
&gt; 
&gt; The issue is basically: the sleeve does not seem to go far enough down 
&gt; the shaft to allow the rotor to fit.  In fact, it does not go down far 
&gt; enough to even line up with the sensor.  The kit includes a spacer 
&gt; plate which can be used to increase the height of the sensor, and 
&gt; installing it makes it line up with the sleeve.  But that still leaves 
&gt; me with a rotor problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Here are some photos that show the problem:

&gt; It really almost seems as if the point cam is just too tall.
&gt; 
&lt;snip&gt;&gt; 
&gt; Thanks, folks...
