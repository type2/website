Subject: Re: [T2] Torquing Heads



&gt; Well, he called me back about 15 minutes later and
&gt; says that he just talked to the engine rebuilder
&gt; he got the engine from, who said something along the
&gt; lines of &quot;the heads that are on that engine are Aluminum
&gt; and shouldn't need to be torqued&quot;, in addition to that,
&gt; they are apparently torqued to 28 ft. lbs (as opposed
&gt; to the spec 22-23 ft. lbs specified by Bentley).

Maybe he is using that 'rolling' torque spec that came up on the list a week or
so ago........[or whatever name was given to compensate for friction or
whatever]
