&gt; &quot;Why do some VW hoses have a braided covering?&quot;..
&gt; Here it is. When you, or something else,
&gt; applies a pull to that hose, the braided covering locks it down, just like one
&gt; of those old &quot;Chinese finger trap&quot; puzzles. How about that? The hoses push on
&gt; easy, but resist being pulled off! Simple, and ingenious!

Interesting theory, but I'm not sure if the braid has that much effect with
thick walled hose.  Hoses tend to stick after a while anyway, so that you
need to give them a twist before pulling them off (you can feel it 'give'
when you turn it).

I think the main reason not to use clamps is because it's just not necessary
if the hose is not under pressure (or is under vacuum).

Just my two small units of currency worth.
