Subject: Re: [T2] What's your MPG

Air resistance is proportional to the square of your 
&gt; velocity so by going at 80 rather than 60 you almost double your air 
&gt; resistance! 

This is true, things really change at 60, I have been going to Bonneville Speedweek for over a decade now and you constantly hear &quot;remember it takes twice the horsepower to go 80 as it does to go 60&quot;

The resistance curve dramatically turns and points straight up between 60 and 80, there is also something weird around 188 and 260, but I am not sure that relates to our busses, but it is almost Friday, 17 more minutes.
