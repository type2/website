Subject: Re: [T2] Luggage rack holes

Hi Volks!

&gt; I finally climbed up on top of our new-to-us 84 Westy to see how the
&gt; luggage rack &quot;works.&quot; I found five 1/2'' diameter holes in the recess,
&gt; one in each corner and one center-front. This can't be right --
&gt; rainwater will pool in the luggage rack recess and drain right above the
&gt; headliner above the front seats I reckon. Or am I mistaken? -- are those
&gt; deliberate drain holes with secret outlets somewhere?

If that's an original Westy luggage rack, don't panic --
there's still an ordinary metal Bus roof underneath,
which isn't especially prone to leaking.  The holes are
needed to avoid collecting a puddle of water in the recess
which would serve to bathe your luggage as well as provide
surprising showers to adjacent traffic when cornering or
braking after rainy weather.

Airhowlingly yours,
