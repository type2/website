Hi volks,
               Prompted by a long discourse in a UK 911 publication and the recent discussions of engine replacement in the UK I have done a bit more digging on the topic of the phasing out of four star and its implications for us.

 I notice that the various VW parts places in VolksWorld are pushing &quot;unleaded&quot; heads for upright engines at the moment but not for pancakes.
 
 I 'phoned VolkSpares and they said that my &quot;CJ&quot; code 2.0l engine from '77 would
 be OK on unleaded but that earlier ones might not be. I didn't manage to pin down when he thought the changeover might be.
 
 I 'phoned Just Kampers- the guy there was very helpful (if you're reading this- thanks a lot! :-) and said that there is no difference between the UK-spec pancake heads and the US-spec ones, that VW confirm that this is the case but that they are NOT prepared to certify that this means UK transporters will be OK on un
leaded.
 Effectively the VW line seems to be that there is no reason that pancakes shouldn't run on unleaded but don't come crying to us if you have problems...

 On the other hand the UK/US upright engines ARE different- the heads have different part numbers and there is some (unspecified) difference between the US heads (unleaded) and the UK ones (leaded). He wasn't sure what this difference was, exactly, but it appears that it would be worth changing heads to the US spec ones at some point if you have an upright engine (planning to pull your enginet in the next 18 months? Add US heads to your shopping list...!).
 I assume that running the UK spec heads on unleaded until they fail would be risky, since a valve failure could cause serious engine damage beyond simply replacing the failed heads, however there are two gems from the Porschefolks:

 Bruce Anderson (well known in Porsche circles as a technical expert) reports running hardness tests on early aircooled Porsche heads (356 (upright), 911 and 914 (pancake)) which indicate that none of them should experience any problems using unleaded. Obviously these heads are different from the VW ones but you may, like me, feel the tests are relevent.

 The editorial claims that &quot;...your engine is unlikely to suffer disastrous failure purely as a result of using unleaded petrol. In fact, the most obvious effect will be a gradual loss of cylinder compression. The valve clearances will also tend to close up (further excacerbating the loss of compression), the engine will probably become difficult to start, and eventually it will begin to lose power.&quot; and goes on to point out that any deterioration will be mileage related and make take a considerable amount of time to become problematic on a low mileage vehicle.

 Once again this is aimed at Porsche owners rather than VW ones but it seems to me that the message is pertinent.

 The Porsche article is in this months &quot;911 and Porsche World&quot; magazine, if anyone wants more detail. It doesn't have a compatibility chart or anything but does point out that your options will be somewhat limited in a year or so, so you might as well make the best of them...

 Hope this is useful. As an aside, I wonder how many UK listees have uprights and how many have pancakes?

Cheers,
              W.
