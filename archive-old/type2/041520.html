Subject: new bus owner &amp; long trip preparation...

Hola,

ok, so im new to owning a bus. I sold the '65 beetle, and bought myself
a 1975 bus. I just dropped all new CV joints, EGR canister, and an 
assortment of little hoses and wires that needed replacing, and it seems to 
be running well.

Im going on a trip mid-august and want to make sure i take any precausions i 
can to minimize my chances of having a situation im not ready for.

the first small thing id like to do is add a cot to the back area like in a 
camper style bus my same year but i cant quite figure out how its in there. 
the way back area would be the 1st section of the bed, and the folded down 
seat the second, but what do you have holding up the third section in a 
camper? is there something else that folds out, or is there a way for me to 
make something for the third section to rest on so I can sleep on the road?

outside of that, any suggestions as to weather or not I should try adding a 
temp guage so I can monitor that, or any hardware or supplies i should plan 
on bringing with to help me along.

Ill be travelling from San Francisco to Seattle for the Twin Peaks Festival 
they hold up there in august so i still have time to get my bus up to snuff.
