Subject: Re: [T2] Possum

Possum sounds like a great name for your bus.
It's cute and bound to keep you up at night.
Your girlfriend will get over it:-)
All of my buses have names, despite the fact that 2
out of 3 of them don't even run.
Buses NEED names and I can't think of a better one for
yours.
:-)
Cheers

&gt; Seeing all these busses with names on the list I
&gt; started thinking about one
&gt; for mine. I wasn't having much luck until last
&gt; night. I worked late and got
&gt; my case assembled, all glued and torqued up. I drove
&gt; home from the shop and
&gt; when I got in my girlfriend was already in bed. She
&gt; had left the back door
&gt; open just a little so our cats could go out to the
&gt; back yard. (a 20 x 12
&gt; foot fenced in patio) We live in a townhome in
&gt; Arlington, VA. I closed the
&gt; door and went to bed... Around 3:00 am we both heard
&gt; noises downstairs,
&gt; maybe a mouse, zzzz, louder noises... I get out of
&gt; bed to go and see, go
&gt; downstairs naked, and there sitting in my living
&gt; room is an enormous
&gt; possum. I open the door and try to shoe him out into
&gt; the cold and all he
&gt; does is hiss at me. I try to move him with a broom
&gt; and he just gets madder.
&gt; Then he charges at me and my freaked out girlfriend
&gt; and runs between our
&gt; legs and up the stairs towards the bedroom. Its now
&gt; almost 4:00am and we
&gt; both have to work in the morning. I go upstairs and
&gt; find our friend in the
&gt; office room, I shut the door and locked him in. I
&gt; call animal control and
&gt; they won't come till 6:00am. Try to sleep for 2 hrs
&gt; as the sucker is just
&gt; trashing my office. Finally the animal control women
&gt; shows up, she says aww
&gt; he's just a little one, grabs him by the tail and
&gt; walks out of my house
&gt; carrying the sucker by his tail. My girl doesn't
&gt; think we should name the
&gt; bus Possum but I'm thinkin I'll at least call the
&gt; engine that. Any
&gt; thoughts?
