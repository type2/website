Subject: Hard to get in to Reverse

I replaced the transmission of my '72 with a '78 (now the engine and the
transmission are from the same year.

I had to change the length of the linkage to allow me to shift to second and
fourth. However, I am still having trouble getting in to reverse (once it
gets there it is fine).  Are there any adjustments for the &quot;pushing down&quot;
part of reverse or any other adjustments that may help me get it in to
reverse easier?


Thanks
