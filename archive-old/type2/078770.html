Chris Mills says about random-orbit sanders:

&gt; I bought one for woodworking and it really cuts the material down fast.
&gt; MUCH faster than my old Black and Decker Professional (read  pre-DeWalt)
&gt; square pad sander. You can buy these too at the same place but they sand
&gt; much slower.
&gt; 
&gt; Mine is a Porter-Cable. As good as the good air tools.

Let me add something to Chris' post. A random-orbit sander (or sandah, if
you watch The New Yankee Workshop) uses round sandpaper with Velcro on the
back and holes in it for the sawdust to go through to the dust-collection
can. Porter-Cable makes two models of these sanders, the 333 and the 333VS.
There are three differences between the two: the VS is more expensive, the
VS is variable speed, and the VS can use either five-hole or eight-hole
paper whereas the regular 333 can use only five-hole. A non-VS 333 owner
will soon learn that Porter-Cable seems to be the only company that uses
five-hole paper; you can get eight-hole everywhere from pro tool places to
Wal-Mart while five-hole is a bit harder to come by.

Moral of this story: The Porter-Cable 333VS is the best random-orbit sandah
on the market.
