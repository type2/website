Subject: What is the motor in a 1975 Microbus?

------_=_NextPart_001_01C1A45B.632FF0F0
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;


Looking at purchasing another bay, and have found an add
in local paper for a 1975 Microbus for NZ$2100 (US$850-ish ?)

Anyway, before I go traveling across the town to look at it
I was wondering if someone could tell me what kind of motor
was in these models, I'm presuming it's a Type IV motor, but
have no idea of capacity, or whether it's EFI or Carb....?

Thanks in Adv.

Cheers
Lloyd
