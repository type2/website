Very cool trailer!

I was left a card just last weekend by this production, asking to photograph 
my bus. Amazing what a coat of wax will do!! I can't seem to find the card, 
but I recall that they were asking for submissions a while back. Does anyone 
have the contact info?

We're leaving Long Beach for good in 2 weeks!
