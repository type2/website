Subject: Re: [T2] Towing a westfalia

steve,

i live in allentown pa, i bought my westy from a guy
in cheasepeke va. in my experience towing is a VERY
expensive venture. i couldnt find anyone who would
move it from VA to PA for less than 600. my advice to
you is that you fly or take the bus (like me) to the
vehicle, and then drive it back to your area. thats
what i did, it was much cheaper, plus you get an
adventure out of it. this method also allows you to
inspect the vehicle in person before buying it. 

Matty
76 Westy &quot;Cleopatra&quot;
