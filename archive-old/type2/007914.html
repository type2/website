&gt;Still working on &quot;The list&quot; of major VW oriented salvageyards in North 
&gt;America
&gt;(while searching for my high roof of course!) Have received a surprisingly 
&gt;low
&gt;number of responses from our California folks. It seems to me that there are
&gt;ten times as many VW's on the road throughout California than most other
&gt;states. AND, since this is where most of the aftermarket camper conversions
&gt;were done, naturally my search has led me there. I'm hoping that somewhere 
&gt;out
&gt;there it exists, so please E-me directly w/ the name, # , whatever you 
&gt;have so
&gt;I can call them up &amp; also add them to my list. I will post the results very
&gt;soon for all those interested... 

     You know, my experience (5 yrs in LA) was that there really aren't 
much in the way of specialized yards, at least in LA. Why? Because 
there's so damned many bugs and busses running around that the regular 
ol' salvage yards have 'em. Seems like it might not be cost effective to 
specialize when all the local yards will beat your prices. Dunno if 
that's why there's no specialized yards or not, but it could be.


Peace,
