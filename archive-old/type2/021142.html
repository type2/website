Well I finally finished my conversion on my 74 Westy.  It wasn't easy
but it works.  The shifting isn't as smooth as I would have liked but I
am still making adjustments.  Thanks to all for help and if anyone is
thinking about doing this drop me a line.  Also I have a 74 auto tranny
that needs some work if anyone wants it come and get it I am in MD.

Frankie
