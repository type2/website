One of the first bug engines I built had similar problems.  It seemed to be
dragging, had a hard time idling, and wouldn't get up to speed.  About 15
minutes down the road the whole rear end locked up on me.  That was a crazy
ride.  I learned about end-play that day, and what happens when you don't
set it correctly.  I welded the main bearing to the crank shaft.
I hope this isn't your problem.

&gt; While trying to take the maiden voyage today I had some trouble.   I
&gt; could never get over 20mph.  Severe drag somewhere.  I had to feather
&gt; the clutch just to get that fast.  I thought stuck brake.  All the
&gt; wheels spin by hand.
