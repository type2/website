Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] so we got in the red vw microbus, and headed toward
 the police officer station!


In roughly 10 years of bus motoring, I have been pulled over once, by a
rookie deputy who didn't know how to properly enter an amateur radio plate
into his car's computer.  It came up &quot;not found&quot; which in the cop's mind
means &quot;bogus&quot;.  I showed him how to properly enter the plate number with a
space in the middle (&quot;N7 TNK&quot; versus &quot;N7TNK&quot;) and we talked buses for a
bit until he had to go investigate a domestic disurbance.

I have a standard '71 station wagon, original paint, lots of antennas, and
the only sticker is for the Disaster Communications Service, a Sheriff's volunteer
group.  My bus carries more of geek aura than a hippie aura!  :)
