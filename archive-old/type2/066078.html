Subject: Value of 36hp engine?

I have in my possession one 36 horse engine.  #3107555, which puts it 
December 1959, by Muir.  This, again if Muir is correct, would have 
been in the last run of 36hp engines.  It is whole.  It has been 
sitting outside for sometime.  It is basically covered with surface 
rust.  All of the tin is present but the front piece is bent.  It 
turns slowly by hand.  I was only grabbing the flywheel and quit when 
it gave resistance so I wouldn't cut myself.  I would think some 
things of value on the engine would be the air cleaner, tin, intake 
manifold, ?.  I really know nothing of these engines.  By complete I 
mean it looks like it was running when pulled.  It still has the 
generator, carburetor (28PCI)...  It does have 
the little round piece near the fan intake, I was told these are hard 
to find.  Anyway, I was about to give the thing away when it struck me
that it might be worth something.  Anyone?  Thanks, Jim
