Subject: RE: head bolts

Well. . . Yeah I do something like that too but I consider that 'only once'.
I think the manual says to do the first series to 7ft/lbs. Of course
multiple stages won't hurt.

&gt; Only once? A lot of folks like to put the heads on, put on 
&gt; the head nuts, then torque in stages. Take it to 10 lb-ft, 
&gt; let it sit for 20 minutes or so, go to 15 lb-ft, let sit for 
&gt; 20 minutes, go to final torque, let sit for 20 minutes, then 
&gt; check the torque on the head nuts one final time and leave 
&gt; it. This gives the engine time to accept the fact that it's 
&gt; going to have heads on it whether it likes them or not.
