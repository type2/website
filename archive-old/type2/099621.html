Subject: Re: [T2] Carb Suggestion and head for 2.0 79 Bus

One problem: carb icing in the winter.

If you go with a carb, send me the fuel injected pieces. I'll put them to use.

&gt;I am in the process of rebuilding my 79 2.0 Fuel Injected engine. I am not
&gt;going to put the fuel injection back on as of now and was wondering what
&gt;your guys suggestions on getting a carb would be? duals or a single? I had a
&gt;progressive on a bus a couple years back on a 74 and it performed great and
&gt;was reliable. I wouldn9t mind having another but would this be too
&gt;underpowered for a 2.0. What about duals are they worth it. I want this bus
&gt;to be reliable and easy to service. I don9t want to be adjusting every
&gt;couple weeks but I also want to use the power of a 2.0. Also I am wanting to
&gt;buy new heads anyone have any suggestions on quality heads and where to get
&gt;them. Price doesn9t matter I just want stock heads or what you guys
&gt;recommend on getting something that will last.
