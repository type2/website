Go with the switch.  I've tried both the isolator set-up and relay 
set-up.  The relay won't work when the battery driving the relay is 
dead, thus effectively eliminating the usefullness of the device (had 
to use jumpers between batteries to get relay to work).  
Isolators still have a drain problem and a charging problem.  After 
the primary battery is charged the system quits charging and won't 
fully charge the secondary.

Geta a switch.  A or B battery or both.  I also bought an Amp meter, 
so I can check on the battery condition.  Only problem is that I never 
hooked this stuff up.  The Amp Meter needs to be REALLY close to the 
alternator to work.  Great for front engines but . . .  Haven't found 
a good location for the switch, that sucker is BIG.  Haven't found an 
acceptable location for the secondary battery(s).  '80 westi.  One of 
these days.

&gt; So what's the deal as you understand it Dave? Why is a relay better than an
