&gt;  Hey everybody, I've got a '77 Westie and its getting some water under the
&gt;  carpet just inside the sliding door.  I live just north of Seattle so its
&gt;  only raining 23 1/2 hours a day.  I've checked and its not comeing from
&gt;  above, so I think that its comeing from under the carpet.  I haven't
&gt;  pulled the carpet up yet, but I was thinking that it could be a bolt hole
&gt;  where the middle seat would go on the 9 seater.  Or maybe it could be
&gt;  comeing up from where the propane tank it bolted up?  If any of ya'll have
&gt;  had the same thing happen I would like to hear from ya.  Until then,

Hi  Marcus

Check that the door seal is good.

If the door is not closing tightly then

first	Dig out all the old congealed grease from the top bottom and 
		middle tracks and put fresh in. It accumulates into a brown mass 
		that looks like solid metal. Its amazing how much easier and 
		tighter the door will close
then	if your leak is around the door then adjust the position of the front 
		rollers (top and bottom) to increase the pressure on the rubber.

Remember also that water can travel a distance to emerge at the lowest point
in a puddle far from the point of entry.

Good luck
