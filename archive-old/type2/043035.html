Subject: strange phonecalls at work?

Now here is a new twist. I have one of two choices to make. I found this bay 
window westy (presumably a 730) for $600. I am a poor soul and can barely 
afford that but now I find myself at a crossroads. My friend and owner of 
Bug Acres in Copperas Cove informs me that he has a 66 westy for sale. Now I 
have seen this girl, real pretty barndoor but motor is frozen. Looks like 
morons who owned her before used her for hunting, camo curtains and just 
beat up. What to do. He is asking a pretty penny at $1700 but is it worth 
it. No rust on body and interior is all there. is this the so44?
