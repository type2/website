How about steel brake line?  Thicker walls, but can still be easily bent.
You'll probably have to cut off the flares, which can be done with either
a tubing cutter or a hacksaw (don't forget to smooth the end if you use a
hacksaw!

&gt; 
&gt; .............._dot_can I find steel fuel line?  Now I know that non-VW auto parts 
&gt; stores sell small segments of fuel line which has been set up with flares and 
&gt; hardware.  But what I'm looking for is regular old steel fuel tubing.  About 
&gt; six uninterrupted feet of it.  Absolutely nobody I've talked to (including 
&gt; pipe and tubing suppliers!) has the slightest idea of where to pick up an 
&gt; item like this.  This stuff can't be extinct, can it?
