So Pat Walsh says:
&gt; 
&gt; So now I'm back to being undecided again!  Their Sales Executive is on
&gt; vacation and is supposed to contact me, but in the meantime they sent
&gt; a one-page (front and back) brochure showing two of their models, the
&gt; Compact 1600W and the 2600W, which put out 1600 and 2600 watts of heat,
&gt; respectively.  Could someone give me an idea of how much heat that would
&gt; be?  Chris wrote of the 1600W model (approx. 14&quot;x6&quot;x4&quot;, the 2600 is 14&quot;x
&gt; 5&quot;x8&quot;) being entirely adequate even for Alaska, but this MUST be a
&gt; different scale or measurement than, for example, a 1500W hair dryer
&gt; (which I doubt would do much to heat my bus).  How much would 1600 watts
&gt; be in BTUs?  How many BTUs does the BN4 put out?  Other specs. (FYI) are
&gt; as follows:

I've one of these puppies on order and just got the visa bill (gulp!) $570.00
Ouch!  Oh well, on those cold nights (or days) I'm sure I'll appreciate it.
Anyone wanting to stay in my camper while it's cold out is going to get 
charged a $20 entrance fee.  ;)  I talked with Chris and he said that it 
was quite comfortable and heated the van up fairly quickly.  He said to 
be sure to order the 1/4 inch copper pipe size conversion as well as the 
mushroom shaped flues for the exhaust/inlets for the burner or you might 
get snow/dirt in the pipes.   I believe that somewhere in the flyer that
it says it puts out 5000 BTUs.
