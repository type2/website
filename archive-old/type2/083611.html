Subject: Re: [T2] way too injected!

He mentioned that if he disconnected the ecu and left it, it would run for
a time. I am thinking its time to try another ecu before spending a lot
more effort on it.
no?



&gt; hmmm, you seem to have a winner here,  I would check (and you may have)
&gt;
&gt; .  presure regulator could be set too high or malfunctioning
&gt; .  restriction in the return fuel line back to the tank
&gt; .  sticking injectors (staying open)
&gt;
&gt; I would remove one injector trigger wire at a time to maybe pinpoint the
&gt; cyl that is putting out too much gas.
&gt;
&gt; .  intake valve staying open too long (not likely)
&gt;
