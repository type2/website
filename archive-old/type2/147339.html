Hi Volks!

I agree.  This supports my theory that until 1973,
Volkswagen's airhowlers were continuously made better
(not necessarily more beautiful, but better), whereas
from 1974 on they were just made cheaper -- presumably
because the waterboilers needed so much money and
constructive attention.

Airhowlingly yours,  
   Erik.
