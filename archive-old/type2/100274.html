Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Oil temp sender in sump plate (was &quot;Snake oil or
  real product&quot;)

Thanks for the info, Mark. Not sure where you mean by &quot;face&quot; of the block 
... clarify if you can. I have been happy with the oil temp sender in the 
sump plate (where it almost *requires* screen removal) but I think it's 
affected by ambient temperature for quite a while until the engine warms up 
(up here in the Rockies in winter, that means at least 40-50 miles). That 
is, the air streaming around it cools the metal which cools the sender 
somewhat. But in the summer that's less significant. I think the most 
important thing is to put the sender where oil will be forced to circulate 
around it, which is almost anywhere in the sump or oiling chain. I've always 
thought it interesting that we measure our oil *before* it goes through the 
cooler (an in-sump or pressure-switch-area sender), when a post-cooler 
temperature would be much more relevant.

&gt;hello Mick   I have one of the temp senders mounted in the relief  ports. 
&gt;It
&gt;tends to read high. The best place to mount the sender is directly in the
&gt;face of the block, this is where all the Formula Vees mount theirs. If you
&gt;get a chance read my input on the pick-up screens. later and have fun  Mark
