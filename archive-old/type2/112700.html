Subject: the &quot;Frankenbus&quot; (a shameless Westies in the Woods plug)

Speaking of beefed up busses, Have you seen Tim's &quot;Frankenbus&quot; famous
from Everybus to  NJ's Westies in the Woods?  It's a Toyota van
base/rear/engine with a Splittie literally grafted to the top via rivets
and epoxy!  The VW logo has been replaced with a large office clock that
spins backwards. For you &quot;never go north&quot; easterners, (especially the
Washington folks)  how about driving to Westies in the Woods this next
Fri, to a very scenic camping area by the Appalachian trail in Stokes
State Forest, at the top of NJ, and then you can meet Tim, as well as
Jon Kleckner, an ex VW/Porsche mechanic who can tell the condition of
your engine without a compression test. (And so old-fashioned he still
has no Computer!)
