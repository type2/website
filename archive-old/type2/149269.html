Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Hubcaps

larry
Thanks for the link.  It was most helpful.
it looks like we have 2 x Bug hubcaps &amp; 2 x type 3 caps??  if I
read the article correctly.
Anyway will have a site up shortly as I want to list a collection of
photos of the bus as we are having it resprayed as i write.
The colours will be cream on top with a blue below.  The painter has
taken the liberty of spraying the gas bottle door cream ( as most  
campers
seem to have here in Australia) &amp; also the front cold air intake to  
&quot;break&quot;
blue a little.
He is also painting the bullbar cream plus the bumper bars with new  
paint
for the wheel rims.
hope to show it off soon!!!

&gt; You probably have a couple of the ones detailed in this article:

&gt; story=20030316134838162&amp;query=hubcaps&gt;
&gt; They are correct for '66 &amp; '67 Type 3s and '67 Type 1 Ghias (with 4  
&gt; lug
&gt; wheels and disc brakes). They are heavier than the '68 &amp; later ones  
&gt; and,
&gt; in my opinion, better looking.
