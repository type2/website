Dear All,

My 71 1600 DP is stuttering/hesitating under load while accelerating.  It
is a half second of nothing and then back to normal.  These are spaced
rather erratically but are not present in the first two gears.

30 and 40 mph are the favorite spots and she will currently not go over 46
mph...  The symptoms started a week or so ago but were maybe one or two
pops a trip.  Now they are everywhere.  

So far I have adjusted my valves, checked my plugs and timing, replaced my
wires, tried 2 distributors, replaced Pertronix with points, switched from
the CDI module and back, replaced the coil, replaced the fuel pump, been
through the relatively new carburetor cleaning and checking the accelerator
and float level, replaced the fuel filter, checked for air leaks and all
manifold junctions, fished for rust chunks in my fuel tank with a magnet.
All of these have done nothing.  Not a change.

If anyone has seen this before or has any other ideas as to what the
problem may be please let me know...  I am trying desperately to get to
North Carolina and may find an alternate mode of transport:( so if I am
slow in response please don't think that I am rude.

Frustrated and tired,

Brian Allen
