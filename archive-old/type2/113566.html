&gt;this is not a proposal to do sub-par work and walk away from ones own
&gt;mistakes but, a suggestion about how an individual could start a side
&gt;business with out as much of the overhead as previously recommended.

 From the get go he needs the bucks to hire the lawyer to set up the corp. 
My suggestions were premised on the idea that if you don't plan for profit 
by reducing the common risks to small business, you allow failure to take 
it's natural course. A side biz on the cuff to bankruptcy is another way to 
go. Some use this tech every 7 years to absolve debts over and over 
throughout their lives as SOP. Run up the bill and bleed the creditors and 
protect the money gotten no matter how. It is a way to make a living. It 
has nothing whatever to do with earning a living and a good reputation for 
PROPER business practices.
