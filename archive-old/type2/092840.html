Subject: RE: [T2] Battery Isolator Problem


&gt;That's basically the same as the Hella Dual Battery Kit I sell for $18.95
&gt;(part # 1738).  It's a kit consisting of an appropriately rated relay (with
&gt;integrated fuse and holder), wiring, and instructions.  Pretty much the same
&gt;setup that was used on Westfalia campers that were factory equipped with
&gt;dual batteries.  Simple yet effective.

Or visit your local RV or local Marine (boat) supplier if you got to have 
one RIGHT NOW.

Ron's price is probably just right.


Ciao!
