Let me put in a plug here for the TorqueMeister.  I know it's $130, but if
you do this job more than once a year, you need this tool.

I bought one and have used it on two engines and two brake jobs in the
last six months.  Well worth the money.

Check out this web site for details.

&gt; My question is, how do you know how to re-torque the sucker when you are
&gt; putting it back on?  Hammering the h*ll out of it doesn't show up in any
&gt; of my manuals as a torque setting.
