Chris, Dude,................

I gotta feel for ya there!  I myself have a '71 Campmobile that has been with me
personally for about 16 yrs, and I would be facing very much the same dilemma
when/if this kind of thing happened to &quot;Janis&quot;.

I found in my travels as &quot;The cable guy&quot;, I did find a red '71 Westy/ Campmobile,
that a fellow said a friend almost bought it for $1000.  I have stopped by a
couple of times when passing through the area and have taken a fair look at it
and its in much better shape body wise that my &quot;Janis&quot; is, but my attachment to
her hasn't lead me to consider trying to buy it, yet!  That and I don't have the
money{8&gt;(

I live in Greer, SC which is half way between Greenville &amp; Spartainburg.  If you
want ta swing through the area sometime, camp out somewhere in the area, back
yard even!  Then let me know.  I don't have a lot of extra time these days to
look into it but I will pass on better into if I do have the opportunity to get
any more.  I'll make the time to lead ya to it if ya can stop by some weekend.

To make it more like your loss appearance wise a paint job will have to be
considered, $$$$$ wise it might be taken as an opportunity to restore.  It does
have a # of minor stump and branch type travel scars but like I said better shape
than mine is.

The busma must carry on!
