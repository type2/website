Subject: oil get warmer

after  i tryed sychronise my carburateurs 1977 westy cj 2 liter engine 
,[thanks for the tips david ]and timed the egnision ,  it seems to run ok , 
only the oil which was alway,s a bit low on temperatur and slowly rising, 
warms up much quiker and get warmer , not to warm but atleast 20 degees c 
more , is did a good sign ???, the engine seems to preform better but also 
seems to consume more fuel , the bos consumes more alchohol for sure during 
the lasst 2 days it took me [all beginings are dificult ] and to sychronise 
carburateur for the first time , makes you very very dirsty. greetings co
