There's a couple problems that could bite you real hard. Look at the glass 
in the vent window (top right photo, first link).

Look like US DOT standard labelling? Not hardly. I'll bet we could all get 
through the border with a few replacement pieces of glass but with all the 
new glass questions will lead to questions. Then comes the speedo, then 
comes the lights, then comes etc. etc. etc.

My point is we all use import parts to replace the old US spec stuff but 
when EVERYTHING is labelled imported isn't somebody (border inspectors) 
going to develop an attitude? Maybe get it across the border and then do 
the swapper-roony? Not that I've ever crossed that border and have the 
slightest idea of what it is like. Maybe nobody cares... &lt;grin&gt;
