&gt; So here's what I did today
&gt; I wire brushed the cab floor..
&gt; I applied a coat of the POR product--and when it is dry--I'm laying a
&gt; heavy coat of urethane bed liner in leauof replacing the rubber matt.

Did you use the 'metal ready' prep stuff before painting the POR ?
That (or something similar) helps.

&gt; I will say this---
&gt; After I brushed a coat of this stuff on the flor--the little bit I got
&gt; on my hands and arms ...

DO NOT leave this stuff on your skin - get it off while its still
wet and can be removed.  I've worked with all kinds of paints, 
fiberglass resins, etc over the years, but this stuff is dangerous.
