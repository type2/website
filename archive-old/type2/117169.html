Subject: Re: [T2] Electric Fuel Pump, YES or NO?

i was driving a buddies late 80's ford 1/2 ton truck and hit a HUGE deer in
s.e. Idaho and it tripped the fuel pump switch.  my buddy finally figured
out that was the problem after we discharged the battery and got it charged
back up by a nice sheriff who broke a few department rules for us in doing
so.  anyway, the thing worked like a charm, i just wish i knew about it
before draining the battery.

Ford products such as 80's vintage Tempos and the like came with an impact
switch in the trunk that would kill the fuel pump in the event of a
rollover or a crash. Has a reset switch for the rare occasions that it
trips by mistake.
