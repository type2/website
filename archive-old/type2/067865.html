&gt;If all goes well, I will pick up my first Bus Saturday morning. 

Congrats!

&gt;Some guy offered him $200 dollars more than the price we agreed upon. He 
&gt;still is selling it to me, even though I couldn't afford to match the 
&gt;higher offer.

That's pretty cool. Sounds like this was meant to be your bus!

&gt;The windshield needs replacing. How can I go about finding a replacement?
&gt;Can I just call up a place that replaces windshields and expect them to 
&gt;have what I need?

Your cheapest option is a junkyard.  Bus windshields are the same from 
'68-79, so they're pretty easy to find.  Usually $50-75.  New should be 
about $120ish. If they quote much more than that, shop around.
Also, buy a new windshield gasket.  WCM sells them for $18. Breadloaf buses 
tend to rust out around the windshield gasket because it doesn't make a 
good seal to the body.  If there is any indication of this at all on yours 
(and I'm betting there is), make sure to have the area properly repaired 
(grind down to metal, treat, and fill in the pits) while the windshield is 
out.  You will be unable to affect a permanent repair with the windshield 
in, so this is your chance.  If you let it go, you will eventually have 
small rust pinholes through the body, allowing rain to get in and short out 
the wires in your dash.  When you put in the new windshield (or have it 
installed), use silicone between the gasket and the body to prevent the 
rust from happening again. 
 
&gt;The bus is a camper but it isn't a Westfalia. It has a hard top. I think
&gt;it had cabinets in the back, but I don't know to what extent. It is not a 
&gt;transporter

Yes it is.  Transporter, Type 2 and Station Wagon were the official names 
for the Bus in the U.S.  For that matter, don't assume that it isn't a 
Westfalia just bacause it lacks the poptop.  There were Westfalia 
&quot;weekenders&quot; with no poptops.

Enjoy bus ownership!
