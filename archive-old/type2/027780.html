could anyone give me a overview or point me to a web page that would explain 
installing a cluster of gauges, engine head temp, oil pressure, and oil 
temp. on my 74 westy.  Two years ago I took the gauges off of my 78 parts 
westy and can't remember how the wires run and such.
thanks erling berner.
