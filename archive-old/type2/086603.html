NO head gaskets, perhaps shims, but either way definately not copper.

I have never had a type 4 engine but don't they have copper head gaskets?


&gt;&gt;&gt; I want to buy a 73 VW van. . .

&gt;VW's don't really have gaskets so that isn't it, but if it runs and the
&gt;body is in decent shape it is probably worth $450,  offer them 300 settle
&gt;for something in between
