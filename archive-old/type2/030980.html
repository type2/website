&gt; into the idea of buying an type 2.  First thing I did was went to the library 
&gt; and checked out Muirs, Idiots Guide to Repairing Air Cooled Engines and 
&gt; another Reference book.   Ive come to the conclusion that I would want a 
&gt; 
&gt; 2.  Do any of you prefer a year? Do you discorouge the buying of a particular 
&gt; year? Are any models or years more reliable?

71 and 78/79 seem to be the most reliable.  71 is carbs and about 50
horses, the 78/79 are 2 liter fuel injected with about 67HP  

&gt; 3.  Are VWs good to learn mechanics on?

probably better than most.

&gt; 4.  I know in older trucks you have to either rebuild cylinder heads or fill 
&gt; up with a lead additive. Is this also true with VWs, if so what year are you 
&gt; safe from engines made to be filled up with leaded gas?

&gt;from what I have been told (no flame wars please) the older ones have had
so much lead run through em they will wear out before they need it, or
they have been rebuilt and all the new parts are designed to be ok without
lead.   this is pretty much a non issue unless you find a new one hidden
away in someones barn.

&gt; 5.  Also Ive heard different deals concerning speed.  A book that I was 
&gt; reading said early type 2s hit a top of 60.  But my dad remembered crusing at 
&gt; 70 with his transporter.  This isnt a big issue, however is 60 mph max speed?

the 71 might get 60 down hill with a tail wind  (stock)
the 78 will do 70 on level terrain (stock)

YMMV

&gt; 6. How good are the car stereo?   Can it be easily retrofitted with a new 
&gt; one?  Once again not a biggy.

surely you jest!  people in VW's didn't need anything that fancy in a type
2 according to the muckety mucks in Wolfesburg

&gt; know I probally asked to much, sorry.  Anyways thanks again.

nah, have fun.
