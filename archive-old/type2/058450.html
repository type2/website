Hey all!

Long time no post.  I've long since sold my '67 Rusty and have reentered the Type 2 world with a '77 Westy.

Anyway, I got a great deal on the bus because the PO hit a deer with it.  It crushed the center front of the bus in a good 6 inches.  It missed the bumper and the lip under the window but everything else is crunched.  What I'm wondering is has anyone gotten damage like this fixed before?  Is it worth fixing or should I buy new metal from RMMW or somebody?  I can scavenge parts  off of a 75 bus that this guy has, should I cut the front off of that bus?

Need advice.

TIA,

Bob J.
