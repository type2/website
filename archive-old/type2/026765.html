&gt;&gt; Additionally, the 1776 has a full flow oil filter, incompatible with that 
&gt;rear engine mounting cross member!! 
&gt;&gt;Is there anyway I can make this configuration work?

That 'full-flow' pump is just one option that you have to acquire full-flow...and from what I've heard it's not the best. It's a good option, but not the best.

The other way to get full-flow is to put in a pump with oversized gears and then tap the case in one of the oil passages; those little metal buttons you see all over your engine are caps on these passages. I think to tap the gallery, you remove one of these and then use a tap to thread the gallery. The last Type 1 engine I built was for a '64 bus, which didn't need the rear mount...and I was afraid to take a chance tapping the gallery, so I used the pump like you have. Lots of professionals would think I'm silly to fear tapping a gallery, but they're professionals and I'm not.

Here's the rub. You have to split the case to tap one of the galleries, at least in theory. You could, possibly tap the gallery and then use some sort of pump to wash oil through it and clear away the metal shavings, but it would be a pretty neat trick, requiring lots of clean oil and an interesting pump arrangement to be successful.

If the engine's out and you know a professional, I'd have a talk with a real mechanic/machinist and see what you can work out. Just my opinion...and I'm NOT a professional.

Good luck! Joe
