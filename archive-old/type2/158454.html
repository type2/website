Subject: really rough idle, shaking whole bus

well, adjusted the idle and the mixture.  both to no avail.  the stock 75 FI
setup has me confused.  she also sounds like she misses _at_ idle but she
drives great, the shakes go away and power seems normal when accelerating.
when i come to a stop _at_ say at stop sign or light the shaking starts again.
guess i'll check the plugs see what they look like.  the cap, rotor, plug
wires, petronix are all new(er), less than a year.
