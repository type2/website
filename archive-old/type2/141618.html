Subject: Re: [T2] Bus sightings

&gt; The other is an ad for English chef Jamie Oliver for his&quot;Italian tour&quot; 
&gt; series which ends with a beautiful maroon &amp; cream splitty being driven 
&gt; through the Italian countryside.

Maroon and white? Every time I've seen his lovely 23 Window it's been blue 
and white, including the ads for AN Italian Tour ( we may not have the one 
your seeing yet in Oz ).

BTW: The Hulk was on TV last night, truly crap movie aside from SOME decent 
effects, one fun thing was towards the end of the movie when he was back in 
SF, and although cars were being destroyed by the dozens, AND the street was 
being thrown up behind the nice orange &amp; white Microbus as it was driving 
along the street, it survived unscathed through the destruction, methinks 
there was a bus nut on the team ;^)
