Dear Jamie

I too was surprised to learn that the &quot;new-old-stock&quot; replacement exhaust 
heat exchanger for your VW Type 2, caused fitting problems!

How can you be sure that it was a genuine VW replacement part? Did it have 
the VW or VW-Audi sticker with Genuine Replacement Parts or Ersatz Teile 
script, attached to it. What was the part number?

I was once supplied with a replacement heat exchanger, which was said prior 
to despatch, to be a genuine VW replacement part, but turned out to be from 
Dansk!

I am aware that there may be some problems with other brands of pattern-part 
heat exchangers, but I had yet to lean of such, relating to genuine 
replacement parts.

It was rumoured two years ago that Dansk Autopart A/S, had become the 
official supplier to Volkswagen (GB) Ltd., the official British importer, 
but they declined to confirm or deny the rumour, when asked by my 
acquaintance Neil Birkitt, the former Editor of VW Motoring.

Regards.
          Nigel A. Skeet
