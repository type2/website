Hi jake,

Thing is I live at sea level (well close enough to be the same maybe 600
feet elev?) So what I need for in town and what I need for my trips to the
mountains are different.

I am trying to find a good compromise between the two. I have about 6.9
CRin my 71 bus and that engine has been cool as a cucumber for over 60K
miles and still going, Low CR i like for longevity but higher might be
nice for power What is the ideal compromise I wonder... I'm thinking maybe
7.0:1 or 7.1:1 MAX...

peas,

Steve
