Subject: Re: [T2] Tune Up Time:   Plug for Cylinder #2  (Arrrgh!)

Remove the air cleaner, AFM, black plastic tube that runs from the AFM to 
the throttle body.

Viola! Clear and clean access to your engine. I remove the air cleaner 
every time I do anything significant to my engine - takes less than 30 
seconds if I have to the tools on hand and 6 hours if I have to go looking 
for a Phillips screwdriver. &lt;VBG&gt;

Lot's of things have to get removed for various maintenance routines but 
this engine is still one of the easiest engines I've owned to work on.

Try the front carb manifold nut for cylinder #1 and #2 on my Type IV 
powered Beetle with Dual Dells. Nothing to remove - you can only turn that 
nut a little each time. &lt;VBG&gt; That's the only hard part of that engine though.

At least you didn't drop the plug down into the shrouding - - - I have to 
do that every other time.

Hang in there!!!
