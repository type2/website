&gt;Wade,
&gt;The next time it doe not start, crawl under and give the solenoid a few
good
&gt;whacks ith a hammer (not where the wire connect though).  Then try to start
&gt;it, if it starts right up, then you've got a dirty, rusty solenoid that
&gt;needs replaced.  This happens on my 75 and the hammer trick works every
&gt;time.  You're right though, there is no rhyme nor reason or consistency to
&gt;the starts and no-starts.  I'll bet this is it!

I have found that a the handle from the axe that I carry for camping will
reach in from the wheel well and do the &quot;tonking&quot; just fine.  I have
substituted a broom handle or a shovel handle in a pinch.  Prevents having
to crawl under in nice clothes.  Also improves your chances if you have
someone holding the ignition switch in the start position just before you
tap it.  Usually only takes a small tap when holding the switch.
Mark
