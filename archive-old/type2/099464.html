Subject: Re: [T2] HAH! 3 years getting it home 

I found the product you asked about, offered on the Permatex web site, at 
the following address:

http://www.permatex_dot_com/auto/autouh.asp?f_call=get_item&amp;item_no=26346

It is called METAL REPAIR COMPUND by Permatex, and is part number 26346.

I used some of it packaged under a different distributor name, because it 
was a buck less expensive.

The stuff I used was called &quot;HOT-WELD 2400&quot; Metal Repair Paste. Hot-Weld is 
a metal repair paste and sealant that will withstand temperatures up to 
2,400 degrees. Great Lakes Marketing of America, Inc.  1776 East 116th 
Street, Carmel, IN  46032.
It carried the ID number PN-HW2400 above the bar code 1  54310 2400  4


The NAPA counter man said it was made by PERMATEX and marketed under 
several labels, HOT-WELD among them.  NAPA offered the same product under 
the NAPA label on the display board, and that product said it was made by 
Permatex (but it was a buck more expensive.)

This stuff is a one part water-based ceramic that is safe to use and gets 
stronger with heat, up to 2000 degrees, according to the label.  It is for 
long-lasting low pressure repair of exhaust leaks from the manifold to the 
muffler, and can be used to repair cracked manifolds and furnaces.

I'm sorry I misrepresented it as an epoxy. It is a ceramic, according to 
Permatex.

&lt;&lt; I coated the copper exhaust gaskets with a new product from NAPA, which is
designed to seal exhaust systems and is claimed to withstand 2000 degrees
of temperature. Six bucks a tube. It is a grey pasty material that in a
plastic tube that has been totally evacuated of air. The stuff starts
curing when it hits the atmosphere. You put it where you want it, put the
parts together, and leave it alone for a day or two. It cures in place with
no catalyst other than the air. Then you start the engine and warm it up
for 15 minutes, and the engine heat completes the curing process. It is
some kind of high temperature epoxy, according to the NAPA counter man.
