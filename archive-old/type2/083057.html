Subject: Vac cutoff 

List,
I believe you FI guys can ignore this...
Scanning the bentley - page 73 of section 5 (engine
and clutch) i stumble across ye olde 'vacuum advance
cutoff'.  
Quote: 
&quot;Except for 1974 models with manual transmissions, all
dual carb engines are equipped with an automatic
vacuum advance cutoff. Except in fourth gear, the
vacuum advance is cut off whenever the air temperature
is above 54deg F. This means that vac advance is only
effective in 4th gear and in all other gears in
temperatures below 54deg F&quot;.

I found this in the archives:
http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/type2/002785.html
It is from Rich Patano and was posted in aug 01.
Rich was running a 1700 with a weber prog and dual vac
dist. He wrote:
&quot;I have the advance hose connected from the vacuum
canister to the port at the base of the carburetor,
and I leave the retard port on the vacuum canister
left open and unplugged...Should I prefer the curve of
the 009 or the 050 (very hot weather,  stop and go
traffic requiring high revs in first and second gear),
I can simply disconnect and plug the vacuum hose to
the carb.&quot; 

Of course, the Bentley never presumes to describe the
origin or purpose of the various systems, just how
they work.  Some other archived messages seemed to
imply that the vac advance cutoff was just an
emissions control system.  Others, like mr Patano's
above, seem to imply that VW didn't want the vac
advance to work unless things were really cold or
unless you were at cruising speed. It implies vac
advance could run you hot if its not really cold
outside or you're not moving fast enough.

1. What could be the reason 1974 models didn't have
this system? Was it because the cutoff circuit is an
emmisions control circuit and the emissions control
issues were being met by the new air injection system?


2. I have a rebuilt dual vac dist on order from
busdepot. Since my engine is an 1800 (74 model heads)
that has the emissions system completely stripped and
is installed in a 1974 std bus, should i keep the vac
port plugged when its really hot out?

Possibly over(or under)thinking it,
clark
