&gt; Speaking of chemicals, do any of you folks use EDTA (i.e. ethylene diamine
&gt; tetra acetic acid or its di-sodium salt), in your lead-acid starter
&gt; batteries, to prolong their service lives, by inhibiting the sulphation
&gt; process? We use it in ours, most of which typically last 6 to 8 years.
&gt; The original one on my father's Ford Sierra XR4x4 lasted nearly 13 years.

First of all, this question would have better answered if you had done some
searching on the web or archives first.  You would have received your answer
immediately and this really is streaching it for bus topics.  That being said
and since the original question was a P.S.,

I did a little research on the web, and found that there are two types of EDTA
referenced.

1: tetrasodium EDTA
2: calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (CaEDTA)

#1 is claimed to prolong the life of &quot;infrequently used&quot; batteries.  There are a
number of web pages discussing the use of EDTA and batteries

#2 is used for the chleation treatment when a person has had an exposure to
lead.  The CaEDTA will work to extract the lead.

I also came across a paper that discussed the use of EDTA in the extraction of
Lead that is contanimating soil.

The application of EDTA to batteries discussed dosages of a few teaspoons into
the battery and shake it for a while to work it around.

It looks like the stuff may work by continuously breaking the bonds of the lead
sulfate and keeping it from sticking to the lead plates.  I wonder what keeps it
from attacking the actual lead plates.

To &quot;purge the acid battery and then replace it with EDTA dissolved in water&quot; is
most likely a very good way to guarantee a flat battery.  The acid is there for
a purpose and not a byproduct of battery use.  Fresh batteries are filled with
sulfuric acid.

Prolong service life &quot;6 to 8&quot; years?  A well maintained battery will easily get
that.  These days with the sealed batteries its hard to maintain the battery.
Batteries seemed to be designed to last about 5 years and that's all folks.

Last week I had my students remove two banks of batteries that totaled 40
batteries.  The batteries were installed in 1971 when the building was new.
They were maintained on a weekly basis by the students in the program (I was one
of those students in 75/76, now I'm back to teach the program).  Around 1992
they reached the limit of their lifespan and the amount of charge they would
take started reducing.  When they were working, we would run DC motors off of
them and it was not unusual to see a 120VDC motor running with continuous
current of 60 amps.  We also were able to put the two banks in series to run the
240 volt motors or in parallel for the higher HP 120volt motors.
