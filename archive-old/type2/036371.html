Subject: Gas price rip offs

Is anyone outraged over fuel prices?  Where is the outrage?!?!?

Remember the Gulf War?  Prices rose drastically and we were told that once it 
was over things would be back to normal.  Well, it never happened.   Fast 
forward to 1999 and we have the lowest gas prices in many years.  Here in 
Florida I was paying $.92 a gallon for reg gas.  Then prices began rising 
(&quot;for summer driving&quot;) and we were told they'd lower during the winter.  Ah, 
but the heating oil keeps prices up...so they will lower in the spring.  Oh, 
but oil companies cut production by 8%.  Hmm, let me do the math.  Prices 
have risen 40% higher and production has only been cut by 8%.  I see a DIRECT 
rip off on consumers here.  Doesn't anyone else see this?  Does anybody care? 
Maybe there is no outrage because everyone thinks &quot;what can we do?&quot;  We can 
speak out and TRY to make a difference.  Let these companies know that we see 
their scams!
