Subject: Splitty body for sale....RESCUE OPERATION

hey now,

richard...RESCUE RESCUE RESCUE...i was over had Thoff (local Ripoff Vw parts
place) and there was a guy in there from wilson nc who has a shop down there.
called Ellis Volkswagen. we were talking vw, and he was telling me about a bug
they were hacking and lowering and painting bright pink. (ACK!) anyways, to
make a short story longer, we bs'd for awhile and i asked if he had any old
pre 68 busses 'laying around'. he said he had a '67 body, with 'some' rust
on it but no holes, etc. supposedly in fair condition. he wants to get rid of
it and i asked how much...he said $100..no engine. said it's a kombi. i got
the impression that this is taking up room in at his shop and may be doomed
soon. i'd be willing to go to wilson and check it out. anyone else?
while he didn't specifically say that it was going to a crusher, it was clear
that it's taking up room.
