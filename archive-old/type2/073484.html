&gt;it, i also want to mount a relay for a duel battery kit there.

I wouldn't mount it there.  If it springs a leak, it would be spraying fuel
over a hot engine - very bad.  I mounted mine on the frame outside the
engine compartment and will go back to a nice, quiet, safe(r) mechanical
one very soon now.
