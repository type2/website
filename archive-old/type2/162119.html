Subject: Re: [T2] the hubcap

Hi Volks,

OK, we've now determined that the hubcap is stranded in Albuequeque  
NM, and I should soon have the email of its current custodian.

Somehow I seemed to have stepped into the role of cat-herder again.  
You think I'd know better by now.

Are there any listmembers who travel near ABQ??   Who wants it  
next??  Right now the preference is to get it into the hands of the  
west-coast listees.  I'm thinking Ratwell, George Lyle, John Kolak,  
Don Tujela &amp; Troy should be high on the list, and so should Mark  
Hineline, even if he's just riding along inside a bus with it for a  
while. But there's plenty of hubcap to go around... p-mail me if  
you're interested and we'll see if we can get this thing moving again.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
