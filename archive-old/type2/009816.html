&gt; Personally, I see nothing at all wrong with the existing resources
&gt; available here on the list.  Whenever I have needed help or advice,
I have
&gt; always gotten a response from somebody on the list.  

The thrust here is how to speed up response when one is stranded.  The
normal one or two day lag time is fine when I'm working on a problem
in my driveway, but pretty long if I am sitting in Beautiful Downtown
Pioche, NV.

&gt; While good intentions are running very strong here, I have been
reading a
&gt; lot of bad ideas.  A &quot;list relief fund&quot; or a &quot;list parts warehouse&quot;
involve
&gt; somebody spending time and/or money to maintain and will, I repeat
WILL,
&gt; eventually be the subject of a dispute over who controls the
valuables.

I agree.  I wouldn't want to be responsible for such problems.

&gt; The idea of creating a database of list members' addresses and phone
&gt; numbers is a really BAD idea, and one to which I will object
vociferously.
&gt; Everyone on the list please be advised you do not have my permission
to put
&gt; my name in any such database.

Any such Rescue Squad list would, by necessity, be a voluntary effort.
 Since the list doesn't have any record of where listees live, one
would have to provide this information.  This could even be a
&quot;membership requirement&quot; of the Rescue Squad:  You have to be signed
up on the Rescue Squad for, say, a month before you will get access to
the member database.

The database couldn't be in the form of a raw list.  It would be a web
resource into which you would have to input a geographical location to
access data about nearby Rescue Squad members and resources.

BTW, nothing you do on the internet is private.  My name and yours is
in more databases than you can shake a stick at.  This is nothing new,
and such databases have existed far longer than the internet.

&gt; I see nothing whatsoever wrong with continuing to use the list just
as it
&gt; exists now.  Anyone who needs help is welcome to post a message, and
if I
&gt; am in a position to help I am going to respond.

The list is great and will continue!  However, if it can be made more
useful then that should be pursued.
