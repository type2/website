&gt; &gt;early muffler also, with the 4 connections for the heater/manifolds.  He
&gt; &gt;said the only reason they went to the separate manifold/upipes/heaterbox
&gt; &gt;(read more places to leak) was to accomodate the insertion of the catalytic
&gt; &gt;for California.   Ron Salmon verified this should work, having gotten it
&gt; &gt;from AVP
&gt; 
&gt; Been there, done that of course.  One important thing to note, although I've
&gt; said it many times that nearly any T4 Bus exhaust will fit on any T4 Bus
&gt; ('79 the only exception of course with square port heads) there is a slight
&gt; obnoxious kicker to doing this.  That is the fact that the tubes up to the
&gt; heater flapper boxes changed contour.  I'm not sure without looking but if I
&gt; had to guess I'd say '72-'74 use a round shaped joint at the heater box and
&gt; '75-'78 use an oval joint.  And with these already very tough to fit right
&gt; on aftermarket Dansk boxes, you need the right parts.  So anyone considering
&gt; this conversion would be wise to find the heater parts as well.  I like the
&gt; '72-'74 system better for other reasons, the header and U tube arrangement
&gt; also has the tendancy to bend in over the years disaligning the heater boxes
&gt; and making muffler installation a PITA.  In addition I think the early ones
&gt; might heat marginally better as well, plus the exceptionally high quality
&gt; Dansk OEM replacement '72-'74 style muffler is available for the early
&gt; system.  One more note that strikes me, there is a possibility that the
&gt; under cylinder tins are different as well for these boxes, 
John:
You're right about the under cylinder tins and the ducts to the heater
flappers, but there are 4 other parts you'll need also: L &amp; R lower
front cylinder tins and the support brackets  at the muffler- the left
is just a link w/2 holes that goes from the fan housing (?) to the
muffler joint, the right is actually the alternator adjustment bracket
as well and its lower end supports the muffler. I'd say without these
two additional supports the exchangers will probably droop and cause
leaks at the cylinder head- heat exchanger joint (which is always a leak
prone area anyhow!)
