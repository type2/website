Subject: Re: [T2] Welding your VW

&gt;&gt; to as low as $350-400, they are all about the same in this price range,
things
&gt;&gt; to look at are what you think of the feed roller system (how well you think
&gt;&gt; it might hold up, plastic (Lincoln) versus metal (Century)) whether it
takes
&gt;
&gt;For what it's worth...my lincoln uses a metal feed roller.   (assuming you
&gt;mean the part that drives the wire itself)

Actually I meant the support structure holding the drive roller, when I looked
at em the Lincoln was plastic, mine was cheesey cast aluminum, but metal
at least.  Yes both rollers were metal.  I think the Century is now plastic as
well anyway...
