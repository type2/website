&gt; Yeah, there has been a lot of offshore outfits buying up companies with
&gt; &quot;solid American names&quot; and producing cheap junk with that name on it.
&gt; Emerson, Singer and Stanley leap to mind.
&gt; 
&gt;    I'd have thought it was just profit making by the &quot;solid American names&quot;
who lease out their names to product lines that have nothing to do with
them...Emerson Electric makes a line of power tools under the Ridgid
(the Snap-On of plumbing tools) name...BTW, that solid American com-
pany, the Stanley Toolworks of New Britain, Connecticut, almost moved
offshore itself...Tho' it was only on paper to the Caribbean, and only for
tax evasion purposes... ;-(
