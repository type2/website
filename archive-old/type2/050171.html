Subject: [T2] running badly/new question

Thanks to all that have responded....... have check out much of the suggestions and so far..... nothing...... but here is a new thought..... will a muffler coming apart inside cause this?  I went out and cranked her up just now and she started with the first turn of the key and will idle for a while, never tried to die, just no power,and kind of chugs.... and there is a bad exhaust smell,, and , the backfiring has cause the tail pipe to fall off and is just being held on right now by wire. (just a thought) any ideas on this would be appreciated.........
