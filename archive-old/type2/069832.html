Oh Mike! Please don't do this again!

cinderblocks have a nasty habit of fracturing/ crumbling without warning. 
More than one home mechanic has been killed/ maimed when a cinderblock
supporting their auto crumbled and dropped their car on them. Use wood, or
buy/ borrow the right jack stands. Being killed by your own car SUCKS!

No joke, please be safe,
