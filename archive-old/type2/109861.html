George--

Your facts are a little twisted here this morning--

Methane is NOT natural gas--

You ought to take the time to examine the product info site---just for
fun to see what this stuff is all about--

Great scare tatics you layed on the list--

I enjoyed it--

Fact--
Methane is not Butane
Since we're discussing facts:
Fact--
Methane is a flammable gas just like propane and butane. When I camp, I
cook with propane and butane. When I'm at home I cook with methane
(which is also called &quot;Natural Gas.&quot;
Fact--
Methane boils at -164C. Freon 12 boils at -30C. There's no way that a
methane refrigerant can replace Freon 12. The reason that F-12 replaced
a propane/butane mixure in the first place is that propane boils at -42C
and butane boils at 0C. A mixture of the two therefore boils at about
the same temperature as the F-12 that replaced the mixtire.
This isn't to say that a propane/butane mixure isn't a dandy
refrigerant. It worked very well before freon came along and continues
to work well even though DuPont would rather you use their stuff.
If someone is telling you that they have a methane refrigerant that can
replace F-12 I would be suspicious of their claims. They have either
figured out a way to magically alter the physical properties of methane
or they simply don't know the difference between the various
hydrocarbons.
