Subject: Re: [T2] VW Hippie Bashing

He (Hitler) built the cars very much ......... the same
&gt; way that Henry Ford produced the Model-T.

Not so, really. It was more correctly stated that the &quot;people's cars&quot; were
produced by the order of socialist government leadership (Hitler). He
ordered this for his own end goals, but making a profit in a capitalist
venture was not one of them. Henry Ford, on the other hand, had dollar signs
dancing in his eyes when he built his first cars, and government had no part
in it.
Socialism, by the way, could be defined as a style of government in which
the state controls all enterprise, industry and resources for the benefit of
the state and the people, in a larger sense. Individual rights are not
addressed by a socialist government. In case you may have noticed that we
have less individual rights lately, this may be a clue as to what direction
we are headed. The Democrat party is basically a socialist party now, and
the oppressive aspects of government that we see these days reflect a
socialist agenda operating through a fascist means of organization and
enforcement. Socialist governments can do a lot of good overall (as some
still argue that Hitler did), but they are notoriously oppressive and eat
&quot;big badasses&quot; like you and me for breakfast. THEY destroy anyone who gets
in THEIR way or who has something that they WANT.

&gt; Anyway, I was speaking originally from a more modern stand-point. East
&gt; Germany became the communist side of the country.. which produced very
&gt; little. The West side was the capitalist side of the country. That's where
&gt; the Volkswagen was produced (correct me if I'm wrong, please).

I got to know some people in East Germany pretty well after the repatriation
of the two Germany's. Their attitude was &quot;why bother&quot;? They did what they
were told to do, or not to do, as the case may be. But there were so many
stories of people painting until they ran out of paint and walking away from
the job, or people driving a truck full of hogs until it broke down and
walking away from it (hogs died, pork wasted). Nobody cared. Nobody tried.
Why should they? The government provided the basics and there was nothing
more than the basics to be had. Camera shops with no cameras. No
supermarkets. I saw a &quot;wanted&quot; ad in a dog magazine for a dog brush. You
couldn't even buy a dog brush, and people made their own training collars
out of welded wire. Some of those people over there were so, well.. stupid..
that they were almost drooling on themselves. They didn't care about money.
Money had nothing to buy. Yes, they lived, but it was not much of a life.
And everyone was afraid of the Stazi.
On the other hand, engineering, industry, international commerce and yes,
Volkswagens did wonders for West Germany's recovery. They were becoming a
modern and affluent country again only 20 years after the end of a war that
nearly destroyed it.
Like I said, capitalism is simply the best way of spreading the love.
One of the bad things that has come of the Volkswagen in Germany is the fact
that there was such a really HUGE demand for these cars worldwide that
German laborers could not fill the demand and Germany brought in a lot of
foreigners, mainly Turks, to work in the plants, which ran 24/7. Now,
Germans tried very hard to be tolerant for many years, but it just seems to
go against their grain. Now, the Turks have long since settled down, not
without problems, and a lot of them were rather suddenly without work when
the Japanese cars took the place of the VW. So, they went on the dole. It
has been an uncomfortable relationship ever since. Germany finds itself
bombarded from all sides by foreigners who have already or are relocating
there to find a better way of life, and it's bringing down the quality of
life for Germans. Former West Germans have been known to give former East
Germans the finger just on principle. Taxes went sky high to pay for the
costs of repatriation and rebuilding (The communists had done little to
repair damaged buildings and infrastructure after the war and I saw lots of
burned and bombed-out ruins when I was over there).
It's all very interesting, really, and a case could be made for capitalism
vs. communism/socialism based on a comparative study of the two post WW2
Germany's. But the Volkswagen played a very important part in the social,
political and economic history of modern Germany. Ironically, when I was
over there in 1990 or 1991, I saw more Ford Taurus's and other Ford products
than anything else.
