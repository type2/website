List,


The 2 1/16&quot; hole saw is available in an inch size. Milwakee make one, as do
starrette. The bimetal type are for metal cutting. They are not at your
&quot;mall&quot; type stores, but at specialty stores that sell machinist tools.
Online merchants will carry it as well.

I have done this gauge mounting and I like it. The only thing I don't enjoy
is that the gauges are at a poor angle to see accurately. But it looks very
good and everyone in my local club who has seen the installation appreciates
it. 

Be very careful when you lay out the holes, and drill a small (1/8&quot;) pilot
hole for each. The padding on the dash is about 3/4&quot; thick, so the hole
center may deviate from where you lay it out on the pad surface to where it
actually pierces the metal below, and this can cause the holes to get out of
alignment. Andy is right on about the radio, it must be gone to get at the
area for installation, removing the glove box helps too.
