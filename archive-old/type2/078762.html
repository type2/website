&gt; My 78' Westy came without a driver's seat. The passenger front seat is
&gt; rather uncomfortable as well. I found I was able to put a drivers seat from
&gt; my buddy's 85' vanagon in no problem. What I'm wonering is:

yeah I have vanagon seats in my 78
&gt; 
&gt; (a) Will the passenger seat swap as well?

yes

&gt; (b) Will all other year vanagon fron seats swap?

not all years fit, not sure when the change was, but at some point mid
80's the tracks changed and they won't fit.

you will probably have to remove the armrests

&gt; The vanagon seats are much more comfortable, but I dont want to by a set
&gt; from a junk yard only to ahve them not fit. Any help here would be
&gt; appreciated. I don't want to do any cutting or welding...
