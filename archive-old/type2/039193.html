&gt; Yes, ya gotta get on your hands and knees, and maybe stand on your head in 
&gt; the engine compartment, but if you start with the middle of the foam &quot;snake&quot; 
&gt; at the middle of the firewall tin, and lead it over, under, around, and thru 

I prefer to start in the back.  with the center in front of the fan,
there after working it around towards the front of the bus. on the right
side (looking toward the front of the bus)about halfway to the front I
stuff it all through to the underside and put that part up from under the
van.  the wiring and fuel lines and air cleaner leave very little room
from the top.

if there is a gap it is in the center of the firewall.  reasons, shorter
pieces to work around the harder parts in the front, if there is a gap in
the foam the center front has no heat source so there is less heat to seep
in if there is a gap....also if per chance it begins to unravel or come
out it won't get sucked into the fan 

&gt; The foam has a coated side, and an uncoated side. I think the uncoated side 
&gt; is meant for the exterior, but most of the gunk that it will be exposed to 

true the coated side is out and resists the exhaust heat better

&gt; to come thru. I covered these holes with metallic duct tape [made from heavy 
&gt; aluminum foil-got it from an A/C guy] Wipe the gunk off with a rag first.

called foil tape or insulation tape it is avaliable at home depot
