I wonder what I just bought? Is it a Westy or something else?
It's a 1970 poptop and the Westfalia ID plate says &quot;SO 69/3 0.0280&quot;. It is
not a &quot;walkthrough&quot;. Instead it has cabinetry along the divider containing a
2 burner propane stove, a sink and an Electrolux refrigerator. Under the
sink it has the water jug and a &quot;5 gal&quot; propane tank with German writing on
it. There is a 6&quot; square hole in the floor under the sink covered with heavy
wire mesh screening. It doesn't have a rear-facing jumpseat behind the
drivers seat as the above mentioned cabinetry runs from the sliding door (it
has a footstep that slides out when you open the door) to a narrow closet
behind the drivers seat. It has a jumpseat facing the sliding door
containing a porta-potti. It does not have jalousie windows on both
sides---just on the sliding door (wish it had them on both sides as the
jumpseat/porta-potti sits under the non-jalousied window).
It does not have a shelf/cabinet over the rear cargo area. The bed is wider
than usual because the spare tire is stowed under the front 2/1 bench seat.
It has a factory installed Eberspacher heater. The engine is a 1600SP.
This $500 VW bus (drove it home--needs brake and clutch work) caught my
interest because I had never seen
one like it.
In case it helps---M-Code plate says:
02 216 928
514 517 518 524 530
5236 72 089 119 121 500
22 5 7587 041 2310 21

Any info or help would be appreciated.
