Subject: Re: [T2] Thieves hit my westy! Help replacing front window!

When I lived in the big *hitty, I found that the best thief protection 
was to leave nothing in the vehicle worth stealing and leave it 
unlocked.  Experience taught me that whatever was stolen was *always* 
worth less that the amount of damage done getting into the car. 
ALWAYS! $25 stereo = $250 worth of damage. $10 stereo = no damage. (Not 
worth stealing...)

&gt; hi.

&gt; I was crushed yesterday to find that someone had broken into my 76 westy.
&gt; the bastard thief used the traditional method of breaking into a bus and
&gt; wedged a tool in the small front window on the passenger side. the good news
&gt; is that they didn't break the window, the bad news is they bent the frame
&gt; and latch all to hell.
