Not if you are building a recirculating system and drawing the air to
the exchangers from the inside of the bus - In fact, by blocking off the
outlets on the fan where heat would normally be sent to the exchangers,
I should actually *increase* the amount of air blowing over the cylinder
heads. 

Sorry, my good man. Plenty of heat, but no flames here! ;)
