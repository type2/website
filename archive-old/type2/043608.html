Subject: Re: Cleaning caked engine parts

By the way, The stuff in the bags labeled with the brand name &quot;TSP&quot; isn't
really tri-sodium-phosphate!  It's some substitute cleaning agent that
doesn't contain phosphates.  Phosphates are an ecological bogeyman because
they are a terrific fertilizer and tend to promote plant growth in
waterways that have sewage dumped into them, so don't do that.

_Real_ TSP is available and is the preferable material.  It is usually
found in white bags right next to the brand name ersatz &quot;TSP&quot;.

Dispose of the cleaning solution by allowing it to sit and cool, then skim
the oil from the surface.  The remaining liquid can be poured on your
lawn, which will love it.  Be sure to spread it around over a large areas
so the grass won't OD on the fertilizer!

If you have bare metal parts, don't forget to primer them before you paint
them!  Unless it's special stuff, the finish paint will not stick well to
the bare metal
