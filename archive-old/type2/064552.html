&gt; I absolutely agree on this. Steve Tokar and I are currently taking a
&gt; class on VW repair, and the guy who is teaching the class is a *good* &amp;
&gt; *honest* VW trained mechanic with over 35 years experience with VW's.
&gt; 
&gt; He's currently rebuilding a T4 engine from the ground up, and he's going
&gt; to charge $3000 for it. My jaw dropped when I heard this. I mean,
&gt; shheeesh, them's a lot of clams for a VW engine. Granted he's using all
&gt; the right parts in it, and doing a quality rebuild. But that's a lot of
&gt; money.

Been there, done that, still paying the bills!

Those engines are NOT cheap, and they are not anything like the old 
busses. Just for the little seals and flapper valves... a small baggie 
that wouldn't carry a dozen candy bars... and I spent more than when I 
rebuilt the heads! When the carbs went &quot;bad&quot; from sitting, the local 
dealer told me they went for $800 each (and there's two, count 'em, 
plus the idling circuit).

I'm told those engines are quality... and you pay for quality.
