&gt;Didn't we just address this one recently?  I tried a three-arm puller and
all it did was bend the ears on the hub.  Ended up letting the machine shop
remove it.  I suppose a three arm puller might work, if you're luckier than
me, or if you made a good strong ring to bolt to the hub and pull on.

I used cheap 3 arm puller from flaps on rebuild last year..worked fine. DO
like Clarks' free puller much better however :)
