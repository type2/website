Subject: Re: [T2] Difference between 1971 vs. 1968 Engines

 Just to be clear, that bolt still is inserted from front to back, and it 
 screws into this flange.  I'm off to the hardware store this morning to 
 pick up a new bolt.

A word of advice:  Get a Allen headed bolt!

The original 68 bolt was a D bolt with the nut on the engine side. The trans has casting to allow the 
head of the D bolt to lock in place.

Now you are wanting to put a hex headed bolt in from the trans side.......
Guess what happens when that hex head locks in place?
It is not a pretty picture!
