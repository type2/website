&gt; I have a 76 bus that needs a new head gasket. I had contemplated taking the
&gt; engine out, but I am moving from Alameda to Palo Alto and thought it might
&gt; be easier to tow the bus to Palo Alto. The only problem is that my mechanic
&gt; is too far away. Does anyone know a trustworthy mechanic in the Palo Alto
&gt; Area? Or does anyone have the tools to take the engine out? It is a 2000cc
&gt; fuel injected.

If you have a floor jack, a couple of cinder blocks to rest the engine on,
and a socket set that has sockets up to 17mm, plus a torque wrench, about
one day's time and a helper, you can do this yourself. It's not difficult,
but it is extremely heavy work so I think everyone should have a helper when
they do this.

Your engine has &quot;gasket rings&quot; and not a head gasket like you'll find on a
watercooled engine.

Before you do this, though, use your torque wrench to set all the head nuts,
on both sides of the engine, to 23 lb-ft and see if that fixes it. Sometimes
these nuts do come loose. You can do this with the engine in, although you
need to remove all the cooling tin to get to the top nuts and you have to
take the rocker arms off to get to the bottom ones.
