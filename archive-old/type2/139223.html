Subject: Re: [T2] Re: AC in Southern Buses

Sayeth Anton:

The idea of putting Subie running gear in a bus is sort of tempting. I 
saw a few that had the retrofit, and for the money, it makes more sense 
than paying $25K for a good synchro. My wife and I both have Subarus 
(Outback &amp; Outback Sport) and LOVE them. Reliable, safe, and fun to 
drive through hurricanes in.

And A/C, of course!


Quoteth Joe:

By that competitive-edge logic, couldn't one also argue that you should 
swap out to a Subaru engine (no sense in losing that edge of 
acceleration and cruising speed), add crash protection to current 
standards, etc.?
