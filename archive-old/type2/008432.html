&gt; Fred, George and listees,
&gt; 
&gt; When I got my 74 Bug it had the aftermarket filter pump, that engine
has
&gt; covered serious amounts of kilometers without problems. However
there is
&gt; something itching the back of my brain about the solution. Since the
filter
&gt; is located where the hot air from the cylinders blows on the front
of the
&gt; filter and the hot exhaust system on the back of it, doesn't that
heat the
&gt; filter and the oil in it?

It might, but the heat transfer area on the filter doesn't amount to
much.  Also, it's likely that the oil is somewhere near the air
temperature anyway.  Figure that the air is around 80C (assuming that
the thermostat is doing its thing).  At this temperature there isn't
enough difference between the air temp and the oil temp for much heat
to transfer either way.

VW de Mexico has enough confidence to run this setup and I know from
personal experience that it can get might hot in those parts!
