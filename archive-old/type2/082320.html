Subject: Re: [T2]  spare tire mount

Kevin
If you really want the trick mounting deal...Try...bluebird_dot_com...out of the 
Uk. They have a really nice rear bumper swingdown tire mount.  I inquired 
about shipping it here to hawaii and the cost of the mount is $100 plus $100 
shipping, but to the mainland probably 1/2 that in shipping.
