Subject: RE: [T2] Synthetic Oil

  I switched to Mobil 1 15/50 3 oil changes ago and will never use dino
again. The engine had 15,000 plus miles at the switch and have added 10,000
more since then, smoother, cooler and less consumption.

&gt; I posted a couple days ago about an apparent pressure drop after switching
&gt; to Mobil 1 oil. Those readings were takem during my usual 10 mile commute
to
&gt; and from work. Tonight I had the opportunity for a little road trip, about
&gt; 50 miles on the Parkway. After about 40 minutes running at 55 - 60 over
&gt; gently rolling terrain I can officially state that Mobil 1 SUCKS!!!
&gt; Absolutely the WORST oil pressure readings across the board! Oil temp
stayed
&gt; in the normal range, maxed at about 220; head temps were also normal. The
&gt; pressure dropped to about 25psi at 55 mph, and for the first time ever the
&gt; oil light came on at idle.

you might also take this as a caution that bearings or other surfaces are
worn, ALL synthetics have a smaller molecular size than dino and will leak
past loose bearings etc....this is typical of synthetic.

my mobil 1 in a recently rebuilt engine (10,000 miles or so) and at 220
temps at 55mph it goes no lower than 45psi, and so far the oil light has
not come on, in fact about 25psi at idle

2 liter FI stock except for pertronix

YMMV
