It's called the check valve.  If you blow through it in the direction of
the arrow, the air should flow freely.  If you blow through it in the
direction opposite the arrow, no air should flow.

The purpose of this is to maintain a high vacuum in the brake booster when
the engine vacuum decreases (such as during acceleration.)

I bought one from VW a few years back.  It looked considerably different
from the original part, but worked fine.

&gt; What exactly is that plastic bit called that goes in the vacuum line for

&gt; little arrow that points at the motor. What does it do? IIRC, Bentley
&gt; tells how to test it, but my Bentley's in the bus at the shop.
