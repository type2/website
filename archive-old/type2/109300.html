You might want to try German Auto Salvage in Boring. I was out there this
past weekend and he seemed to have quite a few exterior pieces. I didnt pay
that much attention though. Sometimes they will let you wander the yard if
you seem to know what you are talking about.

Good Luck

&gt; My next question is, are there any junkyards in Portland that have Busses
&gt; in them that are not picked clean? (stop laughing....)If not, where around
&gt; here would you go?
