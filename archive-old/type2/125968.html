Subject: Re: [T2] Bringing the Bus home.

Fix the cooling (buy used tin and paint it) and drive it 'til it dies. There are several folks and companies selling tin. The list can point you to them. At least you are looking for VW Type I tin shared by buses, Beetle, Ghias, Things, etc. etc. 

Buy a used engine for $100 and rebuild it out of your beer money. Assuming you have a year to do it, you'll never notice the cost. 

Remember new cars are $300-$400 a month. That is ALOT more expensive than fixing an old VW right the first time. Cost of ownership of a new car is MUCH higher than your old VW.
