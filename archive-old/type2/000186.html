Message-ID: &lt;0.e8c5d6ed.255b60fe_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Hello all,
   Is there anyone out there that can help me find a sliding metal sunroof 
for my '73?
The PO started a camper conversion but left it half done.
   Is there a way to find the history on my bus (PO's, Where it's been 
etc...) Maybe I could find out what they did with the original top?
  Repairs/resto are going pretty well otherwise. Still need middle seats too 
but not as badly as a roof (brrrr). Still have Westy top if I could just 
figure a way to attach it.?
  Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks in advance for any help you could give me.
