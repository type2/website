Subject: [T2] Steve's Lock Shoppe

Just a quick public word of thanks to Steve Sandlin-

I think it's very important to acknowledge good service as well as poor
service we all get.

I have a 72 Westy that came with only one key.
from the list I found out we had a fellow listee who specializes in VW
I gave Steve an email query and he told me exactly where (and how) to pull a
lock and find the key code. (The rear hatch is the easiest)
He also asked for a photocopy of my original key just in case (which I
forgot to include).

Gave him the Key code and in a matter of days the keys I ordered came in the
mail.
&quot;Hey, these aren't even close!&quot;
Sent another email to Steve with a copy of the old and new keys and he
determined the rear hatch lock had probably been replaced and re-keyed to
match the rest.
Steve then by looking at my old key, came up with the &quot;correct&quot; code and cut
a new one.
It arrived today and it works better than the original I had.

So, a very big Thanks to Steve!  Great Customer Service!

Thanks!
