&gt; correct or way off here?????

You should be able to. If you've got a gap on both of them, then you're at TDC - apporoximately. 
Tang in dist drive gear should be offset towards flywheel and at 12deg with respect to line perpendicular to case parting line - i think thats right. :p
good luck

Q: why is he showing any valve lash at all?  Aren't hyd supposed to be at at least 0.0&quot; ?  Maybe the lifters have lost their pressure?
