&gt; CIP1 has just released BRMs for 71 and later bays, finally a custom
&gt; aftermarket wheel. I just called and they have 2 sets left.

More came in. I got this from CIP1's mailing list and they've dropped the
price:

We have received another shipment of our Bus 71-79 5 x 112mm and Beetle 4
spoke BRM replica wheels. The first shipment didn9t last long, so if you are
interested in a set of these beautifully made wheels, don9t waste any time.
We have also gotten back into stock, our replacement chrome front window
trim frames for Type-3 VW We haven9t had these available for over a year.
They have now been retooled and fit like the original German made frames For
a limited time we have lowered the price by 25% to $119.95 for a pair. Check
out the rest of this newsletter, as we continue to find the best possible
Volkswagen customer &amp; restoration parts at lower PRICES! Save up to 39% on
items in this newsletter. Thank you again for making Cip1_dot_com your choice
for VW parts &amp; accessories
