Dale,  I guess the most obvious thing to do is leave something at the
campsite that shows your *ownership*, without being worried of its
getting stolen.  What I most often use is a tablecloth held down with a
couple pieces of firewood, and of course a jar or vase with some
wildflowers on the table to give the site the necessary feeling of love
and calm.
