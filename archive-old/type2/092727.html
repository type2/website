&gt;STAHLWILLE GERMANY OFFSET WRENCH LIKE NEW Item # 2030839543

I use a wrench similar to the above that I bought while I was living in 
Germany.  It is branded &quot;Gedore&quot; and is a 12/13&quot; 12-point offset box-end 
wrench.  Works great for the valves (well, back when I had solids) and as 
an added bonus the 12&quot; side fits the funky 12-pt bolts that attach the 
drive shaft to the pinion flange in my Mustang.  I know the wrench is good 
quality because the wrench is long (about 11&quot;) and I put all my weight into 
it when tightening those drive shaft bolts.  Don't know if Gedore is 
available in the States but if I saw them I would buy them.
