Subject: Re: [T2] Gas filler neck- pump it yourself, even NJ!

Gentlepersons-
                       When I was immortal and rode a Bonneville (not 
pontiac), it was always
easier to explain to the attendant that if he spilled any gas on the bike, 
he'd clean it.
Usually resulted in the pump being handed to me. Since I live in NJ, I get my 
gas at the
same place and don't have a problem with self service with my type 2, but 
whenever
I do use another station the cleaning line seems to work...at minimum wage 
those guys
don't want to do any more work than necessary.
