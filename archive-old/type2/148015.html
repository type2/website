Hi Mark,

It might help to take a look at the fan grilles used in the PC Mod  
community... Those guys have lots of different sized grille options  
for those who are looking to vent their high-performance gaming rigs.

Here's an example; it's not perfect for your application but I'm sure  
the design could be modified to improve airflow.

If you had one cut from copper you could chrome it; that'd be good  
for an extra 5HP for sure!   ;-P


Happy trails,

&gt; Dave,
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for the reminder about chasing the threads. And for  
&gt; &quot;testifying&quot; about your success with having your shroud  
&gt; powdercoated. Considering (1) how prominent the shroud is in the  
&gt; engine bay, and (2) how difficult it is to work with, I'm now  
&gt; convinced that powdercoating is hands down the way to go.
&gt;
&gt; I've been thinking about making a metal fan guard and powder  
&gt; coating it, as well. Very light welding rod might work. I'd have to  
&gt; set up a buck, weave the wire, solder the intersections, make a  
&gt; ring and tabs, and send it off to be powder coated. Might be a big  
&gt; improvement on (ratty) plastic guard.
&gt;
&gt; I'm going to try to take a picture with more accurate color today.
