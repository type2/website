Subject: Advice on Jalousie window adjustment on 78 Westy

I am restoring my 1978 Westfalia deluxe, and recently had the
jalousie windows re-sealed with Wolfsburg West seal kit. I re-installed
them today in the Bus and found the sliding door window has a problem.

When I close it tightly, the left side or rear of the outside window seats
nice on all 3 panes, but
the front or right of the 3 panes do not seat correctly. The top pane seats
closed all the way.
The middle pane has about an 1/8&quot; gap not closed, and the bottom pane has
about
a 1/4&quot; gap. Unfortunately this is the side where all the wind will hit.

I can't see anything wrong with it. Are there any good ideas on how to adjust
?
Has anyone else had this problem ?

Thanks !
Dean
