Subject: Heater booster idea - $17

I just had a flash of a thought. Our OEM booster fans do work but lack some get-up and go where we need it the most - airflow. How about a $18 solution? 

I'm going to use a bilge blower for $18 but there are probably quieter solutions... 

Simply plumb the output of the bilge blower into the OEM booster with a piece of short felxible hose aka aluminum dryer hose or something like it. use the OEM booster in stock form and add a toggle switch and relay for when you want to run the bilge blower too. Wire it so the bilge blower only comes on when the OEM blower is capable of running (i.e. when the heater flappers are completely open). You could also diasble the OEM blower too. Or add a switch to turn the OEM off and the bilge on... Just whatever meets your needs best. 

Just an idea. A cheap idea. 

Now back to my day dreaming... Where was I? Oh yeah - Italy....
