Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Burden or Blessing?

i stayed with vw buses because it felt right. along the way i acquired a
pile of satisfaction in fixing them up a little which has carried over into
other aspects of my life. buying an old house and repairing and maintaining
a home has lots of parallels for me. good buslife more than compensates for
the times i have been let down by bad buslife moments in the past.  in
retrospect, i had let those moments happen to myself. maintenance. i
suppose i could say the same for beetles and such, but i have needed the
function provided by buses from the get go. i don't care how slow they go:
i'm in no hurry, and i've never had an accident in one. never had a moving
violation in one. they're my governor. having said that, i bought a
doublecab last december, out of state, practically sight unseen on my 40th
birthday. i needed something else to do with my hands so soon after my
father passed away. i never had doubts this cast-off-as-trash bus would
make it through, thanks in most part to this list, and my supportive wife
and children.  today was the day dividends were paid. the doublecab ran as
good as any old vw bus. today it passed the payload test with 1/2 yard of
soil down bumpy hilly, tall grass alleys. tomorrow i'm going for the full
yard. new distributer; and the rear cab vent wing gaskets arrived from
austrailia (what is this list a dream?) THANKS!ST.STEPHEN.  - its a
blessing.  nearly 500 miles on it and today was the first real fweem spirit
both inside the rig, and out. ramble on rose.

&gt;The VW bus is my participation in this incarnations creation or
&gt;creativity.  If
&gt;god is omnipresent, then the bus is also, along with all matter, a
&gt;vehicle, :'),
&gt;to and for the spirit.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;Why do we love our vans so much even though they require so much work and
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;go so slow?
