From: &quot;Westyman&quot; &lt;THEWESTYMAN_at_MINDSPRING.COM&gt;


Two new offerings from Propex, available immediately:

First, a larger version of the Propex EX/HS 1800 furnace, the HS 2800 with
9500 btus of safe, efficient, externally vented propane heat. Pricing for
the larger unit will be $670 versus the EX 1800 at $525 or HS 1800 at $595.
This new unit (also the HS 1800) have self diagnostics and additional safety
features as required in the EU.

Second, a 13.5 liter propane fired water heater, the 'Malaga'. Pricing will
be $349. The unit is small enough to fit into the small cubby of the Vanagon
Westfalia left of the fridge, and is self regulated just like a home type
water heater.

If you'd like more info or to order any of the Propex products, please email
me directly, I have a shipment coming within the next couple weeks. A photo
of the heaters can be seen at www.propexheatsource.co_dot_uk and soon to be seen
on my web site, TBA.
