Subject: Re: [T2] h4 headlights

As long as you get the correct style lights, they are no different from 
the Hella's outside of the quality of the lens. The pattern and 
direction are the same, so long as you get ones specific for driving on 
the right side of the road. (everyone mentions this, but im not sure 
where anyone is even buying their headlight replacements from here in 
the US where they actually are setup for left side of the road driving, 
which then WOULD blind oncoming traffic.)

&gt; The H4 headlights are not street legal for a reason. In addition to the
&gt; added brightness, the beam shape is not correct and will shine into oncoming
&gt; drivers' eyes. Be curteous and safe... stick with the street legal
&gt; headlights. No one wants to be involved in a head-on because they were
&gt; blinded by some redneck's brights. The Whitney catalog has the street legal
&gt; Hellas for the same price as Bus Depot's H4's. Don't let money be the reason
&gt; that you don't go street legal. The Hellas are plenty bright.
