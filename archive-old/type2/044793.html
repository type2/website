Subject: Re: [T2] muffler heat shield

From: Nigel A. Skeet, Great Britain

The exhaust muffler heat shield, for the 1972-79 VW 17/18/2000 Type 2, was 
known to be available in 1999, from Just Kampers in England, priced at 
£23.50 pounds Sterling.

My Just Kampers Katalogue quotes part number JK8812, but despite the number, 
is said to be a genuine VW part.
