&gt; Re: hYDRAULIC LIFTERS ON SOLID LIFETR CAM, LOBE
&gt; PROFILES

Yikes. From what i've been told by various engine
builders (i too asked this a while back) &amp; it is
mentioned in the book &quot;building aircooled vw engines&quot;
(the redish/pink one), you can not put solid lifters
on a hydraulic cam. It wasn't the lobe profile, but
the hardness of the lobes. Apparently, the solid
lifters are harder metal than the hydraulic lobes,
causing premature cam death!
