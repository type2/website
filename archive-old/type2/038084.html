Subject: RE:  TDC &amp; BRAKES (longish)

&gt;But with mine (pancake 1700) do the notches on the fly wheel line up
&gt;with anything? Or do I simply trust the alignment of the rotor.

Steve Dolan's writeup on the type2 page is great (I didn't know the notch
lined up with the notch in the center of the hub), but what he doesn't
mention is that the notch for a bus-built fan (Porsche 914's use the same
fan but don't have that same notch) should line up with the &quot;0&quot; mark on the
plastic timing scale that should be screwed to your fan housing.  So without
the scale of if you don't know if your fan might have been replaced at some
point, you need further testing.

The most accurate, fail-safe way to find O TDC on a motor (any motor) is to
remove the #1 spark plug, stick a pencil down the hole (don't use a stub of
a pencil or it'll fall in there and you're screwed) and rotate the motor
until the pencil is pushed as far out as it will go.  Then remove the valve
cover for #1/2 side and watch the intake and exhaust valve for #1 while a
friend (or you with a really long arm) rotates the engine too and fro about
10-20 degrees.  If one of the valves is moving a bunch then you're on #3 TDC
and need to rotate the motor 360 degrees (that's not a type-o) then check it
again.  Find the point that the pencil is pushed furthest up and that is
TDC.  If you don't have the plastic timing scale, make a paint mark on the
fan/pulley to line up with the center line of the case and use that for
valves and timing (it will match up exactly with the notch on your flywheel
which you can't see in a bus without pulling the motor).  Make a smaller or
different color paint mark 180 degrees on the other side of the pulley so
you can easily find #2 and #4 TDC for doing your valves.

&gt;Also when I replace my front brakes, calipers and pads, do I also have
&gt;to bleed the rear brakes as well? (I got this feeling that the bleeder
&gt;valves on the rear will be frozen).

If you're careful when retracting the pistons in the caliper so you don't
suck in much air, you should be fine.  I always bleed the pair of brakes
(front or rear) that I have worked on just to be safe and if I have any
doubt whatsoever (or if it's been a couple of year) I bleed the whole
system.  If you just bleed the fronts, you don't need to bleed the lower
bleed valves (I've seen bus calipers with either 1 or two bleed screws) -
the lower one is used to flush all the fluid out (air rises).

&gt;I dont use my heat at all. Is it really important to have those two small
&gt;pieces of tin on both sides that screw to the block and on the bottom of
&gt;the heat exchangers..the ones that cover/block acess to the push rod tubes

Those 2 plates don't have anything to do with heat the interior of the bus.
They serve 3 purposes:
1.  (This one I'm least sure about, but never discount German engineer
unless proven wrong.)  I suspect that they either create air resistance,
help prevent a vacuum, or create a vacuum at speed that should affect the
rate of airflow coming across the cylinder heads.  If this is the case, they
are very important to the cooling of your engine.
2.  They obstruct the flow of air across your thermostat so that it will
more correctly measure engine air temp instead of outside air temp.  This
will actually have the effect of opening your cooling flaps more slowly than
without it.
3.  They help protect your vulnerable pushrod tubes from flying debris off
the street.  A small rock smacking into a pushrod tube at 60 MPH can do some
serious damage and can certainly create an oil leak.

Sorry so long-winded, but as a lot of you know, once I get on a roll there's
no stopping me!
