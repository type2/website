&gt;Well, coming home from work on Friday, it happened.  Some guy slammed
&gt;into the back of the bus at a pretty good speed:(

I'm so sorry to hear it. I hope you're OK, no whiplash or anything. If you
haven't been examined by a doctor yet I would recommend it, even if you
feel all right.

My split panelvan was rear-ended by a double-decker bus three years ago so
I know how you feel. The car was a straight, rust free van before the
crash. Lower damage was similar to your description but, because of the
height of the bus, the rear hatch was bent and the body pushed in, which
caused major creasing down the left hand side. I took the insurance cheque
(If they want to hassle about value, try to collect some classified ads for
a similar bus in similar condition for the value you want and hassle them
right back. I did and got a good deal in the end) and spent a fraction of
the money on a used rear hatch and engine cover and having the rear body
pulled out to line up with the straight doors and left it like that. It
doesn't look great, but it is roadworthy and I use it as a daily beater
wihout worrying too much about theft or collecting more dings.

I also replaced the exhaust which was cracked by the impact:
&gt;
&gt;The muffler has been flattened (that spells LOUD) and the right heat
&gt;exchanger is bent, and the tin at the right heat exchanger was popped
&gt;off.

Don't drive with a cracked muffler -- the cooling fan sucks in (hot)
exhaust fumes which will lead to overheating.

Once again, sorry to hear about your accident. Hope it all goes OK with the
new bus etc.
