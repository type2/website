Subject: small problem w/ FI

Hey Folks, 
I'm having a very small problem with the FI system in my 79 bus I'd
like to correct.  I live at the bottom of a small hill.  In the a.m.,
when leaving for work, is when my small problem occurs.
I start the bus, and release the parking brake, put it in 1st, and let off
the brake and begin to accelerate.  Problem is it hesitates big time, like
its about to stall, then regains power.  So, it regains power, I'm in
1st gear crawling up the hill, and ready for 2nd gear.
I put it in 2nd, and it does the stumble thing for 2 seconds, then back to 
full power.  By this time, I'm up the hill, and going downhill
in 3rd.  No problems the rest of the day.  Only happens on this hill
in the a.m..  What gives?  Fuel pump about to give out? Air flow meter
about to die?

Thanks
Paul
