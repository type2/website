Subject: still no start (FI '77): ideas?
Message-ID: &lt;3744DE78.2E1A_at_ibm_dot_net&gt;

I went thru my FI system for four nights this past january.
I had a very similar problem to yours - she would fire up, idle for 30
secs and then die.
I disconnected all &quot;non-essential&quot; vac lines and sealed them off - no
luck
Listening to the FI air induction after a few days made me start
thinking I had a leak, but the FI system has a certain amount of hiss to
it.

Checking the FInjectors was pretty neat - used 4 small jars - like horse
radish jars or something similar, adn watched the conical spray pattern
as my wife turned the ignition.  (Disconnect the plug wire from the coil
and put some tape over the opening in the coil)

BUT, my problem was with the cylinder head temp sensor (temp sensor 2).
I checked the reading on that sensor 20 different times, cold, hot, in
between, etc.  Always got consistant readings.
It was about 130am on a tues nite and I had just measured the resistance
on the temp sensor for the 21st time and it was correct.  I left the
meter connected to the temp sensor and connected the fuel pressure guage
again. (I really did not want to tow her into a shop).  I started the
bus and the fuel pressure was correct.  I looked at the multi meter,
which was still connected, and it was getting very erratic readings.  I
turned off the bus and the readings were still erratic.  I got a wrench
and started to tighten the sensor- it was pretty tight, so I loosened it
and retightened it - Bertha has been running beautifully ever since. 
Apparently there was some rust or corrosion build up that provided a
poor connection.

I always checked the sensor when it was sitting still, only by accident
did I check the sensor during and immediately after she was running.

good luck,

Well, I still don't have a running bus. Symptoms: tries to start then
immediately dies--that
is, she'll fire up, but only run for a second or two. Have to wait about
5 minutes between
starts.

Something interesting I discovered, when I checked the brain plug
today...I forgot to plug it
back in and the thing fired up the same as always...so I'm seeing no
difference with the brain
plugged in or removed. I have tested with a spare brain (ECU) and I
didn't see any difference.
I tested the ECU wiring harness and couldn't find anything wrong with
it. I'm wondering if it's
a wiring thing that I've done wrong somewhere. I found an interesting
post/reply in the
archives that I thought might be promising (
http://vw.i405_dot_com/sm.asp?path=\type2_at_type2\9705\115)--it spoke of a
bad ground to the
ECU--but that didn't pan out either. I ran a ground wire straight from
on of the screws on the
back of the ECU to ground with no luck whatsoever.

I have done most every test I can think of and they've all passed. I
have checked and
quadruple-checked every vacuum line, including the brake booster line.
I've racked my brain on
electrical connections and although I wonder if something's hooked up
wrong, I can't find a
problem.

I have NOT checked fuel pressure because I don't have a gauge...though
I'm thinking about
testing volume to determine if that's okay. I have, however, checked to
see if the pump runs
when I press the flap in the air flow meter and it does. I know I'm
getting pressure because I
saw it on my cold start valve when I checked the spray on that. I
haven't gotten around to
checking for fuel at my injectors, which John Anderson suggested, but I
guess I'll go do that
right now. That would be pretty stupid to omit that test in light of all
I've already tested.
And I guess that *could* be it, considering they get a signal via the
resistor block (forgot
what it's really called)--btw, I *DID* test that resistor block and it
passed too.

Please let me know if you have ideas. I'll check the injectors right
now.

Thanks! Joe
