&gt; I have heard some folks put CO detectors in their air cooled vehicles.  It's 
&gt; probably not too bad an idea.    

how true, fortunately my bus has had the entire heating system removed,
don't even have heat exchangers,  (have a home built recirculating hook up
to an eberspracher(sp))  so there is very little chance for CO to get into
the bus, even the aux heat is vented out the rear and is mounted on the
outside...
