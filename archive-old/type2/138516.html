Subject: Re: [T2] dizzy rebuild was vac dizzy help....

The image you see has not been doctored or altered by anyway and has been 
confirmed by a professional photo analyst that is authenticate. :)

Just to clarify the photo was the setup that I thought was correct but 
couldn't get it to run very well at all. Since then I did change things 
around thinking I had it screwed up before I gave up and pulled it.

Also I forgot -  I took a pic from the engine it was installed in (assuming 
of course the PO had it correct).

I'll let you know if I can free the arm and get this bad boy running 
correctly, but it will probably be this weekend. Thanks for the help.

&gt; &gt; are we looking at the same picture ray?
&gt;
&gt;Yes! This is right.  Daniel and I have been
&gt;posting offlist, and I SWEAR he posted earlier
&gt;another photo... except that now that I look at
&gt;them this morning, they seem to be exactly
&gt;opposite of what I saw yesterday.  I think he
&gt;changed the photos to make me look silly.  :)
