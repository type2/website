Subject: '71 Sportsmobile (Partsmobile ?)

Hi Volks,
        Well, I got 'Molly', my '74 Sportsmobile running and a new clutch
disc and engine seal should arrive today, so she should be on the road soon.
Dropping the engine wasn't as big a deal as I thought it would be, since I'd
never done it before (on any car) -- I was pleasantly surprised how easy it
is to manhandle and manuever to get it where you want it.  Hopefully,
installation will be as easy. :)
        Anyhow, to the subject of this message -- A week or so ago, I bought
a '71 Sportsmobile, with the idea in mind that I could use it as a parts
car.  However, after close inspection of the body and frame, I'm not sure
what to do.  The frame/floorpan is in great shape, having been Ziebarted
previously, and the wheelwells are full of nice shiny paint -- only small
dabs of surface rust where the crossmembers join the wheelwell.  There are a
couple of sizable rust spots here and there (2&quot; x 3&quot;) and a big one on the
sliding door from where something was sideswiped (the door works fine and
the track isn't rusty at all -- the dent could be pulled by someone who
knows how).  There are a couple of sizable holes in the rocker panels,
towards the back, but the metal underneath is solid -- a piece of panel from
RMMW would fix them up good as new.  Also, the 2&quot; wide panel under the door
track is completely gone, which I don't understand since the rest of the
body is good!?  The PO ran into a horse (no injuries to the driver or horse
fortunately), so the upper left nose area, below the left windshield wiper
is pretty banged up.  The pop-top needs new canvas, and a new piece of
aluminum (when popped, the whole top floats side to side).  The interior is
pretty beat (all that's left is the the closet on the right behind the
sliding door, the storage nooks on the right hand rear area, the foldout bed
and the rear cushion), but all the metal is nice and new where I ripped out
the trashed kickboards and such.  The dash is missing little pieces and the
fusebox is hanging (not mounted at present, and missing about 5 fuses.  I
tried to turn it over, but I don't think the electrical system is in great
shape since I don't hear anything but a click when I turn the key.  I'm
going to try to hot wire it by applying some power directly to the starter
to see if the engine will run.  The fuel and vaccuum lines are not attached,
but I think I can fudge it by comparing it to my '74 (both Solex) enough for
it to run (if it wants to &lt;G&gt;)
        Is there anything else I need to connect by hand in order to hot
wire this thing?  It seems like all I should have to hook up is a direct
line to the coil and a direct line to the starter.  If this is wrong, please
let me know.  I won't try it until I get a 'go for it' response from
someone, since I don't want to chance cooking something! ;)
        I guess I just don't know what should be done.  I know that it would
need lots of work and money to get going (even little parts - it needs all
four side light lenses and the two lower turn signal lenses, which in itself
is a pretty hefty sum), but I feel so bad for it because it does have a
perfectly useable frame and body (I've seem much worse as daily drivers!),
and the engine might even run, but I just don't have the experience and
money to spend on *two* buses.  As I mentioned, 'Molly' is just about
roadworthy, but I still need to spend some money here and there for alot of
little things (ie. seat covers, new RMMW sliding door track, carpet to redo
the inside, and misc. tubing for the sink).  *Also*, I need some parts from
the '71 to get Molly in good shape (the sliding door lower roller, passenger
side front window, antenna, dimmer switch for dash lights, and in the
future, a windshield - mine is getting milky along the edges) and other
parts would be nice just to have around as spares (CV's, steering
components, and goodness knows what else)  All in all, if I were to remove
these from the '71, it might no longer be worth restoring.  It would have
been an easy decision if the '71 had been rolled over or was missing windows
or something, but its fairly complete.  Help!  What should I do?
