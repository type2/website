Subject: Re: [T2] Tranny bushings, linkages, adjustments?

Billy,

Whooo! What an opening&lt;grin&gt;.

I have no idea how long or short.  Since I suspect that it is just a 
locator &quot;device&quot; I suspect that it might not matter.

But!, I am still not happy with my shift linkage and am wondering how to 
grease those 3 plastic &quot;carriers&quot; in the tube.....any hints from anyone on 
this????

Cheers, dave

&gt; Okay, so this tunnel is obviously why the rear shift rod cannot be pulled so easily as the front. It all makes sense now.
&gt; 
&gt; Didn't you (Karl?) mention modifying the new bushings to fit typical to the older ones? My shifting has been terrible.
&gt; 
&gt; One more question, please. The ball on the bottom of the shifter has a little 
protrusion apparently to line it up/maintain alignment in the cup of the front shift rod that it falls into.
&gt; 
&gt; My protrusion seems too short.
&gt; 
&gt; Did I just say that?
&gt; 
&gt; How long should the protrusion be?
&gt; 
&gt; Go easy on me.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;The rear rod goes thru a &quot;tunnel&quot;(a pipe).  The 2 bellows are on each end of the pipe and seal the tunnel from the elements while the rod goes in at the front and out in the rear.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;This tunnel/pipe is what the bushings ride inside of to help keep the rod centered in the tunnel.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Front and rear couple together in the front and then the rear goes 
&gt; &gt;straight thru to the rear tranny coupler.
