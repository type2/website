Subject: Re: SC/DC Bed Dimensions

Rick / List -

I hear you on the full-sized American truck campers, but I'm looking at a
couple of mini-truck campers that look like a snug (or, at least, snugger)
fit.

It looks to me that there must be a maximum footprint (in the bed) that the
camper manufacturer's use, because the footprint on these two look slightly
different. I'll get the measuring tape out this W/E to get an accurate
dimension.

Also, the SC/DC's have a completely flat bed, yes? Which means I should have
room on the sides of the camper and the sides of the SC/DC for stuff, no?

Anyway, if someone has the numbers, I'd appreciate it.

Thanks -

&gt; &gt;If you imagine needing the dimensions to mount a regular pick-up truck
&gt; &gt;camper on the back of a SC/DC, those are the ones I need.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; I don't think you will like the results.  The distance from the bottom of
&gt; the bed where the camper sits, to the top of the cab where the overhang on
&gt; the camper protrudes on an American truck is a lot different than a VW.
If
&gt; you sit a camper on the bed of a VW, the overhang will be 2 feet above the
&gt; top of the cab!!  I don't know about your taste, but I think that would
&gt; look odd.
