I have a set of new ATE sodium filled 34 mm exhaust valves for a 1974 1800
Type 4.   The VW part number is 021 109 611A.  The ATE number on the valve is
390374.  The divot in the center of the valve face is there.

RMMW list a standard 1974 1800 CC  34mm exhaust valve as PN 022 109 612A for
$13.95

&gt; My only reference says the sodiums are 021 109 611 or 611A
&gt; and lists all 022xxx612x series PN's as regular steel valves.

Hope this helps,

By the way, anyone want to buy a set of sodium filled valves?  $175 for the
set.  I won't break the set.  They cost too much to replace.
