Sorry everyone~
I'm located just south of Mpls., MN.  Is there something I can pick up at a 
Wal-Mart or a commercial-like place that will have 6-ply?  I've found that's 
what I need.  I located a guy who can get Yokohams's, but it would take a 
few days; and like I mentioned earlier, I should get something as quick as I 
can as I found my spare to be kinda shotty.

Thanks again,
Chet
