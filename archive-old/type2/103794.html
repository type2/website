&gt;Ever since, I have had a problem with the running of the van after about
&gt;one hour of running. The revs will suddenly drop right off, sometimes cutting
&gt;out but often just idling. I have to pull off the road very quckly. The 
&gt;accelerator
&gt;pedal has no effect on revs. If I turn the engine off and wait 10 minutes,
&gt;she will get going again and run for approx 45 mins.

Sounds like a fuel starvation problem to me.  Start with the fuel tank 
(remove, clean &amp; line
with POR-15 fuel tank kit), replace sleeve filter in fuel tank (&amp; new 
gasket seal), replace
rubber fuel lines (clean out metal ones) and filter, rebuild fuel pump 
(CHECK LENGTH
OF OPERATING ROD!!!!! as well as pressure and delivery volume), rebuild 
carburetor(s).
You will now have a &quot;new&quot; fuel system.  If this doesn't do it, you will 
KNOW the
problem lies elsewhere.

&gt;The engine is extremely hot - pinging tinware, no way of holding dipstick
&gt;etc. I have changed oil several times.

Why is this?  Are all tinware and engine seals in place, and in working order?
Are there blockages in the cooling air circulation system?  What is the 
compression ratio
of your engine?  What octane level is the gas you run?  Deal with this 
first.  Carbs. aren't
designed to run when the gas is boiling.

&gt;I look like I might lose a summer unless I can fix it.

Get fixin'.  8o)
