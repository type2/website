Travis,

Were  these readings taken with the same meter? Same altitude? Same carbs (wide
open)? Exact same valve lash (temperature and/or oil viscosity may affect the
lash in a hydraulic lifter)? Same RPM's while cranking?

All of these outside factors (and others I can't think of right now) can affect
compression readings and cause them to change across the board, as it appears
yours have (done, with the exception of #2). I don't think there's a dramatic
difference here. 5 PSI is certainly within calibration, operator, or equipment
error.  A significant difference between cylinders doesn't tell you as much on
our air-cooled engines as it would on a water cooled, only that the compression
is different. 100 PSI is approaching the low end, and could well begin to
affect your emissions testing (if you're so lucky), but won't keep her from
running like a champ  ;-)

When all available data conflicts with test results, doubt the test.
