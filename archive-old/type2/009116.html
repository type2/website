    $500 if pre-80 or $600 post-80. The vehicle must be currently
    registered. The vehicle must move under its own power forward and
    reverse.

OK, so the price point is that a vehicle that
can move under its own power forward and reverse
is worth rock bottom $500.

Uh, is there a bus anywhere that actually runs
and yet is not worth $500 in parts?  

I don't grok the economics of this unless these
vehicles have already been relieved of every 
detachable thing that doesn't interfere with
running &quot;under its own power forward and reverse&quot;
or they are little more than a huge wad of duct tape.
