Subject: minimum compression

Doc,

Been waiting for you to come back!...I have a question!

What if the head compression ratio has been lowered.  Would the 100psi 
minimum then change?

An additional question...if a leak down test showed practically no leak 
down, and the compression was still 100 psi or lower, what would be your 
thoughts on that?

The engine in question runs well, pushes a baywindow to 80mph and gets 
20+mpg on the hiway...and uses practically no oil...

Just wondering....

Cheers, dave

&gt; Absolutely, good focus. Who assembled the motor?? What type of motor and 
&gt; what was the cost?? If memory serves, compression at 100psi is under 
&gt; minimum spec for a T-IV motor. Honor that fact, regardless emotions.
