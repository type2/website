Subject: Re: [T2] Late Bay Kombi brochure

&gt; Does anyone out there have a VW brochure showing a
&gt; Kombi fitted with a middle front seat?
&gt; It's the ones that go between the driver and
&gt; passenger seat over the walk
&gt; through section.
&gt; If so, could I get a copy of the page showing the
&gt; picture.

Sorry for my late reply on this (it was posted on
09-feb).

Do you have the book Original Volkswagen from Laurence
Meredith? It shows this option of having a walkthru
bus but with three seats in the cabin (this option
makes no sense to me but it was available as M501).
The picture is on page 93. It is actually a very rare
option and so far I have only seen it for real in the
bus pictured in this book.

Do your road authorities give you so much trouble on
this?


yours,


Vincent
