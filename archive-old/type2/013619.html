Subject: Fan Shroud/Alternator Q?
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Yes, it's me, Alabama Pete, back on the list again
from an extended hiatus.  I'm still in Colorado
driving my '78 baby.  Hello to new and old friends
alike.

Anyway, I started what I thought was going to be a
routine alternator swap yesterday, to find out both of
the brackets where broken.  The lower pivot bracket
was competely broken and the adjustment bracket was
cracked.  The kicker is where the adjustment bracket
attaches to the fan/cooling shroud.  The nut holding
the adj. bracket to the shroud had loosened about half
way and the bracket had eaten a third of the bolt
away.  So I've got to replace the bolt, from the
inside of the fan shroud.  Is this a standard bolt? 
Can I simply pull the back half (back is back) of the
shroud off and get to said bolt?

Any and all tips, suggestions, anecdotes welcome...
