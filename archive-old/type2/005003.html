&gt;Just a thought about ez outs... DONT BUY CHEAP ONES !!!


I'll second that one.  If you thought drilling a neat hole in the middle of
a stuck bolt to get the ez out started was interesting, just wait for the
spiritual experience you'll have getting the snapped off ez out out.  I've
done it, but the lesson I mostly learned was this:  the ez out is a last
resort after you screwed up (ask me how many times I've repeated the lesson)
and snapped off the bolt.

Listen to your hands.  They'll often be screaming the information that the
bolt is about to fail if you're being careful and listening.

I use heat a lot more than I used to, parafin sucked in to the threads and
tapping on the bolt.  It takes longer than I want it to, but it's amazing
how often it works.
