Subject: RE: [T2] Brand New Front Doors

&gt; I'm not a prospective buyer, but I have two questions nonetheless.
&gt;
&gt; 1. Which model exactly?  '69-'73 didn't have the door locking pin
&gt;    hole in the rear lower corner of the window, and '77 (I think)
&gt;    to '79 had different hinges.  I thisk there were such things
&gt;    as adapters for new doors to old hinges, or vice versa,
&gt;    though.
&gt; 2. Are these really the European style?  Mexican and Brazilian
&gt;    Baywindow Buses I've seen have a ridge embossed a short way
&gt;    above the lower edge of the door skin.
&gt;
&gt; Ron: Please do not regard this as an attack against you or
&gt; your business.  I think it's in both your and your customers'
&gt; interest to know what they're about to buy --
&gt; In other words: No offence meant!


And none taken.  Both are very good questions.  I will pose them to the
distributor and post their response to the list.
