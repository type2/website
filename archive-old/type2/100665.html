Subject: RE: [T2] pop top canvas a little small

&gt; OK, since all the vendors seem to get their canvas pop tops from the same
&gt; manufacturer, wouldn't it be nice if SOME ONE TOLD this single
&gt; source that they are cutting their canvas pop tops  SMALL ? ? ?


Actually, I have.  I spoke directly to the &quot;top banana&quot; in charge of
production.  But he adamantly insists that they are using an exact duplicate
of the original Westfalia pattern, and have been for 20 years, and that it
is therefore impossible for their canvas to be smaller than the original. I
have thought of simply asking him to make mine a little bigger anyway, even
if he feels that they would be &quot;wrong&quot; that way.  But there seems to be no
clear consensus among customers/listmembers as to which direction could
stand to be slightly bigger - the width of the front panel, or its height,
or both. (Comments?)

I have one commercial customer who routinely buys Vanagon canvases for use
on '74-79 busses. They are slightly larger in every dimension, and he feels
that they fit a bus a bit better.  Of course, no similar alternative is
available for owners of pre-1974 busses or Vanagons.
