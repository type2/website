Subject: re: VDO oil temp sender drain plug, Redux

I don't think I've ever looked at my sender mounted in
the plate with the strainer on top, like your photo. 
On my 1600 bug, I always take out the sender first, to
drain the oil, and then put it back in last, after the
plate's bolted back on - so screwing the sender into
the plate probably just pushes the bottom of the
strainer up automatically (like the EMPI people told
you to do with your fingers).

Having said that, I've never noticed that the bottom
of the strainer is bent in any way, and also, I'm sure
my sender doesn't look quite as tall as yours
(although it's in the car, so I'm relying on a
rapidly-failing memory ;-)  Do they make more than one
model of sender that would fit this application? Or is
it possible they put the wrong one in the package?
(sorry - mine's 10 years old - don't know the model #)

Matthew
