Dr. Tim &amp; all who responded,

     Thanks for the advise.  Since my goal is the most reliable &amp; breakdown
free car possible, I bought new CV's.  I may have been able to make those
last but with my luck they would have failed catastrophically.  Probably in
the middle of nowhere in the lovely Oregon rain.  No thank you.  My garage
is dry &amp; my other car is available for parts running.  Thanks again.  BTW,
the new joint kit had the new circle clips.
