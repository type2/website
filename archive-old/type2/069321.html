Subject: Re: Removing door panels II (fixing the window)

Okay, everyone's advice was great! I got the door panels off and tried to fix the window crank. So far I have 
been unsuccessful. Time for more advice. Here's the problem:

One day I was rolling the window down (or up I can't remember) on my '68 bus and it stuck. I tried applying 
more pressure and the handle gave way with kind of a grinding noise but the window didn't move. When I got the 
door apart I found a tube connecting the door crank and the actual window mechanism. It looks like I can't get 
the crank mechanism out without taking out the whole window. I looked through RMMW and it looks like the thing 
I need is called a &quot;door regulator&quot; however they didn't have one for a bus only a bug. I'd like to be able to 
fix the one I've got but I don't know if that's possible. It looks all sealed, like it was welded or press fit 
together. Any advice???
