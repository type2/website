&gt;bus, but I was thinking that it might  defrost your windshield.  I used to

I think the reason that happened is that there was another thread about an
electric heater going on at the same time.  I bought one of those ceramic
heaters from JC Whipme a long time ago and found that it defrosted about a
2x4&quot; area on my windshield, so technically it works, but practically, it's
useless.  Useless for heating the bus, useless for defrosting.
