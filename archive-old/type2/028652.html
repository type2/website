&gt;?hello all,

&gt;I have been searching for an inexpensive way to
insulate the roof of my
&gt;standard...


This reminds me.

Does anyone know if the fibers inside a Westy pop
top
are flame retardent asbestos? If not what are they
made of.
I've been sleeping under this stuff for a while
and noticed that
a lot of it has flaked off into the cabin.
