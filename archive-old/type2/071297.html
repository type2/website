Michael and the List,

Sounds similar to my '72.  The opening on my '72, also made from a 
non-sunroof delux (station wagon) bus, goes from the leading edge of the 
sliding door back to about the middle of the rear side window.  It also goes 
side to side approximately as wide as the sunroof opening would have been.  
The cutout is reinforced with an angle iron brace that goes all the way 
around.  For the top bunk, I have two six foot long cots that roll up on each 
side when not in use.  The neat thing about this conversion is that you have 
a feeling of tremendous space inside (when the cots are not in use) due to 
the larger opening.  I will try to get some pictures up on my website 
sometime soon.
 
I would be very interested to hear  from anyone else who may have one of 
these conversions.
