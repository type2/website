Subject: RE: [T2] decibel

I'm really interested in hearing if someone has used this product,  
too.  I have the interior of my bus stripped out with the exception  
of the paneling on the walls which I just haven't gotten around to  
removing.  After the body work gets done I'm going to tackle the  
sound issue, as I remember how loud it was when driving all day from  
SF to Chicago.  You really had to crank the stereo up.  And since it  
was a stripped out Kombi with only a back seat and cardboard for  
carpeting, it was *loud* even with a stock exhaust.

&gt; Hi Stan,
&gt;
&gt; Haven't used it yet (planning to this winter) but there was a recent
&gt; thread on Quiet Car http://quietcar_dot_net/
&gt;
&gt; It seemed to get a lot of good reviews.
