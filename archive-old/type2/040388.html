Subject: camping tent question

I recently picked up a 9 x 13 screened gazebo.  It is
great!  I set it up right next to the bus, put the
picnic table in there, was having a grand old time. 
My question is.  Is there anyone out there that has
had any success in &quot;rigging&quot; the tent so that it
attaches directly to the bus?  This has a zipper that
zips down the middle. I would like to attach directly
to the side.  Thanks for any help

peas,

Rich Racioppa
