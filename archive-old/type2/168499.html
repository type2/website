Subject: Re: Starting problems with 78 2L FI

Also, wondering if because I am feeding the coil directly from the battery
for testing, does this not feed the FI system, and that's why it will only
run with the starting fluid? Is there another wire I have to power?

Thanks,

Ned

&gt; Hey all,
&gt;
&gt; Sent the note below last week. Got back up to the bus the other day and
&gt; changed out the pertronix to the points. No start. We then tested the coil,
&gt; and found pretty large resistance readings which were out of the normal with
&gt; the Bentley manual. We changed out the coil today, and it wouldn't start. We
&gt; found low voltage from the reverse light feed (I think that's what its for).
&gt; Cleaned all contacts, and still couldn't get consistent readings, or
&gt; consistent spark. As for spark, mostly it would spark on initial starting,
&gt; but no more, and then again once I let the key off. We cleaned contacts on
&gt; that and replaced some of the connectors, but still no consistent spark or
&gt; voltage at coil. We then took a direct line off of the battery to the coil,
&gt; and we were able to achieve consistent spark and get her to fire over (with
&gt; starter fluid). I drew some gas out, and it does smell a bit like varnish,
&gt; but I had put stabilizer in before I put her away. My plan is to drain the
&gt; remainder of the fuel and replace with fresh, but I'm wondering if anyone
&gt; can see an holes in my logic, maybe something I'm missing.
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
&gt; Ned
