Subject: Re: [T2] bug battery~apology

i am SOOOOOOO sorry... i didn't realize that was a private e-mail until
AFTER i sent it back to the group... i am just used to hitting reply and
then having to change the &quot;send to&quot; address to T2, that i didn't even
look at who the e-mail was sent to (from Kate to ME, not to the group).
if original message says &quot;To: type2_at_type2_dot_com&quot; but i hit &quot;reply&quot;, it goes
to the person's e-mail that wrote the post, so i have to delete that and
select T2 from my address book. i didn't notice that it said &quot;To:
myangelmorgan_at_juno_dot_com&quot;

is there any way to change that? is it a setting somewhere? everyone else
seems to send a duplicate e-mail to the list AND the sender (any time
people reply to me, i get two copies of it), but mine only goes to the
sender. it gets annoying having to change that all the time, and
especially when i forget to. my yahoo groups send to the groups when i
hit reply, FMBC sends to the group when i hit reply... how do i get it to
do it for THIS group?

thanks, and sincerest apologies again for the bug thing,
Chris
