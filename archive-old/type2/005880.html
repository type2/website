While none of my VW's have done this, I have had it happen on non - VW's.
The symptom is the rear brake shoes glazing and chattering, due to excess
heat.  You may notice that this problem is at it's worst during or after a
long and/or hard stop.  Sometimes, it is due to undersized brakes, but
often, it a due to a malfunctioning proportioning valve, which is causing
the rears to assume too much of the braking load.

Slowly reemerging after EveryBus. I will get to that in another post.

The bus in question is a 1972 Westy with the standard 72 brake setup:
front disk brakes with vacuum power assist.

When applying the brakes the pedal is pulsing. Typically this would
be indicative of warped disk rotors. However in the case the pulsing
is not consistent. In fact, there are times when braking is smooth
and silky. The pulsing seems to come and go. Some trips start out
with a pulsing pedal and end smoothly while others start out smoothly
and end with a pulsing pedal. A dial caliper has not been applied to
situation to test the disks but perhaps soon.

Could this be a brake servo related problem? BTW, the servo seems to
work and there is no brake fluid loss from the system. Braking is
straight and well within acceptable distance. Just the other day I
looked them up to avoid certain disaster.

Thanks
