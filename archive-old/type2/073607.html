Subject: Re: howdy, and some questions

thanks guys!
I really appreciate your thoughts

Yea I've had mixed luck removing the CV joints too.
Last time I replaced a pair of boots the joints slipped
off fairly easily.
My CV's are knocking so since I two good looking
spare half axles i'm replacing mine with the spares.
The problem is with these spares I have;
one axle both CV joints came of easily (by hand)
and on the other axle there sticking.
I have to replace the boots on these spares so
only removing one CV on each axle works :)

I guess I'd just stop by NAPA or the likes and
get them removed.

As for the press I was just hoping a small arbor
press would work,  but as a few of you told me
thats not going to cut it. Glad I asked before i
went and bought one though.

thanks again
Alex
