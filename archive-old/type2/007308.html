&gt; Can the oil cooler be removed/replaced with the &gt;engine in the car? What all has to come off?

tim -

yes it can, but it's not fun. i'm assuming you have a 2.0 pancake.

if you really want to do it w/the engine in (and i've done this *twice*), first disconnect the battery. you'll need to loosen the engine tin where it attaches to the fan shroud and take out the engine tin all around the front of the engine (nearest the bumper) along w/the oil filler tube. if your thermostat is still intact, loosen the connection to the cooling flaps. disconnect the alternator, as it will come out w/the shroud. loosen and remove the belt, remove the fan, and then the big 'ol fan shroud is ready to come out (i *think* that's everything...look around). leave the shroud housing together rather than splitting it (4 bolts only). once it's out, which takes some cursing &amp; persuading, you can access the oil cooler.

if it's really pouring out, chances are it wasn't installed properly. consult your favorite manual for exact instructions. make sure there's no crud where the oil cooler seals seat, and get all those washers in the right place. in all my searching, i've never found an actual torque value for tightening those three nuts, so i just wrench away until the cooler firmly presses the seals, but not so much that it distorts them. don't use *any* sealant on those gaskets!

you can check for leaks before you reassemble by turning the engine over for a few seconds w/the distributor disconnected (coil wire off)...this will reveal only major leaks as the oil is still pretty thick, but better than nothing.

reinstallation is opposite removal, though getting the shroud back in around the engine support bar can be, well, tricky. putting a jack under the engine to take the weight off the bar helps a little. 

hope this helps, let me know how it goes.
