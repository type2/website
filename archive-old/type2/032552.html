Subject: RE: Battery drain...

I was having a devil of a time tracking down a current leak on our 1970 
Campmobile that only kicked in when the lights were on.

I finally determined that it still existed when only the parking lights were 
on, thus eliminating the headlights as suspects.

After a lot more checking and head scratching I discovered that the left front 
parking/turn signal lens had a hairline crack on top.  As soon as I loosened 
the lens screws about a cup of water poured out.  Bingo!  

Examination of the inside of the lens showed a waterline just below the top of 
the lens.  The lens is opaque enough that the water inside wasn't obvious from 
outside.  The whole assembly had been functioning submerged for a long time. 

Mystery solved.....
