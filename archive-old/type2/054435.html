Well, in reality you set timing, then idle, then timing, then idle, and so
on until everything is right.  It therefore doesn't really matter which
parameter you set first.
 
&gt; 2) muir notes checking vacuum advance is done by sucking the tube from the
&gt; air intake distributor to the dizzy. the plate the points are on should
&gt; then move. i get no movement, nada. if no movement, muir says change points
&gt; and condensor. is there any more to it then that?

When you suck, do you get a continuous flow of air, or does it feel like
you're sucking on a closed container?

If you get a continuous flow, your diaphragm can needs replacing.  If not,
and the point plate doesn't move then it is stuck and you need to find out
why.

The points and condensor are just along for the ride, so they don't affect
the advance.
