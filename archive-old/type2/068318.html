Subject: Re: Busses and horns...

&gt; Do people really use horns?  Like most VW busses, I don't even know if mine

I _do_ use mine - my '68 bus' horn sounds wonderful !

&gt; works, or what it sounds like.  By the time I need a horn, I'm too busy
&gt; trying to drive the bus to worry about expressing indignation.

Funny isn't it that you associate the hon with the expression of
indignation...surely it is used more frequently as a warning, greeting
or apology?  I know it is where I live...

&gt; 
&gt; Most of the time I hear horns is in traffic.  Do they expect the cars in
&gt; front of them to evaporate or something?  I admit that sometimes I think about
&gt; honking when the sleepy fellow in front of me fails to notice the light
&gt; change, but driving a VW for years, I get used to not-moving more than moving
&gt; sometimes.

Just because the modern road user tends to be in a rush ALL the time -
doesn't mean that we do too...
 
&gt; When my horn did work, I'd have to pound on that little plastic button
&gt; hard, with verve and gusto!  &quot;Bee(p)&quot;.  Better not get too excited, there,
&gt; I might attract some more mice with that squeak!
&gt; 

Reminds me of a way cool Freaks Brothers cartoon I read once...

&gt; Where I live, we don't have any stoplights.  People leave their keys in the
&gt; ignition while parked at the store.  I don't think I've heard a horn except
&gt; to try to coerce some poor bovine off the tarmac (doesn't phase 'em).  So
&gt; you worldwide net community, here's the question:  Does your horn work, and
&gt; what is it for?
&gt; 

See above!
