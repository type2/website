I agree with Bob. Keep it in the family. Any Rabbit/Golf/Jetta etal in good
order can be superb stop and go or highway transport, and the philosophy of
design is no different than the air cooleds. Just get the Bentley and
owner's manual for what ever model you acquire and follow instructions as
best you can. A 412 seems ideal, but they can be few and far between, not
easy to find a suitable candidate. A T-III in good order is rarely for sale. 

Find the best condition chassis you can being liquidated due to bad
motor/trans ect., fix it. Use it. Maintain it. Pass it on to your prodigy
when he/she heads to college in a rare proper functioning vehicle. Or keep
it and send them off in the Champagne Edition Westfalia that they spent all
those vacations with you in.

If you get a Japanese rice burner, use it up, just know that if you buy a
typical example with 150K there is poor probability that you will make 200K
before spendy problems develop. Then you will have to address a learning
curve of a wholly different philosophy of design, i.e. throw it away, and
get another.
