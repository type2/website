  I screwed up on putting the link for the bus fire in, here it goes 
again: 
 http://www.westhawaiitoday_dot_com/news/docs/news3.shtml

It'll only be there until the next paper comes out for tomorrow 
(Wednesday)
 
On other subjects, we owned a F_at_rd truck when we were in Wyoming that 
had two VIN # plates because it had been rolled, the rolled body had 
been removed and a junked one put on. The junked VIN was not usable in 
Wyoming so the VIN plate from the rolled body had been pop riveted in 
next to the original. It took some explaining when we transferred the 
title! They had to run the junk VIN on the police computer to make sure 
it was junked and not stolen. I'd hate to try and register a VW in a 
place like Cali with the same setup! If I recall they really scrutinized 
the VIN when you tried to title one there.

Also, I always thought the T4 engine case was magnesium not aluminum, 
that's why we could sacrificially burn them at Glamis on Thanksgiving!
