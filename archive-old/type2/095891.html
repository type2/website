Subject: Re: [T2] push tube rod seal replacement

My goodness.......I would take $240 for that job all day long1  I could make
$1000 per day!

On a type 4 engine it is a piece of cake.  You will need valve cover
gaskets, too, and if you really are picky, you may need access to a few new
or good used adjusting screws for the valves.

Set the valves per the article on www.bostonengine_dot_com

Subject: [T2] push tube rod seal replacement


Well, after reading the responses to my oil consumption post I couldn't help
but wonder why I was having to add oil.
I had the bus checked out.  I need new push rod tube seals.  The mechanic
wanted $240 to replace them.  Since they cost about $0.40 each I think I am
going to attempt this one myself.  This will be the 1st time I do any real
work on my engine.  I have manuals ready and another person to read them to
me.  Is there anything else I should look at or replace while in there?  Any
other seals or gaskets I will need?  I know I will need to replace the valve
cover gaskets, but what else?  Any recommendations?  Anything to be
emphasized?

Peace,
