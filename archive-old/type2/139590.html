Tony,

Same thing when &quot;they&quot; figured out that the same thing about refrigerators 
in the late 50's as well....I mean, how many ways can you make a box that 
makes things cold...

BTW, there is actually a person named &quot;They&quot; who lives in Missouri...he 
changed his name legally....NPR did a segment on him about a month ago and 
it was hilarious!

It is now proper English to say &quot;They is here.&quot;..LOL!

TGIF!

Cheers, dave

&gt; &lt;&lt; Who ever invented model years? they're too confusing. &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; FWIW, try getting a copy of Vance Packard's &quot;The Waste
&gt; Makers&quot; for an interesting study of the growth of &quot;model
&gt; years&quot; particularly by American cars in the fifties and
&gt; sixties...There really was no reasonable excuse for mak-
&gt; ing new models every year for a car that had no substantial
&gt; engineering changes. It was a marketing strategy to make
&gt; last year's car look so, well, last  year... ;-(
