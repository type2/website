My original '73 engine had an air pump.  It was used in the
emissions equipment to help the exhaust afterburner work.
In so many words it was a smog pump - not much good for pumping
up a flat tire.

Good grief, all this chat about the lazy man's way to fix a flat!
I say just carry two spare tires and a bike pump just in case.
