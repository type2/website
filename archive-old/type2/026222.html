	&gt; I've got a 69 bus that I bought to use for parts for another bus I
had.
	&gt; It's a sunroof bus, has front seats and a rear seat, no middle
seat.  The
	&gt; body is decent on it.  The glass is complete, doors are good,
hatch and
	&gt; engine decklid is good, has dash and steering column, front end,
no engine
	&gt; or trans.  I'm asking $300.00 but am open to offers.  I'm in
Hesperia,
	&gt; California.  I could deliver it within a 100 miles or so for
expenses.  I
	&gt; can email pictures, email me if you are interested in seeing them
or have
	&gt; any questions.

This Bus is actually a '70 based on the side marker lights.  It looks too
good to go to the crusher. 

Let me take a little poll here.  Does anyone own a '70 sunroof bus that IS
NOT Savanna Beige?  I'm starting to feel like my '70 sunroof Bus is the most
common version on the planet.  The up side to that is that I should be able
to find the one year only brown interior parts I need.
