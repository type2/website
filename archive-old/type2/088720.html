Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch Plate

&gt; More questions...my engines is out and the clutch is apart.  My &quot;clutch
&gt; failure&quot; was actually due to a melted pilot bearing which sort of welded
the
&gt; input shaft to the crankshaft.  I noticed the input shaft has a little bit
&gt; of radial play...is this normal or acceptable?  The tranny worked fine
prior
&gt; to clutch problem.
&gt;

Oh man, I had the same thing happen. I had to chisel my pilot bearing out
:-)

&gt; Also, my clutch plate looks ok but is worn to about 2/16&quot; above the
rivets.
&gt; The book says the minimum is 1/16&quot;  I can't find a spec for what a new
&gt; clutch plate would have.  Should I buy a new clutch plate?  How much life
&gt; might be left in my old clutch plate?
&gt; The flywheel and pressure plate look and feel smooth...is it good practice
&gt; to re-use these parts based on smoothness?

They also have wear limits. As long as all the teeth in the preasure plate
are good and they still have spring then its probably ok to use. Did the
clutch &quot;skip&quot; like a thump thump thump when accellerating? If so the
flywheel might need to be turned. But the advice on the clutch disc is to
replace it. Its fairly cheap.. and if you dont plan on having the engine out
soon might as well right?
I bead blasted my flywheel. but otherwise it was fine.  When I first bought
the bus it had that thump thump thump syndrome.. Now its gone :-) But I
replaced the pressure plate and the clutch disc.


&gt;
