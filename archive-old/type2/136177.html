Subject: Euro-Spec engine tin FS-Upright engine in a late bay bus

Hey Y'all,
I have the piece of tin you need in order to put an
upright T1 engine into your 72 or later bay window. 
This is the big one-piece tin that was used from the
factory for South American(?) and other foreign
late-70's buses that still carried the 1600 enigne. As
opposed to the pancake engines on the US spec buses.
So, anyway, who wants it??  I honestly don't know how
much these are worth or going for, but I DO know that
there are people who want them!! So make me a fair
offer, and its yours.  I also need convertible karmann
ghia parts and a few convertible bug parts, so if you
have any you'd like to trade for the tin, let me know!

=====
Peace, John Baker
