I went home on a trailer too!!

Getting ready to pull the engine this morning...but I need to know what year 
flex plate I can use. My bus is a 77 auto tranny. I think I need the 76-79 
flex plate, but I have been offered several flex plates from air cooled 
Vanagons. Will this work? A friend told me the bolts were &quot;at an angle&quot; on 
the Vanagons, but I don't know much about the Vanagon.

Once again if anybody has a flex plate I could really use it as this is my 
only vehicle. I believe I have a line on a torque converter if I should need 
it.

Thanks again,

Rob Henley
