Subject: deformed Westy top

Howdy all,

My '71 Westy's top is warped in the front, and
therefore does not seal well there.  The rest of the
top is fine, including the canvas.  I doubt there is
any way to effectively fix this warped area, so I am
wondering what price (if any) is fair for a '68-72
forward popping top in decent shape?  Or, conversely,
has anyone tried to fit a Sportsmobile Penthouse top
from Andrews, Indiana (located to the rear of the bus,
pops straight up) onto a Westy?  I may have access to
a Penthouse top, in decent shape.

Any info or experience is appreciated.

thanks

Blake
