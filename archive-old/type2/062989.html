&gt;      rear engines apparently out of a golf (rabbit) or something similar.
&gt;      They have a radiator mounted on the front panel. I've seen an official
&gt;      flyer with one of these suckers on.
&gt; 
Now something else I just noticed on my last trip down to Mexico
that the water pumping bays have along with a redesigned
dash and interior, are real neat black rubber form fitting &quot;euro?&quot;
style bumpers.  Sure would be neat to pick up a set, suggestions
anyone?
