Subject: Folly's status

The first real day of working on Folly's heart is over.  Thanks for the 
many replies and encouragement.  It has been fun.  Also... my spelling 
is horrible.  I do have an education, I just can't type!!!

All the tin is off... the water AND oil drained.  I have even been able 
to remove all the studs/bolts from one side of the motor. The left side 
actually.  Remember, FRONT is FRONT.  :-&gt;

Sunda I'll work on the other side.  I want to remove the muffler system 
so I can have a crack at the heads.

Things are going in to bags tomorrow !

In my spare time I've looked at Folly's body.  There are those panels 
that have to go and today I discovered that about the last couple of 
inches of the rocker panels are soft.  Is this a huge worry. The rest of 
the rocker panel is SOLID.  Folly had a z-bart treatment some time in 
the past!

There you go... I'm off to the shower.  Thanks again everyone.

Oh yeah... should I be able to move that flywheel thing by hand if the 
plugs are out cause I haven't been able to get it to budge.
