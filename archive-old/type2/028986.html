Subject: Tires -- Costco, Kirkland

I stopped by Costco today.  They sell a 6 ply &quot;c&quot; rated all season 195/75R14
tire under the name &quot;Kirkland&quot;.  Salesman said they are manufactured at a
Uniroyal plant (owned by Michelin), and the tire did seem a lot like the
Uniroyal Laredo.

I compared the tread etc to the Michelin LTX M/S nearby, and it was fairly
close in style, with a little more siping on the Michelin, and a solid
centre tread on the &quot;Kirkand&quot;.  About the same tread depth.  Kirkland was
blackwall both sides, quite plain, which I find attractive in a VW Van tire.

I've read good things about the Michelin.  I can save $40.00 a tire with the
Kirkland.  I'm not much into names and brands.  I'm thinking while the
Michelin may be marginally better, I'll probably be perfectly happy with the
Kirkland.  I will, after all be comparing the Kirkland with the crappy tires
I have now, not the Michelin's on the sheft at the tire store.

Anyone have any experience with these?  Recommendations?

Thanks.
