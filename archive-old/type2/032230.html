Maybe this is how this thread started, but didn't the popular female
singer named Jewel live in a bus before she was 'discovered'?  She
certainly lived in some sort of automobile, but I thought I had heard it
was a VW bus.  In any event she was located within a few blocks of my
current abode in Ocean Beach, a neighborhood of San Diego, CA.  Just
thought you might like to know.

In fact, I went and found this on the web:

After High School Jewel moved to San Diego, living with her mother whilst
doing a run of dead-end jobs including waitressing, but decided that this
was not her chosen goal and eventually jumped into her VW Camper van and
went on tour, writing songs en-route and eating lots of peanut-butter.

Eventually Jewel started performing regularly at the Inner Change
coffee-bar in Pacific Beach. Word soon spread of this talented young
singer/songwriter and soon she was playing to massive crowds, people being
turned away as the place filled out. She began to get mentions in the
local press and soon the record company fat-cats were driving down to the
little coffee-bar and off to her little camper-home to try to woo her.
