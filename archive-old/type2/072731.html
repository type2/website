Subject: Rod casting marks missing?
Message-Id: &lt;v01540b01b341c05e7b00_at_[207.224.205.73]&gt;

I've finally assembled all the parts I need to build my spare engine for
&quot;The Green Bean&quot;.. I started to assemble the crank tonight and after
installing the cam gears, I pulled the rods from my parts washer and took a
look at &quot;Bentley&quot; for instructions.  Page 66 shows the rods having casting
marks for reference in assembly.  My rods are minus this feature.  Every VW
engine I've ever built has had these marks (1200,1600,t3, rabbit deisel,
t2)  Why are these missing.  The rods  and crank come from a '78 donor
engine.  Luckily, I chiseled numbers across the saddle connections when I
disassembled the previous engine so I know what direction they came out.
Or do I?  They were marked with all the rods pointed in one direction.  So
don't I have a 50% chance of getting them in right.  Or does it matter.  I
can see no symetrical difference with these rods.  I'm almost sure these
are original factory issue.  I don't think the PO had any engine work done.

Any one out there have any inspiration?

Have fun
