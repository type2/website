Subject: distributor id

Got a milk crate full of dizzies at a swap meet.  All
vacuum dizzies removed from engines going for a 009. 
Problem is my cunning plan of IDing them online has
been foiled by the lack of info on Australian dizzies
online.  Im looking for a specs sheet too so I can
mix'n match to get the best specs for my little 'ol t1
engined bay.  The numbers I have a big selection of
(excluding a half dozen old cast iron types ~late
50s/early 60s) are

231 061 401

231 137 009

231 137 013

A suffix letter list for the VW disributor part
numbers would be really cool too.

Any pointers to where I can find this info myself
(searched archives)

cheers 

todd
