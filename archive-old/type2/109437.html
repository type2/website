Subject: Gas Heater

Hi all,

I have a 1977 2.0L Westy. It is a German spec. Left Hand Drive model. (I am
in the UK).

It has a Gas Heater installed in the cupboard designed to hold the spare
wheel, it runs on Butane/Camping Gaz, it is a silver square-ish box with two
vents/holes, one is probably inlet, one outlet. There is a
Control/Thermostat mounted behind the drivers seat on the side window frame,
with round temperature knob and two switches, one of the switches brings on
a blower fan, the gas is not connected at the moment.

Does anyone know of this type of heater and how they work?

Andy Vines
