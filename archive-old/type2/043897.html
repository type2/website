  I /might/ be able to

&gt;to them as i was purchasing them..and i've dealt with these guys for
&gt;years.)

Ponder that possability till monday.

&gt;
&gt;Just press in/out, yes? 

No, not as easy to do right as it is to say. You should heat the heads to
heavy leather gloves hot to insure good results, both for removal and
installation. An annealing oven is standard gear in any machine shop that
does European heads right.  

Do the guides need to be reamed, or anything?

Yes, the easiest and only way to fit new valves with new guides. You must
first remove the old guides, then clean the bores, then measure them.
Expect non spec. Then either turn new guides to fit or bore to a standard
oversize. Then install them and ream them for spec valves.

&gt;What size reamer? 

Check the Bentley for the spec. If you don't have one, better get one
before going further.

 no chance i can pull the guides out of Steves heads and
&gt;reuse them in the SIR heads, is there?

Maybe a 5% chance. About the same chance of getting something both cheap
and right all at the same time. You are into this with two sets of non-spec
heads not serviceable as is. It will cost the same to put things right now
as it would have before you wasted money on unusable parts. Would have been
enough to get a set of heads done by Beck or someone like him, ie, meeting
all specs.

Know that knurling and reaming of existing guides can work well. Use a
thread forming tap to force threads into the old guide from each end. This
work hardens the metal. Ream them to spec. The valleys of the remaining
thread will provide excellent oil reservoir with perhaps a little less heat
transfer surface, not of much concern if all else is right with the engine.

Know also after this is done, the valve seats must be recut, if they have
enough material left for specs. If not, replacing those will take someone
with real skills and experience.

Don't know where your at, but Northwest Con Rod in Seattle has earned a
good rep for VW engine work.
