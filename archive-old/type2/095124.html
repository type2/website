Subject: Front disc problems


Hi

I have worked with my brakes for almost 2 weeks now and they still don´t 
work.

I have a bus from 73 with a 1600cc engine and a dual circuit brake system 
with discbrakes on the front wheels and a servo.
The rear brakes workes fine but the disc up front is broken.

I started with dismantling the wheelcylinders and get them running smooth 
and nice, then I replaced the brake lines for the front wheels, then I 
bought a used master cylinder and dismantled the cylinder and replaced all 
the seals.
But the front brakes still doesn´t work, I can´t get enough pressure, when I 
press down the pedal hard it brakes but not so much. I can still turn the 
wheel by hand.

So now I am out of ideas!!
I have connected the front brakes on the front cylinder in the master 
cylinder and then the brakes(discs) work perfect.
So the problem is in the master cylinder.
I think that the rear cylinder doesn´t get brake fluid becose when I open 
the brakelight switch I don´t get a lot of brakefluid on my face as I do 
when I open the front cylinder switch.
Maybe the cylinder doesn´t return as it should??

It comes fluid throw the bleeder bolt if I open the bleeder bolt and put 
pressure on the reservoir tank.
So that should mean that the compensating port in the master cylinder is 
free. Im I right???

So what is the fault? I am sick of working with my brakes so PLEASE HELP 
ME!!!

Give me all the questions you need to find out where the problem is.

Sorry for my pooooooor englich

//Johan
