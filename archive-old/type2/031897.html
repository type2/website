Hi Volks,

My '78 Westy's odometer just clicked over to 000,000.0 I'm guessing that 
means 200,000. I suppose 300,000 is possible, but pretty unlikely.

I saw it coming on a drive from San Francisco home to Santa Barbara CA. I 
tried to pay attention and see it actually click over, but next thing I 
knew... &quot;Doh!&quot; It's at 000,035... I'll get another chance in another 100K 
I guess.

Anyone got a lot more miles than that on theirs?

Drive safely,
Surfer Bob
