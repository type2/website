Subject: Re: [T2] re: in-line blowers

to add to the in-line blower thread.    here is what I have done on my 78

when I got it there was a non functioning A/C and a fully rusted out heat
system....so
.  I removed most of the A/C system
.  I put a BA-4 (from a 412) under the front of the bus on the evaporator
brackets
.  I reconfigured the A/C blower system to draw air from under the dash
and duct it to the under bus heater. 
.  the output from the heater was ducted back into the stock heater duct
just behind the front beam.
.  the entire stock heat system from the front beam back has been totally
removed.

I get good heat and plenty of airflow....
