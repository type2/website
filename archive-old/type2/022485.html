&gt;How hard is it to remove ALL the windows on a 1973 bus??

&gt;I want to replace it all window seals with new rubber, and new chrome. Is the hardest of all to remove the windshield?? 


The easiest way is to use a really sharp knife and cut the seals, best are the 
knives with the long blade that slides out of the handle, use a new blade, 
and maybe some silicone spray or similar lubricant on the blade. On the 
outside of the car, slide the blade between the glass and the seal, be careful 
not to cut too deep and scratch the paint underneath, you don't have to cut all 
the way through the rubber, as long as you've made a fairly deep cut all around 
the circumference of the window, then just grab the seal and free it, away from 
the car, and go all round, hold the glass while you do this, then with a light 
tap from the inside, it will pop off of the the inner portion of the seal, the glass 
tends to stick to it, with the glass out of the way, just pull off the remaining 
part of the seal, be careful along the edges where there is headliner 
material. In the time it took me to write this one could've removed all 
but the door windows from of a Bug. 

The bad part of doing it this way is that you have to be careful with the 
windows now that they're out of the car, if you removed them with the 
seals intact they are a little more protected during storage. Best is 
not to stack the windows on top of eachother, dirt will easily scratch them.

Hope it helps, 

Brian
