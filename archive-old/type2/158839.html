&gt;    Quite a few years ago, an older (80+) friend of mine gave me a '69
&gt; Ghia...Pretty beat, lots of rust, etc... Neighbor down the street from
&gt; me saw in in my backyard and went nuts over it...I told him it was his,
&gt; but no returns... ;-(
&gt;    We hooked a chain to it and lugged it to his backyard.
&gt;    The next day his wife saw me and said that although she was not all
&gt; that happy to see it in &quot;her&quot; backyard she was happy that her husband
&gt; had finally found his dream car...He'd wanted one ever since he saw
&gt; Eddie Murphy drive one in &quot;48 Hours&quot;
&gt;    I didn't say a word... ;-)

Heh, if I remember Eddie drove a banged up Nova in 48 hrs but if the guy 
told his wife that and she didn't know any better at least it kept it 
from coming back on you.
