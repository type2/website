I  used Alan Scofield panels when I repaired the windscreen last year &amp;
found them excellent, has anyone in the USA used them? They don't have a web
site, but I could scan their brochure (1 page) &amp; ftp it to my site. All
anyone would need to do is remove the &quot;/lazybays&quot; from my address &amp; down
load.

I have no affiliation with them but when I have ordered _at_ 3pm the panels are
with me the next day! (OK that's UK, but they do special panels that are
unavailable)

Yes/NO?
