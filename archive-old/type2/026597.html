X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL


OK folks, it's finally fixed, and here's what the problem was:

When I last posted to this list, I was going to spend Saturday taking the
valve cover off on the side of the engine that wasn't working.  When I did
that, I was rather perplexed to see that the rocker arm assembly looked
fine, as did everything else.  I did a quick valve clearance check, and they
were OK, also.  At this point, I decided to go ahead and install the new
intake manifold gaskets I bought on Friday, since I didn't know what else to
do.  I chose to put in one of those thick paper gaskets, instead of the thin
metal ones that are also available.

Well, it turned out that this little piece of paper fixed the problem!!!  As
I reported last week, I tried the WD-40 spraying trick, which didn't work.
I guess this means that the vacuum leak was really bad.  I think what caused
this problem, is that I put in a new carb and center-section, and as I
stated before, I only loosened the right-side intake manifold.  Apparently,
I must have knocked loose the &quot;grime seal&quot; on the left-side intake manifold,
which created the vacuum leak.  Anyway, the engine now runs great.  It's
amazing to me that the engine ran pretty well on just 2 cylinders, but I
won't want to experience that again.

Thanks for everyone's input!!

Jim Hood
