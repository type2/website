&gt; I want to compare stock spring rates for my '79 bus

&gt; Also have had a longtime interest in the possibility

&gt; Kinda neat to pull into the camping spot and lower the
&gt; suspension to the stops. Discussion welcome. -BaH

good news/bad news situation, the bus would be fairly easy to convert to
air suspension and there are a number of places that have them avaliable
(try the camper conversion places, also the handicapped van modifiers
which use air)

the bad news is those things are expensive, figure about $2grand to
convert a bus and that is with you doing the work.

could maybe help you with sources if you get real serious but it would not
be a bolt in job, you would need real serious mechanical and welding
skills
