&gt; Does anyone have a list of what VW busses were called during each
&gt; year and why my insurance co. says that according to my vin
&gt; number my camper is not a camper at all it is a Kombi?

VW made Kombis.  Other firms made campers (Westfalia, Devon,
etc.). Generally the Kombi version made by VW was the base on
which the camper people made their campers.  This has been true
from the split era, through the bay era and the Vanagon era and
up to the EuroVan Winnebago.

The progression (loosely) of VW bus models is:

Deluxe Microbus
Microbus
Kombi
Panel
Truck

with each having progressively fewer interior fancies.

Campers may have been made from panels by someone but, as the
name implies, they had panels-not windows-so visibility was
severely reduced.

Tell your insurance company that your bus left the VW factory as
a Kombi, went straight to the Westfalia factory, and left there
as a camper.

Searching for some point of comparison, Avantis started out as
Studebakers and later Ch*vy C*rv*ttes, but by the time The Avanti
people got done, it was no longer Stude or Ch*vy.
