Subject: Bus Depot prices to HIGH ! I Found parts way cheaperhere

Right on Mark!! 

And we customers (read: informed listmembers) expect the same ethic from our local less-than-quality shops who try to take it the other way. 

(IE substituting crap for parts I bought and requested to be installed because I know they're right)

...it just seems that people don't want the owners of businesses to make anything at all for their troubles. Well thats fine and dandy but here is what I do. 1st no warrantees, 2nd labor rate just went up from 50 per hour to 75 per hour, 3rd if I take it apart and the part is wrong or doesn't work and I have to put it back it is the same price as doing the job, 4th if it is wrong and it is down on the lift it is $50.00 per hour sitting onthe lift till the right part shows up.  So go buy your junk(Pertronix, J C Whipme, Taiwianize crap ) and bring it on...
