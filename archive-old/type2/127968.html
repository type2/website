Subject: Re: [T2] Used Rotor question

What should I do with the old rotors? Recycling, reconditioning?? They
are pretty well worn. Any ideas from anyone who has done similar work in
the past?
&lt;&lt;

Chris,

take them to a brake shop. they can tell you if they are within spec
&amp; can be reconditioned. (take Bentley with you just in case they
don't have the measurements for a 72 bus)

if they can't be reconditioned, most places could probably recycle them
for you. might have to pay a small disposal fee.

good luck,
