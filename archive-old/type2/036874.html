&gt; Ted and the List,
&gt; 
&gt; What kind of cam are you running?  If stock, go with the 1.4 ratio rockers.
&gt; Gotta friend running those with dual Weber 34s and extractor exhaust.  It's
&gt; about the same as my 1600 with dual Kadron's, Engle 110 cam (w/1.1 rockers)
&gt; and extractor exhaust.
&gt; 
&gt; If you're trying to run with a stock exhaust, you are wasting your money on
&gt; other modifications (IMHO).  The stock exhaust system doesn't allow the
&gt; engine to breath deep enough to benefit from more carburation.  My stock
&gt; dispacement 1600 runs quite nicely with the 110 cam, smoothed exhaust and
&gt; intake ports, dual Kadrons and extractor exhaust.  And, it gets low twenties
&gt; on the highway cruising 60-65.  It will run faster (I've had it momemtarily
&gt; up to 80 but backed off - too scary for a '69 Kombi!)

&gt; &lt;My rebuilt 1600 dp with CW crank, balanced fully,smoothed intake and exhaust

&gt; am thinking about dual Kadrons and 1.25 ratio rocker arms. Anyone have an
&gt; opinion (boy, that's a loaded statement)on the effect these mods would have?
&gt; Would they affect reliability?Any help or information would be greatly
&gt; appreciated. TBear&gt;

Check this out.
Try the stock exhaust with dual kadrons, your choice of cam and instead of
using those stupid straight pipes on the Type II exhaust, use this:
       
        | |      | |
        | |      | |
________| |______| |_
\                    )
 \__________________/

I forget what this is called, but it sounds cool, and breathes real well
with the stock typeII setup.
