Subject: Re: [T2] Dash Speaker question

Yeah - no problem as we have a family nut and bolt business. We also have 
two very good Mom and Pop hardware stores locally with odd-ball nuts and 
bolts. Lowe's even has a decent selection too.

Any idea what size this speaker needs to be?

&gt;At the hardware store, the screws were where they keep their speciality 
&gt;items in sets of drawers.  They weren't a bubble pack item.  At the store 
&gt;I went to they referred to them as Hillman items.  In the drawer with the 
&gt;screws there were small allen wrenches that sold for about 45 cents.


Ciao!
