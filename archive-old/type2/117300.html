&gt; &gt; Here's the problem: 2 L hyrdaulic lifters on an engine pushing an
&gt; automatic
&gt; &gt; transmission look different than lifters on an engine pushing a standard
&gt; &gt; transmission, at least in the manual they look different.
&gt; 
&gt; There's no difference in the cam followers between an engine attached to an
&gt; automatic vs. an engine attached to a standard trans.

HOWEVER, when you remove the flex plate and put on the flywheel you will
have to reset your endplay.....
