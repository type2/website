Subject: vw stuff for sale

For those of you who caught my email a couple weeks ago about the stuff for 
sale and the abiltity of us to drop off on route to Missouri, we are no longer 
going, sorry to those that were interested. We might do a trip in the spring 
but nothing set in stone, so anyone interested in a 78 tranny, a 2.0l block 
with heads, or 1700 block. all good stuff, email for more info and make offer, 
needs to be picked up from Buffalo to Ithaca somewhere, can travel small part.
