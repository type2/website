Subject: Re: 73 Pict-34 LH Carb part req'd

Hi Volks,

I only just realized I futzed the link to the right carb... It should have
read:

http://www.geocities_dot_com/vw_type2/Carbs/RCarb.jpg

...But that doesn't matter much now. David Kelly has told me he'll be
sending me the part I need, and I took the following images to hopefully
help him sort out the plumbing on his. If anyone is able to look at these
and see if *I'm* doing something wrong I'd be glad to hear about it.

Here's the new pics, I shot each carb from Top with and without the air
cleaner in place, from the front, and from the side. (3/4 view)

&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; Have a look at my left hand Solex Pict-34 Carb:
&gt; http://www.geocities_dot_com/vw_type2/Carbs/LCarb.jpg
&gt; 
&gt; And compare to the right side at:
&gt; http://www.geocities_dot_com/vw_type2/Carbs/LCarb.jpg
&gt; 
&gt; I've highlighted the arm from the choke (?) to the main linkage, it seems to
&gt; have broken off right where the retainer clip goes to keep it attached. What
&gt; is the function of this linkage??? The carbs seem to work OK without it, but
&gt; more accurately stated I'd simply have to say they don't appear to work all
&gt; that much worse. But that's not saying much. Lately I only get about 16 MPG.
&gt; 
&gt; Both of these carbs already need major work on the throttle bodies, plus the
&gt; accelerator pump is out of action on the left side.
&gt; 
&gt; If someone has a working linkage arm they want to sell from a parts carb,
&gt; please let me know ASAP.
&gt; 
&gt; Happy trails,
