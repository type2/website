Subject: '73 Bus has gotta go

Hi again,

I've tried to find a new home for the &quot;old&quot; '73 Westy Weekender, but to
no avail. So I've committed to parting it out... some stuff is already
spoken for. The bus has rocker panel and wheel well rust, but is
otherwise straight. Z-Bed is there, wardrobe was cut down by PO, other
cabinets gone. 

The Bus is in Salt Lake City, Utah (USA). I need a few bucks for some of
the bigger chunks, but I'm not trying to retire off of it. I would be
happy to pull some of the other bits for listees for the price of
shipping, or I could sit on parts until you're passing through... p-mail
me with what you need.

BTW: this one is being retired because I've got a more complete Westy
Weekender to take it's place.

I also have a set of bench seats (middle and rear) for an early loaf.
Arm rest handle is split but repairable, original upholstery in good
shape.

Thanks for the bandwidth,

Paul
