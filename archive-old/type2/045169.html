Subject: [T2] rebuilt engine won't start

hey list,

you may remember me as the guy whose fan fell of his crankshaft of his
rebilt AVP block (2L type4, hyd. lifters, FI). since then i've had the
crankshaft replaced at a local shop to the tune of $670. I've got the engine
in the bus and it won't start now.

I've set the timing (with light while cranking), i've checked my hoses, i've
got fuel, i've got spark. the engine is firing when i crank it, but won't
catch and run. i've got white smoke from the tailpipe while cranking. i've
checked connections to the AFM, ECU, FI grounds to case, etc. i've already
run the battery down twice trying to start it and check various things, and
i'm stumped.

does white smoke mean excess fuel?? should i advance the timing a little??

stumped,
