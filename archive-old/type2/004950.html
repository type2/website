Subject: Oil light coming on on 2 liter
Date: Sun, 17 Sep 2000 07:46:46 -0400
Organization: Microsoft Corporation

Here is my question.

New 2lliter rebuild.....runs great.  After a good interstate run, I come to
a stop sign, oil light pops on, pressure gauge reads 10 PSI.  Slightly touch
accelerator, light goes out.

I thought about raising the idle, but it is fine.  My concern is that I do
not want to get into the habit of ignoring this light,  or train my wife to
ignore it, because sooner or later it will be a problem that is causing the
light to come on.

Could there be a problem with the sending unit, or could the sending unit be
swapped to come on at a lower PSI?
