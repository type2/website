Volks:
Let me begin by saying that I did something very dumb, I was replacing some
lightbulbs on the instrument cluster of my 71 Westy,... with the bus running
and the switch on. Of course, one of the bulb holder wires slip off my hand,
contactred the back of the instrument cluster (metal) and there was a lot of
smoke and sparks (behind the instrument cluster). Now my generator light is
on and every time I activated the turn signal the Fuel gage's needle drops
to the &quot;Empty&quot; position. Did I fried my generator? Thanks in advance

Vic
