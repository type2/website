Hi John,

The compression on my 2L 80 Westy is 95,112,110,120. 
It's a rebuild with the last of the Mark Stephens
heads, and only has 2.6 K miles on it.  The max mpg I
get on flat terrain is 19 mpg (I'm guessing due to
somewhat low compression).  The rebuilder has agreed
to have another go at it mainly to try to increase hot
idle oil pressure (7psi presently).  How do I get more
compression?  His thinking is simply to try seating in
the valves better. It sounds to me like he should be
planning on deck adjustments, but I'm not really sure
how involved that would be.

He's a rebuilder with 24 years experience that cranks
out dozens of rebuilds a year.  However, other than
making sure the idiot light goes off on fresh
rebuilds, he doesn't measure oil pressure (didn't even
have a gage last year).  With all that though, he does
seem to be genuinely interested in improving his
techniques, and says he's going to be there for the
long haul.

This next rebuild will use Bob's famed crank grinder
in Baltimore, and hopefully some tricks to get
compression up around 135 to 150.  I'm hoping this
effort on both sides will lead to a superior rebuilder
in the Northern Virginia area.  I'm sure the mechanic
isn't going to make much on my 2L, but if he gets it
right I'll be glad to let everyone know who he is. 
We'll see what happens with this next rebuild.

Rob Dalton
