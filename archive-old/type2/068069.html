Subject: Zodi hot showers

Since the URL I posted last week for Zodi hot showers didn't work out,
I promised many of you I'd post tidbits from the brochure I got
from them via snail-mail.  

They are basically convection, pump-free units.  They look sort of
like one of those electric units one uses to light charcoal in
a BBQ, except that it's a copper coil, which one sets either over
open flame, or atop for instance a propane burner.  Basically, they work
on thermal siphoning, so no need for batteries, etc.  Just place
the heating coil in your campfire, or over your stove, and the
hot water is supposed to begin to flow.  They offer many
different models, and most range 10-20 minutes to heat.  Some have
a &quot;sack&quot;-like holding tank, others what looks more like a real
metal tank.  The latter can even be fitted with it's own special
burner attachment to hold a propane bottle.  

I called this place nearly a year ago, and it took them this long to
send me a catalog.  :)  They never returned any of the 3 phone calls,
either, so they may be a bit flakey, but their products looks as if
they'd have a very pertinant application to VW campers, judging
by the pictures.

 Current lust list: DC/12v coffee-grinder &amp; blender, a Eurovan TDI transporter,
  black currant juice, a moped, hot showers and a faucet top for my '81 westy,
   and last but not least:  a pair of those old-fashioned metal roller-skates,
    made, I think, by Winchester (but any would do) - the kind which fasten
     onto the outside of your shoes and are length- and width-adjustable
      with a metal key.  They have leather straps for the ankle.  They were
       very popular in the 60's.
