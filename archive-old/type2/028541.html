&gt;Gee, have you heard about the new innovation called &quot;Windows&quot;? No, not the
one from Micro$oft, but the ones in your bus? As you drive, the images in
the windows changes in a number of interesting and often exciting ways! Many
people, including children, have found that viewing these changing scenes is
an interesting way to pass the time during a trip.

&gt;If you drive into the mountains you will see images of trees and sometimes
snow, while going downhill will give you desert vistas and beach scenes!

&gt;Video screens in a VW bus? Sheesh!

Without expressing an opinion on whether kids need or don't need TV in
vehicles.... I have gone cross country no less than 15 times in the last 2
1/2 years - with my four kids, now ages six through twelve. On no occasion
have we utilized TV, etc. High tech entertainment was the stereo. They have
seen things most of their friends cannot even dream about! My daughter
drives her schoolmates crazy in geography class....

As for the Bus part, we are getting ready to do our first cross-country in
the Bus next month. We are going Spokane, WA to Upstate NY. Even the radio
is dead in the Bus. We'll have to talk (yipes) or something to amuse
ourselves!
