&gt; Hey Jamie   How come they all say Hey Bubba watch this when they do that LOL

well I have to drive to Dallas via I-40 next week and had hoped to take my
bus but the cost of gas is sort of forcing me to take my wifes car cuz it
gets 34mpg on the road.  so if you see this scruffy guy in a Blue Saturn
waving at you squint and hold your teeth tight, shoulders up, kinda cringe
and it will really look like my blue 78 bus I would rather be driving.
