Subject: Suddenly new steering!!
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I noticed a squeal from my tyres recently
So, I checked the air pressure (or the first time in months)
The air pressure was down to about 10 lb. in front
When I added air, the steering was beautifully light &amp; no squeals.
As a salutary warning the tyre separations for SUV's is due to driving with 
ow tyre pressure in the Saudi Arabian desert and driving home at 80 mph with 
5 psi tyres!

So please, let's all check our tyre pressures.
