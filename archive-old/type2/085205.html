Subject: Polishing Problem

Hiya All,

Just a bit ago I recall reading a post to the list which described the 
beltline trim as being &quot;bright dip&quot; rather than polished aluminum.  And, I 
believe, there was a further reference to the differences in polishing this 
stuff as opposed to aluminum.  Well, I have my beltline trim off the Duck 
while it's being painted.  And, of course, I am interested in making this 
stuff look good to go with the new paint job.  So...........just how does one 
go about &quot;renewing&quot; bright dip metal trim?  Any information (but especially 
info about products or refinishers to use) would be appreciated.

ps.  This trim sure looks like aluminum to me.
