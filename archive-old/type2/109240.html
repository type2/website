Subject: Greetings,(New listee) W/ no spark brain teaser!!!

rob,
Sounds like you've done a lot of fault finding already.
My guess is it's something simple you've either forgotten or something gone
astray.
If you 'hot wire' the coil direct from the battery and can crank it, the
motor will run regardless of what's wrong with the ignition. (sounds like
you've already tried that one).
Next, you say you have no spark? I assume you have a spark plug out to see?
Look for the simple things, incorrect points gap, timing, damage (cracks or
carbon build up) to the rotor or cap. I'd also replace the condenser if you
have a spare.
Let us know how you go!
Richard,
Brisbane Australia
