&gt; On May 7th --I had a hip replacement--and one of the things i had to buy
was an elevated
&gt; seat above for the house toilet , that is adjustable in height, -because i
was not allowed
&gt; to bend over too far---The 1st time Magoo and i saw it--we knew it would
become a part of
&gt; our VW Bus Camping equipment--!! You do not even have to by new!! You can
go to a store
&gt; that has used equipment for various people who need assistance at home--
&gt; crutches--canes--etc.  The raised potti seat comes with a &quot;Container&quot; that
you just put
&gt; under the raised seat and inset a plastic bag----and Viola!! You have a
porta potti!!!
&gt; The entire assembly also breaks down!! Medicare paid for ours!!  TWWM, uj
