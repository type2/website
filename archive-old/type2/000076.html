As I go through the messages I print out the ones that I think might be 
useful sometime.  This weekend when I pulled the engine and found cracked CV 
boots, no thermostat, no exhaust tin on the oil cooler and replaced the 
generator with an alternator I grabbed a handful of pertinent messages and 
carried them into the garage.  Much easier than looking for things in 
manuals, even though I do own them, and much easier to carry around than a 
bulky manual.  Thanks to all of you who made my job easier and my engine run 
better.
