Subject: Re: [T2] Installing RMMW Mudflaps on a 78.

I changed the title before the flames begin...

&gt; Hopefully someone can help with other ideas or brackets,

I can barely read the instructions but it appears the mounting bracket for
late bay bumper is shorter than the split design (the late bay bracket
mounts into the engine carrier clip instead).

Jamie drew up plans for the stock brackets:

I'm not suggesting throw out what you have and fabricate these but I want to
point out that if you do, you should drill the holes that mount the flaps
themselves LAST because the have the holes may not be 100mm apart as the
plans indicate. The made in Venezuela mudflaps with the logo that I have
aren't exactly even the same size. One set of holes is 94mm apart, the other
96mm.
