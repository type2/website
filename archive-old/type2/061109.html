Subject: Fuel sender replacement

Hi, 
 new to the list so I'll say hello.
Names Andrew, from London &amp; I have a '76 lhd high-top
1600 camper. I need to replace the fuel sender &amp; I would rather not
take the tank out etc... The inside of the rear floor is covered with
ply wood, so any hole would be covered. Does any-one have accurate
measurements for the hatch. I presume it is to be cut in the rear
cargo area, just before the 45 degree slope to the wheel arches. The
van is just going into a friends shop to have loads of welding done,
so an ideal time to do it.
Any info is appreciated, i have checked the archives, but there are
only vague references &amp; purism arguments. 

please mail me at mrwhipy_at_yahoo_dot_com
Andrew
