Subject: Dumb Type I to Type IV Question - existing engine tin etc
Date: Thu, 24 May 2001 19:04:28 +1000
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Sorry, tried the archives &amp; library, but couldn't find the answer there.

I've been looking for a decent Bay Window Crew Cab, and may have found
pretty much what I'm looking for, including the more stylish pre-'73 nose
treatment ( if I suspend sensibility long enough to spend the money on the
Crew Cab, rather than the house rebuilding ). The only significant problem
that I can see, is that (from the pictures), it appears to have a Type I
engine. I was after the crew cab to have a little bit more performance, so
I'd be looking to use a built up Type IV motor &amp; Type 2 gearbox in it.

While I've seen the tips about creating engine tin, and kits, to fit a Type
IV into a Type I engine bay, there is no mention of retro-fitting existing
Type IV tin ( probably because it's not possible, I realise ).

Would it be possible to swap in the engine (with tin), trans, brakes etc out
of a mid 70's ('75-'76) Kombi straight into a '68-'71 Crew Cab? The local
shop is scrapping a fairly complete Kombi, which I could probably pick up at
a reasonable price. Would it be a viable option to buy the scrapped Kombi,
and swap the later parts and tin into the earlier Crew Cab?

Sorry for yet another dumb question, thanking you in anticipation.

Regards,

Neale Green
