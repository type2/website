Subject: Re: [T2] `77 Gas cap

From: &quot;Richard Atwell&quot; &lt;ratwell_at_mac_dot_com&gt;
&gt; Bus Depot sells a really nice German locking cap for $16. My original
locking cap from the dealer is in on the left in the picture for comparison.

Was the original cap a locking one?  I was assuming that it was one of the
ones with the &quot;VW&quot; logo on it.
