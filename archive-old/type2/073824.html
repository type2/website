Subject: #3 cylinder not firing, or not? #3 plug grey and dry

I believe someone saying that #3 cylinder was rigged
in such a way that at idle removal of HT leads to
plugs would not necessarily produce a drop in RPM thus
indicating that it was not firing. If I've  got that
correct, then my sluggish, missing, slightly poop,
poop,back firing performance may be due to something
else. What else likely? How perform that check, Higher
RPM? Also #3 plug grey and Dry.
