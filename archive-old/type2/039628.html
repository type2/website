Subject: Gas tank cleaning alternatives

Hi, Volks.

Below you will find helpful hints, opinions, and detailed instructions on
how my son should deal with his egg-in-the-tank dilemma.

FYI, we have decided on the following FIRST (low-co$t) approach:

Two large, in-line filters in parallel before the small in-line filter
currently in the line. I plan to add a fuel cut-off before one of the
filters, so that it will serve as a standby. redundant filter.  If the one
big filter clogs, my son will open the shutoff and run on the other, until
it is convenient to change the first.

My son will be able to change the filters, as needed, until the problem
takes care of itself.

For the record, sounds like the *right* thing to do is remove the tank
and clean it.

Thanks to all who responded.

For those of you who were on-list two years ago, my son and his then
significant other had travelled 11,000 miles around the US in his camper.  
I provided updates and highlights of their trip and occasionally asked
advise about problems encountered.  On the return trip they found that
'they' were pregnant. I announce the birth of their son on the list Feb
28th, 1998.

Don...

I would first crawl under and disconnect the fuel line fromt he bottom
of the tank..be prepared for the fuel flow that will follow.;)

now, the nipple that the line was attached to had a large nut above it,
that attachs it to the tank.  remove the nut, and remove the whole nipple,
and filter assembly.

Now, insert garden hose into tank and flush flush flush.  steam might help
as well.   with luck, the eggs are, or will, broke so the bits will just
wash out....


good luck.

Don,

You could get underneath above the transmission and remove the 
filter(pre-filter) if you have another inline one.  The pick-up and filter is 
all one piece.  The problem may lie on how large the debris in your tank 
is(i.e.-egg shells).  The opening is only about 1/2&quot;  in diameter.  You 
should be able to remove/replace the engine and tank in one afternoon or a 
one six-pack per person with two people(however you gauge time with 
projects).  While you are there you might want to consider treating and 
sealing the tank if necessary with either a &quot;POR&quot; or Eastwood product.  Also 
check your filler neck rubber hose and fuel lines at that time.  Personally I 
would prefer the R/R option even though is is more time consuming.  There is 
just something about being stuck on one of america's deserted highways with 
egg on my face and in my tank.  Of course this is only my opinion... I could 
be wrong.

Hi Don!

Gasoline is a very good preservative if the tissue is submerged. Many
listees will attest to the organic matter that has survived in various gas
tanks to wreak havoc, leaves and sticks and so forth. Once Joe Fournier
came up with a dessicated mouse from a tank, I saw it, it was not in good
condition but it was mostly intact. If it were me I would pull engine,
pull the tank , hose it out with detergent and lots of water, chase it
with isopropyl alcohol, re-install. Some people slosh with marbles or big
gravel. I believe this will save time in the long run although it will
deprive the mechanic of some income. =^ )

I don't know what eggs do in gasoline, but I would think that it would be
pretty well broken up by now.  Why don't you try draining the tank,
pulling the screen, and running water in quantity through it?  You'll
probably flush out the remaining debris.  If some big chunks remain you
could get under the bus and run a test tube brush in and out of the outlet
while the water is flowing to try and break up the remaining stuff.

After this, you will have to get the residual water out of the tank.  You
could run an air hose into the tank and let it go for an hour or so.

the only way I would do this without removing the engine would be with a
dual wand system, one blowing in steam and water/cleaner AND some sort of
suction device to suck out what is loose in the tank, I would use the
largest diameter hose I could get into the tank.  

for presure try the high presure drain opener for kitchen sinks, about $15
at home depot.

for suck you could use a POWERFULL wet dry vac (NOT WITH GAS, non flamable
materiel only it could explode)

take hoses off bottom of tank, insert both hoses, turn on the water full
blast and after a few minutes start sucking the debris.  I would keep it
up for at least 1/2 hour....personally I would probably still pull the
engine myself, the 71 is one of the easiest engines to pull...so bite the
bullet

I think the mechanic is speaking truthfully. Were it me and my bus, I'd
remove the tank and clean it. On a '71, the engine pull is about a 45
minute job if you've only done it once or twice; it's about a 3 hour job if
you've never done it and you're scared. It requires bracing/chaining the
tranny and removal of the rear engine hangar along with the 4 standard
engine/tranny bolts. The bolt above the starter is tricky to get back in,
but not any worse than in earlier buses; perhaps even a little better, as a
friend with a long socket and a flashlight can actually see and support the
bolt. My problem was that I always worked alone.

Your son would need a floor jack and a place to extricate and not much more
than standard tools. If he's never done it before, he'd want to label
everything, especially wires. Go slowly. If something binds or catches,
find out what it is. Don't forget to disconnect the heater box cables or
the accelerator cable.

Once the engine is out, the firewall has to be removed, but that only
entails small screws that he can see; the thing is puttied to the bus, so
you have to pry slowly for it to come off.

Once he gets to the tank, the removal goes like this:

Remove hose to filler neck.
Remove hose under bus.
Tilt tank upwards from the back, pull back, and tilt and twist to get to
the sweet spot where it will come right out.

Cleaning the tank properly will take more time than pulling the engine. I'd
suggest finding a place locally that cleans tanks.

If your son is inclined to go for it and do it, I'd suggest hollering at
the list and see if someone dependable is close enough to be on call or to
go over and help. If I were doing it, I'd break the job up like this:

Wed-Thurs. Read up on engine pulls and gather tools, tanks to hold drained
gas, etc. Get floor jack, a couple short 4x4s or milk crates to set the
engine on, 10 ft. of the proper metric fuel line, etc. Find a place that
cleans tanks and make sure you know what they'll charge. Talk dad into
transferring money into bank account so I can buy a floor jack. (Ahhh,
those college memories are coming back!)

Friday evening right after work. Pull engine. Drain gas. Have a couple
beers afterwards (or ice tea if you're like me).

Saturday morning. Pull tank and take to place that cleans them. Have them
clean it and then immediately spray inside with denatured alcohol (to
remove water) and then WD 40 or some other rust inhibitor that will go
right into the fuel system in small quantities.

Saturday afternoon. Replace tank and engine and/or survey what other odd
jobs I'm going to tackle and be SURE to get all the parts before the FLAPS
closes!!! Now's a really good time to replace intake boots and fuel lines.
Sunday is NOT the day to buy parts. You'll end up at AutoZone and you'll
regret the inferior parts you'll be putting in your bus. Maybe not now, but
someday. And there are some parts, like metric fuel lines and intake boots
that you really ought to buy in advance, since even some FLAPs won't have
them or know what you're talking about.

Where is your son again, Don?

Good luck. I know this note is more than you asked for, but if you need any
more help, just holler. I know the '71 bus (in an almost-biblical sense. ;)
Joe
