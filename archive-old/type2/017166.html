Subject: starter bushing removal tool
References: &lt;MPHIFFPOPJAADAAA_at_theglobe_dot_com&gt;

I've had to remove a starter bushing with an engine installed, once. It
was a PITA, but I did it... with a 1/2&quot; diameter tap (well-used and ripe
for replacement anyways). 
	It took some time to develop a technique that worked, but it was
basically like this: remove the starter &amp; make sure no hot wires will
short out, etc.. Get under the bus &amp; tap the tap into the starter
bushing until it grabs, or won't turn or pull out by hand. Then, use an
appropriate wrench (or vise grips) and turn the tap clockwise while you
try to pull it out. If the tap has successfully embedded itself in the
bushing, it will turn and pull the bushing out with it. Since there is
no shortage of 1/2&quot; taps in the vicinity, I left the bushing stuck on
the tap as a trophy of sorts... and to remind me about it for the next
time I have to deal with that problem.

 Of course, the bushing is tough to remove without the engine out, but I
actually read about this in a VW Trends article describing how to use a
starter bushing removal tool. You can get the tool, the article says,
at:

&gt; or
