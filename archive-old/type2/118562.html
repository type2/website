Subject: split window $1500

Hey listees,
    I just spoke w/ Daryll at Silver Lake VW's in Wilmington, NC. He told me
he had a split window for 1500. Hes says it runs, but thats all I know. If
you want more info, pmail me and I'll get his number for you.
    He also has a couple of other buses in the 5000 range.
Later,
Jim
