&lt;&lt; have a 1972 bus that I fully replaced the rear brakes on about 8 years ago
(no master cylinder replacement). It then sat up some over this time period
(baby born, busy, etc, etc), with no appreciable miles

When I went to drive it recently, I found that when I come to a stop, that
the rear left (?) wheel locks and I have trouble stopping because the tire
just skids.

Check the rear brake pressure regulator.  Bentley says it is not repairable, 
however, I have found that it is sometimes possible to carefully take it 
apart, clean it thoroughly and get it to work properly.  The purpose is to 
keep the rear brakes from locking up when you really put the brakes on.  It 
maintains a proportional amount of pressure between front discs and back 
drums.
