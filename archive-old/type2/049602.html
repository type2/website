Subject: Re: [T2] Camping for low $$$$$$:

In California, AAA has &quot;camping maps&quot; with all the campgrounds marked on
the map, and a listing of all the amenities, price, etc, on the other
side.

There is also a camping book - or perhaps more than one.  The camp maps
are broken down into northern and southern.
