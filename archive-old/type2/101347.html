Subject: FW: Blizzard bus-out! (a camp/ski/snowboarding/etc campout in
  PA)

Blizzard bus-out!

     come one, come all for the fourth (sometimes annual) blizzard
bus-out in Pennsylvania's beautiful Pocono mountains. This year we
will gather on Friday, February 7 2003 at &quot;Otter Lake camp-resort&quot;.
Same place as last year with the same great price!  Just
$5.00/day/person with electric!!!

      on the very loose schedule of events, we have planned:
- a Friday night camp-fire social, complete with a steaming cauldron
of witches brew and some hot eats for weary travelers
-Saturday morning: those who can still function may join us at
near-by &quot;Shawnee Mountain2 http://www.shawneemt_dot_com for some fun on
the slopes, or at the bar inside their lodge!
- Saturday night, we get our grub on!  Bring your favorite pot-luck
specialty to share with the gang.  Ask your friends who joined us
last year; good times to be had!

      Did I mention the indoor pool and jacuzzi?  Oh yeah!  And best
of all, it looks like mother nature might provide us with a blanket
of snow this year for some juvenile fun!  Pack your sleds and
shovels, and what ever else might keep your fire burnin' on a long
winter's night!  Whaddayasayyyyy!!!!

      Please e-mail me (Drew) at mailto:allwein_at_lmf_dot_net so I know how
many campers to expect.  See you on the seventh!    -drew

P.S.  Bring fire wood!  Check out http://www.shawneemt_dot_com and
http://www.otterlake_dot_com Otter lake knows us as the &quot;vw camping group&quot;
