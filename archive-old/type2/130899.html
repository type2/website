Subject: how do I tell if I have hydraulic lifters?

Yes, I know there is a description in the library but I guess I'm just a guy 
who really has to see it to believe it.  Does anybody our there have 
pictures that show the difference between a hydraulic and a solid lifter?  I 
am replacing the pushrod tube seals anyway so I pulled one of them out using 
a little magnet on a stick thingy.  Do the hydraulic ones look different 
from solid lifters?  Can I just measure it or something?

Thanks,
Jaybird
