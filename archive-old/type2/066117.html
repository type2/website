&gt;I've never seen these anti-roll bars advertised for sale on this side 
&gt;of the pond, so was wondering if anyone could tell me about cost and where to 

&gt;get them (including fixing kits etc). Preferably somewhere that takes VISA or 

&gt;Mastercard and has a fax number, to make purchase easy.
&gt;
&gt;I'm not in a desparate hurry as my 5 year old rear brake shoes have just 
started
&gt;squeaking for attention.

&gt;Thanks in anticipation of your help.

Bob, 

I got mine by mail from Car Custom (Phone: 818-334-4951 Fax: 818-334-4729). 
Wish I could remember the price (it's not in their add). RMMW lists the retail 
price at $245 however, I didn't pay that much at Car Custom ($199??)
