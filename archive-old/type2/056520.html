Subject: Air Cooling Flaps - How to set up

I have a 76 bus with 2.0 liter engine and am re-assembling all the
engine externals. I was going to put everything back together the way it
came out, but the air cooling flaps (on either side of the fan housing -
top) did not look right. The right side is down and the left side is up.
Is this correct for a cold engine? Seems like both should be up. Any
help appreciated.

Thanks, Ron J.
