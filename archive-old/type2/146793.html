Subject: Re: [T2] Overheating / timing

Arnaud--sorry to lead you astray. . . sounds like the 205Q vacuum can is 
not the one we want.  more vac advance required for that scenario.   I 
guess for that particular dizzy you need retard to get the range you 
need.  If it were me I would just find that sweet spot without ping.  
actually I am about ready to buy a new ACN one with pertronix to make 
life easier. points never want to stay still for me.

make sure you're not giving it too much idle mix either that can bog you 
down, did that myself last weekend.

good luck and sorry again.
Will

&gt;I took your advice and tried to disconnect the vacuum retard, plug the
&gt;port on manifold and time dynamically at 5deg BTDC (and 8 BTDC on the
&gt;next ride). Warmed the beast and went for my test-hill-drive. I was
&gt;not impressed, neither by the power, nor by the &quot;flat spot&quot;.
&gt;
&gt;The dizzy is a stock for a 71 bus (205Q) . According to Oldvolkshome
&gt;it has minus 11-13 degrees of vacuum retard and plus 2-5 degrees of
&gt;vacuum advance. The total range of advance/retard is about 13 to 18
&gt;degrees.
