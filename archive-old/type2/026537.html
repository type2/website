&gt;my turn signal doesnt turn itself off automatically anymore (72 Westy) 
&gt;any idea why?

This is often as simple as sliding the turnblinker assembly back up the
steering column where it belongs and tightening it.  With time, this thing
slide down slightly and that prevents the little tab on the underside of the
steering wheel from turning it off.  

If your assemble can't be tightened enough to make it stay in place, the two
working solutions are to either split the assembly and carefully file some
plastic from the mating surfaces (preferred method) or to remove the
assembly and put a ring of vinyl or electrical tape around the steering
column where the assembly goes.
