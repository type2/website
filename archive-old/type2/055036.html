Subject: fold out bed

Greetings,

I don't want a full camper, but I want a bed in my 74 Bus. Thanks to a
fellow list member I now have a set of fold out brackets. I plan to build
the bed full width. I got a look at a camper with a full width bed (at a
wrecking yard) and see that I will have to modify one bracket to bolt to
the fender, but I'm blessed to have access to a full fab shop so I should
be able to solve that tomorrow. I'm also blessed to have a friend with
two campers that I can use for reference, one with the interior out, so I
can make all of the measurements and drawings I want.

OK, it looks like I have everything under control, but . . .

I know someone out there has done this before, so please share your
experience. P-mail me with any advise/stories that you have.

Thanks, 
Ray Carter
