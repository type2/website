Subject: Re: Yet another Newbie - with a 1971 Westy

&gt;I have a wrap around
&gt;front bumper with the rubber-covered built-in step under the doors.
&gt;And my turn signals are mounted high on the front panel at either end
&gt;of the front air intake grill.  Is the article wrong or do I have a
&gt;diferent kinda bus or what?

We need to know what's in the engine room. Your three replies suggest that
the front end has been spliced or is an off 71. But AFAIK there are no 72s
with upright engines. The engine *could* have been spliced, too, but flat
engine + high front lights argues that your title is wrong as a matter of
Ockham's Razor.

Is there a pedestal with an alternator on it? Is your pulley hanging right
out in the back with a belt up to the alternator?
