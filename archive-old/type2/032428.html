Howdy all!
A guy up the street from me is selling a couple of gas heater he says came out of VW's. I have never heard of the brand, so I want some advice before I buy one.  One is a &quot;HaDees&quot; gas heater, and the other one he says is a &quot;Volkswagen of America Instant heater&quot;.  Does anyone know anything about these or have any experience with them??  Thanks in advance for your help!
