&gt;Hi,

&gt;I have a '74 that needs the pulley for the smog pump. Obviously, I live
&gt;in California and have to have it smogged. My mechanic says that they
&gt;aren't available new. The pulley that I have is missing a bearing and is
&gt;welded so, you couldn't put another one in.
&gt;Any idea where to look for one?

I have had lots of ideas, and I've tried most of them and come up with
nothing.  A competent machine shop should be able to break the old welds,
remove the old bearing and weld in a new one.  But isn't your bus exempt at
the end of this year anyway?
