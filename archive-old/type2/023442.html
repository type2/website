Subject: FS complete Type IV inventory UPDATE!!
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-Sender-Ip: 12.75.179.252

After getting a good number of responses, I need to add:....
I prefer to sell the entire inventory as a complete lot.  If that does not
seem to materialize within the next couple of weeks or so, then I will
re-post with prices for each item.  So, don't hesitate to email me with what
individual items you are interested in, I will then contact folks on a first
come first served basis.  Hope that helps a bit.

zac
