I am 40, live in Berkeley, California and have

a 1962 Westfalia.

The bus is &quot;the bus&quot;, it doesn't have a name.

There are a lot of Type II's in Berkeley.  I counted three parked split
window busses on the way to work this morning.  I lost count of the parked
loafs after twelve and didn't try to count the Vanagans.  There are a lot of
good VW mechanics in and around Berkeley.    

I go to Small Car World in Albany for parts.  They have air cooled VW parts
in stock; including 6-volt batteries and lights.
