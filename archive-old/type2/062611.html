Subject: Re: More body work quaetions

&gt;is my question. If I did all the exterior body work and 
&gt;primed the whole vehicle, should this significantly reduce
&gt;the price of a paint job. Also, would it be worth the price
&gt;reduction considering my lack of experience and that I will
&gt;be using canned primer?

If you do it _right_/_well_.

&gt;My van has some hail damage on the roof. Probobly about
&gt;20 pings. Can I fill these with bondo and sand them off or
&gt;do they need cut out and replaced?

How deep are they.

&gt;have agroovr to hold them in. Are these held in with adhesive
&gt;and if so what kind? Thanks to all for their help....

I used 3M weldwood contact cement.
