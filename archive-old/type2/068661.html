&gt;and B) does any body out there have pros/cons on various suppliers of
&gt;replacement body tin? There are three or four, and I would like to know
&gt;which seem to use thicker steel, best values, etc.

Well, your'e not a Canuck, but I guess I'll make an exception...

Get your metal from Das Bulli Haus.  It fits better, its the right
