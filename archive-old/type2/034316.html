Hey there Robert, and list...

&gt; I still haven't been able to start the engine. After installation

&gt; any
&gt; ideas.

All of this is covered on the type2 list's page http://www.type2_dot_com,
Sean's &quot;Bartnotek&quot; page has helped me alot, see the library for links
to Sami's AFC troubleshooting page, search the archives, etc. I used
these web resources (and Muir, Bentley, Haynes) to figure out the FI
system. 

If the engine wants to fire but dies after 11 seconds (five or so
times), then the engine is only being supplied with fuel by the cold
start valve or when the starter is cranking. Does the exhaust smell
like gas ? 

The stock FI system works like this. You turn the key, which cranks
the starter. While the starter is cranking the fuel pump gets juice
from the starter (thru the double relay). Cold start valve gives a
squirt of fuel to get things going. The vacuume created by the engine
opens the flap in the AFC housing, which supplies the juice to the
fuel pump now. (the starter is no longer cranking or powering the
pump). This is how it works unless someone has &quot;hot wired&quot; the pump,
which is another thread covered in the archives.

Ok, now back to your question. Somehow or other fuel isn't continuing
to flow. You have checked to make sure the engine is getting spark,
right ? Also the FI system needs 9.6v to make everthing work. You
really need a freshly charged battery to troubleshoot the FI system,
ask me how I know. I removed the battery and charged it overnite
between troubleshooting sessions. Buy a voltmeter if you don't have
one already. A test light, or a 12v buzzer (cheap continuity tester)
will work too. (WE don't neeed no STINKEN scan tools !)

I got my 78 westy started for the first time by opening the flap in
the AFC. Removed the air filter and used a stick. Seems the flap was
closed from a backfire, and wasn't opening, triggering the power to
the pump. Used the stick (real high tech) to get the flap unstuck,
and she fired right up. Muir (and others) use a empty coffee can to
check the spray pattern of the injectors (*be careful*). But,I
wouldn't look at the injectors until the rest of the system is
checked first. There's alot of stuff before the injectors. Making
sure the pump is getting power is the first step. If you want to see
if the engine is getting fuel, remove a spark plug, you should smell
gas. Heck, pull all the plugs and check the compression. 

Hope This Helps,
