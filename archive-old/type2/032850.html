Subject: Re: Heater control box repairs

Marcus- Have I seen you in one of the eastern campouts?  On my very
funky heater box control box, (read shreds of rust) I encased it in a
layer of epoxy (the 5 min kind); I suspect JB weld would have worked
also.  Holds together the shape produced by the rusty bits, and Epoxy,
based on my using it on a woodstove, can withstand 500 degrees!
