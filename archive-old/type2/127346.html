Subject: Re: [T2] Horsepower Numbers

Don, don't get sucked into the whole &quot;horsepower&quot; thing like today's car manufacturers want us to.  You don't have a &quot;hemi!&quot;  Many of the newer cars have huge HP numbers but low torque (relative to the horsepower) because that's their market strategy.  &quot;Horsepower&quot; sounds more cool than &quot;Torque&quot; and they know that's what we've been trained to hear!  I feel torque ft/lbs should always be higher than the HP number (depending on the type of car obviously).
 
Look at the torque specs in those numbers, not the HP, and notice how the torque gets relatively larger AND is made at lower Revs as the T4 gets bigger- THAT is what counts!

Is this right?

http://www.tunacan_dot_net/t4/reference/case.htm

The range of HP from the 1.7 to the 2.0 is 63 to 70 in the Type2's?

There's gotta be more to the 2.0 than that...
