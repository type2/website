Subject: fuel pump (mechanical circa 1974)/sunroof alternative solution

On the way into work this morning all was fine
untill I started up &quot;the hill&quot; as I progressed up
DAS bus started loosing power untill it died. It
started right back up and off I went. It runs great at
idle and accelaration is fine for a while at least
then its starts to dog. I notice that the third
line off the fuel pump is wet so I am thinking the
diaphragm is failing allowing gas to the back side of
the pump and out the vent hose. This would, I assume,
rob me of the proper pressure from the pump.
  I recently bought a Mech. pump from the Bus Depot
as I couldn't pass up the price (and availabilty).
Soooo the question becomes.. other than grease in the
backside of the pump where it bolts to the engine do I
have to make any adjustments on a new pump for
diaphragm tension or is this new pump ready to bolt
on and go? (Ron?)
  On another project.. I gave up fighting the slider
sun roof... new cable no longer available among other
things. I decided to make it in to a popup section 
dormobile style. I installed marine stainless hatch 
hinges and found some polished aluminum strips. These
I have used as weather strip/support for the roof when
it is closed. They are attached to the slider roof
with
loctite adhesive and selfe tapping machine screws with
the flat head like you would use for trim. Installed
around the edge of the slider roof so that they extend
past the edge and onto the bus's roof it looks almost
like a stock installation (so far).
the only things left to do would be supports for when
the roof is up.. a latch for when it is down and a
canvas for when it is up an it is raining.
  So far I am realy happy with how this is progressing
and I feel it is a pretty simple solution and much
better than simply filling the gap with sealant and
forgetting the sun roof is there.
  I suppose if I lived in a sunnier area I would have
considered a canvas slider that mounts on slides to
the top of the bus.... but Seattle can get a little
damp from time to time.
  I am considering taking pictures and doing a step by
step procedure on my site if there is an interest.
  Having been with the Wet Westies for a while now I
finally will have a pop top too... no more pop top
envy! ;-) Nice to be able to stand up in the bus when
you are camping.. makes a lot of activities more enjoyable!
