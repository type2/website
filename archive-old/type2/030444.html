Volks,

First, I am in Modesto, CA, typing this in on Craig Saul's computer.  All
is well with the van, but see below.  I *love* this on-the-road repair
work (NOT!:-)  By the time I get back, the car may well be running like a
dream , and I may even have clear up some of the ulcers :-)

Second, During my visit to Mark Stephens, he recommended that I visit a
shop in Santee, CA that did tuning using a chassis dyno.  That machine
showed that I was running a hair lean (14:1 not 12:1) across the board.
Their suggested fix was (a) a programable FI computer for $700 or (b) an
adjustable fuel pressure regulator (AFPR) at $179.  The problem is that
tho I purchased the AFPR, it is for a Porsche 911, and came with two
compression inlets, for the dual fuel rails on that car, not the single
7mm hose barb that our engines use.  So I took the AFPR up the road a bit
to Craig's place in Modesto and E&amp;S Precision Machine (Elzner and *Sauls*
:-), where Craig turned out just the adapter and cap that I needed.  I
have now installed it and set it to 32psi as a preliminary setting.  It is
leak free and functional, but I need that chassis dyno back to do the
final setting :-( Alas, it is 400 miles south of me and I am due in
Seattle on Sunday/Monday, so that is out of the question.

Do any of you who live in or north of San Francisco, CA as far north as
Seattle know of a chassis dyno shop that would be willing to dial this
puppy in for me?
