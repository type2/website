I too need to thank Doc Stephens and Karl vS for the assist with my new =
bosch starter. I went with a NEW bosch to avoid headaches. It comes with =
only a single spade connecter on the solenoid.  You connect both the =
ignition and FI wire to it using a push-on splitter. I added the bosch =
hot-start relay kit for good measure.  It was cheap, can't hurt, may =
help, and for the first time in years,  the bus starts on one try.  I DO =
have to give it some gas and crank for a bit, but she fires on one try!
What should I check to make her start with no gas pedal, on the first =
try as it should? She has brand new, (all bosch): plugs, wires, cap =
,rotor, blue coil, starter, cold-start-valve, thermotime switch, hot =
start relay kit.  Ideas? I'd like to get it perfect!
