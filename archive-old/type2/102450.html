Subject: AVP longblock Rebuild: Head failure_at_ 15K: Update

Hello, here's a quick update on my saga:

My 82 Westie is out of the shop and I'm much poorer ($833.00) yet, with a
properly functioning engine and a new right head, somehow richer :-)

Today, I adjusted the rear brakes due to them feeling mushy...when that
didn't fix the problem I did a minor brake bleeding all round and that
firmed up the brake pedal just wonderfully. So my &quot;Hillbilly Hotel&quot;  is back
in it's usual excellent state of health ...good strong engine that starts
when I turn the key and runs smoothly. Good positive brakes so I can stop my
heavy vehicle without having to pump the brakes.......Life is good!

Now to set to the task of photocopying bills and packing up the old head to
send to AVP Worldwide to see if they agree with my mechanic that the head
was improperly rebuilt ...and to see if they will absorb some of the cost of
my having to get this repair done after a mere 15,000 miles on their
rebuild.....I have high hopes because most everyone here regards AVP quite
highly and they seem like an honest company.

      I'll keep you posted!

                    Robert  W.
