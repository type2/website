Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Short Shift Kit?

In a message dated 9/29/03 8:00:49 AM, sharpes_at_uncw_dot_edu writes:

&lt;&lt; I would like to find a short shift for the factory shifter on my bay.
The magazines are full of $6 short shift kits for beetles, but nowhere
can I find one that says it will fit buses. Is there really a difference
in the shifter base between the bus and the beetle? Is the buses'
shifter base larger?
 &gt;&gt;

IIRC, it was just the standard kit I had on a '71...Shortened the shift
feel, but not &quot;that&quot; much (everything else was worn/original). It did,
however, regularly require retightening...YMMV, of course...
