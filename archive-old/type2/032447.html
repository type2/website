Wow!  I am overwhelmed by the amount of responses I have received about the bay window parts.  I promise to get back with you all who have responded and in the order that you responded.  Early responders have snatched up the following items and these are now sold: Gauges w\ Clock, The folding table (but I may have another one, so, keep watching).  i will respond to you all, so hang in there!



Peace, John Baker
