You never realize how important that little strip of metal is until you
don't have one. 

I just bout a '77 Riviera camper, they guy i bought it from didn't know
much about it (much to my advantage). He said the previous owner blew the
motor driving over the continental divide and had it towed to the nearest vw
repair man where the current engine was put in. He says its a porche
engine. It is a type IV motor, but the dip stick is not where it's suppose
to be. It goes straight up and right next to the oil fill, which i don't
think is in the same place as original either, it goes straight up and is
back behind the fan, sort of where it would be on a type I motor, without
the alternator, come to think of it the dip stick is kind of the same
place as a Type I motor too.

So my problem is when i bought it i was told that the dip stick broke
off. After i looked at it, the dip stick thats in there is out of a
domestic car and was cut off, presumably to replace a lost dip stick, but
the dip stick that was in there is cut to short and it doesn't touch oil. 
I went to U-Pull It and got a new dip stick, but i have no idea where to
mark it full. Someone had the idea of get out the factory manual and
change the oil and put the dip stick in and mark that as full, but I'm not
even sure what kind of engine this is so maybe it takes a different
amount of oil? And it just had an oil change so that seems wasteful. 

Does anyone have an engine like this? Is it from a 914? If so could
someone please please measure from the top of the dip stick down to where
the full and low mark are and let me know what they are. 

If no one can identify it from my vague description i could get picture up on
a web site if i can talk a friend into letting me use his digital camera. 


thanks

eli
