Subject: Ahhh... finally - progress!

Finally. The kids are in school, the fiancee is at work, the lawn is mown 
(mowed?) Just me, The Terrapin Flyer, and some power tools. Finally got to 
the cargo floor with a disc sander, sandblaster and a wire brush to get the 
tiny bit of surface rust out. I plan on coating this with a rubber 
&quot;undercoating.&quot; Any obejections from the group out there? I don't plan on 
showing the Flyer, nor do I intend on selling it (so that I can be known as a 
PO!?). Just wondering if this will cause any heat problems. The reason behind 
this is 1.) To protect the floor while I finish the interior, and 2.) to keep 
road noise down (if possible). I plan on putting the original Westy floor 
back in with some carpet on top. Should never bee seen by human eyes again.

TIA
