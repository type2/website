Subject: bleeding the clutch

anyone have any tips on how to bleed the clutch
efficiently.  I am about at 40 pumps and there is
still air in there.  let me preface that I removed the
engine and tranny and kept the clutch on the tranny so
the line was left open.  drained some fluid but not
too much.  just put the engine back in and can't get
fluid to fill up the line. is there a way to back fill
it or something,its hard to get someone to step on and
off the clutch for an hour at a time.

Keep it positive
