Subject: Re: [T2] Rust removal

&gt;We had a DR friend that used it
&gt;and he had to work for a few days with the POR on his hands and had to
&gt;explain to his patients what it was.

I'd have told them it was something he caught from a patient but don't 
worry - it isn't contagious - now.... &lt;grin&gt;
