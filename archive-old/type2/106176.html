&gt; Reading the post on nose repair made me remember I had a question for this
&gt; area of the Bus. I have the holes up front for the tire mount on my 70 Westy,
&gt; and I picked one up last year to mount there. I took off the inside kick
&gt; panels, mine are wood, to get access to the front from behind. I didn't have
&gt; much time to work at it, but I could not see how to get at the area where the
&gt; mount goes. Can anyone describe the procedure?

There is practically no clearance between the nose and the air ducting to
work with.

I've never mounted one but I will have to do it in future. My kit came with
molly bolts (sleeve-type hollow wall anchors) assuming you'd only have
access from the outside but the original mount looks like the bolts are
secured from behind...I'd like to know how it was put on also.
