hey y'all
I'm about ready to put the engine back in the Award Winning Burrito Express.
Took it out for a retorque of heads and case.  The 8mm case studs that are
supposed to be 14 ft/lbs were about 4 and the 112mm studs were9, suppoesed
to be 24.  A years hard running and 30k miles.  Heads were about 1-3 ftlb
loose on a couple of studs, consistent with how she's been since build.

My alternator shaft where the key for the pulley sets is wallered.  Enough
to give a slight amount of play.  If I were to change it, now is the time
before I put it in.  My question is, what caused this?  Any ideas folks?

Also, went up to Blowing Rock (NC) today ;cause Mom's up to viit and she
wanted to see it.  Saw a green baywindow with a boat on the top, also saw a
yellow and white splittie.  Any listees?
