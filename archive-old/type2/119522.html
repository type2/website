&gt;I've received quite a bit of private e-mail about my procedure for

&gt;have expressed the concern about the extra torque placed on the top 
&gt;swivel mount bolt in the event of an accident.  The extra torque could 
&gt;come from the fact that a longer bolt and spacer are used.

The euro busses with factory retractable belts had the swivel d-buckle. How did it rotate and clear the body?
