&gt; 2) there is a splitty in a new travelocity commercial.

I saw this while visiting family over the Thanksgiving holiday.  
Luckily, TiVo trapped it for me, and I snapped a picture of the TV 
screen with the Bus in frame.  It's on my wife's camera; I'll post it 
later, once she's slurped all the pictures off of it.

...and I was having a beer with Richard Atwell last evening, and that 
very same Travelocity ad appeared on the TV at the bar.

I must say, if I had a splitty with a &quot;Yellow Submarine movie&quot;-style 
paint job, I wouldn't complain one bit :-)
