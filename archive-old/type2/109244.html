Subject: Re: [T2] Stuck in 2nd...

Jim,

From personal experience I'd say that your clutch cable is going/gone. ( As
I remember, 2nd/Reverse were all Tigger was happy with when her clutch cable
went, too. )

They seem to &quot;slip&quot; when a number of the strands go, but pretty much give a
&quot;limp home&quot; made if you put a few turns on the adjuster.

As she's home, I'd say get a new clutch cable and that should be all you
need.

&gt; While I was sitting at the stoplight I tried to shift from 4th back into
&gt; 1st. It seemed to get stuck in neutral. I could get it into reverse, but
no
&gt; forward gears. I finally fiddled with it enough to get it into 2nd.
Luckily
&gt; I didn't live far so I could drive her home in that gear. Now she's stuck
&gt; in that gear.
&gt;
&gt; She's a 1971 with a tranny from a 1969.  Has anyone had this problem. Is
it
&gt; a tough fix?
