well found out what the expensive noise was today

took out my left rear bearings.

got new bearings coming but just found out the stub axle is damaged

can't get a hold of my usual sources (suspects)

in any case, anyone in the mid Atlantic area have a 78 stub axle in decent
shape handy?????

thanks
Bob
