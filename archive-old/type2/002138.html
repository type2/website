Subject: high oil pressure, dead engine

For all of you following along on the strange and terrible saga of my 70
Westy, an update follows. First a brief recap:
Driving along, VDO oil pressure gauge shoots up off the scale, engine dies.
Won't restart.

Initial tinkering has revealed nothing. No apparent mechanical problems, no
loss of oil. I assume a spike in oil pressure would cause the main seal to
blow, spewing oil all over the place. Not the case here.

Compression check reveals nothing. 110 pounds in all cylinders. As I
suspected. A VW will run pretty darn strong on just three cylinders, but
only for 3/4 as long :&gt;

No electical shorts are evident. Removed the possibly offending VDO oil
pressure sending switch, replaced with stock unit, no luck.

Can't check the spark because I don't have someone to turn the engine over
for me. Will soon.

Changed the condenser for giggles. Nothing. Points are next, followed by the
coil.

Very strange.

BTW: I also run a VDO oil temp sensor mounted in the sump, and a VDO tach.
At first I thought the big wire that connects the tach may have come loose
or shorted, but I can't find evidence of either scenario.

BBTW: For all you out there running Michelin LT4 light truck tires: I
experienced a catastrophic failure of one of my rear tires as the bus was
under tow. The tread completely separated from the tire, which I didn't
notice because I was in my U-Haul, and the tire proceeded to disintegrate in
a puff of blue smoke. When I finally pulled over the rim was smoking
hot--hot enough to burn the paint off the rim,hot enough to start a fire.
Almost melted one of my Koni Gas-Adjust shocks. These tires have less than
5,000 miles on them. I wonder if they were made under contract by
Firestone...
