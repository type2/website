Subject: ...of weights and measures ?

I have a 1600/71 with a &quot;residential&quot; interior........thing is I am off to
Europe to collect a large amount of stone blocks for carving. Approx. 1-1.5
kilo blocks.
Considering that there will be myself, my wife and our baby daughter Isis,
how much can I get ( kilos please ) and still maintain safety and engine
tolerance limits......thank god no mountains on the way !!!
Is there a safe place to put these that I should know about.......sounds a
strange question, but I'm sure someone has used their bus to haul stuff
before.
Also, is there a direct relation to the amount of air in your tyres and the
amount of weight in your bus ??
Any help appreciated
