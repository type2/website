Subject: Re: [T2] R: [T2] Trash into oil

For the sake of a nice discussion! ;-)))
Calm down David, ok, ok, ok you are right, drive whatever you like ;-)))

I will stay very polite because i have a lot of respect for the type2
list, but the subject is very interesting.

&gt;&gt;&gt;OH MY GOD, THE SKY IS FALLING!!!!  :)&lt;&lt;&lt;
i guess.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Didn't you drive your bus thousands of miles last year?&lt;&lt;&lt;
Yes i did!

&gt;&gt;&gt;If you really feel that strongly about being wasteful,&lt;&lt;&lt;
yes i do

&gt;&gt;&gt;sell your bus and drive your Civic to Mexico next time.  You can sleep
outside in a tent!  You will be helping the environment!&lt;&lt;&lt;

Did you ever did a 2 months trip in a tent when moving each day (painful!),
that why i own a Bus, easy to move, park, drive. like you all know, it take 10
minutes to pack in the morning and up you go... well, not in my case, in
average it took me 1 hour just to start the bus, another 15 minutes of warmup
(polluting each campground at the same time as i was not &quot;Burning&quot; 40% of the
fuel). If i have known better... I guess you already know that i've owned a
Vanagon before (for the same purpose, traveling), i sold it because i thought
that the little Bus would be as usefull, cost less and be as economicaln (the
Vanagon was doing 280miles on a tank). I was dead wrong. You are right, a
small car with a tent would be the most logical choice, or even better, a
airplane ticket with a rental, but hey! i wouldn't have met all those nice
folks with big car along the way that help my sorry butt, i wouldn't have seen
those beutiful isolated place along the way. So that's why i owned a Bus, i
should say a camper.

 &gt;&gt;&gt;Oh I understand your point completely - I just don't agree with it
and I think you are being hypocritical and naive.&lt;&lt;&lt;

I don't think i am, well, i hope not! It's your right to disagree. At
least we are not fighting ;-)

 &gt;&gt;&gt;I fully agree that our westy are pollutant, but my Civic is 3 time
less pollutant than your SUV
---My SUV is 100 times less polluting than your bus.----&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

He he, we are funny now, my dad is stronger than yours, he he he :-))))))

 &gt;&gt;&gt;You will when you have a head-on collision with one. Mass = safety,
that cannot be argued against. What is more important to you, saving gas
or saving your life? How about the life of your girlfriend? You know the
answer&lt;&lt;&lt;

I own Motorcycle David, life is very scary sometime, that's what life is
all about, at  least for me!!!  My girl drive a bike too :-)  Ok, so i
guess i should go buy an Hummer!  Why do you think i bought a comlete FI
for my bus, 2 reason; one is EASY START, and the second one is that my
bus stop smelling &quot;fuel&quot;. anyway, i hope!

 &gt;&gt;&gt; if you say &quot;saving gas&quot; then I think you are being hypocritical
again.&gt;&gt;&gt;
????, do i have to go buy a bigger car now, am confuse.

 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;We bought the SUV because it weighs 5,500lbs and when some drunk in
a little 2,500lb car hits it, their family will be the one picking out
grave markers, not us.&lt;&lt;&lt;

That is my whole point here! lets all buy bigger car for safety, lets
built bigger car, bigger, stronger, more dangerous and bigger!!!!!!!!!
Why not all buy smaller car instead, so the colision will be equal and
at the same time we will polute our planet a bit less... Nice way of
thinking!

 &gt;&gt;&gt;Sure it's your right. But you're being hypocritical. Heck if you
REALLY care about the environment, trade your Civic in for a Civic
Hybrid or Honda Insight (~1.5 or 2x as efficient as your Civic,
respectively). If you REALLY TRULY care about the environment, sell your
bus and ride a bike!&lt;&lt;&lt;

I guess am hypocritical! (if you say so). A Civic is a good start, i
always owned Civic, it's my fourth one since 85'(average is 5 years
each), before i owned a Renault5, 1.3liter. Am really thinking about the
Hybrid, like i said in a previous post, my sister just bought one, very
fine car by the way. But she is probably stupid, she as 2 youngs child!
Ho, by the way, i drive my bike (bicycle) to work 3 times a week when i
work at my warehouse, it's only 5 miles. Good to stay in shape too... I
take my car to work only 1 time a week to check our stores, when i go
downtown, i take the Bus &amp; Metro.

 &gt;&gt;&gt; I'm not going to spend any more time trying to change your mind.&lt;&lt;&lt;
You won't change my mind on that very delicate but interesting subject David

 &gt;&gt;&gt;But I don't like it when people get on a soapbox about saving the
environment while they drive around in a 30-year old polluting,
inefficient dangerous vehicle.&lt;&lt;&lt;
(it's funny, do you remember the add from Honda, an Insight was at a
stop sign, beside was an old poluting VW Bus, he he he he)

Am just trying to do my share as a human beeing, nothing else, am far
from beeing an environmentalist!
Am working on my &quot;poluting Bus&quot; problem, ho yes, am working hard on it,
it will be far from perfect but at least am doing my best.
http://pages.infinit_dot_net/engine/weber.htm (injection is next, if i keep
the Bus)

 &gt;&gt;&gt;Just suck it up and admit that driving a bus (or a Civic, or
anything with an Internal Combustion Engine) is more important to you
than saving the environment, and admit that others have the right to do
the same if they please. &lt;&lt;&lt;

????, not sure what you mean here, but others have the right to do what
ever they want, of course, it's a free country. I also have the right to
express my point of view, that all my friend.

 &gt;&gt;&gt;If you don't like the laws of your country&lt;&lt;&lt;
Well, mmm, i was born in Boston, i still have my dual citizenship, where
and why should i move, it's very nice here?

OK, i guess Friday is done (he he), i will go and enjoy my weekend in
 beautiful NH, and i hope, in my new and improve Westy.

Sorry if i ofended anyone, no arm intended here, just trying to express
my opinion on a subject that i care.
David, have a nice weekend with your family.

Regards.
