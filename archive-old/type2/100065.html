The foam in your side air vents and the front air flaps is turning the same

Any online VW vendor carries an exact replacement for about $20.

Part number is 411 813 225. The foam can be installed the wrong way.  The
right way is with the more porous spongy foam side up and the solid &quot;darker&quot;
colored side down.
