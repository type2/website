Is there  a secret or magic trick to splitting a T4 case?  Why do the long  
case
bolts not come out all the way?



Hey dave  the one that really hides is the oil pick-up tube bolt  middle of 
the case above the push rod tubes . Don't worry about the 6 big center  case 
bolts you can remove tham after splitting. Also there are 2 ten mm nuts at  the 
oil breather stand that have to be removed. Be careful and don't force  
anything between the case, you should be able to tap the case apart with a small  
hammer tapping on the notches at the bottom.  later and have fun  mark  Dearing
