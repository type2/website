Subject: [T2] Engine Seized


&gt; Brand new Type 1 engine in a 71 Bus, about 350 miles.  I built it myself,
&gt; and it was running great.....The big question is, do I now own a $2000 paper
&gt; weight shaped like a VW engine, or can I save this thing?  I've never had a
&gt; seized engine of any kind, so I have no idea what to do, or what to expect
&gt; to see when I open the case.

Split the case now. The damage will be obvious.
The longer you wait, the less your SO will.
Drain the oil first, if you want to see shrapnel.
Otherwise, it will still be there when you get inside.
Assess damage, order parts, reassemble.
Pay attention to details. Take notes.
