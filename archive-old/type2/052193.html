Or better yet, measure off 10 degrees starting at the 7.5
mark. Do it twice, and you are at 27.5!

--------------
The pulley has a notch at 0 deg, 7.5 deg BTDC, and 10 deg BTDC.
With the notches at the top of the pulley, the 0 deg notch is the
leftmost one. Get a string and use it to measure the distance from
the 0 notch to the 10 notch. Now measure off that same distance
from the 10 notch and you are at 20 deg BTDC. Put a mark there
with a pen, liquid paper, or whatever. Now measure the distance
from the 20 mark (that you just made) and you are at 30 deg BTDC.
Put a mark there as well. Measure it all again to make sure it
is right. When you are sure, use the edge of a file to make
yourself a new notch at 30 degrees.
