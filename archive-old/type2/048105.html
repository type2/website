Subject: [T2] bad engine miss???

I have a 78 Westy, 2.0L FI, it has been running fine, but has just developed a very bad miss. At first, this was not a daily thing, but, since, has gotten to be fairly regular.  It will not start missing at first, but after a short warm up will start, and is then very rythmic, and very hard, specially on excelleration and in the lower gears, but is also very rythmic in 4th gear.  We are thinking this might be the fuel pump, has any one else had experience with this?  Any  ideas will be greatly appreciated.
