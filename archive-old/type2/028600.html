Folks,

My beloved bus is on the road again. The problem was a rusty gas tank.
Clogged fuel filter every two days was a dead give-away.

One problem remains. The ignition lock does not always turn all the way to
&quot;start&quot; position. I ordered a new lock cylinder, but forsee a small problem.

The Bentley manual says that there should be a screw in the lock cylinder
housing that releases the cylinder from the housing. They also say that on
some models (like mine) the screw is not exposed and that I will need to
drill a hole.

No problem, but how do I know where to drill?

P.S. So far, I have not had to explain why I am driving with the ignition
switch hanging out to the local police ;-)
