Subject: [T2] problem

I have a 72 bus with a t4 engine in it.  It has a single double barrel Weber 
in it.  On tuesdaymy friend and I hopped in the bus to go to my aunts house 
in Massachusettes which is about a 3 1/2 hour drive.   The bus ran fine until 
we stopped at about the half way point to go to the bathroom.  I left the car 
running while we went.  We came back out and got back on the road.  About a 
1/2 hour down the road the bus started to I guess bog out, like no gas was 
getting to the engine.  So now the bus is slowing down and I don't know what 
to do so I started to pull over and it kicked back in and I started going 
again.  This happened about every minute so I forced the bus to go the rest 
of the trip.  When we arrived at our destination I went to a gas station and 
got some dry gas thinking that our problem was because moisture in the tank.  
The dry gas helped a lot and I'm thinking of getting another one because the 
bus still does it but only at higher rpm's.  I would like to get a solution 
on this before I leave to go
 back to jersey tomorrow (Friday).  So if anyone can please help it is much 
appreciated. 

Thank You
Jon
