Subject: compression results:( ...was what happened?

hey volks,
well i took the afternnon off from work and di the
compression test.   the results were:(  
#1) 0
#2) 110
#3) 110
#4) 105
so all were a little low, but #1 seemed
excessive:)(trying to keep a positive attitude)  so i
squirted some oil into #1 and retested and it came up
to 45.   so looks like lizzy isnt going anywhere for a
while.   so am i to assume its bad rings, seeing ive
heard no expensive noises, or???   what should my next
step be, repair if i can, or rebuild, or new motor.
this is an 1800 w/ a set(2) of AVP heads w/ less than
3000 miles on the heads.   mileage on the motor is
unknown.   when i bought this a little over a year ago
the compression was about 120+ or - 5 all the way
around.   ughhhh, guess ill be working hard on this
thing if i want to take it cross country in july.
bummed,
