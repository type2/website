&gt;&gt;The new roof looks amazing - ok a little rough but i havent done the
&gt;bondo on the seem thing yet - but it sure looks good - no longer caved
&gt;in, new supports etc.. man - it is   BEAUTIFUL - and the line of the
&gt;roof is perfect - absolutely perfect

sounds NICE. what about leading the seams instead of bondo? real men
don't use bondo...
