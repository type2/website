Good evening, all (time zone variances noted!)

I am wondering if anyone on list has experience/information about AVP
Worldwide. My 74 Riviera came with a 1800 long block that had been built by
AVP, which I installed about 1200 miles ago. According to the paperwork it
is a 1.8ltr, hyd lifter, FI Case, 210 flywheel, That's all I know about it
and i've had some trouble getting ahold of AVP for more details.

Here's the question: is AVP known for using hemi cut or semi-hemi cut heads?
I ask because the puppy seems to run best when timed out to around 36ATC at
3500 rpm. That's awfully high for a stock set-up, but in range for a
modified head. (Anybody else see Jake's bit on hemi cuts in VW Trends?) I
don't want to tear up my engine, but it runs much stronger with the advanced
timing and seems to get better MPH as well.

Any info out there?

TIA,
Dave
74 Transporter/Riviera.
