Subject: Re: [T2] Nose emblem question

Hello Brandt,

I guess that the mounted emblem of white plastic is the right one for your
bus. It should be the smaller version of the emblem. Only early bays have
the bigger emblems mounted. You could upgrade to a chrome emblem but those
were only original on deluxe buses.

Subject: [T2] Nose emblem question


&gt; Hello all,
&gt;
&gt; I have a 78 Sagegreen westy to be painted next week.
&gt;
&gt; However, I want to put a VW emblem on the front but don't know what style
&gt; was ever stock on a 78 Sagegreen Westy. My 79 Sagegreen westy had a very
&gt; weathered white one. Was this used in 78? If so where can I get one?
&gt;
&gt; Or was a chrome one ever used on sagegreen westies? Anyways I'd like to
&gt; figure it out soon because It just dawned on me that if holes need to be
&gt; drilled it might be best done prior to painting for rust prevention. Just
&gt; trying be come close to what was original. Thanks in advance.
