Subject: Re: very poor FI gas mileage????

Bob,

This is a big drop in mileage, yet your grey plugs (you checked them all,
right?) suggest it is not running rich. Since you don't mention any fuel
smell or large puddles under the bus, my next step would be to suspect
measurement errors:
(1) Second-to-last fill-up may not have been topped off.
(2) Pump at gas station may have sold you air bubbles.
(3) A broken gear tooth on your odometer will cause intermittant pauses and
underestimate distance actually travelled.

Sami
