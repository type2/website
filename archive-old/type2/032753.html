Subject: Ye Olde Bent Rod? (long)

Volks,

When i tore down the 1800 in my 74 bus, i marked the connecting rods with the
number of the cylinder that they were from and which direction was up.  I was
careful to do this correctly because i did not do it on my last tear-down and
regretted it.

Well, when i reinstalled the rods with new bearings, i did it with a local 'VW
guru' and we installed them with the stamp marks (the numbers stamped into the
cap and rod) -UP- meaning they face the top of the case when properly
installed. We did not observe my teardown marks and on numbers 1, 3 and 4 they
corresponded with the stamped numbers; both my marks and the stamps were up. 

We torqued all of the rods down and after 'seating' them, all of them were
tight so that when you lift the rod and drop it, it falls slowly and comes to
rest on the bottom of the bore lightly - they way it is upposed to with new
bearings - EXCEPT for #2.  #2 was loose.  My mechanic and i agreed that we
would address this issue at another time.

I had a dream one night after this that i had installed all of the rods upside
down.  

When i got the case home and decided to address the loose #2 rod, i found that
my teardown marks were infact upside down, but the stamp on the cap and rod
were up.

Hmmm.

The #2 piston was the one that had the broken ring land between the #2 comp
ring and the oil ring.

Hmmmmmmm.

My friend tells me about the discussion in the Wilson book about the
connecting rod offset and about what an upside-down rod can do.

HMMMMmmmm.

I removed the rod and flipped it over so that my marks are up and the stamps
are down.

Still - loose when torqued to 24-26 ft lbs.

I removed the rod and assembled it off the crank.  The cap and rod can be
seated completely by hand with very little effort- the rods from my other 1800
have to be tapped into place to seat completely, as do all of the other rods
in this engine.

I tried installing the #2 rod from my other 1800 - i can't get that SOB to
torque yet because the only 1/2&quot; sockets i have are those black 'impact'
sockets and the wall of the 14mm is too big to fit in the 'scoop' on the rod
around the nut - i can't get a good enough bite on the rod nut to get above
about 20 lbs.  I will get proper socket soon.

I assembled the rod and bearing (twice - the original and the new one) off the
crank and tightened the nuts down - the rod and cap do seat completely with
the new bearing in place.

So. Questions: 

1. Was the original rod installed upside-down on the last rebuild resulting in
a bent rod and broken piston?

2. Should the #2 rod from my other 75 1800 torgue down okay? It appears to
have been installed properly in the original engine and shouldn't be bent.

Thanks,

Clark Gordon

Morehead, Ky.
