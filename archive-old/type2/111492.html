poles are retractable???????
I'll be....  how does that work?
Do they twist or something to collapse??&lt;&lt;

Frank, yes, on the later models (i'm sure someone will know
exactly which years) each pole was made out of 2 pieces
of metal. one was just skinnier than the other &amp; it worked
like a slide to adjust the width.  as the scanned image
suggests, this was to accomodate storage under the z-bed
in a specially designed slot.

my first bus, a '74 Westy, had this feature.
