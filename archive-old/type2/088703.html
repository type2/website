Subject: Re: [T2] I guess it's not wrong after all

Considering how many VW buses just get used up and tossed by unimaginative
and undedicated owners, this is a really exciting way to do something
different with a bus.. That thing is beautiful, and I would have never
imagined that they could handle speeds of 275 MPH!!! Really awesome!
I love stock VWs too, but there's room for everybody to do their
thing...stock and modified.
Considering that there's not much between you and the road ahead, those guys
have some big brass knobs to do 275.. and the engine had more? Wow!
