&gt; So I went with a friend who wanted to buy a new car:
she did buy a Passat though

went to service about a recall I found on my van from the DOT
website.  (78 Steering gearbox)  he told me he would check up on it and
get back to me, still waiting

&gt; SO I went out to the salesman. (He had no idea I was irritating the parts 
&gt; guys BTW)
&gt; 
&gt; I had my son with me. He's three and I dont test drive with him, so I say, 
&gt; as we are looking at a sporty new VW,  &quot;I would test it, but my son is with 
&gt; me...&quot; He says I can not test drive that car. I sit down inside it and 
&gt; laugh, well come back later to test it, it feels nice as I play with the 
&gt; gears and what not. He says, &quot;No you cannot ever test drive this car, nobody 
&gt; is allowed to&quot;. I look at him like he's crazy, and say why not?

???? huh, what VW is that???

I test drove a Eurovan a couple two years back and I really liked it, but
the $28k price tag scared me off

&gt; I then ask for specs. Then (I was with a friend whos dad is from Germany) I 

did they give you a spec sheet?
I know some places that they require a security to drive the limited
edition cars, but not at all, I've never heard of that 

&gt; I will buy a Toyota. Thank you for helping me make the decision.

well after visiting the VW lot and getting pretty much the same run around
I bought my wife a Saturn  ;8*{
