&gt; &gt; I did the exact process that Bentley describes and officially have the
&gt; same
&gt; &gt; brakes I had when I removed all the fluid.

&quot;If you stomp first and your reservoir is low you may introduce air into the
master cylinder then you'll have to bench bleed it.&quot; - Ratwell_dot_com

The greatest single cause of atheism in the world today is Christians, who
acknowledge Jesus with their lips and walk out the door, and deny Him by
their lifestyle. That is what an unbelieving world simply finds
unbelievable.
