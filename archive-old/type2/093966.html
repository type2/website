Subject: Re: [T2] LPG and Power

[...]
I am still examining changing my vanagon over but the price tag is still 
out of my reach.  waiting on answers from some people in england and 
italy that have converted the WC vangons. an 83.5 and a 85,

timing and compression are usually adjusted for lpg.  from a local rep 
it is usually 3 deg advance.  compression increase on aircooled is 
advised and this is usually done at the head.  price wise lpg may be 
partially linked to oil but it is primarily still a marketed waste 
product.  it is still exempt from almost all federal and state 
transportation taxes.

&gt; that, more compression and change the timing
&gt; it works , but not sure why you would want to go to the trouble here in 
&gt; the
&gt; USA ,
&gt; as LPG - Propane is based on oil prices anyway
