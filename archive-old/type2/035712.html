&lt;&lt;There is a problem with saying &quot;all of&quot; anywhere around buses :-)  As far
as I know/have seen, the 68-72 Deluxe (poptop) Westfalia camping
conversions were based on sunroof bodies.  The 1973 was *not*.&gt;&gt;

My '74 Campmobile IS based on the sunroof model.  The drain holes and gutters are still in place.
