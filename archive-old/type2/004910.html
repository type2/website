Subject: New tyres
Date: Mon, 2 Apr 2001 22:06:10 +0200
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I'm about to replace the tyres on my van and have read all I could find
on the subject in the Type2_dot_com library. The best I can find in my area
are Goodyear Cargo Vector (185R14 C) which seem to be ideal, they are 8
ply and have max load of over 800kg each. I can't find any reviews of
these tyres on the net and they are not listed on the Goodyear site, do
any of the list members have any experience with them? I tended to think
that all tyres are the same but the more I read the more it seems that
this is not the case.

Any feedback would be much appreciated.
