Subject: VW Bus designed for...

To be sure, one of the funniest sites I remember seeing as a kid  
growing up in Europe was a 70-something Westy struggling to stay on  
the Autobahn in the far right lane as big Mercedes and even some  
trucks went zooming by at triple-digit (MPH, not KPH) speeds. We had  
a 1972 BMW Bavaria that was a dragster compared to any bus.

Suburbs...funny term for someone who grew up across the pond!

I wonder how weird it would look if I put a window in the top/front  
of my High Top to give it that great &quot;Olds Vista Cruiser&quot; look to it.

Or is that considered blasphemous?

&gt; Hi Kevin,
&gt;
&gt; The VW bus was not designed for rural or recreational use. It was  
&gt; designed as an all-purpose vehicle from 1968-79. It was even  
&gt; branded as a &quot;Station Wagon&quot;. There were no sport-utes back then,  
&gt; and the market was pretty simple: Sports cars, Jeeps,  Muscle Cars,  
&gt; and everything else. The VW Bus was very much an &quot;Everything Else&quot;  
&gt; vehicle, and was just as useful in the suburbs as out on the farm.
