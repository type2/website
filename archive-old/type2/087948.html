Subject: Re: [T2] Bizarre mutant VW-Ford Stretch! 

C'mon! Buy it! Such a bargain at that price. Talk about a crazy toy! A VW
pimpmobile! I'm near Santa Barbara and maybe I could pick it up for you! I'd
love to see reports of it's road adventures on line. Now THIS is something
that I might consider living in, but it would be hard to be discreet about
it. LOL. Jan B
