Now I love giving advice and helping everyone out and getting help.  But when 
someone tells you after writing how to fix a problem, please at least 
entertain me by going outside and trying the troubleshot yourself.  If the 
problem is not solved on your Westy or bus then, continue to ask for help but 
at least let us know you tried our advice.
Peace Out
