&gt; Awhile back, someone on the list stated they were &quot;building&quot; Led pods for VW
&gt; vans.  Can that person contact me, since I am doing similar work, and have run
&gt; into problems, and maybe that persons knowledge will help me avoid some
&gt; &quot;issues&quot;, in this endeavor.  Thanks


I have put LED taillights on my 78 bus, tail and brake anyway..... working
on the write up but holidays have me backed up a bit... is that what you
were talking about...??
