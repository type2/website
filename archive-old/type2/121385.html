&gt;I've received quite a bit of private e-mail about my procedure for 
&gt;putting Vanagon seat belts into a bay window Bus/Westy.  Some people

&gt;swivel mount bolt in the event of an accident. 

I am not concerned about this.  It is a very large bolt and we're talking about moving the bracket out, what... a few mm?

&gt;I performed a couple of non-scientific tests, with the result being 
&gt;that I want to eliminate that spacer and go back to the short bolt

I'd love to hear more about those tests.

&gt;I changed my major from M.Eng to CS precisely because I wasn't very 
&gt;good at the math :-)

That's funny - so did I!

&gt;My plan, then, is to trim just enough of the lip using a Dremel with a 
&gt;metal cutting wheel (well, probably a 10-pack of wheels :-) from the 
&gt;door post that the Vanagon top swivel has the clearance it needs.  This 
&gt;doesn't look like it will be very hard to do at all.

Ahhhh, now you're going to get people telling you you're weakening the B-pillar by doing that!  Guess you'd better just stick with the stock belts... NOT.  :)
