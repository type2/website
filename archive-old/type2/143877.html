Subject: Re: [T2] Engine tune up

might be wrong but i always use a small dab of the stuff that comes in a little packet at the auto parts store..... put a smal dab on the threaded end of plug so that next time i change them i dont have to worry about one breaking from age or just being a pain in the butt to come out....
pack of stuff 50 cents...
no broken or busted up elbows or knuckles or broken plugs
PRICELESS
 
peace and love
my two cents worth

Hi,

I read your advice to put nothing on spark plugs when installing them. I was
told to put cupper spray on it to prevent them being stuck in their gap.
Wrong?

And as we leave in two months for a ride of about 15.000 km, how regular do
you advice to tune up the engine, considering that we did not drive much kms
last years?

BTW, it's a 1600.

Tx and Belgian greetings,
Bart



Peace and Love
Chris
