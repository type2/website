Subject: red early bay in San Mateo yesterday?

Hi all,
I was driving down El Camino Real in San Mateo yesterday around lunchtime
and I spotted a VERY nice red '68-'70 Westy.  Had an interesting exhaust, it
looked stock with the small tailpipe exiting toward the left side but it
also had another matching outlet on the right side.

Does this one belong to anyone here on the list? :-)
