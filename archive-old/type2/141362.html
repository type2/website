Subject: Re: [T2] new cip1 1600 longblock

&gt; Mexican case I bought from CB in 1975 was dual relief. Did they go back to
&gt; single?

All cases since the mid/late 1980's have been made in Brazil.  In fact, they
are all made from the same casting blocks.  However, cases for the Brazilian
market are machined as single relief and all those for the Mexican market
are dual relief.

If the new engine, in question, is a 'true' domestic Brazilian engine (the
one pictured on the Cip1 site is not a domestic Brazil engine) then there
are more oddities about it than just the single relief case.  The
description sounds like a Mexican unit, as the photo, so I would check that
it really is a Brazilian (look at the head under the rocker gear).
