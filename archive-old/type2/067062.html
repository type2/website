&gt; &gt; My concern is about safety.  Since you take off all the plugs, and lay the

I read something in Wilson's book last night about grounding the hot wire
to prevent damage to the computer brain (if you have one) or the VDO
clock, I suppose if you don't. I'm like Clara... I get a little nervous
with electrical stuff, so don't take any advice from me. I'm thinking &quot;if
I ground the wire and then lean on the frame, won't I get a charge through
me?&quot;

Ummmm...that makes me a little nervous. Who ever said ignorance was bliss?

Good luck! Joe
