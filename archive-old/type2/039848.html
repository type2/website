Subject: Canvas Installation

Just installed my the canvas on my 77 Westy...whew I'm glad that's over. I 
yelled and screamed a lot. The canvas I bought from bus depot fit like a 
glove. One addition I would make to the instructions is instead of using 
3/8&quot; staples get some 1/2&quot; or 9/16&quot; ones. Another thing that helped on the 
job was a $30 stanley power stapler, drove em' all the way home, even 
throught the petrified plastic.
