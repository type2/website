Very interesting.

If the threads matched up OK that would indicate the threads on the water
tank filler neck are US spec.

A lot of the bits and pieces in Westfalia interiors are actually of US
origin, but it hadn't occurred to me that might include the water tank and
its fittings.

Did you provide a small hole/opening to vent air into the tank?

&gt;&gt;      I made a cap for my '73s water tank using a trreaded plastic ring
from a kit made to repair the trap under a sink. I found a chrome disk, that
I believe is part of a shower drain stopper, then glued it into the ring
using food grade silicon. Fits great, and looks nice.  &lt;&lt;
