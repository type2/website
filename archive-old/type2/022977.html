I am planning on doing this as well at some point in the future. I am not 
sure where I am going to attach them yet though. I have a riviera 
conversion, and there are no seat belts on the back bench. I would like to 
put two 3 point belts and two lap belts back there. (The bench seats four 
quite comfortably if not safely right now.) Anybody have suggestions.

I don't recommend using old seat belts. Part of the safety of the seat belt 
comes from it's ability to stretch in an accident. As a seat belt ages that 
stretch goes away. This leads to cracked ribs and other nasties in an 
accident. I suggest you consider shelling out the cash for new ones. You 
can get them from JC Whitney:

http://jcwhitney_dot_com/item.jhtml?ITEMID=20489

I just bought 2 new ones for the front of my car. The where easy to 
install, and are nicer than the stock because they retract. I am very happy 
with them.
