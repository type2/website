I was going to wait until after I finally wrote my trip report from this
summer and get reacquainted with the list, but it looks like my bus has
other plans. My girlfriend and I recently moved to the Burlington area of
Vermont. We are looking into getting another car, but at the moment the bus
is the only mode of transportation. I was bringing my girlfriend to a job
interview yesterday when the clutch return spring broke. I know I could
easily change it but..... The apartment complex we just moved into has a
snow cover slanted parking lot, and is not to keen on people ripping apart
their cars in the parking lot. Its also chilly up here and on top of that I
got the flu..... :(   Plus I would like a real mechanic to take a look at a
few other things on the bus. Now I need someone to take it to. The bus is a
66 split window, but I am cross posting this because I have seen quite a few
bay windows around..... Any tips on good places in the Burlington VT area
where I could get my bus looked at??

Thanks a bunch...

Tim Watson
