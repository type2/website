&gt;A larger filter should create less resistance than a small one, since it
&gt;has more filtering area.

The restriction of a fuel filter is also determined by the filtering material,
a filter which allows fewer smaller particles to pass ( measured in microns )
will restrict more larger particles than one that doesn't.
