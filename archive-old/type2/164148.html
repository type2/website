Subject: Fwd: Re: [T2] Only idles with choke fully closed

I recently went through a painful exercise with the four 34PICT-3 
carbs that I own. They are leftover from various engines that I've 
owned.

I have a 1600DP with an SVDA distributor and a Compufire  that runs 
and idles quite well and has almost no hesitation  -  if and only if 
I use the 34PICT from my son's Ghia.

If I use any of my four, all of which I've torn down, dipped, and 
rebuilt, the engine runs worse.  With #1 and #2, the engine won't 
idle no matter how I adjust the two screws. With #3, there is an 
unacceptable hesitation. With #4, it idles just fine, runs with good 
power, but hesitates for several seconds when I accelerate.

On the basis of this experience, I have to conclude that some of 
these carbs (three of mine) just cannot be made to work.

Jack
