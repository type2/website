Subject: Bentley

hey foks, I bought a new bentley about a year ago (official service manual 
for 68-79 bus).... I have since purchased a 79 westy with automatic 
transmission.  The Bentley section on the auto tranny says it only covers 
the auto tranny up to '76 and that there is not enough technical data for 
the later transmission.

Do new bentleys have a section that covers the later transmission?  If not, 
is there another source for service and technical info for a 79 auto 
tranny?  I think my tranny works ok, but just want to make sure I'm covered 
in the event something goes wrong.  Thanks, greg
