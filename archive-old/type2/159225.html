Hi All -

Mark's answer to George is well advised.  A recent thread on the 240z list was 
adamant about _not_ using the Bon Ami technique for ring seating if you valued 
your engine.

Wasn't  there some procedure involving Bon Ami polishing compound for
seating  difficult rings?

For the valve guides, could valve guide seals be  added?

Or, would it be better to just make a big oil seperator and  leave
everything well-lubed?

George

hey george   The bon ami or clorox  is a last gasp  thing.   valve seals
might help. seperator would do wonders, what do  they cost?  later mark D
