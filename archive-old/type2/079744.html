Subject: new or used case

More engine planning.

I had fully convinced myself that I should use a new Mexican case in 
the impending motor build. My main concerns about going with a used 
case are oil pressure problems and failure due to prior overheating 
of the case.  I have talked to several motor builders that still feel 
comfortable reusing later model universal cases that have been 
carefully checked for cracks, warpage or damage. Most approve of 
boring the case. One of the builders rebuilt the B case in one of my 
motors 12 years ago and it has held up well.

The only potential drawback that was mentioned about the Mexican 
cases was the plastic cam plug.

Now I am wondering......I want to spend my money right the first time :)

Thanks
Chris
