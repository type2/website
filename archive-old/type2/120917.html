Subject: Re: [T2] Tires (again)

I am running (on my '72 westy) the Michilin Agilis and am very happy 
with them so far. I only have about 8k on them but so far so good. Hope 
this helps! - Jeff

&gt; I hate to start this thread again, but I looked on the type2 library and found
&gt; some good info on tires, but most of these tires are discontinued. What is
&gt; everyone running on their busses now and how do they like them? The Yoko 370
&gt; LT's seemed to be the best, but not available anymore.
