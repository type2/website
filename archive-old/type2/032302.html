Subject: Re: [T2] 75 westy interior question
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.SOL.4.20.0105041057280.20510-100000_at_csa.bu_dot_edu&gt;


I had a '75 and now I have a '74 in its place . The '75 was a hardtop
camper which the
PO said was 'converted' to the camper interior but I think it was
original. My '74 is a stock westy. 

The differences, and these vary from bus to bus:

 The '75 had the &quot;L&quot; part of the couch with a neat little cubby under the
seat. The table in the '75 was on a swivel leg that attaced to the
bottom of the sink's cabinet. The '74 has the fold out table in the same
place, but no Seat.

From what I can tell, The Fridge/Stove units are identical aside from the 
switches.

The sinks are the same, I think. My '75 had a city water hookup that the
'74 didn't have (does now ;) ) but I think it was just an exluded option
on mine. 

Also the '75 had the westfalia control panel on the front of the closet
that controlled the city power, refridgeerator power, and 2nd battery
status. It also had a timer that charged the battery off city power.
My '74 doesn't have that, but again I'm not sure thats true of all '74
westys. I have the closet with the control panel, hopefully i can rewire
the fridge and 2nd battery to use it on my '74.


The position of the vent, and city power hookup changed as well.
I've also seen '75 orange westies with the yellow/orange plaid
interior. My '74 is (was) orange and has orange/orange plaid, which is
hard to find. Can anyone help on that, what year the colour switched?

Hope this helps.
