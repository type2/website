Subject: Re: [T2] Engine won't idle after top end rebuild - need help

I completely agree with Scott. One of the worst things you can do to a
camshaft is to install new lifters on an old cam. Same goes for new
pushrods on old rocker arms / lifters. I can vouch for this personally.
When I was very green about cars (only a few years ago), I had purchased
a 1984 Pontiac Fiero 2m4 SE as a second car. The motor didn't run right.
Turned out that it was a chipped valve. (This was the 2.5 liter Iron
Duke). I removed the head, had a valve job performed on it at a machine
shop, and re-installed it. It ran great. I thought however.. hey.. maybe
I can make it run even better. So... I purchased a brand new set of
Federal Mogul lifters for my car (flat tappet hydraulic). I installed
them. Within a month, my car developed major hesitation. I'm sad to say
that the cause of the poor performance is because AS the lifters were
wearing into the motor.... so was the cam. I basically wore down ALL of
my cam lobes. The car is unbelievably slow now.
