Subject: Re: [T2] Windshield

A minor disagreement, here:

&gt; &gt;Also, when my windshield was replaced I was told
&gt; there was a lot of rust in
&gt; &gt;the body.  I hear this is common.  Anyway, rain is
&gt; starting to come into the
&gt; &gt;cab area and some rust is visible from under the
&gt; seal.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;At one of the on-line parts under I saw an &quot;inner
&gt; rust repair panel (pair)&quot;
&gt; &gt;under a body-parts/windshield category.  What is
&gt; this for?
&gt; 
&gt; Not for what you need unfotuately, well you may need
&gt; it by now but it
&gt; won't help the major problem.  That bit repairs the
&gt; vertical lip the rubber
&gt; seals over, which may in spots be rusted clean
&gt; through but the rust you
&gt; see and is causing difficulty is on the horizontal
&gt; surface.  It is common
&gt; it is a pain.  2 choices, find a clean one cut it
&gt; out and weld it in.  

This is the only good choice. Schofield in the UK
offers a repair panel for this area, or you may be
able to source one through Busted Bus, though I don't
know if they'll source used body panels. Yes, it's
harder to do and somewhat more costly, but your end
result will last longer and be stronger. 

&gt; The
&gt; real thing to do if the bus was a keeper but frankly
&gt; no bay window with
&gt; rust bad enough under the windshield to flow in
&gt; water is worth keeping

This is so untrue. I've seen huge numbers of bays with
rust only in this area, which are very worth saving.
This previous comment sounds to me like something I'd
hear from a splitty snob. 

&gt; so face reality and choice number 2.  Bondo.

Please don't do this to your prized bus. Bondo has its
uses, but this isn't one of them. Go for the steel
fix, it's worth the effort.
