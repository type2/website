&lt;&lt; O.K. guys, since you have been so suportive in the last years I decided to

lift the bus and cheked the # part of my konis, the # is 80 2110 and I found

a site that listed them for VW transportes 72-79 starting from chassis

numbers. 22.000.097.

If you can find and afford them they worht every penny.
