Subject: Re: What are &quot;Deadhead stickers&quot;?

I tried this once already but I think it didn't send.  If it did, ignore 
this.  If not, here's my $.02:

When I think of Deadheads, I think of people who are Grateful Dead fans, 
and I am surprised other people don't.  I will put my Deadhead stickers 
on my bus when the bodywork is done.  This has nothing to do with the 
condition of my bus and everything to do with my musical preferences.  
They will go nicely with my environmental stickers.

70 Westy &quot;Cassidy&quot; (another Grateful Dead reference)
