I brought my 79 CA FI bus to a mechanic to have him bring it up to tune up
specs - especially the FI.
He found some vacuum leaks and a few other things and spent about two hours.
The bus starts and idles, but usually requires that I step on the gas
immediately upon start or prior to starting. Once I have stepped on the gas
the the bus will idle around 800 to 1000 rpms but seems to drop and rise.
Once I run the bus down the street and then stop, it idles at about
1000-1200.
When I start the bus after running into a store (the bus is warm) 75% of the
time it will start right up and idle at 800 to 1000 rpms, again hitting the
gas or driving and then stopping will result in an idle of 1000-1200. The
other 25% of the time the bus will stall after initial start up either while
backing up or at the next stop. Increased driving time usually leads to a
regular idle at 1000-1200.

Finally, I posted a week or so ago about my first trip and oil temp. At that
time several people said my temps sounded too high. Given the above
description any ideas why the bus may be running too hot --- around 250
going 60-65 on flat, and climbing small hills in third and fourth between 50
- 60 mph. The engine is brand new with aprox.1300 miles on it?? Valves,
timing and above mentioned fuel injection tune ups have been done. Bus has
lots of power and feels downright peppy!!
