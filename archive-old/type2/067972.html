Subject: VW escape buses [was: VW on Star Trek Voyager] 

There's also the Richard Dreyfus movie of a few years ago: Moon over
Parador.  Set on a mythical Carribean island republic, and all the
emergency vehicles are buses.  Before I got my bus, all I remembered from
this film were the Sonja Braga scenes; now I notice buses.  Only on this
list would this be considered progress.
