Subject: RE: [T2] crankcase breather questions

Dont think there is one in the hose. When the engine is runnig there is 
Vacuum at the hose that connects the breather to the intake boot. The vacuum 
is at the throttle body. There is no vacuum at the breather box until vacuum 
is applied via the hose to the intake boot. So there really is no need for a 
valve.You could however leak oil there it is a possibility at the gasket 
underneath. If you can blow on both ends then you know that there is no 
clogg in the hose...that's a good thing.

The oil sender can leak from the connections for the wires as well as the 
threads but try the teflon tape.

&gt;From: &quot;David White&quot; So the question is: is this crankcase breather equipped 
&gt;with a one way valve?
&gt;It
&gt;connects a hole in the near center of the block back to the fuel intake 
&gt;system
&gt;after the air flow meter stuff and before the intake manifold, so common 
&gt;sense
&gt;would tell me that there should
&gt;be a valve so that air can exit the crankcase and enter the air flow, but
&gt;that air coming through the air flow meter (destined for combustion) would
&gt;not be able to enter the crank case. However some people say I lack common
&gt;sense. Incidentally I can blow on both ends of the breather to force air
&gt;through it.
