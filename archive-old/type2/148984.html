&gt; A couple of years ago I saw a &quot;McGovern for president&quot; bumper sticker on
&gt; eBay - I almost bought it for my bus (I was minus three years old during
&gt; that
&gt; election)   :-)

   Just a bumper sticker...?-) I've still got my &quot;McGovern for president&quot;
kerchief...A &quot;gift&quot; for stuffing hundreds of envelopes... ;-)
