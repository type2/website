Subject: '78 Westy axle troubles
Mime-Version: 1.0

I noticed something the other night while fighting with my Westy lower
shock bolts. 

My rear axle has about 1/8&quot; of in/out play. I mean to say that the stub
axle will slide in and out of the bearing/trailing arm. I have no way to
check the tightness of the axle nut but in the 2 years (and 15K mi) that I
have driven this Westy, the cotterpins have not bent or otherwise been
mangled. Time to travel down the street to the local friendly mechanic for
a twist of the mighty wrench? 

Is this a sign my bearings are worn out, that the axle nut needs to be
torqued tighter, or a sign that the bearings have worn a groove on the stub
axle and one or the other needs to be replaced? I am due to pack the bearings. 

My bus has either 84K miles or 184K miles. The steering is awful tight for
184K miles. Most of the wear that this bus shows seems to just be age, not
mileage. 

Thanks to all that might try to help....
