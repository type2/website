Subject: Re: [T2] VDO Oil Pressure sender

While I doubt it will hurt anything I don't think it will work. when I
got a oil pressure sender I got the one that had the connection for
both the idiot light &amp; the gauge. I believe (but can't confirm it
right now) that the idiot light control is simply a on/off switch set
to toggle when the oil pressure is too low to push the internal
spring. But the oil gauge sender is a variable transmitter so you can
see just how high (or low) your pressure is.

&gt; My gauges and senders came in today. The oil pressure sender only has 
&gt; one terminal on it and I though it would have two:one for the VDO 
&gt; gauge and one for the stock idiot light. Can I hook both up to the 
&gt; same terminal or will that mess everything up?
