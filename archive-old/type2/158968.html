Subject: Re: [T2] Hydraulic lifters and Webcam 107i

Thanks, I was looking for the voice of experience. So... the hydraulics 
are behaving like pseudo-solids.  I'll back 'em off again and 
experiment, as you say.  Thanks again.

I have used this same motor set up in the past.

It is not mandatory to use 1 1/2 turns of preload.  Why not try zero 
lash  + 1/4 turn?  I have done such minor things, and had full lift AND 
quiet lifters.  Experiment.

You have already discovered your issue..............the preload of 1 1/2
turns is not letting everything open and close properly.  It may work 
fine on a worn out motor, but on a new one, everything is still fresh. 
Back off on the preload and all will be well.

Plus, remember you are experimenting with a new FI 
system.............you can bring the idle up by adding advance because 
you have a vacuum leak with the valves not closing all the way  :)
