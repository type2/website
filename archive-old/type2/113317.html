Subject: Auxiliary batteries

My coach battery is dead. Completely. Old and tired.

I was thinking about replacing it with a deepcycle battery that would let
me run some health equipment while camping ALL NIGHT long....

Is there a problem with car alternators overcharging deepcycle batteries
when on the road?

Anybody do this now?

Thanks,
