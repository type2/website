Subject: rotating seat

I have a set of later model seats in my 78.  I'm told they came from a
Honda Accord.  They appear to bolt right into the orignal mounting holes.
Does anyone have experience retrofitting new(er) seats with the orginal
swivel from the stock set-up?  I'd like to be able to rotate the seat.  I
have the original seats and (most) hardware, as well.

Regards,

Todd Orchard
