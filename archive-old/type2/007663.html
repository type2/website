Subject: '78 Winnebego Conversion?
Date: Tue, 10 Nov 1998 09:27:45 PST

I am considering bying a '78 2.0 litre bus. The owner says it was 
converted to a camper (with pop-top) by Winnebego. Is this true? He says 
that they don't want to admit to it though. It was done pretty ugly with 
a brown interior and ugly wood grain cabinets. The cabinets handles are 
metal with designs like something old-fashioned, I've never seen handles 
like this on a VW. Behind the front passenger seat, next to the sliding 
door is empty accept for  two little hook-ups (owner says are for 
propane tank under-neath sliding door to where the stove would be) There 
is also another electrical outlet there with the hook-ups. The owner 
says that in this empty space there used to be a stove and Ice box. Is 
this true, if so how was it set up? The sink ans closet are behind the 
driver's seat. The back of the rear bench is split in half so you can 
fold half of the bed out if you want to. Also 
The pop-top is a plastic kind of material, not the usual Westy material. 
It has a flap that when the pop-top is down folds over and snaps on to 
prevent air fron getting in. I am considering this bus and would 
appreciate any ideas, warnings tips, or advice on this conversion and 
how I could fix it up. I want to cover the ugly wood grain, re-upholster 
the bed, put in a new carpet and put in a stove and ice box. I would 
like to (but I think it would be to difficult)paint the inside, it is an 
ugly brown. Any comments welcome. Thanks.
        Simon
