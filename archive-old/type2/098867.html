Subject: George's rear brake saga (long)

George's Rear Brake Saga.

This story concerns a '71 baywindow, but it applicable to the early bay
and splitty folks as well.  Except for the composite drums, the principles
are the same.

Having had odd tire wear (scalloped on inside edge, only half of the
circumference) on my right rear tire, and noticing a bit of a pulse while
braking, I suspected that the drum on that wheel might be out of round.  I
pulled the drum off (a cinch on a '71-up bus as it has composite drums)
and eyeballed it.

Now, I don't have a drum caliper, but this drum was so worn that I could
tell that it was beyond the wear limit with a tape measure!  Replacing the
drums was a no-brainer.  I called the local VWFLAPS and surprisingly, they
had a set of drums in stock!  I went down and picked up the new drums.
They were in a blue ATE box, but with no indication of where they were
manufactured.  The box label was in German, but the text on the box was a
polyglot combination of English, Italian, Portuguese, Arabic, Russian,
Greek, and Chinese.  In any case, the drums looked good, so I bought them.

Once home, I decided that it would be nice to paint the bare metal so that
it would look good for a while.  The only black paint on the shelf was
high temp barbeque paint which seemed appropriate for brake drums so I
applied a couple of coats.  I masked off the area where the wheel touches
the drum and of course no paint was applied to the inside of the drum.

The shoes looked good (big mistake there!) and there was no apparent
leakage from the cylinders, so I retracted the adjusters and did a trial
fit of the drums.  They slipped over the shoes, but the center hole
refused to slip over the hub to allow the drum to seat against the hub.
Seems that this is a very tight fit to locate the drum on the hub, so I
had to work for a while with 200 grit sandpaper to remove the rust that
was blocking things.  Once the hub was shiny, the drums slipped right on.

I adjusted the shoes as I usually do, tightening the adjusters until the
shoes drag heavily and then backing them off until only a slight drag
remained.  All was good, or so I thought.

A couple of days later I loaded the family up and headed up US 395 for
Nevada.  After 45 miles, we stopped in Rosamond for breakfast.  While
walking around the bus, I noted an odd smell, like that of hot paint.  I
have an infrared thermometer and pointed it at the drum through the rim
holes.  400 F!!!  Gad!  I must have left the adjustment too tight!  I
grabbed a screwdriver, crawled under, and loosened the stars a couple of
notches.  We went into the restaurant (The Skillet) for an excellent
breakfast while the brakes cooled.

Bellies full, we hit the road again and stopped 15 miles later in Mojave
to check the brakes.  They were still toasty warm at 280 F.  Back under
the bus, click click click click.

15 miles further, out comes the thermometer again.  350 F.  Dangit, I must
have been turning the adjusters the wrong way!  I get out the flashlight
and loosen things a lot, making sure that there is a visible gap between
the shoe and drum with a flashlight.

Back on the road again, I know that I loosened things up, since the pedal
now goes down a lot further that it normally does.  Another 10 miles and
the drums are now cooled to 100 F, so things are OK for the time being.

Reusing old shoes with new drums was not a bright thing to do.  The shoes
were worn to match a diameter larger than that of the new drums, so when
they dragged slightly they self-energized into the drums and heated them
up much more than if I had used new shoes.  New shoes have a slightly
smaller diameter than even a new drum, so they will touch the drum in only
one spot and self-energize correctly.  Live and learn.

Anyway, the remaining 300 miles to Nevada went without incident.
Beautiful driving weather, and snow on the ground in Carson City to
delight my children and discourage me from crawling under the bus.  A week
and two storms pass.  Finally, the weather clears and it's time to head
for home.  Another 400 miles, which thankfully didn't involve much braking
since the towns US 395 passes through have little need for traffic lights.
As I.m driving near home, I note that the right rear brake is now grabby,
causing that corner of the bus to dip whenever I apply the brakes.  Ah,
well, I'm now near home and have time to work on it!

The next day I wake to warm (75 degree) temperatures characteristic of the
Santa Ana winds.  A perfect day to work on the bus!  Up on the stands and
off come the wheels and the cause of the grabby brake becomes apparent.
The right wheel cylinder had developed a definite leak, probably from the
high temperatures it experienced the week before or the increased piston
motion after I loosened the adjustment.  Brake fluid was on the shoe and
drum.  Time to bite the bullet and do the job right.

A call to the VWFLAPS yields the needed cylinders and shoes, along with
the little horseshoe clips for the emergency brake levers and a quart of
brake fluid.  I zapped the cylinder bolt and brake line fittings with
Liquid Wrench while giving them taps with a hammer and punch to ward off
the Rust Gods.  I made the parts run and prepare to take things apart.

First step is to top off the brake fluid reservoir.  No way do I want air
to get into the master cylinder!  Next, I loosen the emergency brake
adjustments all the way.

Back at the left rear wheel, I pull off the retaining springs and the
lower retraction spring on the brake shoes.  The upper retraction spring
cannot be detached with the shoes in place.  I pulled the lower end of the
shoes out of their adjusters and the top end of the shoes out of the
cylinder.  The upper retraction spring keeps the shoes together and by
rotating the shoe assembly opposite the direction of forward wheel
rotation I disengaged the emergency brake lever from its cable.

Once the shoes are off, I clean up the backing plate.  The adjusters come
out, get cleaned with carb cleaner, and recoated with anti-seize.  They
are reinstalled in their fully-retracted position.  By now, the
penetrating oil has (hopefully) done its magic, so an 11mm flare nut
wrench is applied to the brake fitting.  It breaks loose nicely.
Heartened, I try a 13mm socket with an extension through the divot in the
hub on the cylinder bolt.  Amazingly, it loosens nicely too!  My luck is
holding!  I remove the cylinder bolt entirely and then back out the brake
line connection which frees the cylinder completely.  It was a Brasilian
Varga that was on the bus when I bought it a decade ago.

I noted that the brake line was dripping merrily at a rate of about three
drops a second.  I quickly stuck an old cake pan under the backing plate
to catch the drips.  I checked the reservoir and indeed it was dropping,
so apparently the fluid was flowing through the line.  This is good, since
if fluid is moving toward the open end of the line, the line won.t fill
with air!  I topped the reservoir again, cleaned the backing plate and
installed the new cylinder (also Brasilian Varga).  It is easier to get
the brake line threads started if you do it before bolting the cylinder to
the backing plate.  Screw the brake line fitting in finger tight, put a
dab of anti-seize on the cylinder attach bolt and tighten it down, and
then finally tighten the brake line fitting snugly.  Experimentally, I
opened the bleeder screw, and soon fluid dripped freely from that opening
after filling the cylinder.  I tightened the bleeder screw and hoped that
that brake was bled.  It seemed likely, as the brake line turns up before
the cylinder so there was no way that air could have made its way into the
system with fluid flowing out.

At this point, the goal is to get the new shoes in place without getting
brake fluid (or anything else) on the friction surfaces.  Off come the old
gloves and on go a new pair.  I laid out the old shoes and replaced the
springs and emergency brake mechanism one part at a time on the new shoes
so that I could keep track of the puzzle.  The horseshoe clips that hold
the emergency brake lever pivot pins are one-use parts that have to be
bent apart and then replaced with new.  I put a dab of anti-seize on the
pivot.  Once together, the shoe assembly is replaced on the backing plate
by reversing the removal process.  The emergency brake cable is hooked on
its lever, and then the shoes are swung around the hubs in the same
direction as forward wheel rotation.  Once the shoes are basically in
place, their upper ends are carefully placed through the slots in the dust
boots into the wheel cylinder.  The lower ends are placed in the
adjusters.  The lower retraction spring is reattached, and the two shoe
retention springs are replaced on their pins.

Since one of the drums was contaminated with brake fluid, they both get a
careful cleaning with isopropyl alcohol.  Quite a few paper towels are
consumed until finally they remain white while rubbing the drum.  Even
though only one drum was contaminated, the &quot;do the same thing to both
sides&quot; rule still applies.  More cleaning, rubbing, etc. on the other
drum.

The right brake comes apart and goes together as nicely as the left brake.
I won't bore you with the details.  Again, the fluid dripped freely and
seemed to bleed the cylinder all by itself.  I'm keeping my fingers
crossed!

So far, I've spent about four leisurely hours on the brakes and it is
getting dark, so adjusting is left for the morrow.

The dawn reveals another beautiful day in SoCal.  I was leery of the
adjusting, since the last attempt was such a disaster.  I shouldn't have
worried though, as the new shoes made it a snap.  A very definite boundary
between rubbing and not rubbing.  I tightened the adjusters until it
rubbed, then backed off until it turned freely, then two additional clicks
loose (and I made sure that I was going in the right direction this time!)

Emergency brake adjustment was next.  The '71 has individual cable
adjustments inside the bus at the base of the lever.  Pull the lever out
four clicks.  Tighten the left adjuster nut until the wheel is just barely
turnable by hand.  Tighten the lock nut.  Repeat for the right adjuster.

Finally, the moment of truth.  Did the system really self-bleed as I
thought?  I lowered the bus from the stands, released the emergency brake
and tentatively pushed on the brake pedal.  Amazingly, the pedal was firm
and high!  I was done without having to go through the bleeding ritual!

Now, I will say that I was prepared to bleed the system.  One of the
advantages of being a physics teacher is access to cool stuff like vacuum
pumps and laboratory glassware.  I had made a brake bleeder jar from a
250ml Erlenmeyer flask, a two-hole stopper, and two pieces of glass
tubing.  I would have connected one of these tubes to the brake bleeder
and the other to the vacuum pump.  I expected it to work very effectively,
since the source of vacuum was strong and continuous, but I never got the
chance to try it out!  :)

I took a 10 mile drive across town to take the family to dinner and to
listen to a bluegrass band, and checked the drum temperature on both ends
of the trip.  Temps in the 130-150 range with good balance between sides.
No pulling or pulsing at all.  After another hundred miles or so I'll
readjust the brakes as they wear in.

There's the saga of the rear brake rebuild.  Learn from my mistakes!
Never combine old shoes and new drums, and pay attention to that little
voice that says &quot;do it right the first time!&quot;  Give penetrating oil time
to do its work and put anti-seize on those bolts that you will want to
remove later.  Most importantly, never do a major repair right before
taking a long trip!
