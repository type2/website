Subject: [T2] Help I have no Brake lights!

Subject vehicle is a 68 Double Cab. I have power through the fuse and to the
brake light switches on the master cylinder and as I hook the wires together
there I don't get any power to the brake lights at the back of the bus. I
have running lights only in the back. In front I have running and both turn
signals. As I look at the wiring diagram it looks like the brake wires go
through the horn or turn signal assembly. I recently replaced my steering
box and after that my horn didn't work. I thought that I put the horn wire
back on just where it came off but maybe not.
Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated as this is my daily driver and
I'm stuck until I can fix it. I hate electrical work ( I can't see
electricity) so am not very good at it.
Thanks,
Britt
