Hello,
I'm new here.......

My name is Jake Raby, I own and operate Raby's Aircooled Technology, a
strictly aircooled engine shop, located in Cleveland Georgia.

We specialize in all types of aircooled engines, from vintage, to
performance, all for street and daily driver applocations. We see alot of
bus engines, and love type 4 engines with a passion.

It is not my goal to slam this list with advertisement for my business, you
will never see that...I travel to forums and lists all over the net, trying
to keep those from making the same mistakes I made, years ago, while
learning these engines the hard and only way..I have no formal education in
aircooled engines, but have hours of mistakes from the university of
experience..

I'm here to aid in any engine question, or just to shed some light on some
theories and ideas from time to time....

It is nice to be a member of another list of friends, nice to electronically
meet each of you. Now go see my site, if you have not been there before, it
is still in the works, but is almost finished..
Sincerely,
Jake Raby

&gt;
&gt; &gt;I also need to plug up the EGR port on this exhaust system.  Any
suggestions?
&gt;
&gt; The muffler EGR port can be brazed shut, and drilled out later for the
original function.
