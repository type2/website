Subject: spare tire where it belongs! : )

&gt;I finally popped the money and got a spare tire front-mount
&gt;bracket and a white vinyl cover and put it on today, and although at first
&gt;it looked alarmingly Bozo-the-Clown-ish or Suffocating-Mime-ish [blue bus,
&gt;white top], I've decided it looks good.

Bill:

Good place for it!  Mine already had one, saving me the time of putting one on.
I'm a firm believer in having a tire between one and an accident.  Five
years ago
I totalled a Thing (newly COMPLETELY restored) with TWO tires mounted on 
the front.  The first was mounted vertically on the front, and the other was on
top of the hood.  When the little girl out learning to drive pulled out two
car lengths
ahead of me on a state highway (45mph), the front spare hit the rear axle of the
truck she was driving and blew.  The front of the Thing crumpled back to the
front 
edge of the tire on the hood, which absorbed the remaining energy of the crash.
I luv spare tires--wish I could put about a dozen around the bus, but that'd
probably be illegal......

....be on the road in no time.
