Subject: Pushrods hydraulic lifters with solid rods

I was hoping someone could help me out here. I'm in the midst of a rebuild
on my 79 Series GE 2.0 and encountered an odd problem. The lifters are
hydraulic but the rods that I pulled out were the hollow type used for solid
lifters. The engine ran fine with this setup, but was leaking quite a bit of
oil, plus I got a tranny issue so I decided to rebuild.

Anyone have suggestions? Can I rebuild with the hollow pushrods? If not...
anyone got a line on a set of used solid rods that I can use instead?
