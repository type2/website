Well, no, I did not remove the compressor. I frequently entertain fantasies
about rebuilding it myself, and resurrecting the system. Also, its presence
in some strange way comforts my wife, whose blind faith in my mechanical
skills in turn comforts me. So, I need the piece that goes around the
outside of the compressor between it and the body opening for the engine. If
you happen to know of anyone who has a source for this piece I would be
grateful.

Thank you for your persistence,

Tom and Dana Cates
