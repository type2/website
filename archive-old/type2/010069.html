Hello!

	On July 23rd, two of my friends and I will be taking my 1974 VW
Bus, which I just finished rebuilding, on a trip through the British
Columbia, the Yukon, and into Alaska.  We plan to spend a month or so in
the area before returning, and want to see everything we can!

	I'm writing because I wanted to see if there was anyone that lived
along the way that would want to get together, camp/cookout, etc.  I'm
leaving from the Chicagoland area, going to Boulder CO to pick up one of
the fellow travelers, and then we are shooting north/northwest up to
Alaska.

	Additionally, I wanted to know if anyone has taken a similar trip
that would like to share any stories with me, places to go, things to do
or not to do, etc.

	I'm really excited, so if anyone has any thoughts just let me
know!  Thanks!

	I hope everyone had a great fourth of July!!

	   Wade
	   Newly rebuilt 1974 Bus!
