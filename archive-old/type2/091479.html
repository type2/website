Subject: Re: [T2] VW Trademarks/resale

what about resale? there are alot of products that are resold over and
over and the original creators never see another penny... just ask that
country singer who refused to sell his albums at outlets that also sold
used copies. if he wasnt going to make money off the album being resold,
then he wasnt going to support them. this was almost 10 years ago, BTW.

VWoA can't restrict the resale of original parts, and it doesnt make
sense that they could restrict the advertisement of their availability.
they are no longer property of VW... if they could, then Ebay wouldnt be
in business for long.

waving sadly cuz no matter what they do, i still love these cars,

Get

... WRONG!! Or at least wrong in the respect that VWoA does NOT support 
these
&gt; vehicles. Call your local VW dealer and ask them if they carry any 
air-cooled
&gt; parts, ...  
&gt;HOWEVER, if they are  going to FORBID others to provide us with this
stuff, then THEY MUST. And  they are not
&gt; providing us with the parts and merchandise we need or want. THIS is 
the problem...
&gt; Screw their logo, I don't care if I can't get a Pint Glass
&gt; with the VW on it, but when I need a carburetor or brakes or fuel 
tank, then
&gt; dammit I want to know that their is SOMEONE out there who can  provide
it for
&gt; me, and right now, VWoA CANNOT.
