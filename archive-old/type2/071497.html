&lt;&lt; Should I tune the webber, swap for the duals, or try to sale/trade the 74 
which runs and is almost complete(no it does not have a stool) for a set of 
dual webber 44's. &gt;&gt;

or how about D), NONE of the above!!  you should really consider fuel 
injection.

After personally owning buses with stock single solex, stock duel solex and 
aftermarket duel weber ICT, and IDF systems,  I personally would choose 
either the stock bus L-jetronic FI or a conversion to K-jetronic (CIS) FI ANY 
day over carbs.

My current bus with a stock 1800cc engine has a K-jet fuel injection 
conversion with components from a late 70's rabbit/jetta.  It outperforms any 
carb system I have ever had.  More power, evenly distributed throughout the 
rpm band, no linkage adjustments or balancing, imediate cold starts in below 
freezing weather, its much quieter and the fuel distributor constantly 
adjusts fuel delivery for demand, altitude, temperature etc.  NO electronics, 
its all mechanical.  It passed the 79 model year emmission tests with flying 
colors.
