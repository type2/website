Subject: Re: [T2] Fwd: mystery machine

I'll tell you guys exactly what that Van is--and it ain't no mystery--
It's a 63-64 Chevy--
Look at the grill, and the doors--it's a dead give away--

Had several of them--pretty good old trucks-

In the dead of winter you could work on the engine-just flip up the
engine cover, and work away inside the Van--:&gt;)

 
mystery machine 
http://www.angelfire_dot_com/tv2/mysterymachine/
http://www.toys-and-merchandise_dot_com/scooby_doo_mystery_machine.php Looks
more like a dodge to me. 
Maybe I should start a side business making bumper stickers for VW's 
that say: Its not the Mystery Machine! 
Suzuki Samauri owners are known for putting stickers on thier that say
&quot;Its not a Jeep!&quot;
