Subject: 1600 in '61?

I'm going to attempt to put a 1600 from a '72 bus (last of the '71
motors, I'm told) into my '61 Kombi. Any switchover troubles? The '61
last had a '65  1300 in it, that blew. I know nothing about the 12/6
volt standing of the bus... Will everything bolt up? The '71 motor has
some mods on it - weird air cleaner and large carb. 

Do I need to save any parts off of the '61 motor? Exhaust, shroud,
generator, anything?

I would love to hear that I can just pull it right out, and pop it right
back in into mine. It would make life easy. I've heard of some weird
mods to the housing or something with the 12=volt system...myths?

Thanks?
