Subject: [Q] Loose Rocker Arm Studs

Hi all,
        Well, I have a pair of 1700cc heads I am going to rebuild and
place on my engine (then rebuild the ones I take off:).  They got
dumped into a bucket of carb cleaner last night.  The problem is that
two of the rocker arm studs are loose, and one is missing. And one of
the exhaust port studs is loose.  What can I do about this?  

Also, the copper gaskets at the exhaust ports are STUCK.  I am hoping
that a couple days of soaking in the carb cleaner will loosen them
up.  If not, is there another way to coax them out?

Thanks all for any advice!  We are finally moved into our new house
(with a garage almost as big as the house!!!)  So looks like I'll be
starting the project of putting the disassembled engine I bought back
together!  YEAH!!!!

Take care all.

brandy
