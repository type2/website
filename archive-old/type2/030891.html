&gt; +AD4-Theres a piece of tinware that was nearly rusted through on the '77 engine
&gt; I bought. It looks like a heat shield. It apparently goes between the

yup it's a heat shield, and mine is long gone, and is frys the foam air
seal above it ;8*{

&gt; +AD4-Is this piece available new that anyone knows of? I'm scouting locally but
&gt; so far have come up dry.

sure haven't found one myself, let the list know

&gt; I just got one from Just Kampers in UK. Genuine VW NOS for 12.5 pounds, but
&gt; I don't know if this is local for you.

well I would be glad to send the 12.5 L but I don't think I can afford the
shipping.  wond if anyone in the USA has em?????
