Subject: Re: [T2] 34PICT3 adjustment

32 degrees. I measured 1 3/4 of an inch to the right of TDC and marked it with 
some white fingernail polish. My TDC mark was right on the money, I did the 
pencil thing with the #1 plug out, good thing too cause I had adjusted the 
valves a month or so ago. If this hesitation is the nature of the beast with 
the 009 I was wondering if the vacuum advance dizzy off of my 76 will work on 
this 1600 engine? I just went out to see if I could get the part# off of it but 
couldn't see it. I'll have to take another gander at it tomarrow.
