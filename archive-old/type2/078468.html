Subject: Fuel injector question

I am putting the finishing touches on a engine install and have a
question about my fuel injectors. I was replacing the seals and noticed
the plastic cover on the tip moves. The tip itself doesn't move just the
plastic collar thing. I checked my other injectors and they also do that
is this normal? I also need help on where the vacumn lines go. It's a 78
Westy all stock.
