Subject: Re: [T2] Don's CV boots -- let's get serious here

&gt; Okay, Don, here's the deal. I'll pay for the CV boots (Bus Depot, 9.95
&gt; each) if someone else will volunteer to pay for expedited shipping. (It
&gt; might even be a drop ship from a California location).
&gt;
&gt; Do you have the correct drive for the bolts? If not, I will mail you
&gt; mine today and you'll have to mail it back to me.
&gt;
&gt; Do you know whether your bolts can be reused? If not you'll need those
&gt; too. Have you got a place nearby where you can get those?

I have about half a million of those bolts and plates in my bolt bucket.
you need em I'll ship em, you do the same as for the boots and donate the
postage to the list...because I keep forgetting too.

&gt; I read the posts about how to use duct tape and baggies and whatnot,
&gt; and that's fine and I am sure it would work. But there's a principle
&gt; involved here. I'm not sure exactly what it is, but it's there.

baggies and duct tape is a side of the road get me outta here emergency
repair and if you don't do this repair before you leave you better take
the baggies and duct tape because you will be doing it somewhere on your
trip, and remember &quot;murphy&quot; it will be at the most inconvienent time most
inaccessible location.

&gt; Now, this isn't charity. You're not a tsunami victim. So the deal is
&gt; this: you have to promise to do three things:

same here
&gt;
&gt; 1. Change the CV boots before you leave for Denver
&gt;
&gt; 2. When you have the money, donate the cost of the boots to the type2
&gt; list (because I keep forgetting to do it)
&gt;
&gt; 3. Get straight about priorities. CV boots come before H4 lights
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Maybe I'm being a jerk to insist on all this. If so, you and others can
&gt; tell me.

no, just a concerned volk.

Bob
