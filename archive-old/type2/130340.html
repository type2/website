Subject: Re: [T2] Can you boil a Carb?

Hi Phil,

Bleach won't help at all. Vinegar will make the copper and brass bits 
very shiny, but AFAIK it won't do much for the zinc.

Go to a Yamaha Motorcycle dealer and talk to someone in their service 
department. Yamaha has a product made exactly for this purpose, and the 
people on the vintage motorcycle list say tht ir works wonders.


Happy trails,

&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; I have taken my dual carb solex apart (on my 72 1700cc) and given them 
&gt; a good cleaning. I have used steel wool, wire brush and solvent. The 
&gt; passages will be blown with compressed air soon. But there are some 
&gt; hard to get spots that I can't get to. So I was wondering if I could 
&gt; boil (maybe with some bleach or vinegar)the carb? Will this clean the 
&gt; carb or harm it? Has anyone tried this with any success?
