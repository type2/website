Subject: Windhield removal

Hi.

Assuming that there is a 'new' rubber  on the windshield (it really doesn't 
matter, as long as the INSIDE part of the windshield rubber is pliable!!) . 
. .

Removal:

Push out, with the bottom of your foot, at the upper left corner, inside.  
Push until you can hear it moving (old seal) or feel it moving (new seal).

Then HOLD THAT PRESSURE!!  Hold that pressure until it stops making noise 
(15-20 seconds) or until it stops moving (5-10 seconds).

Apply a tiny bit more pressure until you get noise or movement back.

When you see some light at the corner (2-3 minutes), move foot slightly (3-6 
inches) along edge, and repeat above.


This takes a bit of time to do at the beginning, but goes faster as you get 
the upper corner done.


DO NOT:

Do not pull the glass from the outside.  It will not bend like normal glass. 
  It will crack.

Do not use metal objects, like a screw driver, to get the rubber started.  
You may nick the glass, or cut the rubber.


Install:

Silicon the metal around the frame vice the rubber itself.

Use the rope trick.  Do NOT apply more that 4.4 lbs of frontal pressure from 
the outside while the second person from the inside is pulling the rope 
(heavy string).  It will simply pinch the rubber to the windshield frame, 
making it difficult to pull the rope/heavy string.  The rope/string will 
then CUT the rubber seal from the inside as it is pulled.  Kind of an 
important note here!!

Make sure the windshield is centered as you are having the rope/string 
pulled.  This is critical.  If the rubber seal is firmly attached, you can 
feel the open distances on the left and on the right of the 
windshield/rubber with your sensitive finger tips (sorry Mike B.!!) as you 
position the item.

Follow other's advice about warming the rubber seal, cleaning the areas, 
etc.

PS.  You do not have to remove the rear view mirror, or the wiper arms, but 
it would be nice to do.

And do not drink alcohol before the job is completely done.

(Why start at the upper left, and not the upper right??  Because there is a 
better chance that the driver's seat is in the VW than the passenger's seat, 
and the steering wheel is a nice place to sometimes rest the leg at the 
begining of the process.  And because Muir says so!!)

&quot;Dad, when I grow up, I want to drive a VW bus.&quot;

The father kindly replied, &quot;You can't do both son!&quot;
