Hey everybody, 
I'm so sad to see her leave, but I gotta get rid of my baby. I wanted to leave
it with someone to take care of her, and I couldn't think of a better place to
sell her than here,.... here's the specs, *sniff*
1978 VW Standard Minibus
Runs great, VERY little rust (even under body.. origionally came from CA)
New Tires
New wiper motor
New CV boots
She's Green and White and is a reall attention getter (you guys/gals should
know)
I want to leave her with someone who will take care of her..... 
Asking for $4000 obo.
She really is in god condition, has a few dents and dings but other than that
in pretty good shape.
If anyone is interested please E-mail me or call me at:

I live in Hightstown, NJ (central)
thanks again.
