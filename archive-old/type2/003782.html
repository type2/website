When it comes to tooling up on a budget, let's not forget yard sales and =
farm auctions. I can't count how many times I have bought boxes full of =
tools for a few dollars. I sort them into good/okay/crap and use them =
accordingly. Over the years I have built up a collection of mostly very =
good tools. And nothing beats having a pile of crap tools around to =
bend/grind/cut into something for the job at hand.

It has been my experience that successful mechanic-ing is 90% in the =
mechanic and 10% in the tools. Top-end tools feel nice in the hand and =
look pretty in the box, but they do not in any way guarantee top-end =
results for the amateur or the professional. When I was just starting to =
collect tools, I found that having a wide variety of lesser quality =
tools was better than having only a few of higher quality.

just my $02.
