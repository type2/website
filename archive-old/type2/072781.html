Subject: Wheel Bearings?

List-
(72 Westy) When I accelerate while turning left I hear a knocking or
clacking sound from the rear end. This only happens when turning left with
my foot on the gas. I figured it was some sort of play due to worn wheel
bearings and it's getting worse.  What do you think?
Also: someone mentioned some shortcuts to the procedure in Bently for
removing rear wheel bearings. Where can I find this information?
Since it's Friday, does anyone know H*nda A**ords (87) as well as Busses?
Let me know, I have some questions.
Thank you,
John Ingram
