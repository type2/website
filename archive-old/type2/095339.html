Subject: Re: [T2] Interiors for a 78 Westy - Newbie's only - long


&gt;Barry..
How do you
&gt;come by all these parts?  Sounds like you just walk out the door and find a
&gt;new wheel, camper top or something...I hope I have that luck.

Andy, I discovered the therapeutic value of junk yard hunting.

Where else could you spend 8 hours of destructive discovery, and wind up 
with an armful of parts and pieces and only spent $20??

Its a great release.

If there is a junk yard in my path, I will stop in and ask if they have any 
old buses.  If not, I ask if they know of any yards that might have an old 
VW bus.

There is Penny's in Woodbridge VA. Just 10 miles from me.  The front of the 
yard is just 150 yards wide, but they have a sign that says 'if we don't 
have it, we can get it' or something like that.  It is so small you have to 
turn around to get to it.

I stopped in and asked.  Yes, they had 6-8 buses in back!!  (many are now 
gone).  I went in on '78 hardtop camper that seemed pretty decent. After a 
short time, I noticed a 'ticking'.  The clock was working!!!  The battery 
had not even been taken out of the VW!!!

I got the clock (still have it) and also some papers in the VW that helped 
me track down the PO.  He was in Maryland, and we had a nice visit. (I had 
to go to his house, and I met his invalid mother and car-nut father - Dad 
was in the garage with his '57 Chevy convertible, watching TV and drinking 
beer.  The garage was carpeted and paneled, and along the walls were dozens 
of miniature early Chevy models.  Both mom and dad loved this '57 
convertible and went to Carlyle PA each year for their show.)

I got  a set of -4- new ball joints from this PO youngster, and still have 
them in my stash.

This was one of my earlier exposure to junk yards.  Probably 6 years ago.

Over a period of time, I was re-doing the interior panels in my '78.  
Stripping the wood with acetone, and re-staining it and varnishing it.
I was in search of the solid wood panels that come off the '77, to replace 
the paper covered panels that were stock on my '78.

Look forever, I could NOT find a decent wood panel from a sliding door (to 
refinish).  I remembered the '78 hardtop camper, which I had gotten some 
other things from, and went back to see it, this is about 3 years later.

The '78 was still there, it had the wood panel panel I was looking for.  It 
was not as nice as I would have hoped for, but I took it just the same.  
After I stripped it down and refinished it, I was really happy with the 
results.  This completed my interior project.  Happy days.

Again, very early in my junk yard hunting, I came across Epperson in 
Thornburg VA, south of Fredericksburg.

On my first visit, I saw that they had a super nice early bus with excellent 
exterior and a chrome VW insignia on the front. It was full of hardware and 
heavy metal pieces, and I was afraid to go near it.  It was in a special 
place in the yard, near the front, and no other vehicles around.

I went back into the weeds and found a super nice late bay that looked like 
it hit a tree on the passenger side.  You know what I mean.  I got a few 
pieces off it, but the prices were a tad higher than I wanted to pay. (Being 
a bus, it had the right side rear (middle window, actually) vent window that 
is so precious.)  I went back next week for some more parts (and as a way of 
establishing some rapport, I brought the counter man a VHS tape, Rocky 
Horror Picture Show!!).

On my way out, I asked about the pristine early bay.  He said that it was 
crushed!!

Crushed!?!?  Yes, the heavy metal stuff I saw inside was there to add 
weight, and it was on it's way to the crusher when I saw it.  Heck, they 
probably only got $50 for the metal, and I missed it by not asking about it.

And the cherry late bay bus (with a full set of white vinyl seats, motor 
untouched, perfect paint, etc...) also went to the crusher just a few months 
later.  When I asked them WHY??, they said I was the only one interested in 
it, and I was not picking enough parts off it to keep it in the yard.

Besides these yards, there is a series of Banks in our area, and some others 
worth mentioning, like the one past the KOA campgrounds on route 607, Guinea 
Station Road.  The story there is a few split buses (2 or 3) and run by mom 
&amp; sons.  Dad got blown away with a shotgun by one of the sons, so it is just 
mom and sons now.  Mom sells mostly the big iron USA machines to the 
demolution derby crowd.  She save up any special machines for them, and the 
drivers come from all around -200 miles- with trailers. Fun to watch.  The 
boys are playing with motorcycles in the back, and the dogs are just 
sniffing you until the yard closes.

The Brandiwine chain is here, also, and they might keep a VW bus a few long 
months, or just hours. Like in Vietnam, you HAVE to take what you think you 
might need in the future, because the supply item could disappear right 
before your eyes!!

There's a couple of junk yards out near Ron Salmon's Bus Depot.  And a 
surprising number of buses.  I got an extended length rear view mirror from 
one, for an excited $5.  (hard to control the excitement over a special find 
like that.) The miror allowed me to see out the back window to the horizon 
when my bus' rear end was dragging -hey, no FART here, please!!- but I have 
since replaced it with an interior rear view mirror from an early Vanagon.  
Yes, they are a twist-on fit, and the first few years Vanagon rear view 
mirrors will fit.  It gives me some peripherial views of my right rear side 
window, so I can see the cars I am passing in the mirror, and not have to 
turn my head.  &lt;&lt;  OK, you can all stop your laughing now!! &gt;&gt;

As a starter, there are a few niceties you should observe.  Remember, the 
price on the items are 'sometimes' hard and fast, but mostly at the whim of 
the counter man.

1) no smoking
2) slow movements; let them get used to you, don't be in a hurry
3) no borrowing of tools
4) tip the help if you get help
5) the more you buy, the less the prices per item
6) if you have one piece of unidentifiable junk, and it is 10 minutes to 
closing, and there is no management around, chances are you will hear 'have 
a nice day' in appreciation for your patronage.  Has happened to me many 
times.

And DO ask around ! ! !  Ask every country gas station you stop at if they 
know of any yards that might have VW's or if there are any VW affectionato 
around.

In the country, if there is daylight and you see a VW bus at a private 
home/lot/trailer park, stop and 'halloooo the house' and gather some karma.

If you see any shop that looks interesting along a country road, stop and 
introduce yourself and express your interest in your VW.  Even if the 
proprietor is not into VW's, there may be some common ground, like a local 
camping spot or swimming hole, or a 'Grandma's Kitchen' four table family 
eatery, or a one-man auto upholstery shop that does custom work that can 
show you what he is doing . . .

It's not just junk yard hunting. It's a different attitude.

At the beach in eastern VA/MD/DE, if I am standing next to my '78 Westy with 
the top popped, I can stop just about anybody passing by and ask things like 
&quot;where can I get a shower&quot;, &quot;what good local bands are playing; where?&quot;, 
&quot;know any place I can get my flat tire fixed!!&quot;.

Try that without the VW next to you, and you will at best get a cold 
shoulder.  But with a VW bus, you could, at best, get invited to their home 
for XMas dinner -Charlie Ford-

It's an adventure, a different attitude you take on, and an opening of doors 
that you didn't even know were there.

Good luck.

Barry sends
