&gt; Gas pump receipt says 13.808 gallons in.

&gt; Question One:  Anyone have an estimate on how much further past &quot;R&quot; I had
&gt; before I'm going leather express?

Everyone is different. It all depends on the float arm adjustment. A lot has
to do with where it reads when the tank is full. If the needle goes way past
full, you will run out at E. If it reads full on the F, you will have a
cushion at E. I have mine set at F and I can go the width of the needle
below E before I am on fumes.....


&gt; Question Two:  How big is the tank on a '76 FI Westy?

Coasting in empty, the most I have put in my 77 is 14.7
