Subject: RE: removing rubberized undercoated on the undercarriage

Sam,

Try to find someone who can blast with dry ice (takes some special
equipment). Not cheap, but you don't have to worry about sand getting into
the wrong places, it takes off dirt, undercoating, rust, and loose paint,
but it will NOT damage good paint under the undercoating.

Only do this if the bus is a keeper - this is not cheap ...
