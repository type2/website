More stuff to check. . .  At least It wont cost me to check the tire
pressure!  Maybe.

I really don't think there is a problem with alignment, it rolls
straight, true, unless braking, but I will ask about it.

 Different Tire sizes?  No way unless a different tire were printed with
what is printed on all the other tires.  Plus they worked fine on our
'80 vanagon (THE VAN FROM HELL).

I'll get that alignment checked.

Thanks,

Lauria Watts.
