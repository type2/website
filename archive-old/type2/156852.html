&gt; Well, I was pondering the other day why I, an unabashed car nut, enjoy
&gt; driving my breadloaf so much.  I've owned several sports cars and  muscle
&gt; cars and I like going fast.  Especially around tight  corners.  I've been
&gt; bored sick driving most economy cars and  passenger sedans.  My favorites
&gt; are actually high-performance  four-door sedans.  My Taurus SHO was hot.

Well, really high performance cars tend to cause me to collect tickets!

Our Scion is pretty good around corners, but I just hate the way that FWD
cars steer.  Heavy and dead.  The shifter is rather notchy too, and just
doesn't have a natural feel.  It drives like an appliance.

When I want a &quot;sporty&quot; drive, I head for the Bug.  Light steering with
good feedback, and shifting that just seems to find the gears by itself.
No, I don't go to the point that things get sideways, but at least I can
downshift the bug effectively.

The VWs just feel as though I am more &quot;connected&quot; with the vehicle.

George
