Eron IS the crane 700 a CDI ignition? I have one, but thought it was just a
different type of petronix using an optical trigger instead of a magnetic
hall's pickup??
Thanks,
Courtney

I too like the Crane CDI's.  I've had one in my bus AND my (ex)bug.  Still
cranking right along.  I went with the 1000 instead of the 700.  Has a
rev-limiter connector, and variable, self-adjusting dwell.
