Subject: so42 icebox height/depth Q??

Hi all, I am rebuilding an icebox that was damaged and missing parts from a 69? to fit my 67. Can someone with an OG icebox (67 &amp; earlier) measure the depth of the side(s) as well as the height from floor to the top of the counter? I have a good idea but would like the exact dimensions from the factory if possible. Also, does anyone know if the sticker &quot;Campmobile&quot; is on the early models or just the bays? 
   
  Thanks for your time,
   
  Ken
