The 914 transaxle is a 901 and is the same transaxle that was used in late
60's 911s (except that it's turned around in the 914). The side-shifter
option wasn't added until 1972-1/2. If you can find an early 901 out of a
911 you'll be set. I've heard that in order to make the 901 fit in a bus,
you have to make sheet metal mods to the firewall and of course you'll have
to make custom shift linkage. The conversion has been done though, and the
neat thing is that you can bolt a Porsche 6 right up to it!

Have fun,

The 914 tranny turns backwards because the engine is mounted in front of
the tranny.  Also, the 914 tranny is a side shift, so unless you plan on
some serious time and money to develop a new shift linkage system for the
bus, you'll have to stick with the stock or modified bus tranny.


&gt;Hi Folks,
&gt;
&gt;Since I do a fair amount of highway driving, I was thinking about
installing
&gt;a custom low/high ratio 4-speed transmission or a custom 5-speed
&gt;transmission in my Bus so I can pull decent highway speeds without winding
&gt;out the engine too much.
&gt;
&gt;Then I got to thinking (always dangerous)...
&gt;
&gt;If the Type 4 engine really is the same unit that was used in the Porsche
&gt;914, then wouldn't the 914 5-speed transmission be a perfect fit?  I
realize
&gt;that going to Porsche parts immediately doubles the price, but it might be
&gt;something worth researching.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for any info.
&gt;
