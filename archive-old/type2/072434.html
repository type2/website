Subject: '79 Westy hesitation - Help
Content-Disposition: inline
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Greetings,

I'm just about out of ideas on this one, so I turn to your incredible
knowledge.

Symptom:  Engine cuts out (hesitates, coughs, sputters, etc...) during
acceleration at about the same RPM in each gear.  It is happening just as
I'm reaching the upper RPM of each gear, right before I should shift.   I can
give it more gas and accelerate through or back off the gas and it
catches.   Clear?  It's more difficult to put in writing than I thought.

Things that I've done:
New fuel filter, plugs (Bosch Platinum) cap/rotor/points.  Dwell set to 47
degrees, timing=7.5 degrees BTDC.  New vacuum hose connections.  I
switched back to the old Bosch Super's, it didn't improve.  If I advance the
timing, the affected RPM range is increased but still present.

I've searched the archives and have covered most of the things
discussed there.  Please help.  Could it be the vacuum advance on my
distributer.  I don't have an Advance Timing light, so I'm not sure of the
setting.  If I can't fix it, i&quot;m going to have to bring it in.  I'm getting kinda
frustrated!!

TIA
Rob
