Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Mosquito Nets Fit?

i agree with joe, i have both buses and a couple of nets hanging on the line. both 
nets have different snap patterns but both fit both buses. so if you acquire a net 
you can match up your own snap pattern. if you have snaps you may have to move some 
on the bus depending on which net you get.

&gt; 
&gt;&gt;Are the Mosquito nets found on Baywindows the same ones for the large hatch Splits?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Can't say for sure, though there are at least two different snap patterns on the bays.  I just put a bay screen in my 65 westy.  Some of the snaps 
&gt; mount on westy components (as opposed to directly on the bus).  If you don't mind relocating a snap base or two, it should fit fine.
