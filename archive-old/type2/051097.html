Subject: [T2] Install a Window

Volks,
   I have a '79 bus and I need to replace the rubber gaskets on the side
windows. I know that you are suppose to a rope in the gasket to make it easy
to install the window, however I need to know what size of rope do I use?

Any information will be greatly appreciated.
