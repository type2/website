Subject: wimpy tires

First I've got to give a collective &quot;thanks&quot; to everyone on this list.  =
I have had aircooled vdubs for 15 years now, and since subscribing to =
the list, my 1970 is running better than ever. DETAILS!=20

 My present concern is the tires currently running. The T2 library and =
current tire threads are suggesting D rated tires.  I really had no idea =
what I was running until this morning.

Goodyear Decathalon on the front: 195/75R14=20
                                                   max. load - 1400lbs.
                                                   max. pressure 35 psi
                                                   1 ply sidewall
  Kelly Explorer (Exploder?) on the rear: same specs as above.

Is this dangerous? All four have plenty of tread. Should I replace all =
of them, or maybe just the rear and run my tires on the front? =20

Thanks, Dave
