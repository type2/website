Buffalo Restorations has a good reputation for restoration of American
vehicles like Model As, etc.  I've never heard of them doing a VW [or any
other furrin' vehicle].

There are VW-specialist restoration shops in Western Washington, and usually
a couple of them have booths at OktoBugFest in Puyallup [Oct. 15th].  I have
no firsthand experience with any of them, but some of their work looks
pretty nice.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  I've made an appointment with Buffalo Restoration in Puyall, do any
Puget Sound list members know their reputation.  &lt;&lt;
