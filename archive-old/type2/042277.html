&gt; Hope you don't mind a few lame questions...
&gt; 
&gt; 1. What's a &quot;dizzy?&quot;

Either (a) slang for a distributor or (b) how you feel after partaking in
enough of Germany's other most-famous product. Here it's usually (a).

&gt; 2. Distributor question: pull the wires and loosen the adjuster
&gt; bolt and the distributor comes out. Is there any way I can install
&gt; it (after new points, condenser) wrong? In other words, can it
&gt; go back in only one way? 1971 Westy

It can only go back in one way no matter what age or model VW you have. When
you reinsert it, leave the cap off. Put it down in the hole and grab the
rotor in one hand and the distributor body in the other. Turn the rotor
slowly while pushing down on the body. At some point you'll feel the
distributor drop into place. When it does, you're golden.

&gt; 3. In my rear view mirror, I noticed I get a puff of blue smoke
&gt; at each shift when going through the gears. Nothing visible on down
&gt; shifting. Rings?

Yeah.

&gt; It does consume oil, about 1 quart every 600 miles. I do have a
&gt; very livable, small leak coming from one of the oil plate nuts,
&gt; which will get fixed at the next change. Motor runs great and
&gt; gets about 19 MPG, closer to 20 on the freeway. Compression
&gt; 110,120,110,120. Its getting a little tired but still has a ways
&gt; to go. 

My favorite trick with those little nuts is to buy six split lockwashers and
use them instead of the copper crushwashers. Torque 'em to 60 inch-lb with a
1/4&quot; drive micrometer adjust torque wrench (JCWhitney has 'em--for my money,
this is the best thing in their whole catalog) and you'll be free from
leaks.
