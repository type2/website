Subject: Re: Busses as off-road vehicles

Boy, so much traffic on this -- I'll HAVE to join in, as this seems like
opinions and religiousness!

I drive often on the Pacheco road -- about 50 miles of required-headlights-
in-the-daytime road (well, down to about 20 these days) so I get to evaluate
all sorts of headlights in the daylight.  High beams *can* be too bright, but
never really a big problem.  Low beams (except motor-sickles) are the rule
there.

That said, I think that high beams make more sense off-raod.  Hell, most 
off-roaders use off-road lights -- your highbeams would burn out in shame
being compared to those non-projectile weapons!  You don't drive too fast
off-road.  I drive a Toyota, and you can walk faster than it drives.  But
it is *really* nice to know someone is coming a LONG way off.  Backing up
steep narrow paths is NO FUN! (Never back down -- it's the other guys
problem if you're the one going uphill)  I don't think lights at these
speeds should be a problem like is being discussed.

That said, most off-road VW's drive like crazy bats-outta-hell.  I avoid
the kinda place they drive.  Neither the syncro or my Toyota need apply.
High beams probably make no difference there, either.  Those guys are
likely to rear-end each other!
