So you don't have to waste bandwidth I just fixed the brake lights. Found
bad connection on brake switches on the master cylinder, bad ground on the
taillight housings ( I had run ground wires with self tapping screws into
the housings but one was lose), and a connecter pulled out. Thanks Thom for
the color wiring diagrams at vintagebus_dot_com   .
