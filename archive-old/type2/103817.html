&gt; Stock dist and Pertronix is a good solution. Keep points and

The dwell will increase some, but it's something you can't change so
where it is, is a good place :) Timing will change just like you
changed points with points. I have a spare distributor in the parts
box with points already installed, the only thing I need to add to it
is the retaining ring so that I can just swap the entire thing out if
need be &amp; the timing should be set :)
 
&gt; There are Pertronix versions I and II. The second version is better I've 
&gt; heard.

Unless it's changed the II version is somehow variable, but only
available for the 009 (non vacuum advance) model.

&gt; They require specific installation with a reduced voltage I think and a 
&gt; coil with a specific resistance. The archives has alot about it. I'll be 
&gt; the library does too. Versions I and versions II have different 
&gt; requirements.

My bosch blue coil fit the bill, so you may not have to purchase
anything else.

I really like my Pertronix unit.
