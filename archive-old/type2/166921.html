&gt; Can someone tell me how to get the driver's door

YES!!!! I just did this on my 71 and could not figure
it out either at first!! But, thanks to Bentley, I
discovered that you actually have to remove the vent
wing window frame in order to have the room to slide
out the window regulator.  The vent window frame
attaches via a few screws located under the rubber
seal onthe top of the window and a couple of screws
inside the door. Once you disconnect this thing and
slide it out of the way, you will have JUST enough
room to slide out the regulator.
PEACE! John Baker
