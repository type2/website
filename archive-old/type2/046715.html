Subject: [T2] Power brakes oops

Folks,
I recently corrected a listmember that he didn't have 'power brakes' - i said that he had 'vacuum assist brakes' and that there was a 'big difference' between the two.

Well, either it doesn't matter, no one noticed or i am such a consistent provider of false information that those who would correct me are ignoring it hoping others will as well. vacuum assist is the 'power' that makes power brakes 'power brakes'. My apologies.

Here's a link to a 'power brakes' explanation on a great website for those who are new to mechanical things - especially automotive stuff.

Here's an animation of a &quot;VW&quot; engine:

learning to hold my tounge,

clark
