Subject: Fwd: Re: [T2] Annoying FI Issue w/ cold engine

&gt;Mike: Fascinating story about the multiple leaks.  Two questions:


&gt;  I have these symptoms but I had decided that vacuum leaks could not 
&gt;be the problem if the symptom disappears after warmup. Can you 
&gt;speculate as to why these symptoms go away after the engine is warm?

Secondly, how did you locate the leaks?

Jack
