All of your questions are answered in the archive/library at
http://www.type2_dot_com.  I'll run through some of your questions anyway.

&gt;    I'm about to embark on a journey, to rebuild a 1.8L to a 2.0L type IV. I
&gt;know I need a crankshaft and rods from a 2.0L, but what else might I need?

The pistons/cylinders are different.  1.8 pistons are 93mm and 2.0 pistons
are 94mm.  You might be able to use the 1.8 parts but you will lose a
little displacement and your compression ratio will probably be higher than
you want.

&gt;Also I might go to Hydraulic lifters/cam, does that require any machining?

No.

&gt;    I will be looking for a flywheel in good shape, to mate a 74 type IV to
&gt;a 72 type I tranny, I think a 200mm or 215mm works.

You should already have a 210mm or 215mm flywheel on the '74.  Either will
slide right into the '72 tranny with no modifications.

&gt;I'm also considering a
&gt;cooling conversion but it doesn't seem to work with FI, a lot of extra money
&gt;for the conversion, manifolds, carbs., and linkage.

Don't ditch the FI.
