I made one of canvas.  S Johnson owes me a favor, and is going to have
someone re-do it for me.  I was going to add a small piece of plexiglass as
a window.  With the one I have now, it works great to keep the heat in, and
I have mirrors on both sides, so vision isn't too bad.

The real-deal would be an abulance divider, which is a metal frame with a
sliding glass parition.  

Second best would be to modify the bus to use a partition from a panel...
