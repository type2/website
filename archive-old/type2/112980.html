&gt; Subject: Towing a Campermobile with a Vanagon?
&gt;
&gt; I have a 1984 Vanagon (1.9 L water-cooled engine, 4 speed manual) &amp; I
&gt; plan to tow a 1977 VW Camper (high top) from pasadena to Phoenix. Can I
&gt; do it with my vanagon? UHaul says my Vanagon lacks the &quot;weight&quot; to pull
&gt; the camper. I doubt them because they can be idiots about some things
&gt; (no offense to any listee working for Big Orange). So, Can I do it?

I'm usually quite brave when it comes to trips like this but I think its worth noting that less than 2 months ago 2 split window Busses were demolished doing basically the same thing. Unspoken in the original story was the implication that they must have been going pretty slow. They got rear
ended by a semi on the road from L.A. to Phoenix. Also unspoken was the fact that they were probably traveling at night because the towing vehicle would have died in the desert heat. If you decide to go through with this folly I suggest bringing all of your Christmas tree lights along to give
those vehicles traveling 90 mph (That's almost everyone, right?) a chance to see you.
