Subject: Response from Nokian

Here is the response I got from Nokian North America:

Hi Dave,
Our Hakka CS, CQ, and C2 lines are all load range D in
the 185R14 and 195R14.  These are not big sellers here
in North America so many dealers arent familiar with
them.  We do carry a complete stock on all of them, so
you should be able to source these without a problem. 
Thank you for contacting us.
Best regards,
David

I have additionally asked him for clarification on the
Haakka2 series as I have bben told they have something
we can use in that series also - I'll post it when I
get it.
