Subject: door handle

Does anyone have a picture of the interior door handle on their web page??  
I have an older bus and have no clue that the newer ones had it.

Also, from what it sounds like on the gas tank issue...there is a drain 
plug??  If so, can someone tell me where I can find it?

PS:  In Search of a stool and tent for 71 camper.

Nothin left to do but smile, smile, smile!!

&gt; &gt;From what I have seen, replacement plastic handles do not even hold up as 
&gt;well as the plastic originals. For the price(near $40), they should be 
&gt;something that should outlast the vehicle. I have been hunting around in


how very true, I finally got tired of em breaking and made my own out of
aluminum bar stock... not very pretty but has lasted many years
