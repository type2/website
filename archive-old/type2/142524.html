Subject: Re: [T2] Wax

Thanks Dave. I THINK that explains what the neighbor was doing last night... He has a big rig (privately owned and operated). He was drying it off with a leaf blower I think or drying some wax. Dunno. 

The carnuba wax did only last a short time for my daily drivers. I used Mother's several times with this result. 

The stuff I used this time was Eagle. I really like it but we'll see how long it lasts. Less gives better results like you mentioned Dave. Really showed me how badly I needed to wax the Cabrio. 

Been watching the first two seasons of Magnum PI. LOTS of VWs everywhere. In fact Magum passed the same partially primered Beetle with surf boards twice in the same chase last night... &lt;grin!&gt;
