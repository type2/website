FWIW.....

Right now Harbor Freight has a nice combination digital &amp; analog multimeter
on sale for ~$20..00, which includes a temperature probe.  Certainly not for
dash installation, but that temp. probe might be useful for a quick
roadside/workshop temp. check.....

&gt;&gt;  ...How do you know if your engine ('71 Type 1 1600 DP in a 66 bus) in
your vintage bus is too hot WITHOUT GAUGES?  Is Muir's suggestion of &quot;If you
can hold the dipstick in your hand for a couple of seconds without burning
your fingers off, then your engine is running cool enough&quot; an accurate
standard by which to measure?  Anyone have any other little tricks for
estimating engine temp??  &lt;&lt;
