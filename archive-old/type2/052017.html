Subject: [T2] VWoA selfish/stupid/paranoid... sales thought vs legal thought

Not to add to an already growing thought process on the subject, but.........
Does anybody have the real URL or snail mail addresses to where we 
should/can  post our thoughts on this matter?

Seems to me that VWoA would like to make new unit sales market thrusts 
playing off of sentimentality,
and, at the same time, perhaps with another unknowing hand,
act stupidly to hurt those of us who continue to promulgate same.
