Subject: Anyone able to tow? Will pay (San Francisco CA)

Hello listers,

I have a 1983 aircooled Vanagon that's stranded in my driveway... I'm
moving out of my place today and need to get it from San Francisco to
Fred's Garage down in Redwood City (27 miles). Local tow companies are
quoting me an arm and a leg - in anyone able to help me out with a
tow?

I can pay $100+ to anyone kind enough to help. Needs to be today,
preferably around noon.

Any help MUCH appreciated!

Cheers,
Mike.
