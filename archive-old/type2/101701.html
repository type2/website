Subject: Re: [T2] Q-Pad substitute

One of the guys in the club told me one time that some of the early
vw manuals recomended rubbing your drained engine oil back on the 
underside of the pan to keep it from rusting....

Just hearsay at this point unless someone has an early owner's manual
that really does say that!

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hey, you forgot chain saw bar oil, that's some really good sticky stuff.  I
&gt; think it was the NE bus people, or maybe the Canuks who said they spray the
&gt; underside with the stuff every fall.
