Subject: funny sign

Drove up to a red light today behind a big, military-looking sort of  hi-tech dump truck.  It had a big, black, square body with some  kind of lift in the middle.  I'm sitting behind it wondering what  the heck it was when I saw the big, black on yellow sign across the  back:  STAY 50' AWAY.  I had to back over 3 cars!  Nah,  but I had to laugh.  I wish I could find one of those for the back  of the Bopmobile.  I do detest tailgaters.  Cheers....KR
