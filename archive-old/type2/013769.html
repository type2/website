Make sure that when you install the seal that the seam ends up at the rear of
the engine - towards the front of the bus - up on the firewall.

Porbably obvious for most, but for whatever reason i installed mine so that
the seal was donw under the cooling fan. You can never get the ends to meet,
so there's always a little gap - best that the gap not be directly under the
fan, where it will suck in hot exhaust/heated air.

&gt; the engine is in the compartment?

The engine seal is put in after
the engine is installed.  You may have to work the engine seal from above
and below, it takes a little time, but well worth it.
