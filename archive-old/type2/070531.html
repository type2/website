Someone one was asking about an altimeter in a bus.  The resulting thread covered altimeter functions in GPS.

The Garmin eTrex Vista has both a GPS and barometric altimeter.  It is a handheld unit, but systems for mounting it in a vehicle are available.  Unit also has an electronic compass and mapping.  Street price: $300-$350.
