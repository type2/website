Subject: need valve job description

Folks,

I really need a good description of what is commonly refered to as a
&quot;3 angle valve job&quot;.  With 6 vw's I need to start doing my own valve jobs.

I have found a company that sells manually operated seat cutters(expensive
but good) and need to know what angles are involved in the &quot;3 angle valve
job&quot;.

Any article references would be great.  At one time I found a great URL on
the net, but have lost it.


Thanks ,dave
