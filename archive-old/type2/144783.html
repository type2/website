&gt; List,
&gt; 
&gt; I am going to Ohio to help a friend pick up a '70
&gt; bus and bring it home to
&gt; Toronto.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know if you can get a temporary permit
&gt; in Ohio?


As far as I know, he cannot get a tag in Ohio witout
being an Ohio resident. I'd suggest he make
arrangements to get the title BEFORE getting the bus,
and us it to get the tag in his home
county\state\province.
