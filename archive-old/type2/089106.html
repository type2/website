Subject: Re: [T2] VW Trends Turbo Articles

Why not go all the way and fit a Judson supercharger!
VW fitted them to some early Beetles (for racing I think). Not sure if they
ever made in into a Bus.
At least it would be a period item, and is an easy fit to a type 1 motor.
That's if you can find one. (let me know if you do, I have a nice '55 beetle
to fit it to :-)
