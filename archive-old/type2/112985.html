Subject: Steering wheel shaft

Does anyone have an extra steering wheel shaft for a 76-79 bus that
they're looking to get rid of?  For some odd reason mine's bent where
the steering wheel attaches to it so I wanted to change it out.  I don't
know what years this part would be the same, but I'd guess that 76-79 it
wouldn't change too much.  I have a 78 westy.

Thanks,
Mike
