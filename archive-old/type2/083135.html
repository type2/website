is on our website (http://www.northwestvwclub_dot_org/) 
in the Spring Meet Preregistration Area under Spring
Meet.  Just fill in the info and click Submit!  You
can also 
download the Pre-registration form in either .PUB or
.GIF format.  If none of these will work for you, just
let me know and I'll get a form out for 
you.  (But all these are much faster than Snail Mail.
