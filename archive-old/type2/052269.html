Subject: [T2] Type IV engine questions

Planning on tearing into my 1800 motor in my 74 bus this weekend. 
Serious oil leak problems as well as a recent loss of power.
Plan on looking at the oil cooler, pushrod tubes etc...

My question is on what to do if the engine is not worth fixing.
Where is the best place to get a replacement?  How much $$ ?

Where is the best place to get a kit for a rebuild? How much $$  ?

Has anyone purchased from Raby's ?  They have an extensive website about
Type IV motors, but no prices, and wont give you a quote unless you call.

Anybody have a speare engine within 500 miles of Abilene, Texas?

Thanks,
