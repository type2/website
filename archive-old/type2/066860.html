Hi Tom,

I am potentially very interested in one of these heaters. Just a few
questions, that others might want answers to as well(pardon me if they've
been answered before):

- -Are these heaters made specifically for automotive use?

- -Is the fan adjustable or one-speed?

- -Any specs on the current draw or propane use rate (per hour or whatever)?

- -Is the &quot;mushroom cap&quot; mentioned in the archive included?

- -What is the warrantee? I assume that we'd have to pay shipping back to
England...


Thanks for your time and effort in putting this together,

Jon
