The guy, Chris, goes by JordanVW_at_aol_dot_com was and still might be selling the
carpet. I bought an entire set from him, for my 83 automatic. But he sent me
the front carpet, Brown, for a standard shift. let me know if you want it.

sale. Anybody have a tan front carpet fror an 83.5 V'gon, standard shift,
in good shape?
