Subject: Re: GEX Fallout

Todd Wrotre:
... you said that your Bus needs work in other areas, right? Your
&gt;best bet is to try to fix up your bus, with the GEX motor in there. Just
&gt;use the GEX motor for what it's worth and for as long as it'll last.

You are probably right and that is what I will have to do.

&gt;By the way, you don't happen to own a 1982 Pontiac TransAm, do you?
&gt;(sorry, bad joke)


No I don't believe in Pontiacs, HAHA! I have heard that joke so many times 
that it is offensive...when someone doesn't ask.
Normal Questions are:
Do you have a black car?
Do you own a Transam?
Where's KIT?
Do you everget dizzy staring at Kit's Light? MY answer is no because it runs 
my battery down to leave it on.

Now I think I can leave it on if I use a solar charger for my Battery.


Thanks,

Michael Knight
