Subject: Stranded Man on Van Dorn Street
Date: Tue, 22 Dec 1998 19:43:19 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I was reading through all the messages, including the one about the man
stranded near Van Dorn Street in Alexandria, VA.  Since I don't have any
parts, etc. to help out, I erased the messages.

Then I got to thinking that it's getting cold outside and the man might have
more immediate needs than parts.  Does anyone know if this man needs
blankets or food?  Is the person who wrote the messages willing to collect
items for this person?

Looking forward to hearing from you.
