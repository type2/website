Subject: Re: [T2] Thing Gas Heater in '69 Bus?

Mike,

I would urge you not try to feed into the existing heater ductwork.  It
might work.  I thought of doing it myself, but I'm glad that I didn't. The
quantity of air pushed by the Eberspacher heater is substantial. I'm not
sure the existing bus system would allow it to pass as freely as the
dedicated system.

&gt; I was going to install it using the existing ducting from somewhere close
to
&gt; the heater boxes, instead of worrying about drilling Big Holes in the
&gt; passenger portion of the Westy. Any advice?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks -
