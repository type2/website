Subject: CV Boots

My CV boots don't seem to last long either. May-be a year. Does the collective 
wisdom have any thoughts on this...

I've considered looking for stronger Urathane boots but I've never seen
any that would fit my 73.

A split boot is (unfortunatly) NOT SUITABLE. 

On the bus (unlike the bettle) the boots attach to the rotating axle and 
gearbox diff/wheel. A split boot would cause accelerated CV joint wear, and
because the joint is non flexible would probably tear quicker.


As a tip for tools while changing the CV boots I've found a 'Wobble bar' 
extention for my socket set realy good - it gives sufficient movement to allow 
the socket driver to be fitted and isn't floppy/uncontrollable like a 
universal joint. Cost 4 UK pounds = $6 US.
