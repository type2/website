Subject: RE: I need equivalent color for 71 Westy [Chianti Red]

There is a code associated associated with the color &quot;Chianti Red&quot;, code L82
or something like that.  Behind the driver's seat is/was a silver colored
sticker with black lettering that will have that code.  Or, you should be
able to find it on the WW site.  In any case, any auto paint supplier should
be able to match colors based on that code.  That's what I did when I had
mine painted.  True, there will be an aging affect that will result in a
difference between the old original paint inside and your new paint outside,
but I found this to be very slight after I repainted my Chianti Red 71
Westy.

Hello,

I just bought a 71 westy with pretty much original equipments in it and I
love it!!!

The paint inside is almost like new and out side needs painting. I went to
http://www.wolfsburgwest_dot_com/colors/7172bus.htm and it lists Chianti Red
only red color for that year. I went to local paintshop and they could not
pull that particular color out of their computer system because the original
is lacquer based and California no longer allows lacquer based paints. So, I
am desperate trying to find out what the formula for that original color is
or at least the most similar color to Chianti Red. Does anyone have any
idea? For now, I went to the paintshop and had a swatch brought out and
found a similar color as the original paint inside, but I have a worry that
the inside color, after 30 years, may not show the true original color and I
might end up with totally different color bus. I am painting two tone, red
bottom and pastel white top... Your help will be greatly appreciated. My
email is nyblues99_at_yahoo_dot_com.

Thanks!!!
