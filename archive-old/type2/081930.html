Subject: Re: [T2] Is this the right clutch?

Wrong wrong wrong!!  That is a type1 disc. It should measure 210.



   Hi All.

   Just recieved a clutch disk that I ordered  for my 1700cc 73 bus and am
confused in that the clutch disk measures exactly 200mm in diameter.
The correct disk is a 210mm disk. Question is do I have the right one?
  My bus is still in storage so I havn't pulled the old clutch out yet to
compare.
   The disk has the name LUK on it as well as the # 215 03 if that matters.
Also it is a 4 spring clutch.
  The supplier I bought it from thinks it is correct and I believe him but
just wanted to make sure.
