Subject: Re: [T2] undercoat-Cosmoline?

I haven't had to clean any of that stuff off in years!!  That was what all
the military stuff had all over it.  When shipping overseas, everything was
coated in cosmoline.  It was kind of waxy, but a little greasy too.

After a few years, it would become pretty tough and was a bear to remove.  I
sure did keep bare metal from rusting and I'll bet it would keep rusty metal
from getting any worse.  It could be removed with rubbing alcohol.

The stuff the WWII guys had to use in the islands would stay pretty clean as
long as you didn't remove the cosmoline.  It may do a nice job on the
busses, maybe spraying it inside the pillars, lower panels and doors would
really help, sure wouldn't hurt.
