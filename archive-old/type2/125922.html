&gt;If the car has been recently run you'll still have residual pressure in the

Before my engine went back in I performed a lot of fuel pump testing off the vehicle. These were my observations:

- fuel pressure will hold overnight if your PR isn't leaking and the check valve in the pump is good and there is fuel in the tank. After 8 hours I still had over 20 psi in the fuel rail.

- the fuel pressure takes only a few seconds to reach maximum. Any lag I noticed was due to the length of fuel line I was using for my tester.
