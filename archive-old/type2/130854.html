Subject: Re: [T2] Sliding Door (Painting Question)?

Hi Chris,

http://homepage.mac_dot_com/ratwell/Microfiche/t207400.gif

That rear latch is actually part of the U-arm assembly. Since the U-Arm 
is the only point of contact between the body of the bus and the rear 
edge of the door, there is no rear latch without the U-arm.

Happy trails,
