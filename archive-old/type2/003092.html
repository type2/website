Something happened to me today that has never happened in over 20 years of
VW ownership.  My 82 Westy left me stranded.  I was driving normal on the
way to the doctor when it just stopped.  No muss, no fuss.  I put it into
neutral &amp; all the lights come on.  I have lots of cranking power.  I did not
have time to troubleshoot it then but I am going back in a hour.  I bet that
the new Pertronix I put in two weeks ago failed.  I very seriously doubt it
was fuel as there was absolutely no spitting or sputtering.  I will keep you
all informed.  Thanks for letting me vent.
