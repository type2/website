Moore, Michael R sends:

&gt; zero emissions just means the car doesn't  emit.  the commercials never talk
&gt; about how much more is going to be emitted from the eletricity plants that
&gt; have to power these cars.
&gt; 
&gt; all we do is go from a bunch of smaller polluters to a couple of really
&gt; large pollulters, unless we are able to move to renewable energy resources
&gt; to power the plants.

It depends on the part of the country you're in. Many of the folks in the
Northwest, as long as they're not shipping it all off to California, get all
their electricity from hydroelectric generators--dams. This doesn't pollute
at all; the dam either has a pipe coming out the bottom of it or flows over
a roller, the water turns turbines, the turbines turn alternators, the
alternators turn out enough electricity to keep you going. Some places have
big windmills, and they work fairly well too.
