Subject: Re: [T2] One version of why we are &quot;orphans&quot; of VW

I was going to stay out and just enjoy this thread, but the comment 
below reminded me of what I was told by Obie Bradshaw, owner of Obie's 
Domestic and Import Auto Repair in Pendleton, OR.

Up until 2003, Obie's was a VW Authorized Auto Repair Facility. In 
2003, Obie declined to renew his association with VW.  The reason? VWoA 
insisted that he purchase $160k of new 'approved' tools to deal with 
vehicles like the Phaeton.  Obie ended a thirty year relationship.

Can't say as I blame him.

And he's still the very best shop in the area. A shop that you could 
send the in-laws to.

&gt; I got to talking to one of them, and they said that they no longer 
&gt; even have the tools to work on these vehicles anymore. Any special 
&gt; dealer service tools they might have had, they got rid of long ago. I 
&gt; asked them if they could do an alignment and they said they don't even 
&gt; have the proper programming / setup to do it with their computerized 
&gt; machine.
