Al
I have the opportunity to buy a 1958 single cab with the original motor.  It
is buried with a bunch of VW parts.  What should I look for as possible
problem areas.?  It has been where it is for a long time!!!  But it supposed
to roll.  Rocker on at least one side is gone.  Couldn't get to the other
side because of all the parts stacked on and in it.
Would love to talk to other '58 owners if you are out there and have the
time.  Please.  All he is asking is $750.  A few years ago a friend of mine
that is a fireman got called to the house and saw just a whole back yard of
VW stuff.  He called me and I went by and it freaked the guy when I knocked
on his door and was wondering about his VW stuff as he has a tall fence
around his property.  But he was cool when I told him who I was and he kept
my name and address and came to my house this morning and is ready to unload
it.  Probably the county getting on him but is $750 a good deal.  Did the
58 have the cast in generator stand?
Any and all help appreciated!!!!!!Robert Laffoon

&gt; &gt; A gold star to wear on your forehead for the first one to get the right
&gt; &gt; answer to this one.
&gt; &gt; '57  36 horse motor.  Bone stock.  VJR4BR dizzy.  105-110 PSI
compression.
&gt; &gt; Tune up spec's are right on.  Stock exhaust, 28 PCI carb and hand choke.
&gt; &gt; 6V system.
&gt; &gt; New plug wires (Bosch), dizzy cap, rotor.
&gt; &gt; Plugs aren't too old and just cleaned and re-gapped.
&gt; &gt; #1 cylinder isn't firing, 2 thru 4 are.
&gt; &gt; Lift the high tension lead out of the dizzy tower for #1, about 1/4&quot;
above
&gt; &gt; it, and then the sparks jump from the lead down into the dizzy tower
&gt; &gt; opening for #1 and the cylinder picks up and the motor purrs.
&gt; &gt; Changed wires for #1 and same as above.
&gt; &gt; Changed rotor...same
&gt; &gt; changed dizzy cap....same
&gt; &gt; It's only doing it on #1.  Push the high tension lead firmly into the
cap
&gt; &gt; and the cylinder dies.  Pull the lead out so there's a bit of air space
&gt; &gt; between it and the cap tower and the sparks jump the air gap and the
&gt; &gt; cylinder fires.
&gt; &gt; I've been on this list for awhile.  Haven't asked a whole lot of
questions
&gt; &gt; cuz I've been able to figure it all out.  So far anyways.
&gt; &gt; I'm hoping that there is another out there that has had a problem like
&gt; &gt; this and has already figured it out.
&gt; &gt; I haven't looked the #1 plug over completely...scrutinized it so to
speak
&gt; &gt; but I will be putting in new plugs tonight just to rule that part of the
&gt; &gt; puzzle out.
&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance.
&gt; &gt; later
&gt; Steve:
&gt; Have you adjusted the valves? (You didn't mention it).
&gt; The reason that #1 fires when you pull the wire out a ways is that the
&gt; gap makes the voltage build up and spark at a higher voltage. It's
&gt; possible new plugs will cure this. The other possibility is that the
&gt; mixture is not spot on- too rich or too lean. Since it's the secon
&gt; cylinder of the firing order pair, I'd guess too lean. Is this symptom
&gt; just at idle or thruout the rpm range?
&gt; Might be time to check the float level or take carb apart and clean the
&gt; jets.
