Subject: Re: [T2] i got a call back from sirius radio and i gave them my
  demands

-- I'm confused. Is this a hostage situation or are you negotiating a
contract?

Maybe using the word &quot;terms&quot; or &quot;conditions&quot; rather than &quot;demands&quot; would
make for a less tense sounding situation.

Cheers,

Duke

initially used by the 'promotions department', not by the listee...
