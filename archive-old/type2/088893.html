Subject: Re: [T2] Distributor Vacuum Advance(Is this correct)??  

[...]

&gt; &gt; &gt; No fuel injected 1800 [ED
&gt; &gt; &gt;engine]
&gt; &gt;ever timed at that number. The correct figure is 5 after. BUT this is &gt;only
&gt; &gt;if
&gt; &gt;the retard side has vacuum and it is at idle.
&gt;
&gt; I may have remembered wrong while posting...it could very well have been 5
&gt; after...there is a red dot on the dial that I was setting it to.
&gt;
&gt; I've been setting the timing with the engine shut off and with a volt meter
&gt; measureing where the distributor got power...is this the wrong way??

YES, IT IS WRONG!!!!

You CANNOT static time a dual vacuum unit distributor to the specs listed.

You HAVE to be at IDLE with VACUUM connected to the retard side.

Boy, does this get old!!
