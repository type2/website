Subject: Battery Isolator Problem

Hello.  I just bought a battery isolator from Napa.  I printed out the
instructions from the tech library on how to install one of these things but
things aren't going so smooth.  The bus had some kind of isolator in it
before but it was much smaller.  It had four wires as described in the tech
library: one  going to the (+) auxiliary battery, one going to the (+) main
battery, one going to a harness mounted on the firewall and one to ground.
I would have no problems if the new isolator looked like the old one but
unfortunately it doesn't.  Instead it has a post for the (+) main wire
marked &quot;1&quot;, a post for the (+) auxiliary battery marked (2), and post
labeled &quot;A&quot; which goes to (+) on the alternator (??).  And finally a post
labeled &quot;E&quot; which goes to several places, depending on what kind of vehicle
you are putting it on.  On imports it goes to a regulator harness and taps
into wire &quot;IG&quot;  (??) and on a GM car it goes to the center ignition
position.  There is no post for ground on this thing so now I am totally
confused.  The guy at Napa told me this would work.  Is there anyone who can
make sense of this?
