Subject: its different for dome lights

5 points to anyone who can spot the early-80s music ref!

anyways... my front dome light on the 70 deluxe is shot - stays on 
alla time whether door is open or not. i guess it is so corroded 
internally  that it no longer can tell the difference. all wiring TO 
the light seems in order.

so i was looking for some online (bustedbus has them, but $35 is out 
of my league right now), and am talking with a vendor who INSISTS the 
front and rear dome lights are the same on an early bay. i say nertz; 
the front has connections for THREE wires, the rear only two. in 
addition, the front light has a 3-position switch, while the back has 
just 2 positions.  well, at least the ones on MY bus are like that!

anyone care to parse the details... karl ?  :)
