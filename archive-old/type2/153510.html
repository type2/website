Subject: CHT Wows and Concerns

Today was the first time I've taken my bus (79 Westy) for a long ride since
installing my CHT gauge and it was a very hot day here in Connecticut -
upper 80s to 90 degrees.  So, seems to be working well until I start
climbing long hills and the temp reading starting going up and up - to and
slightly above 450 - at which point I got off the gas.  From everything I've
read in the archives, this is not a good thing.

 

Now, I'm not sure if my gauge is accurate or if I've really got an issue.
I'll be doing some research over the next time period.

 

Here is my question. if I really am running that hot - when might I expect
to trash the head and/or drop a valve?  Does it require one to drive at high
temps for a long time to toast a valve or does it go very quickly when the
engine overheats.  Or, am I just doing more and more damage as I drive with
a hot cylinder head?  How hot is really too hot?

 

Happy father's day to all.

 

TIA,

 

Wayne
