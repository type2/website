Subject: Found my 74 parts, Thanks Dustin Fitch [Friday Post]

     Wanted to take a minute to publicly thank and praise Dustin.  He's a 
shining example of how great people on this list are.  I wish everybody was 
as nice and just plain cool as the folks are on this list.  The world would 
truly be a better place.  It really makes me anxious for the day that I can 
help someone else as much as I have been helped and am sure I will be helped 
in the future by those on this list!
