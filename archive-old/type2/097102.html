Subject: Re: [T2] 1st year sunroof

I just looked in my 68 and 69 sales brochures...
Both say &quot;Get a wagon with a sliding roof* and settle for open space.&quot;

*optional at extra cost

Then I went to my 68+ parts book. Steel sunroofs came on models 225, 228, 235,
241, 244, 251, and 285 from chassis no. 228 133164. This means 68 models.....
sorry, I do not know when in the production of 68's #133164 was made.

And all 68-72 pop top Westies were built from sunroof buses.




&gt; can any one tell what was the first year for factory sunroof editions, 'cuz
&gt; i hardly rarely ever maybe never heard of a 68 or 69. and last week i saw
&gt; that a pilot was selling sunroof cables on that dasterly son of the devil
&gt; auction site for 70 thru 90 buses. could 70 be the first year on that?    -
