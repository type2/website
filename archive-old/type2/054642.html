Subject: master cylinder replacement and brake bleeding

Hi Andy --
  you wrote:
&quot;My much messier process is to install the reservoir, fill, and
submerge all of the open
ports in a bucket of brake fluid, pump manually until no bubbles, wipe
and install. the bucket of fluid is still fresh so i dump it back into
the containers and use it for the bleeding......&quot;

Some purists on brake fluid will argue against this, especially if
there is some kind of contamination on the outer surfaces of cylinder
and/or reservoir..... but I have done the same thing when I couldn't
find my bench bleeder tubes.  I did, however, scrounge a couple of
coffee filters from the kitchen, put the filters in a funnel, and then
filtered the fluid before putting it into the system.  Also I like to
run the cylinder casting and the reservoir [previously cleaned
internally with BBs and detergent] through the dishwasher before
reassembly......  when the Frau is not around, of course.

I am a big fan of Dow Corning silicone grease.  But that is another
topic.  Good luck with your brake projects.

Glenn
