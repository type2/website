Subject: RE: [T2] T2 in Edmonton


hi Duane,

excellent parts supplier here in Calgary called Concept-1 VW. very
reasonable prices and super friendly guys. I noticed when I was at their
show this summer that many guys from Edmonton were buying tons of stuff and
I continually overheard that there was nothing in Edmonton. There is a place
called punch buggies unlimited but I have not been there yet so I don't know
what they are like. Don't know of any gurus.

cheers,
