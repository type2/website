Hi,

Ken Hooper pines, &quot;Nobody can work with wide fives here either.&quot;


Stay away from those tire shops that are near shopping malls. I have had
success working with a shop that services small and medium commercial
trucks. They did quite a fine job balancing the wide fives on the '69. Even
had a few choice words for  whoever did  the last balancing. Seems they just
slapped on a couple of pounds of lead where a few ounces would do just fine.
