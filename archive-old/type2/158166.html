Subject: Re: [T2] Help with impossible nuts!

&gt; Hey there folks
&gt; &gt;These nuts are so rusty/rounded off that a regular socket just spins
around
&gt; &gt;the nut.  I hope thats not too confusing.
&gt;
Not at all...What you want is a set of &quot;barbed&quot; or &quot;salvage&quot;
sockets...Available
thru most decent tool suppliers...They're only good for one thing; removing
rusty/rounded nuts. The socket is hammered onto the nut and the barbs bite
into the nut... ;-)
