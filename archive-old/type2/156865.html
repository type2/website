Subject: Re: [T2] Annapolis MD Mechanic/Body Work Needed

You've got some wife there.  Buy her a dozen roses tomorrow.   I lost a 
primo '72 Monte Carlo to one who wasn't so  understanding.  She ran it 
out of water, blew the head gasket, and  then 'couldn't justify' fixing 
it.  I should have taken the car  and run before she took me.  Live and 
learn.  Cheers...KR

use the term loosely), my wife and I have reached an agreement that  
allows me to get the bus back in daily driver condition.
