Subject: Re: westy front curtain

Oh yeah. Duh..the 73 interior was cloth. I need the vinyl cushion. I believe
its probably 72 only, but can someone confirm this? Maybe the 71 would fit,
but I am pretty sure the 68-70 jump seats were wider.

Thanks for the responses so far!!

Subject: westy front curtain


&gt; I have an original Westfalia early bay or late split front windshield
&gt; curtain I don't need. It is the one that covers only the windshield and
not
&gt; the front doors (they had the slider type front curtains). It is in great
&gt; condition. I hate to sell it so I would trade somebody something for it.
&gt;
&gt; I need for my 72 westy:
&gt;
&gt; cylinder head temp gauge
&gt; 72/73 jumpseat &quot;butt&quot; cushion
&gt; new rear hatch seal
&gt; 2 new front door seals
&gt; late Eberspacher heat duct (thru the firewall)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Maybe something else. Pmail me if you are interested. I am in Charlotte
and
&gt; could deliver to Everybus. If I don't get something nice for it I am going
&gt; to raffle it off at Everybus for the Jonathan Walker fund.
