Subject: oil leak
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I have a '75 bus and it is leaking oil big time. It seems like it is coming 
from the oil coolant (according to 'How to keep your VW alive') and it only 
leaks when i run it. Has anybody have had this problem before and how can I 
confirm that it is a leak from the coolant before I order the part to replace 
it.
