Subject: Oil, Oil everywhere!!
Message-ID: &lt;0.90d1bf0.25537a74_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Well, enough said about the red light and on to next problem.  I was going 
into town, about 10 miles, and could see a bluish gray cloud following me.  
So I left off the gas and baby'd it to town.  Stopped, walked around to the 
back and notice a fairly large puddle growing with time.  So I grab a rag and 
start wiping.  All the oil gone lets take a closer look.  I grab on the oil 
filter to check tightness and it spins almost a full turn, wow.  Meanwhile 
oil is now in the heat exchangers, the fan, the alternator and sprayed 
loosely everywhere.  But I know this isn't the whole problem.  So guys and 
gals if you can e-mail me with your list of top ten spots to find oil leaks, 
I will calculate, average, and post the results.  But while your thinking go 
check that oil filter. What a mess.
Peace Out
Rick
