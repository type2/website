Subject: [Q] (Starting) Electrical Problem ('71 Camper)

Greetings Group,

I have a '71 Camper with an unusual electrical problem.  Sometimes it will
start, sometimes it won't.  Here are some details:

-  Have only owned the '71 for about two months.
-  Sometimes it will sit for a couple of days between starts, sometimes
   it only sits for a couple of hours (it has both started and failed to
   start in each of these scenarios).
-  When it does start, it cranks right up -- starter and battery seem to
   be fine.
-  When it doesn't start, I still get the oil light and &quot;other&quot; red light
   on the speedometer to come on (as they always do when starting).  (I
   don't remember what the &quot;other&quot; light is -- duh.)

Any thoughts?  Maybe a short in the ignition switch?

Some additional details:

-  There was a custom radio installed before I bought the '71.  When the
   '71 starts, this is sometimes on, sometimes off.  Mostly off after
cranking.
   It will intermittently come on while tooling down the road.  When the
   '71 doesn't start, the radio comes on as soon as I hit the ignition
swtich.
   Maybe these are related?
-  When I picked up the '71, the headlights weren't working.  I wired the
   driver's side light to the hot side of the fuse panel which turns both
   lights on.  As the '71 had a customer-installed kill/master switch
installed,
   this is how I turn off the lights and shut down after each trip.  The
   lights are (obviously) on the entire time I'm driving.

As this is my almost-daily driver, even a bandaid-type solution would be
nice!  I want to get her up and running quickly, and can backfill with a
&quot;real&quot; fix over an upcoming weekend.

Kind Regards,
David
