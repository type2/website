FWIW,

My PHLEGM (phairly local elite guru mechanic) once mentioned that a phlat
cam could also cause popping on deceleration. It was in passing
conversation, so I didn't pursue it at the time. Hope that isn't your
problem, though.

&gt; &gt;Hey Volks, My bus keeps backfiring. It seems like it
&gt; &gt;does it more often when I'm downshifting. My engine is
&gt; &gt;a 78 with dual carbs..if that helps any. Any help is
&gt; &gt;appreciated. Anyone know what could be causing this.
&gt; &gt;She runs great..just backfires a good bit.
