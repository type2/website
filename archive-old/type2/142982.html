Subject: Wife sez the bus isn't reliable enough to go to California!

Arrgghh!!

We were talking about the trip to Cali in October that we've been
planning. I mentioned that I'm spending this weekend under the bus to
find out just why I'm having such a rash of little issues. She said
it's fine for puttering back and to work, but she doesn't trust it for
anything else.

I think the triggers were the fact that my less than a year old Kragen
starter is going out and the bolts that hold the steering column to
under the dash popped out the other day (I have no idea what that was
about. There's one bolt left. They're getting replaced tomorrow).

But how do I explain that busses were MADE for these kinds of
trips?!?!?! If I can't convince her then it's either Grayhound or
Frontier Airlines. :(
