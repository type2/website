Subject: Re: [T2] Horsepower Numbers

I have to &quot;LOL&quot; at this discussion of horsepower, because I wrote a 
newspaper column earlier this week comparing horsepower to the Richter 
scale and noting how meaningless both numbers tend to be in the course 
of ordinary  affairs. All that matters to me is whether a vehicle feels 
&quot;peppy&quot; when I drive it. My VW GTI is peppy. My bus is peppy enough at 
low speeds and in low gears, on the flat or going downhill.

All you really need to know about bus horsepower is that there isn't 
enough of it to keep up with traffic when ascending inclines, and there 
usually isn't enough of it to pass cars safely on twisty two-lane 
highways. On the other hand, it's a darn sight easier to keep a bus in 
a garage than to stable 65 horses.

Mark &quot;what's it to me&quot; Hineline
