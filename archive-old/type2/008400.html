Don't know if I am lucky or not.

Found a 1978 VW bus advertised as &quot;needs work&quot; $400 obo.
Went and looked at it - 4 new feet, very little surface rust, hacked up
interior (guy thought he was a cabinet maker of some sort) and an 
angle iron front bumper with a reese tow bar mounted to it.  Doesn't 
run.

The guy called the local VW mech and was told it would cost at 
least $400 to fix it - been sittin for a year - offered $200 and 
towed it home (smiling all the way).

Put a wrench on the end of the crank after I got it home and was 
able to turn it over - happy, happy!!!

Need to charge the battery and see if it will start - old owner said 
it runs but that something is wrong with the FI - says it races when
started and has no throttle control.  Plan is to try to start it and see
exactly what &quot;races&quot; is - hopefully its a stuck butterfly, cracked 
vacuum hose or something simple and inexpensive like that.

Overall the body is in really good shape - spent its whole life on the
west coast until moving to CT four years ago.

Will keep everyone informed of how it turns out - gotta go do some
wrenching!!!!
