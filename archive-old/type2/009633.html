Subject: 81 vanagon conversion to carbs

Hello All,
I just recently converted my 81 vanagon to carbs from fuel injection.  
Everything went pretty well except for one thing. There is a oil breather- I 
think- that is located at the top of the motor.  When it was fule injected, 
it had a vacuum tube that connected to it, but now that it is carberated, it 
has no where to go.  If I plug it up, oil leaks out where the cap sits on 
the opening.  If I don't plug it, and let the tube hang there, it leaks some 
oil.  Not a tremendous amount, but enough to make me concerned.  What can I 
do with this?  Can I plug it off permanently?  Can I add an oil cooler to 
this?  It does not seem to move to much oil though.  Any help would be 
appreaciated. I want to finish off the conversion.  Thanks
Dan
