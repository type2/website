Subject: Re: [T2] Low oil pressure at idle

Change to straight 40 weight and add a half quart of motor honey (I like 
Morey's available at NAPA and other FLAPS), and keep the revs low to nurse 
it a little further. But you risk loosing the crank journals with more 
miles. Cut the crank and you cut it's life in half. If you get there soon 
enough, polish it only and it may well show within original specs and last 
another 100k+ miles. Those crank main journals will do 200k easy and be 
reusable for another 200k if they never see dirty oil and the cooling 
system is maintained reasonably. Save the crank by fixing it sooner rather 
than later.

&gt;I know the beast needs new mains, they are tired at 130,000 miles, but I 
&gt;want to drive it for the summer and do that in the winter.  Is there a 
&gt;bandaid fix
