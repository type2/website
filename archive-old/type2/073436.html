&gt;What's
&gt;the deal with the type 4 engine?  Are they reliable, or are they junk?

Reliable.

&gt;How much would an average rebuild cost?

About $1500 for an AVP engine.

&gt;Are parts as readily available as the
&gt;type 1?

Parts are available.  Not as readily as the type 1 but there are plenty of
sources.

&gt;I ask all this, because I'm not sure if I should keep it, or try to
&gt;find an earlier bus...say a '71.  Keep it or sell it, I can't lose seeing as
&gt;I got a good price on it... Any comments/advice?

Depends on you and your tastes.  They both have advantages and
disadvantages.  Personally I think the advantages of the type 4 engine
outweigh the disadvantages.  Check the archives for plenty of discussion on
this topic.
