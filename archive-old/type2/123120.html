&gt; the flex drive of the auto-stickshift is not a fully

&gt; a fully automatic transmission in it with a flex drive
&gt; and a torque converter in it.  The flex drive is the
&gt; same size og the t-4 flex drive, only the flywheel

hmmmm, don't remember the t-3 with an automatic, what years was that....??
