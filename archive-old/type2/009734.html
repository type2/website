Subject: Will a CW crank 'pay for itself'?
Message-Id: &lt;199906071229.FAA26673_at_helix.ucsd_dot_edu&gt;

Suppose you took a 2.0 L case, had it align bored, new bearings all the
way around, dropped in a counterweighted crank, balanced everything else,
ran synthetic oil, changed the oil at the regular interval. Could you
expect to get over 100,000 miles out of such a case? 150,000? More?

I am trying to decide whether the cost of a CW crank is justified by 
extended engine life.
