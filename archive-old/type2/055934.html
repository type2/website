I had to replace mine on my '67 Westy and it was quite an adventure finding
the part. Calling around to the usual mail-order VW parts houses did not get
me much joy. The only thing they had were kits that supposedly contained all
the brake tubing on the bus. I found one local shop that had several lengths
of straight brake tubing that could be bent to fit but they were either too
long or too short for my purpose. No one had this part by itself.

I finally found one in a junk yard on an early loaf. I think the tubing is
the same up through '70. Just don't make the mistake I made which lead to
all this. After doing a brake job and putting everything back together the
tube was rubbing on the drum and it did not take long wear through. There is
not a whole lot of clearance in there.

There should be two springs holding the shoes on, one above the spindle and
one below. Maybe one got left out of the kit? You can probably pick another
one up where you find the tubing.

Good hunting!

Marvin
