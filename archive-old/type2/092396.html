Subject: Re: [T2] fuel gauge sending unit

Thanks to all who responded.  It was indeed a broken little tiny wire on
the sender mechanism.  A new sender is on order.  This list is great!
thanks again, greg

&gt;&gt; Hey folks, on my 74 SC, the fuel gauge registers accurately when the tank 
&gt;&gt; is full and down about 6-8 gallons...when it gets to between 1/2 and 3/4 
&gt;&gt; full, the gauge very rapidly (like within 5-10 miles) falls down to 
&gt;&gt; completely empty.  Does that sound like the gauge or a faulty sending 
&gt;&gt; unit?  None of the manuals tell how to check for &quot;partial&quot; performance of 
&gt;&gt; the gauge.  Thanks, greg
&gt;
&gt;sounds like the sending unit, probably a broken wire on the pot.
