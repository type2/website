Subject: Re: [T2] for those who has space problem parking their van

&gt;Didn't you take a chainsaw??? 
&gt;
I tried to enlarge it with a chainsaw to make it trough, but I was stuck 
in the van and could not get out !! ;-)

&gt;Twenty four HUNDRED years? WOW!!!
&gt;  
&gt;
I wish you were speaking about my van !! ;-)

its the max date, probably for tourist (like me!) , no one was there to 
check it anyway !!!
I guest if no one would have cut it , it could live an another 500 
Years. Damn tourist !!!
