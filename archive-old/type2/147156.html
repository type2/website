Subject: Re: [T2] 82 Vanagon - Heater control flap housing

Bill,
I had a related question a few days ago, and here are the helpful 
responses I received.
The heater box connects via flexible metal tubing to a piece of tailpipe 
that extends rearward, is supported by attachments to the motor mount, 
and exits just behind the rear wheel.
http://www.shockwaverider_dot_com/newbus/picture-005.html shows a photo of 
the pipe, and
http://www.ratwell_dot_com/technical/Microfiche/t202410.gif shows the parts 
on the fiche.
