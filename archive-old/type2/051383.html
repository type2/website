Subject: [T2] hot wheel solved

Posted a couple days ago about one rear wheel getting hot after running, and
a few people told me to check the brake lines. I thought that was silly,
until I realized that the brake fluid gets shoved into the wheel cylinder,
but then can't get back out when you have a arterial sclorosis in your
flexible lines. I.E. you have a locked brake. Which is exactly what I had.

Thanks for the fine advice.

One more question: If the bus pulls to one side when I apply the brakes, and
the diagnosis is a restricted flexible brake hose, should I put the new hose
on the side to which the bus pulls, or the other side? (Don't tell me I
should replace both -- I already know that but the store didn't have two.)
