Subject: CV joints on VW Bus: changing the allen key 
  nuts????????????????????????

Sometimes the heads of these screws get gummed up then someone even using
the correct tool can strip the threads unless they make sure they clean out
the threads first.

As a side note, I didn't have the time to rebuild my CV axles this time so I
ordered the whole thing already done.  Guess what...When you buy the kit,
you get new screws,grease and the joint.  When you buy the whole axle. You
get the axle with a cv joint and a boot on each end. No bolts, no grease...
Just something to keep in mind.

So anyone know a good substitute for the grease (something available from
Advance) and an easy way to inject once the boot is already on???

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
