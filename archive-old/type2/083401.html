&gt; Much to my chagrin, the brand new (and expensive!) front tires on my '71
&gt; have worn their inside edges down to the flat rubber in less than 3,000

&gt; slightly to the right ever since I bought it and the steering wheel has been
&gt; a little off center.
&gt;
&gt; Having owned motorcycles and understanding the gyroscopic effects of a
&gt; turning wheel, I surmised the front end was toed out instead of in (which
&gt; would cause the tires to &quot;lean&quot; inward and wear the inside edges). I
&gt; measured yesterday and they were in fact toed out about 3/4&quot;. I've corrected
&gt; it as best I can and I think they're now about right (0-1/8&quot; toed in), but
&gt; the bus still pulls right, perhaps even a little stronger now. The notches
&gt; on the camber adjustors point forward, as they should, and they *look*
&gt; right, but I'm starting to wonder if the camber is wrong. Incidentally, the
&gt; steering is now a bit more off-center.

Wow!  With 3/4 inch of toe-out I'd expect some really wierd handling!

the camber adjusters don't always point straight forward.  They are there
to compensate for the tolerances in the front end parts.

You need to check the camber angle.  You can either have an alignment shop
do this or you can do it yourself if you have a carpenter's level,
patience, and are good at trig.  Check the archives as I think I've given
the complete procedure before.

&gt; Million dollar question: Will re-centering the steering via the drag link
&gt; correct the pull to the right, or is one of my tires off-camber? In other
&gt; words, does the position of the steering worm affect the way a front end
&gt; &quot;pulls&quot;?

No.  The position of the worm only controls the play in the system.  If
the worm is not in the right place there will be too much play as the worm
is tightest in the straight-ahead position.

You need to adjust your camber.
