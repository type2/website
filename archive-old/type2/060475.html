Subject: Re: Spring plate rubber bushings

Let's see if I have edited Barry's quote short enough and written my
responses long enough to get by the automatic reply kicker-outer's
bias against replies shorter than the quoted basis for them.  Like all
automated processes, I think this one forces me to use more space  in
replying than I otherwise would, or forces me to look up the magic
disconnector symbol (was it a semicolon?) which I have stored in a
file somewhere, but don't want to take 15 minutes to search for
;;;.

My opinion:  Believe Bentley.  I dunno why graphite is slicker than
talc in a rubber-metal interface but if VW - via Bentley - sez it is
then it probably is.

My opinion: mineral oil is, I think, petroleum based.  Vegetable oils
will likely dry into a varnish-like goop.  It isn't hard to do it the
way Bentley tells us to, and you won't have to do it again unless you
really like to play with rear suspension height, so why not just do it
Bentley's way and get it over with?

My opinion:  no to both questions.  But there isn't any reason I can
see why you shouldn't inspect and renew the donuts before you start
adjusting things.  That way you won't have to haul the spring plate
off (being careful to mark exactly how it aligns with the torsion bar
or else you will be back to square one), and take out the donut and
renew it.)  And when you are happy with the angle, just slap on the
outer donut and cover and bolt things up.
