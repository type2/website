Subject: Cost of Owning a Bus

Ive been watching and thinking as this thread unravels and...
Even at 5000$ and maybe anothe 500-1000 annually for maintaining there
arent many other vehicles cheaper to operate.
Any 20-30 (or even 40-50) YO vehicle is not going to be as reliable as a
brend new one but I still see new cars broken down all the time on the
side of the xway so nothing is foolproof.
Look around at the cars on the road? How many are as old as your bus? It
says quite a bit about the design that we have these out there.
I like not being in the disposable car loop.
I love the feeling of busses and if I look at the cars on the road there
are few which I see myself driving happily down the road.
And (to paraphrase the beer commercial) 'I love you guys' weep weep
