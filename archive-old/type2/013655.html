Hello Rick:

I just installed a new engine in my 83 Westfalia.
I salvaged an oil temperature gauge and sending unit from an 87 Audi GT
Coupe and installed it in my type IV engine.
The sending unit goes right into the same hole as the plug for the oil
preasure relief valve (requires some copper washers as spacers to
maintain the proper length and not change the loading on the oil
presasure relief valve).
The engine has no airflow to speak of at this mounting location and the
aluminum/magnesium type IV block transfers heat better than the cast iron
Audi engine; I assume that this reading could be incorrect to some
extent. (the Audi fan cools the mounting location on the Audi vehicle and
its located adjacent to the water pump).
So actually I'm reading engine block temperature at this location as well
as oil temperature.
I'm getting a reading of 130 Celsius at 65 MPH and 140 Celsius at 70-75
MPH with an outside air temp of 90-95.
I'm getting a reading of 130 Celsius at normal driving around town at
normal driving speeds (takes about 15 minutes to reach this temp and a
similar period to cool down).
*Degrees Farenheight.
Using the formula below:
To convert Celsius temperatures into Fahrenheit:
Begin by multiplying the Celsius temperature by 9. 
Divide the answer by 5. 
Now add 32.* 
The Audi Gauge is marked in Celsius and I'm feeling that 266 Farenheit is
getting pretty hot (this is the first bar marker on the Audi Gauge and I
assume that the Audi being water cooled would run safley at this temp.)
I'm running 20/50 Oil and proper timing of 7.5 BTC, valve settings of 1
turn in.
Since the engine has only 1200 Miles on it I'm hoping that this
temperature at highway speeds may come down some in the future.
I've never used an oil temperature gauge before and so far it has just
been a parinoid monitoring incumberance.
I've heard others mention that the sending unit mounted in the Oil Drain
plug location is in-accurate because of air flow past the sender; I can't
but wonder if I'm not in the reverse with little or no airflow at the Oil
Preasure Relief valve location.
After all this rambling I'm just looking for some comfort running at
these temperatures.
I question the resistance of a poor ground but my oil presure gauge works
good and I've checked it for accuracy with a mechanical gauge 10 inches
from the preasure port.
So the question is; How hot is too hot?

&gt; Jeff, if your engine has been around a bit, I would suggest running a 
&gt; 20W-50
&gt; weight oil.  With the hotter outside temps, the engine runs hotter 
&gt; to.  The
&gt; heavier weight will stick in your bearings that much longer after
