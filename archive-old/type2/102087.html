Subject: Vacuum lines unclear

I have searched the archives and haven't found an
actual description of the vacuum lines for a '76
2liter bus. Most of the posts that I found were just
references to look back at the archives, so I did and
still need help. If someone has a diagram, that would
do it. Otherwise I will go ahead and describe the
hoses that I need help with. OK, Here it goes:

-The two hoses from the distributor advance canister.

- The hose from the EGR valve.

-There is a hose coming off of the vacuum pipe that
connects to the brake assist upfront, it is located
just forward of the firewall tin and forward of a
one-way valve- (I believe that's what it is) in the
line. 

These are all smaller diameter (3.5mm?) hoses and
fittings.

I have one more piece that I'm not sure of; it is a
cast piece, part #022131519, it is about 1-1/4&quot; long
and about 5/8&quot; diameter, it has a 1/2&quot; long M8 stud
protruding from the bottom and two small vacuum
nipples on the top (one on each end).

Please help me find a home for them if you can. If you
have some specific info for me, Please send it to:

Thanks!
