Subject: Westy - How Do I Know?

Sounds as if you have a &quot;Riviera&quot; camper conversion, given the fact that
your poptop goes straight up. If it has yellow vinyl-like poptop canvas
material rather than actual canvas, that is another giveaway. The Rivieras
differ from the Westfalias in that respect (Westy tops are the slanted
type) as well as the interior components and layout.  Rivieras were
converted from standard buses (I believe) in the US, while Westys came that
way from Germany.  I also think that Westys have metallic labels in certain
places inside that actually say &quot;Westfalia&quot; or something to that effect on
them. As far as &quot;Type 4&quot; is concerned, I think that refers to the type of
engine that is in the late-model Type2 buses, rather than an actual bus
type.
