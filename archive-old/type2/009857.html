&gt;4. Run engine for 5-10 miles doing the drive up to 55; then wind
&gt;(down-shift) do wn to 20 mph...at least 5 times...as many as 10. 

Joe,

I know this sounds like the dumbest question of all time. But where do 
you do this? What conditions? The only thing I can think of is to get on 
and off the freeway about 10 ten times. But that would require a lot of 
idling in between each set. Don't say &quot;country road;&quot; by the time I would 
get the bus to a country road, it would already be broken in.
