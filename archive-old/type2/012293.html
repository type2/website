&gt; I've photographed and posted a copy of the original invoice for the

Hey there Teri,

Thanks !! That's exactly what I was looking for. BTW, the P27 option
for 3035.00 is for the *deluxe* package. The P22 is the standard
camper mcode, which your bus doesn't have.

If this is the original invoice for your 79, then you have the deluxe
campmobile. (it has a stove, right?).

This is the same color/interior as my bus. See pics of my 79 at:

http://www.geocities_dot_com/grnmnstr/vw/mybuspics.html

Also this confirms some of my m-codes (from my mcode plate), which
are listed at the bottom of my page. 

It looks like you have a 79 which left the factory on June 19th (July
4th delivery), but I'm confused (not really) about the UT code (same
as my 79).

The invoice says Amsterdam [(Ben) Pon S automobiehandel], but it
looks like both our buses were finally delivered to LA or Pomoma, CA.
This makes sense to me as my bus is originally from out west
(oregon).

If anyone is interested in figuring out their m-codes, check out
Vincent's website at: http://www.type2_dot_com/m-codes/

Thanks so much for the info, it has answered some questions I had
about my bus.
