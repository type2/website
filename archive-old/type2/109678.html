&gt; is it reasonable to assume that the lower end is in decent shape?

No. It's a GEX engine. The kid who assembled it
wouldn't make that assumption. Why would you?

&gt; i have heard that 2.0L lower ends are virtually indestructable so maybe
GEX
&gt; couldnt have screwed up the lower end too bad or maybe they didnt rebuild
&gt; the lower end at all.

The problem is your bottom-feeder engine builder
has a history of purchasing rejected parts in large
quantities. Parts suppliers offer these deals to
reduce overstocks of junk and Gex scoops them up.
Then these mismatched pistons and cylinders,
connecting rods, rebuilt heads, etc. are combined
into sets for your engine. Specifications will be found
beyond the acceptable limits, and despite the fact
your engine produces some power, it won't have the
expected service life you would like.
You've already experience one failure.
Was it convenient ?  How many miles are on that
new engine ? ( &quot;Do you feel lucky ?&quot; :)

&gt; basically what it comes down to is the fact that im pretty broke and very
&gt; new to working on volks.

Uh-oh. Time for a reminder. Your previous statement-
&quot; this is my first vw so i want to fix things right the first time.&quot;
&quot;i would like to get it on the road as soon as possible but dont
 want be forced to drop the motor again in another 5,000 miles &quot;.

&gt; i feel capeable enough to replace the heads, but
&gt; a bottom end rebuild seem way out of my league. could removing the heads,
&gt; taking them to a mcachinest to get checked out, and replacing what i need
&gt; to be an adequate solution to my problem. i bought this bus almost a year
&gt; ago and it has yet to see the open road. thanks in advance.

There are no extra or unnecessary parts in the bottom end,
nor anywhere in this engine. ( You display a remarkable optimism :)
So far, the damage is limited to a gasket and your time.
There is a cheap way out, and it will produce a learning curve.

Camping adds weight to an already stressed bus engine.
And it's a lot smaller than your pile of camping gear :)
