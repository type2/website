Okay, I'm not crazy, it's just tempermental. Thanks to all who responded with experience and advice. I've applied the appropriate solution and will tackle this later today. It's new brakes for Kristy's van today.

Partly sunny, 70ish. No more time for computer with it looking this pretty outside.

Thanks! Joe (Memphis, TN)

&gt;Hmmm...am I missing something here? To remove the cooling fan, I simply remove those 3 bolts and the one in the middle, right? BTW, never saw reference to that bolt in the middle in my books...but it was there, so I removed it...right in the center of the fan at the back of the crankshaft.
&gt;
&gt;Because of the way my engine is mounted on the stand, the flywheel is essentially locked. I've removed these 4 bolts from the fan side, but the hummer doesn't seem to want to come off. I'm not anxious to pound too much in either direction, as I don't want to mess with the crankshaft bearings or case face by hammering.
&gt;
&gt;ideas?
