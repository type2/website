&gt; How easy would it be to install the engine out of a 72

&gt; thought i'd ask since my bus needs and engine and
&gt; nobody seems to want to buy my $500 411.

I put a 71 411 engine in my 1978 with auto tranny as a temp engine while I
rebuilt my 2 liter.    needed to use the 78 fuel injection but otherwise
fit right in.
