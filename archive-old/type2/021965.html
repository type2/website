Subject: Is type2_dot_com mailing list even legal? Can my &quot;10 year list digest
	&quot; server go online?

Ken,

Since you seem so intent on protecting us and not allowing things to be
shared if they MIGHT do something you don't like... I have some questions
I've always wondered about.

Without seeking permission from me... So if you FORWARD one of my emails to
the list that you have in your inbox?  What if it is a message I wrote 3
years ago and I'm no longer alive?
A quoted reply, especially if you accidentally change or drop a key word? Or
edit out sections with &quot;snip&quot;.
A single message being on an archive screen vs a streaming list of
pre-compressed ZIP file being on a screeN? One is an archive, but one is
not?

Oh my god, are Mailing Lists even legal?  They take a message and send it to
an UNKNOWN SECRET LIST of people... is it really legal to send people your
message?

What about when someone posts &quot;Oops, i didn't mean to send that to the list,
please ignore that&quot; -- is the list server obligated to recall all the
messages?

New Way to solve the problem - 10 year digest
====================================================
If the list server were changed to send a &quot;10 year digest&quot; of past posts as
an option to new people subscribing, would this be OK?  My server can be the
new &quot;super digest server&quot; if you approve!

About the only real issue here is that Bob Hoover asked Type2_dot_com to remove
a ORGANIZED and INDEXED web site, he never said anything about the Type2
archives.  And even then, he is one person, a good faith attempt can be made
to remove his messages.  We haven't even contact Bob Hoover about

  Stephen

&gt; Based on what you said, I don't see how the archives itself is not a
&gt; republishing of the messages.  The way I see it is that when I post a
&gt; message, it is published to every subscriber.  If they retrieve it again
via
&gt; the archives, they are having that message republished to them.

There is no case law on searchable list archives to my (limited) knowledge.

I'm comfortable with an archive that people can run searches into, in the
conventional internet sense of &quot;searches&quot;. Possibly even that will be held
to violate copyright law eventually, as intellectual property law becomes
increasingly surreal, but we can say these things about it at least:

--you knew about it when you subscribed

--it does not contradict any established intellectual copyright precedent

--not one single person, out of thousands of subscribers, has ever objected
to it even once

--thousands, possibly millions of internet fora do the same thing, and have
for a long time.

Given the awesome utility value of a searchable archive to the bus
community, then, I'm willing to take the small risk of serving it (I'm not
the only voice and if another admin objects, this can change).

A CD, though, clearly constitutes publishing, and we aren't going to do
that.

-Hoop
