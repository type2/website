        Sez Craig:
&gt;Up to four Asstonites, huh... Hi Eddie! If the other two O' you let
&gt;yerselves be known,
&gt;perhaps festivities could be planned... day trips, labor sharing, BS

        David Goldberg was one of them, but this was several months back on
the Vanagon list before the split. Haven't seen any posts lately so he may
not be here anymore. I do believe we had about 9 last year.
        I've long considered a TCC trip (Texas Camping Crazies), but I'm
always working. I have hopes that someday I may have a weekend off...

Peace,
