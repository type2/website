&gt;Subject: Bus in Commercial
&gt;Just sitting back watching TV and noticed a B&amp;W picture of an early bus 
&gt;in the new Cadillac (sp?) commercial.  Anyone else see it?

        Yeah, I saw that the other day, but forgot to post about it.  Seems
like  there are ads everywhere with buses.  The new National Geographic
(November '96, page 136) has a green and white '68-'71 vintage bus in a GTE
ad.  If you look closely under the front bumper, you can see some wires
dangling and even a few small rust spots here and there.  How about that?
They used a real bus for the photo instead of some museum quality mint
condition one.
