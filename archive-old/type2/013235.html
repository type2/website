You are Invited!

All plans are GO for the Full Moon in Joon (in May) Memorial Day weekend
campout. http://members.home_dot_net/fullmooninjoon/index.htm (Dialup? saves
time&gt; http://members.home_dot_net/fullmooninjoon/FMIJ2001.htm )

For meals this year we will be having Breakfast Burritos one morning or
another. Maybe we will make a better show of it than Everybus2001 8^)' For
Supper on Saturday evening we will be having, back by popular demand (and
the availability of the 'Colossal Cast Iron Cooker'), the second annual
Spaghetti Dinner. Bring your Noodles. I will be making a webpage this
weekend with the needed supplies and kind suppliers, so if you want your own
obscure piece of internet fame, send us an email with your contributions.
Anyone who has yet to attend a campout, you don't know what you've missed
with the group meals. They are ALWAYS fantastic, better than a picnic dinner
at your Grandmothers church, and you can drink beer to boot!

The location this year is www_dot_deerfields_dot_com located 20 minutes in a
southerly direction from Asheville. The fine gentlemen who operate this
private mountain oasis have invited us to their property not only for this
year, but in years to come. They really want to make friends with us, so we
should extend to them some sincere hospitality. They especially want to
witness the ritual case burning. We already have one case arranged, but more
are welcome. We'll just have to keep Diesel Joe away from the water
balloons! (Man. I bet his valves are really_well_lubricated.)

There will be awards this year. The categories will be randomly chosen by an
amorphous group of loosely monikered 'Judges', and the trophies will be
awarded with complete subjectivity. We figure that if no-one knows what they
might receive a whimsical (and potentially embarrassing) award for, it will
keep everyone on their toes. This Year's MC will be the Honorable Mad Uncle
Dave, who, under extreme duress, has caved in and accepted the duty. Unless
he doesn't show up.

Several people have made inquiries about the event:

Is there a dress code?

I have to admit that this question, posed by a fellow Full Moon Bus Club
couple at EB2001, left me momentarily stunned and confused. How do I answer?
Is it a joke? Do they want to run around Nekkid? They seem like normal
people....

Do I have to be a Member to go?

Well, no. But by going you do subject yourself to Membership. In fact,
merely by sending an email you could technically be considered a Member. I
have to check with the ad-hoc membership committee (if I could figure out
who they are, they have a mysterious webpage at
http://www.geocities_dot_com/Baja/Ravine/2474/enrollment.html ) to get a reading
on the particular fine points of this aspect of member law. In any case, if
you find yourself in the unwitting position of being an unindicted
co-conspiritor you can repudiate membership at any time by simply howling at
the (full) moon three times in rapid succession.

Do I pay at the gate??

Yes. For this particular event you will have to pay the private property
owners a small tribute of $20.00 USD per adult to enter and they will issue
you corresponding wristbands. Amortized over the three possible camping
nights this is a relative bargain at $13.34 a night (rate based on double
occupancy). However, since this is private property and we will be the only
group on the property we will have a certain amount of ... privacy. This was
sorely lacking last year at the National Park campground where the event was
held.

No reservations?

There are no reservations as we will be in field and orchard and there are
no assigned spots. You can camp by yourself or with a group of friends or
with a group of people that you haven't made friends with yet... it's your
choice.
