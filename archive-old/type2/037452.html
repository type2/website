Yow!  if you do this be _sure_ that you wear good eye protection.  I mean
full splashproof goggles like those stylish ones you wore in High School
chemistry!  Also be careful of unexpected chemical interactions.  I'd hate
to think of what would happen if someone decided to follow up the Drano
with some acid!  Drano is nasty stuff! From the time you get some of it in
your eye, you have 5-seconds to wash it out before serious damage is done.
After 20 seconds, get used to seeing without that eye.
