Subject: Re: [T2] Final question: align bore?

Well, if the case needs to be align-bored then you should do it, and if it
doesn't, then don't!

When I did my Type IV rebuilds a few years ago I took the cases up to AVP in
Sacramento.  Talked with Leonard for a couple of hours and his advice was to
align-bore Type IV cases because of their age.  There's specific
measurements you can make to the holes that receive the bearings and perhaps
you should go this route as it shouldn't cost too much and would help you
make the decision.  Leonard's quick and dirty test was to take a new #3
bearing and push it hard into each half circle on each case.  It should then
&quot;pop&quot; out when pulled; if not the case is worn and won't give the necessary
&quot;crush&quot; to the bearings when assembled.

I don't think there's any issue about weakening the case when align-boring
it for the first time.  The issue is whether the case will give the proper
crush to the bearings, which gives the proper final dimension to the
bearing/crank interface, which give the proper oil pressure.

Subject: [T2] Final question: align bore?


&gt; Once more, the question is whether to have the aluminum case from a
&gt; 2.0L align bored. I would like to get maybe 30,000-50,000 miles out of
&gt; this engine. After that, I am going to pull out all the stops and have
&gt; B. Bob build me an engine.
&gt;
&gt; If I could drive the case across town, I'd just do it. But I have to
&gt; ship it across the country and then have it shipped back.
&gt;
&gt; So what's the consensus? Bore, or no bore?
