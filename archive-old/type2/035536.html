Subject: Re: Westy sink/icebox unit questions

Shawn,


There are several versions of the icebox/sink in
question, but maybe I can be of help on some of your
questions.....

Read on.....

You said...
&gt; turns out I'm missing
&gt; several things:
&gt; 
&gt; Water fill tube and cap for water tank.

This is an easy one....you can get a replacement from
Bus Boys for around $14.95 (that's what I paid around
2 years ago, anyway). It's a light gray color, as
opposed to the original white, but it works perfectly
and installs in about 30 seconds, assuming the old one
is entirely removed :-)

&gt; 
&gt; Drawer under sink (so Bently says..I've never seen
&gt; one)

Yes, my '69 Westy has one. Not all do. It's a very
narrow (about 4 inches wide) drawer that is located in
the dead space between the sink and the side of the
cabinet closest to the slider.... I don't know if that
makes sense or not, but it's the only way I can
explain it! 

Also, my sink does *not* have a drain, as some seem
to... mine has a stainless-steel basin that you remove
and empty manually. I *think* other versions had a
bigger basin, with a built-in drain that took up the
&quot;dead&quot; space my drawer sits in... Some versions even
had a vent-tube running from the icebox unit to the
poptop area, but I've never actually seen one and
don't know what is hooked up to what, but I imagine
that it would, again, take up the space the drawer
occupies 8-/


&gt; 
&gt; Ice drain tray (never seen one of these either).

Yep, I've got one. These are getting to be
increasingly rare, from what I understand. Mine is a
bit cracked/worn, but still intact. I didn't even know
these things existed until I bought my latest bus...
 
&gt; Also, the hinges on the workspace table (the one
&gt; that flips over the
&gt; sink) seem to be bent.  It wont lie flat either way.
&gt;  Does this rest on
&gt; something?   

Mine will not rest &quot;flat&quot; over the sink because the
table itself lies on top of the stainless basin. It's
close to flat, but not quite. 

Also, there is a support made of heavy-guage,
chrome-plated wire that supports the &quot;table&quot; while in
use....  The support is triangular in shape, and is
attached to the icebox/sink cabinet via clamps that
allow it to swing out to support the table, as well as
to lay flat against the cabinet for easy passage
between the cabinet and the rear-facing seat when the
&quot;table&quot; is in the &quot;down&quot;, or unused, position
(assuming that you have a walkthrough bus...).


.....I know my description probably doesn't translate
well, so I've done my best to create a diagram, using
ASCII....(be gentle, this is one of my first tries at
this;-)

This is what my cabinet/table/support looks like when
viewed from the rear seat (or z-bed, in my case)...


     &quot;Table&quot;         Sink/Icebox cabinet top...

I hope this helps...........

&gt;Does anyone have pictures of the above
&gt; drawer and ice
&gt; tray.  I could probably fashion something.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I have a bookmark for a Westy owner's manual on the
&gt; web somewhere, but
&gt; it's at work. Anyone have the URL?

I have a semi-complete '69 Westy manual (the original
for my bus), but it doesn't cover the above, except in
*very* vague generalities.... Still, I guess I should
put it on my web-page...
