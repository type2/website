Subject: Brosol 30/31vs Solex 34 Thanks!

I would like to thank again those individuals who took the time to respond 
to my initial question. Your answers provided insight to the subtle operational differences between the two carburetor installations which I would have not appreciated just by looking at the specs. From your responses, it appears that either carburetor setup has it's pros and cons like the vehicles and drivers that use them.

Hello List,

I would be interested in hearing from anyone who was using a Solex Pict 34 -3
on a 1600 DP and downsized to a Brosol 30/31 -3 using their adapter flange. 
I was wondering if you experienced any impacts on performance , gas mileage or unplanned mechanical issues after the downsizing. 

Thanks for your help,

Joe Delecki
