&gt; I've asked these questions before but did not yet get an answer that
&gt; will
&gt; put my curiosity to rest:
&gt; 
&gt; Q1. What determines the optimal offset from an engineering point of
&gt; view?

The offset is determined by the steering geometry (it's nice to have
the steering axis somewhere near the center of the tread), the bearing
loading (should be balanced between the bearings) and the physical
parameters of the wheel well.

&gt; Q2. How much of a deviation from that optimum can be considered
&gt; acceptable?

This depends upon the application.  Show cars and &quot;low riders&quot; use
really outrageous positive offsets and put up with evil handling to get
the right look.  Practically, I don't think that you will notice a
difference of 5mm in offset in handling or tire wear.

&gt; Q3. Why did VW change the offset when they put 6&quot; alloys on their
&gt; Vanagon?

No idea.  Might have been looks, availability, a desirable design
change, or simply an oversight.

What _I'd_ like to find are a set of 15 inch _steel_ wheels with the
correct offset.

Of course, for the monied among us, you can always get modular wheels
in any offset you please.  See:
