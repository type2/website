Subject: Re: [T2] Going back to dual Solex's

&gt;Dual Kadron's are excellent carbs. Look for a used set on www.thesamba_dot_com
&gt;or other VW trade boards. These carbs are just 40mm versions of original
&gt;solexes made in Brazil. I have used these carbs since the mid 70's and can
&gt;say nothing but good things about them. In fact, I would take those carbs
&gt;over the original factory setup any day.

Well I think you will find some replies to this post not so positive.
I too am running dual kadrons. They do work, but I find them picky, hard to 
tune, and just plain disagreeable on some days.....

Here are my musings on these carbs:
1. They dont work with a standard flow meter, making them hard to sync.
2. The older ones with the metal floats need to be upgraded to the plastic 
floats.
3. The linkage is just plain crap.
4. They run rich, or are hard starting, take your pick.


On the other hand, they do work well when set up right. I liked the article 
in one of the VW magazines (are they paying royalties?) that had a &quot;wizard&quot; 
be able to sqeeze so much performance out of one.
When I stomp the accelerator on my bus, a 1970 sundowner westy with a 1776, 
the speedo needle moves, and the bus means business. I do know the 
difference, I had a stock exhaust with a pict 31 when I got it and moved to 
a free flow with the duals and the engine came to life.

But I have seen an engine go from dual kadrons to dual webbers with a better 
linkage just shine.

SO:
Dual kadrons, OK, its a bit of work and maintanence. Go to Dual webbers and 
its a whole new ballgame. They get set, the linkage is tough, and away you 
go.
