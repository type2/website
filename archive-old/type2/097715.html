Subject: Tranny Problem

Yesterday I joined the List. I also bought a 1968 single cab. Today, I jacked 
it up and pulled the engine which was blown. I could tell it was blown by the 
large hole in the case in front of the fuel pump. This is most likely the 
85th engine my husband and I have pulled. 
       Today, the main shaft of the transmission came out with the engine. 
The main shaft was replace very easily and spun the trans axle properly. 
Should I expect any problems from this event? Should I replace the seal? The 
seal looks fine. This has never happened to me before and just thought 
someone might have some info about it.
       Thank you for any assistance offered.
