Subject: Re: [T2] hard spare tire cover

From: &quot;bpierce&quot; &lt;bpierce_at_shaka_dot_com&gt;
&gt; Does anyone know where one of these hard covers can be purchased?

My `77 has one of those, though one of the metal, twist hold downs is broken
off in the bus.

I'm sure that someone here will know where to pick one up.
