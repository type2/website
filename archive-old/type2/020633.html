Subject: idling problem 77 bus

Hi all. I got a chance this weekend to play wit it, nothing
changed if I plugged the brake vaccum line right at the
intake.. So then checked the boots, manifold ends etc, and
found everything tight. not for sure, but looks like someone
may have only put one new head on not too long ago. maybe
thats the prob? i'm gonna do a compression check again to
double check, but before it was fine. the solenoid is tight
and valves are right on. ??? going nuts! by the way the 1600
dp conversion was a good choice as far as i'm concerned,
moves along pretty good in phoenix traffic. and the rear
hanger issue was a cinch, just used the original bar and
mounted a bent/fabbed mount to the bug case oil-pump. any
help with my idling prob is greatly appreciated!! thanks!
-mark b.
