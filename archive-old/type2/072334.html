The idea is that two additional levers are attached on either side of 
the main hand break one, cut off and covered in cycle handles.
The two new outer levers are then attached via a bike chain and a 
piece of metal that sits under the adjustment screw to to each 
braking cable separately.
If you then pull the handbreake as normal both cables will be tighten 
as normal.
If you are stuck and lets say your right wheel is spinning you can 
pull the right leaver which will only pull the right braking cable by 
the adjustment screw, this slowing down the right wheel and making 
the left wheel turn.
Nifty he?
A lot of new cars use the ABS system in a similar way to prevent 
slippage, so it should work.

If this is not clear look at the diagram again or even better have a 
look at your hand breake setup and you will see how you can 
selectively breake one wheel at a time!
