(The topic suggest that I indeed can speak like the Reverend Jesse Jackson.)

Anyway...

Boy and girls...I think this horse might be beaten to a bloody pulp at this
point.  Some sing praises, others toss stones...

I think the one conclusion we can reach is that everyone has an &quot;opinion&quot;
and an &quot;asshole&quot;, which is what makes us thinking human beings that defecate
and drive VW buses.

Hopefully in the end we will not go crazy, or get hemorrhoids from the
spewing that is done by either end.  Nor will we drop a valve in all of the
processes.

What we need to do to ensure &quot;evil plight&quot; does not come upon us from the
top or the bottom is...keep our minds clear, always have Charmin, and eat
lot's of ruffage.  Also...we must allow our engines to warm up each morning
before we head out.

Let's allow ourselves at this point to take a laxative, change our oil, and
swallow that last Prozac for the good of common man and members of this
list.  The biggest portion of are having lower intestinal difficulties
brought on by this on going smatter/patter/worrysome compression level
thread.

Just imagine the statue &quot;The Thinker&quot;.  Place him on a toilet and you will
see a mental image of who is posting this.  These are the special things in
life.  : )

Have a groovy day folks and may you find much happiness in your bus and the
mornings meeting with the porcelain for all of us do agree that both are
important in the operations of our daily lives.  Don't forget to take
something to read with you to the throne room.

Thanks for tolerating the ramblings,
Charlie Ford
