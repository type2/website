&gt; &gt; ...that is the question. I set my 74 1800, dual carbs, stock, to 10* ATDC static as suggested in Muir &amp; Bentley. Now it runs terribly! It had been previously set to 4* BTDC and ran well, with the exception of the low idle miasma I'm puzzling through.

&gt;           Uhhh, no, the manual certainly didn't tell you to set it at 10 ATDC static. 

Well, yes and no. Bentley, in the front matter, empahsizes the need to use a timing light. Muir, on the other hand, rants against timing lights. Muir's chart shows 10 ATDC &amp; as far as I could tell that was static. Perhaps a VW is not a Macintosh where a person can get away without reading &amp; re-reading and thinking through the manual...

Thanks.
