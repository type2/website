Everything is ok although I could use a better engine hatch seal.  Mine's not cracked yet but it could be sealing better. I say it's ok because the smell isn't exhaust instead is a burned smell, like paper or some material.

I was waiting to repaint the bus but I may replace the seal sooner.  I'm going to use the heat with the windows downa and see if it goes away over time because I haven't used the heating system for 5 years.

Changing the subject here a little, there is a lot of air coming in through the front air vent even with the blue lever all the way up.  Do I just need to adjust the lever or has a seal deteriorated?
