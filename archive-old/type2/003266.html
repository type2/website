Subject: Re: [T2] Re hydraulic lifter adjustments

[....]

&gt; I disapprove of allowing any play between the hydraulic lifter piston
&gt; and the pushrod tube, since you are then allowing slapping of the piston
&gt; against the snapring,

The pushrod rests in the cup of the lifter, and is not &quot;slapping&quot; at .006

and also the valve will not lift as high as it
&gt; should.

True, but Boston Bob does not say LEAVE it at .006.....he is just having it
set at .006 to lower the stress on the valve drain and lifter......sort of
like priming a pump.....hot oil is flowing into the lifter, and every now
and then the push rod presseds the lifter, expelling air gradually but
surely.

  If oil pressure affects the lifter as it was designed for, it
&gt; will function properly whether you have 1/8 turn beyond contact or 2 1/2
&gt; turns.


True, but if you watch your valve train work as you are giving the preload,
you can tell that this in effect is holding your valves open, until enough
oil is pushed out of the lifter to achieve zero clearance.

 Assuming the piston has 2mm of free play before it hits the
&gt; snapring or bottoms out, its ideal position is in the center of its free
&gt; play. (or 2 180 degree turns).  The purpose of those advocating less
&gt; turning in is the assumption that valve lash will decrease over time as
&gt; observed in bug engines (due to seat/valve wear, loosening of case nuts,
&gt; &quot;stretching&quot; of a hot case).  Starting small allows for a longer &quot;safe&quot;
&gt; period before the piston might bottom out and cause a &quot;solid&quot; lifter to
&gt; not let the valve close completely.
&gt;     Me, I adjust the lifters about every 25,000 mi to check if anything
&gt; has changed drastically- ie, if it takers 3 turns to begin clearance,
&gt; something is affecting the valve, such as it stretching, or the seat is
&gt; deepening.

By setting the lifters as close to zero as possible, the drive train tension
is minimilized, and I am certain that over the course of time will lead to
longer life of the lifters.


People have been doing it the Bentley way for years..........that is why
Boston Bob's recommendations are to be printed in the next printing of the
Bentley......................no small task to get done...........and also,
Boston Bob has built more of these things that probably the whole list
combined...........he will always get the benefit of my doubt!!!
