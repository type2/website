&gt; I then checked the entire wireharness and AFM as per the Bentley
&gt; manual with no faults found...the only exception was I didn't check
&gt; the fuel regulator because the van runs fine once warm and has no
&gt; problem starting.

It's kind of a long-shot and, at a *guess*, it's not relevant to your
problem, but I'd still check the fuel pressure.  Go down to your local Ace
Hardware and get a water pressure gauge that reads up to 45 lbs.  Get a
brass hose barb that screws on to the gauge with a 1/4&quot; barb.  Get a length
of FI hose and a couple of hose clamps.  For $15 - $20 you're in business
and can ensure that fuel pressure *isn't* the problem.  It's one of those
&quot;tools&quot; you use once every year or two and the price is right.

&gt; What I'm wondering is that now that I may have fixed a few problems
&gt; that were real problems could the timing or dwell be off again?

The dwell shouldn't be affected since dwell is just the measure of the
time - expressed in degrees - that the points are open (or closed - I don't
remember 'cause I've run pointless distributors for so long) and shouldn't
be affected by anything except the gap of the points.  The timings shouldn't
have changed either, unless the &quot;idle&quot; is now so high that the advance
mechanism on the distributor is affecting things.
