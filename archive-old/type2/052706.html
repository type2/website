Subject: [T2] Is today Friday?  Apples/Oranges  (Hoover/Archive)

Funny how you can get practically banished from the list if you talk about
something other than VW busses on any day but Friday but this tirade goes on
and on.  Bring back the busses and the bus talk.  Pull your head out and put
up the archives.  Unless you want to read the same questions over and over.
(like we don't already)  This is the greatest thing that has happened to my
bus/VW hobby as it makes the guy with the knowledge right next door.  Now we
have stepped back 10 years to just manuals and a friendly mechanic.
&gt;&gt;  Bus Content
Got a military issue gas heater 6v Stewart Warner Model # 978-M
Anybody know any info on it.  The guy that sold it to me said to get hold of
the National Guard at it was theirs and is NOS.  Email for pics if you need
um.

Get back in the bus and bring us back to the year 2001!!!
Still have HOPE!!!!????
