**************************************

Last year I was presented with a similar problem on a Late 76 Riviera
Camper that belongs to my best bud, Cliff.  The original distributor was
basically worn out, mechanically advancing too quick.  The springs and
weights were bad and while we could get it to idle OK, it just would not
&quot;gently&quot; advance through the power curve like it's supposed to do.  We
tried a brand new 009 with mixed (and essentially unsatisfactory) results.

One of the biggest hassles the 009 presents, especially to FI models is
without the vacuum assist, the engine more often than not hesitates.  When
we tried the 009, we found that no matter where we would time the blasted
thing, it would still hesitate off the line.  When the 009 was timed at 7.5
BTDC (Which is what the stock late 76-78 [Single Vac] distributor is with
the vacuum hoses connected), it wouldn't idle very well and so we
incremently advanced it to about 10BTDC and the idle seemed fine, but at
3200rpm it would still hesitate and then ping (detonate) like crazy.
Detonation is not good for air cooled engines.

So a few days later, I provided a rebuilt unit and voila (or is it viola?)
- it ran perfectly (Cliff said it was the best it had run for him in over a
year).  In the meantime, Cliff ordered a brand new distributor (expensive,
but that's what he wanted) and after installation of that one, the results
were the same - advanced perfectly through the power curve.  He keeps the
extra rebuilt unit in his spare parts stash in case something happens when
he's on the road (don't we all?).

The purpose of the vacuum advance is to &quot;assist&quot; in the initial advance
upon take-off and then the mechanical (centrifugal) advance weights take
over from there throughout the powerband.  This is the primary reason why a
vacuum advance distributor is much better in stop and go traffic.  009's a
great if your engine spends 99% of it's life at highway rpms.

HOWEVER - A 009 is fine to keep as a &quot;roadside&quot; spare in your stash to get
you home.
