Subject: Y2K Trip Proposal Report #1
Mime-Version: 1.0

I have had 15 reply to the Y2K Proposal involving a drive from DC to
Newfoundland (aka &quot;The Rock&quot;).

All seemed interested but anyone can figure that if 15 say they will, then
only half that might.  I can definitely understand why.  After i posted the
suggestion up I got rather cold feet as well.  I think I got more
apprehensive simply because I am sort of the designated leader by virtue of
voicing the idea.

Someone suggested that we do the trip in the fall of 1999.  That is not a
bad suggestion at all and would fall right in line with the anniversary of
VW coming to America.  

Another suggested that we depart from Boston simply because of the traffic
of the megalopolis.  

I am still thinking about this trip.  There is much work to be done to
bring it off and to be honest I am not sure I want to be the sole leader of
the expidition.  I coulld do it, but with my life as up in the air as it
is, i would feel much more confident about it happening with a committe to
assist in it's development.
