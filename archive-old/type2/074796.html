&gt; The big giveaway is on the 2L late bays. On transporters VW got rid of the bulkheads behind both seats in 1976(???), but the Westfakiawerkes type2's carry a bulkhead behind the driver through to 1979.

&gt; This is true. My '76 (aug 75) hardtop camper has driver bulkhead, my '79 deluxe does not.

my 78 pass van does not have a bulkhead, just the fillet in the corner
