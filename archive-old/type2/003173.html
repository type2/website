+AD4- Would have pulled this from the archives but it's still down.

+AD4- We are having starting problems after engine has been warmed up, and then
+AD4- shut down. It turns over very slowly. It's a new 1600 dual port with +ACo-just
+AD4- installed+ACo- electronic ignition.
+AD4-
+AD4- Does any one have the instructions for installing the hot start relay?

It sounds like your engine is cranking but very slowly after you shut it down?

This is NOT going to be fixed by the 'no hot start relay' fix. You have
something else wrong. Your starter is dragging. Either your starter is bad or
the bushing is gone or the ground cable to the transaxle is loose/missing or
your timing is too far advanced.
The relay is to fix a NO crank /NO solenoid engagement problem.
