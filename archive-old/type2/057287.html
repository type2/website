Subject: RE: Airflow meter going on '78 Westy?
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

&gt; FLAPS says they can get me a new Bosch airflow meter for (gasp) $320. I
&gt; haven't checked with Ron Salmon yet. I'd guess these things are
&gt; rebuildable in principle. Anyone know what the market for new and rebuilt
&gt; ones is like?


Most of the '75-83 rebuilts run around $139 exchange ($30 core).  Takes one
day to one week to get, depending on whether the rebuilder has one ready to
ship.
