Subject: Re: [T2] '79 bus engine tin needed - hot running

&gt; My bus is running much hotter than before. It gets up to about 250F whereas
&gt; it used to run about 210F with the old engine. I think my cooling flaps are
&gt; stuck due to excess friction and a weak spring, but the flaps appear to be
&gt; stuck in the open position. The wire from the thermostat attaches to a tab
&gt; on the flaps rod. That tab points up (not forward), can someone confirm that
&gt; that is the position for OPEN?

I'm pretty sure that is the correct position, it is design to fail in the
open position
&gt; 
&gt; I removed the dead A/C from the bus during the rebuild, so now I have a big
&gt; hole where the A/C used to be. This is probably the main cause of my hot

I did the same and had the same problem

&gt; engine since the hole is right above the cat converter ('79 CA) bus. Does
&gt; anyone have this missing piece of engine tin (left rear, upper) that they
&gt; can sell to me? 

two things, there is the piece of tin, I needed one for my bus but got two
so I can send you the other. the bigger problem is where thy cut the bus
metal to enlarge that opening, there is supposedly a piece that fits there
but I have never been able to find one so I fabricated a piece and welded
it up, took all of one Sat.  I'm not the best weldor.
