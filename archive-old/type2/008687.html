&gt;does anyone know what years got the early and what years got late?
&gt;fwiw the heater came out of a '72 (located thanks to Mark Hineline) and is
&gt;going into a '70 westy

From what I've determined from the literature, the metering pump/late BN4
was first available on the '72 bus.  However, since the heaters were often
dealer installed it is conceivable that diaphragm pump/early BN4s sitting on
dealer's shelves could've easily been installed in later model buses.   I've
heard from some US list members that their '75-'79 buses (which the manuals
suggest come with the optional BA6 model) had instead dealer installed late
BN4s (which are easier to retrofit than the BA6).  So, according the the
literature, up to '72 was the early BN4, '72-'74 the late BN4, '75-'79 the
BA6--but that's the norm and not an absolute.
