&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I always warm my engine up for at least a minute before I drive off,
especially 
&gt;in the mornings, and then drive it easy for another 3-5 until its warmed up 
&gt;completely. 
&gt;
And I go with Smokey Yunick (RIP) who said &quot;Get it moving, get it hot.&quot;  I
make sure it's really running, do up the seat belt, and start driving VERY
SLOWLY.  If I have to pull out into traffic and speed up to 50 K right
away, yep, I warm it up at about 1200 RPM until the temp guage moves.  But
where I live I can drive for two minutes at 20 K, so that's how I warm it up.
