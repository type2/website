Subject: [T2] Re: [VB] Oil pressure blues

Hey there.
Thanks to all for your replies.  As always, you listees are the absolute 
greatest.  Turns out it's a combination of things.  The sender is indeed 
going bad, I compared oil pressure with a known good mechanical gauge.  When 
the light went on, the gauge read zer0.  Plus, I was almost 3/4 of a quart 
low.  That comes from working those damn half days, _at_work before sunrise and 
leave after dark.  Don't let anyone tell you the military's a good deal.   
It makes a big difference when you check your oil when there's enough light 
to really see what the dipstick sez.  I'll find a sending unit this week, 
for now carry a spare light only unit in case the other dies completely.

Mad UNcle Dave
