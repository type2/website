Subject: Re: Torque wrenches and Pressure Plate

Actually Sue, the 'click' type torque wrench is the least accurate.  In a
former life I worked closely with the metrology depertment of a large
aerospace manufacturer.  We found that, in order of accuracy, the different
types of torque wrenches are as follows (best to worst) 1. beam, 2. analog
dial, 3. digital dial, and lastly, 4. the 'clicker' type.  We used the analog
dial type almost exclusively. (they're easy to calibrate.)  In the rare
circumstance where the clicker type was used, the assembly instructions
required verification with a dial type following the torque application.
(Note: for more information, do a search on 'torque' and see what comes up. 
NIST (Nat'l Institute for Standards and Testing) should have good data, but
you'll probably have to dig for it.)

That being said, Sue DOES have a point though.  Any torque wrench is better
than no torque wrench.  Just have your 'clicker' type calibrated more often.
