&gt; Hey volks,
&gt;
&gt; I have found a camper and was wondering type.  It is a 74 white over blue.
&gt; The poptop goes up like a Riviera.Has a suicide cabinet on passenger side.
&gt; 3/4 width z bed.  Weird upholstery.  Blue and white vinyl.  Late westy
type
&gt; ceiling, that shelf paper over wood, but only in the cargo section.  In
the
&gt; front the ceiling is the vinyl material found in a transporter. Over the z
&gt; bed is a shelf attached to the roof.  Then there is a board that blocks
this
&gt; from being a shelf that has speakers mounted to it facing forward.  The
&gt; passenger side dogleg has a couple id plates like my friends 68 Westy but
&gt; they are illegible.
&gt;
&gt; This is not Westy interior stuff at all.  Similar but not.
&gt; Any ideas??
&gt;

&gt; If you are going to walk on thin ice,
&gt; You may as well dance.
