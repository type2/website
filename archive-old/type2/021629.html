Subject: Re: [vintagebus] Is it possible???

Yes, it's posssible. As long as you have a twelve volt flywheel and
starter bushing you should be able to use it.

Is this a used starter? I wouldn't spend much on an unknown used one. If
there's an Autozone near you, you can get a rebuilt one with a lifetime
warranty for less than $40.00. You can even get the internally supported
starer for that price, so you never have to worry about the starter
bushing again. Tell them to look it up as a 914 Porsche starter. Other
discout type FLAPS might also have a similar deal. I'm just familiar
with the Autozone deal.
