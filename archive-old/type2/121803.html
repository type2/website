Subject: Re: [T2] Late bay Westfalia box info needed

&gt; Does anyone out there know the exact dimensions of the Westfalia box

&gt; they're rare...

Ok, well, I managed to find out, and thought I'd post it for the  
archives.

Someone pointed out to me that Go Westy! sells reproductions of this  
box (and they appear to be very nice reproductions indeed), so I called  
and they were kind enough to give me the info...

For the 75 1/2 - 79 (model years with a swivel passenger seat), outside  
dimensions of the wood:

	11 1/2 in Wide x 13 1/8 in Deep x 14 3/8 in High

and there is about 2 inches of padding and upholstery on the top.

The hinge is at the front of the box, and so the lid swings forward.

Here is a link to the product in Go Westy!'s on-line catalog.
