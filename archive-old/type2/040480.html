Subject: Re: cv joint grease

Hi,

&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; I picked up some CV joint grease at pep boys thats is
&gt; in a green tube with the brand name Sta-lube on it.
&gt; It says 3% moly disulfide on the tube can I use
&gt; this stuff to repack my CV joints?

We just replaced two CV joints in our new bus and repacked the others and
dealt with this exact issue. In the Idiot book, Muir takes about moly
disulfide grease. We actually went to a Pepboys too and saw Moly all over
the place. The first can we bought had moly in it but not the 'moly
disulfide.' It also didn't mention CV joints on the can (just bearings,
etc). So, we bought a more expensive can that had the disulfide in it and
mentioned CV joints on the can. It mentioned that it stood up to high
pressure AND temperature. Maybe this is the important part? This grease is
noticeably thicker than the first less expensive grease we bought. (The
difference between warm pudding and cold cake icing.)

Seems like the tube you got is good (saw it but it was tooo expensive for
too little grease). I think that tube we saw only had about 4 oz in it? I
figured we'd have to buy lots of tubes to pack 4 joints. The Muir book
recommended 14 oz to pack two joints.

By the way, have some plastic eating utensils on hand to help re-pack the
joints. Only problem using a plastic spoon is that after a while you could
swear that the stuff smells like chocolate...
