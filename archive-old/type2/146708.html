Subject: Re: [T2] FI Fuel pump runs. And runs, and runs.

The AFM contact check will not help if the fuel pump is on even with the 
ignition off.   The double relay is really a power relay and a fuel pump 
relay. When the engine is stopped, all current to the FI system should 
be stopped via the power relay in the double relay, although the relay 
itself should still get current from the battery. I suspect something is 
shorted in it and something is not wired right to the fuel pump. . 
Normally, having  someone turn on the ignition while you listen to the 
relay, should cause it to click (power relay) as power from the coil 
terminal 15 is sent to 86c on the relay.
To test relay- pull it off the wall (still connected) in such a way you 
can test the wire terminals under it with a voltmeter probe or a simple 
test lamp.
1.88Z and 88Y should get power at all times from the battery- use 85 as 
the ground side of your curcuit testing.
2. Check terminal 86a- if getting power, the wires to terminal 30 and 50 
on the starter solenoid may be switched. It should be on only when cranking.
3. Turn on ignition- now current from 15 on the coil should power 
terminal 86C on the relay. This power should continue with the starter 
running.
4. With ignition on, test 88b-this feeds the resistance block to the 
injectors. if is not hot, the power relay is bad.
5. Run starter and test 86A -It should now show voltage as it gets 
current from 50 on the starter solenoid.
6. 88D is the fuel pump contact- it should get current only as the 
starter turns.  If your pump runs even with ignition off, see if this is 
getting power then.  Once the starter stops turning, the engine will 
still run if manifold vacuum keeps the AFM vane contact against the 
contact (39) feeding double relay terminal 86b to the pump relay.
  Sometimes a past owner with a bad AFM contact or bad fuel pump relay 
may bypass the pump to come on when the igntion is on, a poor practise 
in case of an accident.
