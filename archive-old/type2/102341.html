Subject: Re: [T2] Need an engine will trade tranny or 2-1700s

Hi John, I dont understand your problem with the 1700
engine, I have built many of them over the years and
all of them seem to get well over 100,000 miles. If
your overhaul procedures are good the 1700 will out
perform the 1600 by 100%, wish I were close enough to
trade you a 1600 (Just rebuilt)(I build Spec Engines,
Spect to sell them.) for the two 1700's. Phil in SC.
