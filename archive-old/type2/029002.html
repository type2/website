James:

Another posted described a slick pro install.  The window string trick was
used, the window went in easily, and when the fella was done, he put a bead
of clear silicone under the lip.  I can do that.
I'm betting he lubed up the window good, if it popped in easily.

Looking back, that's what I'd to different.  Use more lube.

that makes sense the lub and sealant probably would.'t work well together.
sorry i don't remeber what the sealant used was but i wrote it down and
tossed it in my toolbox, unfortunetly im twenty miles away from my toolbox
at the moment. If were you i wouldn't pull the windshield off to put
sealant on though. it is way o much work, the other windows are relatively
easy though so i plan on pulling mine off but not till the spring.
I cracked a bus windshield using a rubber mallet and a piece of wood, i
guess i just got a little too physical:-)
