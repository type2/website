Hi-
	New to this list, I've been lurking since I came on last week.

	I'm the proud partner to Bessie II, a wonderful 1970 westy that is a
little rough around the edges, but has a strong heart. I've purposely
kept the exterior unrestored, but I've made some improvements inside.
I've installed two large solar panels on the pop-top, which feed an old
car battery (which in turn powers a small (hidden) tv, (hidden) stereo,
and/or my fridge.) 

	Nice car, been all over california, and has even done some of the 4x4
roads in Death Valley....

	ANYWAY, on to my question.... Bessie was violated last night. She was
broken into, had the dashboard ripped apart to get the stereo, speakers,
and all the tools were taken. The stereo had a removabel face that was
in the house with me.... The tv, second stereo, and the rest of the
do-dads were untouched. The missing tools really hurt.

	They got in through the passenger vent window, (not broken)....

	Anyone have any ideas on how to minimize theft? anything that was
considered valuable was out of sight...
