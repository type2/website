Subject: [T2] 1970 wheel cylinders



Well, I'm all squirreled up, and I guess I will never learn to write these 
down so I don't have to go through it all over each time.

What are the original part numbers for 1970 bus wheel cylinders  ?

I know there are two (2) cylinders on each front wheel;
&amp;
only one (1) on each rear wheel.

Do I wind up with six (6) unique part numbers?
