Subject: Intermittent Problem was missing at highway speeds Have similair problem

Replaced Tempeeture sensor, still won't start. Ist crank one pop, like a
tiny back fire at the end of the crank.
Then nothing on successive dry cranks.Curious about the lead from the
tempeture sensor which goes to a double connector one which goes into a
harnes and the other which grounds over these two metal canisters on the
left frount firewall, are they by chance the resistor ballast and the fuel
pump relay or the double relay,? I can't figure it out from my Haynes and
Muir. Where's a good place to get a Bentley? I need to get pass this.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;I'am worried about a similiar problem.  My 77 transporter cuts of for
&gt;days.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Then response to my attempts
&gt;&gt;&gt;to eliminate possible causes by running for days . Then cuts out again.
&gt;&gt;This
&gt;&gt;&gt;has happened 4 times . I'am also feeling quite insecure. The first time 4
&gt;&gt;or
&gt;&gt;&gt;5 months ago I cleaned and tightened all the grounds. After 2 days of
&gt;&gt;&gt;cleaning and fiddling she suddenly started and ran the 4 or 5 months with
&gt;&gt;no
&gt;&gt;&gt;problem. Two weeks ago she wouldn't start one morning. Would crank, but
&gt;not
&gt;&gt;&gt;start. would fire for 2 or 3 secounds and they die. New coil
&gt;&gt;&gt;cleaned all the grounds again, disconnected cold start valve leads. And
&gt;she
&gt;&gt;&gt;started up and ran for 3 or 4 days
&gt;&gt;&gt;maybe 10 to 15 start ups. But this time she wouldn't idle smoothly
&gt;&gt;&gt;immediately , had to rev her for a while  before she'd smooth out and not
&gt;&gt;&gt;die on me.  But she ran for a couple of days maybe 8 to 12 starts with
&gt;&gt;&gt;initial rough idle then run fine . Then again she wouldn't start. Cleaned
&gt;&gt;&gt;all air hoses and vacuum tubes. Air sensor  resistance with in bounds,
&gt;&gt;&gt;tempeture sensor resistance 1800 instead of 2500 ordered new one. Can't
do
&gt;&gt;&gt;any test that requires the engine to be running or warm etc. I'am
baffled.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Do you think the resistor ballast or the fuel pump relays (are they the
&gt;&gt;same
&gt;&gt;&gt;as the double relay?) might be the source of this INTERMITTENT problem .?
