Subject: Re: Getting an out-of-state bus home?

I thought most states gave you a certain amount of time from date of
purchase to register the vehicle. Like in WI it was 14 days last I
looked. If you were especially concerned, you could just register it in
the state you bought it in, giving the PO's address.
