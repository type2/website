Subject: starting problems

Greetings:
A month or so ago my 71 bus stalled out at a light. There was a slight
lurching, not sure if I had popped the clutch or if this even was related or
not. Within seconds the cab filled with smoke. After towing home, I saw that
one of the ignition wires had fried (the black 1.5 which leads to fuse 11. I
replaced this wire, but their is still no starting. I could not find any other
fried or disconnected wires. The engine turns but doesn't turn over. Also,
nothing on fuses 9-12 is working (not sure about that exactly, I know that
nothing on the last couple work..it has been a few weeks since I looked at
it.) Unfortuantely, all of the VW mechanics I knew of left after the
hurricanes (I'm in New Orleans). And even some of those didnt want to touch VW
electric work. It is a mess under their. I have done some electric work
before, but have never had a firm grip on it and don't have the time right now
to become an expert...Anybody have suggestions? Bad voltage regulator? could I
have fried that or my coil? Thanks...
