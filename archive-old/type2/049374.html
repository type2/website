Subject: [T2] Altitude adjustment for FI

I recently moved from Newton,Iowa (elevation 953 feet)
to Steamboat Springs, CO (elevation 7000ish)

Needless to say, my van, a 77 with the 2L, is unhappy.
 
The higher passes coming here were a real chore. There were times
when I couldn't make it out of first gear.

I'm experimenting with bumping up the spring tension in the AFM
to get a better &quot;fit&quot; between the injection curve and air density.
 
The setscrew inside holding the wiper to the arm seems to be a sort
of coarse offset, with the idle mixture screw allowing a bit of fine
tuning.
 
So, the steps seems to be
1) adjust spring tension until engine seems happy at both low/mid/high
ranges.
2) adjust offset for mixture as needed.

can anyone offer me more advice on going about this?
 
I'm tuning via ear and smell. It's fairly easy to hear the engine go
from excessively
rich to a &quot;better&quot; lean operation.

thanks all
matt
