Subject: RE: [T2] Gathering group to help engine drop  (Troy's bus)

I was told by someone that it has to be split to replace either the main
or rear main seal.  Can't remember which one.  I personally do not know
what needs to be done.  (I have been reading the engine drop procedure
in Bentley and stuff in the archives and have not run by this either.)
If that person is wrong, that would be fine by me.  :)

Hey Troy - what seal requires the case to be split?

A can't think of a single seal that requires case splitting.

By the way the case is the engine block.

Hope you and your wife are doing well.

&gt;Ill hold off on the trade for now...:)  One problem is the wife is 
&gt;pregnant at near 30 weeks and with possible pre-eclampsia.  So I am not

&gt;sure that I would be able to get too much out of her right now.  And 
&gt;would not expect much.  I guess the reason that I am so worried is that

&gt;one, I don't know how the whole engine works.  I know the concept, and 
&gt;what a lot the thing do, but the whole picture is far from there. 
&gt;Cracking that case to replace the seal is also something that I have 
&gt;really no idea about.  What part is the case?  (Its that bad.)  I have 
&gt;new fuel lines and injector seals in route to me right now from Busted 
&gt;Bus, so that should help out a lot.  They need to be replaced.  The 
&gt;other thing is that looking through the Bentley, I don't quite have all

&gt;the parts, nor the money to purchase them.  Sucks being the only one 
&gt;bringing in the income.  Like I said though, if I have to I will try 
&gt;and do it myself.  (Would just be much more comfortable with extra 
&gt;experience hanging around.)  Thanks...I'll let ya know how it goes.

&gt; &gt; or at someone elses.  The situation that I am in leaves me to try 
&gt; &gt; and do this on a weekend because it is my only mode of 
&gt; &gt; transportation. However, the bus will not make it much longer the 
&gt; &gt; way that it is and this needs to be done soon.  I am determined to 
&gt; &gt; get this done and if worse comes to worse, I will drop it at my 
&gt; &gt; house by myself.  (Knowing
&gt;
&gt;Have a little faith in yourself.  Turns out that a wife makes a great 
&gt;helper.  Dropping the engine is the easy part, just follow the Bentley 
&gt;intructions.  Make sure you have whatever tools (and parts) that are 
&gt;required to do your repair before you get started though. For me, it 
&gt;seemed that installation was a little more time consuming, but I was 
&gt;being careful to the point of my wife calling me anal.  If it's been 
&gt;awhile since your engine has been removed, it's a great time to 
&gt;clean/replace the engine bearer bracket bolts.  Oh, check that fuel 
&gt;line too.
&gt;
&gt;I'd suggest pulling the engine Friday evening, that way you have time 
&gt;to scrounge parts on Saturday if you come up short or break something 
&gt;during the removal/repair.
&gt;
&gt;I'd love to help but it looks like I'll be replacing the timing belt on

&gt;my wife's Rav4 this weekend.  Trade ya...
