Subject: Re: [T2] Acceptable speeds


&gt; How fast do you want to drive?  One thing I can say for sure, if you want
&gt; to cruise at more than 60mph reliably, you are talking a big investment, \

I typically drive 65-70 on the freeway...  slower if the flow of traffic is
not very high.  I'm not suggesting that the bus needs to be engineered
better for me, I'm just saying that driving this way is in my blood ( I used
to own a Buick Grand National if that tells you anything) but I like my
VW's. So, I need to find a way to decrease the chances of this happening
again.  It's not really practicle for me to change busses either, because
the investment to buy someone else's quirky vehicle is probably far higher
than just putting the equipment I need into mine.  Just my thoughts.

&gt; '70 you don't even have disc brakes, and you really want to be able to
stop
&gt; well if you're going to be driving that fast.  Sorry I don't have a more

And that is a very good point David.  Despite how fast I tend to drive, I do
keep the braking in mind and leave lots of distance to compensate for the
poorer braking system.  I also try to keep it in pretty good shape.  A brake
upgrade is definitely in my grand plan, but phase I is a running bus.  :-)
