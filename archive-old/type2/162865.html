Subject: re: body rust

&gt;  RIPO it down and stop worrying!!


	I forgot to add that, while RIPO's main mission is inside 
body members, where there is no point in trying to cover it, the 
mighty RIPO can also be useful even when the rust is visible.  RIPO 
dried a couple d can then take oil-based undercoat; indeed the 
Ministry of Works used to mix RIPO with their 'brand colour' orange 
oil-based paint and slap on just the one mixture.
