Subject: [T2] Re: Is the end near? Few VW buses seen at premier hippie
  gathering!

Todd said:

&quot;But as far as lack of hippies go...  most of them were in their early 20s 
in the 60s... that was 40 years ago! hahah.... so the majority of them are 
probably all in nursing homes.  ; )&quot;



Right, Todd.  you will still find us hitting on nurses in the hospitals, in 
the clinics, and in their homes.  It is a fine, carry-over tradition from 
the 60's!!
