Subject: Re: [T2] Main Engine Seal

Bob,

That is generally what I use also...I did have a vwflaps ask me if I
wanted the &quot;good&quot; ones and then they handed me the red ones.


Maybe some other problem?  

This is on a fresh engine?  Sealing surface ok?
Seated all the way to the bottom of the case?

Do you have one of those &quot;fancy&quot; installation tools..they really do work 
better than the other way...ask me how I know!

Lubed before flywheel installed?

You probably did all of this, but I have to ask...

Cheers, dave
