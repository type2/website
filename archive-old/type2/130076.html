Subject: Re: [T2] Do I need a HEATED O2 sensor?

 From the comments I have read regarding attempts to fit EFI to an 
air-cooled engine the answer is yes to the heated O2 sensor. The reason 
being the sensor has to get above a certain temp to work and it is unlikely 
to do so if the exhaust merge point is a long way back, such as in an 
air-cooled VW. The other relevant comment was to get a 4 wire rather than a 
3 wire sensor to avoid impedance problems.

Cheers,

Martin Strandgard
