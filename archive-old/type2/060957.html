Subject: roof skirt on '71 Dormobile
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

can anyone help.....the roof skirt on my '71 Dormobile has parted where it
was once joined ( presumably joined by heat ) and I would like to rejoin it.
Is there a suitable glue with which to do this....or can I rejoin it using
heat, and if so how? The roof is the original and is relatively good
condition other than the seams.
Thanks Garp
