Subject: Strange noises on downshifting
Message-ID: &lt;37841989.A66EB312_at_jps_dot_net&gt;

Hi Volks,
            I'm in the 300-mile break-in period on my AVP rebuild. It
seems pretty happy, but I'm getting a sound when I downshift, or even
when I let off the accellerator from a high RPM that was not there
before the rebuild. It sounds somewhat like &quot;
Flep.....flep,flep...flep&quot;. (Too bad I can't add a soundbite to this
post) Am i just being paranoid and is this normal on a rebuild, or does
it indicate a possible problem? I think I've heard it on older busses.
