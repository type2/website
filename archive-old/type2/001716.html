Hey list,

Nicky with the 71 is in Richmond, Va. We just came from her place, she got
the engine running by rotating the plug wires on the dizzy- yep 180 degrees
out. She called this evening all excited 'cause she got it running. So, we
went back to her place to check her timing. Figured we'd be there maybe 1/2
hour. We pulled up in the 68 (our roving tool box, actually the only place
we have to keep all our tools), and she said she found an oil leak. Coming
from the shroud. Asked her to start it up, and found serious leakage from
the shroud. Guessed the oil cooler was leaking, or maybe she pinched a seal
upon installation. So, we proceded to pull the engine (man I love being able
to remove the rear pan to do that!). Pulled the shroud, pulled the cooler,
WHOOPS! Guess who didn't put the cooler seals on! She didn't run it very
long (she said she shut it down as soon as she saw the pressure light
wouldn't go off).
She found the seals, we put the cooler back on, and had to stop at that
point. We're going away till next Wednesday, so I told her to do some stuff
while we're away, and we'll help her re-install the engine if she hasn't
found anyone else to help her. She's going to replace ALL the fuel lines
while the engine is out (drummed that into her head many times), recheck the
valve adjustment (they were clacking real loud), and redo the wires for
choke, stop solenoid, etc.....and a few other little things. I know, I know,
she shouldn't have missed those seals, and I do hope she's got everything
else right internally. But still, for a young lady who's never done this
before, and armed only with the Muir book, we're very impressed. We'll let
you know what's up when we get back from vacation. Who knows, she might be
on the list before we get back, if her roomie doesn't mind getting a bunch
of T2 mails every day ( I told her to subscribe in digest mode).

Thanks for all the replys to our first &quot;Nicky&quot; mail! As usual, the list
ROCKS!!
