Subject: Rat motor

Hi guys/gals,



I think maybe between the hot-rod and bus it is two entirely different
things unless the rod was not pretty looking. Rat is sometimes used for
type of built engine, mouse is also used, along with crate. Just
different ways of describing a certain motor. I don't exactly know what
a Rat motor is per se besides usually custom built. Crate motors are
just bought from a catalog like Jegs and then you open the crate and
drop the motor in. Go to Chevy Hi Performance's website and check out
the articles they have on Rat motors.



That is my idea,



Max Bronsema
