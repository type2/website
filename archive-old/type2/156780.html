Subject: Water Fuel

OK, I know that I am opening up a can of worms but a
friend and I are going to look into building both a
water fuel and air engine for a Type II.  First we
will try it on a mower and progress if it looks
hopeful.

I've read both good and bad on the subject but just
cause your  Momma told you not to touch the stove
because it's hot, you just have to find out for
yourself.
