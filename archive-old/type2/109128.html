rent if you choose not to bring your own.  Shopping opportunities (including
Amish goods) abound in historic Lanesboro and nearby communities.

All Vanagon and VW Bus enthusiasts are welcome.  You need not even arrive in a
VW; fellowship is the primary objective.  RV and tent sites are available in
our group area, and lodging is available both at the campground and in nearby
Lanesboro.  If you can't come for the entire event, please drop in whenever
you can.  Bring your own food, firewood, and all other preferred gear and
equipment.  Grocery, hardware, and numerous other stores and eating
establishments are located in Lanesboro.

Eagle Cliff Campground is located on MN Highway 16, just 2 1/2 miles east of
Lanesboro, MN.  Lanesboro is 40 miles southeast of Rochester, MN.  If you are
coming from the Twin Cities, take U.S. Highway 52 through Rochester, continue
southeast about 35 miles to Fountain, MN, go east 8 miles on Fillmore County
Road 8 to Lanesboro, go east 3 miles on MN Highway 16 to Eagle Cliff
Campground.  (If you get to Whalen, MN, turn around, as you have gone 1 mile
too far east.)  Access from Iowa and points south is via U.S. Highway 52

The success of any gathering of this type depends chiefly upon those
attending.  We hope that you will take the rare opportunity to become a
charter member of this annual event and join your fellow VW enthusiasts in a
fun-filled, relaxing weekend getaway.  As a special added bonus, Carol's
famous homemade chocolate chip cookies will be available for all attending.

Please address any questions to bpremack_at_mn.rr_dot_com  In order to assist in
planning, please RSVP as soon as possible.  However, there is plenty of room
available, so late responses or even drop-ins are welcome.   We realize that
this announcement is only one short week from the event, but VWers have
generally been a spontaneous group, so we hope that your schedules will permit
your participation.
