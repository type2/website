O.K. just one more,

        Indeed the laws of thermodynamics say that mechanical energy is eventually 
changed into heat.  So one way of thinking of this is that you can overcome the 
forces of friction in your engine very easily by turning your engine by hand 
(with plugs out).  Very little effort/energy/heat is required to turn your 
engine over so very little heat is generated in your engine.  Now think.  The 
energy of combustion (megacalories) is enough to push your one ton loaf up a 
hill at 55 mph.  As another person pointed out, friction makes you stop, 
combustion makes you go.  If the friction energy is greater than the combustion 
energy, you stop (putting on the brakes).
