No argument here...

The problem with this particular survey is that in a pair of similar year and model buses/transporters reporting MPG data: 

One could be giving numbers based on a calibrated odometer, correctly inflated and maintained tires of the proper size, fuel refills at the same station, pump, and tank level, healthy and well maintained engine, and a conservative driving style.

The other could have an uncalibrated odometer, 3 different tire sizes with the smallest and most undersized mounted on the left front and only inflated to 21psi, rotgut fuel dumped out of rusty jerry-cans, a clapped out engine running on 3 sick cylinders, a very leaky carburetor, and an erratic and aggressive driving style.

In both cases the operators report their bus/transporter MPG and with all the variables they might well give numbers that are quite similar, but there's no realistic basis for comparison.  It's not apples and oranges, it's apples and mushrooms.  They both came to the party, but they never danced to the same music..... 

===========================================
&gt;&gt;
Standard set procedure requires throwing out data that varies from the norm beyond the stated precision.  If you have ten figures between 17 and 23 and one of 12 and another of 27, you throw out the high and low and only mean/median/mode the rest.  You use only the most normal 95% of the data or 90% or whatever refinement the study calls for as stated precision/confidence.

2 sigma statements are used typically in most applied sciences with regard 
to sets of measures/observations. If more precision is required, more sets 
of observations are added until the 2 sigma confidence is proved within the maximum errors allowed.
