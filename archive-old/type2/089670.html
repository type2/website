Amen. The sad part is that Sears, along with K-Mart, Wal-Mart, Home De-
pot, etc. are known in the merchandising trade as &quot;cannibals&quot;...When they
open in an area, they devour the competition - usually by offering the same
&quot;type&quot; of product at a price that smaller or specialized stores can't pos-
sibly match. Unfortunately, the quality of the product is almost always
secondary to price. The homeowner/casual mechanic end of the product
line is what these giants carry because these are what moves fastest.
The smaller store carries these too, but also the tradesman and crafts-
man (in the best sense of the word) lines. Without the lower end volume
sales, the smaller stores can't afford to carry the better inventory and
eventually are squeezed out...
