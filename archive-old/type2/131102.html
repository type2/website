Subject: Help Right Away Please! Camper Q: 

Hi -

Sorry for the urgency (especially considering it's not an engine problem) 
but there's a wonderful guy at my house doing work for me and he/we have 
come across a problem.  He's removing all my '70 Riviera furniture to check 
for rust and he doesn't know how to take out the side closet/cabinet that 
goes all the way to the rear (next to the bed) without scratching the wood 
&quot;ceiling&quot; above/next to it (what you'd see if lying on the bed on your back 
and looking up).  Anyone out in cyberspace know how to remove this piece?  
If so, please write back asap or call us here in Portland at 503-335-3861.  
His name's Hal and he'll probably answer the phone.

Thank you thank you!

Marya
