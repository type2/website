Should have mentioned that I'm in Lake Havasu, AZ. Last week in California I
was paying $1.79 to $1.98 for regular. Sounds like we are really getting
screwed on the west coast (right coast) or is it left?

Where are you buying your pertol? We are paying $1.17 in Greensboro, NC. At
that price who cannot turn down a road trip in they're VW Bus?

Thank You,

  today I was pleasently supprised to find that regular gas has dropped to
$1.50 a gallon, last week it was $1.69 at the same location. Does anybody
else see this trend in falling fuel prices. If they keep dropping I might
make even more long distance road trips to VW shows.
