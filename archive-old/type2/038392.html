Subject: Topper help in/around Birmingham AL

If anyone is in or around Birmingham AL and knows how to install a camper 
top, please drop this lady a note. I guess when a tornado went thru the area 
awhile back, a big limb fell on her bus. A HONDA place in town is going to 
TRY and put it back on she says since she couldnt find a local VW person to 
help her.

Email Melanie at melanie.taylor_at_chsys_dot_org

or if you know someone in the area, please pass on the word.

Thanks,
David
