&gt; I just got my 1973 Westy back from the shop today and a light keeps

&gt; yellow and has a small &quot;B&quot; on it. It has flickered for a while then it
&gt; stayed on the rest of the way. Anyone know what that is?  My generator
&gt; light is going on too.

-It is the brake warning light, which monitors the pressure in the 
front brake/rear brake pressures in the master cylinder (they should be 
equal).  Anyway, if it comes on when you are driving, you should stop and
check out the brakes.  The Haynes manual has a good troubleshooting guide.

P.S. Before you start, make sure the parking brake switch is working 
properly, because it is hooked up to the brake warning light.
