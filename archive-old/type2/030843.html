Volks, 

I'll be there and I recommend you come, too!  A good time is always had 
by all.  If you need crash space/parking, and Tom's driveway is full, let 
me know!

(Administrators of Type2, Vintage and EV lists, please post, thanks)

We've scheduled the 4th  Annual  Mid-Atlantic Holiday Bus Fest for Sunday, 
December 13, from 1-4PM, at our home in Takoma Park, MD, just north of 
Washington DC, inside the beltway.

All flavors of Type 2s are welcome: EVs, Vanagons, Bays and Splits. This is 
an inclusive event with lots of kids, spouses and assorted hangers on,  so 
you do not have to come alone. Tom Carrington has posted a couple of pages 
of photos from past parties at http://www.relitech_dot_com/tomc/tomvw.htm if 
you'd like to get the flavor of past events:  this year we'll encourage him 
to take some photos of people too!

The details:

7001 Westmoreland Ave
Takoma Park MD 20912
(301) 270-8073

(There are about three general ways to get there: www.mapquest_dot_com can give 
you better directions than I can. If all else fails, from the Washington 
beltway you can go south on New Hampshire Avenue (RT 650), make a right 
onto Rt 410 at the &quot;Kwick Mart&quot;, stay to the left through two traffic 
lights to merge onto southbound Carroll Avenue at the firehouse, then make 
the second left onto Westmoreland, immediately after the gazebo.)

About 15 buses can fit in our long and narrow driveway, but the first one 
in is the last one out!  We tell the local police about the party and in 
prior years they have &quot;extended courtesy&quot; to buses that are parked &quot;only a 
little&quot; illegally, but don't block roads, driveways or fire hydrants. There 
is a big parking lot up the hill from the house on the other side of the 
street.

You can let us know if you plan to come to help us plan, great. If your 
plans are uncertain, don't worry about it, just come on by. Of course, feel 
free to bring a food or beverage to share.

As in the past, we can accommodate folks that need to camp overnight, on 
this one, please let us know ahead of time.
