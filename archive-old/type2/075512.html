Subject: Re: [T2] Please help me start this old bus!

Jim Polera sends:

&gt;   There has been an awful lot of talk about cleaning old fuel tanks. Is it
&gt; possible to buy a new one? Where? Would it be just as cost effective? Also,
&gt; if the inside of my tank isn't gunked up, should I still be considering
&gt; cleaning it?

Are you sure it's not gunked up? If you clean it, you will be.
