Subject: 68-79 camper needed in North Carolina area
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL - A

Hi,

I sold the Westfakia about two weeks ago and am actively searching 
for a 1968 to 1979 pop top camper in the NC, SC, VA area. I still 
have not found one. If you have or know of a pop top camper for sale 
that has a good body and interior please let me know. I really want a 
nice bus :)

Thanks
