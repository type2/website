Thanks Robert,

It is rather a drag. I am wondering also.

Is it commonplace for people to drive around without all of thier 
engine tin, meaning the underside of the engine?

Also, I guess the only issue is if you can feel the heater boxes 
leaking exhaust with your hand to tell if they are bad.

Anyone have any other tricks?

&gt; Without saying what sort of engine you have, or which side of the car

&gt; except that oil can leak from the rocker cover or pushrod tubes on both
&gt; sides of either type of engine.
&gt; 
&gt; The origin of an oil leak can be found by cleaning all the old oil off,
&gt; then
&gt; after a short drive inspect the engine to find where the leak is
&gt; starting.

&gt; good luck
