Sure.  My engine-driven A/C consumes 1.5 horsepower and cools the cabin
adequately up to about 100 degrees outside temp.  T-shaped evaporator
overhead in the cab has two vents facing rearward but does not cool the
back of the bus very well (but it's better than nothing).

&gt;I have been working on my '76 westy putting all the AC components in it,
&gt;but I really don't want to put in the under dash unit.  I would like to run
&gt;the AC camped as well as on the road, so I am planning on putting the
&gt;overhead unit in.  I know the unit will extend back into the hole in the
&gt;roof, but I will try to make it work.

Not sure what you mean by that, but if it's the T-shaped overhead unit that
you're talking about, it fits pretty well but reduces your headroom when
moving between the cab and the back of the bus.  Still, living in Texas, I
wouldn't trade it for anything.

I also have a 5000 BTU 110V unit that I've tried using in the front window.
It does not cool the back of the bus much at all in really hot weather.  I
think you would need double the BTUs or late-afternoon shade to be at all
effective.
