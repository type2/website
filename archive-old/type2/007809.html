Jason,

The part about the carwash having to recycle it's water may be true in
your are, but I assure you, it's not the norm for most of the country.
Furthermore, unless the carwash is SPECIFICALLY set up for dealing
with oil/grease disposal, it is most likely NOT being filtered out. 

I have looked for this type of carwash for a long time and in several
states (Idaho, Oregon, California and Arizona) as well, but have yet
to find one. I finally asked a carwash owner why they were so rare.
Aparently, they are cost-prohibitive to begin with and because they
involve toxic waste, are subject to federal, state and sometimes even
local regs. Again, costly.

I'm not saying I don't use a carwash on the occasional basis to clean
my motor (I do), but I don't kid myself as to where it's all going.
It's going to the same place it goes if I wash it in my driveway. 

I think this is a sad state of affairs, as the government, in it's
typically over-zealous (but miss-guided) attempt to clean up the
environment, has made it virtually impossible for most of us to clean
our motors in an environmentally-friendly way.

If you have one of these increasingly rare carwashes in your area,
you're very lucky.


Jaime
