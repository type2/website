Subject: Re: [WetWesties] Installing Cabinets and Z-bed size...

Ok so maybe I am just confused. Which is always quite possible. Is the 
SEAT all the same size and the size of the bed is the size of the 
cushion? 'Cause I don't have the cushion just the mechanical part that 
folds out and that's what looks small. Does this make any sense? This is 
what appears to me to be about 4 feet wide. With the metal parts and the 
base but no cushion. I am planning on ordering a cushion or having one 
made at an upholstery shop but thought the base was too small and I 
would need to find an all new, wider, folding out z-thingy. 
(&lt;---technical term)

I have seen them at www.zproducts_dot_com they are pricey and I really like 
that I got mine for free (along with the sink, stove, fridge, etc) so 
I'm hoping it's just that I am not getting something that's right in 
front of my face. :)

I'm definitely going to get the Bently. I of course didn't know any 
better and bought the Hayes first and I also have the Muir (which cracks 
me up and makes people look weirdly at me that I am cracking up reading 
a service manual). I'm gonna order one from a catalog since the local 
shop that carries it prices it at twice the amount as the catalog. Makes 
me worry about part prices.

Thanks everyone!

p.s. Have you ever tried to tell a chihuahua to sleep on the floor? 
Actually they don't take up much room as long as they sleep between my 
feet one being 5 lbs and the other about 12lbs. Now the Pit-beagle on 
the other hand will have to sleep in the front seat :)

&gt; Hello,
&gt; First, the Bentley manual for the loaf ('68-'79) bus has very detailed 
&gt; instructions for removal and installation of the Westfalia Camping 
&gt; interior. So If you have the Westy cabinets then you need the Bentley 
&gt; manual. You should have a copy anyway, as it covers so much about your 
&gt; bus.
&gt; Second, My wife (5'0&quot; and 130#) and I (5'9&quot; and 150#) and two whippet 
&gt; dogs (29 and 35#) sleep ok in the standard Westy bed. No it's not the 
&gt; same as the queen bed at home but for a few days on the road it works 
&gt; just fine. If our dogs were much bigger or long haired we would find 
&gt; some other system, like leave the dogs at Grandma's house. ;-)

&gt;&gt; Date: Thu, 13 Jun 2002 13:23:12 -0700
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Hello,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I am in the process of refinishing the cabinets that I got for Buster.
&gt;&gt; (Thanks Bill!) What I wondered is if anyone knows where to find
&gt;&gt; instructions on how to install them once I get them finished. I have
&gt;&gt; been collecting pictures of interior shots hoping to at least figure out
&gt;&gt; the placement, but would be even more grateful for a manual, web page,
&gt;&gt; etc... as some of the bits I'm not positive where they would go.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Also, the z-bed seems a tad small to me. Like the size of twin bed. Do
&gt;&gt; these come in different sizes? I had read that the size was more akin to
&gt;&gt; a full or even a queen. I'm afraid that the two of us are not going to
&gt;&gt; fit on that bed, not to mention the three dogs ;) Is there a way to make
&gt;&gt; it larger, or do I need to look into a different bed altogether? I'll
&gt;&gt; try to get some pics up this weekend. Maybe that will help.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks again to all you great people for being so kind in answering my
&gt;&gt; stupid questions!
