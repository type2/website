Subject: Transmission or Driver problem? Reg or Synthetic Tranny oil?

There was a post the other day similiar about someone that had 2 gear grind 
when downshifting....similiar to what I'm experiencing.

'71 Westy pretty sure original Tranny, checked the Tranny gear oil right 
after I got the bus and it was grimy but full.  Heard that Synthetic Castrol 
Gear Oil (75/85 I believe) is the way to go so I've been trying to come up 
with the cash to change out gear oil but have had other priorities.

2nd gear has started to grind when downshifting, well I can keep it from 
grinding but you have to do this special thing and be at just the right 
speed and it doesn't grind.

Is this on my driving or is this because the gear oil needs to be changed 
out??

Also, is synthetic the way to go with the gear oil? Will it really keep my 
tranny lasting forever?

Thanks in advance

Daniel
