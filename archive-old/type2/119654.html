Subject: Cheap Bentley Manuals and wont start 78 Westy

Amazon is having a promotional price on Bentley type 2 repair manuals.
$27.97 and free freight.  I just ordered one before my old one falls
completely apart.

Now the Tech problem.  I tried to change coils from Bosch OE to Pertronix
the other day.   However, it would not start.  I switched back to the Bosch,
and still no go.  I am pretty sure I got the wires on the right terminals,
but would welcome anybody's suggestions. I am getting spark from the
distributor end of the HT lead off the coil but I can't tell if it is
powerful or not.  Jumps about a half inch gap to ground.  A test light
between Coil terminal one and the positive No. 15 does show an on-off
pattern to be expected as the Ignitor breaks the coil circuit. No. 15 is hot
with a red wire from( I think, the starter, but am not sure.  Also has the +
side of a Pertronix Ignitor, back up light and heater wire.  The No. 1 has a
white going to the dual relay , a brown going where I cannot see, and the
negative from the Pertronix Ignitor.  I will come back to my office tonight
with my wife and  Honda and try to figure out what it wrong.  Our parking
garage is warm, dry and light.  Any advice is appreciated.  I don't want to
let the bus sit in the parking garage forever, and due to low clearance, I
could not have it towed out if I wanted to.
