Subject: More missing parts?

Gotta say how much I appreciate the tips and advice. Also have to say
that I wish Bentley had an exploded diagram of an 1800...

On the top, front, left half of my crank is what appears to be a
flywheel inspection hole, roughly an inch and a quarter in diameter.
Should this hole be plugged with something?

On the bottom of the case, offset from center is a circular apparition
about the same diameter as the oil strainer cover. There is a black
metal plate inside this hole, but it looks somewhat as if something is
missing...the black plate is recessed about 1/8'' or so--sorry for being
such a dimwit, but what is this thing and how is it *supposed* to
appear?
