Subject: Re: [T2]Triple AAA tows vehicles not Families

This is such a great idea Jay...... Now just to find time to get something like that done....
Tripl AAA was wrong for what they did morally and big companies need to be just as liable for there actions as that of anyone else on two legs are held accountable for.
 
i posted this in awareness for other bus drivers and there families as something that Could happen to them in warning to prepare if they could? We do travel good bit in the bus so for us to have this on us even if i have to next time i will crawl in the back of the bus and act as if my wife and little one were alone so that we all three can get home.... Damn even that seems a shame since we should all be able to get home with Tripl AAA plus membership. Again i think it has alot to whom the dispatcher is you finally get put through to. Also dont forget about the tow driver that comes for the call.... sometimes the tow truck driver can make that final decision on who rides with him or not though and he only has to honestly take one person and maybe not even that person????
my thing is this crazy as some it may seem my bus is pART of my family and i am not letting some strange man or woman haul my bus(child)(wife)(dog) anything off without us together. I didnt the other night either and wasnt,.,.,.,.
we all came home two tow trucks but were one right behind the other carrying all of us home using two tows.... i gotta name for triple aaa but wont use it here.
 
 
 
take care and thanks
Cha

I wonder what would happen if several of the folks that have had this 
same thing happen to them wrote a letter with all the facts of their 
incident and sent it to all of their local papers and news agencies. Many 
news folk seem to like tragic stories and use fear to sell their product. 
&quot;What you don't know about your auto club, could your family be at risk? 
Find out on Action news at eleven!&quot; The visual of the loving wife or 
husband left on the side of the road in the rain while spouse and child 
drive off into the night with the creepy tow-truck guy might be enough to 
get them interested in printing or airing the story? It would only cost a 
few stamps and a little time. I dunno, just a thought. If even one local 
rag printed it you could send it in to AAA just as a little screw you right 
back statement :-)
