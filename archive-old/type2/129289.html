Subject: [T2] 2.0 FI timing way out?

Thanks all,
I have fooled with the timing enough now that I am starting to rule that
out.  I know I assembled everything carefully just as Tom described it - 
TDC and rotor points to the notch - no problem. When I do get it
roughly running there is a 'sweet spot' which is close to the cold start
valve.  I tried pulling the cold start valve connector so I would have
more travel but rotating it any further makes it worse.  I also tried
all other plug wire distributions (+90, +180, swing distributor back and
forth while trying to start)

Massive vacuum leak may be a more likely cause. I blocked the EGR port
but perhaps not good enough, or one of the other 1/2 dozen possibilities...
