&gt;over the first mark on the oil dip stick(pretty low I guess)....so I didn't 
&gt;add any oil..drove for about 20 minutes tops...had the bus parked for 5 
&gt;hours orso...went to check the level before I left work and the oil level 
&gt;was much higher..almost to the top line on the dip stick...Any ideas what 
&gt;is going on here?

Waiting anxiously for any answers here. Both our running uprights...71 SC 
and 69 KG...are frustrating in the oil-check department. I stick the damn 
stick in 6 times and come up with 5 readings (so of course I go with the 2 
that are the same). Don't have this problem with the pancakes. What gives? 
Thanks..
