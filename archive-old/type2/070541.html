&lt;&lt;  Picking over a said-to-be-74 Bus, I pulled the wiring 
&gt; (intact, just
&gt; plugs, no cuts) and the large plug and silver box from the upper right side 
&gt; of 
&gt; the engine bay. Part # on the silver box is VW 022  906  021  S, Plug # is
&gt; 022 906 239. I tried my Unisyn on it but got nuthin' :-(  I'll pass this on 

that is an Electronic Control unit from a 1977 manual tranny fuel injected
bus.   check bus serial number it is probably a 77 bus
 &gt;&gt;

Thanks-
            Anybody interested? Bus has serious rust in the frame (dangerous
enough to look like it might not survive moving), and dead tires. No engine
but some other FI parts...The owner claims his son pulled the engine years
ago to get it repaired and that was it. I'll try and get a list of the FI 
parts
and post them.
