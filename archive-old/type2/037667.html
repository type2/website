&gt; I need to find a source of the push-on electrical connectors for the
&gt; various switches in an L-Jetronic FI engine. One of mine has cracked and
no
&gt; longer grips the switch.   I visited my local VW dealer today and was told
&gt; that they only take orders for parts on cars newer than 1980.  Can anyone
&gt; suggest a source?
&gt; Thanks, Jack
