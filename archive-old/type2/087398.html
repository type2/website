Subject: Re: [T2] Aftermarket Tents

I bought an aftermarket tent several years ago made by Eureka.  We were 
traveling up the east coast to New Brunswick and stopped at LL Bean.  It was 
apparently made for SUVs, bit fit nicely on Lurch!  It has a cowl that 
fastens onto the back of the vehicle.  It has a zip-up door on that side 
also.  It functions great as a stand-alone.  You just back up to it and 
attach the cowl onto the back, open the hatch, and your living space is HUGE.
