Subject: Hissing sound when hand cranking???

I have (hopefully not) discovered a yet another *!!#$%! problem with my
bus.  As I turn the engine over by hand, about once per crank, at about the
same place (and I forgot to note just what place), there is a hissing sound
coming from the vicinity of #3.  Any ideas what this might portend?

Thanks,
Eric &amp; Maggie
