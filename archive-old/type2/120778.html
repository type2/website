Subject: Re: [T2] heater cables question

-Which of the heater box cables is left and which is right (one has a
bend, one has a loop), and which lever(s) do they attach to?

Right side is the passenger side. The left and right cables work off of the same lever as I recall (on the dash). 

-there is a third (broken) cable coming up from somewhere - where does
that go to and which lever does it hook up to?

My '78 has 4 cables. 2 cables open and close the heater box output and thus how much heated air (that's a relative term of course! &lt;grin!&gt;) gets to the cabin. That's right at the engine. 

There is another cable that opens and closes the front floor vents. That is the flapper determines how much heat (there's that term again!) goes to the windshield and how much goes to the floor. It is inside the vertical heater tube under the dash and factory painted white. I need this cable...

Lastly - and this is another one I need - there is a cable that goes to a flapper box located in the first crossmember behind the front suspension that determines how much heat (!) goes to the front cab area and how much gets dumped out under the rear seat and/or out of the floor vent at the rear edge of the walk-through between the front seats. 

Here's a question for you: I have the cable sheaths but the two short cable wires are shot. What kind of wire is this? Is this larger diameter piano wire? I'd like to shop for about 25 feet and replace (recreate) my short cables. I do not think Bus Depot and friends offer these cables... Info: I know motorcycle and bicycle cables are stranded cables and thus not the right stuff. 

Thanks!
