Subject: 34-PDSIT-2/3 rebuild

I'm rebuilding my first set of these dual solex carbs and going through the testing procedure two things are puzzling me. 

1) The accelerator pump is rated for 0.8-1.0cc. The book says you'll expell 10x that much with 10 quick pumps but the rate I can get is 0.7cc pumping it slowly. What does this indicate? If there anything I can do about it? 

2) The spec for the float is 12-14mm from the top of the lower body. There are no leaks and the valve is working correctly but the best I can achieve is 17-18mm. It's not possible to un-shim the float valve to raise the level. Because of the design of the float chamber, bending the float support doesn't seem possible either. Stumped... 

Any experts out there?
