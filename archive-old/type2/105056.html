&gt; Hey AirCooled Gang!,
&gt; 
&gt; I finally bought a VDO 7000 rpm tachometer and need a little help with the
&gt; install.  All the directions make sense except for the part that shows
&gt; wiring the tach to the fuse box.  Which fuse do I wire it to?  I think the
&gt; accessory fuse is #9, I have to look at the manual again to make sure.
&gt; 
&gt; My bus is a 78.  I know many of you have them installed, any pointers?

Why not take the pos 12v wire from the gauge cluster so it is the fused with
the other dash instruments? There should be a black wire attached to the
metal area where the warning lamps plug in on the rear of the cluster, this
wire will be the 12v supply for the dash.

There is nothing wrong with going off the fuse box, to be sure, but the tach
does not draw much power, and it is easier to to get at the back of the
cluster than the back of the fuse box.
