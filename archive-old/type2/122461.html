&gt; Has anyone on

I have a 79 california spec westy, and I have looked into this as well. I
converted it to use 72-74 exhaust and kept the o2 sensor.

&gt; Are you even more confused now? :-)

No, you have explained it well.

Your recommendations are good. You MUST keep the o2 sensor or that engine
will not run properly, and I like your parts solution to doing that. I have
the o2 sensor plumbed into the #3 exhaust manifold, which is a compromise
solution. It works, but has some inherent problems.

I am working on a new exhaust system for my bus which should become the
prototype for a new product. It will use the 72-74 heater boxes and a custom
made crossover to allow a higher flow muffler for performance applications.
(The 72-74 muffler works well on a stock engine, but for a modified engine
it is far too restrictive) The side benefit of making a custom crossover for
the 72-74 heater boxes is being able to plumb the o2 sensor into the merged
part of the crossover, either for busses that need it to run, or for tuning
purposes. You could do this with the aftermarket '79 non-cal crossover, but
that is very expensive and will not flow particularly well, hence the need
for a better-flowing, cheaper part.
