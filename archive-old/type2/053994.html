Subject: RE: Air/Fuel Mixture Monitor

There's plans for making your own Air/Fuel mixture monitor by a 914 driver
over at www.pelicanparts_dot_com. He used a generic O2 sensor and built his own
LED meter. You could also use a voltage meter for measuring once you know
the output voltage values for the different mixture levels. Pelican parts
server is down right now or I'd post a URL
