Subject: Re: [T2] Excellent tune up

Yep,
I just looked at the big auction site by the bay and see Snap-on in a padded

If you are not married to Fluke you can get a good deal on a meter that's 
designed for automotive diagnosis.
I have no beef about Fluke but for the non professional mechanic it is more 
meter than I need.
