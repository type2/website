Volks,

I have a good solid 72, original paint, 1700cc dual carb (Weber) weekender
for sale. The engine is very clean, I know I cleaned it. It has new points,
plugs, condenser, wires, air filter, oil filter distributor cap (050
distr.). It runs well, but I need to sell it. I am moving to Italy in two
weeks. I also have a complete AC setup for this if you are interested.
The bus needs minor rocker work, floor work and small dent pulled out of
nose. This van is remarkably rust free for an New England vehicle.

I can send pics.

Matt
I live in Somersworth, New Hampshire.
