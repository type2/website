Subject: KONI shock group buy update

Just spoke to the Koni salesman today...

A small quantity (7 sets of four) are arriving in roughly a week.  When they
arrive, I'll send them to the first seven people who put their orders in. (I
haven't gone through yet to see who that is.)  As for the rest of the
shocks, Koni has already completed all of one side (front or rear, I forget
which) and is near completion of the other side. To avoid taking a huge loss
on shipping, they will send them to me all at once when they're all ready.
Koni says they should hit port in the U.S. around the third or foutth week
of this month, and is estimating that I'll have them at my door somewhere
around March 10 (allowing time for U.S. customs clearance).  Bear in mind
this is an estimate, and it could go either way depending on how fast they
clear customs.

If you were one of the first seven to order you'll know in a week or so.
Otherwise I'll post an update to the list when the rest are here (or en
route).
