Subject: Re: Alternative Fuels (long and depressing)

Thanks for this long list of alternative fuel sources.  It did get me to 
thinking though...

I am thoroughly convinced that there are alternative sources that exist 
that we don't know about and that there are carbs and FI systems that can 
far out perform what exists today.  The reason is that these big oil 
refineries stand to lose lots of money if all of a sudden, something 
other than gasoline and/or diesel was used to propel vehicles.  Although 
it's my opinion, I've read about the same kind of thing happening with 
pharmacutical companies and how they won't make a drug unless there is 
a &quot;market&quot; for it - regardless if there is a small minority who could 
benefit from it.  Same goes for the fuel industry.  If you would take 
away the greed and corruption, I'd be willing to bet that you'd see some 
monumental leaps and bounds in this area.

This is just my opinion though.  I could be totally wrong (as has often 
been the case) but it does tork me off when big business stands in the 
way of progress...
