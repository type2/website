Subject: 71 Westy Parts &amp; Front Hammoack!!

gang,

as you may or may not remember i am in the process of
tearing down a 71 westy for the purpose of selling the
parts. today i was doing some more work(dan spencer i
have your sink, if you still want it)and i discovered
one of the hammocks that hangs over the front seats!!!
i wanted to keep it, but it won't fit my 76, so now i
offer it to you, the list.
