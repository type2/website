Subject: re: Vanagon stalls after acceleration

&gt; where should I focus on the troubleshooting?


Hello

I'd try the fuel filter first.  Also it may sound silly but are you certain
your gas is ok?

Other than that I'd checkout the electrical components.  Is everything ok
inside the distributor?  Any rusty electrical connections in the back?

As someone said on this list before, problems are always due to fuel, spark or
compression.  The hard part is to find out which.  From there fixing it will
be easy.

Good luck,
Shawn.

P.S.  It's true about the AAA card.
