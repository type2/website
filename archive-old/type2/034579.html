    This is going to become one of the longest threads in history.....I can
feel it.    90, in a splitty!!!! I had trouble keeping my lunch down. 2,500
miles ,I would assume without checking the oil once and throwing a rod, Im
sure thats what he meant by &quot;engine trouble&quot; Im sure the engine was in
perfect order until it was driven into the ground. TIME TO GET GREASY
SHOEPHONE MAN!!! My heart falls at the thought of him becoming &quot;attached to
the little vw&quot; Unless it means hes going to lift the engine hatch at times
other then putting out the fire. If I was the radical I thought I was I
would form a VOLKSWAGEN RETRIEVAL ORG. to save these mistreated bus's. A
little midnight mission would be needed here!!!
    Its as if this were a DOG LOVERS LIST and someone put up a web site &quot;20
WAYS TO ABUSE YOUR DOG&quot;  *with pictures!!  :)
 (how long b4 someone gets brave and Emails this guy to find out what the
heck he's doing?)

Have a great friday all
Blue is going under the wrench weds.(d-day for rebuild) Keep your fingers
crossed.
