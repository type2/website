&lt;&lt; Can't do this with a Bus, it's a unibody design.  I suppose you could gut

the new Bus and install everything from the new Bus into the old Bus shell

but doing that you might as well just restore your old Bus to original

specs, at least if it's a late bay you get the Type 4 :-)

Andddd...It also depends on the state that gets to inspect it...If you change
out an old car/bus and install a &quot;new&quot; engine the year of the engine is the
year of the smog requirements. I &quot;think&quot; California is one of them, BTW.
