&gt;&gt;AMEN!!!  A bit of anti-sieze on the threads and then leave them in till 
&gt;&gt;they wear out.  :)

&gt;&gt;As far as I'm concerned the only good reasons for taking the spark plugs 
&gt;&gt;out are: its time to replace them; you are playing with your carburation 
&gt;&gt;and need to find how clean you're burning; or if you question your 
&gt;&gt;compression.  I'm a believer in, &quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it.&quot;  Just 
&gt;&gt;do regular maintenance to keep it that way.  I've had a spark plug strip 
&gt;&gt;out 100 miles from home (P/O cross threaded it) and don't like to tempt 
&gt;&gt;fate by taking plugs out just because. &lt;&lt;

Thanks, guys.  I'll leave 'em alone after I figure out my jetting.
