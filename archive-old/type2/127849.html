Subject: [T2] Bus camping fans?

curious i got a marine battery not sure of size but a marine battery and big ole sucker..?
its run from my relay that was purchased from bus depot sometime ago....
i am curious as far as running fans off of it?
 
i have seen the fans that plug into a cigarette lighter and i have a plug that is run from my marine battery..?
now how long or much power should i expect this fan of small size or two to run on that marine battery..
 
shouldnt drain the battery down just for overnight wind right?
i am sure some of you have them set up some how was just curious cause i know it gets awfully muggy sometimes up in the bus and i would think that a nice little small breeze from a fan could help me to breath a little better without opeing the door all the way up how i usually sleep lol.... and freeze and let all the bugs in...
thanks
peace
