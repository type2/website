&gt;I'd contact the vendor about those clamps...The stock swaybar clamp
&gt;is a shorter in diameter at the front than at the back; it's also roughly
&gt;&quot;D&quot; shaped... The picture above doesn't &quot;seem&quot; to be the same...It
&gt;looks like a plumbing part (I could be wrong...) that's used as a clamp
&gt;over a repair patch on hard-to-reach/remove pipes...Any &quot;real&quot;
&gt;plumbers wanna verify that...Like I said I'm just goin' by the picture... ;-(

ACN is selling a common t-bolt clamp. The clamps in the photo are for beele only. If you get a bus kit I'm sure they provide just one clamp.
