Subject: Re: [T2] Yep, it's a PCV valve ... sort of

Hi Mark,

It shouldn't be too difficult to replicate the case breather.. form a 
base plate from 1/2&quot; plastic and thread it with a stock PCV valve that 
has appropriate vacuum line fittings. Glue a pair of plastic tabs onto 
the base plate to emulate the height of the original metal box you can 
continue to use the stock bale to keep the valve in place, or you could 
just goop it into place permanently with an appropriate gasket 
adhesive.

Once the base plate has been built the PCV valve can be replaced 
periodically as required.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
