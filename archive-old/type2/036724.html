Subject: Re: Gauge placement questions

Well,
What started out as a quick reply to this post turned into an 8 hour session at
the computer.  What happened during that 8 hours is.... I started building a
homepage so that everyone could see how I mounted my gauges.  The homepage is
kind of rough and doesn't give a lot of written detail as to how I built my
instrument holder, but I got some good pictures of it.  The instrument holder is
non-invasive.  I didn't have to destroy any part of my bus to mount it.  If you
can wait for the info, I will be adding  more details to my homepage as time
allows.  If you want details right away I'll be happy to answer any e-mails.
