&gt; Arrgh- had to test the engine lid key (kept in its magnetic box)- locked
&gt; fine, but will not unlock! Key slips in, will not turn; tried lubricant,
&gt; nada- Anyone (like the locksmith here) know how to break into this? 
&gt; Unlike the hatchlid, you can't push in the button when locked.  I don't
&gt; mind destroying the lock (have extra nonlocking type) but don't want to
&gt; wreck the lid.  Adding oil/cheching timing will be mighty tough through
&gt; the upper inside hatch!!

might try going through the hatch and opening the catch from the inside,
then remove the lock completely and rekey or check the pins.
