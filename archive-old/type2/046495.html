Subject: [T2] BA6 Gas heater troubleshooting

Hello, I am trying to locate a problem with my gas heater and m hoping
someone out there can help me.  My heater fires up during the startup
processs and blows lots of hot air.  However it seems that once upper temp
is reached and the heater cools down, it will not re-light.  I can hear the
fuel pump running and all fans, however, it won't get warm again and
eventually goes into run down.  The safety swith does not activate in this
case. If I then attempt to re-start it it will not light up again, it will
turn off after a couple of minutes (run doiwn mode I assume) and the safety
switch will need to be reset due to no ignition taking place during start
up. (76 Westy, BA6)
  
Anyone have any comments - right now i am thinking that it may be the temp
sensor, or the spark portion of the spark/glow plug (possibly caused by a
bad coil to plug wire). 

A couple of questions for those who may know: 1.)  Does the glow part of the
spark/glow plug energize only during start up (and not during temp
regulation phase), and is ignition during temp regulation phase achieved
therefore by the spark protion of the plug?  2.) how can I check or bypass
tmperature sensor to find out if this is the problem?

Any comments are appreciated.

Thanks, Brad
