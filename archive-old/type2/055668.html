	 &gt; A friend has a wooden box with ZELENDA US 297 written on it
and it is complete with all

&amp; pinions on swing axles. I read in 
	&gt; the list a while back about someone who is into this but I
can't find it. Could some one 
	 &gt; please tell me if that is what it's for and if it is worth
much.

	Vw297 is used for setting up/adjusting the ring and pinion gear
backlash.  You set this backlash by moving the ring gear towards (and
away) from the pinion. 

	Vw289 is used to set up the 'sideways' tolerance of the ring and
pinion, for the face of the ring gear has to be a specified distance (I
don't have the specs to hand)  from the center line of the pinion gear.

	I don't know what the tool (297) would be worth in the US
market.  I have a friend who pick up a cupboard full of vw tools
(including ALL the transmission special tools and jigs) for $200
Australian.......just demand and supply I guess..
