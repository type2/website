&gt; 	Yup,  That is the assumption I made.  Car makers give limits on
&gt; speed and distance, however, why chance it?  I removed the CV joints so that
&gt; the transaxle and automatic transmission would not spin at all.  This choice
&gt; was easier because one CV had a torn boot and all the other boots are sad
&gt; looking and cracked.


DON'T FORGET to mark left and right, on an auto tranny the CV shafts are
different length
