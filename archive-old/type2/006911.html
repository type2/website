&gt;  Who *does* have correct front door to body seals now (for early
&gt;bus)?

The best door to body seals I have seen are the West Coast Metric
ones.  The profiles are pretty correct, but the color is wrong.
The Wolfsburg West front door to body seals I got a year or two
ago were the correct color, but every piece was the same contour
as the cargo door rubber.  I'll take the correct contour over the
correct color any day.

Hm, I thought this originally meant the weatherstrip on top of the door, the
one that attaches to the window frame, and seals between the top of the door
and the frame.   I guess you mean the stuff that is glued to the frame.   I
didn't like the repros I saw, the cross section was wrong.  It was made of
one kind of rubber foam stuff, while the original was rubber round the
outside, foam in the inside, which gives a completely diffent level of
squishiness and sealing.   I  forget the brand though.   I stick with good
used, haven't seen a decent repro, and would be glad to hear of one.
I found a stray window frame top seal in the garage, I'll put in on Nellie
drivers door, when I find a frame with a good wing window latch.  Water
dribbles in there.
