Importance: Normal

&gt; To run the accesories that are wired into the aux battery while
&gt; the bus is running is exactly what the instructions that come with the kit
&gt; says NEVER to do.


Actually, what the instructions are saying, in a somewhat cryptic manner, is
that _to allow optimal charging performance_, you should not run items off
the aux battery when charging.  Not that doing so will actually harm
anything (under normal circumstances).

To understand this, you need to know how the relay kit works. The Hella
setup is essentially designed to provide the aux battery with a moderate,
almost trickle charge, rather than to jolt it with a full charge as with the
starting battery.  This is the safest, if not the fastest, way to recharge
your auxilliary battery, and is precisely the same setup that Westfalia used
in the campers that came equipped with dual batteries. (In fact, Hella made
those relays as well.)  It is also important to note that you must use the
wire gauge provided with the kit in order to maintain that intended rate of
charge.  This is a case where upgrading to a lower gauge (heavier) wire is
not a desireable thing, and in fact can result in the relay overloading and
popping the fuse.

It's a matter of simple math.  The alternator (via the relay) is delivering
a fixed amount of current to the aux battery when you drive.  As long as the
amount of charge going into the battery (from your alternator while driving)
is higher than the amount going out (being consumed by your accessories
while driving), the battery will charge.  The higher the ratio of current
going in to current going out, the faster it charges.  If you are not
running anything off of the aux battery while driving, the battery will
charge at the maximum rate that the setup allows (which is what the
instruction sheet is trying to say).  The more stuff you are running, the
slower it will charge.  If you are running so much stuff while driving that
they are drawing as much as the current going in, the battery will not
charge at all.  If you are trying to run stuff that draws _more_ current
than the battery is taking in (such as a huge sound system), the battery
will actually discharge even if you are driving (but at a reduced rate), and
if you are doing this often, you need to consider a different alternative.

What does this mean to you?  If your aux battery is dead, or nearly dead, it
is best to avoid running anything with moderate or high drain when driving,
at least for a while until the battery gets some of its charge back.
Particularly if you will not be driving for very long before using the aux
battery with the engine off again.  A dome light, radar detector, stock
Westfalia fridge, or other typical accessories should be fine.  A basic
indash stereo at low to moderate volume should be fine, particularly if the
aux battery is low but not nearly dead.  A killer sound system played at
high volume is probably not fine.  In other words, just like the &quot;stock&quot;
dual battery relay on a late model Westy, this relay kit is designed for
average demands of typical campers, but not high-performance demands like a
huge sound system or whatever.  If your demands will be of the high current
variety, such as a high wattage amplified sound system, etc., you may want
to use a dual battery solution specifically designed for high-draw
applications (such as a heavy duty isolator setup, although such setups do
have their own shortcomings), or perhaps augment the relay setup with an A/B
switch as someone suggested.  But for more typical applications, the simple
relay kit will work just fine as-is.

Hope this clears up any confusion.
