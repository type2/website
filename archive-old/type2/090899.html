Subject: full gas tank = gas leak  Easy fix

This is a very common problem on old busses and
one of the easiest fixes you'll ever do. 

Open the engine compartment.  Reach behind your
spare tire well and feel for two pieces of metal
pipe and a Z shaped piece of hose.  Take the hose
off.  Go to flaps.  Tell them you want 1 foot of
this size hose.  Cut the new hose to size and
replace.  It's a vent hose so no clamps necesary.
 

Have fun and do it soon,

Ray

Peace and blessings,
