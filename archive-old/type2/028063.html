What year did VW loose the wall (forgot the term) behind the passenger seat? Was that in '74? I'm toiling with the possibility of getting a '74 Sportsmobile...been thinking about it for almost a month now...and this has later model seats in it and no &quot;wall&quot; behind the passenger's seat. I'm wondering if dude cut this out or not.

Thanks! Joe
