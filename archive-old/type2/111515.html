Subject: Manifold Problems

I have a 1978 bus with leaks between the exhaust manifolds and the 
heads.  I have removed all of the pertinent bolts (and without even 
breaking off any studs).  My problem, I cannot get either manifold to budge.  
It's as if they were welded to the heads.  Any suggestions?
Thanks,
Jim
