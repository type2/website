Subject: Engine Swap 

Does anyone know what would be required to swap a fuel injected motor into
a '74 bus?  I already have converted to an electric fuel pump, so putting
in a higher pressure pump isn't going to be a problem, but what else is
involved?

I understand there is some kind of electronic equipment on the fuel
injected buses, is this difficult to wire into a bus originally equipped
with a carb?  I'd like to put in a motor, maybe a 2.0 from a later model
bus.  My carbs are dying, and I just like FI better anyway.

Thanks,
Craig
