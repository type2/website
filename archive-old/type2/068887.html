Subject: HVLP paint guns

Well anyone who has read Gerry's FAQ written about paint by myself
realizes that I used to use a couple of generic guns.  But recently
as I was going to paint my uncles truck I started looking at better
stuff, and in the course decided, what the hey, how bout that new
HVLP crap.  Now a few things to start, Harbor sells a couple now
and they look excellent, are either gravity feed or pressure pot, for
a regular use on air hose HVLP this is the only way to work, to improve
atomization as U are not using extreme air flow to do it, you got to
feed the paint under pressure, gravity seems sensible as well.
Some have standard 1 qt pots on the gun but they are pressurized. In
general if it says HVLP and its a converted but still siphon gun I
would not believe it.  Now top o the mid level HVLP for airline seems to
be Accuspray.  Very nice also make &quot;real HVLP&quot; turbine guns, looked at
em locally gun is $450, from Eastwood a little less, either way too
much for me.  So look locally for alternatives and Sharpe comes up,
and as this local price missprices the gun $50 to my favor since normal
paint guy is out for 3 weeks I could not resist.  I decided on the
SGF gravity feed model as I like the balance and will live with the
smaller cup.  They had the &quot;siphon&quot; model in stock but just didn't
jive to me.  The pressure and gravity versions are converted regular
guns, pressure reduction and big holes in air caps, but seem sensible
and just like the Accuspray but cheaper.  I paid $175, everyone else
here wanted $215-$225.  Then got the new Harbor freight catalog and
almost cancelled the order as their new gravity model looks nice
for $60 or so but hell I figure its time to finally own one I can
get different nozzels and rebuild kits for.  I'm touching up a
ding in the Corrado this weekend and I'll tell how it goes.  I note
that most of these guns demand a 3/8&quot; air line with 3/8&quot; fittings and
extreme air delivery, like 12 cfm at 50 psi, not for a less than 2hp
compressor.  The gun looks very nice, forged aluminum body, anodized,
nice quality on all machined parts.  I can't wait to try, and if it
actually improves transfer and reduces overspray I'm happy, the
environment was not my concern.  Oh as I'd had some input on HVLP
laying down dry layers, I ordered mine with the slightly larger 1.6
mm fluid tip set.
