Hi all-

In travelling thru Willits (today No. Cal) I checked out a lead my buddy
billie turned me onto.  This guy must have had at least 20 splits in his yard,
no shit.  Everything from 56 up to 67, trucks to deluxes.  Everywhere I looked
there was a splittie.   Its something to see.  I thought my yard was bad.
Unfortunately I did not have a camera to take some pics for you all.  Next
weekend I will be passing thru the area again and take pics to share online.
I believe a lot of themn are for sale.  The guy is active in the local club,
shows and I know some of the enthusiests in the Bay Area know about the place
as they have bought from him.   He is just kinda off the beaten path.  I will
see what is for sale, take pics and share as I told him I would.  The only bus
I was interested in is this 50's kombi that has never had a bath.  This thing
was moss from head to toe.  I have dreams of taking this thing to shows and
winning the &quot;dirtiest&quot; bus award.  Of course I will have to keep it
watered.......   :)

More later.
