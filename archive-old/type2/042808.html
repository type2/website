Amy,
You have opened a Pandora's Box of answers, here's mine:
If I had just purchased a 27 year-old vehicle, I'd want to look over the 
tune-up history to start with. When were the plugs last changed and the 
points set (or better changed), and the timing set. If not within the past 
5k miles by a competent person, I'd do it. Also the carb idle adjustment air 
screw(s) could be out of adjustment and that could cause rough idle.
But another clue to your problem is that it is coupled with running hot. 
This may be indicative of air leaking into the intake manifold thru a 
cracked/disconnected air line to the manifold (a so-called vacuum leak) or a 
loose fitting device on the manifold (such as the nuts that secure the 
carburetor(s) to the manifold. If such a leak occurs, the engine will both 
idle roughly, and if sufficiently large cause the mixture of air and fuel to 
be lean which causes overheating.
So I'd inspect all the fittings of hoses to the manifold, follow the hoses 
to their termini and see that they aren't cracked along the way, and that 
they are tightly fit at the far end. You can even check for air leaks by 
getting the engine running with the aid of a little bit of throttle (in case 
it won't idle alone), and then take a spray can of carburtetor cleaner with 
a plastic straw fitted to it (or for a bit more fire safety use WD-40, 
though a tiny squirt of cleaner will not start a fire), and then squirt each 
hose at its fitting to the manifold and at its terminus, and the base of the 
carburetor(s) and any other devices attached to the manifold. When one is 
leaking air, the engine idle will momentarily rise as the cleaner is sucked 
into the manifold. To do this test the engine muxt be idling fast enough to 
be turning at a constant speed, so you can notice the momentary speed- up.
Good luck on getting it back to proper operation.
Roland Finston
P.S.: The waste heat will not be fed back into the engine if you aren't 
using the heater; it is dumped out no matter.
