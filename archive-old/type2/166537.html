Since it is almost always only #3 it could be running lean, possibly 
from a vacuum leak. Have you tried spraying something volatile around 
the manifold while the engine is running? eg. starter fluid, WD40, 
propane. When you hit the leak the revs will rise as the lean 
condition is temporarily corrected. My other favourite is to remove 
the spark plug leads one at a time while the engine is running. If 
any of the cylinders is not &quot;pulling its weight&quot; the drop in revs 
will be less when you remove the lead from that cylinder. In the 
worst case, the revs don't change at all! (or so I'm told. Never seen 
it myself. Mumble, mumble...).

Martin.
