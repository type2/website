Michael,

The tubes from the fan to the heater boxes do NOT have any asbestos.  As
Richard said earlier, there is (or was)  asbestos in the heater boxes and
in the flex tube collars from the heater box to the body.  That is all
there is, AFAIK, and it is a hard pad.  I don't worry about it.  any loose
fibers went away 20+ years ago, as long as you don't play with it.

If you want to be paranoid, Ron (busdepot) or any VW parts source will
sell you heater boxes and bushings, but it will be $500+
