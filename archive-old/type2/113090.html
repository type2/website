Subject: Re:[T2] Cylinder 3 Exhaust Burnout Help.

Greg, this is not a burned valve, it must be a broken part 
(valve/spring/guide/valve seat)
Remove the valve cover and look carefully at the #3 rocker assembly! Is it loose, 
very loose, broken. Remove this one (rocker) and see if the spring is loose or broken.

How do you know that #3 is not firing?

Get under that bus and check everything, including push rod, and pushrod tube.

Let us know, Ben

Well, I do believe my third cylinder exhaust valve burned out.  
After a recent valve adjustment I noticed it was real tight, about 002., 
I set it back to .006 and she seemed to run fine.  
Today I was driving her and first a slight tapping, then a huge pop, 
and I was only firing on three Cylinders.  She did get me home though.  
I read John Muir and I am pretty sure this is what happened?  
Any advice on what to do  or what to inspect as I ready for this repair? 
 
Thanks,
