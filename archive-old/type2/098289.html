Subject: Re: [T2] '78 Westy FI

Hello again,
        Thanks for the answers. I did a compression test that was 125,
125, 131 and 126 respectively. The pressure regulator is 38 lbs.with the
vacuum hose removed and plugged and 30 lbs. with the vacuum hose on.
Bentley says at 28 lbs a valve is uncovered and excess gas returns to the
tank. Is the pressure regulator bad? I have removed the cold start valve
and injectors and looked for leakage but they seem to be ok. That might
be a false test since my pressure is not staying up. Also the temp sensor
2 is reading 2690 when motor has not been started and weather temperature
is about 65 degrees, the colder the weather the higher it reads. Is this
normal.
        TIA
        Ralph 78 westy
