Just thought I'd throw this to the masses.  As I type this my son is out =
sanding down the luggage rack fiberglass portion of or 71 westy and it =
is really looking good.  The luggage rack brackets or tie downs I took =
of are really rusty and was wondering if anyone had a source for =
replacements
Also need pads for the fold down seat and jump seat.
Finally, I have the engine compartment just about done though I have a =
large circular hole where the gas heater vented out and also ( it was a =
factory gas heater install) have a gap in my fire wall after I removed =
the gas heater.  Any suggestions on filling the holes or open gaps.
Steve
