Subject: Re: [T2] Strange problem

Hi Eric,

I think Rick caught the culprit.. the FI system on the vanagon can be 
very sensitive to vacuum  leaks. Sounds to me like you have a leaking 
power brake booster.

Or else it might be a relay or buzzer under the dash. The sound from 
some of the buzzers on my Dad's vanagon might be described as 
&quot;hissing&quot;. Sort of.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Over the past several days, my 80 Vanagon has been producing a strange

&gt; column. This has been most noticeable when starting and stopping the
&gt; engine. It has also been getting longer and louder.
