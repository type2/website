Subject: Re: [T2] chopped bus, no title, HELP ME!!!


I'm not sure where you live but there are generally people who will come
and haul away scrap cars for free. Look in the phone book. I have gotten
rid of a few wrecked cars this way even busses without suspensions.

fellow airheads,

 heres the situation, i have a 71 westy, which i
purchased for 60 bucks. it was so far gone that i
simply chopped it. i actually sold many of the parts
to listees. however now i need the garage space for my
76 westy. i have no title for the vehicle, the lady
said she would find it and contact me (yeah, like that
even happened!) at any rate, i just want this bus
gone, out of my life!!! i will give it to anyone who
wants it, i would even pay someone to get it the h#ll
away! short of that however, i am seeking advice as to
what the most painless rought would be to disposing of
this no longer fun or useful bus. thanks in adavance
as always!!
