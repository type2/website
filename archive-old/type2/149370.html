Subject: Tale of the tell tale heart

Really.  Last night I went out to my '76 Safare (with all the goodies EXCEPT 
a CLOCK!!) to check the fuel level.  With the way fuel is going now-a-days, 
$2.22 is a bargain, and I wanted to top off all my vehicles before it got 
higher.

I turned the ignition on but I did not start it.  I waited a bit until the 
gas gauge settled in, and I confirmed that fuel level with the miles since 
my last fill up.  4 gals down.

Then I noticed the EGR idiot light, along with the oil and battery idiot 
light, showing bright.  Well, not exactly solid bright, but it seemed that 
they were 'pulsing', like a very slight heart beat.  Probably going close to 
60 BPM, but perhaps slightly faster.

Nuts...  My Safare has a heartbeat!!  It's alive....

I hope this is something electrical, or electromechanical, and I will 
stopwatch time the pulses tonight and compare the series to a non-existing 
clock, or to the emergency flasher, or what ever you all might suggest.

But I am not planning to sleep alone in the '76 Safare until I find out.
