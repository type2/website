Subject: Re: [T2] '71 Safare for sale!  Dallas area

[...]
Sorry, I botched the year of the bus in the subject line... it is a 1971 model.

&gt;This sounds like a really nice bus.  I haven't seen it yet but here are 
&gt;the details:
&gt;
&gt;1971 Safare Custom Camper (this would be one of the first Safare's made)
&gt;Light blue with highroof
&gt;Sink/Stove/Fridge standard Safare layout (see my owners manual for 
&gt;pictures http://www.type2_dot_com/des/vw/bluto/manual/)
&gt;Rebuilt &quot;Strictly Foreign&quot; 1776 engine with 7k miles
&gt;California bus - no cancer but some light surface rust around bumpers, etc..
&gt;Price is $3,500 O.B.O.
&gt;Call 214-623-8633
&gt;
&gt;These busses are rare, especially outside of California.  By my estimate 
&gt;there were less than 1,500 Safare campers made and of those only a 
&gt;fraction are still on the road.  I would be willing to go check out this 
&gt;bus in person if anyone is seriously interested - it is about 25 miles 
&gt;from my house.
