It's been too serious of a week, with Ron of Bus Depot getting beaten up and
all.  Actually, every time I have ordered from Ron, I received my parts a
day or two before I really expected them.  Thanks, Ron.

Shawn is an Environmental Engineer in podunk Mississippi.  Wow, didn't know
there were any here.  Knew he was an engineer, but not what kind.  I guess
you and the other Environmental engineer in the state (if there is one) have
lots to talk about.  Mississippi is a glorious state to own a bus in.
Though there's not a bunch of them around, but when you do find one, its
fairly cheap, and doesn't have much rust.  Antique tags are dirt cheap,and a
one time buy.  Emission testing?  What's that.  Oil reclamation center?


Emission testing:  Whether or not the state trooper can read your tag number
through the smoke.

Emission standard:  Whether or not he can read it though the smoke at 50
feet.

Oil reclamation center:  That gulley out behind the gas station.

Spray booth:  That other garage out behind where the mechanics work that
white mist is usually billowing out of.  There are always lots of big
puddles of dried paint around it, too.

Hazardous waste:  A big baby's diaper.

Hazardous waste disposal site:  That big ditch on the gravel road about a
mile from town.

MSDS:  I dunno.

EPA:  Them yankees from Washington that come and pick on the local cabinet
shops every now and then.  They don't like the two foot tall piles of
sawdust around the saws.  Also, see spray booth.

OSHA:  What a preacher says when he stubs his toe.

Respirator:  A blue bandanna tied around your face.  They seem to catch more
paint than the red ones.

Company Environmental Officer:  That real smart guy that works out on the
assembly line that got a &quot;B&quot; in high school chemistry.  He nearly graduated,
if he hadn't gotten his head bashed in by that mule's hoof and all.

Sorry for the off topic posting.  Just thought things were a little too
serious.
