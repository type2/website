&gt; I bought a new EMPI carburetor for my '70 deluxe's new Dual Port 1600.

&gt; There are two vacuum ports on the carburetor, One on the front by the idle
&gt; adjustment screw and one on the side above the mixture adjustment screw. The
&gt; one on the front is much larger than the one on the side.

If it is like the conventional Solex carburator, the one on the left side
is the vacuum port for a single vacuum distributor.

The one on the rear (RIR) is for the decelertion valve/dual vacuum setup.
