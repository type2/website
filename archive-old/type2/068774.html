Martha,

Thanks anyway! When you get them, I'd appreciate it if you could send me
any manufacturer/distributor info from the box. I just realized I have a
customer in Holland, maybe if I gave him this info he could find them and
send us a shipment. Thanks again and stay warm!

good spirit,

tony

&gt; I WISH I had a way of doing this, believe me.  I have 3 more coming
&gt; in, but only due to the good graces of a friend who'll be visiting
&gt; here soon, and is willing, thank goodness to hand carry them in
&gt; her luggage, about which she's already began to complain bitterly.
&gt; Wish I had a solution, but the only thing I can think of is
&gt; to find a friend or relative in Germany and beg.  :)
