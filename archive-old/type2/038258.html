Subject: Accelerator Cable replacement -- how do you know when it's right?

Accelerator cable broke on my '76 the other day (crowded street, heavy
traffic, me dressed for an interview with leather soled shoes with zero
traction... ever push a bus with shoes that don't grip?), have the cable
replaced but I'm curious how you know when it's right ...

I threaded the new cable into the tube with plenty-o-grease and have it
connected to the throttle positioner, I held the cable end with pliers
to maintain tension but the pedal still feels somewhat &quot;mooshy&quot; -- is
this correct?

Any of you sages out there have any extra sage advice to dispense?
THANKS!!
