Guys, it's been really great corresponding with you all, but I just got
a new job working as a technology instructor at the university I
attended. I'm really excited about it and expecting to be putting in
long hours from here on out. So, with that said, I'm afraid I will not
have time to be on the list.

I still have my Bus, and will always have it most likely. By the way, I
got it up and running. Put on a new starter and it's fine now. Chris, if
you read this, I'd still like that relay though. :)

Thanks for all your help over these past few months!
