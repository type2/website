About 25% of the heat value of the fuel is realized as power at the
wheels.

This isn't as bad as it seems.  The absolute best power stations get
efficiences of about 40%, and they don't have to be light enough to move
themselves around.

The reason that you can't have 100% efficiency is because you have to move
heat into the engine, which means the engine has to be cooler than the
heat input temperature.  To cool the engine you have to move heat out and
throw it away.  That's the second law of thermodynamics.
