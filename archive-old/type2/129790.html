&gt;getting the flare right is a PITA IMHO.

Use 2 wrenches to do the bending, line is cheap if you have a steep 
learning curve. Just don't be in a hurry or you'll kink it and then need 
another of those cheap steel lines.
Get a double flare kit, they are cheap &amp; not hard to use.
Replacing metal brake lines is not hard, getting the bleeder open might be 
hard...
