Subject: Mexican Bus Parts

I just came back from Cancun (bizness) and all of those 1600 bay window
busses made me wonder if beetlemex deals parts for these as well as they
have new sliding side windows and how about those seals that were so hard
to get for the side window with vent? and prob many others I haven't
thought of.
Inquisitive.
