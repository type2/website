Subject: RE: ideas to keep the bus

	The Club is not bad, a hidden kill switch is not bad. A locking
engine compartment lid is very good. Don't forget a locking gas-cap if 
the flap doesn't lock.
	Don't leave your bus in a dark area near a busy street. Sadly, a lot 
of car theft is done by your neighbors or their kids or their kids friends. 
Luckily, busses aren't the objects of desire that Camaros, Accords,
etc, are. However, not all theves want high profile wheels. Not
all theves are very smart either.
	In 1978 or 9 my wife's 1963 Dodge station wagon was stolen- from
the parking area next to the gas station where it was to be worked on
the next morning. The thief was apprehended within hours of the theft,
because he could not remove the locked gas cap to refill it- and his
attempts, at the side of a road in the middle of the night, attracted
the attention of a passing policeman. The sucka went to jail and
stayed there at least until the trial, as he was wearing an orange
jump suit and handcuffs when I testified at his trial.
