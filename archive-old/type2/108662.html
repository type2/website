Subject: a timing versus carburetor dilemma -- dead at idle

Hello, All!

I just finished installing a rebuilt engine into the '71 Type 2 that I
purchased, non-operable, in May. It's my first VW, and my first time taking
on a project like this. (Just another example of girls kicking butt -- but
what else are you going to do when you're unemployed?)

We (one female housemate, one male friend) turned her over for the first
time a week ago. (BLISS!!!) The thing is, we can't get her to idle on her
own. I've picked through the many articles in the library to help resolve
this, just as I have with many problems before getting this far, but this
time I have run up against a wall.

Everyone says to adjust your timing before adjusting the carburetor. The
trouble is, in order to adjust her timing (her name is Alice), she has to be
idling -- and she's very likely to be way off because it's a new engine.
What to do, what to do???

I am very eager for suggestions on this: myself, my boyfriend, and the
vehicle are due to head out to the Burning Man festival (over 300 miles each
way) in A WEEK AND A HALF. (Yipe!)

In addition to advice, we're also looking for a good diagram of the Solex 34
Pic-3 carb she's got in her. Complete, exploded views online would be most
helpful.

Thanks!
