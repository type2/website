&gt; Here's my procedure for checking a module.  I hope others will confirm/deny.
&gt;
&gt; The only job of the module is to simulate the action of the points.
&gt; This action can be checked by connecting a voltmeter from the -
&gt; terminal of the coil to ground.
&gt;
&gt; When the points are open, whatever voltage is present at the +
&gt; terminal of the coil should also be present at the - terminal,
&gt; because no current is being drawn, so no voltage drop exists across
&gt; the primary. That voltage should be battery voltage = 12V.
&gt;
&gt; When the points close, the voltage at the - terminal should be zero
&gt; because that terminal is now grounded. In my experience, this value
&gt; is not zero but is a fraction of a volt. Since current is now flowing
&gt; in the primary, perhaps there is a voltage drop somewhere to give
&gt; this non-zero value.

stays at constant 12volts.....when cranking, but I can't get the coil to
throw a spark when manually simulating a set of points either


I'm getting more confused by the moment
