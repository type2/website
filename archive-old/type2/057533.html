Subject: Westfalia Poptop Cleaning

I know this has been discussed several times in the past, but I figure
stuff like this is always useful to new folks as well as us
list-veterans with bad memories.

I cleaned my poptop this past weekend for the 2nd time in 8 years.  It
had gotten very dingy and most of it had turned an ugly, splotchy grey.
Even the high-pressure spray and the foaming brush at the car wash
wouldn't do the trick.

So I trundled off to my local discount hardware store and bought some
X-14 cleaner.  It's sold for cleaning mold and mildew in your shower and
should be stocked right next to things like Tilex.  This stuff works
GREAT for cleaning poptops!  The dinginess on your poptop is usually
just mold, mildew, and bird crap stains anyway.

Just spray the stuff liberally on to a dry roof and use a bathtub or
kitchen scrub brush to scrub it.  I use a stepladder and can reach about
1/3 of either side of the roof at a time.  I did 1/2 of the roof then
rinsed it and dried it then did the other half.  Used the whole bottle
of X-14.  My roof is so damned bright now it hurts my eyes to look at
it.
