I think it's more likely that you guides are bad, not your seals.

A quart of oil every 600 miles is a lot of pollution.  If it were me, and I 
had the money, I'd make sure it was head related (compression check with and 
without oil) and do the right thing.

As far as a compression tester goes get the cheapest one that will work, 
you're only going to use it a few times.

A top end rebuild IMHO consists of pulling the engine, removing the tin, 
cleaning the engine, pulling the heads, and taking them to a good machinist.  
I'd also replace the flywheel end crankshaft seal.
