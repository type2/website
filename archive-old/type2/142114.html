Subject: Crazy Ray and Hydraulic-jack parts

1) Noted posts on the 1968 Bay at Crazy Ray's boneyard.  Their Erdman av 
location tells me to call 410-354-4800 to get the address of their yard in 
Curtis Bay, on Hawkins Point.  No answer, no info available on the tel# from 
switchboard_dot_com -- any info easily on hand ??

2) Also noted, &quot;.._dot_used to have a Hein-Warner floor jack, was big $$$ when I 
bought it new..... it also blew its seals internally.&quot;  

I would love to find parts for BLACKHAWK.  Even if not economic, I would fix 
for sentimental reasons -- the Blackhawk saved my butt in some SCCA crew 
activities.  Any recomm of sources for seal kits??  

Thanx!  p-mail me at.....  mccomas (at) intercom (dot) net
