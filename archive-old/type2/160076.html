&gt; Ah yest- reminds me of the time I was visiting Tony Roman in NJ and
&gt; managed to get a rope or bungee caught around the steering wheel gap and
&gt; the horn started to sound continuously- had to yank the horn wire.
&gt; Turns out it had bent one of those copper/brass leaves in half- simply
&gt; bent it back.
&gt; 
   Ah yest - Lookin' in my rear view mirror an' there's Mike, in the middle
of an intersection an' his horn's blowing like mad an' I'm lookin' for some
place to pull over an' see what's wrong... ;-)
