hello....I just subscribed to this list today for one reason....I am
purchasing a 1971 VW bus....it is a hardtop westy in great
condition....all of the paint (except for a very small amount) is
perfect....the interior is great...it has a sink, bench seat/bed...and
two seats in front.  It also has the original motor with 61,000 miles on
it.  it is orange and white on top...original paint.....I was wondering
what this bus is worth, and where i could get the following parts, and
how much they'd be...approx...I need new tires, heat exchangers, and a
muffler.

Is this bus rare in any way?  I haven't seen too many hardtop westys out
there...especially 71's....thanks!  oh yeah...its in wisconsin too!

Thanx again!
Punkerbat
Isaiah
