&gt; These sound like the ideal thing to have at a bus event. Let people listen to

&gt; difference would be if you got an AM one? I figured that the AM stations might
&gt; have less chance of trampling on someone else's signal. Is their any real
&gt; difference in the sound quality between AM and FM when used in such a small
&gt; area?

I haven't seen AM versions of these sold.  One problem with the AM is that
the frequency is much lower (1.0 MHz vs. 100MHz) requiring an antenna
about 100 times as big.  Those big tall towers at AM radio stations aren't
there to support the antenna, they _are_ the antenna!

Now, you probably could get around this, but FM produces a nice clean
localized signal.  No sense stepping backwards into AM!
