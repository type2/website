&gt; Regarding the burning bus. One idea to limit the size of the fire would be to
&gt; run your fuel pump power through a piece of that Safety Kleen meltable wire,
&gt; or maybe even solder that is strung across the engine room. That way if a fire
&gt; gets going it will melt the wire, killing the fuel pump. limiting the size of
&gt; the fire, cutting off the forced airflow feeding it, and informing the owner
&gt; there is a problem by killing the engine;-)

Only problem here is that solder is not a real good conductor; it would heat
up in normal use and could melt--meaning a ziplock baggie of pre-made solder
jumpers in the glove box would be as necessary a Bus spare part as is a
clutch cable.

This would work, though: hook up the fuel pump with a push-on connector in
the line. Put a spring on the push-on and tie it in the &quot;pushed-on&quot; position
with solder or safety-kleen wire (use the same spring to set off your fixed
fire suppression system if you have one). The wire melts, the power to the
fuel pump goes away, and the fire bottle discharges.
