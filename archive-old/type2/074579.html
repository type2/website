&gt; Do hydraulic lifters really go bad?....please don't revisit the solid vs

Dave:
Yours are probably not bad. If it doesn't quiet down soon, just tighten it a
little more and drive it a few thousand miles, then readjust it. I've had to
do this a couple of times. They may get air in them.
On my 80 Vanagon engine(a really tortured, convoluted story)  that I just
started driving in September, I let the guy that works for me set the lifters.
(He's an old VW guy for  the last 25 years, but not very experienced with
hydraulics.) Later I heard from another guy that works for me that he thought
I'd not be happy with how he did it. (Didn't have the guts to tell me to my
face!)
When I took off the valve covers, I was shocked to see that the screws were
screwed damn near all the way in!
I went through the setting procedure and found they were an average of 5-1/2
turns down from no lash! And the thing ran fine for a couple of thousand
miles!
So, apparently they have a lot of travel in them.
