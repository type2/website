Well, it was not the exhaust system or the heat exchangers that was causing my 78 Westy , 2.0L FI engine to start, run a little then, when letting off the gas, she dies. We just got all the exhaust system and all back on and started it up.. ran fine for a few minutes. drove it around the parking lot, and it died.. finally started back up, pulled back into parking place and when I let up on the excellerator, it died and coasted into the parking place.  It does not have, and did not have before all this started and we have put about 20,000 miles on it in the past year, does not have an EGR system. and it ran fine without it before.  Any suggestions? Would the #3 temp sensor cause this if it was loose?
Thanks in advance...
