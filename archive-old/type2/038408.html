Keep in mind that earlier bay window buses can be upgraded to disks pretty
easily.  It's a bolt-on mod.  Likewise, late disks can be retrofitted to
any bay model by swapping spindles, calipers, and disks.

&gt; Of the upright motored busses, the 71 was probably the &quot;best&quot;, seeing as it
&gt; had the disks up front. Of the pancakes motored bussessess, I'd probably go
&gt; with a 2-liter (76 and up?), due to the higher final gearing. Then I'd go
&gt; looking for a Carerra motor... but that's a Friday thing.

I love my '71 but any nice bus is a good buy!
