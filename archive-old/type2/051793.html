Subject: [T2] engine hatch support rollers

Volks,

I should probably be saving these for a whatzit, but someone out there
needs them, so I am posting instead.  Someone asked Nikki to look for the
rollers that hold the engine hatch in the raised position.  The ones that 
travel in that wire loop on the right side of the hatch.  Well, Nikki and
I found some last time I was in CA, then I put the $#$^ things in my
pocket and brought them back here to VA.  I don't know who it was, but
could you please get in touch with me and I will mail them out?
