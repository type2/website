Subject: 70 Westy help

Hi Volks,

I am getting ready to start working on my '70 westy.  I tried to figure
out the m-codes and got what info was available.  The exterior color is
#5233 which I believe is Titian Red.  What would be the interior cab
upholstery color have been? I have #31 m-code but can't figure out what
it is.  Can anyone help?  Thanks.

Jamie
