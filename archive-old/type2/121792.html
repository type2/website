Subject: Re: [T2] Replace 75 F.I. with 78 Looking for parts

Hi Tom,

I wouldn't hurry to blame the AFM or ECU for low oil pressure. Have you 
tried a different Oil pressure gauge or sender? Have you tried a 
cylinder heat temp gauge on the engine?  Lean running will show on a 
CHT gauge much quicker than with an oil pressure or temp gauge. You 
also need to make sure that EVERYTHING else is accounted for: All tin 
is in place, the right oil is being used, no vacuum leaks, the oil 
cooler is unrestricted, foam engine seal and internal cooling flaps in 
place, etc, etc.

&lt;Flame Suite Initializing....&gt;

If you read the Bosch manual carefully you will find that the L-Jet FI 
was designed to meter fuel to airflow. A 2L engine pulls 10% more air 
than the 1.8L, so the AFM will tell the ECU to hold the injectors open 
10% longer. This will continue to occur until the engine reaches wide 
open throttle or the injectors reach 100% utilization. Since the 1.8L 
engine and 2L share the same injectors,  intake plenum, etc I would 
expect that this hypothetical limit would fall outside regular 
operating RPMS (ie, above WOT).

If someone with a tach can verify the RPMs at WOT of  a 1.8L engine, we 
can be reasonably assured that a 2L engine with a 1975 FI system can 
operate safely at 90% of this range.  If the recommended RPM limit of a 
2L and 1.9L engine are the same I would infer that the limit is due to 
mechanical factors rather than FI capacity. I don't have this data at 
the moment, but would be interested in seeing it if someone has it 
available.

Another point some people forget to include in their analysis is that 
the transmission used in a 2L bus has a final drive ratio 5% higher 
than the 1.8L buses were equipped with. This extra efficiency changes 
the 90% of WOT RPM range upwards to 95%.  My assumption here is that VW 
increased the gear ratios to decrease RPM's, and keep the fuel flow 
requirements within the capabilities of the L-Jet's capacity. Whether 
or not this was a design goal is a moot point; it still serves to 
lessen the impact of installing a 1.8L FI on a 2L engine.

In my book, 95% of WOT is close enough. VW would have to have 
engineered in some over-run available to compensate for down-shifting, 
decellerating on hills, etc. Other factors (in particular, driving 
style and maintenance intervals) are going to have a far higher impact 
than the origin of the FI.

Quick fact: Anyone who regularly drives their bus at 95% of WOT for 
extended periods needs to think about a different vehicle. Or adjust 
the maintenance interval and start saving up for regular cylinder head 
replacement.

Note: I didn't design the Bosch FI. But I have read the specs, and the 
details are there if you want to read them. How you interpret and use 
that information is up to you.

Happy trails,

&gt; My 75 bus has a 78 engine but still using the 75 fuel injection. It
&gt; seems to run hot and the oil pressure goes down in relation to the 
&gt; temp.
&gt; When first started in 30 degree weather it will pump 65 psi oil 
&gt; pressure
&gt; but quickly warms to 180 deg. oil temp (sensor is in the sump plate
&gt; under the dip stick). Oil pressure will drop to 25 to 30 psi at this
&gt; temp. I suspect the engine is running lean because the Fuel injection
&gt; was designed for the smaller 1800 instead of the 2000 that's in there. 
&gt; I
&gt; have replaced all vacuum lines and find no leaks. I have installed a 
&gt; new
&gt; oil pump about 1000 miles ago with only a slight  improvement. After
&gt; removing the old pump I found only slight wear. The engine was rebuilt
&gt; 2000 miles ago and hopefully I measured everything accurately.
&gt;
&gt; I am considering upgrading to the 78 fuel injection to see if this
&gt; improves the oil temp. I have many of the parts from the 78 f.i. but am
&gt; missing the air flow meter and ECU. I also don't know if things like 
&gt; the
&gt; double relay and vapor recovery stuff will work with the 78 f.i.
