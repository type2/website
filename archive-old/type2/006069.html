&gt;Any listmember in need of 185/75R-14 (passenger--not bus or van) can have
my
&gt;used ones for $10/ea. They (4ea-a set) have less than 1,000 mi. on them
with
&gt;two having less than 300 miles. Plus I have a 5th tire in excellent
&gt;condition for free. All sold as a set. You can have all five for less than
&gt;the cost of one!! Listmembers only.
&gt;
&gt;P-mail if interested. I'm located in Billings, MT. If nearby--stop by and
&gt;pick them up. Will consider shipping but will add to cost of tires.
