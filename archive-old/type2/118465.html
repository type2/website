Subject: Dedicated accessory circuit

I am interested in installing a dedicated accessory circuit in my 72
Campmobile, utilizing a secondary battery.  Has anyone had experience with
this kind of thing?  The archives made no reference,and I'm wondering if the
stock alternator would be enough to keep both batteries charged.  Since I
understand that alternators only work at about half capacity in a normal mode,
I wonder if having an inline switch would be a suitable answer to that problem
or if I would need to acquire an alternator with higher output capacity.  Any
help would be appreciated.

Cheers,
