Subject: Re: [T2] shifter adjustment and tank hose replacement

I found the source of the gas fumes. I put installed a new filler neck 
when I redid the tank. When I dumped gas in the filler hole it was 
leaking from around the base of the new filler neck. The clamp must not 
have seated correctly. The fuel would run down to the hose between the 
tank and filler pipe leading me to think it was bad. I loosend the clamp 
up made sure the pipe was seated and retightened it. No more leak.
As for the bumper, it was NOT a stab at the vendor it came from I use 
them all the time. It was a stab at aftermarket parts in general. Don't 
get me wrong though,if I couldn't find a good used the flimsy ones would 
be on my bus too. All done sniffing gas fumes for now.

&gt;Bill,

&gt;Gas fumes a can find a spark a ruin your day or even kill you, so for sure
&gt;have your battery disconnected and work in a ventilated place (not a windy
&gt;one though) a calm cool spring Connecticut day usually does the trick. I
&gt;stick a plastic bag over the open fuel pipes.
&gt;
&gt;I got a 5 1/4 inch long piece with the tank end cut at an angle this will
&gt;help get all the hose on the tank outlet. I just pulled the cover off and
&gt;leaned it back. i.e. remove the air intake boot and unplug the double relay
&gt;and voltage regulator. I would also loosen the filler neck from the body
&gt;(completely, did you get a new one). Wet the inside of the hose (rubbing
&gt;alcohol works the best), slide the new tube over the filler pipe just to
&gt;where the stock one was and then slide the hose clamps on facing in the
&gt;right direction, then work the other end onto the tank with the short side
&gt;toward you. This compensates for the bend. Work the hose all the way to the
&gt;flange on the tank then work the other end further onto the filler pipe
&gt;until the hose is close to the right spot. Pulling the filler neck into the
&gt;correct position will put as little stress on the filler neck elbow as
&gt;possible. Tighten the hose clamps. Yard on the pipe and the new hose to make
&gt;sure its snug.
&gt;
&gt;Adjusting the shifter,
&gt;
&gt;loosen the stop plate and bracket under bracket. then put the trans in
&gt;second gear. Slide the stop plate left (towards driver side) until it stops
&gt;resting against the rod and the bottom part of the lever is in plane with
&gt;the center line of the bus. The stop plate is just under the bracket flange
&gt;and can be moved independent of the bracket with a flat head screw driver.
&gt;
&gt;Glad to here you like the bumper, original used means OEM and that can be
&gt;better than new reproductions.

&gt;
&gt;Joe,
&gt;You have a good memory. I did try and use a section of hose from Napa. I
&gt;could not get it to make the bend
&gt;without it bunching up around the tank end. How long of a piece did you
&gt;use? Maybe I'll try it again. Did you have to drop
&gt;the engine a little to get the cover back on over the gas tank? As for
&gt;the tranny I replaced all the bushings and was just
&gt;looking for some tips to get the shift lever adjusted right. Do you
&gt;remember the bumper I bought off you? I had the chance to
&gt;see some new ones from ******* and WOW what a difference in thickness.
&gt;I tease my buddy that bought it that I see it flap
&gt;in the wind when he drives. Hope business is doing well.
