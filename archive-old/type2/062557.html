So I wrote:
That's odd Robert. Could it be leaking from near the base of the dipstick tube?
There should be a little rubber collar covering where the base of the dipstick
inserts into a flared, conical hole into the crankcase. You could see it by 
lying underneath the bus and looking up next to the engine support bar on
the passenger side. The rubber piece is about 1.5 inches long. On mine, the 
fit is kind of losse and I've always wondered that there seems to be no
hose clamp called for in the manuals.Anyway, if dipstick fits improperly
into crankcase, or if rubber is missing, torn, or misplaced, you might leak
from there. I replaced rubber for a very few bucks from VW parts dept. of local
dealer.
  
Only other thing I can think of is that engine might be badly overfilled with 
oil? Or dipstick is improperly inserted into tube?

Good luck,
Surfer Bob
