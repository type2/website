I have been watching these tire threads for months and
nobody has mentioned Cooper tires.  I have been
running
the Discoverer LT series tires (195/75-14) for over
40K now and really like them a lot.  I have had
occasion to use them in about every type of terrain
you might want to drive your bus through.  Living in
the PNW lots of rain/snow/mud and sand they have
worked quite well.  I paid 320.00 for the set just shy
of two years ago and about the only issue I have had
is some minor cupping until I dialed in the tire
pressure.

Here is a link to the specs page:

&gt; I just got off the phone with Tirerack and they say
&gt; that is a miskey. The
&gt; salesman says the load is probably 1469Lbs rather
&gt; then 2469Lbs. I think
&gt; he's still wrong since the Aegis LS4 is 1532Lbs for
&gt; that size (205/75-14).
&gt; He couldn't find it in his yokohama book and it's
&gt; not listed on the
&gt; yokohama website.
&gt; 
&gt; Seems like the best deal in that size is the
&gt; Goodyear marathon Radial Load
&gt; Range C for $62 or you can go with the stock size
&gt; (185/0-14) Yokohama Y356
&gt; Load Range C for $50
&gt;
