Hi, all-

Quick question-

I have this 34PICT Weber, needs to be rebuilt.  Anyone know the
procedure for bringing this thing into tune afterwards?  I really
like this carb, it's just been sitting for way too long... Needs
a rebuild something awful.  I'm gonna use it because I'm fed up 
with the Solex, and I have not the money for the 2-bbl progressive
carb.  Also, any pointers would be appreciated!

Take It Easy,
