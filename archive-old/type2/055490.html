Subject: Re:  Black Bus Sitting

&gt;What is really weird about a black bus is the lack of visual definition.
 (snip)

	I fully agree with Jeff on this one!!  My '66 is an all black bus
(PO painted it).  I hate the color for the fore mentioned reason.  The
simple lines are what make a bus so attractive in the first place.  When
painted all black, there is NO definition or shadows of any kind to
highlight those sexy lines that make the bus so beautiful.  If you must
paint your bus black, I'd suggest a more traditional 2-tone in a
black/charcol or something of that nature so you don't totally drown out
the contours of your bus.  Besides, do you know how much work it is to
paint a bus (or anything else, for that matter) black and have it look
good?!?!  Mine was painted with less care then is required and it shows!!
 Some day I hope for a 2-tone grey - bottom w/ ivory - top &amp; interior;
2-tone stock wheels . . . (Pardon me while I wipe the drool from my face
&lt;G&gt;).
