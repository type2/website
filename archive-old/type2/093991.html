Subject: Re: [T2] one more time...shift mechanism housing...

[...]
Bentleys or haynes and follow the step by step procedures for aligning 
the shift mechanism.  The guide on the pax side is part of the box, the 
one on the drivers side is a rubber piece held on by screws or pins.  
They tell you how to measure the distance from side to side at which 
position of the stick. and how to create a gauge to measure with.   The 
link that i gave you on my tech site shows the parts breakout.

&gt; Hey jimt...
&gt; Thanks again for info...that's the answer I'm looking for...[front 
&gt; buffers help align for shifting]...now the question is ?...I do need 
&gt; both buffers?...I only have one mounted on the inside of the 
&gt; housing...I have the one that would be located on the passenger's side] 
&gt; ...one must have fallen off or broke off...and yes we did make another 
&gt; ajustment on the connection in the middle...we just don't know how the 
&gt; linkage fits on the buffers...and can I buy just one buffer? ...or do I 
&gt; need to buy the whole housing ?...
&gt; I just ordered from amazon_dot_com a book on VW's by Tom Wilson...I plan on 
&gt; doing alot of reading this winter :) ...
&gt; is there any diagram out there that would show me how the inside of the 
&gt; housing with the linkage's and the buffer's installed?...that's what I 
&gt; really need?
&gt; thanks again...just let me know when I'm becoming a pain in the butt...
