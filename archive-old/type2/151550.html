Subject: CV joints

Hi,

Any suggestions on how to assemble the CV-joints? I bought some new ones for
our '68-bus and while adding grease I unfortunately disassembled them. I
read the archives about the small and large intersections but the inner race
with the balls just doesn't want to fit in the outer race - the balls seem
to be too tight...

I would aprreciate some tips?

Bart
