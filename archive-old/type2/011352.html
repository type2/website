Subject: RE: Cold Start Hesitation Problem
Date: Tue, 1 Aug 2000 08:19:24 US/Mountain

&gt;My stock '77 FI has trouble starting when cold (though in Texas that means
&gt;around 100F).  When it catches it dies quickly unless I carefully give it
&gt;some gas.  Sometimes it won't catch unless I floor the pedal (type 1 no
&gt;choke trick).  After 10 seconds or so it runs GREAT.  I don't mind this but
&gt;someone buying it may.  I checked everything in the FI troubleshooter -
&gt;there's voltage at the cold start valve connector with respect to ground
&gt;when cranking.  The thermo time switch side of the cold start valve
&gt;connector shows 70ohms to ground.  My temp sensor reads around 900 ohms at
&gt;100F ambient (it's not shorted or open).  The only other thing I can think
&gt;to check is whether or not the cold start injector is clogged.  Does anyone
&gt;else have any ideas?  Thanks in advance!Christopher Darilek77 Westfalia

Your head temp sensor is reading pretty low for a cold motor (even if it is 100 
degrees outside).  You should be seeing readings in the upper teens (1800 - 
2000+).  It takes all of about 10 seconds for those readings to drop to around 
1000 OHMS and another 20 seconds to put it down in the low hundreds.  You can 
test this theory by temporarily putting a 1000 OHM resistor (obtained from 
local electronics supply store for about $0.69) between the sensor and the FI 
wiring harness.

Your cold start valve should not come into play unless the air temps are below 
about 35 degrees (this is based on my knowledge of D-jet FI, not L-jet so if 
it's different, someone please correct me).
