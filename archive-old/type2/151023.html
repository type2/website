Subject: Re: [T2] Instruments for testing an engine in the shop?

Gerald,

You did read the CHT writeup I did on Richards site?  Especially the part 
about the gauge must be level?....and how far off it was and gets?  
Richard also explains about *why* it is off and offers alternatives.

Alternatives...

http://www.autospeed_dot_com/shop/category_579/browse.html
see &amp;quot;High Range Adjustable Temperature Switch with LCD&amp;quot;
Notice that it reads up to 1200C

You might also pull the gauges you have and calibrate them in the oven and 
boiling water.

Remember that a mechanical oil pressure gauge will *not* work well over 
about 5 feet.

What is the fuel pressure gauge for?  If you just need a quick look while 
driving, just run a standard one inside via the access hatch and have 
someone drive while you watch.  Bentley specs the fuel pressure at vacuum 
on and vacuum off.


Cheers, dave

&amp;gt; I'm still not comfortable with how hot the Rivi &amp;quot;feels&amp;quot;. I'm going today
&amp;gt; to:
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; Hit a speed shop and buy:
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; A) Direct mount mech oil pressure guage 
&amp;gt; B) Fuel pressure guage 
&amp;gt; C) IR trigger thermometer
&amp;gt; 
snip
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; The CHT hit 400+ on that drive. BUT!!! I don't trust the CHT. It NEVER
&amp;gt; goes under 150 and when I got back in the Rivi last night to run to a
&amp;gt; (closer this time) burger joint the CHT was sitting at 350 when I got in.
&amp;gt; It dropped to 150 when I tapped on it.
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; So, I'm going to get the instruments I need to get accurate MECHANICAL
&amp;gt; readings rather than relying on the information transmitted to an
&amp;gt; electrical guage through 15+ feet of wire.
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; Any other suggestions for shop meters for testing engine health?
