Subject: Re: [T2] VW-themed license plate frames?

heh. I like that one. But it'd be a lie... My other car is a Volvo. :(

Have you checked the mall? There's almost always a place that custom makes
vinyl stickers. Swap meets/flea markets usually have them too.

My license plate is a vanity plate that I'm waiting for the DMV to stamp and
deliver: SH4RK. Of course I had to hunt down a shark themed license plate to
go with it, just like the one in this eBay auction:

except I bought mine at WalMart for $15.
