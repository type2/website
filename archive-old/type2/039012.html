Subject: Camping list, was &quot;Going Cross Country!!!&quot;

I know everyone has their own camping list, so here is mine.  This list has
evolved after many years of camping.

I always hated driving out of the driveway saying to myself, &quot;what is it I
am forgetting?&quot;.  Now with the list, I just check it and put my mind at
ease.  I know, I know, it's a teacher thing.

We have never camped in a Westy, this summer will be our first.  It will be
nice to just pop the top, then arrange the stuff in the bus for sleeping.

We have always camped out of a standard bus using tents.  We will take as
many tents as we needed for the number of people going along.  Nothing
wrong with using a standard bus, after all, if it is your daily driver,
which do you use most, a passenger vehicle, or camping?  Take out the
center seat and you have tons of room for all the gear listed below!  And
you MUST throw stuff up on the roof rack, just wrap it in a good tarp,
bungee it down good and it will stay pretty dry.

This list is for an extended trip, so add or subtract as need be to fit
your trip and tastes.
