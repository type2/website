&gt;I have a '77 van the engine of which I am rebuilding.  I have gotten the
&gt;heads on, and would like to add the lifters, but I have these awful long
&gt;'much bent wires' that go in under the lifters -- somehow.  I recall
&gt;trying to understand how they came out as I dissassembled, but wasn't
&gt;really able to see what they were doing.  what do they do, and can anyone
&gt;take a stab at explaning their routing?  What about their purpose in life?

The spring thingy is to keep the pushrod tubes from vibrating out.  There is
a left and a right one and they're not interchangeable.  The 4 flat parts of
the spring should sit against the bottom of each of the pushrod tubes and no
part of it should touch the pushrods.  If you put it on at the same time you
put on the rocker arm assemblies it goes pretty easy.  I'm not sure if you
can put it on if your rocker assemblies are already installed.

Hope this helps.
