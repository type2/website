Just a remark.

In Germany (and Holland) you will find that most people who own a (fairly)
new car have all the maintanance done by the 'official dealer'. Which means
that only factory provided or approved materials and procedures are used.
Independant workshops cater mostly for the second, third and fourthhand
vehicles. Chains like Napa, Midas etc hardly exist. Of course there are very
few mechanics, dealer or not, who still know about our beloved verhicles.
