Subject: fs; 1965 single cab, Cambridge ONT canada

I looked at a 1965 Single Cab today,, it is in pretty good shape... the owner
is asking $9500.00

it doesnt have the original gates,,, they have made up square tube gates on a
wood platform on top of the orig deck.

It has a 1600cc dual port,, apparently rebuilt.. as are every vw I have ever
seen that is for sale....

you can call and talk to him .. it is located at cheesefactory and maple manor
rd..  519-621 0628
new tel no as he just moved there,, the trader tel number is out of date
