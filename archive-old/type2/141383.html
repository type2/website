Subject: John Brown's Buses Update

What's John Brown's Buses you say?  Only the best damn VW Bus campout ever
held in historic Harper's Ferry West Virginia, that's all! Some history:
Founded a few years ago by bus fanatic Jamie Auch, it has become THE best fall
campout in the mid-Atlantic area. Jamie moved to N. Carolina this year though,
and not wanting to see this event die, Sharon Simpson and I have agreed to
co-host it and keep it going. This years event will be October 14-15-16, at
the same KOA campground in Harper's Ferry. This is a very nice campground with
lots of things to do-bike rentals, game room, movies, etc.-even Elvis himself
made an appearance one year! Forty sites are being set aside for this event,
so plan now to reserve yours. The phone numbers for the KOA are: 304-535-6895
or 800-562-9497. Their web address is: http://www.harpersferrykoa_dot_com.
When contacting the campground make absolutely certain the person understands
that you are with John Brown's Buses so that you will be reserved a site with
the group ( I've heard the campground is under new management and wasn't
familiar with the event). More info is also at the official JBB website at:
http://www.johnbrownsbuses_dot_com

Any other questions, please contact either Sharon (toby.gun_at_verizon_dot_net) or me
at fonman4277_at_earthlink_dot_net.
