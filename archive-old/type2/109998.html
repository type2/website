Subject: Re: [T2] 74 Westy airconditioning

&gt; From: &quot;gil hayes&quot; &lt;gilhayes_at_midsouth.rr_dot_com&gt;
&gt;&gt; I would like to know of souces for a/c...
&gt;
&gt; I know that these are almost, like, totally anathema, but just how do those
&gt; RV rooftop units work?  12v?  120v only?
&gt;
&gt; The only one that I've worked on, just to clean the housing for a friend,
&gt; seemed to be self contained.  As I was not interested in who it worked at
&gt; that time, I didn't think to ask him.

The only way to efficiently turn an AC compressor with a belt around the
crank. The alternator does not provide enough juice to turn an electric
compressor. You could load a 50hp generator in the bus and use it to power an
airconditioner - but that sort of defeats the idea of driving a bus...

It's a simple issue of the effort/power needed to run a compressor.
Theoretically, the newer rotary compressors only use a few hp to turn but even
a few hp require a good bit of wattage...
