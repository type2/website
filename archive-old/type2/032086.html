&gt; Is there something special I should know about jumping a fuel injected
&gt; bus? Just incase I need to jump it, I don't want to over load anything.

Someone made a joke of this, but he's asking a serious question and
derserves a serious answer. John Muir strongly cautions against ever
jumping a FI bus, saying you can fry the FI brain by so doing. But people
jump them all the time. I've jumped mine a dozen times or more with no
apparent problem. I have also asked VW mechanics about this before. One
said I should turn on some circuit in the bus (he recommended the heater
fan) before jumping. Said this would function as some sort of sink fo
rexcess voltage (if any) to keep it from frying anything important. I've
done it with and I've done it without and I've never had a problem.

Any comments from the knowledgeable on this list? Is there a danger? Could
turning on some other circuits before jumping reduce the risk?

Good luck,
