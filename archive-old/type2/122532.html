&gt; I've noticed that beetle fuel injectors ending in 116 seems to have the same

Yes.

And the hose on the beetle injectors (116) is pre-curved. I have a set in my
spares box. I have these exact injectors on a 2.0 bus engine and they work
perfectly. There are a great many bosch injectors with different part
numbers that will work, as long as you make the hoses fit correctly. Bosch
made injection systems for lots of cars and many of the core components are
identical across different applications. The only parts I would never
consider interchanging are the ECU and the AFM.
