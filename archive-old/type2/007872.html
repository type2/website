Hey Y'all,
  I was just looking a 'thesamba' web  page, great page lots of good 
stuff, and I saw a 70 Bus broshure with a sunroof bus pictured. It had a 
deflector on the front of the sunroof opening. Is this a factory option? 
Was it a standard piece that came with the Bus and has just been lost 
over the years or did you have to get it from VW? It looked like it was 
clear plastic or plexiglass.
  I also looked at the owners manual. It showed the engine having some 
light colored pullies. What was the original color? I have an engine out 
of a different year and its posible the tin and pullies are from a bug. 
I am trying to make it look as original as possible and it would help to 
know what color this stuff was in 1970.
  I have an original tool pouch but am missing a few of the tools. Any 
idea where to get replacments and how to tell if they go to a Bus or 
not?
  Thanks.
