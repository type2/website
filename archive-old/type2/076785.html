Subject: Free Bus - Greater Sacramento Area

I found a free bus.  It's a '77, non-running, but 
complete.  It's free, but you MUST get it tomorrow
or it goes to the great junkyard in the sky.  They
will NOT sell or give parts off of it - all or nothing.
It has all the seats, glass, etc.  It's actually a
nice bus, just hasn't run in a while.

The bus is complete, straight and dry except for a
good-sized dent in the middle of the driver's side.
It has a clean California title - saw the pink with
my own eyes.

It's in Rio Linda.

If you're serious about this car, please contact me offline
and I'll give you the contact info. 

Thom
