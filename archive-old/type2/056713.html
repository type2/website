Subject: A Success!!

Hey all,
Yet another engine update.

Finally through additional valve adjustments I got rid of the valve 
noise (this is why you should not attempt to adjust the valves with 
spongy lifters :-) and now the engine is quiet, smooth, and purrs.  It's 
so good to have it back on the road.  It's got good power and runs 
great.

I was going to do a compression test.  I got the tester threaded into #1 
and did the test, and was dismayed to find a reading of 90 psi!!  When I 
removed the tester I found the problem -- the rubber o-ring that makes 
the seal at the top of the threads had torn and was split. Whew!  So I 
can't do the compression test until I get a new o-ring.

But from where I sit it is a success.  I will try to quantify it later 
with a compression test.
