Hi Gang,
	I've been lurking here for a while, and on the VW aircooled NG.  I moved accross the continent a year ago (necesitating the sale of my last &quot;VW product&quot; - a '67 Porsche 912).  I have been kicking myself since selling my '73 westy four years ago and just bought a realy clean '78 bus in New Hampshire.  The new bus needs some work, so I'm hoping to hit you all up for valuable advice as things progress.  I'd love to meet any air-cooled types in the New England area, so feel free to drop me a line if you are in the &quot;upper valley&quot;.

Later

Mike
