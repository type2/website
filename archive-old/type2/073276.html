Subject: Re: where are you?????

I figure at least one Australian should reply to this, not that there seems
to be alot of us on this list ...... which is surprising as there still
seems to be quite a few buses around, at least there is where I'm from
....which is.....

	Yaroomba
	Sunshine Coast
	Queensland
	Australia

..and I drive...

	'76 Camper

       'bye
