Subject: turn-signal problem 71 Westy

You know it. After about 10-15 flashes, the bulbs suddenly flash at 
high speed. First thought, change the bulb, BUT

- - this happens both Left and Right, front and back. And it does NOT 
happen with the Emergency flasher!
- - Bulbs look good.
- -I do have a problem with the turn-signal switch in that it does 
not always stay in place. But this problem happens even when I hold 
the indicator on.

I have the 71 wiring diagram, great, but it doesn't tell you where 
the relays etc are in real life.  Or even if they are combined 
somehow (the 70 looks like a combined dimmer and flasher relay), and 
as the wires go down the steerig column and other hidden places, how 
do I test for coninuity etc. Do I need to?

Plea for help: How do I find the real weak link?  I have inspected 
wiring at the lenses,  ok, and good grounds.  I cant really see under 
the dash - what a mess that it!
what to do?

-Thanks, Olive
