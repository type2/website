 &gt; &gt;I've been having problems for a long time now, where belts that are

 &gt; &gt;It could be that I have a 6 volt pulley on the generator, and a 12
 &gt; &gt;volt pulley on the crankshaft.  Would this be likely to cause such a
 &gt; &gt;problem?  What are the sizes of the four pulleys involved?
 &gt; 
 &gt; Crank pullies are all the same size (stock, anyway)

I have a pulley that I think came off a 25HP bug (1949). I'm pretty
sure it's smaller than the one on my 63 bus (42HP engine).
