Subject: [T2]  Front seat redo in a '71 westy

I've spent some time in the archives and library, but was wondering if anyone 
knew of a resource where I could find out what's involved in restoring my two 
little front seats.  They are currently partly original basketweave, a color 
between white and tan, and covered with towels and duct tape(Every once in a 
while I still hit a spring just right though:).  I've beeen working from 
outside in on my homemade resto, and they are the last piece of the puzzle.  
I've seen kits in catalogs, but am confused about what I need: cushions, 
foam, springs etc.  Is this something I should probably farm out, (I hate to 
do that), or is it within reason to think I can do a decent job.  I'm not 
looking to win a show, just be comfortable and presentable.  Thanks.
