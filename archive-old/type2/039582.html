Subject: Re: need '79 sliding door interior handle

I am also looking for this handle for my '77 bus.  I found them to be around
$40.00 at www.gowesty_dot_com  I also checked with the FLAPS in my neighborhood
and they quoted me the same price.  Hope this helps.  keep in mind that
there are different handles for different years and you will likely need the
exact year or close to it.

&gt; Hi all:
&gt;
&gt; I'm missing the interior handle for the sliding door on my '79 bus. More
&gt; accurately, I'm missing about one third or so of my handle (the remaining
&gt; two thirds was in pieces on the floor when I bought the bus).
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, if someone has a spare handle I'd happily be willing to purchase it.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks.
&gt;
