Subject: Re: [T2] Curtain info needed

In my '80, there's a coated cable pulled taut btwn. two screws into the:  
panelling, or body, I don't photographically recall.  The curtains, when 
pulled back, go behind this cable &amp; are held snug against the wall 
(eliminating distracting flapping w/windows wide).

Have you looked over the side paneling &amp; exposed body metal, vicinity of the 
bottom corner of the windows, touch to the right.  Rear hatch doesn't have 
anything on mine.  Then again, w/age difference &amp; all, this may apply (good 
intentioned greenhorn disclaimer).

SYOTR, Fall has fallen (in CO),

Hi Volks,
   I just came from the type2 library and couldn't find a definative answer
for my question.  I'm wondering what, if anything, is supposed to secure the
bottom of the curtains in my 71 westy...
