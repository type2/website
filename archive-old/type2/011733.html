Darn it, how do you get the darn thing through the hole?

Right, so I've purchased a new metal fuel line to replace the one 
that goes from the engine compartment through the firewall to the fuel
tank, and I've purchased a new rubber bushing/gasket (part 111-189a) that goes
around the fuel line where it goes through the firewall, to keep the tin
from cutting through the metal line.  Unfortunately, I can't get the bushing
through the hole in the firewall!  I've greased it up, tugged on it, pushed
on it, everything I can think of and still it won't go through. 

I've noticed that http://www.type2_dot_com/library/fuel/fireprev.htm
mentions just using tubing wrapped around the metal line as opposed
to the bushing -- is this a sensible thing to do given that I've tried
about all I could to get the bushing through that hole and failed?
Is an alternative to this to just put 2-3&quot; of the cloth-braided fuel
line around the metal line where it passes through, wrapped in duct
tape to make it a snug fit, and with a clamp on either side of the 
firewall to keep it from moving or pulling through either way?  It
sounds like a hack, and I'm concerned that the metal clamps against the 
tin might vibrate a bit, but i can't see that having any real adverse
effects.

Anyway, just looking for methodology or alternatives.  I guess whatever
I do, I'll keep a good eye on the line there, I'd just love to use
someone else's hard work and experience instead of beating my head
against the wall and/or losing my lovely bus to a hasty decision to use
an unsafe fuel-line method.

many thanks,
