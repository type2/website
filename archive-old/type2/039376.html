Subject: RE: Which set of gaskets?

&gt; I'm at BUS DEPOT site trying to order the proper oil gaskets/strainer kits
&gt; for the new  1600 mexican VW engine I just had installed. Ther doesn't
appear
&gt; to be a way to ask them on a question on line, they just offer a link back
to
&gt; type 2.

Yes there is.  The email address is on every page, sales_at_busdepot_dot_com, and
there is also a form you can use.

&gt; Who can tell me if I need a ..
&gt; 1.Gasket set/oil strainer 1200-1600CC (5 sets of gaskets of
&gt; gaskets/ crush washers) $2.95
&gt; 2.Oil strainer/gasket kit 1200 -1600      65 cents each.

Same item, just a different quantity. These are the oil strainer gasket kits
for stock Type 1 engines.
