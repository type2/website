Subject: [T2] westy sink/cooler for sale

    Time is running out fast for me, need to be outa my house in the next two 
weeks and still too much crap to go. Gotta westy sink/cooler for 69-71 50$ 
you pick up. Also got the under dash shelf for a bay, never got a chance to 
use it so I'm not sure what side it fits $40 which is less than I paid. I'm 
in SoCal, Riverside area 909 898 1380

    Bus stuff, got a note from the folks I sold my 70 westy to,they just got 
back from Alaska put over 10k mi with out any problems other than change oil 
and adj. valves and this on an under $3k bus keep em stock and drive the hell 
outa them
