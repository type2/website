Subject: NEW Heavy Duty Trailer Hitches for Busses!

At long last, there is a quality trailer hitch once again available for
Busses!

For years, the only trailer hitch readily available here in the States has
been those flimsy ones that bolt to the rear tow hooks. With almost no
tongue weight capacity and relying solely on the tow hooks for support, they
were suitable only for the smallest of trailers. Two years ago, I found a
South African made genuine VW hitch for Vanagons that replaced the bumper
brackets, making it much stronger and capable of carrying much more. Alas,
while VW had once made such a hitch for busses, they had discontinued them
years ago.

Well, I have good news!  I finally have a good quality, European made
&quot;knockoff&quot; of that original VW bus hitch.  Like the genuine VW hitch once
sold in Europe (and the genuine VW Vanagon one I sell now), this hitch
actually REPLACES your existing bumper brackets, so it bolts directly to the
frame, not to the tow-hooks. This makes the hitch essentially an extension
of the frame, rather than simply relying on the tow hooks for support. The
bumper than bolts onto the hitch, so that the hitch is hidden behind the
bumper. All you see from the outside is a small metal plate that the hitch
ball attaches to (and the ball itself), with the rest tucked up under the
bumper.  While they don't use our capacity rating system in Europe, this is
very obviously a cut above the flimsy tow hook mounted hitch previously
available here. While I can't say I'd tow a 30 foot RV trailer with one, I
think it's safe to say that this hitch could handle just about anything
you'd be likely to tow with a Bus.

The hitch comes with a 2&quot; ball.  Because of the way the ball mounts to the
hitch (European style), other sizes are not readily available in the US.
(See http://www.brink-towbars.co_dot_uk/media/flange.half.pic.gif  to get a
rough idea of how the ball mounts to the hitch, and why a US style &quot;straight
up and down&quot; tow ball wouldn't work; although that picture is not of a VW
hitch or even one from the same manufacturer, it uses the same ball.) It may
be worth noting, though, that several people who bought my Vanagon version
had a receiver hitch welded to the vertical steel plate that the ball would
bolt to, thus converting it to a receiver style hitch.  Apparantly the going
rate for such a modification at a trailer place is about $75. Otherwise, as
shipped it's simply a 2&quot; ball hitch.

Also available is an optional bike rack that bolts to the same vertical
plate.  This allows you to carry up to 3 bicycles without strapping anything
to your hatch or roof.

I imported these directly from the distributor in Europe; nobody else in the
U.S. has them, and I only have a limited quantity. Once they're gone it will
be 6 months before I have more. Pricing is as follows.  They are on the
website, or you can order toll-free.

Hitch:  $169.95   Part #'s PVW7 ('68-71),  PVW9 ('72 only),  PVW15 ('73-79)
Bike Rack for Hitch:  $129.95   Part $ 85663
