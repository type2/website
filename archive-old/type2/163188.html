&gt; Before you buy that aluminum case, check out the archives here and on 
&gt; The
&gt; Samba.  Lots of info there to help you decide if you really want to 
&gt; make
&gt; this purchase.

Unfortunately, this is the kind of search that's almost impossible to 
do and get specific information.

Would someone be so kind as to summarize the pros and cons of the new 
cases?

Many thanks,

Mark
