Subject: Re: [T2] Get our your sliderulers...

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Sounds like a solution we need to homebrew!!! More
&gt; &gt; power, better emissions, better fuel efficiency...
&gt; &gt; Think we could do it for less than $14K?
&gt;
&gt; I'd like to see a controlled, independent test of this concept.  It takes
&gt; as much energy to liberate hydrogen via electrolysis as it returns when
&gt; burned.  From the description in the article, it seems like just another
&gt; perpetual motion machine.

if they could use the excess heat to liberate the hydrogen...
