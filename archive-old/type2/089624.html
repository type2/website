Subject: Re: [T2] bike rack and door seals

Hiya Daniel,

Insofar as the front door seals go...............  I've used Permatex 
Wetherstrip Adhesive on my Bus.  Works great and it's yellow just like the 
original factory adhesive.  

One suggestion though.........place the new seals properly and place adhesive 
in the front run (where there is no channel) but do not place adhesive in any 
of the channels.  Allow the seal to &quot;adjust&quot; itself in these channels over 
the period of a few days.  It won't fall out - much.  But it will even itself 
out - no stretches and no bunches in the rubber.  Then go back and apply the 
adhesive in foot long sections.  Your seal, your bus, and you will be a lot 
happier in the long run.

And........I hope you got good seals.  I have learned a world about rubber 
seals since I redid my Bus.  And basically it all comes down to this, do not 
trust company names.  Even the very best.  However, do check in with Ron 
Salmon at The Bus Depot.  He will make sure that you do get seals that 
actually fit and do the intended job.
