Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Vanagon Crew Cab

was writ
&gt; US
&gt; importation regulations just killed them on the US market.

not import regulations as much as selective tarrifs. pickups where subject
to import duty, ever wonder why japanese trucks were shipped without pickup
beds? VW had a bit of a problem there. See a decent amount of them running
around the island here. Guy down the road from me has one that sits besides
his house and never moves, what a waste.
