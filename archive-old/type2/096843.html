Subject: free stuff comin' out

cleaning out the garage. listees, i have an extra heat shield - the one
that lives below the rear tin and above the muffler (and cat. converter).
it is 29&quot; long and 4&quot; wide. if you don't have one on your 75 &amp; up, you
should, especially if you have a cat converter which gets hot-hot. its got
rust, but is stable enough to do the job for another 20 years at least.
free for the actual shipping from oregon.   - steve
