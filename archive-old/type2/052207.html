Subject: [T2] '76 Owners Manual CHEEP

Well since the evil filter caught this one, I'll post it again
while we wait for the gods to let it through....

Like say $7 shipped to anyone who wants it that can prove 
to me (with picture) they got a '76. I don't want to see this 
on &quot;a famous internet selling site&quot; the next day. Will ship it
in a $3.25 priority pack for that price, so the manual is costing
U a whopping $3.75 or so.  RMMW wants some ridiculous
$20 or so NOS, more than Uncle Joel used to get em for
new from the dealer so I don't figure I'm out of line.

Nice manual off our old (1 owner) '76. Small pen mark on 
cover, 2 WV license plate #'s written in pen on back cover,
otherwise as new.  Fun reading and deserves to be sitting
in a glove box for another 20 years somewhere.
