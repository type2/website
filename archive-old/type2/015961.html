I have seen fans with no notches on the pulley - I don't know if they are
aftermarket or what but they are out there.  I would find TDC as Karl or
Chris suggested and then mark your pulley.  If you need a quick fix for
timing, do the following:  Start your motor and let it idle.  Loosen your
distributor and advance it slowly until the rpms stop increasing.  If you
go too far the engine will start to stumble - back it off till the rpms are
at a maximum and it runs smooth.  You should have both vacuum hoses
connected.  At this point you have something like 20 degrees BTDC initial,
which is way too much.  Retard the distributor slowly (clockwise I believe)
until the RPMs drop significantly - 200 to 300rpm lower is about right
depending on how high your idle was set initially.  You will notice the
exhaust note getting louder and more &quot;raspy&quot; or &quot;labored&quot; sounding.  At
this point you will be in the neighborhood of 0 degrees or TDC.  

Don't use this to mark your pulley - it's not nearly precise enough.  All
this will do is get your timing into a &quot;safe&quot; range where you can drive it
for a while until you are able to time it exactly.
