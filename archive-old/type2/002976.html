I believe I still have the dubious honor of the worlds stock (or certainly
the US stock) of one type of Westy plaid which I purchased from the Trim
(Thing) shop then sold off to the list at cost a few years back.  I actually
have what I classify the yellow plaid.  It is yellow, black, orange, and
green and came primarily in late Chrome Yellow standards.  BUT the major
colors in mine are YELLOW, and GREEN, with orange and black being the
smaller stripes, it looks more yellow than anything.  There is a
predominantly Orange used in '74-'75ish deluxes and a predominantly Green
used in later deluxes.  Anyone interested in the color I have, I still have
enough to sell off some pieces for front seats but not enough to sell for an
entire interior.  The material is 54&quot; wide and 2 yards will do front seats
to spare.  I'd have to figure what I had in it again, this stuff was around
$10/yd when I bought it.
