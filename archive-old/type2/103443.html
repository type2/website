&gt; Has anyone heard of Individual Cylinder Temperature Gauges on a '75 Transporter?  I've heard people speak of them but can't find any information from retailers, etc.

what I have seen done is put a sender on each cyl but only one guage and
have a rotary switch that you can then select which cyl to have connected
to the guage.
