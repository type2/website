Subject: DRIVER WANTED (fs '76 Westfalia)

Driver wanted,

FOR SALE: 1976 Volkswagen Campmobile Westfalia

GENERAL FACTORY EQUIPMENT:
- - 1976 VW Campmobile    VIN 2362113961    111,250 miles
- - 4 speed
- - Chrome yellow with color-coordinated interior upholstery, green carpets
- - Basic campmobile equipment: 2 tables, curtains for all windows, sink 12 volt
water pump with 7 gal. water tank, 1.1 cu. ft. icebox (You add the ice)
- - Optional equipment: front mounted spare tire, And a VW free-standing 
Campertent which measures 7ft by 10ft.
- - I have the original 1976 VW owner's manual and the Volkswagen Campmobile 
manual plus parts receipts and fuel receipts from 1983.

HISTORY:
- - First owner bought the camper new in Oregon and traveled around the west.
- - He sold it to a lady in Houston, Texas in 1979 with 55000 miles on it. She
used the van mostly for weekend camping trips and a tour of west Texas. She
sold the camper for the same reason that I am now selling it.   
I'm just not using it enough!
- - I bought the camper in 1982 with 77163 miles on it. I did the usual things a
new owner does, fix all the oil leaks and put everything back to factory specs.
- - I moved Ohio in 1985 and found a good dry garage to store the camper in for
the winter months. The camper was a third car so it was never driven in the
snow or on salt covered streets.
- - An engine/transaxle transplant was done in 1987 at 92667 miles. After having
several Monza exhaust systems on the camper I found an engine at a junk yard
with a good factory exhaust and transaxle for a reasonable price. The 1977 bus
that the engine/trans came out of had only 54000 miles when it was crashed in
the front. All seals were replaced along with the clutch, pressure plate, and
throwout bearing. All new CV joints (4 total) and boots were installed at this
time.
- - In 1989 at 95731 miles major brake work was done. New rotors in front, new
master cylinder, rear wheel cylinders, and new pads and shoes.
- - The original Westfalia pop-top seals were replaced with a seal set from WCM
in 1990. All fiberglass was cleaned, primed, and repainted with white enamel
paint. The front seats were restored the at this time. Only the padding was
replaced because the seat cloth was still in good condition.
- - The muffer and tailpipe were replaced in 1992. I replaced all 4 of the copper
exhaust seals which fit between the heads and the first exhaust tubes while the
exhaust system was off.
- - KYB gas stocks were installed front and rear in 1993. Also both headlights
were replaced with Halogen headlamps. This made a great difference in night
driving.
- - The clutch cable was replaced in 1994.
- - Last year I put a new maintenance free battery in and this year the ignition 
switch was replaced. The van passed the Ohio E./Check (tailpipe emissions test)
this year without any trouble.

All regular maintenance has been done on a time basis than mileage. I think the
oil and filter changes have been done less than every 1500 miles on average.
The original 1976 engine with 92667 miles on it is included as spare parts.
Other new spare parts are included.

CAMPING EQUIPMENT:
The camping equipment is all in very good condition. The canvas has no rips and
is clean.
Includes an excellent VW &quot;Drive-Away&quot; Tent: This 7' by 10' canvas tent features
a waterproof floor and a REALLY strong exterior steel frame. Nylon screening on
the front door and side windows keeps the bugs out. The front canvas door
provides privacy and also serves as a stylish sun awning.
Here is what makes this tent neat -- it can either attach to the bus (by a
rubber seal which clips into the rain gutter) creating a weather-proof two room
suite that is very comfortable or it can be used as a free-standing cabin tent
without the bus, like when you &quot;drive away&quot; for a day trip. It has a grey
rubberized bottom, yellow walls and a blue top, the awning is red and blue
stripes.

All curtains are in good shape. The cabinets look like new and there is not a
scratch on the surface around the sink. This area could easily be used as a
cutting board!

There are tables which can be setup for both front and rear areas. In addition
to the 12 volt fluorescent light there is a 110 volt hook-up with a breaker.
I have used lights, electric blankets, and even a small 110 volt heater.
The cabinets provide plenty of storage places for all your gear!

STRONG POINTS:

Lack of rust on the body and underside is a big plus for this vehicle. I think
the next owner could keep the body and frame looking nice and structurally
sound for a long long time. All bets are off if the camper is ever driven on
salt covered streets! However, the body is not in showroom condition. There are
some minor parking lot door dimples and some bubbling of paint under the
windshield. These discrepancies not detract greatly from the general appearance
of the camper and have no effect on the ability to use it as a camper. The
paint is almost entirely the original factory finish with a high degree of 
shine.

The mechanical condition is excellent. The 1977 engine and transmission have
less than 75000 miles on them:
                      (54000 + (111250 - 92677)) = 72573 miles on eng/trans.
      miles on 77 eng/trans + current - miles when installed = total miles.

No one has touched the camper besides myself in the last 14 years. I did have
a tire shop put on 4 new tires at 95000 miles. I immediately retorqured the lug
nuts to the correct specs using a torque wrench. I have been a an ASE certified
technician since 1979. I &quot;retired&quot; from the automotive service world and now
work only on my own cars.

SALE PRICE:

I asking $5000 for the camper with all the extra equipment. I am NOT interested
in selling the extra engine or the VW tent separately at this time! The only way
I do this is if the buyer only wants the camper less the engine or the tent.
Any inquires about the engine or tent will be filed, but no response will occur
unless I still have one or both after the sale of the camper.
I am not rushed to sell the camper at this time and will store it if no
acceptable offer comes around this fall.

You can contact me by email or telephone.
