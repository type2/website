Subject: An odd book I own...

I acquired a box of Volkswagen related literature and in the box was
this book. I would appreciate any information on its usefulness or
rarity.

It is about 14 inches by 8 inches, hard cover, held together with two
brass screws (the pages) , navy blue, all in German, it appears to be a
repair manual of some sort. On the front it
reads...Dienst.....Reparatur-Leitfaden...VW-Personenwagen 1952/54.

It has tons of pictures of early splits and it is in excellent
condition.Any ideas?
