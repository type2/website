Subject: Re: [T2] CV joint troubles


Dave Bolan and other esteemed listees:

My noise would indeed be a clunk, clunk, clunk, clunk - in time to the spinning tire...

I replaced the really chewed up drivers side outer joint because it would make a repeated clunk when I
turned left hard.  This new replacement joint just clunks all the freakin' time, even when I'm going
straight ahead.  Needless to say, I'm not driving the bus except to test it out...

Can I clarify what you're telling me in your email below?  Jack up just one tire, block all other wheels,
start car without emergency brake engaged, put bus in first gear, then let out clutch??  Won't this send
me flying off the jack stands, blocks or no blocks?  Would it make more sense to jack up BOTH wheels?

And you're saying have a buddy in the bus to hit the brakes when/if needed, but I stay outside and peer
into the cv joint vicinity to see exactly where the clunk is coming from?  Sounds a little hairy.

I don't want to die for a clunk, y'know?

Thanks,

Paul

&gt; Describe &quot;clunk&quot;...not? clunk, clunk, clunk...but just clunk?
&gt;
&gt; Jack driver side rear up after putting large wheel chocks on every other
&gt; wheel....put car in 1'st at idle....assuming you haven't installed
&gt; posi-trak&lt;grin&gt;.
&gt;
&gt; Have a helper in the car when you do this and be ready to apply brakes.
&gt;
&gt; Listen for clunk.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt; So my drivers side outer joint was really chewed to bits.  I went out and bought two more (one for
&gt; &gt; road backup, as the list advises...), replaced the offending joint, and man, if that clunk didn't
&gt; &gt; get LOUDER.  Now I've removed and reinstalled the joint twice to no avail.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This weekend I'm gonna do some serious thinking about it.  What could be loose?  Dirty?  Could a bad
&gt; &gt; CV joint mess up some other nearby component like brakes or wheel bearings?
