Subject: Gas smell
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hello, I wonder if any of you could shed a 
little light on my problem here. Every now and then...actually quite often I smell gas when I'm driving. I took it to the shop and my mechanic looked it over...checked for leaks...etc and there was nothing. He could'nt find any thing wrong.
Anybody have any clue as to what could be causing this?? Please email me directly.

Thanks,

Greg
