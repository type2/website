I spent the weekend (yes the whole thing) trying to tune up Russ, my 72.  I
finally sorted out the valves, got them adjusted and then readjusted when I
recognized the loud clicking sounds.  New cap and rotor, points,  plugs and
only 1 (one!) old plug, that I know of, is now rolling around in the engine
on the left head somewhere.  The used  timing light I picked up turned out
to be dead, and I'll need to take it back this week.

 I attempted Muir's static timing, when I couldn't use the strobe, but
was/am really confused.  Aren't VW buses type2's but their engines type 4s?
I have a '72 bus with a 1700 engine, upon which is a serial number beginning
with CB, which Muir has listed as a type2 motor.  Additionally, the entry in
his chart for a 72, CB motor has no info on static timing.  After his page
and a half rant on static timing versus strobe, you'd think he'd at least
put forth a complete list.  I know the timing is 1 of 4 possible, according
to Muir, but which one?  According to my reading of my engine, the static
light comes on about 5 deg. BTDC, which is listed as a possibility.
However, there is a mark on my timing scale at 5 deg. ATDC which is also
what is listed in Muir as correct for stobe timing.  How can it be both 5
degrees before one way and 5 degrees after, the other way and be correct?

After that bit of frustration, I decide to check my carbs to see if they
were synched.  I fooled with the air mixture adjust and idle adjust, trying
to get to a 'steady' 900 RPM's, but screwed them up.  The air mixture screw
doesn't seem to change anything when adjusted all the way down or quite a
ways out.  The idle adjust only increases the amount of air suction coming
down the tall tube between the 2 adjusting screws on the left carb.  Screw
it outwards and it sounds like the suction tube in a dentist's office
getting louder and louder, screw it in and it gets quieter and quieter.
Having both screwed down completely makes the engine run rougher but doesn't
kill it.  No matter what I do, the idle wont drop below 1000 RPMs.

Anyone in the Seattle area who could give me a hand with them?  I know
fooling with carbs sucks, but I really could use a knowledgeable hand.  The
carbs are Solex pict 3 somethings, I think, the last exploded view carb in
Haynes looks the most like them, with the tall suction tube sitting between
the air mix and idle mix adjustment screw tubes.  I don't have my book here
with me at work.

I've got a Uni-syn, a tach/dwell/volt/rpm meter, assorted tools but no
timing light though.  Any help would be terrific!  I'd offer to pay you, but
I am really straped right now.  I can feed ya, entertain ya and fix/upgrade
your computer though!  I also know a few knock knock jokes, but only as a
last resort.

Thanks,
