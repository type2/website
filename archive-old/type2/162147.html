Subject: RE: No spark at coil WAS &quot;No start after running&quot;

Thanks for the idea Will. I just had the bus running, I cleaned the
spade connectors that slide onto the coil and it started after a little
cranking. Timing was verified correct with a timing light, 0TDC 28WOT, I
am running a 009 right now. I definitely get spark at the coil it is
just it doesn't want to do it every time. After having it run for a bit
I checked the dwell, it was a bit off so I shut the engine off, adjusted
the dwell, turned the key but back to square one with the engine just
turning over but no fire. It is truly strange. I have not replaced the
condenser, but the Muir check for it indicated that it was just fine.

--everything else checks out, you should get spark at the coil.  I
assume
you've replaced the condensor also.--

Thanks,

Max
