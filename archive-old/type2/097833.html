Subject: thermastat inst./replacement

I am about to replace my rotted therm. none of my &quot; HOW TO &quot; books show this 
and unfortunately the cable is rotted away as well. Where does the cable go 
to from the therm. If anyone has gone through this before I would love a walk 
through. Pictures would be a plus or you can just come over and do it for 
me!!!  HA HA HA

Thanks in advance,

Johnny Spin
