Subject: Re: [T2] I've (still) Got the Oil Leak Blues...

Hello Zach     When you did the seal did you check the end play. Too much end 
play or a wore out case and you will never get the leak to stop. I always 
check the end play with no shims to determine  what I call the dead end play . If 
there is more that .055 in  then it is time to linebore the case. Also did 
you replace the o ring in the flywheel? After setting the end play I always put 
some permatex super 300 on the end of the crank and the flywheel where it 
mates to the crank. The other thing is tocheck for a crack behind the flywheel 
ussually on the number 3 cly. side. Hope this helps  later and have fun  Mark
