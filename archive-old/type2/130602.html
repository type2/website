Subject: connecting fuel vents to air cleaner?

Hi!

I don't have a charcoal canister anymore... I installed a weber 
progressive this weekend and I thought that I could plug the hose from 
the fuel vents directly in the air cleaner of my weber (where the oil 
breather connects). Is this a good idea? What comes out of this hose 
(fuel vent) exactly? It has been loose in the engine bay until today 
(previous owner had the bus for 5 years) and nothing bad happened...

Any thoughts?

Thanks,

Marck
