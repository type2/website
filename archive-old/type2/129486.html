The &quot;next generation Eurovan&quot; is already here: the T5, available
in Germany since late last year.

&gt; And I just have formed this opinion that there are good VWs and great VWs.
&gt; And all of the great VWs were made in Germany.  

Nah.  The new Caddy is great, and it's being made in Poland --
just like commercial Eurovan versions (Transporters) actually.

&gt; think the late 80's early 90's VWs are often overlooked. The Scirocco's,
&gt; GTI's, Jetta's, Cabby's are all awesome cars and built to last like our old
&gt; buses.

Yes.  My '87 GTI 16V is excellent, even at 326k kilometres.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
