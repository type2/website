...Assuming that you're running a thermostat and flaps
in that engine, it means your preheater tubes are
getting blocked up. If the weather was colder, you'd
probably have ice there. If you're not, that means
you're not doing long enough trips to get the motor to
normal operating temp.

&gt; I've been noticing a lot of
&gt; condensation on
&gt; the inlet manifold and carb of my 1600 '74 bay....
&gt; ( I only do short trips daily ( 6 miles each way )
