Subject: WI  -  KISS

	Here's a typical answer to an inquiry from a T2 listee. 
Only the names have been deleted to protect the guilty  :-)



&gt;
&gt;Now if I do this really elaborate WI

	I won't help  -  my approach is simple not elaborate


&gt;  for my [deleted]
&gt;engine (FI) how do I determine what is too little or
&gt;too much?

	If you get a water/fuel ratio in the range 5 - 10% you'll get 
most of the benefit without needing a huge water-bottle or refills 
between fuel fillups.


&gt;
&gt;Do you think a bus FI cold start injector might
&gt;deliver too much?  You may not be familiar with that as
&gt;I'm sure they must not be as common there as here.

	I know nothing about this device.

&gt;
&gt;I was thinking about building a DC pulse unit to
&gt;adjust the WI spray.

	Snap out of that digital worldview, bwah.  This is an 
analogue process -  the suction in the inlet pipe (before it splits 
into a manifold) varies according to need, so the only variable is 
the needle size and you're done.  Most likely a tiny needle e.g 
0.51 mm ID will do.  Make sure needle point is in middle of pipe so 
as to prevent induction bias.


&gt;  Unknowns include whether water
&gt;will flow through the injector / how much pressure
&gt;will be required to get a good spray pattern rather
&gt;than a dribble / whether any of this will work as well
&gt;as your hypodermic needle approach..

	Not a show.

Let me know how it goes
