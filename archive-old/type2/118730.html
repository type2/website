Subject: Hard start relay mounting location

On my '71 bus, I put the hard start relay and fuse inside the engine
compartment (near the voltage regulator). It seemed a tradeoff between
mounting it inside and exposing it to higher temperature or mounting it
outside and exposing it to water, mud, etc. By mounting it inside it is a
little easier to get to than underneath if it does need to be replaced.
Regardless of where it is mounted, I think it is a good idea to carry a few
spare relays and fuses.

I've had it there for about 6 years now and the only problem that I have had
was on an extermely hot July day in Nevada when the temp was probably over
100 degrees. I stopped and shut off the engine and when I came back to start
it - nothing. It turned out that the hard start relay fuse had blown but I
had a spare so I wasn't held up for long. It was near the end of a 10,000
mile 4 month trip to Mexico and that was the only time I was stopped for any
kind of mechanical problem.
