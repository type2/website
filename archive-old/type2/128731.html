Subject: charcoal canister

Hi!

In my 1700cc westfalia, I don't have a charcoal canister anymore. I 
still have the fuel vent lines. But, on top of the engine in the engine 
compartiment, I have a hose that is connected to the fuel vent lines 
and does not connect anywhere...

What should I do with this? What did you guys did to replace the 
charcoal canister?

I sure don't want fuel vapors to roam in my engine compartment!

Thanks!

Marck
