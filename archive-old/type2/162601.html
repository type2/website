&gt; &gt; I've done this before it is not that hard, have nice piece of side
&gt; &gt; window glass (one piece) and brand new rubber from BD but can't get
&gt; &gt; the rubber to stay on the glass while I get it into the opening,
&gt; Bob,
&gt;
&gt; is it the correct size rubber? the few windows I have installed all fit
&gt; quite snug on the glass so that movement was about impossible. I did
&gt; have a gasket that came in from a vendor that was incorrect and it did
&gt; the same thing yours did because it was the incorrect gasket.
&gt;

good point, it was new old stock from bus depot but ?????  have a good
older gasket that I think I will check out.  how much different is the
size between the rear and center (single piece) window gaskets???  maybe
it is a rear window gasket??

&gt; &gt; I swear I don't remember it being this hard before...
&gt; hehe. &quot;that's what she said&quot; (sorry how often do you actually get to
&gt; type that ;)


GROOOAAN!

thanks
Bob
