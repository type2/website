&gt; On my drive home in the afternoons, I pass through a pair of dips in the

&gt; of the ball joints, but when the alignment was done around a month ago,
&gt; the technician at Sears checked them and said they were fine.  :/  Could
&gt; be he just didn't know how to check them.


if it were a ball joint I assure you, you'd know it, the front of your van
would be sitting on the concrete and a wheel would be going a strange
direction.

more likely a shock
