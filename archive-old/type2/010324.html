Subject: TRADE 67 single cab in Florida for 75-79 Westy
Message-ID: &lt;19991013013717.38701.qmail_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

I have a friend that is looking to trade his '67 single cab for a Westy so 
he can take his kid on vacation. He wants atleast an 1800, so thats why he 
said 75-79. Matt is located in Gainesville Florida. His phone number is 
352-379-7722.
