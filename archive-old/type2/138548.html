Subject: How to remove a rear drum on a 71-79 bus 

Hello,

This is a little trick that I did not find mentioned in &quot;bartnik's&quot; article 
(&quot;http://www.type2_dot_com/bartnik/tech.htm&quot;) concerning rear brake drum 
removal. Nevertheless, the article was of great help!

I got confused by some post saying that an extractor would help remove it. 
In fact this is wrong, the extractor would pull on the wheel nuts, which are 
attached to a plate sitting behind the drum brake, secured by the 46mm nut.

In short: there is no place to grab that darn drum brake to pull it out. 
Instead, use a punch to gently tap the drum out by hitting the drum through 
the &quot;check the wear hole&quot; in the backplate. Hit a little and then turn the 
drum and hit again until it comes out. Hit only the drum, not the brake shoe 
:)

Arnaud
