Content-Disposition: Inline

HI Campers, specs follow
 83 Vanagon Westy air cooled, 4 sp, A/C, full Westy with 3 way Frig etc.
20k on completely rebuilt engine. The &quot;Leprechaun&quot; is Kelly Green with
white and gold striping and is in excellent condition. No rust and very
clean. Too bad my primitive Web TV wont allow photos. Must be seen.
$4500 and well worth it.
Jack in Gulf Breeze, FL, near Pensacola
