Subject: paging terryk, painting question

terry, list,

i have a trailer hitch that i fabbed and i need to paint it in short order
for a short tow on sunday.  these are the details on the hitch.

1) all bare metal most of it blasted with black beauty media, the
remainder was blasted with steel shot.

2) i am planning on going over what i can with some 80 grit paper on my
grinder to minimize the the aggressive blast pattern from the black beauty.

3) my compressor is out of commission so i will need to paint this with
brush.

the question is what primer and paint combination could i use for this and
keep the paint cost under $50.  i normally use sherwin williams industrial
products primarily acid etching primer and acrylic automotive enamel.  the
hitch probably won't ever see salt spray so i don't need to worry about
that right now.  i was thinking red oxide primer and akyloid oil machine
paint but, i would really like to get some other suggestions.  as a note i
will pass on all the POR type products, so no need to post them.  right
now i think my biggest concern is finding a primer and paint combo that
will fill in the blast profile and weather well with use.
