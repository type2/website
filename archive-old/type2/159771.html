&gt;&gt; From everything I've read that should be enough to at least see some 
&gt;&gt; action
&gt;&gt; from the engine.  It has never fired, not once.  I figure it has to be 
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; timing but from the little I know it appears to be at least close to 
&gt;&gt; timed
&gt;&gt; correctly statically.
&gt; 
&gt; Do you have a timing scale?
&gt; 
&gt; It sounds like you do but I just thought I'd ask.
&gt; 
&gt; If you don't have a timing light, you should consider getting one to do 
&gt; your own maintenance.

&gt; Sears has a good one for $49. Search on 00921027000.

&gt;&gt; I used the pencil in the #1 cylinder to find TDC, which
&gt;&gt; was almost exactly where the notch in the pulley is.  When I hand 
&gt;&gt; crank the
&gt;&gt; engine w/ the distributor cap off the rotor aligns with the 
&gt;&gt; distributor mark
&gt;&gt; exactly at 7.5 BTDC.  I've tried rotating the distributor a bit both ways
&gt;&gt; while the engine was turning over to no avail.

did you actually verify that #1 is at the firing TDC.  Here is how you 
verify this:

You will want to verify that the rotor lines up with #1 at #1's TDC 
firing position. This can be done by watching the valves and lining up 
the timing mark at 0.  If you don't know how to do this, here's a quick 
rundown.  Spin the crankshaft such that the distributor rotor spins 
clockwise (remember, firing order is 1432).

Looking at valves for #1 (passenger side, towards front of car, also 
marked on tin as #1.  Exhaust valve is towards the front of the car), 
rotate the crankshaft until both valves are closed.  Keep turning and 
watch for exhaust to open (pushing out exhaust), keep turning until 
intake opens (sucking in gas), keep turning until intake closes (bottom 
of compression, keep turning until timing mark at 0* (I think that last 
turn from intake closing to 0 tdc is about 180 degrees).  The whole 
cycle takes up 720 degrees (two full crankshaft turns).  You now have #1 
at tdc firing position.  Rotor in distributor should line up with the 
line on the SVDA which denotes plug #1.

Without turning the crank, you can also look at the angle of the 
distributor drive gear and make sure it's the proper angle according to 
the bentley - I think it's 12 degrees or something like that.  Also, 
make sure the shaft where the distributor drive dog fits has the offset 
to the correct side, according to the bentley.
