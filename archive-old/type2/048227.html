Subject: [T2] Type 2 MPG

Just got home last night after 5 weeks of wonderful weather and 
camping, and over 5,000 miles of super bus travelling and bus ham radio.
Got just a tad over 23 mpg and not problem one from Casper during the 
trip.
Casper just kept running and running GREAT !!

So, after all that, ......................
When I get up this morning to turn Casper around in the driveway so as 
to have an easier time unloading &quot;stuff&quot; ...........
You guessed it !!
Casper does not turn over.
Guess I will be looking at the starter switch and associated wiring 
this week.
Probably a good time to finally get around to a start relay system 
installation.

I love that guy !
What a sport !
