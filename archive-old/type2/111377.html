&gt; Questions: 1) I assume I should do upper and lower at the same time. Are
&gt; they the same part number? I think so.

Yes

&gt; 2) Is it worth it to get the German parts?

Yes, though other sources seem to have gotten better.  Go with a retailer
that knows his stuff and he'll get you the right parts.

&gt; 3) What else do I need to order? I do not want to be stuck half way through
&gt; this job and not have the parts ready. Muir says something about the front
&gt; stabilizer bar parts that need be replaced.

I didn't need to.  You have to have the joints pressed into the torsion
arms.  I seem to recall that Bus Boys did this on an exchange basis.

Getting the joints our of the spindle was the hardest part for me,  I used
a Chevy pitman arm puller for this.

&gt; I drove 100 miles today to get new shocks that I was assured were in stock
&gt; to find out they had only one. I was gonna get the gas adjust type, but they
&gt; did not even have the stock type. Bummer.

ARRGH!  I hate that and I have 2 VWFLAPS within 5 miles of home.
