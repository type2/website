Subject: Civil rights legislation clarified

&gt; being &quot;universally negative&quot; or even an SOB is NOT illegal.

&quot;Discrimination on the basis of race, sex, national origin, age and
disability are prohibited under both state and federal law.&quot;

So, being universally negative is not protected under the law, either.

As a woman, I understand your abhorrence of discrimination.
Additionally, I abhor oppression. And I find Thom's behavior oppressive.
Apparently, so do a lot of other people, based on the p-mail I'm getting.
