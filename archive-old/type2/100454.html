Subject: Re: [T2] HELP! rear end droning noise

I have to agree with Chris.  Sounds like a bad wheel bearing.  I had the 
same thing happen to my '70.  Thought the tranny was going to fall out.  As 
it got worse, I thought it would be my teeth.  Seems the P.O.(my dumba$$ 
brother) had put ball bearings on the inside and outside of the rear bearing 
housing.  On top of that, he &quot;forgot&quot; to clean and repack the bearing when 
his wheel cylinder exploded, so what grease there was left contained a rusty 
sludge.  You never know what people will(or won't) do when faced with a 
challenge.  If you're going to have to look at the bearings on both sides, 
you might as well replace them all.  Use a good grease.  I like the 
synthetics.

	Eron
