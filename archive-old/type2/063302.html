Subject: Ignition switch short cuts

There was some discussion about replacing ignition switches recently...  Has
there been any discussion or does anyone have any shortcuts to replacing the
switch in a '79  There is a shear pin in the assembly and we can't quite figure
how to deal with it.   John Jensen in Annapolis
