Subject: [T2] Valvetrain animation

Folks,
The animation at the link below shows a cutaway of a piston/rod/crank/valvetrain in an overhead cam engine. In a VW engine of course there would be pushrods and lifters between the cam and the rockers, but the 4 cycles of the 4-cycle internal combustion engine are demonstrated quite nicely.

What it doesn't indicate is the 'overlap' at the end of the exhaust stroke when the intake and exhaust are both open for a short period, but hey -its the best engine animation i've been able to find so far.

Thought this would be something folks looking to visualize the process might want to check out.

I'd like to find a fully animated accurate portrayal of a vw engine - complete with valvetrain and distributor.
Someday...
