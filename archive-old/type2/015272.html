Hey all.
I have read the archives, there isn't that must recent there about poptop
canvas replacement. Has anybody shopped for this lately? I'm redoing a 71.
Any inputs on best price and quality? Ron, plan any specials in the near
future? I'm like broke but the weather in SC is wonderful..Camping HO!!!
Any input is appreciated.

Plus as an added bonus another question. Ever use paint stripper for
fiberglass? Picked it up at HOME D*POT. Before I melt the gel coat any tips?

Friday is almost here, Thank GOD and everything VW.
TIA
Mark
