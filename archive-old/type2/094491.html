Subject: fuel line replacement a go!

Richard says:
 
&gt;I measured my new clamps against the originals I took off but I haven't put them on yet.  Where did you have difficulty, at the injectors?

Yes, at the injectors, with the 7.5 high pressure benz hoze and MB clamp, the fit is tight. I sheared of the injector mounting stud trying to push the hose on the injector. The rest I will do by removing the injector and pushing hose on in my hand.

The fit over the rest of the fuel rail has been snug, but not difficult. I have also sanded the accumulated funk off the rails to make them shiny.

&gt;Buy boys has a kit of seals at a good price, aftermarket I believe, that I haven't tried yet.  Carmadillo has the small Bosch seal for 3.85 and the large one for 6.02.  Not kit that I know of.  Also haven't tried

I wouldn't waste time with any aftermarket. My originals are rubbery and thick and still very &quot;moist&quot; and pliable. The aftermarkets are more shiny, hard and plastic-like. Poor quality and fit.

Billy
