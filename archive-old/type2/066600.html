Subject: Re: The &quot;4 legged stool&quot; and Westfalia interiors (long!)

While we are discussing if the 4 legged stool referred in my 75
campmobile owner's manual as a &quot;jump seat&quot; and center console
referred to in the manual as a &quot;Trash container&quot; (from memory but pretty
sure its valid) I only had the center console when I purchased my 75
Deluxe from the PO. I now have both but not sure if it was meant for my
bus specifically. The manual shows both but it also shows an upper
cabinet.  This upper cabinet is in a hardtop westfalia and not a poptop in
the manual.  While in an effort to keep my 75 stock I went out and
purchased the 4 legged stool because it is cool and it matches.  Now my
question is, I have purchased an upper cabinet from a 76-79 poptop
westfalia, which is not original for my year but will sure blend in like it is
original.  Is this butchery on my behalf or am I justified in attempting to
have a very gigged out and very close to authentic westfalia?  I plan to
paint the little white push button for the cabinet black like my year even
though the white button was a plus for  the later years because
non-westfalia using passsengers won't break your handles as easily.   I
have also heard you could order just the components you wanted when
you bought a westfalia.  So maybe stool maybe not for 74 or 75. Those
of you out there with manuals double check because I think the 4 legged
stool is referred to as a &quot;jump seat&quot; and the center console as  &quot;trash
container&quot; but who really gives a darn when we all know what  items
we are talking about. Sorry for the rambling.
