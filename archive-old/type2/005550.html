Subject: [T2] Bad Gas Mileage


&gt;and no major problems except one- bad gas mileage. I have a 71' westy with
a
&gt;rebuilt 1600 dp with CW crank, fully balanced, Jacob's ignition, Berg
&gt;extractor, 1.25 rocker arms, and dual Kadrons. I am using a single can
&gt;vacuum dizzy, set for 30 degree total advance.I have been making these
&gt;Best mileage I could get on my trip was 15.5 mpg.
&gt;
I have a '71 westy with dual kadrons, 1900 cc and blue coil with a 009
dist., and get 18-19 mpg.  I would check how you have the vacuum hooked up
to the dizzy.  I don't think Kadrons are set up for vacuum dizzy's, I would
borrow a 009 ( or other mechanical advance dist.) and see if your mpg
improves.
