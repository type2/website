Subject: 76 bus shift rod rebuild/repair

Folks,

I am working  on fellow list members bus, and have just now removed the 
front shift rod ( the rear one will come out tomorrow, the engine is already 
pulled)

Of course the front bushing was shot, BUT what concerned me was what 
appeared to be welds on the end of it.......it appears that maybe there has 
been some repair to this tube.  I have not had one of these in my hands in a 
long time, but I have had my beetles in my hands recently and do not 
remember seeing any welds on it that were 1/8&quot; high......
Is this the way this piece generally looked with a slight bend where the 
shift rod went under the front beam?

The piece did seem to work, but i tend to be anal on repairs and fix things 
right, once.

My buddy said it shifted great, but I told him that most likely he got used 
to it :)) Wait until the shift rod bushings all get replaced!
