Subject: Not enough advance from vac can?

Still trying to get my state of tuning sorted out. Peregrine gets hot 
when she climbs mountains and other long grades; under 250F now, but 
still up around 240F or so.

I wonder if this might not be caused by a faulty vacuum advance? The 
reason I suspect this is that she also lacks power in the lower RPM 
ranges on upshifts. I shift somewhere between 3600 and 4000 RPM, 
depending on whether I am going uphill, downhill, or on the flat. For the 
first few moments in the next gear, the engine seems to have no pep.

Sound like a vacuum advance problem? I have done a suck test, and there 
is motion transfered to the dizzy, but A) I don't know if it's enough and 
B) I can't be sure (without a vacuum gauge on my dash) whether there's 
enough vacuum.

Thanks,

Mark Hineline and Peregrine
