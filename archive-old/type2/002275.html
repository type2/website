Hi all, just purchased a next to new tank for my '76 FI Bus and have been
told many things about the procedure.  Been told that engine must be removed
and also that it does not for fitting of replacement tank.  My current tank
is rusted internally and it must be done.
Also, what else is needed while tank is being replaced?  I'm assuming that
everything else can be reused from current tank (sender unit, etc) given
good shape.
Thank you all!
Sean
