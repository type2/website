Subject: Re: [T2] gas smell for me too

&gt;Just to be specific - assuming my 78 and the 79 are the same in this 
&gt;respect: the tall black vertical canister (going from memory) behind the 
&gt;passenger taillight is a vapor canister? I didint' know that! Shame on me. 
&gt;Also - how available are the filler necks - I've checked my usual vendors 
&gt;but didn't find one. Do you know if installation instructions (besides 
&gt;Bentley) exist, and how difficult was it?

You found the carbon canister (the correct part). Make sure the hoses are 
hooked up per Bentley. Seems like the tank vented to it through a small 
diameter vent hose. One hose went to the big black rubber tube that runs 
from the AFM to the throttle butterfly. The other end of the canister goes 
to the fan shroud. Basically when the engine is running the canister gets 
pressurized with cooling air to push fumes into the intake of the van. 
Somebody - forgive whoever you are - rebuilds them and has a website 
showing how. Not too hard.

Hope the info is right but verify everything I said. I keep my Haynes here 
at work to refer to but not my Bentley (which I prefer). Can't do it too 
often or the boss gets suspicious... &lt;grin&gt;

There are rubber hoses connecting to metal and plastic vent lines above 
both batteries I believe and in front of the firewall (gas tank side, not 
engine side). If you remove the firewall - remember the two bottom screws. 
Slide under the engine and look upwards on both sides of the bellhousing. 
If you loosen the other screws on the firewall these last two will keep the 
firewall from coming off and you'll learn where they are. &lt;grin&gt;

Just find the gas tank and follow the vent lines. You can't go wrong.

Good luck!
