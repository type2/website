&gt; Anyway, the kit contains a seal and Bently shows one in the picture but mine
&gt; did not have one when I took it apart.
&gt; Does anyone know which way the seal goes?  One side has a groove with a spring
&gt; inside.  The other side is tapered.

The spring always faces inward:

&gt; Also, when I went for grease my FLAPS had LubriMatic Disc &amp; Drum Brake, Hight
&gt; Temp Wheel Bearing Grease.  No other info is on the container.  The
&gt; description sounds right, but this stuff seems very thin like it would liquify
&gt; and ooz out when it gets hot.  The stuff I cleaned out was THICK.  Can anyone
&gt; recommend a good grease brand / type for this application?

Good call: sounds too thin. Mobil 1 grease in the cartridge about $5.
