Subject: RE: [T2] Bus Seats

Jason,

We sell new seat covers for $114.99. This is for the set. We also have
several good quality used seats ('74-'76) they sell for $49.99 each. The
used seats must be reupholstered. So a set of reconditioned front seats
would be $214.97. Yes it is a lot of money. There is the odd chance that
there are some good used seats out there.

Hey list,

    Does anyone know where i can get a new or near mint front seats for a 74
bus.  I would prefer the kind with headrests but it isn't necessary.  I have
checked the main suppliers that i know of and they are prettty pricy, If
anyone knows where to get some a bit cheaper please let me know.  Thank you
