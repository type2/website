&gt; So, could someone that has installed the rear Sway-a-way bar please tell me

My Rear Sway Bar Attach:
  Outer ends of the bar bolt w/bushings to the swing arms ends,
just below where the steel brake lines pass through the arms.
  Steel 'hose' clamps and urethane bushings attach the bar to
the torsion tube. The clamps are just inches outboard of where
the swing arm pivot is attached to the tube.  The bar runs
almost directly below the torsion tube here.
  The bar has bends to it so that it mostly stays tucked up and
out of the way for ground clearance sake.  One bend is near the
center section.  That section is about 12&quot; long and parallel to
the tube.  That center section also sticks forward (fif) about
5 1/2&quot; from where the swing arm pivot is (for reference).  Hope
this clears your 5-spd tranny, Mike.

Testamonial:
  In '95?, I bought a set of SAW sway bars for my '73 Westy. They
reduced the 'tipping over' feeling while cornering.  They also
reduced the rear wheels 'crawling over stuff' feeling when driving
off road.  A trade-off.  90% of the driving I do is on paved road
so I keep the rear sway bar on.
  I'd recommend that the front and rear suspension be in top order
before adding a sway bar kit.  If your ball joints, tie-rod ends,
shocks, etc are worn out, you're not going to get the most out
of the sway bar kit.

Broken Sway Bar:
  Last summer, my front SAW sway bar broke right near the urethane
bushing on the rt.  The broken end of the bar looked like it had
a crack 2/3 of the way through for a long while.  The remaining
1/3 of the bar looked like it sheared.
  To put this failure in context...  Since I installed the sway bars
I drove from L.A. to the arctic circle and back.  An 8K mile trip
of which about 1.5K miles were on unpaved road.  (Some of the roads
in Alaska looked nore like dry creek bottoms than roads.  Parts
of the Stewart-Cassiar highway also had more potholes than highway.)
I then drove L.A. to La Paz in Baja California Mexico and back.  Plus
daily driving duty, here in the city.  Some hard miles.
  I bought another SAW kit.  Replaced the broken front bar and sold
the new, leftover rear bar + hardware to a local VW mechanic for his
own VW doublecab truck.
