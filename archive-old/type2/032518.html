 - He also mentioned that he has a friend that does nothing BUT VWs. YAYAYAY!
 - He said that his friend dropped out the engine from a bus, sprayed the
 - inside with fire retardant, and then painted right over it. This sounds
 - pretty good to me, anyone else have any input?

 I would be interested to know:
A) Where your neighbour's  friend lives (is he in the UK)?
B) What was the fire retardent and where can it be obtained from?

Mike
