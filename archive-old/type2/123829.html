Subject: RE: [T2] Heat Question

Red levers down turn the heat on.  You may want to check your heater
cables, they attach to the lever on you heater boxes.  They like to
break off when some dork pulls the engine without detaching the cables
first (if this dork was you I apologize, but I've done it too).

The little flip lever by your right foot directs head either up to the
defrost vents or out the vents by your feet.

You will still freeze in the winter if you have temps below 40ish F.
Consider an eberspacher gasoline heater, you can find them used and they
will keep you warm an toasty.  I have a BN-4 in mine, and it is rockin.

&gt; Heater boxes are hooked up, cables are hooked up to them,
&gt; just trying to get the heater system kind of working before winter.
