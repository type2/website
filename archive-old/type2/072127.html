Subject: Re: How to remove window washer nozzles?

[...]
&gt;&gt;How do you remove the little window washer nozzles?
&gt;
&gt;&gt;needle nose pliers (or weeny vice grips), pinch the tabs; twist 90 degrees
&gt;&gt;and push all in one motion. -  steve
&gt;
&gt;Steve your hands must be small :-)
&gt;
&gt;Since mine are so big the only way I could get the washer nozzles off was
&gt;from the front, the only bad thing is you will BREAK them upon removal
&gt;-( However if someone from the rear can push in on the tabs you might get
&gt;lucky?
&gt;
&gt;The pattern of the metal where the nozzles snap into are like a +, you just
&gt;grab them from the front and twist 90 degrees as stated, however when you do
&gt;this from the front, you &quot;snap&quot; the retaining portion of the plastic.

under the dash i use a long nosed mini sized vice grip to access and lock
down on the tabs. i don't think there's a human in the world that can get
their fingers in squeezed in the area where those tabs are located. try to
remove and recycle before breaking things off.
