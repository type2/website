Subject: The Simpsons and VW's

Speaking of TV shows containing VW's a few episodes of the Simpson's (my
favorite show) show VW's (or artists renderings of VWs) usually in very
stereotypical situations.  The episode that always sticks out in my mind
is the one where Homer's meets his long lost mother.  At the end she
leaves on a electric powered bus.  I also believe that in the episode were
Bart and Lisa go to Camp Krusty they show a Bug.  School ends for the summer,
all the gets run out excited and a group of them rock/tip over a Bug.
Just some observations,
brett
