Subject: Rubbing Block

    Just got home from a short trip. I was taking the kids to see Chicken
Run at the movies.
We got about 6 miles from home and the bus just quit. I was luck enough to
pull into a business along the highway and tried a restart with no success.
I looked down one of the carbs and hit the throttle..I had gas.
Next I pulled the distributor cap off and thought the points were outta
adjustment or stuck but found the rubbing block broken off.(also found
cracks around the rivet). Of all the times I have my tools with me , this
was not one of them! I went into the business and phoned my sister in law
and she delivered my tool box along with a used set of points I had saved.
Replaced them and drove home to recheck and adjust them and the timing.

This was a set of Bosch points replaced about 3 K ago. Strange they would
break.
Moral: Always carry your tools and spares or you'll miss Chicken Run.
