The air-cooled Vanagon does NOT have two fuel pumps.  It has one fuel 
pump, situated just behind the gas tank, on the right side of the 
vehicle.  Many Vanagons, however, do have two fuel filters and maybe 
that's where you got confused.

Slide under the right side of the car, just behind the front wheel, and 
look at the fuel line exiting the gas tank.  On many cars you'll see a 
small plastic filter, then the pump, and then a big round metal canister 
which is a second filter.  If that's your setup you might try replacing 
the plastic filer and see if that helps.  I've heard of situations (but 
never experienced it personally) where a small flake of rust will block 
the filter (and the gas flow) sporadically.  The round metal filter is 
supposed to be self-cleaning and last the lifetime of the vehicle, but 
who knows if VW defined &quot;lifetime&quot; as 17+ years?

The other thing you might look into is the resistive track of the Air 
Flow Meter (AFM).  Given enough time this track will wear through, 
causing a &quot;loss of signal&quot; situation to the ECU.  The archives discuss 
ways of fixing this problem.

BTW, many people find long run-on sentences devoid of any punctuation or 
capital letters irritating, so don't be surprised if you get a tart 
remark to this effect.
