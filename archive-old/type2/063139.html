Subject: Down under a '75 Westy, cont'd..

Thanks for the responses, everyone.  One person suggested that it was the
master cylinder, to be confirmed by brake-fluid odor.  Did the comparison,
and found that it is NOT brake fluid, at all.  Quite thick and viscous. 
The clincher - found the master cylinder for certain (very distinctive
shape, shown in St. Muir, Bentley, Haynes, AND Chilton's), several feet
further back, and more to center.

The chunk of mystery metal sits right at the bumper, and very much appears
to correspond to the location of the steering column.  So -- I'll go with
the suggestion that it *is* the steering gear box.  The disk-shaped fellow
up alongside it, and the fact that the linkage to the rest of the steering
system dives under the front pan, threw me off.  Still like to know what
the disk-shaped thingie is.  No hoses or anything attached to it.  I'm
somewhat less concerned now about the grease on the gear box itself.  It's
messy, sure, but it's not leaking heavily enough to spot the floor.

On to the stuck hand brake.  The cable moves freely at the front end of its
conduit.  The back end dives down into the rear-wheel assembly.  Can't get
the wheel off to look closer, though.  Liquid Wrenched the thing to death
and left it to fester overnight.  (I wouldn't have thought that a jerk with
an impact wrench could out-do a 5-foot cheater bar.  No garage that uses
ANYTHING but a torque wrench on those nuts will EVER remove them again.)

While under there, I started trying to figure out what all of the rest of
the leaks back there were.  Volks, it seems that every fluid EXCEPT brake
fluid is dripping out of this beast.  Fuel line from pump to engine
compartment - knew about that.  Engine oil - knew about that, and have some
ideas on it.  (Gonna check the valve gaskets, oil filter, etc.... would
rather not do my first engine-pull in an apartment-complex garage.)

Remember that I said that I had just had the tranny re-built (less than
1000 miles back... and four years)?  S.O.B. is leaking transmission fluid
(distinctly red, no?) enough to form drips.  Would I be justified in being
royally peeved at the chain that did the work?  Or is this some aspect of
garaging the thing for an extended period that I was unaware of?  I need to
check the damned warrantee on that...

Anyway -- just thought y'all would like an update.  And if anyone knows
what the disk-shaped thing beside the steering gear box is, I'm very
curious!  Thanks!
