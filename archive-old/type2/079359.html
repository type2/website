Subject: Re: [T2] speedo adjustment?

&gt;
&gt; Price?
&gt;

Jeez that's why I gave you guys the link :-)

They charge $69.50 for a complete recondition of the VDO mechanical
speedometers.  That includes parts and labor + a warranty.

They had quick turnaround (like within 2 days) however the big wait was for
shipping.  They are in CA and at the time I was in Virginia and I didn't
need it in a hurry so I shipped regular UPS ground service.  Once they got
it they had it for 2 days and shipped it back promptly.

Contact info is on their website, http://www.speedometerplus_dot_com -- no
connection with them except as a satisfied customer.
