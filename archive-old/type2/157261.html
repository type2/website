Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Vents?

Remove the fuel filler cap and stick your finger in
the hole. Feel all the way around the inside of the
opening. Chances are you'll find a rip in the rubber
filler neck hose. BTW - when you find one - I used to
buy a couple extras cuz they were only $6 each! Get
the non- unleaded ones (prolly all that is available)
for about 1/4 the cost of the sleeved-down unleaded
type. Yes, I'm pretty confident that's the &quot;leak&quot;!

&gt; Had Scotty in his Vanagon Carrier behind me on the
&gt; way home from camping
&gt; yesterday.  I was in the '79 Aardvark.  We pulled up
&gt; to a light in
&gt; Cassopolis, Michigan and were stopped on a hill nose
&gt; up.  The light turned
&gt; green and I took off and smelled raw gas.   Scotty
&gt; dialed me up on the cell
&gt; and said he had seen gas dripping out on the right
&gt; side near the exhaust
&gt; pipe. (Yikes!)
&gt; 
&gt; As I think back on the times I have smelled the gas,
&gt; it must have always
&gt; been on a hill.  It doesn't happen all the time,
&gt; either.  The fuel lines are
&gt; all new from the injectors back to the fuel pump
&gt; past the filter to where it
&gt; comes out of the tank.
