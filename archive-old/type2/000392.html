The gear # you seek is at the edge by the teeth.
It could also be a zero.

Subject: [T2] Questions before buying new cam
&gt;I'm about to buy a new cam for my 78 2000cc engine I'm rebuilding.
&gt;According to Bently and Muir I need to check the inner face of the cam
&gt;gear for pitch radius departure numbers +/- 1,2,3 etc. Having checked
&gt;the gear I have found no such marking. So I looked at the gear on a cam
&gt;from a 75 1800cc engine and found no such number? Does this pitch radius
&gt;marking only apply to type 1 engines? Am I not looking in the right
&gt;place? Help me please! I want to get the right part the first time.
&gt;
&gt;The only number I could find on the 2000cc hydraulic cam gear is 021 109
&gt;111C followed by the VW logo, then 8H. What does the 8H mean? The gear
&gt;is riveted to the cam, can it be removed and installed on a new cam?
