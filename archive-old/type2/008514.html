Hey Y'all,
  I have been thinking about getting more power out of the 70 Bus I
have. I am not looking for a lot of power and don't want to use
anything but VW air cooled power. So, I am wondering, I have seen type
4's installed into Bugs and Ghia's and with little mod's would work in
a 70 bus. Woould I be better to hop up my 1600dp to 1915cc or go with
the type 4 swap. I think I could go with a 2.0L and leave it stock or
just a mild cam and dual carbs.
  The type 2 would be a little cheaper to upgrade, but would it last
as long or have the torque? The type 4 convertion kit will cost me and
rebuilding the engine will cost more, but will it be worth it in the
long run?
  I have seen a kit that when installed looks alot like the old type
1/2. This would be nice so it would kind of look stock or close.
   I would love any advice or anyone who has done one or the other.
