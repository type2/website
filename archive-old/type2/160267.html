&gt; Not to mention the electronics involved with just ABS that has
&gt; &gt;morphed into electronic suspensions and drive by wire systems...

&gt; &gt;
&gt; All dandy until 10 yrs from now when it's got some miles on it... I had
&gt; a friend with an adjustable suspension (sport, touring, medium?).
&gt; Shockes were about $500 each and no aftermarket replacements...
&gt;
&gt;
I often (well, not that often...;-) wonder what's to become of all
those 'Sclades, Navigators, etc. when they hit 10-15 years old
and become cheap enough for 17 year olds to get as their first
car...And no money for maintaining two an a half tons of sheet
metal... ;-(
