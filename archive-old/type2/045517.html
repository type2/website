I think the place you might find a hose that big is at a boat store. 
They use those big hoses for boat exhaust lines.

&gt; We've got the going around left hand turns fuel smell that
&gt; I've seen others mention. We think the rubber that connects
&gt; where you insert the gas pump to the hose that goes to the
&gt; tank is cracked. A call to Bus Depot yielded no results.
&gt; Where does one get that part? Are they still available from
&gt; the VW folks themselves? If so, what does one call this
&gt; part?
&gt; 
&gt; Any suggestions appreciated.
