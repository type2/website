Subject: Re: [T2] Undercoating

As regards undercoat, I have sucessfully used
a gallon of plastic (not asphalt, not fiber) roofing tar
reduced with lacquer thinner for brush or spray.
About 5 bucks. plastic drop under, plastic shopping bag
and a rubber band for head gear, and clothes to burn after.
