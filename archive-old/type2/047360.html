Subject: [T2] Engine Paint?

I was wondering what kinds of paints work well for painting the engine
tin, valve covers, top of crankcase, etc. I've seen people use rustoleum
for the job, but I was unsure of its resistance to heat. I want to use
paint that is not only attractive, but safe and practical in protecting
the parts. Thanks.
