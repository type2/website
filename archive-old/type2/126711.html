Subject: Re: [T2] re:    Pertronix questions

Hello Guys     I have seen so many of the pertronix fail it is silly, I tell 
everyone using them to carry a set of points and condser with them.  I 
personally  have been using the Crane units on my customers cars with  only one 
failure in the last 15 years. I have 3 vws running them now one for over 15 years 
still working.  just my 2 cents worth   later and have fun  Mark dearing  salem
