Subject: Caravan to Gathering of the Vibes

Anyone going up to gathering of the vibes outside of albany this weekend?

Anyone want to caravan from parts south?  We'll be leaving Delaware on 
Thursday morning (ish) and coming back at some point on Sunday.  P-mail 
if you're interested.

I'd also love to meet any listees who are gonna be there, so look for my 
blue&amp;white '71 bus with california plates and a big
pine roof-rack and stop by to say hi!
