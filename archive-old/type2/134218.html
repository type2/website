Subject: [T2] Decel Valve


&gt; When manifold vacuum rises to over 20&quot; (when you take your foot off the
&gt; gas) the vacuum coming thru the small hose pulls a diaphram in the can
&gt; open and allows air to flow from the big hose around the throttle to the
&gt; intake air distribution box.  This prevents an ultra-lean condition on
&gt; deceleration and lowers certain pollutants (NOx, I believe).  It also
&gt; accounts for the lack of &quot;engine brake&quot; on FI buses.

Hmmm.... I'd always understood that the decel valve prevents an ultra-rich
situation which ordinarily would occur when you slam the throttle valve shut
by providing air to allow burning of unburned fuel.  The fact that air is
being introduced by the decel valve seems to jibe with this.
