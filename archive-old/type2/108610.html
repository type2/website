Subject: starter problems

Hi everyone - can anyone help?

My van (2 litre aircoooled 1982 manual) has a starter problem.  Plenty of
battery, the solenoid clicks when I turn the key, I think I can hear the relay
clicking, but the motor does not turn.  I have tried a (tested) new motor with
exactly the same results. The motor turns when shorted direct to the battery.
This happened very suddenly - first sign was a faint glow of the red light on
the dash.

As usual, all help gratefully received.

Thanks,

Dave, London UK
