Subject: Re: [T2] muir and the 1.7, 1.8, &amp; 2L cranks

&gt; i read in muir that one way a torque a flywheel sans the proper flywheel
&gt; lock is to get a rag on the teeth of a monkey wrench and apply that
&gt; sandwich to the fan hub while someone up front sockets down the five bolts


I did something a little more dastardly. I took a metal rod that fit one of
the bolt holes for the preasure plate inserted it all the way through until
the rod went through to the inspection hole on the case. then torqued away.
worked well and I dont think I damaged anything.
