Fred -

Wasn't there a cool option on Rivera's for an awning that was housed under
the pop-top affixed to the inside of the fiber-glass - when the top is up it
rolled out from underneath the pop-top over the top of the rain gutter, then
attached to poles and guy-wires?  I've heard about them but never seen them.
Maybe there's an aftermarket product that could be rigged to do the same?

&gt; Some of the members of WetWesties have had less than satisfactory results
&gt; with gutter mounted roll-up awnings.  One has had to rig a tarp over the
&gt; awning and housing to prevent rainwater from entering the bus through an
&gt; open sliding door, thus rendering the expensive awning superfluous.
&gt;
&gt; Most of us just rig a tarp to the rain gutter, supported at the outboard
&gt; corners by custom made [ at home :) ] poles and guyed with light line and
&gt; tent stakes/pegs.  Works very well, is inexpensive [spelled C-H-E-A-P],
and
&gt; stows away compactly.
&gt;
&gt; FWIW.....
