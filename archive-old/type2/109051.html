Subject: CV joints nocking sound

Hello guys

Yestarday I was driving my bus down hill and sundely a nocking or clacking
sound start in the driver's side rear wheel, I drove slowly for about two
miles and the sound where there continuosly unless the bus was roling in
neutral or with the cluth depress.
I toke the wheel out and start to turn the whell by hand and notice certain
amont of resistance before the sound comes, I did few turns in order to
identify exactly where the sound coming from, and sundely again the sounds was
gone as fast as did appear.
I am also noticed a dirty mess of oil or grease I am not sure around the cv
joint near the gear box.
Could be a partial dissalignment of the joint due the lost of lubricant or the
joint is dead and have to be replaced, in the last case do I need an idraulic
press to do the job by my self, accordind to the bentley manual.

Thanks in advance

Roberto
