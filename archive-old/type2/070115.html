Roadtripped into Oklahoma to look for the above yesterday...and found it.
Bob, was that you I passed?

It's got a lot of rust, but if I had a trailer and the burning desire to own
a '57 panel, I'd go for it. Well, okay, I have the desire. I just don't have
the trailer and the time. It was reported to be a '56 to me. I got the VIN
number, though:  315429.

It was apparently bus number 221 for 1957, since the numbers start at
315209. Pretty low number and a little coincidental since it's a type 21.

my numbers show the bus as a jan of 58 production

So now for the obligatory question: Just how rare would a '57 DD Walkthru
be? 
- - - - 
pretty rare to find early walk throughs (62 and earlier).   a double door
panel early walk through is rarer.   ive seen one- a  Jeff Slater is
restoring it.   a stamped bumper walk though DD panel is rarer.   

What could you get for one in excellent condition (a range would be
fine)? The guy's reputed to be asking $700 for this one, but I wouldn't pay
that much and I'm almost positive that cash could talk him down. 
- - - - - - 
does it have the correct front and rear bumpers- the thin ones with the
raised bits and no overriders?    does it have a decklid with no hump above
the liscense plate place.?   does it have the drivers seat  - those frames
are hard to find,  does it have the round glass taiillights?    does it have
windows in the doors(it shouldn't) . rust in tthe sub floors?  sounds like a
nice project if you like the bus

 Whoever
attempts to restore this will have to put several thousand into it to get it
right...and lots of sweat equity. Front and back windows (that's all except
the doors) are missing; engine lid missing. pretty straight body, but lots
of surface rust and some rocker damage. Bound to be damage inside, but it
was grown over and I had the kids with me. For a better-condition bus I'd
have done some more investigation, but this one is beyond my current skill
level
