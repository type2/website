Subject: Re: [T2] 76 resale value

Hmmm.... I've been offered $10,000 for my '79 sunroof Kombi on the spot.
Rust free and nicely painted (but not perfect) with incomplete interior. And
dare I say I turned it down without hesitation?

&gt; You know, I just put up an ad for my friend's 76 westy that was in ok
&gt; condition..


&lt;snip&gt;

interior needed a bit of work and the exterior paint was
&gt; quite faded and there were areas that needed work.  Yet, it sold for
&gt; 2950 in a heartbeat.  I wouldn't be surprised if a late bay westy goes
&gt; for 4-5k, if not more.  That's pretty neat that our buses are holding
&gt; value.
&gt;
&gt; Just thought I'd mention that tidbit of info...
