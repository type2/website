Lealon,

I believe your problem is that the rear end of your Westy is sagging.  I had 
the same problem until I reset the rear torsion bars to raise it back up.  
The angle shifted back and I have no problem looking out the rear window.  
With the rear up, the front end in front of the axle angles lower.   Also, 
when fully loaded with passengers and gear, the front end is now the one that 
tends to bottom out first.
