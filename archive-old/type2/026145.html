Subject: I can't stand the rain ... 'gainst my window

Hi all,
I have a problem with rain.  Well, not the rain itself but the way it comes
through the air vents in my cab doors (you know, those plastic louvres with
the blue knob down by the seat base).  I'm sure rain isn't supposed to come
in there but it does.  There's no way I can stop it coming into the door
around the window, but I would like it to exit through the drain holes at
the bottom.  I don't see a way of doing this without covering up the hole
behind the door panel.  I would like to fit some carpet under the seats
eventually but this is stopping me.  Any ideas out there?
