Subject: Ken Hooper, advise please

Ken!Thanks for the handholding when I needed it!  I'm new to the world of VW
(and to the NET too, I've been out of touch with technology recently due to
a career change).  What I need to know is who is Mark Stephens and how do I
contact him?  It appears that putting the proper heads on this engine is the
way to go - I guess that the world is full of opinionated advice, even from
supposedly reputable VW shops.  One more question: should I also install an
oil cooler?  This bus will see a lot of high altitude use (this is Colorado
afterall) and I know that the thinner air is less efficient in transfering
heat away from the engine.  I've been a lurker once removed from this page
for awhile (my boyfriend reads it and brings printouts home to me. I suspect
that it was all a plot to get me into computers again and to prep me for the
inevitable reality that I'll be doing the majority of the mechanics, and yes
I am a girl!  I rebuilt a fiat many years ago, I pray that VW's are better
designed ;) )  Specifically the various sermons I've read lead me to think
that not having an oil cooler on these larger engines constitutes bus abuse.
This bus is in excellent shape interior and body-wise, and I'd like to do
right by it.
