FYI:  I bought some Vredstein snow tyres this winter for my 78 Westy.  I
have been very happy with them and thought I might pass some information
along to the group.  Info from the tyre is as follows:

VREDSTEIN
Transport Snow
185R14C102/100N
8 Ply Rating Radial
Made in Holland
LT Load Range D
Max Load single 1875 LBS_at_65PSI COLD
MAX LOAD DUAL 1765_at_65PSI COLD
Sidewall: 2 Plies Rayon
Tread: 2 Plies Rayon + 2 Plies Steel + 1 Ply Nylon

Here's a link to their website, check out the photo of the Transport and
the tyre tread.  Seems these were made for the Transporter.  I must say,
the tread is pretty bomber, and looks cool on your Veedub.
