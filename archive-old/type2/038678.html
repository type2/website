Subject: Re: EFI sputtering

Loose or dying Temp Sensor II.  Located over the top of cyl #3.  Most likely
loose.  Common problem, easy fix. 14mm end wrench.  Flashlight.

&gt; Problem with 77 Westy with EFI...
&gt; After driving down the highway for about the 20 minutes my engine starts
&gt; sputtering eventually cuts out. If I wait 10 minutes or so it will run fine,
&gt; but in maybe another 10 minutes it sputters and eventually dies an ugly
&gt; death. It starts subtly with a few misses and gets more and more harsh. Kind
&gt; of like running out of gas.
&gt; 
&gt; The amount of time the engine runs is directly proportional to the amount of
&gt; ride time I get until the sputtering starts. Any ideas?
