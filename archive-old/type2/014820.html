Hot VWs has a good write-up in the Dec 2000 issue page 82. It covers how to
replace a broken stud and your options.

Subject:	[T2] Stud?

Hello All,

I noticed an increase in my exhaust noise the other day and went through
everything ensuring all was tight.  Turns out one of my exhaust studs on
ole #3 is stripped and will not allow me to tighten my j-tube down.

I did a quick search at lunch of the archives but didn't see whether a
helicoil or other type fix could be accomplished with the head installed.
Any suggestions?

Thanks in advance!
