Subject: Re: [T2] Sliding Window Gaskets

Bus Depot said:
&gt; &gt; Incidentally, we carry new OEM sliding windows for busses (as well as
new European made seals), for anyone who prefers new to used. $132.95
each for the windows (parts 56631and 56632, left and right respectively.)

And Andy asked:
&gt; Ron do they come with screens?

78/79 buses with OEM sliding windows never came with screens.
ASI Riviera campers did, but they were not OEM sliders.
I have seen odd 78/79 campers, that used OEM sliders instead of the Westy jalousie windows, with screens that
were bolted on the outside of the front sliding half glass. They used long hex-head sheet metal screws that
went thru the seal and thru the sheet metal of the body. They were a permament install. If you took them off,
you were left with holes....

Vanagon Westies did come with screens. They snapped in place from the inside. VW made two different sliders
for Vanagons: passenger sliders and Westy sliders. The difference is where the lock knob is: passenger is at
the front corner, Westy is 14 1/2&quot; back from the corner. This is to allow you to open/close the slider with
the screen in place.
