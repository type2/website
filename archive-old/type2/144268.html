Subject: Re: [T2] Yet Another Clutch Cable

Don,

The problem is usually that:
(A) the hole in the &quot;dogbone&quot; lever is rough or
(B) that the pin is worn or
(C) that the pin was not greased during installation (which causes A &amp; B)

The solution is to replace the lever and pin along with the clutch cable
and GREASE THAT PUP!!!!

The pin should rotate *only* in the lever arm. If the pin is worn or
rotates in the locking clamp (arm) it should be replaced.  If the hole in
the lever is worn or rough it should also be replaced.

I have seen new levers at swapmeets.  I have also seen the short-arm clip
pins for bugs.  I have not seen the long-arm clip pins that fit the bus
clutch cables in a while, but I am sure that one of our esteemed
compatriots (hint, hint) can point you to a source for the proper clip pin
and a mail order source for the lever,

OOK!
