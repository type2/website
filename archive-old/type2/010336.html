&gt; Good to hear you are satisfied on your caliper  (I cut my finger last

&gt; 
&gt; I BELIEVE the calipers for the '71 and '72 are a smaller size than
&gt; the ones 
&gt; for the '73 - '84.  (See Ron's BusDepot page.  Search on 'caliper')
&gt; 
&gt; Some people would prefer the larger '73 - '8X calipers and associated
&gt; pads.  
&gt; But what about the rotors; does the '71 rotor fit with the '73 - '8X 
&gt; caliper.  Possibly NOT..

The rotors don't swap.  They have a different offset.  To do a brake
swap you need to replace the spindles, rotors, calipers, and associated
hardware.

Oddly, the brake pads are the same shape.  The thickness was increased
on the later model pads for greater durability, which was the whole
point of the swap!  Unfortunately, It seems that '71 (thin) pads are
being sold as &quot;universal&quot; replacements for the later models as well,
negating the advantage of the larger calipers!  Shop around!
