Subject: $10 worth of VW parts

Folks,

Went to an auction yesterday. A local garage was selling all it's 
workshop equipment. I wanted a floor jack but they went for too much. Got 
a pop rivet gun for $10.

Item 140 of 143 was &quot;VW Parts&quot;. I had a look and said to a friend &quot;If I 
was doing a beetle, I'd probably buy this lot&quot; 

Anyway, auctioneer got to Item 140 and called for bids. I said &quot;$10&quot;. No 
other bids, it's all mine. I said to my friend &quot;Bloody hell what am I 
going to do with this lot? I'm going to be in the s**t when Sue (SO finds 
out)&quot;. &quot;Where are you going to put it?&quot; she will say.  

I now own one 36 &amp; one 40hp motor, a type 3 motor (none going), 2 beetle 
bonnets, 2 left front doors, 2 '60s beetle bumpers, 2 fuel tanks, 2 
rubbish beetle seats, 2 excellent beetle high back seats, assorted bits 
of shrouding and three cartons of assorted parts including brand new 
Brosol fuel pump (A$42), beetle clutch and throttle cables.

So far I reckon I've got over $400 of things I can use when I do up a beetle.

I believe that the type 3 engine case may be able to be used as a 
replacement for the cracked case I'm running now.

And Sue has already forgiven me!
