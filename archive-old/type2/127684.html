Subject: Re: [T2] Listees ? Vintage and Type II

&gt; Just wondering why the Type II list is always twice as long as the Vintage
&gt; list ?
&gt;
&gt; The Vintage owners can keep the Splitties running without much help ?
&gt;
&gt; Or are there just fewer Splitties around ?


Maybe because the 68-71 people subscribe to both? And the vintage only
people and T4 bussers do not?
