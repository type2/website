&gt; 3. Speaking of acetone, it's a favorite solvent for those of us who have

Well it can't be all that bad, since women apply it directly to their skin
all the time.

Acetone is also called &quot;Nail Polish Remover!&quot;

It also dissolves cyanoacrylate &quot;super&quot; glues.  I keep a jar of acetone
with a few superglue nozzles soaking in it.  When a CA nozzle
clogs, just swap it for a nice clean one and toss the clogged nozzle
in the bottle.  Much easier than poking the things with pins, etc.
