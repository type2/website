Hiya Keith,

It's not a &quot;come-on&quot; by the folks at Restomotive.  To make sure that POR-15 
really does the job you want it to, you have to follow their instructions to 
the letter.  That means following their three-step program for application.  
If you do that, without any deviation, that stuff will be doing its job long 
after you are dead and gone.

Mike
