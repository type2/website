		O.K. So you read of my little crash and know I have been
looking for another Westy anyway. Well now it seems I will have to get
serious about this. 
		I am looking for a 76-79 Westy, and will look at an 80-8?
Vanagon Westy if the price is right. I would like to get a Delux, with the
propane stove and fridge. I would like one that has a good body, but need
not be perfect, good running motor would be nice, but will look at anything
complete(I have 6 spare type 4 motors). I would prefer original F.I. But
will consider carbs too. 
		I have found a few Rivearas in the area, but have not looked
at them yet. I need to research them a little more first. However, if you
have a nice one, I will consider it too.
		The Bus needs to be located in the NW, better yet in the
Tacoma/Seattle area. 
		My 71 Bus still runs a drives fine, but it had some rust and
body damage before, and now knowing that it will not meet my needs camping,
this little extra body damage just frustrates me more. I will be selling or
parting out the 71. If you are interested in the whole Bus, or the SO-69
interior, let me know. I can send pictures of it in its current
condition.(e-mail digital pics)
