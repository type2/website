&gt; &gt;I pulled a brake servo out of a '78 bus in a junk yard and have a
&gt; &gt;question about one of the hoses that attached to it.  One hose attaches
&gt; &gt;to the metal servo unit and that is for the vacuum.  The other attaches
&gt; &gt;in the front where the brake lever push rod attaches to the unit.  The
&gt; &gt;hose winds up and into the body and disappears into the door pillar.  I
&gt; &gt;have looked through my bentley and cannot find any reference to this
&gt; &gt;tube other than showing it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;What is it for?
&gt; &gt;Where does it go?
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; The front hose is clean air for the diaphragm to move. In a passenger car
&gt; that end of the booster is inside the car. In order for the booster to work,
&gt; that side must be vented to the atmosphere or it wouldn't move. Since that
&gt; end is pointed forward and all the road dirt and water would go into it, a
&gt; line is installed and it goes into the body at the bottom rear corner of the
&gt; channel below the drivers door.
&gt;

Karl,

Thanks for the quick and detailed reply.

Scott
