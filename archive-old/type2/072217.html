Subject: no pressure built during brake bleed

i set up in the archives but couldn't get posts to load....?? looked like
great help with my keywords, but they just won't load for me just now. who
knows - i had the same problem with the buy and sell for a week. anyway -
subject says it all. most all of the air is purged from the lines to the
four wheels. nevertheless, no pressure at all on the brake pedal;
practically nothing. is this a case of air in the master cylinder? a shot
m/c? this is on a 68.   what is the proceedure? - steve
