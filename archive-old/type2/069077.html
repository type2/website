Subject: wiper question

Hiya
On my '74 bus the windsheild wiper lever on the column has 4 positions,
but only the top 2 do anything. I assume 1 of the other 2 is off.
Anyone know what the other position should do?

As a side note, I received a new Harbor Freight today
and they have dropped the price on their non-gas using
flux core wire MIG welder to $149!!!!!!! PLEASE Honey........
