What, still only 227,000?  You have been there for a couple of months 
now.  Not driving the bus much lately?  :)  I'm up to 92,000 miles on my 
current engine and 192,000 total vehicle miles (well, could be 292,000 but 
I really doubt it).  Yep, I managed to time it such that I installed the 
new engine at 99,7xx miles so it is real easy to remember how many miles 
are on it.  Now what was my point?  Oh yeah, I've never touched the rear 
bearings - that's the 13 years and 135,000 miles that I've owned 
it.  Probably haven't been touched since 1973.  Oh, during the last 13 
years I have had at least two front bearing failures - always the left 
front for some reason.  I've been fortunate enough to hear them starting to 
go and change them before they got too bad.  Latest one was immediately 
upon arrival in Texas after driving from California, when my bus was my 
only transportation and I was living out of a motel room.  Got to swap that 
one out in a parking lot in the hot sun.  Culprit was rust from water 
leaking in, presumably through the dust cap or speedometer cable 
hole.  Still haven't fixed the underlying problem but I feel pretty safe 
since I carry new bearings and seals wherever I go and check them before 
long trips.

When I was in Las Vegas a couple of years ago, Meyers Foreign (A very, very 
good VW shop!) told me I could leave the rear bearings alone if they were 
not giving me trouble.  I wanted them to repack the rears since I had never 
had it apart, but they said failures are rare and I should hear a problem 
long before it leaves me stranded.  So that's what I did - freed up money 
for other more pressing projects.  The rear bearings make me a little 
nervous though since they are a complete unknown.  I need to address that 
fear eventually.
