&gt; shut it down for a while,

Cute Bill!
I'm of the opinion that one can cause WAAY more damage to one's engine
by leaving off the flaps and thermostat than many of you recognize.
Oil really needs to get warm (175degrees F+) to boil off water. WATER?
Yeah, h2o and co2 are the prime products of combustion. Whatever blowby
you have will be part water and if the engine is warm it'll boil off
pretty rapidly. Ever see that baby-poo stuff in your filler cap? Water!
The flaps have NOTHING to do with the heating system of the car (oh, I
give, maybe a little to do with the air pressure served up at the heat
exchangers).
The heater of the car is dependent upon the exhaust gas temperature (and
volume). Anyone who's driven an airplane knows EGT is dependent upon
mixture (and timing of course, but we've all got that subject completely
resolved).
I realize that brand new Mexi-beetles use no flaps but I suffer under
the belief that they do have temperature control via the FI. Yes, and
it's a different FI than 75&amp; later U.S. Beetles had.
The average temperature difference of cooling air between southern US
and northern US makes a lot more difference to humans than to air-cooled
engines.
I know a little bit about VW motors and what I really know is that I
don't have the knowledge and wind tunnels and manometers (well, I do
have one manometer) and temp recorders and test tracks to re-engineer
this part of this motor.
The only temp related failures I've had were directly related to
too-lean FI problems. The one 2 liter that I had the best time with
spent many occasions with its speedo needle in the 95-100 area and lived
to tell about it (it's still here but, alas, no body to put it in.)
One other thing: on 912E Porsche, they provided oil temp guages, but no
oil pressure. (I've got one, if anybody wants to know about the location
of the sender.) 356 Porsche was the same.
I guess they figured if the oil pressure was low enough for  the lite to
wink at idle, maybe it's time to worry, otherwise, don't worry about it.
(Later cars became more anal)
your mileage may vary,
