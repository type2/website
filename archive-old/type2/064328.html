Subject: Trip To W. Lebanon Show (and Vt.)

Hi Bill-  (and list Members) took the 10 yr old and SO and the trusty 78
Westy (175K mi on orig. engine) to West Lebanon, NY Bug Jam, where we met
Donna Rich, who I know from the free BB days of Prodigy.  The wet stuff
held off until about 2:30, and they canned the finals of the eighth mi
heats, calling the last 2 guys a &quot;tie&quot;, but refusing to share, they ran the
race with each PUSHING their vehicles (rabbit and bug) down the track- the
bug won.....(:  The attendance was sparse, only 2 splitty busses shown, and
a nicely detailed yellow and white '71 Camper customized by the owner.
Picked up a mint 75 manual and two VW key blanks for the 75 bus resto,
didn't see any heater boxes (hardly ever see any pancake engine stuff) or
lenses I'm watching out for.  They had about 6 Westies there; 3 really nice
shaped ones.  We entered for fun, put up the tent (under awning), calling
ours the one with most character and most miles in still original
(unrestored) condition as a daily driver.
     Saw the same green Westy (140K mi) by this old couple from Tom's River
that's in very good shape (claim it's original paint); they got 2nd at Atco
(where there is no Westy class); probably got a prize here but we cut out
because we wanted to get to Burlington, Vt before 8 pm.   One advantage of
setting up the tent under the awing is you stay dry breaking it down and
folding it up!  Got lots of rain, and wipers cut out about an hr to go.
The sound of the whirring motor told me my epoxy fix on the motor shaft
drive gear had quit after 4 yrs of service, so I must pull it!  May finally
get to use that spare ass'y I've carryied all these yrs!!!  Didn't bother
to do it in Vt. beause we use rain-X (almost never need wipers in daytime)
and it cleared up Sun. for a great trip to Shelburne Museum- finding out
how they hauled a paddle steamer there and all those buildings (like a 50
ton jail) is as much fun as touring it.  If you got kids over 6 they will
LOVE the circus models.  The Shelbourne is a PARK with collections of
Americana stored there in original buildings moved there.
    The Westy drove fine (65 mph average) and THE DAMN RATTLE I GOT AFTER
REVVING UP IS GONE- maybe replacing the heater box and two lifters did the
job?  The exhaust noise is still there, manifold-head connection I'm sure,
but only rust is holding on the nuts, and I know stud ends will strip if I
try to get them off, so I'll wait.  Long enough post, I'm outta here, may
go to Englishtown show (*NJ).......MB
