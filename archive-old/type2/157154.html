Subject: [T2] PDX 2.0L FI Rebuild Question

The bus:  79 2.0 FI Federal.  Has bottom-end problems
with cylinders 1 and 3, as is likely to need
rebuilding.  Nationally, I`m aware of Boston Bob, JCS,
TIICO, AVP, Vege, others.  But the owner is not one to
remove the engine, box it, and ship it off.  He wants
the vehicle towed and fixed.  So, the question
becomes, what local Portland, Oregon shop or shops are
recommendedk?  He has taken his bus to M&amp;M before.
    
I have yet to point out to him that since the bad
cylinders are 1 and 3, that heat is a likely candidate
cause.  Compression is 30 on both 1 and 3; could be a
simple head issue.  But want a reputable mechanic to
make that determination.
