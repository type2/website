Well, I drove The Terrapin Flyer today after letting
her rest for the weekend and now I'm getting a noise
that (from checking the archives) sure sounds like it's
one of the CV joints. I don't have a problem working
on it, but want to make sure. First question is: Can
this happen overnight? There was *no* previous sign of
any kind of noise like this. It is speed sensitive, 
starting as a low growl/grind, then working its way 
up (with speed) to a knock. Second, is there anything
else this could be? I swear I hear it coming from the
dash, but I really can't pinpoint it. It fills the
whole bus.
