Sorry, bad choice of words (never was very good with this writing lark).  I
meant &quot;obviously&quot; in the sense that I wouldn't be doing the adjustment if I
had hydraulic lifters.  I only put that bit in so that I could avoid getting
flamed by people saying &quot;You have a 78, you *must* have hydraulic lifters&quot;.
Trust me, they are as solid as they come.  I think  it was standard over
here.  &quot;Don't trust dem new fangled high-drollick fings, I don't.  They're
not natural.&quot;

&gt; Maybe i'm asking fot it or showing my ignorance, but aren't 
&gt; most &quot;type 4, 2 litre engines&quot; hyd lift? How is it 
&gt; &quot;obviously...solid lift...&quot; could be only the U.S. If i'm 
&gt; just ignorant of this, you can hit me in the head with one of 
&gt; these solid lifters. ;]
