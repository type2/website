Subject: RE: [T2] Disappearing Brake Fluid

&gt;There are no brake fluid
&gt;stains on the floor under the van.

The fluid is going SOMEWHERE you just have to do some serious crawing 
underneath your bus to find out where. It may not be apparent. Check the 
rear wheels, you could have a leaking cyilnder and it could be leaking into 
the drum.  Fill up the res and pump the hell out of the system then start 
investiage the entire system.


&gt;Is this the old 'brake fluid drains into
&gt;the brake vacuum booster' problem?

I haven't heard of this happening but if it was it could probably damage the 
diaphram in the servo. Keep fingers crossed on this.

&gt;Is it new master cylinder time?
Take a very good look at yours. Any wetness and replace it. If it is totaly 
rusted crusted up I would replace it. (I just ordered one for my 71 and it 
was only $30), it's working fine but I'm replacing the booster and figure 
might as well do the master.


&gt;What
&gt;about the brake booster?
Does braking affect engine idle at all? If you hear hissing it's definately 
toast. If braking kills engine it's probably toast. If it raises idle it 
might be toast soon or a leak in the hoses from engine to booster. A faulty 
booster will NOT be a cause of leaks.
