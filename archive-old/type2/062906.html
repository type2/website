Subject: Seek parts coating

  Many of you have seen this thick brown waxy coating they put on 
gears and such for long term storage. Peels off for use part.

 Living in the rain belt, I really have a need, yet the product eludes
me.

 What I'm looking for would ideally be painted on with a brush or dipped. To
be used on everything from threads exposed under the car
to spare parts for rust and ding protection.

 Anyone with clues or ideas ?       west
