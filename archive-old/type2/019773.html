In my overkill method, I used #00 welding wire for the hot lead to the battery.
No voltage drop there.  Cleaned off a spot on the sheet metal to bare metal,
both sides, 8 MM bolt with oversize washers, locktight first nut, regular flat
washer, cable end, flat washer, nylock nut,  Sprayed all bare metal with battery
terminal protecterant.  Add to maintenance list.  Bolted universal battery tray
to body sheet metal and used a universal battery holddown setup.  Worked for me.
