Subject: vent flap control for fan housing

fan housing came with out the bar to control the vents.  although i have 
heating no longer id like to know if i keep the u bar in the back of the 
housing to the left if it will keep the vents on the bottom of open all the 
way as what looks like to be pictured in the bentley manual.  so basically 
could it do just as well with out this piece?  
i send this to you bekleysue because i havent gotten any responses from the 
type 2 server.  also i want to let you know that i got the engine timed 
properly and thats what was causing the bad ignition.  
another point is i have an oil leak underneath coming from a large screw type 
bolt that has a straight screw driver type of slit in it.  can you tell me 
why there is oil coming from this place.  i mean it is a brand new rebuild.  
several oil drips are coming from the oil pan.  just snug the nuts up?  this 
rather annoying lol there should be no oil leaks!

thanks.
