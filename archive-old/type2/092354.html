Subject: Re: Help with distributor installation, seal question

Hi Matthew:
Thanks for the quick reply

There is a flat rubber washer on the distributor body that seals the sides of
the distributor, but according to Bentley's there is also a round O-ring seal
that goes between the distributor and the drive gear. Around the spacer
spring. That is missing on mine and I am not sure if I have to remove the
drive gear to replace it or if it just sits on top of the gear.

&gt; the o-ring is more of a flat o-rng than the traditional round one. It
&gt; goes on the distributor shaft, about 1&quot; or so down from the top (so a
&gt; ways up the shaft!). It goes in a groove. Be sure to put a tad of oil on
&gt; the ring when you slide it on the shaft and then the shaft into the
&gt; block.  The groove is about 3/16&quot; wide and not to deep.
