I've got a metal manifold arrangement for my
quattro-gage senders (original pressure switch, dual
VDO, and an oil temperature sender.  From what I
recall, the part going into the block was like NPT
except I wonder if it wasn't a metric equivalent.  I
spent some time fiddling with junk box parts to come
up with the piece that finally fit the block.

My manifold is all solid pipe, but a problem occurs if
it doesn't tighten down in the right position because
some of the other side mounted gages interfere with
the distributor.  The solution is trial and error,
plus the addition/removal of teflon tape on the block
adapter threads.  Also, I have to remove the sideways
mounted gages to get the manifold on or off, but that
really only needs to be done when doing major engine
work.

I'm not familiar with the type of fittings you
described, but I'm assuming you are using a flexible
teflon hose to connect to the block.  Does the teflon
resist pressure well?  Where do you get the parts you
described?
