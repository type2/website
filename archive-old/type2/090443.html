Subject: Re: [T2] Rhino-lined engine compartment? (2)

Well, the area around the battery tray has quite a bit
of rust. I have a new battery tray to put in. I'm
thinking I should POR-15 the whole area, then do the
rhino-lining. Good news: I found a local guy who does
it. Info on Rhino-lining: It will stand up to 194* F
of continuous heat. It can go up to 248* F before it
starts getting &quot;mushy.&quot; Even then, it shouldn't drip,
unless it gets really hot. Would an engine compartment
on an air-cooled bus get that hot? With those
temperatures, it would practically be an oven. He uses
a two-part self-etching primer before the lining. He
said that a small truck bed is $350. He said that mine
probably wouldn't use as much material, so it would
cost less. He is going to stop by here and ascess my
rust damage and tell me what I should do. My thoughts
are that I want the rust annihilated (I like that
word). It has started to rust through in, like, two or
three dime-sized patches under the tail light.
Hmmmmm... Any thoughts on rust removal in that area,
engine compartment temperatures, etc, etc, etc?
                                Thank you all,
                                Paul Deatherage

&gt; I
&gt; would POR-15 the holy crap out of it. Well, do you
&gt; think I should do it? It would certainly have
&gt; sound-deadening capabilities as a pleasant
&gt; side-effect...
