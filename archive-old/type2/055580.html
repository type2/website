I picked up a pair of the extra long pop-out latches for my 67 deluxe
today at the Goodguys show here in Nor Cal.  When I swapped them for my
short ones, I couldn't get the latches to lock shut.  They would lock in
the open position fine but not closed.  I did try it with and w/out the
spacer on the body side but it still doesn't lock shut.  Are these
things not a straight swap like I thought they would be or am I missing
something?

It should be  a straight swap.  You could try adjusting how they attach to the
pop out frame, to give the latch a little more clearance.
