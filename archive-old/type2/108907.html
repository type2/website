Subject: RE: [T2] Champagne edition bus (any owners on the list?)

Interesting as my father's Champagne edition (has that little sticker) has a
black dash like my 79 westy, none of the brown stuff. Even the interior is a
tan velour, not brown and no stripe kit. But the colors are brown and a
darker tan color on top. Maybe the 77 was just slightly different and in 78
they went full force in the 70's brown? No intermittent wipers or anything,
but it is a Champagne edition with the chrome bumpers. Hmmm.
