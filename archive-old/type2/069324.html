Subject: Re: Removing door panels II (fixing the window)

&gt;I need is called a &quot;door regulator&quot; however they didn't have one for a bus
only a bug. I'd like to be able to 
&gt;fix the one I've got but I don't know if that's possible. It looks all
sealed, like it was welded or press fit 
&gt;together. Any advice???

I remember once taking one of these apart for the same reason but it was a
long time ago and I don't remember exactly what I did with it to get it
working again. (BTW, it was on a '74 bus but they are probably the same) It
seemed to work fine but shortly after doing this I found a good SH
replacement so I swapped them over and still have the repaired one as a spare.
I drilled out the rivets that hold together the little box-type-thing that
houses the winder spindle. Be careful when you open it up because there is a
sort of spring clutch on the spindle that stops the window being forced
open. The rack inside the tube will probably have worn teeth or the 'box'
will have bent as a result of trying to force a stiff window. You can now
adjust the box with a big hammer/vice grips to get the teeth meshing fully
or you can move the rack to use an unworn portion. I used some small bolts
to replace the rivets. The worst bit was getting the regulator in and out of
the door - a right pig of a job!
