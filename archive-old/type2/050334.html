Subject: [T2] timing a '70 bus with an AD engine

does anyone know what the best timing for a 1970 bus with a AD code engine
would be?  I can't seem to find a definitive answer... i've performed a
tuneup... and the valve clearance and dwell are set perfectly, but now it
performs much worse than before.  extrapolating from various sources seem to
indicate:

Static timing at either 0 or 7.5 degrees (Muir)

dynamic timing at 30 degrees full advance (type2_dot_com) (that would be 1.75&quot;
btdc plus a smidge measured around the diameter of the pulley)

i'm leaving for a 1000 mile road trip tomorrow afternoon, so i'd love to
sort it out and not burn out a head or anything....

thanks in advance... dodger
