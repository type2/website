&gt; I've got a '69 Westy and I can't figure out exactly how big the gas tank is.
&gt; The PO told me around 10.something gallons, which I know is wrong and
&gt; Bentley says it is 15.something gallons, but I don't think it is that big.
&gt; When my fuel gauge reaches the &quot;R&quot; at the bottom, how much is left in the
&gt; tank?  I filled up the other day when the gauge was just above the &quot;R&quot; and
&gt; it took 11.5 gallons.
