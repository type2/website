Subject: Another sticker idea...

I was just perusing my 600+ messages that I let build up for a
few weeks, and came across this perfect sticker idea.  It was
in reference to something else, but has been modified to suit
what we all know and love:

&gt;       &quot;If this &lt;bus&gt; was a horse, sometimes I'd swear I'd have to shoot &gt;it.&quot;
&gt;

And remember:  you can lead a splitty to water, but you can't make it 
drink.
