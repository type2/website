Subject: [T2] tranny stuck

i replanted a donor tranny to replace a known dead guy. all i did with the
donor was change out the main seal, throwout bearing fork &amp; bushings; axle
shaft seals; and removed the nose cone to replace seals, bushings and
gasket. i did not go any further.

i put everything in the nose cone as i found them in the original that was
replaced. the only thing i can think of is the &quot;click sound&quot; made when i
slid the hockey stick to meet into the set screw upon installation. but i
had to do that so it would reach. all the time i was careful not to take it
out of whatever gear it was in up front at the shifter.  clutch is
adjusted. engine is in but electric and fuel lines are not hitched. should
i go ahead and finish that up, get it running, and hope things click - or
stop now and pull it apart....?
stuck. any clues?
BIGthanks - steve
