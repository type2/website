Subject: Protraining Manual 

Anybody have a link to a scanned copy of the Protraining Manual? Chris at 
Monkeybrains can't find the name to it. Greg Potts is having server trouble 
and I just can't seem to find a copy of it anywhere in paperback, hard 
bound, CD-Rom, DVD, wav. file, pdf, jpeg, at this point I would settle for a 
reel to reel.

Thanks,

Michael Knight
