&gt; I recently looked for one of these, and so far I have
&gt; heard that they are not available, go to a junkyard,
&gt; and that they are &quot;obsolete&quot;.


I haven't had any problem getting them new, and as I recall they're not even
all that expensive. They're in my catalog and on my website.  I get them
from VW, so if you're in a hurry you can probably get your dealer to order
you one for a few bucks more than I charge.
