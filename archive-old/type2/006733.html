&gt;I went through the same thing with one of my Triumph sports cars.  Get thee
&gt;to your local Loews or Home Depot and grab a big ass roll of &quot;roofing

&gt;is designed to prevent water and ice damage to roofs in the Northern half of
&gt;the country - get it anywhere in Canada... a 75 foot rool is about that many

Dave, can you give us more info on this product?  Manufacturer, 800# or e-mail
address, or something.  Us Listees down here below the Mason-Dixon Line do not
have access to this product via Lowe's &amp; Home Deopt.  I suspect that we would
have to go directly to a distributor and have a roll of it shipped to us.  That
is, unless someone up North would be willing to UPS a roll of it to one/some of
us, but I asked about that before and got no response

Another possibility for soundproofing material might be the 2'x2' rubber tiles
that are put down on the floors of weight lifting rooms in Gyms.  Don't know
anything about them except I was at the Spa today and saw them on the floor and
thought to myself, &quot;Hmmmmmmmmmmm&quot;.
