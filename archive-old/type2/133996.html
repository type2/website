Subject: Re: oil pump removal

&gt;I am in the process of doing a total rebuild on my 71 Westy.  I having heck
&gt;off a time getting the oil pump off.  Any tips or suggestions would be
&gt;appreciated.

sometimes they back out with creative force, but recently i borrowed a
correct puller from an acvw mechanic and it was heavenly.  if you can get
the short block into a truck and bring it down you'd save yourself a return
trip too.   -steve
