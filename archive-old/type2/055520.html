I have friends at work who have dealt with The Tire Rack people.  No
complaints.  I think you can also get the tires already mounted, if you
are buying the rims from them.

Only considerations are price and hazard/wearout warranty.  Expert Tire
(aka, Firestone, I think) gives 100% hazard warranty, decent prices, and
good service. Plus they are national and deal with most brands.

My 1/50 dollar.
