&gt; Three or four years ago, I didn't need my Honda Goldwing anymore.  A good &gt;friend of mine had been begging me to sell it to him so I did.   I've been &gt;trying to get him to sell it back to me.  Well, I finally caught him in a &gt;moment of financial embarrassment  and he sold it to me.  &gt;WHHOOOPPPPEEEEE!   Same price and he did a bunch of upgrades to it. 
 

&gt;Now I have an excuse to get a trailer and a Jamie Rivers hitch set-up and hit the road.  Well, If I could only get out of Chattanooga.  :)  Have a great weekend!  KR   
&gt; 
 

Ahhh,, the point of owning a bike is to ride it....   ;)
I don't make hitches for Goldwings....
so I am assuming you are going to put a hitch on the Bus,, and tow your 
Goldwing??
your motto...??  we haul our rides everywhere.  I won't tell you the acronym 
for that cause I can't spell acronym..
