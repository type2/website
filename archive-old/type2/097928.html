Subject: Engine removal sucessful!

Thanks everyone for your emails and support.

I didn't realize how easy it was to pull the engine, I guess I just thought 
that when I did it with other folks helping, that they were doing all the 
work. I am going to pull the clutch and inspect it, try to find out where the 
culprit is...

On a side note, what is a good way to make your tins look good? a light 
sandblasting and a powdercoat? Any suggestions are welcome, especially the 
ones that work very well, and are inexpensive. (As always)

Talk to y'all soon,

Chris Brooks
