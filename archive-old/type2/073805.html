Subject: DP to SP conversion

I am moving ahead with my project. In the process of stealing tin and intake
from and old SP engine, it occurred to me that I may need the SP rocker
assembly. Does anyone know if they are different? Also, I purchased a new
stock exhaust for the engine. Can I still use it with the SP heads?

Thanks guys.
