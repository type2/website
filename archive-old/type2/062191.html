Hi Volks,

Another source of replacement canvas for poptops of all
years is:

M.L. McCulloch
P. O. Box 2533
Malibu, CA 90265

I have received mail brochures from this guy and also from VW Canvas in Texas 
(see yesterday's list). Prices vary, but TX seems a little cheaper than CA.
But then, CA had a sale once and beat TX prices by a considerable margin, but
that was two years ago and I was a fool not to score one then.

I recall that both offered a &quot;Deluxe&quot; top with windows on the side panels as
well as in the end panel, and that one company did 'em with velcro 
while the other used zippers, but I seem to have misplaced all my old
brochures, so I can't tell which was which. I think CA had zippers.

Almost every time I camp in my poptop, I hear something off to one side
that I'd like to peak at without crawling (naked, often as not)
across the open space forward of the bed to flop out into luggage rack
airspace and crane my head around. Three windows would be awesome.

Whomever you buy from, it's a great idea to buy or borrow a power screwdriver
of some sort to avoid carpal tunnel syndrome, and mind-numbing tedium when
removing and replacing the 157,249 little screws that hold the canvas in place.

Respectfully,
Surfer Bob
