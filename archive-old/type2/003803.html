Subject: Re: [T2] Loose Shifter



&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Is it normal for my shifter to have a lot of free play while in gear?
&gt;
Yes, a lot of play is normal. I fixed mine by putting in a Gene Berg shifter
(very easy job). Pricey, but considering the quality, well worth it. If you
have problems finding gears, you may have to laterally shift the base of the
shifter until you hit the sweet spot where all the gears are easy to find.
&gt;
&gt;I have read stuff here over time about the &quot;shift coupler&quot;
&gt;&gt;and associated &quot;bushings&quot; down there (I'm working from memory here, so
&gt;&gt;please forgive me if my terminology is incorrect) - would these be likely
&gt;&gt;culprits, or is what I'm experiencing sound normal?
&gt;
And yes it was the Shift Coupler that was my
&gt;culprit&gt;I have a '71 and I did go ahead and do the bushings but that means
taking
&gt;the engine and trans completely out where to do the &quot;shift coupler&quot; edging
&gt;those back an inch or so is all that has to be done.
&gt;
I replaced the bushings and the shift coupler in my '71 Westy without
removing the engine and tranny.  I can't remember exactly how I did it, but
I think I took apart the shift rod and slid the pieces past each other to
get the room to work with the parts. YMMV.
