Subject: Re: [T2] Hydraulic clutch

Bob said:
That is a good point.  The first time I replaced a
broken clutch cable it
was dark and I was again underway in 30 minutes. 
Importantly also, the cost
of the cable is only $5.


I've blown the cable on both my busses (once because Id
assembled the wing nut assembly wrong; it only last
about 15 pedal pushes).  In rush hour at a light this
is a real pain.

After those experiences, I occasionally practice to
speed shift.

Start in first, speed up to 4th.

On my 78 its from second to third that is tricky.

By the way getting home in second gear calls for hazard
lights dont forget to keep those running too.

Been cable-less and got home in second!
