Subject: 1980 Westy

Does anyone on the list have any interest in helping a new owner of a 1980
Westy? I have purchased this vehicle and I need some assistance in getting
it street legal. I am mechanically impaired :) but willing to learn. The
situation is:

1. tabs expired need to pass emissions.
2. uses a quart of oil per tank (did not know I bought a 2 stroke)
3. needs lots of tlc.
4. needs tires.
What I am hoping for is to find someone in the Seattle area who would be
willing to mentor a new owner with becoming comfortable with the Westy.  If
anyone is interested or might know of a good shop for a new owner to work
with I would be grateful.

Thanks!

Scott
