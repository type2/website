&gt; &gt;What is wrong with just using the key ignition starter and not 
&gt; &gt;unplugging anything?? that is how i have always done it.
&gt; 
&gt; What are you doing to prevent sparks from jumping from the ends of your
&gt; spark plug wires when you do this?  Still much easier to remove the coil
&gt; hot wire and wrap it in a rag so it won't arc.  Other than that, this
&gt; method works fine.  
&gt; 
&gt; Lately, since I bought an awesome battery charger, I hook it up so as to
&gt; prevent battery drain and help maintain steady cranking speed from #1 -
&gt; #4.  I also usually re-measure #1 at the end of the cycle just for good
&gt; measure.
