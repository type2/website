&gt; I have a 74/T4-1800/manual. On the left side of the fan housing near

&gt; it goes, what it does?

David,

I would bet money that this part of the charcoal canister/gas vapor
system.  It is supposed to have a hose on it that leads to one end of your
charcoal canister and is the feed for air.  The other end of the canister
will have a hose that leads to your air cleaner of about the same
diameter. The canister will also have a small hose that takes gas vapors
from the tank.
