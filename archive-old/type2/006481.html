It's my understanding that ASI, the company that built the Riviera camper
conversions, is still in business in Vancouver, WA.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  I just found black trim that is the same as as what www.trimlok_dot_com
sells
for 30 cents a foot.  I just bought 40 feet for 12 bucks!

I found it at a van conversion shop in Portland Oregon, I looked all over
town, this stuff isn't easy to find.  &lt;&lt;
