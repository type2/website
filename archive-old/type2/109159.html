Subject: Car Thieves

Hey Volks,

An aunt sent me this one.  True or false?  A problem with Audi's and/or VW
buses, or not?

It seems that car thieves have found another way to steal your car or
truck without any effort at all. The car thieves peer through the
windshield of your car or truck, write down the VIN number from the
label on the dash, go to the local car dealership and request a
duplicate key based on the VIN number. The car dealer's parts dept.
will make a duplicate key from the VIN number and collect payment from
the thief who will return to your car. He doesn't have to break in, do
any damage to the vehicle, or draw attention to himself. All he has to
do is to walk up to your car, insert the key and off he goes to a local
chop shop with your vehicle. You don't believe it? It IS that easy. To
avoid this from happening to you, simply put some tape (electrical tape,
duct tape or medical tape) across the VIN label located on the dash
board. By law, you cannot remove the VIN number, but you can cover it
so it can't be viewed through the windshield by a car thief. I urge you
to forward this to your friends before some other car thief steals
another car or truck.
