after a few weeks trying to nail down the source of my 77's tough start /
sometimes un-smooth idle, i finally busted open the air flow meter. sure
enough, there were some worn-through spots on the circuit board contacts, at
precisely the position where the bus idles, as well as all the way at the
bottom (i.e., the &quot;no-air-flow&quot; (starting) position). with 175K miles on the
bus, and no record of the AFM ever having been replaced, i presume this is to
be expected. after checking pricing for replacement AFMs, i rather quickly
determined i would try the move-the-circuit-board trick first. found a nice
set of instructions in the list archives, and followed them. worked great.
don't buy a new AFM unless you do this first.

and a suggestion to any vendors who may be monitoring the list...it would be
really nice (and hopefully much less expensive) to be able to purchase a
replacement for just the circuit board, rather than the entire AFM assembly.
particularly since that is the one part that seems to cause the bulk of AFM
problems.
