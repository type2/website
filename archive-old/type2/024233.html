Subject: time for a new ignition switch?
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

The '74 Campmobile has been giving me a bit of trouble lately as the battery 
has going dead overnight.

I used the portable jump starter to get her going and something strange 
happened.  The starter motor began to turn when I hooked up the cables.  The 
key was in the ignition, but in the off position.

Time for a new switch?
