&gt; I am trying to get the 1700 engine in this old 72 deluxe fired up, so far no luck. Here's what I have checked:
&gt; 
&gt; Spark-Yes at coil and at plugs

how is the timing? Just to make sure, you need to roll the engine over
to TDC. Pull the valve cover to verify it actually is TDC on #1. Both
valves should be closed. Actually while I'm thinking about it, have
you checked all the valve clearances? Anyway, with the engine at TDC
on #1 pull the distributor cap. The it should point roughly toward the
back (I believe it's 12 degrees turned toward the passenger side).
Also look to see if the mark on the distributor body is near this as
well. It's far from optimum, but at least with timing verified at TDC
it should start.

&gt; 
&gt; Fuel-Yes poured some in carb and even put a drop or 2 in the spark plug hole, fule pump IS pumping.

If the timing checks out, does it try to start w/ the throttle open?
If so it might allude to a clogged idle circuit.

&gt; Power to: Idle cutoff solenoids, choke, all confirmed.
&gt; 
&gt; Engine cranks over but will not fire.
&gt; 
&gt; Compression checked out at #1=80, #2=70, #3=60, #4=70, Yes they are
&gt; low, but it should still be able to start, right??

I believe so. I have had run in the 80's all around
