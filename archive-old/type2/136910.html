&gt;Since I got my rebuilt engine running back in September, I have been dealing 
&gt;with a hard-start situation when the engine is cold.  It used to crank for 8 
&gt;pulses and fire; now it cranks for 8 pulses and *almost* fires.  After that, 
&gt;it takes 3 or 4 tries (8-10 pulses each) before it sluggishly comes to life. 

It's 30F in the morning where I am and the FI never ceases to amaze me in it's ability to start instantly, no cranking. It takes a moment to come up to a nice idle but I attribute that to the cold. Unless it's far colder than where I am, the 8 crank and fire is a sign of a weakness in the system already.

When was the last time you put your battery on a charger?

&gt;I usually start it with the parking brake on, clutch in, and no feet on 
&gt;either brake or throttle.  Sometimes I flutter the throttle to help it 
&gt;start, but that seems an intermittent fix at best.  When the engine is warm, 
&gt;it fires right up and idles fine, if a bit high (1000 vs. 850).

That's the aux air regulator job to help the engine idle when cold.

&gt;Is there something I'm missing?  Is there something else I should test for?  
&gt;Is there something else I should replace?

What condition are your spark plugs and rotor in? I would also do a compression test with those new heads of yours.

I know it's winter but did you install at CHT gauge yet?
