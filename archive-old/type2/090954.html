I like mine too.  If you are converting from a 38A bus generator make sure
that you get the correct bug fan hub.  The bus hub has the wrong offset
for the fan when using the alternator tin.  If you can, get real VW
alternator tin and stand too.  The conversion kits use Chinese tin which
is really thin.  You
also need an alternator style fuel pump if you are ever planning on
getting the thing off with the alternator in place!
