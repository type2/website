Subject: RE: Rust - front seat belt mounts

Found the same thing on my 71.  I think this happens when water is trapped
between the wheel well sheet metal and the doubler plate underneath.

I just ground it clean and MIG welded around the hole to seal it up.  I
didn't bother to lay in a patch.

Anyone else found rust when they pulled up the pedestal mats for the seat
belt mounts closest to the door in the late model Bays?

Mine has two little rusty pimples about the diameter of a quarter.

Going to grind them down and spot weld a new piece of metal in I think.

Any other solutions out there?
Ciao!
