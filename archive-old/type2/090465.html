Subject: Bus ran great during the Parade

Just wanted to let everyone know that my Bus ran great during the
parade yesterday.  I was concerned about it overheating but as to most
of the advice from the list it ran cooler then going down the road at
60mph.  I didn't have to use my clutch too much so that also did not
suffer.  It was about 95 degrees.  If you'd like to see a picture of
my bus with the float go to:  http://www.iusb_dot_edu/~kahlgrim/p18.jpg 
to see what rode on top of my Bus go to:

Thanks,
Kevin
