Your local lumber yard or fix-it-up supplier should
carry door skins. Very thin wood sheeting that comes in a
roll. Fill in any divits in your door surface with
Plasti-wood filler. Sand smooth. With the door laying on
your garage floor (kitchen table?) Apply your contact
cement and then the door skin material. Cut it a bit
oversize. Stack some weight on the door skin all around so
it remains flat. let the glue set. Use an exacto knife or
something as sharp to trim the door skin material to the
edge of the cabinet door. lightly sand for effect. finish
with spar varnish while still laying flat. Spar varnish
goes on better on large flat surfaces while laying flat
IMHO. Useing the thin door skin sheet you really arent
adding much thickness so you can just apply it over the old
laminate material. If the old material is bubbled in
spots... remove those areas
and fill with plasti-wood filler. Oh yeah, dont save on
your brush. Get a decent one or you will be picking &quot;hairs&quot;
out of your finish as you go.
 

anyone got a good solution on how to re-laminating your 
westfalia 
cabinets, what to use, and where to get it. my cabinets 
doors are in 
really bad shape and would love to re-laminate them.
