&gt;       As will any oil. Synoil doesn't &quot;find&quot; leaks that dino-oil can't,
it's
&gt;just a bit on the expensive side if you're going to pour it on the ground.


Unfortunately not at all true.  Synthetic oil WILL find the leaks, and
stopping its use will stop the leaks.  I didn't believe it either, until I'd
seen it, on multiple occasions, with many anal owners, I've personaly tried
to nail all of the leaks down on one occurence to no avail and with much
frustration.  16V VW's are particularly cursed, already bad leaking into the
dizzies, a synthetic can compound matters.  Better additive packages, more
detergents, slipperier?  I don't know, but it happens.  And of course it is
expensive, I ran Mobil 1 exclusively in my Corrado, don't have any idea how
if at all it would have affected it's long term life as I bailed paranoid
when the blower and motor hit about 75k, it leaked more than most, less than
others.  I have friends that have put 250k+ on VW inlines running
syntheticsl, and others who have put the same mileage on any ole dino oil,
even accursed 10W40 Quaker Sh*t.  As always take it FWIW, which isn't much.
And of course it is money wasted in a T1 without a sand seal, and although
I'm mulling it over right now for the T4 I'm completing, I have to admit I'm
unlikely to ever think I can get the pushrods sealed perfectly enough.
Looks like the Castrol HD in straight 30 and straight 40 for me.
