Subject: Re: Valve Adjusment Made Easy

Terry, am slamed too.......... but believe be, now that i put back the 
distributor gear 180 deg back.....where it should be, all valves are at 
006... and perfect

Quick answer, before i change the gear:
when on TDC #1, if the intake and exhaust valve where at 006, the 
exhaust #2 was at  1/8 loose???? and the intake #2 was tight......so i 
checked on another perfectly running engine and when on TDC #1, the 
intake #2 is also at 006 and the exhaust #2 is tight, same on my 
bus......... so i took a split core that am working on and i put back 
the crank and cam, and i started turning both engine at the same 
time.........looking in the lifter hole of the #1 problem engine..... 
yeap, that cam was 180 off.......so i adjusted the valves with the rotor 
pointing at #3, everything was perfect!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This bus was running like that before!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

&gt;The pushrod's would always be on the wrong side of the lobe--how coud it
&gt;run??
&gt;
&gt;This sounds way too insane---
&gt;
&gt;I was going to also add , after I had been thinking about this--
&gt;
&gt;The pushrods come in two lengths--the solid lifter rods and the hydralic
&gt;push rods are different--maybe somebody mixed and matched them--
&gt;
&gt;But Oh--No---Now  you slam me with this impossibility--:&gt;)
