Subject: Re: [T2] need rear defogger advice


&gt;I tested the resistance on the rear window defogger grid and get nothing.

Continuity - you mean?

&gt;All traces appear to be in great shape.
&gt;I can get continuity down each side from the clip on each side, and then
&gt;about 1/3 of the way down each cross grid.

Tough test to isolate b/c if you test from one end of one strip to the 
other end - you could get a good continuity test that is in fact from there 
all the way around a potential break and then through one of the other strips.

&gt;Never had a chance to test the window before I took it out, but it &quot;looks&quot;
&gt;just fine.  Anyone know how to test this other than continuity?...No ,
&gt;I don't have  really big freezer&lt;grin&gt;.
&gt;
&gt;If it is bad, does anyone know of a good fix?

Yes. There are kits that catalogs like Eastwood (premium prices) and others 
sells.
