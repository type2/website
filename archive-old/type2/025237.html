Hi Ken (et all),
[...]

I still think the $120 is one hell of a deal.  Especially considering the
cost of the 38AMP regulator.  Sounds like you are also a full endorser.

1) As for the fuel pump, yes -- the kit does not include one.  I did not
mention this directly, as I _did_ mention that I going dual carbs and will
be using an electric pump.  ((I'm under the assumption, perhaps incorrect,
that stock fuel pumps won't drive a set of Dual Kadrons?))

2) Tin -- the tin included is the generator / alternator backing plate.
That round piece you used to hold the fan in place.  Typically a $10 part.
Taiwan of course, but I put a new one of these on my gen last time and they
are OK quality.

3) Carb clearance:  I have seen my VW FLAPS carry a part (I think $10) that
basically is a 3 inch riser for the carb.  This gets around the clearance
problems.  Of course, your air cleaner may be a problem now :)  I've also
believe another listee said the new Bocar 30/31-PICT doesn't have clearance
problems, but I have not confirmed this myself.

I've had one (older style) Alternator where there is a section ground out of
the driver side to accommodate a carb.  I'm sure a good VW FLAPS can do this
for you.  I didn't see that in impacted the Alternator in anyway... maybe
your warranty :)

(Tin?) Three other issues: you need a different fuel pump (somebody told me
not long ago he had crammed an early fuel pump in there somehow but the
rest of us use an &quot;alternator&quot; fuel pump.

You need a different fuel pump rod to go with it. They really should supply
or at least tell you this because it's not obvious.

And your carb linkage will now interfere with your alternator body in such
a way that the throttle will stick open (bad thing &lt;tm&gt;). I've heard that
there is such a thing as &quot;alternator linkage&quot; and this makes sense if the
alt was standard on any carbureted Type Is, but I've never seen it. You can
clearance the alternator case (which is what I do) but it's sort of a pain
in the ass. However the alternative is grim. 8)
