Subject: Re: [T2] POR-15 binstead of underseal

Darren,

Ummm...painted a whole Karman Ghia roof 4 years ago with por-15 after 
sandblasting it.  

Sat outside for the last 4 years...no rust anywhere.....I probably didn't 
follow instructions very well...wonder what the difference is?


There is green mold on it, but not any rust anywhere....oh, and I does 
look just like they said it would if left in the sun...kinda dull looking.

Pics if anyone is *really* interested....I am at a loss to explain why it 
works well for some people and terrible for other folks....seems weird!


Cheers, dave

&amp;gt; &amp;gt;Rust Bullet works great for me.

&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; I did a test on a section of my roof with POR-15.
&amp;gt; Followed the instructions to the letter. It's not
&amp;gt; holding up. Not to mention too many steps. The
&amp;gt; section on my roof that I used RustBullet has held
&amp;gt; strong. No signs of rust reappearing.  I also painted
&amp;gt; my heater tubes outboard of the engine, they still look
&amp;gt; good too.
