Subject: Re: [T2] 2 dizzies available.

&gt; * 0231170093 / 0229052055
&gt; * 0231168005 / 021905205-p
&gt;   Both are complete with the vacuum puck. They wont
&gt; work
&gt; on my 74 (I dont think) as they only have a single vac
&gt; port. p-mail me if you are interested.


If that is 205S it is the original dizzy for a 74. Both with carbs and
Auto w/ FI.

The 205P was originally on a 60s bug but is also listed as suitable for
the 74 bus among others.
