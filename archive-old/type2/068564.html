Subject: logo of the type2 mailing list

&gt;Can I talk to you about doing an official list logo for us?

Ken Hooper ask me if I want to do an official logo for the list?

If somebody think it's a good idea, I can. I can make a couple of logo, 
put them on a www page, and everybody can give comments.

Just as you want!

Give me your comments!


Bye
