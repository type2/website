Just a reminder that the VW Super Jam at Maple Grove Raceway is tomorrow, in
Pa.  This is near the Morgantown exit of the Pa. turnpike, about an hour
&gt;from Philly.  Directions are at http://www.maplegroveraceway_dot_com . It's a
large show and well worth the trip for you East Coast folks.  Huge swap meet
area as well.  Hopefully I'll see some of you there.  (Look for the yellow
Bus Depot sign.)
