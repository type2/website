Subject: RE: [T2] Re-tired

I agree with nemo's praise on the Cooper SRM II's.  A couple of summers
ago I replaced the shocks on my westy (KGY's?) and felt a huge
difference in stability.  A few months later when I had the $ for tires
I completed the partial update in technology for ride performance.  The
bus definitely rides stiffer; however, the ride of a vehicle is a matter
of preference.
