I would never powdercoat a wheel... because it WILL chip and once it does
the wheel is pretty much useless as far as looking good goes.

I have 2 wheels for my 61 bus on which the powdercoating has been chipped
to smithereens.  I have talked to a couple of bodymen and none can come up
with any way to get it off so that i can refinish the wheel. (if anyone
has any suggestions i'm all ears!)

This isnt a problem i guess with late bus wheels being as plentiful as
they are, but if they ever do become harder to find, you or someone who
gets a hold of that wheel and wants to fix it will be frustrated.

take care,
