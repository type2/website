Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Samba Effect /RANT/

a wise man once said:
&quot;a thing is worth what someone
is willing to pay you for it.&quot;

of course these folks who are asking outrageous prices
for rustbuckets really have no idea of the fair market
price for a bus.

but if there is really some idiot out there who has
alot of money burning a hole in his pocket &amp; is
willing to pay top dollar for a non-running, no
title, rust bucket p.o.s. then hey whatever.

the _real_ bus owners (i.e. people on this list) know
what to look for &amp; are generally not concerned with
&quot;looking cool driving around town&quot;.

i just ended (i think) a several month long search for
a bus. of course it needs a few things but while searching
i tried very hard to steer clear of the folks who were asking
waaaaaaaay too much for whatever they thought they had.

the bottom line is know what questions to ask, know what to
look for. &amp; by all means if the deal doesn't feel right just
walk away. there will be other busses.
