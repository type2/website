&gt;Your points are good ones, George. What you're doing works for your engine (and peace of mind) and that's what matters. But, if we agree that you shouldn't drop a bolt into your engine, then neither of us should need the oil strainer. There is, I admit, always a chance of a piece of metal getting pulled up into the pump but let's face it, if that happens you've already got some problems. If it fits through the pump, the filter will catch it, if not, new oil pump. But then you'd probably be taking the case apart anyway to find out where that honking chunk of steel/aluminum/babbit metal came from, right?

It doesn't take a very large piece of metal to jam an oil pump.  I imagine something as big as a pinhead would do it.  And how many of us, if our oil pump dies resulting in a loss of pressure, would be able to shut the engine down before it was completely ruined?  Small bits of metal in the crankcase are not that uncommon believe it or not.  Can someone remind me again what the DIS-advantages of having an oil screen are?

Thanks,
