&gt; And when you actually get the tools.. the packaging will say &quot;Chicago 
&gt; Electric&quot; or whatever, but the tool itself will have some generic lable on it, and 
&gt; say.. made in China.

   Well, it's not just Harbor Freight, BTW...There's a &quot;boutique&quot; auto 
accessories
store and catalog in England, that makes a point of claiming that each of its
products is the &quot;best, finest, smoothest, slickest, etc.&quot; in each 
category...What
someone finally figured is that the boutique isn't above taking off the shelf 

products and repackaging them under the boutique name...and pricing... ;-(
