Subject: west coast metric seat covers

I bought seat covers and pads from WCM and decided to
start this
little adventure yesterday as it was pretty warm here.
Has anyone out there bought and installed these
succesfully? I would sure like to know the secret!
I have the passenger seat kind of on but the cover
just doesnt
seem to fit! to small?

TIA
Dan
