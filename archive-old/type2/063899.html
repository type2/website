&gt; ack-   my faith is once again being battered.

there, there, clara, it'll get better . . . and there *is* good
news.  I have confirmed that the screw in question is actually an
M4x.75 thread, bought a tap, and will have that ventilation cover
back in place today.

&gt; the -Parts List-missing a part, even if it is just a lowly screw!

&quot;lowly&quot;?  Didn't someone say &quot;For want of a screw, ventilation
was lost.  For want of ventilation, conciousness was lost.
For want of consciousness, control was lost.  For want
of control, the bus was lost.&quot;  Wait a minute! *I* said that.
And anyway, millions of people search tirelessly for a screw,
even a lowly screw.

&gt; How sad!
&gt; How true!  I feel betrayed!  How could they do this?
&gt; &lt;sob&gt;
&gt;   We're not worthy

Yes, it's sad, but we *are* worthy.  It's the printers!  They did
it!  Some guy with carbon black printer's ink all over him thought
&quot;who'll miss this screw&quot; and just never thought about us 30 years
later.  It's ok tho.  He probably got cancer from the carbon and
died a slow agonizing death (unlike the person who lost control
of the bus and wrapped it around a Lexus).

The &lt;sob&gt;s are OK, but keep them dry.  Those salt-water tears
will eat your bus!
