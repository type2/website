&gt; Im sure many of you have done some cross-country trips in your busses.  Any
&gt; route suggestions (Mass to Cali)?  And how long did your trip take?  Is 15
&gt; days too little time?  THANKS!

hmmmm,  almost any way to the Miss river is good, route I-70 is LOoooooong
across Kansas.  and route 550 between Durango and Oruy killed my 65 bus.

enjoy
