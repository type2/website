Subject: In search of Steal your face sticker with VW roundel..Fri.
  question...

I am looking for a Grateful Dead 'Steal your Face' sticker with the vw 
emblem in the middle (this is the skull with a circular picture in the top, 
for those Grateful Dead inept) Usually the skull was black on a clear 
background sticker, and the vw emblem was red..

Apparently, they stopped making them. If any one knows of a place that has 
them for sale, or if anyone has one stashed in a drawer with their old 
tie-dyed tapestries, could you let me know?

Thanks,

Fred
