Subject: Re: CB antenna on a westy roof-G. Lyle note!

re CB antenna- I remember reading somewhere that you need a GROUND PLANE
for a typical CB antenna to work optimally, and for fiberglasss roofs,
you can get antennas with their own tuned ground (the antenna is part of
the lead in wire to the radio, and cannot be shortened).  Magnetic mount
antennas really don't offer a ground plane (all that paint, like
glass-mounted antennas interfere) but have their own ground as
mentioned.  If you buy a GP antenna, even a gutter mount should work
without cutting a hole in the roof.  I think George Lyle can answer this
better......
