Actually, there are 11 michelin factories in France!

Bought a set of Michelins a few years ago.  All the same size, same model,
but they were made in Canada, Spain, The US, and Taiwan!

On the subject of &quot;American Made&quot;, there is a lot to America that most US
folks don't recognize.  America extends from Tierra del Fuego to the
Arctic ocean.  Even &quot;US made&quot; can be twisted, as there are sweatshop
factories on US protectorate islands in the Pacific, where laborers are
imported from the far East and normal US minimum wage laws don't apply,
yet the goods can be labeled &quot;made in USA&quot;.
