Based on your list,  (sorry, I didn't see orig qu) I'd include a piece of
plywood about 8' squ to put under the bottle jack or stock jack in soft
soil, 2 hunks of 2x4 for blocking wheels, and consider a jackstand to
&quot;insure&quot; your jack.
   A starter, generator are bulky luxuries- I have a spare alternator, but
then I have 233,000 mi on the original!
Might be just as easy to carry a spare battery.  A complete cv'd axle is
also bulky- if you had clean cv;s, they should last over 200K (from
experience- I changed mine at around 230K only because I had the engine out
to do a clutch disk.  I carry one spare CV joint.  I also carry a 3/4 drive
sliding handle for (1) changing tires with a 19mm impact socket (2) removing
rear drum if bearing fails (3)for removing stubborn nuts on shocks, etc
(4)defense.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Concerning my recent post, &quot;upcoming trip&quot;...what tools should I have,
and
&gt; &gt; what maintenance checks should I perform along the way?
&gt; &gt; Thanks,
&gt; &gt; Richard
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; ***Tool Box &amp; Supplies
&gt; Road repair Tool Box
&gt; Dwell Meter &amp; Timing Light
&gt; Oil &amp; Lucas oil treatment
&gt; Bailing Wire &amp; Wire Ties
&gt; Fuses, Electrical Wire
&gt; Crimp on Electrical Connectors
&gt; Duct Tape, Electical Tape
&gt; Safety Glasses, Hand Cleaner
&gt; Penetrating Oil (Kroil)
&gt; Piece of Cardboard (to lay on)
&gt; Bottle or Small Floor Jack
&gt; 4 Way Lug Wrench
&gt; Axle Nut Knock Off Tool (bus)
&gt; Fire Extinguisher
&gt; Carbon Monoxide Alarm
&gt;
&gt; ***Extra Vehicle Parts
&gt; Alternator, Alternator Belt
&gt; Generator, Starter
&gt; Voltage Regulator
&gt; Fuel Pump &amp; Fuel Filter
&gt; Spark Plugs, Cap, Rotor
&gt; Points and Condenser
&gt; Ignition Coil
&gt; Clutch Cable, Throttle Cable
&gt; Valve Cover Gaskets
&gt; Complete axle w/CV joints ready to go.
&gt;
&gt; ***Preventive Maintenance
&gt; Alternator Belt
&gt; Check, Replace if needed, All Lights
&gt; Check/Change Oil in transaxle
&gt; Change Oil in Engine, add Lucas!!
&gt; Grease Front Wheel Bearings
&gt; Check, Bleed, Replace if needed: brakes.
&gt; Grease Entire Front end and steering box.
&gt; Tune up engine, new plug wires?
&gt; Adjust Valves
&gt; Check engine and rear engine door seal.
&gt; Check Tires for Wear &amp; Pressure
&gt;
&gt; Along the way, if you have done the above before you leave, oil change,
&gt; valve adjustment and check dwell (no need to check timing, it only changes
&gt; if the dwell has moved, when you reset the dwell, the timing will be back
to
&gt; where it is supposed to be) will be all you need to do.
&gt;
&gt; On oil changes, keep to 2,000 miles on unfiltered and 3,000 miles on
&gt; filtered engines.  If you have hydraulic lifters and a Compufire ignition,
&gt; only oil changes are needed on your trip.
