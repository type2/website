Hi guys,

&gt;     I have a 72 westy with the original seats I
&gt; rebuilt with pads and covers from sew fine. Look
&gt; great but a bit tough after long drives. I'm looking
&gt; for ideas to replace them with a more user friendly
&gt; seat, more comfortable. Does anybody have experience
&gt; with seats that will work here?

David has a point.
The front seats in my 77 Microbus(a bench &amp; a drivers
bucket) have had it in a BIG way &amp; only a blanket &amp; an
EXTREMELY thin seat cover are saving my wife and I
from a trip to the proctologists :-(
Is there any way to re-pad the seats when I have them
re-trimmed so that they'll be a bit more like modern
seat?
I had Recaro's(sports seats) in my last camper &amp; they
were without rival &amp; was wondering if there is a way
to modify the padding so both bucket &amp; the bench are
more comfortable.
:-)
