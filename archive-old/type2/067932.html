&gt; I haven't had too much problems but there are a couple jerks out
&gt;there (who naturally have false return addresses) that I would like 
&gt;to stake over an ant-hill.


And to all of that I say:  Yikes, slow down people.  Boy some of
you are edgy!

I got email from this guy in response to my post to
rec.autos.makers.vw.aircooled about a Westy interior I have for sale.
He's trying to flush out a 66 Westy he just purchased.

*I* told him about the type2 list, and gave him instructions how to
get help from the Majordomo server.  Apparently he's not too net-savvy
yet, 'cause he obviously flubbed it.  I'll help him out, you all go
take a Valium or something...  ;-)

Ciao, 
Rodney
