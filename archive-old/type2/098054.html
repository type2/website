Subject: timing pict34 and new points pitted

Hello all,
 
  First hope to see some of you in Puyallup WA 
 
this weekend. Look for me I'll be there. Sorry, finally
 
borrowed a timing light and Ill be damned but my 
 
static timing just wasn't even close. Timed to notch 
 
and pinging like crazy. So I turned the distributor
 
counter clockwise a bit and sounded better. Didn't 
 
idle as nice but I think that I'm battling a vacuum 
 
leak in the booster. Thats another story!!! My question 
 
is my new points are starting to pit and have only
 
 about 50 miles on them!!! And I was looking at them 
 
when I turned the motor over and I don't have contact
 
with the phenolic block all the way around. Is this normal?
 
I doesn't seem to me that the block only hits on the lobes, 
 
but my dwell is at 25 on the 8 cyl scale. I guess I should just 
 
suck it up and by the electronic points huh?
 
Anyways thanks for listening to me vent my points and 
 
timing troubles.
 
Thanks,
 
Paul Saulsbury
