Subject: Make Your Own Bumper Stickers at Kinkos

&gt;
&gt;I want a bumper sticker (when I get bumpers:-) that says &quot;I Brake for Tailgaters&quot;
&gt;in very legible, plain bold letters.  Does anybody have the resources to make
&gt;bumperstickers?  What would it cost to do that?

Go to Kinkos  ( chain of copy stores ) with what you would like to turn
into a sticker.  Give it to them with a few dollars and they'll give
you a bumper sticker.

take care,
        brandy
