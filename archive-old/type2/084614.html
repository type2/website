&gt;
&gt;Good day. If anyone is interested i will have a 3 - speed auto tranny from 
&gt;a 77 westfalia available sometimes soon...I'll be swapping in a 4speed 
&gt;manual into my van so that's why i don't need it. Its in great shape and 
&gt;has never caused me any problems. I have no clue what its worth... Offers?
&gt;
&gt;I'm located in ALberta Canada. Shipping may not be too bad. I just 
&gt;received a 410lbs complete engine shipped from Vancouver to Saskatoon, Sk 
&gt;for ~$150cdn tax included!
&gt;
&gt;Chris.
