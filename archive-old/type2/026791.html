Buenos something or other....

That black mat stuff that sticks to the side of the front seats is pealing 
off all over the place now, and there is this nasty glue stuff VW used to 
hold it there. I would like to replace it, but im guessing I will need to 
first get something to wipe this stuff off with.

So, what gets 26 year old back gunky glue off of paint, without stripping 
the paint in the process?

I tried a few caustic things around the house, but nothing seems to do the 
trick thus far...
