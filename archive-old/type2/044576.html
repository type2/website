Subject: [T2] Can't find reverse when type II is hot

Hi.

When my 76 Westfalia is cold, I can find reverse no problem, but when
it's been running more than 30 minutes, it gets pretty near impossible
to find the reverse. I also noticed this weekend while camping overnight
with the front higher than the back, that this also interferes with
finding the reverse. This suggests an oil level problem or something.

The Muir manual I have states that if you have any problems with any of
the gears, your transmission's probably shot and, since the job is so
specialized and expensive, you might want to consider selling the car.

No, no, no, no, NO! 

Please someone tell me I can change the gear oil or something and that
my transmission is not dead yet.

Thanks, Nicholas.
