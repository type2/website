Subject: RE: Engine dies   :)      Weber Progressive carb now

Hey Rob,

The fuel spray you are seeing is from the accelerator pump.  This spring
loaded diaphragm pushes a stream of fuel out of the top (emmulsion?)tube
when the accelerator is pushed in.  This spray should be even and strong
(not a dribble).

The vacuum from the running engine pulls the rest of the fuel charge when
running. So it is difficult to tell what other thing might or might not be
clogged.

Eric Bradway just rebuilt one of these about a month ago... Eric are you out
there?  He may be in Vermont on a journey now because I have not heard from
him lately...  Anyway Eric is good technically and would be helpful here.

...  From my experiences if you have a good accelerator pump stream it will
run... To some degree at least, to make it to FMIJ :)  Granted idle sucks.


Good Luck,

Subject: Engine dies :) Weber carb now



I removed my single weber carb and cleaned it up. I blew it out and looked
it over. The floats seem to work and there is a pointy needle that stops the
gas flow. That works. I cleaned the gas screen on the carb.

Holding the carb in my hand, I attached the fuel line to the carb and the
fuel pump (temporary electric) comes on I can see the gas bubbling through
the filter. I now realize that the chamber fills with gas. It does I am
sure. When I open the throttle all the way gas sprays out of the bottom of
the carb in a burst, but thats all unless I close the throttle and open it
again. Should the gas keep coming out if I leave the throttle held open? Or
am I lacking vacum from the engine or something? To a person who doesn't
know it seems the gas should keep flowing out. I'd like to know before I
tear it down further or bolt it back on for a test so thanks for any
insight!!

If it is supposed to keep flowing there must be something else clogged I
didn't notice.

(spark and fuel all the way to the carb has been established..thanks)
