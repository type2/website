Subject: RE: [T2] Dirty fuel filter = loss of power?

I have a spreadsheet at work that someone posted here with all the service
intervals.

I'm going to fill in the box for my filter change and I'll post then if nobody
does before then.

I do have a backup tank on the shelf...

&gt; Hey - how often do you have to change them out? Late last year I bit the
&gt; bullet and &quot;restored&quot; my gas take with that handy Por 15 kit and I think
they
&gt; job was worth it. It helps to have a 2nd take to fix up so you can just
swap
&gt; out next time the engine is out.
