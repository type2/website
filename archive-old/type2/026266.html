Subject: Idle problem when cold (2 litre / dual Solex)

Hi fellow type 2'ers,

When I start my engine (stock everything, dual Solexes) from stone cold,
it runs OK but has a habit of cutting out at the first couple of
junctions when I let off the gas.  I've checked the chokes and they seem
OK (closed when cold, gradually opening up later).  The timing and
mixture should be OK.  I even adjusted the dashpot correctly.  The idle
speed is right when warmed up but is the same when cold.  I would have
expected it to run a little faster when I first start up.
Any ideas what the problem might be?  Probably obvious to you old hands.
(Answers like &quot;Ditch the carbs and slap on a Weber progressive&quot; or &quot;Get
the FI system from a junker&quot; will be treated with the contempt that they
deserve.)
Is there any special starting technique that I should know about?  All I
do at present is prime the carbs with one pump of the pedal first, then
turn the key.
