Where??  Why, right behind the passenger's seat . . . or is it the driver's 
seat . . .  No!!  It's back in the main compartment . .   somewhere under . 
. .  behind??

But I do have the location written on the third page of the owners manual . 
. or is it the sixth page of the maintenance manual . .

Wait, let me check Muir and Bentley and/or Haynes!!!  And I'll take the best 
two out of three.
