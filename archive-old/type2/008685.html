&gt;Now, if I read my Bentley right, which is always at least open to
&gt;discussion, it sounds as if the tranny will have to come out, then the
&gt;rear half of the shift rod, before the flexible coupler can be replaced on
&gt;the shift rod.  Is that right?  [If so, I'm a little in awe of David B.

Bill,

The coupler can be replaced with the transmission installed.  You create
clearance by positioning the shifter lever in 1st or 3rd gear (which moves
the shaft in the nose cone (aka hockey stick) rearward), and by moving the
shift rod (after disconnected from the coupler) forward in its tube.  It's a
bit of a puzzle, but no Rubik's cube :).  In the worse case scenario [and I
do detest those] you'd find the coupler rust-welded to the hockey stick
shaft.  Then you might need to pull the old standbys out of your tool box
(like penetrating oil, Dremel, prayer, or pentacle rituals).  Even in the
worst case it is highly probable that you'll successfully remove the coupler
without any need relinquish your soul.

:) Ron
