Hi all,

My daughter is giving a speech in her 6th grade class on Wednesday. Her
topic, chosen by her, is the VW Westfalia camper conversions. While well
versed on the Vanagon era 1980-1992. She needs info on the begining
1949?-1967 (splitty) 1968-1979 (baywindow) and the euro van 1993.

Any and all help would be greatly appreciated. She needs the history along
with pics and floor plans.

We have been using http://www.dogpile_dot_com but not finding the info needed
with exception to the vanagon and the new euro van.

BTW the great type2 pumpkin was/is a BIG hit in my household.


TIA
Bill  V.                 &quot;I'd Rather Be Hiking The
'82 CA Westy [FreeBird]       Greater Yellowstone&quot;
