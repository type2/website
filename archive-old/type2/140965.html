Subject: Finally available- locking gas caps for early bay buses

I just won one on the unmentionable auction site for $52. They are Chinese 
repops of the gas cap from the Thing Kubelwagen type vehicles. They also fit 
68-72 VW buses. They look like stainless.
With the price of gas being what it is, seems like a good idea to me, I've 
been looking for one for years.

They are sold by The Thing Shop_at_ $105   ( 
http://thethingshop_dot_com/detail.asp?PRODUCT_ID=211201551A     )  if you just 
want to buy one, or try the unmentionable auction site, and type in: 
Locking Gas Cap for VW Bus

Good luck!
