Andy,

Thanks for the helpful tips!

&gt;You mentioned that you replaced the metal and rubber brake lines. Was this
&gt;because of internal damage (rust)? Reason I ask is because most calipers start

Last year I replaced the lines only because the rubber fronts were original
(and I'm into preventative maintainence) and the metal lines had a lot of
surface rust on them.  When I originally revived the bus about 5 years ago
(it had been sleeping in someone's back yard for 12 years) I replaced the
rear wheel cylinders/shoes/hardware and replaced one of the front calipers
that had siezed with a rebuilt (I'll have to check my records on which one
it was, this is an important point).  The brake fluid resevoir was not dried
out, but the mastercylinder had leaked enough into the powerbooster to kill
the diaphram.

Well, enough theory, I'll have to get dirty and find out what's going on here!
