It's quite easy............once you remove the cabinet.
Unfortunately, as per The Bentley, you must first remove the icebox cabinet,
the storage shelf, the rear facing seat, and the rear bench seat (bed).
Guess why the PO didn't replace that curtain?

Sorry, no shortcut on this one.

Maybe painting the outside of the window with Jerry Bears, star swirls, or 
whatever
blends into the motif of your bus, would be the easiest solution to your 
problem.

Me, I pulled out all of that stuff anyway, to deal with a little rust 
beginning on the floor,
and to put noise deadening panels in--so I just replaced the curtains with 
ones that
match the others I put in.
