Subject: Oil leakage - push rod tubes

1977 Westy, with a bit of a Frankenstein engine...most likely a 1600 
converted to FI...why...who knows, but it was done professionally.  The 
problem is thus:  recent valve adjustment has not fixed minor misfiring 
and backfires - now suffering loss of power and not firing on all 
cylinders.  Previously troublesome #3 is all good now...so it is not 
the culprit.  Three weeks off the road, and there is not yet 
significant, but still troublesome oil leakage from around the push-rod 
tubes...such that it drips onto and then off of the tin cover plates 
underneath.  Leakage is from outside ends of push rods both left and 
right.  Is this part of my problem maybe....?
