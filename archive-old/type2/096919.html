Be sure to set the timing using a stroboscopic timing light instead of =
statically, as Muir suggests. If your bus has the stock =
vacuum/centrifugal advance distributor, timing should be set at 7.5 =
degrees BTDC _at_ 900 RPM. This should also work out to be around 40-42 =
degrees BTDC _at_ 3500+ RPM (full advance).  If the bus has a distributor =
that is other than stock, it should be set at full advance. The timing =
cannot be set accurately using Muir's suggested static timing method, =
which is one of the major flaws of his VW book.

This Spring I bought my 78 Westy from a co-worker who had been not=20
using it for over a year.   I need to get this bus &quot;smogged&quot; under a=20
California Law, (it had been before until last year).   Can any list=20
members assist me in getting this engine ready for &quot;smogging&quot; and=20
helping me set it back afterwards or direct me to someone who cqan do=20
this wiithout costing me a month's pay?

All help appreciated!  I've learned so much about my Bus on this list!

BEN

PS, I do have Muir Book and tune up tools coming this week.&gt;&gt;
