&gt; There is still resistance in the spark plug boots..about 1k ohm I suspect.

&gt; Zero ohms is good as far as I am concerned.


I meant to reply to this before,, whenever I hear ZERO ohms,, I like to double
check that is not the infinite end of the scale..

Too often when there is an open ,, the meter reads infinite but the persons
states that as ZERO ohms rather than open

As there should be a few to 1k ohms,, I would be inclined to double check...
infinite  means no spark getting to the plug,, zero means no problems...
