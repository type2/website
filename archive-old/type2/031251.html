&gt; A couple of questions though: The trusty Bentley has the following as
&gt; step 4 of engine removal:
&gt; 
&gt; On cars with fuel injection, disconnect the injection system wiring
&gt; harness from the coil, the injectors, the intake air distributor, the
&gt; crankcase, the tempature sensors, and the intake air distributor and its
&gt; related parts.

there is a wire on the coil that needs to be removed, but the coil also
has to be removed to take the engine out (quirk)

the injector wires themselfs do not have to be removed, BUT there are two
plugs on the firewall that do have to be removed, one is the injector
resistors.

there is a plug on the back side of the AFM (air flow meter) also need to
remove the entire intake system above the air distributor but not it 

take the wire apart on the temp sensor, there is an inline plug.

also there is a wire on the voltage regulator that goes through the fire
wall.

don't forget there are TWO fuel lines, one on either side of the engine

&gt; Do I need to remove the intake air distributor to pull the engine - it
&gt; seems as though I do not???

no
&gt; 
&gt; The upper engine to trany mounting bolts - are these 15mm??
&gt;  I am used to the 1600 dual port of a 71 where all four bolts were 17mm

I think 3 are 17 and one is 15 but not sure

&gt; The pressure regulator and fuel line through the fire wall - the Bentley
&gt; says right front - it looks to me to be left front or maybe I am not
&gt; remembering what is right and left -- from facing the back or facing the front??

the presure regulator is on the right firewall (front is front) but the
fuel line &quot;in&quot; is on the left side. the regulator is on the &quot;out&quot; side

&gt; Finally, what have people out there used to support the trany?? Can you
&gt; use a floor jack and a 2X12?

tranny should have a yoke that holds it up and doesn't need any support,
make sure both bolts are in the yoke, they are a PITA to get in and out
and often folks do not put one or both in.

Good luck
Bob
