&gt;I've been planning a 3 month trip to Mexico and I'm worried about the stock
&gt;propane tank under my 79 Westy.  There is only about 8 inches of clearance

Ray, My '72 Westy and I have already logged more than a thousand miles of
Mexican driving already this year, and tens of thousands overall.  I do not
know what horror stories you have been told, but the truth is the major
highways in Mexico are on par with US highways.  As for the &quot;topes,&quot; the
ones on mall parking lots here in the states are far more fearsome than any
I have ever seen south of the border.

Please feel free to email me off the list if you need first-hand
information from someone who has been there.
