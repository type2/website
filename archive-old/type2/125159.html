Subject: RE: [T2] N part numbering

&gt; i don't understand how the N type part numbers work

&gt; If I may guess rather blindly, I'll say it's generic stuff: 
&gt; parts that are not particular to Volkswagens, but still need 
&gt; some part number so that they can be ordered and handled by 
&gt; Volkswagen dealers.


You are correct.
