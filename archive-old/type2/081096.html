Subject: propane tank

I picked up a nice original propane tank over the weekend. I am not sure how
to install it though. Can someone tell me how these tanks were attached
under their bus?

I don't want to use it for anything inside the bus like a stove, etc, Its
going to be used just for external use when camping.

Thanks!
