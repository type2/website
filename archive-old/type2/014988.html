I quietly left the list a few weeks ago. I needed some time without the
e-mail volume. I've not totally recovered from that need, so please bear
with me if I'm kind of quiet most of the time.

Those of you who know me may also recognize that I've changed e-mail
address.  My other addresses are still valid, but I plan to use this one
for list traffic.

Anyway, I finally (today) fixed my honker exhaust leak. What a comedy of
errors! First, I had an 1800 head with holes drilled in it for air
injection (hey, I didn't know that's what they were; I thought they were
for temp senders); I replaced that with an SIR rebuilt head...not the best
quality, but at least it didn't have holes in it. Then I had problems
getting the heat exchanger to mate up with the head...and even when it did,
there seemed to be a leak. Then, pulling off my muffler to remove my HE for
the 17th time, I broke 3 of 4 studs off. It was the stock muffler, which
meant I had to try to extract the studs; that never worked right and I
ended up drilling them out and trying to weld new studs in. Ken can tell
you I am one sorry welder...it just didn't take. So today I went and bought
a used HE from a dude who charges too much but usually has what I need;
then I bought the extractor exhaust from my FLAPS.

Finally, no exhaust leaks!! Of course, the old greasy HE smokes like a
cigar, but that'll pass with a little time and a few miles. We'll have to
see if I can even get heat out of these HE's this winter. It all depends on
how much crap I can burn off, I guess. ;)

Anyway, it's good to be driving a bus that doesn't sound like a Mack truck.
Now I just need to score a brake booster and fix that.

Take care! Joe ('72 bus, 'Fyn' w/custom 2.0 liter FI/hyd overported
