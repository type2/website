meant to say &quot;metal cutting threads&quot; instead of &quot;thread cutting screws&quot;  :)

&gt; I got an idea.. don't know if it's the best,, but try screwing a bolt in
&gt; there with thread cutting screws (with larger threads than 3.5mm).. maybe
&gt; even put some epoxy in there too to make it hold. let the epoxy dry and then
&gt; drill out the hole and tap it.  Maybe that'll work better.
