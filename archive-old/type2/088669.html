Subject: Valve Adjustments

Hello All,
I am not confident in my ability to adjust my valves correctly.  I attempted
3 times today and still they sound clattery or loose.  My questions,  which
is worse, a tight or loose valve?

After 60 miles, how much damage could I have done?  Assuming they are loose.

When driving, what would I notice with a loose?   and Tight valve?

I am operating a 6,000 mile 1600 Mexican longblock.

Thanx in advance
