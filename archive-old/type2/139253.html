Subject: furnace in VW 

I just bought a propex furnace for my bus. $600 this is the quickest link I
found for product info:
http://www_dot_calormarineshop.co_dot_uk/focus-on/propex-heatsource-1800.htm
high tech british unit.
half the btu's of that suburban unit, but 1/5 the size and very economical
on amperage and propane.  The Suburban SF-30 draws 6.5 amps vs. 1.8 amps for
the Propex HS-1800! I think the propex will be enough to keep my bus comfy.
Don't have it installed and hooked up yet, but SOON!!!

I bought it from Karl Mullandore of MD, he installs them too for a fee,

&gt;I was looking at the Camping World site when I cam across this:
&gt;http://www_dot_campingworld_dot_com/browse/skus/index.cfm?skunum=17372

&gt;It is a low profile fully enclosed propane furnace.  It is only 7.5 inches
&gt;tall and has gas hookups on top or rear.

&gt;My question is, has anybody installed this furnace or something similar in
&gt;their bus?  It would fit in the space below the jumpseat rather nicely.
&gt;It is kind of expensive, but likely cheaper than trying to get a Propex
&gt;and get it shipped over the pond.
