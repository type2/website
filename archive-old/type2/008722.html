I went to Bow Wow today and bought everything I supposedly need for a tune
up. I tried to do it, and got hung up on the second paragraph of the Idiot's
guide, which isn't great for my self esteem. I am so frusterated. If there's
anyone who would be willing to help me with this, I would be eternally
grateful.
