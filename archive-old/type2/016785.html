Subject: RE: 71 Dorm - Top Removal

I'm sure you got these suggestion from others, but I just thought I
would add...

Let the air out of the tires. It will probably drop about 3&quot; Roll it in.
Jack it up. fillup the air in the tires in the spring. (pump, pump, sip
beer, pump, pump, sip ...)

How about the garage door.  Can't it come up just a bit more?!?!?  If it
is a power lifted door, the 'stop' could be removed, and you could get a
bit more travel and perhaps some more lift as a result..


Perhaps a radical idea, but why not take the wheels off COMPLETELY???

((What!!))  Well, Harbor Freight has 4-wheeled carrier for each of the
wheel.  it costs some money, but is a great investment.  I think about
$70 for one, or $130 for two.  Take the wheels OFF and let it rest on
the drums/rotors. Four carriers needed, of course.

Or, build your own with their 4&quot; castors at $7 each (255 lbs)  One wheel
would be $28, and hold over 1,000 lbs.  Full set would be just over
$110.  Probably find these wheels/castors locally, everywhere.

OK, I still don't give up.

How about getting four steel wheels sans rubber. No tires, just wheels.
Junk yard wheels.  If you have enough clearance, you should be able to
roll it in and out on the bare steel wheels at minimal cost and effort.

(See, I saved the best for last.  But only IF you have enough clearance
underneath..)
