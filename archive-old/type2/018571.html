&gt; Hello All,
&gt;
&gt; I'm looking for a  vinyl spare tire cover with VW insignia that fits on the
&gt; spare on the front of the bus.
&gt;
&gt; I have checked all over, none seem to have it with the VW insignia.
&gt;
&gt; Can anyone tell me if they have seen such a thing.
&gt;
&gt;

I have seen that many times in the Bay Area.  However I always
assumed that the VW logo was taken from the front of the bus
and atttached to the cover.   Now that I think of it..maybe...maybe
not.  I have never seen them aftermarket.
