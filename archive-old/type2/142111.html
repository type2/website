Subject: Wheel bolts WTD (Fri)

Looking for five matching wheel bolts, of the type used on early Type 1 and 2 
VWs, having a threaded portion ~13 mm long, and weighing ~48 grams. The more 
common wheel bolts have ~21 mm of thread and weigh ~57 grams.

I bought new tires for my 69 Bay [NO, this is not about tires... read on!] and 
now need to think about balancing them. Every shop in our area seems to have 
thrown away its old-VW adapter years ago.  After searching for weeks, I finally 
found the aluminum disk I machined for the purpose some years ago.  The disk 
has five threaded holes to mount a drop-center rim; the opening in the center 
of the disk is correct for most US balancing machines.  The idea is that you 
mount the assembled tire+rim on the disk, then place it on the balancing 
machine.  Using the lightest wheel bolts contributes to accurate balancing.

Anyway, if you have a few of the short-pattern bolts, please p-mail me at
  mccomas (at) intercom (dot) net
and we'll go from there.  Thanks and have a great weekend....  Glenn
