Subject: Successful test run

Just wanted to let y'all know my 1600SP rebuild had a successful 20-minute
test run today.  Really smoky at first, due mainly to thepaint on the  
brand new
extractor (that I won in the vanagon_dot_com contest last year!) burning off.
No bizarre noises.  Tried to keep the tach moving around the 1500-2500rpm
mark.

I'll check valves, change out the oil and run 'er again, lather rinse &amp;
repeat a few times, &amp; should have a resurrected motor in time for Easter.
Pa-dum-pum.

I'm excited.  Ah rebuilt a in-GINE, momma!
