Hey List -

As with most people, as the engine rebuild progresses, I find lots of other
side projects for the bus. This one bugs me; my windshield has a foggy halo
around the perimeter. I seem to remember reading somewhere that rubbing it
with very fine steel wool followed by polishing with newspaper would work
like a charm on this. For obvious reasons, I haven't tried this yet and
won't until I get all y'all opinions. Am I crazy or is my memory just going?

TIA!

Tom
