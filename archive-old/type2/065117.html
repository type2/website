Bill: just a quick follow up. I checked into the VW price for the BA6 wiring
harness: 900.00 dollars (Canadian if that makes you feel better) and 340.00
for the air-recirculation fan. Hang on to those parts!

Cheers - DC.


ps. Until I see some hard and fast numbers on the Kendall oil debate I
remain sceptical.

&gt;What is your symptom?  Sure it's not a matter of a safety (ie eg &quot;if no
&gt;fuel pressure, don't power the glow plug&quot;)?
