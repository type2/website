Subject: RE: Winter gas mileage

I get about the same figures but for mainly city driving and imperial
gallons.  I haven't got so much data for summer driving though because I
tend to do at least one longer trip with each tankful, which pushes the
average up.

There are other factors which must come into play too, like increased use of
lights and heater, more effort charging the battery, turning the engine and
trans in cold oil, etc.

I don't think carbs will draw in more fuel if the air is cold - the amount
is mainly determined by the volume of air, is it not?

$20 per tank - in my dreams :-) - you should think yourself lucky you don't
live in the UK.

&gt; Has anyone else noticed a significant drop in gas mileage 
&gt; with colder weather?
&gt; 
&gt; I've noticed it in years past, but this winter it seems to be more
&gt; pronounced.  I am averaging 14mpg in mixed city/freeway 
&gt; driving lately.  I
&gt; know that the increased use of the chokes accounts for some 
&gt; of it.  Does
&gt; the increased density of colder air draw in more fuel as 
&gt; well?  I think
&gt; not, but perhaps I'm mistaken.
&gt; 
&gt; For reference, my typical summer environment is 80-100 degrees F, and
&gt; typical winter environment is 30-50 degrees F.  I usually 
&gt; average about
&gt; 16mpg in the same driving conditions in the summer.
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe it's something to do with the gas they sell in the winter?  I'm
&gt; getting tired of getting only 200 miles per $20 tank.
