Subject: Upper Starter Bolt

Hi Folks,
    I just thought I'd share with you something I've done to make
getting my starter in and out a little easier.  Any of you who have
removed and replaced your starter know what a PITA that upper bolt can
be.  Once you loosen the nut on the back end of it there's nothing to
keep the bolt from spinning, and that makes it hard to finish getting
the nut off.  And of course reinstallation is just as hard because the
bolt spins when you try to get the nut started.   Here's a picture of
my solution to that problem.  You can click on
http://photos.yahoo_dot_com/lihikers    and then choose the VW Bus Album.
In there, click on the picture titled Starter Clip.  I'm sure it won't
take long for all of you to exceed the bandwidth limitations of the
site, so try again later if you can't get to it.
    I recently had the starter out of our &quot;71 for it's annual check
up.  While it was out I made that clip to make it easier on myself for
reinstallation.  The clip  has 2 legs at 180 degrees from each other.
The wide one bends up along the flat side of the bolt head and the
other bends down along the starter mounting flange.  Just make sure to
cut the legs so that they don't extend past the bolt head or mounting
flange.  A quick dusting with some flat black paint ought to slow the
rust down.  While this isn't the perfect solution it did make
reinstalling the starter easier and was easily made out of materials
at hand.  I hope this clip can make your VW maintenance just a little
easier.
