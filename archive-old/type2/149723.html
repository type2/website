The support is amazing.  Thank you.

Well, guys, first, I am not a cheat or anything like that, when the PO 
breaks the ignition key so you can't start your new van and then doesn't pay 
to have it fixed... you scramble to protect yourself.  I am a very honorable 
buyer and I really believe that I was misled.  Before I drove to NY I called 
the PO and again for a third time assured me it would get back to Philly 
where I could work on it. Recently I recieved a VERY inappropriate e-mail 
ffrom the seller and I now know for a fact that he knew all about this van's 
troubles and was trying to rope someone in.  I will never resolve this 
fiscally, that is for sure.  It was a bad judgement call on my part, but I 
don't deserve to be ripped off.  Paypal already deciding that the seller 
significanly misrepresented the vehicle.  Either way, I'm going to get what 
I wanted anyway, a van I can work on myself.  I was going to rebuild the 
engine anyway, that was always my thought.  Let's not argue about that 
stuff... the van is the important thing now.

The engine is aircooled, anyone a decent one hanging around and wants some 
bucks for it should definately contact me (I beilive that I did get one 
offer already).
Though someone suggested that I bag it altogether because its so slow... I 
drive an 88 civic now that goes from 0-60 in, well, pack a lunch is all. 
What does everyone else think?

Someone suggested getting an aircooled and swaping everything out, but I 
thought that air-cooled were less complicated, cheaper and easier to 
maintain?  Other advice?

Also, brake parts and fuel lines are on my list if someone has some 
collecting dust (not rust) and want to get $$ for them.  Otherwise I'll 
order from a store.  The van body is beautiful and rust-free, I think that I 
am going to at least get it home to my house for a thorough inspection 
before I throw in the towel.  I think that eventually though I may go with 
an engine that has more power and won't get so worn from the high-top weight 
and resistance. My goal is not a perfectly restored VW, my goal is a strong 
running camper that I can work on myself.  But I'll take &quot;running vw&quot; 
anyday.  Sluggish is not really an issue, I don't like the highways anyway, 
my concern is that backroads are hilly and the AW is bulky.

You guys really are amazing, see &quot;tow-a-thon&quot; post for more details on how 
to get a case of your fav beverage.

Doug, I would love to get ahold of a working ignition set and would like to 
talk to more about it (dangordon0128_at_hotmail_dot_com).


Jon I would love to consider this engine.  Clean? Miles? History?  Lets talk 
about it.


&quot;**If it helps, my buddy has an air-cooled Vanagon motor sitting in his 
garage that he said he would take $500 or so for...

You might want to talk to Chris Turner (Jordanvw) on the Vanagon list about 
parts and/or motor swaps...  He is very knowledgeable and he is up just 
outside Allentown...

Dan,
I'm down near Hartford, CT., and have a decent used 1.9l waterboxer for 
sale.
Ran great around the neighborhood, before parting it out (read: NO ROOF!!!)
Also have a vanagon cylinder lock/ignition switch with key, and a locking 
gas cap both used, but good. I think that AW Vanagon was one that caught my 
eye, but for some reason, didn't follow up on. In any case, good luck, and 
let me know if I can help.
Doug in CT

&gt;I booght a very beautiful Adventurewagen on ebay about a month and a half 
&gt;ago for a cool $1600.  Too good a price.
&gt;
&gt;It lives in upstate NY and I live in Philadelphia.  The PO told me that 
&gt;while it had been sitting, with some fresh gas and a quick fluid check 
&gt;she'd make the trip back.  Those of you who suggested I take a HD wrecker 
&gt;were right on the money.
&gt;
&gt;Get this.. I get there and the van  is gorgeous.  Original KOA interior in 
&gt;near perfect condition. Original curtains, camping gear screens, 
&gt;everything.  I am very impressed.  I wanted to get some gas in her and 
&gt;start her up so I asked for the ignition key from the PO.  The gas tank had 
&gt;a locking cap.  After trying to open it with the only exsisting ignition 
&gt;key, I stopped and rethought what I what doing.  I didn't want half a key 
&gt;and no way to start it.  The PO suggested that he try so I could get 
&gt;everything ready to go.  He tries a little too hard and *snap* the key 
&gt;dies.  Now I have no way of knowing whether it will start or not... I have 
&gt;the van towed (because i'm an idiot) to a nearby respectable VW garage in 
&gt;the hope of the PO paying for a new ignition in the morning.  After three 
&gt;days (and having to drive all the way back to philly) I had not heard from 
&gt;the PO.  I did hear from my mechanic though.  Motor blown, all wheel had 
&gt;seized from rusted brake lines, huge rusted hole in the muffler.  Those are 
&gt;the things he had theheart to tell me.  I don't know that rest.
&gt;
&gt;A huge dispute with paypal, ebay, my credit card and the PO. I win with 
&gt;paypal and ebay... because non of these problems were revealed in the 
&gt;description. I get $175 dollars back when paypal clears the PO's account.  
&gt;Bummer.
&gt;
&gt;So now, instead of being &quot;stuck&quot; with the van, I would like to change my 
&gt;attitude and be blessed with a near perfect van...  here are the things I 
&gt;would like to ask the group:
&gt;
&gt;1. Can I really do the work to the engine of this van?  I am handy and have 
&gt;all my own tools already and can read pretty well.
&gt;2. What are my options as far as a motor goes.  Should I trade in my core 
&gt;and buy a new one, or should I try to rebuild her myself.
&gt;3. How do I get a high top van home 300miles from upstste NY.  4. How do I 
&gt;do all thins without selling my guinea pig into slavery.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks everybody for support throguh this... if you have any questions or 
&gt;help, please e-mail me
