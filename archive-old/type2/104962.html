Subject: RE: [T2] Two questions---Keys &amp; Fuses

&gt; second question: (and a two part one at that)
&gt; where do you suggest i get keys cut? my bus has one
&gt; key and i am having a hard time finding someone with a
&gt; blank to cut me a new one.....also, is the ignition
&gt; key the same as the door key? or where there 2 back
&gt; then....?
&gt;

I had the same problem finding a place to make keys.
I finally found some at the largest locksmith in town. They were twice as
expensive as regular keys, but what are you gonna do?? I got three, just in
case!
Call around to the locksmiths in the phone book. Someone will have them.
