I've had good luck with WD-40 and marvel oil for getting stubborn calipers to 
release.
Let them soak and try to work them.  Do not force until all other tries are 
exhausted.  Then you know if it still doesn't release you'll be in need for 
some new ones and a little force won't hurt any.  Also make sure the bleeder 
screw is open and sometimes you have to pull the brake line too.
