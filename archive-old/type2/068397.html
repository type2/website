&gt;I look at all types of VW's and their
&gt;drivers when I'm on the road and like what I see. I should probably watch
&gt;the road.  My point is that these cars are part of the grand VW family.
&gt;Yes, VWoA is lame but lets not compare VW's to the Saturn. Apples to
&gt;Oranges.

Not anymore. A Golf and a Saturn, apples to apples. They don't make oranges
anymore. An aircooled Bus is an orange. That's what we're complaining
about. I like Saturns because they're sold as oranges; even if they really
aren't, at least somebody recognizes the fact that we all don't want to buy
apples. ;)

&gt;I will always
&gt;drive VW's. They build great cars, maybe not as effecient as a rice
&gt;burner, but the people who drive put themiare in a class by themselves.

Well, people who buy modern VWs certainly are unique. Anybody who would buy
a car simply because VWoA had tied a BICYCLE to the top of it is definitely
unique. If I ever get that unique I hope somebody takes my temperature. ;)
