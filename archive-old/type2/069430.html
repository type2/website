&gt;&gt;I just returned from the garage and hada look at the head in question. The
&gt;&gt;intake vlave seat on number was not dropped or dislodged by pushed
&gt;
&gt;Is that not &quot;by&quot; and instead &quot;but&quot;?

I bet you're right.  The t and y keys are right next to each other.
&quot;Pushed in a fraction&quot; is the same as &quot;dropped&quot; from what I understand.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;in a fraction. There was exhaust etc from where the head was not meeting
&gt;&gt;the cylinder. Any one familiar with this one?
&gt;
&gt; &quot;where the head was not meeting the cylinder&quot;  Do you mean that the head
&gt;was not sealing the against the cylinder?
&gt;
&gt;Hmmm, your above paragraph needs to be proof read.  Maybe your head nuts
&gt;needed to be retorqued.  That would certainly lower your compression test
&gt;numbers (and would make the engine quite loud). This is also a fairly
&gt;common problem and one a careless engine builder might overlook.

Another possibility is that the head could be warped.  Or, it could have
been missing the thin sealing rings that go between the cylinders and the
heads.
Either way, that's probably why your compression is low, and the other head
is probably leaking too.
&gt;
&gt;If there is a problem with the sealing surface of the head,  then I would
&gt;have a discussion with GEX.  It is possible they put a messed up head into
&gt;the engine which is a definate no-no.  Did they claim to give you new or
&gt;rebuilt heads?  Either way, if they put a bad head in I would give them
&gt;hell if I were you.

They almost certainly gave him rebuilt heads.  I don't think new ones are
available any more.  I think all of their rebuilt heads are &quot;messed up&quot;.
That's just the way GEX does things.  Fast and sloppy.
