Subject: Re: [T2] Need Westfalia table top

&gt; my bus over 3 years ago and have been table-less less since then ...
&gt; If you have an extra table top and are attending Buses'n Boats,
please just bring it along.

Greetings. I bought a 78 or 79 deluxe interior last Summer (can't
remember which) that I'm slowly getting installed into my '72. It
didn't have a table :( I hadn't really thought through how I was going
to resolve that. I figured I'd get the dimensions from somewhere and
cut a table top from plywood and lamitate it. Since I don't have the
table, nor have I had the opportunity to see one firsthand, what does
the mechanical connection to the swivel look like? How does it connect
with the underside of the table? Could this be reproduced through the
local pipe/plumber supply or are these parts very specific that need to
be Westvalia parts to function properly.

On the interior install, the vibration deadener is as complete as it
will be (full floor, over 50% of covered interior walls - visible steel
not touched, some inside engine bay - d side &amp; firewall) and its purdy
quiet. I have more material, so I'll do more as the mood, noise and
convinence strikes me. Up Next: expose a hole in the belly pan for the
sink drain (floor hole cut), poke a hole for the water tank drain and
make a hole for the city water inlet - debating putting that under the
belly instead of in the side. Opinions welcome.

TIA,
