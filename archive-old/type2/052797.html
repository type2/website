Subject: New German Side Tents Available

I have a new model of German Bus tent in stock.

http://EuroCampers_dot_com/Tourmobil.html

This is a less expensive and lighter weight tent, but is still well made and 
durable.

Listmembers can take 10% off any tent we have in stock.

I also have the Nizza II at a new lower price, and a few Nizza I tents in 
stock.

P-mail for more information.
