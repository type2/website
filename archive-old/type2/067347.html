Subject: master cylinder and new brake line installed!

I put on the master cylinder and the new brake lines.  For lack of another person to 
help me I couldn't finish tonite.  However, I am concerned about this:

I thought I would be able to somewhat pump the system up to where I could feel some
pressure under the pedal, regardless of bleeding the lines.  Is this not so?
I can hear a very audible skoosh-skoosh sound when I lay under the bus and work the
pedal.  I do not see any fluid leaking out and everything is tight.  Yes the system
is full of air, but should I be able to hear it, or is that an indication of trouble?
I'll do the brake bleeding tomorrow, but I am not confident.  Either way, I value
your advice!
