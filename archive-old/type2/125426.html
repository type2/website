Subject: RE: [T2] Did Westfalia do Hightops?

&gt; Does anyone have pics of these? I have seen the Helsinki and 
&gt; Berlin Westies, but no hightop Westy, at least not a 
&gt; Baywindow. 


I couldn't say whether or not they had a hightop baywindow Westy. I do
know they made hightop T3 (Vanagon) Westies.
