Subject: Re: [T2] Yet another Not-a-new-bus

Hi Tony,

Interesting. What I was thinking was something like a standardized chassis and
design spec that once finalized would be arbitrarily frozen for a minimum of
ten years. This would allow the manufacturers time to implement the design and
to plan for an economy of scale.

It seems to me that &quot;just-in-time&quot; manufacturing and planned obsolescence are
very expensive technologies to utilize in vehicle manufacturing. Our beloved
type2s didn't need these technologies to be popular. They were popular because
they were useful and affordable.

Good design makes a vehicle useful. Standardized manufacturing can make it
affordable. The problem is that there's no incentive for this in the current
automotive industry.

Happy Trails,

Greg
