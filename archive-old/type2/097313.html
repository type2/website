Subject: Re: [T2] Brake pressure regulator is OK (maybe), master is out?

[...]


&gt; OK, I tried Karl's suggestion of loosening the output line at the
&gt; pressure regulator. A good healthy squirt of fluid came out when the
&gt; brakes were applied.

Good, this means the regulator and master cylinder are good.

&gt; I don't get any fluid from either of the rear wheel bleeders.
&gt; So, if fluid is moving through the pressure regulator but doesn't reach
&gt; the rear wheels, does this suggest that the master cylinder is dead? Or
&gt; maybe I have a kink (or blockage)?

Blockage. Replace the rear flex hoses.
The fluid goes from the reservoir, to the master, out the master, to the
regulator, out the regulator, to the rear wheels. You are blocked after the
regulator.
