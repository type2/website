&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No, that pic [fig 5-2] is of the manual trans decel valve. The auto
&gt; trans
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decel is a tall cylinder. The hose that goes to the valve from the big S
&gt; hose
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is rubber with a small end on it. Not the large cloth covered hose.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Go here: http://www.bug-bits.freeserve.co_dot_uk/ramva/fiche/t201810.gif
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; #5 is the manual trans decel valve
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; #47 is the cloth covered hose
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; #4 is the auto trans decel valve
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; #45 is the rubber hose
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; and currently I have #6 on there....????? curiouser and curiouser
&gt; 
&gt; That is correct for your auto trans bus. It should have part number 022 133
&gt; 551C on it. The large disc style pictured in the Bentley is the manual trans
&gt; one, it ends with a B.
&gt; You should have a U shaped rubber hose between it and the big S with part
&gt; number 022 201 919C on it.
&gt; 
&gt; What is wrong with your valve?

not positive but when I start it then it idles but after driving it will
not return to an idle
