Subject: Re: [T2] Paint, or, in which I Investigate Airbrushes

I also have just ordered a top-of-the-line Aztek airbrush on eBay, and same
deal.. they let you think you are getting a terrific price, then come to
find out everyone who sells these things can give you the same price.
I want to use the airbrush mainly for sculpture and art.
I am also looking at the airbrush as a way to do precision repair of paint
chips and dings or rust spots. I have an old 1947 horse trailer that I want
to paint with some mural-like scenes, eventually (in my &quot;spare&quot; time, ha!).
The other marvel is the air eraser.. These can do precise areas, debriding
them completely. Good protection needed for your lungs though. They use
special abrasives, and work like a mini sandblaster.. Once again, this would
be a marvelous tool for cleaning up very small areas, killing pinhole rust
and prepping small parts. They are not as expensive as an airbrush.
I would never consider using any sort of pneumatic paint delivery system
around anyone's face and eyes, however. High pressure paints and inks can
actually inject themselves into pores and under the top layer of the skin
(epidermis), possibly causing toxicity and permanent tattoos. Not a good
idea for childrens' face painting, but could make some lovely, groovy,
hippie and flower-power art on a fun bus.   Jan B
