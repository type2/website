JT,

I firmly agree with Mark on this.  Three weeks is not enough time.  I hate
to advise that you do a road trip in other than a VW bus (I have crossed
the US in one a dozen times or more and as far as I am concerned, it is
the *only* way to travel! :-), so I would recommend waiting 'til spring,
but if time is a problem, I would sooner you did it in an Astro than in a
bus that has had a &quot;hurry-up&quot; rebuild thrown in at the last minute.  The
odds are very good that you would run into more problems hundreds of miles
from home that would spoil the trip at best and leave you stranded and
riding home on a greyhound bus at worst.

On one level, buses can be the most enjoyable and reliable vehicles going,
but that enjoyability and reliability depend on you being familiar with
the mechanical condition an quirks of the bus.  When I get a new bus, in
addition to any engine work it may need, I check out the brakes, steering,
and shocks as well.  Then I go to the standard safety stuff (lights,
wipers, horn, etc.) Lastly, I check out the CV's and wheel bearings.  One
or more of them usually need work of some sort.

I've been at this a while, I've bought a fair number of buses, and I gotta
say that Marks' six month estimate is pretty close to right on for me.  
Last winter I bought a bus in anticipation of a trip I was planning in
June.  Spent much of the spring getting the engine together and in (I am
still resisting telling the stoy of that install because it is still not
over), then took a 10,000 mile trip around the US between Memorial Day and
July 4th.  Spent about 1/4 of my vacation in various repair shops getting
various jobs done that I coulda done at home for 1/10th the price because
the van was, realistically, not ready for the trip :-((( 

If you start out tomorrow morning by ordering a rebuilt engine, it will be
at least a week before it arrives, then another week to install it.  This
would leave you with a whole week to check the rest of the systems and
break the engine in properly (which takes at least 1000 miles of driving
at varying speed and 2 oil changes).  If you do *nothing* else for the
next 3 weeks, and it turns out the bus is perfect other than the engine,
it *might* be possible, but I would put it on par with a 2-year BS degree
program in EE.

On ordering a rebuilt vs. doing it yourself, you will not save money by
doing it yourself.  You might get a better engine, but you won't save
money.  Engine rebuilding, done right, is a demanding high precision task
that takes time, knowledge, and tools.  You will be the best rebuilder,
because you have the time and motivation to do it right, but you will need
to buy a lot of tools (mostly measurement tools (micrometers, etc.)) to do
it right, and you will need to learn a *lot* to do it right.  You can do
it, the VW flat four is an excellent first engine to rebuild, and we stand
ready to assist as necessary!  Others have done it successfully, you can
too, but it ain't gonna happen in three weeks.

If you order a rebuilt, the &quot;list wisdom&quot; as you see from other
posts is against GEX (tho my GEX rebuilt went 50K miles).  None of the
mass-rebuilders is perfect, but the most commonly recommended ones are
Mark Stephens High Performance and AVP.  (BTW, we have had a lot of
speculation on Boston Bob, but so far as I know no one who has had real
world experience... anyone want to jump in here with pos or neg
comments??)

I currently have a MSHP Stage II rebuild in my '80 vanagon, and based on
my experience, I would recommend them as a rebuilder of stock engines.  
The quality of the rebuild they did was extremely high, and it has turned
in a remarkable performance (14k miles so far) despite a ton of abuse on
my part, BUT... I would not recommend them or anyone else as a rebuilder
of oversize engines!  This is based more on my bad experiences with trying
to get the stock FI system to mate up with the oversize engine than with a
specific manufacturer.  VW's FI is very much hard wired to engine size!!!
It &quot;knows&quot; how much air it is sucking per stroke and if you install a
larger engine, it will run lean and run hot as a result.  In addition the
rest of the drivetrain is sized to the engine.  If you have any desire to
expand your engine size, rest assured that you will have problems with
every other drive train component (clutch, trans, motor mounts, CV's)
sooner or later.  They ain't built for it and they won't take it, not for
very long.
