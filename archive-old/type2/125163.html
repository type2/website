From: &quot;scott lyons&quot; &lt;slyons_at_germansupply_dot_com&gt;
&gt; Not sure if it is available in the USA, but try to find something called
&gt; &quot;Captain PHAB&quot; mold and mildew remover. Available at sailing supply
stores.
&gt; It works. It has bacteria in it that eat the mildew. Really.

Found it.  Time to clean my headliner...

MOLD &amp; MILDEW STAIN REMOVER: Codes 250 - 710 ml &amp; Code 251 - 4 L. - which
contain a mild bleaching agent as well as an effective blend of detergents
and surfactants. Strong chlorine is not present to avoid color removal and
fiber damage in stitching.

MOLD &amp; MILDEW PREVENTATIVE: Code 422 - 710 ml. An enzyme/bacteria mixture
that fits the action described earlier. It can prevent growth as well as
stop growth already in progress.
