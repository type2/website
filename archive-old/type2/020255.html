Subject: cheap welder? 

I see many references to &quot;cheap&quot; $200 wire feed welders in the archives,
but cannot for the life of me find any for less than $400 which is
outside my financial scope, $200 on the other hand is within my grasp.
Can anyone tell me where these &quot;cheap&quot; welders are to be found?  I'm in
new england , I have been told by someone at a vw show that &quot;if you can
breath you can use a wire feed welder to replace panels&quot; but i'm looking
for someplace to learn before i start cutting pieces off my bus.  My
grandfather was a welder but unfortunately passed away before i could
learn from him.  of course actually doing body work will have to wait
for warmer weather but i like to stock up on tools and parts in the
winter.
Thanks alot, you guys are the best.
Jamie
