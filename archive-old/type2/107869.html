Subject: RE: [T2] The Physics of Cooling

Nice clean linear relationships have been known to occur in the simplest
systems in nature, but due to the complexity and variability of the bus
engine mechanicals, cooling system properties, driving conditions,
environmental conditions, drag, etc., etc. there is no way you could expect
a direct linear relationship to exist between any of it's operating
parameters. Any such apparent relationship would most likely be an
approximation, with the actual mathematic relationship being VERY complex.
Only exception would be mechanical motion where things are geared or bolted
together!

How's that for answering the question without saying much lol
