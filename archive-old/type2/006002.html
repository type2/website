...Mark-

I am glad to hear your thoughts, and don't mind the interrogation of my 
methods. In fact, I wish I heard more, in that I want the site to answer 
everyone's questions, and can only achieve this if these questions surface.

..As to your point about the Kool Patch v. Q-Pads: it sounds like you are 
basing your judgement of these two products on a few sentences from my 
site, rather than a real life experience and hands-on experimentation.

I allude to this early in the site, I have been trying variations 
automobile noise proofing and rust prevention for 14 years, trying to find 
the &quot;perfect&quot; solution and didn't arbitrarily settle on these two products. 
They are both, hands down, the best at what they do. If you find a bettter 
undercoating than Kool Patch or a better low-frequency sheetmetal noise 
dampener than Q-Pads, I want to know about it.

I would encourage you to purchase a can of Kool Patch, and at least one 
tile of Q-Pads (or a strip of the (inferior IMHO) 3M Silencer Strips.  Take 
a couple of empty one gallon paint tins, and listen closely to the &quot;size 
and shape&quot; of sound produced by shaking the can with a couple marbles in 
it.

Next coat the exterior of the entire can with Kool Patch. Apply as many 
coats as you choose, but keep in mind that this will translate to the same 
number of coats you would need to apply on the vehicle, and as any user of 
Kool Patch will tell you, this is not easy stuff to apply. Shake the can 
with the rock in it, and listen.

Lastly, put a few very small strips of Q-pad on the can, sides, top and 
bottom. 10% coverage gives good results, 50-60% gives terrific dampening. 
Over 70% gives diminishing returns. (We used close to 95% though). Shake 
the can. Listen. Hear anything?

Finally, (so that the test proves the real-world merits of the two 
products), immerse the Kool Patch covered bucket and the Q-Pad bucket in 
heavy brine, then place them somewhere steamy, like near where your 
household dryer exhausts, or in the bathroom. Check them in a couple days 
Notice which one is rusting, and which one has no corrosion?

I won't be able to convince you through these words, so GO BUY A SAMPLE. 
Once you handle and see these products you will see they are not at all the 
same, despite what the composition is.
