You know, the shop we use for balancing just do it that way. I don't specify
anything in terms of precision, they do. Don't forget that the parts are
rotating very quickly, so any imbalance is multiplied many times when the
engine is running. And you are correct about different types of balance. I
found a nice website:

The company we use in Toronto looks like this place, not as large an outfit,
but they balance mostly industrial parts, some of them are huge. There are
always all sorts of strange objects there in the shop, impellers, fan
blades, huge rollers.
