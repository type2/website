Kent, 
I originally replied to your message with some false info. 
Luckily my message was filtered and I have been set straight.

2 problems occur with mixing trannies across the 
72-75 and 76-79 'families'. 

First the gear ratios are tuned to the stroke of the respective 
engines (76-79 have a 71 mm stroke and hence have a geared up 
4th gear, 72-75 have a 66 mm stroke and have a geared down 4th 
gear). See the location - 
ftp://gerry.vanagon_dot_com/pub/technical/VW-Bus-Relative-Wear-Index.txt
for more specific info on gear ratios etc. 

Secondly, the bell housing, and/or tranny input shaft lengths are 
different in the 2 families. I have hear of this problem from 
2 sources. One is chapter 25 of the 'Idiot book'. (You'll need 
one of the newer copies of the idiot book, mine does not have a 
chapter 25). Oddly enough, a buddy of mine has a 2k engine bolted 
to a 73 tranny and has been running like that for 2 years!

Does anyone know why this mix/match seems to work some of the time?

77 Westy

Hey Volks-
&gt; I have recently acquired a '73 Westy that is in great shape, except
&gt; the tranny is stuck in 3rd(the gear-shifter is in 2nd) and I know the
&gt; engine has seen its share of miles. With this in mind I would like to
&gt; drop a 2.0 in it, when the time comes. I am going to(probably,
&gt; hopefully) get a used tranny from a junkyard. What years should I be
&gt; searching for??? I do alot of highway driving, so I like the idea of
&gt; the later tranny's different gear ratio. Will a '76 or later tranny
&gt; bolt up to my '73 engine? and down the road bolt up to a 2.0?
&gt; I, once again, bow to the great wisdom of the almighty list ;-)
&gt; Cheers,
&gt;    -Kent
