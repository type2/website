Subject: Re: [T2] Poor mans AC idea.


if you have a bus with the ice chest there is a method to your madness.  
Several years back i took an old metal ice chest and put dry ice in it.  
i then put a large heater core in the bottom with tubing running to 
another smaller heater core that was outside the chest.  Put a small 
pump in line between the two coolers and filled the lines and cores with 
antifreeze.  attached a small fan to the outside core and actually had 
cool air blowing.  I never  took it beyond that point but the next step 
would have been to add a second heater core to the inside of the cooler 
with the dry ice. NOTE:::make sure that dry ice vapor (CO2) has a place 
to vent.  note that i used a core that was twice as large in the cooler 
as the one outside.  My guess was that a 4 to one ratio would have been 
far more efficient.
