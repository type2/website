Subject: 88 help please

Hi folks... Please forgive the non type 2 content... but joining the
vanagon list to post one question seemed top heavy... and this does have
lots o vw content!!     A french colleague of mine has recently
purchased an 87 88 westy.  He parked it at work 2 or 3 days ago... and
after his 8 hour shift... went out to start the machine and; no go.

I had a look... as I have an 88... and the only thing I could see was
ther he was out of gas!!!  He put in 10 or so litres... cranked and
cranked, but still no go.  The van was running well previous to this.

Can anybody please suggest what it is we should look for to make sure
the gas is flowing.  There is no smell of fuel in the air... no evidence
the engine is flooded.  It seems the engine wants to start but simply
dosent.  There is spark at the dizzy.

So there ya go...

Any help greatly appreciated.

Barry!

I guess to avoid the type 2 list... would you please p-mail me
