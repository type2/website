Subject: A little brake squeaking...

I replaced the rotors and brake pads on my '72 about a month ago. When I
first started driving her again, there was a little squeaking when I
depressed the brake pedal. I figured that there must be a little
&quot;breaking in&quot; period. Unfortunately, it has not stopped. Any tips for
making the noise subside would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Chris
