&gt; &gt; Yes--they charge quite differently.  Gel cells need a better
&gt; &gt; regulation/charging system than &quot;regular&quot; lead acid batteries, and would
&gt; &gt; probably be destroyed, or at least their life significantly shortened, if used
&gt; &gt; in an automobile with a common voltage regulator.
&gt; 
&gt; Miatas use a gelcell instead of a regular lead-acid battery, but Miatas are
&gt; a horse of a whole 'nother color.

Gel-cells are also available for aircraft.  Aircraft charging systems are
pretty much off-the-shelf automotive parts with aircraft price tags.  The
manufacturers of these gel-cels don't indicate that anything special is
needed in the charging systems.

I think that the difference is in the usage.  Starting batteries can
handle more charging current than deep-cycle batteries.  Most gel-cells
are deep cycle designs, whereas the aircraft gel-cells are starting
batteries.

I charge small gel-cells by simply paralleling them with the starting
battery.  Never had a problem doing this
