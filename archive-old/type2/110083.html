&lt;&lt; I've had good results with POR15 on both of my old car gas tanks. I used 
the
complete system of cleaner, metal prep, and sealer.

My Bugeye tank is still leak-less after 10 + years...
On another list, however, two guys (one in Australia,
one in the States) reported flaking and clogging with-
in a year of the complete process...The guy in Aust.
is particularly anti-POR-15, having used it on ex-
posed metal on his property...It's a shorefront home,
so a harsher environment than many and more in need
of the POR-15 protection...YMMV...
As far as POR-15 goes, like Moulder, &quot;I want to believe&quot;...
but ?-(
I suspect a perfect application might return the results as
expected, but even a tiny pinhole or miss seems to be the
culprit...
