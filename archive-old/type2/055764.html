Subject: Antenna location Q, early splits

Ok, it's Friday, it's an VERY narrow subject, but
it's bus related.  On Thom's www.vintagebus_dot_com
site under More Bus Pix is a copy of an advertisement
showing a '63 Deluxe.  After closely checking out the
ad I found the following odd bit.

The antenna is located at the left rear of the bus!
Do the early busses have antenna's in this location?

Where does the very long antenna cable run to the
front radio location?
