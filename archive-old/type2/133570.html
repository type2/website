&gt; On occassion I happen to see both Beetles and Buses being towed behind RV's

&gt; I was always told you want to keep the drive from spinning in neutral because
&gt; the transmission would heat up over a long distances. Is this true or false?

it is certainly true of auto trannies, VW warns that auto trannies should
not be towed more than 30miles nor more than 30MPH ever

there is no oil pump if the engine is not running,  no oil pump no lube,
no lube bearings will quickly overheat.....
