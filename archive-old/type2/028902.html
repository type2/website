Hey folks,

I had this message posted to a forum I run. Can anyone help out with this
search. The posted was.....

Somehow all the emissions control parts were taken out of my '72 VW
camper...and so they want to take me off the road... I'm not a mechanic I
just love my van... am looking for an honest knowledgeable mechanic...
preferably on the north side of Chicago...who will not remove parts I
need... but who will let me know what I need to order, and then put it in so
I can keep my camper on the road... can you help?

Thanks folks,

Joe Mitchell
