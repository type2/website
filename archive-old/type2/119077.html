Subject: add pop top to transporter

Has any converted a transporter (73 bay) from standard roof to a westy pop
up?
Welding and body work is no problem.  I want ot know if it is the dimensions
of the two busses are the same.  If it is possible do I need to ge the westy
roof from the same year?
Any suggestion would be welcome.
