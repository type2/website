Subject: MosquitoScreen

I have a rear hatch mosquito screen that is in very good condition but it does
not fit my '71 van.  The snaps on the screen just do not line up correctly
with the existing snaps on the van.  I do not want to move the snaps on the
van as I have a mosquito screen that does fit them and I have had the mosquito
netting in my screen replaced with no-seeum netting.  I assume that this spare
screen that I have fits newer vans (72 - 79 perhaps?) so if anyone has a real
need for a rear hatch screen please email me and I will let you have it for
the cost of the postage.  I am in NC, close to Raleigh.
