Subject: 009 dizzy vs vacuum dizzy on a FI bus


does anyone know what the drawbacks (if any) would be if I put a 009
dizzy in my '78 FI bus.

my current vacuum dizzy isn't advancing correctly anymore. I know the
vacuum hoses are fine, but I think there's a price of plastic in there
from the little cable clip doodad thingy that fits into the side of the
dizzy where the cables go into if for my compufire points.

I managed to get one piece of plastic out, but I still have 1 piece
unaccounted for.

So in the meantime, I'm thinking about putting my spare 009 in there.

am I losing some 'useful' functionality by removing the vacuum unit?

Thanks
Dave.
