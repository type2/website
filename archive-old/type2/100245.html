Subject: Re: [T2] Is it feasible with my bus! (Big winter trip)

It sounds as though are your very well prepared. As far as parts to bring 
along.....well i keep a spare fan belt, accelerator cable, and clutch cable, 
condensor, coil, plugs, and of course the airs list printed out in the 
states that I'm driving through.

Good luck.






&gt;I would gladly appreciate your comments, advices and suggestions on a
&gt;journey from Montreal Canada crossing all eastern states to Louisiana,
&gt;Texas, Mexico, Arizona (on my way back) and California next February.(I
&gt;have to say that I am a bit scared!!!)
&gt;If you have any advice on which route to take (less possible snow for
&gt;the north parts of my trip = Eastern coast), which spare parts to bring
&gt;or other stuff to &quot;Not forget&quot;. Would you do a 10k+ miles trip with a 30
&gt;years old van especially in wintertime, mostly by myself also!!!
