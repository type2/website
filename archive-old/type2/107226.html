Subject: Re: [T2] Fuses

Beth,

More fuse testing notes.

Most questions of fuse testing is covered at this site.

http://www.dinosaurelectronics_dot_com/Test_Fuse.htm

also,

Harbor Freight VOM  Item 30756-1CRB CEN-TECH $9.99 is on sale for $4.99 (in 
catalog 463). This meter will also work if you want measure low values of 
resistance in the order of 0.5 ohm for some reason.

http://www.harborfreight_dot_com/cpi/ctaf/Displayitem.taf?itemnumber=35761

I have a P30756. It is quite accurate because it uses the 7106 IC chip. I 
have dropped it on hard surfaces many times with out problems.

Here are some readings on a 3/4 amp (not a VW fuse) sample taken with some 
of my shop meters set on the 200 ohm range. All the meters do a good job of 
measuring this low value sample should that be of interest.
The Flukes have an extra digit over the other meters but if you are on a 
budget the CEN-TECHs at less than $20 are hard to beat.


Fluke 8050A #1   0.73 ohm
Fluke 8050A #2   0.71 ohm
CEN-TECH P30756  0.7  ohm
CEN-TECH P35761  0.7  ohm
Tektronix 2237   0.7  ohm
Sunpro CP7676    0.7  ohm


Readings were corrected for the zero off-set reading obtained with the the 
test leads connected together.

&gt;&gt;OK, van's not starting.  It's been suggested to replace fuses even though 
&gt;&gt;they look &quot;good&quot;.  This has been successful for me before, replacing a 
&gt;&gt;fuse that looked good, thereby solving a problem.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;So my question is this:  how do you tell a good fuse from a bad fuse?  I 
&gt;&gt;pulled out my little metal &quot;Sucrets&quot; box of new fuses, and even those 
&gt;&gt;looked kind of oxidized.  Is that bad?  Does it matter?  Is there a way to 
&gt;&gt;test fuses so you know they are good?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thanks for the help.  By the way, '78 Westy 2.0L with fuel injection.
