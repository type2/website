Subject: somthing is not right.
Message-ID: &lt;19991012142011.G14952_at_source.rebelbase_dot_com&gt;

some of you may remember me as the simple question guy, who was
just starting a rebuild of his 1600 dual port.

well, i ended up getting a new long block, and putting it all 
back together.
i kept the heat flaps off, per the long block builders [Pozzi's, 
Sacramento, CA] and also noticed the thermobellows had no place to 
mount on the NEW case the motor came with.
anyway...
she's all back in, and broke in.
running well for almost a thousand miles now.

problem:
the first actual problem is my transmission.
4th has been popping out since i purchased my '68 campmobile...
and now the transmission is likely a twisted mess of gears.
so much so, i belive it is causing unnecessary wear on my 
new engine.
it took a bit to get the timing down, made myself a static 
timing light, and have adjusted the valves a few times.
the problem is now [with the engine] that i am getting
popping during deceleration when the engine is engaged...
like down a hill.
i cannot time it correctly or something, is what it sounds like...
i fried my regulator, and installed a new one, along with points.
i've adjusted that [bosch .009] and seemed to have it adjusted 
correctly.
when i tighten down the points, to the plate underneath it...
the plate seems to move.
a few degrees, but i never really noticed this before.
whether the plate is supposed to move.
at idle... with the clutch engaged in neutral,
the engine changes idle speed...
as if that plate is changing the position of the points
as they ride on the lobes of the dizzy shaft.
is this plate supposed to move, should i get a new dizzy?
is there something else i've missed?

i am g oing to check compressions next... perhaps i've jacked
something up with my transmission, or with it being out of time
or.. well, i just don't know.
i do know, that my baby isn't running right, and i not driving 
her until i know i'm not screwing things up worse by using a 
messed distributer or wrenching tranny.

my baby needs work, to be sure, the suspension in the rear is 
totally hosed, but my main concern is her running operation, 
which is not superb, like it should be.

please help.
please please, my sweet y2k pace vehicle is in poor condition, 
and i'm not sure why.
