&gt; end it turned out to be the  hinge at the bottom of the gas pedal.
&gt; Dirt and debris collects there and causes rust in the hinge.  I'd say
&gt; remove the front floor mat, vacuum out around the gas pedal hinge,
&gt; inspect for general condition as well as for rust, lubricate it good
&gt; and see if that helps the problem.  Don't forget to look at the front
&gt; side, under the pedal, too.  If not, work your way through the
&gt; accelerator system until you find the cause for your problem.  There
&gt; aren't that many parts, it won't take long.
&gt; 
    While doing this put your googles on and take an air blower , blow 
everything off, then P B blaster all moving parts, then spray lube (Wurth HMS2000 
works for me) , now check the throttle . If you can get under the bus then also 
check the tube(if its stillthere) and make sure the cable isn't fraying or 
binding, now while you are under there lube the clutch cable also. Play with it 
you'll figure it out. Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  salem Import Service
