Subject: RE: [T2] Accu-fire rehabilitated?

 I talked to the manufacturer (importer) today about the mag/accu fire and
was informed that the electronics have been upgraded and that they work fine
now. They have released the new version 3 months ago to the public and SAID
they have not had the high return (problems) as the previous versions. It
has taken them 2 years to get the problems resolved. The same problem with
replacement parts exist, which mean none. They feel they are cheap enough to
just buy a new unit instead of a replacement disc, etc. So if you break the
disc you would need to buy a new unit, thus it would cost you more then if
you bought a Compu-Fire that would replace the disc for free.

Subject: [T2] Accu-fire rehabilitated?


I picked up a Compu-fire today from my local vdub
parts house. They also offered me Accu-fire at $20
cheaper.
I told them i had heard ungood things about that
system.
They acknowledged that the &quot;original&quot; accu-fire did
have a high failure rate, but it was recalled and the
problem fixed.

They received the improved accu-fire units a month ago
and have sold several and have not heard of any
problems--yet.

So, who wants to be a guinea pig? I plunked down $70
for the real mccoy. (The VW flaps owner, himself, uses
compu-fire in a baja bug and has never had a problem.)

Still, I wish had taken the time to examine the
Accu-fire, just out of curiosity.
