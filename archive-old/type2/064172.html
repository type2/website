Subject: re: '79 Ac

well, i've seen some aircooled buses with functional ac....it works just don't
run it while going uphill or under heavy loads. i don't think the engine fires
are a result of the ac, i think it is a result of vw bus owners not checking
and replacing ALL fuel lines. ALL of THEM. that is the number one cause of
vw fires. i would reccommend to everyone who buys a bus to change the fuel
lines right after buying the bus.

so, ac may be a heavy load on the bus, but is not the cause of engine fires.
leaky fuel lines. and lazy bus owners are the cause.
