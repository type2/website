Subject: Re: Removable rear apron on busses

&gt;Hi All
&gt;
&gt;Just a small question 
&gt;
&gt;I was wondering what year they stopped putting the removable rear
&gt;apron in bay window busses.  I have a 77 and also had a 76 a while
&gt;back and neither of these have it, what year did it stop?  
&gt;
&gt;Is it possible to retro fit the section into a late model bus?? Does
&gt;it alter the strength or stiffness of the rear end of the bus much?
&gt;
&gt;As I am toying with engine swap ideas at the present, the Subaru
&gt;motors will fit reasonably easily but the thought of a V6 has crossed
&gt;my mind and the removable section would make it a lot simpler to work
&gt;on.
&gt;
&gt;TIA for your help
&gt;

Well as far as I know the last year for the removeable apron was 71. The 
new type 4 motors required a change in the engine bay due to its larger 
size, so I beleive 72 was the first year it was not removable. I would 
not cut it out and make it a removable type because the strenght of the 
bus maybe involed. It is part of the structure of the bus unlike the 
earlier ones. It is not resonable to put an early type apron on a late 
bus, way too different. By the time you cut and welded to make it work 
you could have fabed someting better for less money and effort. If you 
were to weld in some strong brackets and reenforce stuff, it is possible 
to make a removable one but I would really look into the structure part 
of it first. Anybody else done this? Or seen it done?
