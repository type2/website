The final hurdle was to take Cameron for a brain scan on Thursday, just got
the results back &amp; it's all clear. Last night the baby slept in his cot &amp;
only woke twice, so I got some sleep (first in 11 days!). Unfortunately
Denise ran a VERY high temperature last night so we are probably going back
to hospital for a couple of days. Oh well, it's just a precaution, but as
they say &quot;It doesn't rain ''til it pours&quot;.

Peace
