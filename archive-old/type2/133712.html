Subject: Re: [T2] Moday Quiz (Camshaft)

From: scott lyons

the only thing you can easily see is if the cam was meant for auto trans, it
has a ring cast around the center. i seem to recall there being cams with
two rings and ones with one ring, but i might be mistaken.


Okay just through a wrench in it. Is there a difference in an Auto and 
Manual Camshaft? I have an Automatic and never thought to look.

Thanks,

Michael Knight
