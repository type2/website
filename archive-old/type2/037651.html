Subject: Fwd:  closing sliding door

Hi,

&gt; I am just wondering what the correct way to close my
&gt; sliding door is?

 Slide it smoothly forwards. As the door nears the closed position
place your hand against the back of the door just in front of the
pivot link and help it home. The intention is just to reduce wear
on the link unit.
 The door actually latches at the back, so that's where you should
close it from.

 This is a good habit, not something to get obsessive about. You
can't do it when you're inside the bus anyway, and if you berate
random passengers they'll think you're wierd (wierder?)!

 It's worth training regular travellers, though: family, friends etc.

Cheers,
	W.
