&gt;&gt; 3. the only OTHER cooling medium you have is OIL, so you must keep it
&gt;&gt; up, but not over.
&gt; 
&gt; I know that overfilling the oil is bad, but what sort of damage does it cause?

Too much oil=blown seals.

Startup pressure is what gets you. IIRC, it's around 75psi--highest startup
pressure of any gasoline engine.
