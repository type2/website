Subject: Re: [T2] busloops

Some people don't like to &quot;rock the boat&quot; ...if it ain't broke don't fix it 
just relax and let it float. If everything is calm and serene always, then 
you can't enjoy it as much.

But what are you to do with commercials on TV(like I really watch that much) 
from people like BASF. &quot;We don't make things, we just make them better.&quot; 
Last year I got my bus and it ran and drove. No I could have tuned it, 
legalized it, and drove around as a basket case. No not me I wanted to 
really learn the Type IV or atleast the engine that was in there being a GEX 
of a different year code thab was supposed to be there. Mission 
accomplished, well not yet learning Fuel Injection now. I have all the stuff 
to replace my windshield and have had it for some time. Why don't I just 
replace it? Not sure but my engine is now clean and reassembled, but I am 
still not enjoying it as much as driving it would be, or am I?
