If they are pulling the engine, be SURE that the trans mounts are checked
and the clutch is checked.  A new rear seal should be put on the
transmission and the engine too.

That sounds like a lot, but....it will stop or head off a leak that is
inevitable.....Most of the labor they are going to charge you is for the
pulling of the motor as it is.

&gt; Hi all, just purchased a next to new tank for my '76 FI Bus and have been
&gt; told many things about the procedure.  Been told that engine must be
removed
&gt; and also that it does not for fitting of replacement tank.  My current
tank
&gt; is rusted internally and it must be done.
&gt; Also, what else is needed while tank is being replaced?  I'm assuming that
&gt; everything else can be reused from current tank (sender unit, etc) given
&gt; good shape.
&gt; Thank you all!
&gt; Sean
