Subject: plugs and gaps with CDI

Hi,

I have a tiger 581 and have been using platinum plugs. I have not been able
to prove it but I suspect the plugs are the cause of my drop in mileage. I
also followed the instructions for gapping plugs, which were pre-gapped
wider on platinum anyway I noticed. I installed the CDI module and platinum
plugs at the same time and my power and mileage went down. Starts better
though. Any comments on plugs and gaps with CDI. Regular or platinum? What
gap?
