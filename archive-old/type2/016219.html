Subject: Axle Beam Replacement
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Since I'll soon be replacing the front beam on the '77 Westy I just bought, I 
was just searching the archives for more info (Steve, I liked your message 
&quot;Axle Beam Replacement Seminar&quot;). Someone posted that you must raise the 
front 2 1/2 feet to do the job-this won't be possible in my garage, where the 
work will most certainly have to take place, as I refuse to work on any 
vehicle outside during the winter months (did enough of that in my younger 
days-too old for that crap now) Can anyone confirm the 2 1/2 foot 
requirement? Its interesting, I've seen some otherwise rust free buses with 
rotted beams, and then I 'I've seen a lot like my old '76 that had 
significant rust in the body, yet a solid beam. Go figure. This '77 has a 
pretty solid body and undercarriage, yet the beam is shot. If you didn't see 
my pictures of it, go to &lt;A 
HREF=&quot;http://hometown.aol_dot_com/fonman4277/77westy.html&quot;&gt;77Westy&lt;/A&gt;  and check 
it out. I also added a little humorous touch at the bottom of the page.  
Thanks, Jeff S.
