Howdy bus owners,        While I commend anyone who can build functional
aesthetic cabinetry for their Westies, I surely don't condemn someone who
wishes to pull it out, to make room for their own design.  Unfortunately
for us Earthlings we live in a throw away society where much that is
re-usable becomes just more garbage to be cast away and covered up.  The
Type 2 list has been, and continues to be a great resource to bring
together those in need of parts and services with those in possession of
parts and services.  IMHO, if we can save one more piece of a VW bus for
a future user, then let's do it.  The sawzall idea, although it works,
seems a bit extreme to just accomplish a visibility issue.  I like Rick
Taylor's suggestion to trade custom work for the original cabinetry. 
Seems like a good alternative to turning one more set of cabinets over to
a wrecking yard for destruction.  So........stash the original in the
attic, then swap it here on the list to someone in need...

                             Just my .04,       Kevin  Snow
