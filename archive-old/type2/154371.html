Splice away, Josh &amp; Emma.  Be careful to make tight crimps; do yourself a
big favor and get a serious crimping tool, the kind that ratchets.  You'll
be glad you did!

 Hello everyone.  We're waiting on some home improvements to finish before
we can move into our new house and are currently staying in an apartment.
Woke up this morning to find that someone had broken in to the big green
beastie and STOLEN our stereo.  (Wish I could've been there when they tried
to hock it and discovered it was an original stock stereo from 1978 that
only plays am/fm and has no resale value).  Anyway, they cut ALL of my wires
and they are now too short to reconnect to anything.  Can I splice the
wires?  If not, how do we redo the stereo wiring all the way to the back of
the bus?  We've never done any wiring work before.  Best left to a pro?
