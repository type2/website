Subject: Re: [T2] 73 Westy 5-speed STILL For Sale

It must be something about North Carolinians with Green buses but I would 
gladly trade too! Just from the responses you have received.

&gt;From: &quot;Jason Z Upper&quot; &lt;
&gt;I've seen your Bus firsthand, and I like it.  However, my '79 needs a lot 
&gt;of work, and I need to finish it up before I can consider other Buses.  If 
&gt;you'd like to trade your 914-powered, 5-speed Bus for my '79 (currently) 
&gt;non-runner, you've got yourself a deal.
