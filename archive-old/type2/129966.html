&gt;The big S hose and aircleaner from a Vanagon will not fit on a bay. You need the bay version of each. And the
&gt;big S hose is NLA.
&gt;The EFI engine harness is different on a bay. The ECU mounts in a different corner on the Vanagon, I am not
&gt;sure the Vanagon harness will reach where the bay ECU goes.

I'm tinkering with exactly this sort of thing .. someone Weber-ized my '75 Westy, I got a good deal on a
complete Vanagon FI ('81, CA-spec MT) and I'm checking out how (or whether) it'll fit into the Bus. The
donor Vanagon had the FI brain on the passenger side just in front of the taillight.  So far what I've found
is that the brain fits the slot in my bay, and the wiring harness *looks* like it has the length to reach 
everywhere that it needs to go.  

I don't have the engine in yet to mock up the air intake, but my air cleaner bracket was cut out, so I'll
have to get creative.  I picked up an adapter for the AFM that lets me use one of those cone-shaped
3&quot;-tube filters that the Honda kids are so fond of .. whee.
