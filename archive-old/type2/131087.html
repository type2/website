Subject: silver looking tank in engine compartment on new bus - id

It's on the left hand side of the 74 westie deluxe.

Round silver propane looking tank... what on earth is it.
It has a propane tank under the van behind the passenger
side wheel... I can't figure it out. Haven't really looked at
it hard but any ideas?
