The absolutely classic sign of a massive vacuum leak (ask me how I know :)
One of the big hoses on your car has come loose.  Check both ends of:

The hose to the breather from the bis S tube, 
the hose to the decel valve from the S tube,
the hose from the decel valve to the manifold, and 
the hose from the manifold to the disc brake booster.

I'll put a nickel down that one is out of it's coupling.
