Subject: Re: [T2] pilot bearing felt

Richard (and List),

First off nice hose info at your site.

I just put my pilot bearing/ flywhell / clutch and pressure plate on 
yesterday.  I too was sent a felt ring 111 105 311.  The instructions

http://volksweb.relitech_dot_com/clutch.htm

that I was using mentioned that there would be a grove in the flywheel where 
the ring sits. I could find no such grove and I found no such ring when I 
took everything apart. My old pilot bearing appeared to be fine after 60k 
without a felt ring. I'm not sure that much clutch dust really gets in 
there. Maybe I am missing something (likely).  To sandwhich the felt ring in 
there would have made the flywheel not seat all the way, at least that is 
how it looked to be with me parts.

Sean Bartnik Clucth replacement instructions don't mention the felt ring 
either nor the o-ring 021-105-279 in the flywheel that ends up resting 
around the end of the crank.

I don't know what Bentley says.

I left the ring off.

Not really an answer to your question either, but my $.02.

&gt;I've got the felt ring that goes with the pilot bearing (021 115 311) but
&gt;the vendor sent me the felt ring for the earlier gland nut (111 105 311)
&gt;according to the label on the bag.
&gt;
&gt;Are they the same size?
