Subject: stock dist. with dual webers??

My guess:
The retard side of the dvda dist. seems to be related primarily to emmisions 
control and not performance or economy.  It was probably not as great a 
concern to them as it is to me and from their perspective not worth the $$ 
cost to me for them to set it up.  I have heard it can also increase head 
temps(?). 

&gt;From what I have read and heard, I think it would be correct to connect the 
retard side port of the dist. to a vacuum signal coming from BELOW the 
throttle plate.  (intake manifold or balance tube between the intake 
manifolds)

**Any thoughts here???????  I intend to try this and see if I can determine 
any effect with a timing light and vacuum gauge.  I do know this can be tough 
to do accurately without engine LOAD though.

thanks
