&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt;     20+ years and 2 jobs ago I had available to me a grease that was great
&gt; for cv joints.  We called it moly-d which I think short for molybidum
&gt; disulfide (? spelling) and was used to pack driveshaft couplings on an
&gt; S-62 helicopter Does anyone know if this is a product that is  available
&gt; to the public in reasonably small quantities?  TIA.

J.C. Whitney sells this stuff. Called Moly Wheel Bearing Grease. Their stock
number is: 17LT6569R - $9.49 Page 168 Catalog 624J. I bought a can several
years ago, still have some. Works.
