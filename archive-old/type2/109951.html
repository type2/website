Subject: Re: [T2] Rust removal

Advise on rust removal.

Sand or media blasting is best.
If you can't do that a wire brush on a drill, die grinder, or on a 4&quot;
electric grinder is next best---

Now---for the corrosion that you can't possibly get to---mix the proper
amount of Dupont's metal prep in a spay bottle and mist a coat of this
stuff on the bare metal--it'll get the rest of it--and leave a
protective coating on the bare metal.
This is the way a body shop would prepare the bare metal--and then spray
a coat of Duponts Vari Prime zinc chromate acid etch primer over that.
Sand,fill prime,sand, and paint.
No more rust, and you have a properly sealed surface that will last for
eons.

I have yet to find any body shop, be it automotive, truck, heavy
equipment, or RR train that uses this miracle in a bottle POR-15.


Later,

Terry

I have spots of surface rust that I can sand down to bare metal...when I
do that some of it stays in the pitted areas and I cannot sand it
out...if I cover those areas with por15 will that be sufficient? Or does
it really need to removed completely? I am sanding with 100 grit
paper...what else should I use to get the rest of it out of the pitted
areas? I am going to try some marine clean tonight....
Thanks Volks,
Scott
