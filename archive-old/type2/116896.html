Subject: firming shift linkage, 71 bus

I'd like to remove as much slop from my shift linkage as is practical w/o 
removing the tranny.
Perusing the Bentley, library, and archives, it seems that the front bushing 
and the rear coupling are fairly straightforward to replace now.
Sounds like the 2 nylon bushings on the rear shaft cannot be changed w the 
tranny in.
This is how I understand it, tho any comment if this is indeed true, 
suggestions, or elaboration would be appreciated.
Any other replacement parts or procedures while I'm at it?
TIA
Denny Johnson
