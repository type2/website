Other then the bit about bumping it up to a 1776, Jim does a fair job of
describing it, leaving out all the detail work.

I would most definitly suggest spending the additional 75-150$ to have you
crank/pulley/flywheel/pressureplate/rods/pistons balanced before
reassembly.

And to set and balance the compression ratios..


later....david

ps:  a 1600 is just fine in a bus. If its built well.  And I wont touch
the topic of the tools needed to do the rebuild...
