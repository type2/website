Paul,

Just returned from my local tire shop *Discount Tire, Encinitas, Ca.* .  We
put 4 (*AGILIS*, a  new line for  Michelin)185R-14C Reinforced 97/99R
Michelin,  AGILIS, 61 RBL tires on the 71 westy.  Total $381.98..  That
included computer spin balance, and new rubber valve stems,  No Insurance.
I  thought that was a good deal!

They have a very firm ride (we/ new *KYB* shocks)....

Bob

Subject: Yet another post on tires


&gt; &lt;disclaimer&gt;
&gt; I checked the archives and have seen tons of posts on
&gt; this subject.  I found the correct size and brand,
&gt; called some places.  Not in stock, not made anymore.
&gt; &lt;/disclaimer&gt;
&gt;
&gt; So, I called around to a few more places, explaining
&gt; *exactly* what I needed, and most told me nope, sorry,
&gt; don't have nuthin' for one of those hippie buses.
&gt; Argh!
&gt;
&gt; I called my friends at the Tire Rack and a nice woman
&gt; named Wendy found exactly what I was looking for -
&gt; Bridgestone 603V, 8 ply load range D.  She told me
&gt; that this was a pretty nice tire.  Price? $373.38 USD
&gt; for 5.  Then I called around to see how much mounting,
&gt; etc. would be if I brought my own tires in.  Most
&gt; places will charge me between $15-$25/tire.
&gt;
&gt; Then I called up the local Bridgestone/Firestone place
&gt; - couldn't find them when I gave him the exact
&gt; Bridgestone part number.  Hmmm, so I explained what I
&gt; needed and voila! he found the mysterious 603V.  Price
&gt; was $472.60 USD for 5, mounted, etc.  For another 5
&gt; bucks each, I can get road hazard insurance.  So, for
&gt; a little under $500, I can get 5 new tires, that fit,
&gt; and have road hazard.  Seems pretty good to me.
&gt;
&gt; Any and all comments are welcome.
&gt;
&gt; Paul
