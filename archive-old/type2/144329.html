Subject: Re: [T2] missing lower tins on '79 Westy

On a 79, you need to specify if you have a Calif
version or a Fed version. 2 totally different exhaust
systems. Lower tin is totally different between the 2.

79 Cal has electronic ignition, no resister pack on
the left side of the gas tank panel, an O2 sensor, and
a cat that lays front to rear between the left heater
box and head.

79 Fed looks like a 78 on top, but has 72-74 heater
boxes with square ports.

Go here and look at R and W. Click on each and you get
the year differences.

R is:
R. 021-119-355BU Warm Air Duct, Lower Left, Used 1972
to 1974, 1979 to 1983 Federal Only 

R. 039-119-355AU Warm Air Duct, Lower Left, Used 1979
California Only  

W is a problem for 79, either version:
W. 021-119-356CU Warm Air Duct, Lower Right, Used 1972
to 1974, 1980 to 1983 All 

W. 021-119-356EU Warm Air Duct, Lower Right, Used 1975
to 1978 All  

I may have both but I need to know what you have.....

 It was brought to my attention this weekend that I'm
 missing some
 cooling tin on my bus. Apparently there are pieces
 that bolt to the
 underside of the motor, between the heater boxes.
 Does this sound
 right? Having never seen them installed, I'm not
 sure what they're
 supposed to look like. Do any of you have a photo of
 the properly
 installed pieces that you can send me? I'd like to
 get this remedied
 as soon as possible, although I haven't noticed any
 hot-running
 characteristics so far. Any help is much
 appreciated. Thanks-
