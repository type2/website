just remember, he doesn't like hydraulic valves and it colors some of his

&gt; Try this site it will clear up the problem with the
&gt; book.. Phil

but as he says the book leaves a lot to be desired, maybe I lucked out, I
just stuffed the new empty lifters in, set em touching plus 1.5 turns and
started the engine,  5-10 minutes and everything was pumped up.

that was 30k miles ago so it must have worked reasonably well
I did check and adjust one or two valves at about 500miles and check em
annually since, but they haven't needed touching since then.
