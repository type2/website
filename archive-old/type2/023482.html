George-
            Damp interior? A while back, during a thunderstorm, I was 
driving my 71 Bus and a truck, passing in the opposite direction,
splashed enough water to enter the rear air scoops...Result: The
defroster vents started pouring out enough &quot;fog&quot;, that I had to
open the window quickly and see ahead that way!
