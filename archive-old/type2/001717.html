Subject: cold idle problem

Greetings listmembers,

I have a cold idle problem I cannot solve.  During the first 5 to 30 seconds
of warm-up, when I press the accelerator my bus starts to die.  After it's
slightly warmer, it does fine.  The idle itself is actually okay as long as
I don't give it any gas.

I've checked the aux. air reguator and associated vaccuum hoses, the temp
sensors, and all other vacuum lines.  Everything seems to be functioning
properly.  (I didn't check the cold start valve, but I don't think its
relevant to my problem)  Any suggestions?
