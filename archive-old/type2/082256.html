Subject: Re: [T2] PSI vs. Weight Rating

Firstly look up in your hand book / workshop manual the tyre pressures for a standard tyre, then measure the width of the tread on a standard tyre.
When you get the new tyres measure the width of tread.
Then ... pressure for the new tyres = pressure for standard tyre * tread width of new tyre / tread width of standard tyre.
This will give you a starting point from which you could adjust up or down by a few psi to fine tune the ride quality.
Keep an eye on the wear pattern too - wear in the centre of the tread indicates over inflation, wear at both outer edges of the tread indicates under inflation.

Good luck

&gt; 
&gt; I'm getting (finally!) some proper tires for Itch. Cheng Shin UE-168 
&gt; 205R14C's:
&gt; 
&gt; http://www.maxxis-reifen_dot_de/seiten/pkw/ue168.htm
&gt; 
&gt; I remember an old tire dude in town (since &quot;retired&quot;, if you know what I 
&gt; mean...) once showed me a graph of how much PSI would give you how much load 
&gt; rating on a particular type of tire (passenger, SR rated, C/D rated, etc..).
&gt; 
&gt; As the grid shows, the 205's load rating at 69PSI is 2271 lbs - more than 
&gt; enough.
&gt; 
&gt; Q - What PSI gives me 1800 lbs? If anyone has a listing like the old tire 
&gt; dudes (bless his heart), can you publish it?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks folks!
