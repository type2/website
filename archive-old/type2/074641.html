Bill, et al..

do us all a favor, and dont send things like this to the list.  It has
nothing to do with busses.

It is generally not hard to figure out the actual email address of the
person with the virus.  Send your email directly to the infected people,
not the rest of us.

If you cant do that...please spare us.
