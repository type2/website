Subject: those $#$_at_#!! headlights

Problem:
My headlights don't work. If I fiddle with the turn signal/dimmer switch,
they sometimes come on, sometimes not. The relay makes a clicking noise, but
usually nothing happens.

I went into the switch today and resoldered some connections...and in
classic fashion made the problem worse. Now my dimmer switch relay clicks
when I turn the key! Neat feature, but it doesn't solve my problem (I am
considering having the relay come on when I turn on the wipers, though).

Question: Are such things symptomatic of a bad relay, or a dying switch?
Looks to me like replacing that switch would be a bitch, even if I did have
one laying around, because of all those little connections you would have to
solder.

Bonus question: What could I have possibly done that would suddenly make the
headlight dimmer switch fire when I turn the ignition key?
Bob
