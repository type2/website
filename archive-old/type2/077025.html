In most cases, these repairs are a ploy to get you into their shop where
they will try and sell you a new windshield.

I have used the &quot;do it yourself&quot; kits sold at FLAPS to good effect on a
star crack.  The
repair wasn't perfect (I didn't expect it to be) but the crack is sealed
to water and therefore won't spread when it freezes.  It has lasted
several year like this.

It's important to do it as soon after the chip occurs as you can, as once
water gets in there it won't come out!

Follow the instructions on the kit to the letter, paying attention to the
time and temperature requirements)
