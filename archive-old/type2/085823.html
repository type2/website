Subject: Re: [T2] RichWeber/600v .047uF

Clark
I have the same carb with the same problem--do you
have a type 4 or a 1600?

If its a type 4:
I recently installed a haltech oxygen sensor and the mixture is often pegged 
on the maximum richness.  Once I get my gas tank cleaned out
I WILL figure this problem out with the help of my exhaust analyzer.
Calimports up here sells a complete jet kit for this carb, although they
are now out of stock and the price seems a little on the high side
They advertise a DFEV &quot;jetted for type 4&quot;..one might ask them
what this means.  Busdepot may know as well.
Will let you know what jet combo works for me

&gt;
&gt;List,
&gt;The 2bbl Weber runs rich.  Now begins my trial by fire, i think.  Steve
&gt;Lashley - remember that swap at BBTA - 99?  I traded you the rear upper
&gt;storage cab? Same carb - same guts.
&gt;If i remember, you said you and a mechanic tweaked this thing before you 
&gt;went
&gt;to duals.  Any chance of remembering what main jets are in it?
&gt;Does anyone know what the stock jets are on a weber prog (DFEV)? Is there 
&gt;such
&gt;a thing? Online resource i've missed?
&gt;
&gt;Also, unrelated - i need a capacitor - 600v (or 630) .047 microfarad for 
&gt;tube
&gt;amp. I know we have a few electronics guys on the list...no one local has 
&gt;one
&gt;and i can't meet the minimums online. Pmail if you have any info.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks very much,
&gt;
&gt;Clark Gordon
&gt;Morehead, ky.
