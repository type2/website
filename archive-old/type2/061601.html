Michele and Stella were in the 72 and I was about 30 yards behind them in
the 69. As we approached a stop sign I noticed some teenagers point a The 72
and say &quot;Wow, look at that&quot;and then a second later as I pulled up behind the
72 they screamed with wonderment, &quot;Oh my god,there are two of them!&quot; 

A couple of months  ago I was traveling through town on a four-lane road
with no other cars in sight. I was doing  25mph in a 35mph zone and enjoying
the ride. Suddenly, from nowhere an angry motorist pulls up beside and
screams at me, &quot;HEY YOU, THE SPEED LIMIT IS 35!&quot; I thanked him and waved as
he speed away down the enpty road.
