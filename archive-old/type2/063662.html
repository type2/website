I sent off for my Busboys catalogue (with my $5.00) back in the spring...no
result yet.  I have the following catalogs: 1)J.C. Whitneys VW catalogue (I
throw the other ones away) Slow to come  2) Parts Place .. Ship really fast.
3)Rocky Mountain  Great catalog..ship fast   4)West Coast Metric   5)G.E.X.
Bought a 1680 S.P. a couple of years ago for the '69  No complaints.  Wish I had
more!  John Jensen in Annapolis
