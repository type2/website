Welcome.  Hop the van treats you well.  Nothing uses up a battery like
electric heat (except a short circuit).  Better plan on something else.  An
under the vehicle gas heater was a common item on Canadian vans, of which
there are many.  You should be able to find one, if you really care.  Other
than that, a catalytic heater is about the only option, but you get masses
of condensation, which isn't good for the van.
