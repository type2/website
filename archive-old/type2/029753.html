I have friends who have had good luck with the Good Sam organization.
They are a lot friendlier to folks who pull trailers than the AAA.

OTOH, I used to live in a semi-rural area and apparently the local
Good Sam affiliate was telling folks that it was OK to dump their tanks in
a drainage ditch about 1/8 mile from our house.  When it rained, guess
where their effluent went?  Yep, right down the ditch in front of the
house!  Whenever we caught someone dumping they invariably had a
Good Sam sticker on the back of their vehicle.  Always had a bad feeling
toward the Good Sams organization since.

&gt; Every month since I have received a membership solicitation from the Good
&gt; Sam Club.  I just toss them out unopened.
&gt; 
&gt; However, we often see VW campers with Good Sam Club stickers in the window
&gt; so they must accept VWs as members.
&gt; 
&gt; FWIW.....

&gt; &gt;&gt;  Ya'll might look into Trailer Life's 'Good Sam' club.  A Westy *is* a
