Make sure that the oil is GL4. I'm suspicious about oils that are both
GL4 and GL5 rated. GL5 is corrosive to the brass synchronizers in the
transmission. Of course, I don't know how long it will take GL5 to eat
the sychronizers.

Redline makes a synthetic that's GL4

By the way Mobil 1 synthetic gear oil is GL5 and is not recommended for
VW trannies. Mobil told me that when I called their 800 number.

 Hi,

I am going to change my transmission fluid this weekend, just because I
do not know the history of when if ever it has been replaced. I looked
in the archives and it seems that others agree that it is a good idea to
change it, even if it is not stated in the Bentley to do so at regular
intervals. Do you all still agree? Is there anything I need to know or
helpful hints.

My main question is it okay to use Valvoline 80/90 synthetic gear oil?
What are GL#'s I see mentioned in the archive posts? Are there pros or
cons to synthetic gear oil?

Thanks

Meg
