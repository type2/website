&gt; The A/C installation in my '72 Bus is proceeding
&gt; without too many problems.  &lt;SNIP&gt;
&gt; I need to know, measuring from the metal floor, the
&gt; distance to the middle of each stiffener. &lt;SNIP&gt; 
&gt; I have many pictures of this &quot;work in progress&quot;. 
&gt; Does anyone know of a good place to post them?

Last question: I use Yahoo Photos. Check out my albums
- the link's in my sig.

1st question: From the high part of the floor, dead
center of the bottom one is 9.5&quot; and the upper one is
18.25&quot; That is on my '74 which had the panel still on,
but your welcome... (It needed to come off some day
anyway!) -BaH
