Is there anything simpler it could be? Bent pushrod? Do you know the sound of a rod?

Perhaps you can perform the old 'which rod is knocking' test. pulling spark plug wires one by one as it idles and it will stop knocking when you have the right one. It will still
have to come apart anyway, and this may put additional strain and metal into your oil tho' so seems a bit pointless.

My condolences.

If it is a rod, it will be apparent, grab one and pull back and forth, don't mistake the normal side to side movement rods have.

I don't know how difficult it will be to check the crank without opening the case.
