Subject: Exhaust install help!

Hello-
 
Yesterday I took on the task of replacing the exhaust on my 1970 bus, 1600 upright.  It was a task in itself to get the old one off.  It was pretty much rusted on there.
 
Tonight I'll be trying to fit the new one on.  Yesterday when I tried it, things just didn't line up nicely.  Is this a common problem?  I've replaced an exhaust on a 1969 beetle before and had no problems.  Also, what is the bar that runs parallel to the movement of the cylinders, beneath the exhaust and is bolted to the engine block?  It's kind of in the way.  Can I remove it during the install to make my job a little easier?  Also, any general tips that you might think would help.  Thanks in advance for your help.
 
Courtney
