Subject: RE: pedestal mats don't fit!              

are you talking about the carpet that wraps around the front seat
pedestal??? if so i have that problem too....TMI didn't seem to have any
answers for me about a fix, i'll probably cut the seems apart to make it all
fit.......TMI's carpet kit that i purchased had all kinds of size problems,
next time i'll cut my own carpet.

good luck
Ericd.
