Subject: my bus looks stupendous! :)

After having procrastinated this job for about three years, I have
finally decided to pay someone else to do it for me: a complete
buffing, polishing and waxing on the previously pale and tarnished
looking Yosemite Yellow Camper. It looks GORGEOUS!! Like new. The guy
at Ziebart was surprised as well by the result. 

So if you're thinking about a new paint job, try buffing a small patch
with some rubbing compound first...
