Subject: FW: single/double cabs in Europe
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Another lost message from last week:
-------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;He said that the Single Cab and Crew Cab pickups were extremely
&gt;popular in Europe and that you see them all over the place there.

True, they still are. Mostly used as light trucks
by contracters, gardeners etc,

&gt;I guess they stopped making those in 1979.

Not true. VW (and others) still make them. The current model is of course
based on the T4 and has aluminum (or stainless steel) gates.
