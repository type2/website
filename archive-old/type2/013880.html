Subject: Re: [T2] 009 Distributor for sale

Well I'm not an expert but here are the markings:
0.231.178.009
JE4
In an oval it has 908
Below that it has something similar to an H in a tight little circle.
Looks kinda like an apple core after a kid finishes it.
below that it has number 849

Asking $ 50.00 with delivery.
 
German or Brazilian?
 
 IMO, $50 is a good deal for a tight German .009
