&gt; As no spare belt came with my '73 bus, I just

&gt; section is 0.5 mm (a small amount, no?) bigger;
&gt; so do these figures imply that even with numerous

A wider belt would have to be longer to fit with the stock washers.  You
would have to add washers to make a 10x890 fit, if it would fit at all.  I
had to do this a few years ago when I couldn't find the proper 9.5x905
belt.  I learned my lesson and have carried a correct spare since.
