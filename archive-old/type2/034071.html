Again, once more............

The original question WAS.... The wipers and lights don't work when the car is
cold. Where is the easiest place to start looking?  .....  See original post
below.

&lt;&lt;2 mornings in a row Blues headlights and wipers
wont work until he is thouroughly warmed up (about 10-15 minutes depending
on how long it takes me to make myself pretty in the morning) After he is
warmed up, so far, the headlights come on and the wipers work. This strikes
me as odd. Is there any poss cause that I should check first? I dont want to
trble shoot the whole system as it isnt a huge prob(yet) and as I mentioned,
weather is getting rough!&gt;&gt;

I said jump the circuit fuse. It's not a reach to consider the problem could be
a bad fuse fit or loose connection at the fuse wires. And it is one of the
easiest places to start looking. If the owner puts the jumper on prior to
starting the car the result, or lack of one, will be one step closer to
understanding the problem.

Put an inline fuse in the jumper wire if you like BUT  I can guarantee you that
if you short the jumper to ground you WILL see sparks .....well should anyway.

Don't do that.
