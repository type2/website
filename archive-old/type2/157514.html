&gt; We get so little snow and ice here that I can't justify a $500 set of
snow tires.  I remember my Dad, God rest his soul, using a set of  chains
the few days a year that we get snow. I'm considering buying a  set.
Does anyone have experience with them?  Do they tear up  the tires?  The
longest I can remember needing chains was an ice  storm that lasted a
&gt; week or ten days.

Chains are certainly a viable way to go, and sometimes are absolutely
required here in California.  I have a set and if I am going into snowy
conditions I mount them on a spare set of wheels and tires.  It's a lot
easier to change wheels than it is to put chains on!

If you are going this route make sure:

1. Chains are in excellent condition.  Every time you use them inspect for
cracked or worn links.

2. Chains are properly restrained.  Use those rubber stretchers to keep
them tight.  I put two stretchers on in case one decides to break.

3. Never exceed 30MPH with chains on.  Doing so is asking for a broken
link.

4. Keep the chains in the snow.  One problem in California is that one is
often required to put chains on miles in advance of the conditions that
require them, so you have to run on pavement which wears the chains out.
If you have the alternative, run in a lane that has snow on it!

5. Consider cable chains.  Much smoother and easier on the car.  They
don't need stretchers, either.

Before anyone gets mad at me for running my bus in snow, please keep in
mind that I only carry chains as a precaution.  Also, California and
Nevada, where I do most of my driving, do not use salt on the roads.
