I agree, and always do so myself.  I should have mentioned that in my post.

A lot of tire shops use a shot of WD-40 on lug nuts and studs, and it seems
to work pretty well.  I use it often myself, and even many months later
everything comes apart cleanly and without any binding/galling.

I used to use regular antisieze grease/lube, but the WD-40 works so well I
seldom bother with grease anymore.

&gt;&gt;  The tire stores should also be using a neversieze material on all of the
wheel fastener threads.  I always do this, and recommend you'al should do it
too, (neversieze and torque wrench).  &lt;&lt;
