Subject: Re: My jalousies...

James Blankenship sends:

&gt; The PO tinted the windows of my '68 bus and he painted the outside jalousie
&gt; frames (the alluminum part) black to match. Well, i removed the tinting
&gt; because I just don't like tinted windows on my Bus. Any suggestions on
&gt; removing the paint? I was thinking of using steel wool, but I don't want to
&gt; scratch them all up.

Go to an auto paint store and get a little can of Airplane Remover or Wash
Thinner. Airplane Remover is the most potent paint stripper made, and Wash
Thinner is a car painter's cleanup solution. Either one will dissolve
whatever paint your PO put on there.

Be sure to follow the directions on the can to the letter. This stuff
doesn't play games.
