Hi Volks,
I am reading the archives, trying to determine where to time (with a
timing light), my 1600dp engine. I have an 009 dizzy; the engine code
is AH (from what I can determine, that is a '72-'74 T1?); my pulley has
three notches that appear to be 0 tdc, 7.5 btdc, and 10 btdc. This
engine is in a '71 Bus and the info. I get says to time it at 5 atdc.
There is no notch on the pulley for that setting, that I can see.
Anybody out there have the same set-up, and if so could you give me
some advice, por favor'?
Thanks much,
Rick
