Subject: cots for 71 Westie

When my daughter purchased her Westie, there were no cots, neither the
kiddie cot or the longer one that parallels the sliding door.  PO had
even removed the mounting hardware for the long one.  Hardware still in
place for the kiddie cot.

We've located a source for the canvas for the adult cot, but no poles or
hardware and have had no luck finding the kiddie cot at all.

We are also looking for a source for the snap on rear seat and zbed
covers in black.  Is there such a thing out there or should I pull out
the staple gun?

Thanks for any help in locating these items.

Karen
