Subject: Beetle balljoint tools

List,

Apologies for the marginal bus content, but I am in need of some info.

I am looking to make some tooling to press ball joints into and out of the
control arms on a VW thing. I can't find any reference material on these
tools. The closest thing I have are the illustrations of similar tools in
the BUS Bentley. I have looked here:

http://wow.atlasta_dot_net/~mriluvu/oacdp/

But this manual pre-dates ball joint front ends on beetles, so no luck
there.

I wonder if any list member has these tools or has a drawing of them or even
decent photos. Perhaps there is a good image in the beetle Bentley, which I
do not own.
