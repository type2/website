Subject: Re: [T2] BB in vacuum line?

Sooo... would a bad EEC valve be the reason someone put the BB in the vac
line? What would be a sign of this valve being bad? It does seem to be
running rich.

&gt; Fumes that collect in the charcoal canister and &quot;burned&quot; through the
intake
&gt; system via the EEC valve in the air cleaner. When the engine is idling,
the
&gt; valve is closed and no fumes are burned. It also seals the system when the
&gt; engine is off.
