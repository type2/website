Subject: Out of Body Experience wrap-up.

When John Muir wrote his book, he was talking about the complete idiot.  Not
me. While it was a growing experience, it taught me a lot. 

 

Some background:

1978 2.0L FI Rivera Bus &quot;Penthouse&quot; model. 3rd Owner. Bought Jan 4th 2005.
That works just fine.  
The PO had replaced via a local shop: 2 Heads, 8 lifters and basic tuneup
and installed a battery (which died on me) and a new radio.  I believe he
had the bus for 4 years.

 ============================

Recent Past under my ownership:

I have replaced interior panels, used POR-15 on the floor and relayed
plywood/carpet flooring. Yanked out old cabinet/water pump/tank.  Replaced
with new cabinets that work for me. (Still need to put doors and shelves
in).

============================= 

Engine/Transmission out of Body Experience (Started Oct 15th 2005 Ended  Jan
14th 2006) 
Just completed reinstalling the engine/transmission with a lot of help.  

 

This included:
Used fly wheel

New clutch plate and pressure plate

Fuel line (some not all)

New Throw-out bearing (it's a cheap part so why not change it while it's
out).

Transmission Oil Change (same as above. Did not know when it was last
changed, so I did)

4xNew spark plugs

Welded alternator Tin

Welded Exhaust tubes #3 &amp; #4 side.

Drilled #3 sparkplug

New spark plug wires (need new cap/rotor as well)

Replaced whole engine seal.

New Rubber boot on Oil tube (with zip ties)

Painted most of the tin, replaced some broken tin with ones from junk yard.
Really wanted to powder coat it.  Maybe next time.

Replaced gaskets in all areas (except exhaust). Replace them when you can,
not when you need to!

Replaced old stock muffler, with brand new muffler. It was worn and cracked
beyond repair.

Replaced Bowden Tube.    Somewhat worn. Good timing.

Replaced front mirrors.

Replaced fan belt (it was old) (again, replace now and not when needed)

Replaced all CV Joint Bolts (but not CV Joint boots...Saving that for
another day).

Used POR-15 in Battery Tray area along with fiberglass and POR-15 Patch to
stop rust and patch the 3in x 2in hole.

Oil 20w-50 (4.5 qts)
Four Push Rod Tubes

============================= 

Yet to be done:

 

Steering wheel &amp; Adapter

Shifter (need new one since it will have less play that current)

Seats: Current ones are from a 96 Dodge Caravan.  Found cool Vanagon ones
that generally match. Still need to buy.

Install VDO Gauges.

New Cap/Rotor.

CB Radio

Inverter

New Aux Battery (run internal lights to this one)

2x Solar Powder trickle chargers. (already have one, need second).

Bought new side light covers since old ones were bad (not installed yet)

CV Joint Boots

New Hankook Tires

New Brakes/pads

Fix the heat tubes from the heat exchangers up to the front

Paint the Bus Neptune Blue and remove the minor rust.

Replace front windshield.

 

============================

I wanted to do this for a few reasons:

I have never taken an engine out. 
I wanted to learn more about my bus in case/when it breaks down I know what
to do.
Wanted to replace what was needed and replaced what I should before it does.

 

What I learned:

I am not the idiot that John Muir thought I was.  I was below it.  Meaning I
had not a clue as to what I was doing, but thought &quot;Hey, it's a VW.  How
hard could it be anyway?&quot;  My friend Phil asked me if I had had my head
examined lately.  (He replaced his 76 Riviera FI Engine with one that
Porsche's use and he is a mechanical engineer for hotel heating/cooling
company. So he's good at Air-cooled Buses. Also  if you give him a small
garden mower/weed whacker engine that is dead for 5 years, he will have it
up and running the next day.  As he did once when he called me up and revved
the weed whacker up over the phone just to let me know it worked.)


I also realized that one part can stop you dead in your tracks on a Sunday
afternoon, and hoping a FLAPS or Machinist or Junkyard is open.

 

After going through the experience of all it all I have realized one thing:
Next time it's going to the VW shop and I will pay to have the work done.  I
will know generally what to say when I take it in.  Also I will understand
the process that they are going to go through to resolve my issue.  Also, it
will help me explain to them what I exactly done.


The Tires, Brakes/Pads will not be done by me. Going to local shop to get
this done.

 

Anyway, after one full year of owning a VW Bus, taking the Engine out and
putting it back and all the other things I did to it, I still love it.
Still going to drive everywhere in it.  I now feel like a Buspilot and a
true VW Owner.

 

I have Adam Z, Cliff and son Josh Rhoton and Doug Miner to thank for helping
me through this whole process.  I also thank Phil in his foresight on how
crazy I was.  But I glad that I did not take his advice!  (ps: I have a
bigger tank and better MPG than his Porsche driven bus.  He will pass me,
but I will get to the campsite before him!!!)

 

I had to stop doing all that I wanted to do on this bus in order of making
the Wet Westies Nehalem UnSuperBowl party this year if I wanted to get
there.  It's the anniversary of my first WW outing and also first camping
trip in the Bus.  Important dates!

 

Thanks for reading and see you out there!  Sorry for the long post......

 

(I would point you to a lot of photos of the whole ordeal, but I am changing
hosting servers for hueymungus_dot_com and it is not up yet.)
