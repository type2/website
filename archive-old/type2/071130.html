i must tell y'all that there are some wonderful people on this list. on our
trip around the us we met a bunch of listees. if your ever in fresno, ca say
hi to karl (&lt;A HREF=&quot;mailto:aufever_at_hotmail_dot_com&quot;&gt;aufever_at_hotmail_dot_com&lt;/A&gt;). he
is absolutely mr bus. if you need it he has it. also met mike g. another super
nice guy, a pleasure to be with.  and last but not least is david schwarze
(des_at_tiu_dot_net). mr gauge.  this man is an engine wiz.  and hes right. use
synthetic oil, and you cant have enough gauges.  traveling with this man is
great. he keeps an eye on your car for you, maps out the route to take, and
makes great breakfast. i miss this guy and look forward to meeting up with him
at buses on the blue ridge next year.   some names that i met ive forgotten so
if I met you please drop me a line and say hi.  and if you were at circle your
wagons 8 in sevierville, tn   that was me with the generator on the roof
playing the hammond organ in the back while the wife was driving around the
show.

hope i didnt bore anyone, i tend to go on a bit, 

cheers
