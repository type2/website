Subject: Re: [T2]  painting a bus/front beam

&quot;The knooks and crannies are clean and zero rust (ZR) may not be well known 
but
it will put a very good layer down for rust prevention, the stuff was 
designed&quot;

Any idea if something like this could be used 'inside' a new front beam to 
prevent rust from forming internally(which is, as I understand it where most 
beam-rot starts)?
