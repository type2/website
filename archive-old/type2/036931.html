As some know, when I bought my 71 camper I didn't have a running engine. It's 
been almost a year of me working on the body and I'm almost done. A few more 
days and a new welded battery tray and it's gone to look about as good as it 
is going too until I get some cash together for a new paint job. 
Anyway, so it was time to tackle the engine. Last fall Sean from the list was 
kind enough to come and help me take the engine out of the bus. Yesterday 
another friend and I took it apart to see if we could find the problem and 
get it ready for a rebuild. He has done literally hundreds of these engines, 
so I feel I'm in good hands. Anyway, seems the PO blew a valve. Pretty bad 
too. So I'm in need of a new head, and will replace both of them. 
Anyone know where I can purchase these for a decent price? I'll take rebuilt 
ones. 
I have a list of things to get...but the others aren't going to hurt my 
checkbook as much!
I'm getting totally excited that my camper will be on the road this 
spring...happy days ahead!!
