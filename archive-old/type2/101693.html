&gt;&gt;This March I will travel from New York to Mexico to collect interviews.
I hope to fit some VW rallies into the schedule to meet people&lt;&lt;

Sean,

i don't know your planned route, but FullMoonBusClub sponsors an event
in Columbia, SC every year called 'Paddy's Wagens'. (shameless plug)

sounds like a perfect opportunity to collect data for your project.

usually at our campouts there is some type of repair/wrenching going on,
and occassionally an A.I.R.S. rescue (AMHIK).

i am hoping to have my new-to-me '77 Riviera by then &amp; i'm sure there
will be some fine tuning going on with that.

good luck,

Joel Wilson
