&gt;I know some people really prefer to use the rubber fuel lines. Although I don't see what benefit they have over the steel lines, I can think of many benefits the steel lines have over the rubber lines. I think most people who use the rubber lines probably just prefer to keep their car stock.

Besides being inexpensive, rubber is flexible and there is a lot of vibration going on. Even the FI buses with their steel lines have rubber sections all over.

The older beetles used a hard line from the fuel pump to the carb.

What I like about the steel lines is that there is less rubber in the system to replace. I find fuel line expensive at flaps so I use less expensive brake lines instead.
