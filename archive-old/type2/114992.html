&gt; Just wondering how long it is suppose to take for the idle to drop after
&gt; driving. I had problems with the warm idle not dropping and tracked it down to
&gt; one of the vacuum hoses on the decel valve. Now the idle drops down to 900rpm
&gt; where I have it set and timed at 7.5 btdc, but sometimes it takes almost a
&gt; full minute or a little longer. Is this normal?

Sounds ok.

&gt; Sometimes it takes longer after a long highway run.

That doesn't sound right.

After you start the engine, the aux. air regulator is going to raise the
idle for about that length of time. A faulty decel valve or hose to it as
you found out will raise the idle.

As the engine warms the temperature sensor in the head behind #4 cylinder
will causes the ECU to adjust the mixture as the block warms.

The idle only gets super rock solid and purrs when the nominal engine
temperature is reached and all the sensors are in the &quot;zone&quot; all everything
mechanical is in proper working order.

&gt; I guess it could be a good thing to help the engine
&gt; cool after a long drive then going into stop and go driving. What do you
&gt; guys/gals think? Oh, its a 78 Westy.

The issue is called hot soak: run up the engine temperatures then turn off
the engine and the temps start to climb a bit after due to lack of cooling.

Unless the oil pressure alarms go off, in hot weather you should lower your
speed for 5 minutes or so before coming to a stop and turning off the
engine. It matters less out here on the coast where it's still in the
sixties and the fan shroud doesn't even get warm.

Folks who race on the track, warm up their engines before racing and do a
few cool down laps afterwards. It's a good practice for everyone.
