Subject: Re: [T2] Head removal on type 4 2000cc

One guy can't do one side, another can't do the other.
Kinda proves my point. Both sides are doable.
It takes a natural affinity and some dexterity
to remove cylinder heads with the engine installed.
I have no problem with the procedure.
It's much faster than a drop (for me).
Piston pins will remove toward the center.

&gt; &gt;it really is more trouble than it is worth, the 3/4 side isn't too bad

&gt; &gt;the 1/2 side is much much harder, because the alt is in the way
&gt;
&gt; I hafta disagree with you Bob.  The 3/4 side is harder because of the oil
cooler mount.  The alternator is removeable, the oil cooler mount is not.
You might respond that it doesn't make much difference for pulling the
cyliner head, which is true.  But if you pull the head and then find that
the piston needs to be changed too, you will be in a pickle because on the
3/4 side the oil cooler mount prevents you from removing the piston pin from
the rear and the bellhousing prevents removal from the front.  I had this
problem back in 1988 and ended up notching my bellhousing for clearance to
get the pin out (the bellhousing was already damaged anyway) but I wouldn't
want to have to do it again.
&gt;
&gt; Bottom line - it can be done in a pinch, but unless there was no practical
way to do it I would drop the engine for this repair.
