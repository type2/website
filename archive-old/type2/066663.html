Subject: Cams &amp; Valves 

 Notice the title? I'm bucking for &quot;Archive&quot; here babe.

 While you fashion hounds were debating the &quot;political correctness&quot;
of &quot;Orange Stool&quot; and measuring your curtains, I was studiously 
reading a book called &quot; Basic Cams, Valves &amp; Exhaust Systems&quot;.

 Hydraulic vs Solid Lifter Cams: They don't want to talk about it.

The most I could gather is that the Solid has a brief flat spot before
&quot;ramping&quot; again. It seems to need this to &quot;catch up with itself&quot;,
then the word &quot;Valve-Lash&quot;. You don't want to know.

 On the Hydraulic lifter, having its self-correcting &quot;zero back-lash&quot;,
it can start to &quot;ramp&quot; at once. So they do.

 If this is all there is to it, then it sounds like you could use
hydraulic lifters on a &quot;solid&quot; cam but not the other way around.

 &quot;You first&quot;. :-)

 The book was published in &quot;74, talks about how you just go tell your
&quot;Cam-grinder&quot; what your tire diameter and final gearing was and he'd
grind to put your max torque there.

 I wish I had lived in those days.

 Valve clearance: The .004&quot; to .006&quot; to the .006&quot;in/.008&quot;exh.

 First, it was determined by VW that the max expansion of all &quot;the
goodies&quot; worked out to .004&quot; at standard operating temperatures.

 The intake valve is always being cooled by incoming fuel/air.

 The exhaust on the other hand is always being &quot;heated&quot; by gasses as high as
1600 degrees. 
 It may attain temperatures of 1300-1400 degrees at the tulip/stem.
 This old book talks about the new-fangled &quot;stainless valves&quot;.

 It seems they have a 40% greater &quot;expansion rate&quot; than the old &quot;steel&quot;
valves. Remember the &quot;leaded gas&quot;?

 Forty perecent of .004&quot; is 1.6 mil round to two. Ergo the .006.

 Experience probably got them to go to .008&quot; on the exhaust in the
bigger engines, ie the type 4.

 This also might apply to those running &quot;big bore&quot; or even &quot;California
Lean&quot; type 1's. 

 The only way I can think of to get the real &quot;skinny&quot; on your own
engine would be a &quot;hot compression test&quot;.

 &quot;You first&quot;.  :-)

 There is more, if you run solid lifters &quot;sloppy&quot; you'll increase
your &quot;low end&quot; torque. Always with the sacrifice to your &quot;high end&quot;.

 The reverse is also true. Meaning running &quot;tight&quot; will increase 
&quot;high end&quot; with a sacrifice in &quot;low end&quot;.

 In closing I'd like to say I hope this &quot;technical stuff&quot; bugs you
&quot;Interior Decorators&quot; as much as your damned Curtains bug me.  :-)
