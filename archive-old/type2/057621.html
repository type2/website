Subject: engine info

Can someone recommend a manual that shows the Type 4 engine in photos
and/or drawings? I have Bentley for my 78 van but it doesn't have much
specific for the pancake. I am a visual learner. I would appreciate any
suggestions.
	What kind of logical carb choices do I have if I want to remove the
fuel injection?
Thanks, Gary
