Subject: No Collector Insurance on Westies??
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I'm trying to obtain collector insurance for my 77 Westy. I was just rejected 
by American Collectors Insurance because they don't cover campers. Can anyone 
recommend a collector insurance company that does cover campers? I neec 
collector insurance to avoid emissions inspection. Thanks.
