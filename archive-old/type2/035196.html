Subject: 70 bus just aquired

I have just recently bought a bus from a towing company for 50$ when I
looked at it did not run and it had a couple of holes in the floor. Before I
brought it home I cleaned the carb and got it running. I drove it part way
home and the bus would not move any farther the clutch had been burnt right
out. so I towed it the rest of the way thanks to CAA. Now I have it home but
I do not have an ownership for it yet. will have soon I have now bought a
camper top for it and I plan on making it into a westfalia with all recycled
parts. the engine is now out of it and I plan on rebuilding the engine but
have little experience in doing this.  But I have helped my father rebuild
tractor motors and I believe that this won't be any harder.

I am new to the whole VW world I have had beetles but never had them on the
road.  I had a 67 split window westy but my brother decided it was an
eyesore so he sold it while I was in college.  but now I have a 1970 bay
window and have lots of plans for it.  I trying to think of a name for her?
but it just hasn't hit me yet.

The engine is very dirty lots of grime but it is relatively easy to come a
part none of the bolts broke or were seized.

I have the Haynes book and muir but find that things aren't as explained as
I would like them. Could some one suggest some book that is better or even
their own advice would be great.

so far I have spent about 600$ Canadian on parts but that is on parts to
make it into a westy.
I am also looking to get a front emblem front my bus.
Any suggestion please write me

Paul
