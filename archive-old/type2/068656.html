Subject: Re: What the heck is this engine?!

the engine timing does not relate to piston/cylinder size, but the something
in the way the bottom end is made.  i dont know why. it changes though - i
just time it where it runs and sounds best.

you can make a 1500  a dual port or a 1600 a single port.    im dont know how
to visually tell a 1500 from a 1600 except by measuring the cylinder size,
which means pulling to partway apart.

i prefer the mechanical advance distributors.   i run a 019 in Bugster, and
will put one in the patchwork bus (65 camper)  (im trying out names).   they
are better than the 009, but, as they say, NLA.

&gt; So I'm trying to figure out what the timing for the Westy should be, and
&gt; I check the engine number. Guess what? My engine's number is &quot;H&quot;. Just
&gt; H, nothing following. Muir gives &quot;H&quot; numbers for 1500 engines, circa
&gt; 1967... So what do I have here - a rebuilt case from a 1500? Is that why
&gt; the thing is working so danged hard? Man, I feel like an idjut, but why
&gt; the heck would you put a 1500 in a '71 bus?!
&gt;- - - 
H means it was originally a 1500.    no number means it was rebuildt and the
number ground off.   the power difference is not much compared to a 1600.
   it could be a 1600, actually.    i wouldn't worry about it, if it runs
good, dont bother.    someone prolly  just replaced the old motor when it
died.  if it has a single tube  (cross section round) into the head each
side, a SP,   a 'dual' tube (cross section kinda like an 8) , a DP.
