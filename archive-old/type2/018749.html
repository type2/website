I had the same problem with my Saab 99...I quickly learned to always park at
the top of a hill.

Just a bonehead guess here, but it sounds like it might be a vapor-lock
problem. I've heard, but never actually tried, that putting wooden clothes
pins on the fuel line will diffuse the heat &amp; keep the gas from vaporizing in
the lines.

Sorry I couldn't be of more help--maybe this will prompt a better response
&gt;from a more lucid list member.
