Subject: Re: [T2] Brake question

&gt; Maybe the rear brake cylinder part number is also related to whether
&gt; you've got discs (mine does) up front or drums?? Maybe vacuum assist was
&gt; only included on busses with type 4 engines??? Any other Euro bussers
&gt; out there?

Youve got front discs but no servo? interesting.
