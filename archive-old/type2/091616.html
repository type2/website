I have seen  others but not the overboard like the vw nazis.  Porche,  
mercedes,  and bmw  just to name a few are very picky if you start 
displaying their emblems without permission.   They are however easier 
to talk to  if you are hobbiest and not commercial.   Ref the coffe 
cups caper.  dont do that with their emblems  either.  Porche went 
after a company that sold a whole six custom  made seat covers about  
two years ago.  they had a porche logo  on them.  mercedes was in the 
news a while back because a  keychain  company  was making key chains 
without a license.  a  garage  here  in town that i do  a  lot of stuff 
with does  not have a single vehicle  logo on its building even though 
they specialize in german metal.  They cant because to put up a sign is 
to signify that corporations support of our shop or to make  people 
think you are &quot;official&quot;.

&gt; Anybody know if VW is the only one acting this protective of its

&gt; cars use the name with apparent impunity...Obsolete Ford, for ex-
