Subject: an aftermarket ragtop

Hey everybody, 
has anyone ever instaled an aftermarket ragtop in a bus?
i talked to one guy from &quot;Sunroof Performers&quot; from an ad in vw trends, and he
said $369 for a kit.  it's only 35x40, and i'm not sure if it's worth it.
 just lookin' for advice
ttfn
jake v.
78 bus
