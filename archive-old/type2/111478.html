Subject: power drain

good morning everyone. i need some advice/direction here.

i currently have a problem that is eating my battery power in my
69 Single Cab.  i put a new battery in last week &amp; it fired right
up. also, i tested it with the engine running &amp; it was showing
about 14 volts, so i understand that while the engine is running
it is charging the battery.  i obviously have some sort of
gremlin that is running all the time &amp; draining the battery.

i'm going to start with disconnecting any aftermarkey stereo
systems that are currently in the vehicle &amp; see if that 
solves the problem.

if it doesn't, i need to know where to start looking around.

i do have a VOM, although i am a beginner at using it, so please
keep any hints/tips/procedures in 'laymans terms'.

i have also been browsing the Muir book on this topic, but plan on
a more detailed reading this evening.

thanks in advance,
