Subject: 77 auto accel cable

The guy (Marcus Blankenship)was asking for an accel cable for a 77 auto - so
the busdepot link is for the right part.

If RMMW has it, Ron can get it and he can beat the price in the book.

Marc: ask busdepot about part number 211-723-555 sales_at_busdepot_dot_com
You can order online right now using your checking account- you don't need a
credit card.

&gt; 
&gt; that part number  211-723-555 is correct for the AUTOMATIC only 76+
&gt; the manual transmission accel part number is 211-723-555AA, the manual
&gt; tranny cable is 3458mm long, while the auto tranny cable is 2870mm long.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I have not checked with Ron, lately, before he was unable to get em, RMMW
&gt; now has em listed but at $21.95  while the manual tranny cable is $5.95
