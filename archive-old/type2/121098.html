Subject: Corvair engines and complete cars

Just a heads up for those of you that are into Corvair conversions for buses
or whatever. A fellow in town here has 4 complete corvairs sitting in his
back yard that are in themselves fairly restoreable, but at the least have
engines for those of you that like to ruin our gorgeous Bays etc etc. ;-) 
If you're interested email me and I'll pass along the info. I'm in Nanaimo,
BC on Vancouver Island. Yes, yes I know, it's tough to live in God's country
but I suffer silently. :-P
