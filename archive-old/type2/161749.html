Subject: RE: [T2] Maui

You can rent a Vanagon on either Maui or the Big Island.

http://www.gb-adventures_dot_com/

Although I doubt you could get one just for a day. Maybe some Hawaii list
members will speak up.

I'll be on the Big Island for 8 days in March touring in a Vanagon camper.

&gt; Do we have any list members in Maui? I am making a trip in May, and thought&gt;
perhaps it would be fun to meet you.. any maybe rent your bus for a day??
