Subject: 79' Westy Wiper Questions

My wipers start out at a very slow moving pace and gradually increase to, 
what I can only imagine is, the target wiping speed. The colder it is, the 
longer it takes em' to get going. Why? My Bentley manual that came with the 
bus has pages torn out and I think the page I need is one of the page(s) 
that is missing. Thanks in advance for the help/advice.
