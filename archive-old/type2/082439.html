Subject: RE: [T2] new job, 50 MILE commute to work, NEED/gages

&gt; ALL auto gages are inaccurate at best.  what you need
&gt; is to figure out where your vw operates and mark those
&gt; locations in your head then when they differ from what
&gt; the base reading is then you will want to figure out
&gt; why.  if your temp has gone up by say 10F and all

Just a quick tip: in racing, many folks orient their gauges so that
the dial is pointing straight up (vertical) when operating at
normal temp, pressure etc., so they don't have to worry with
remembering the correct readings.

I don't have non-stock gauges in my VWs (yet)
so I don't know what kind of dancing around they do, so this may
not be too practical.
