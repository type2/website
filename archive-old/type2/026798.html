Subject: On eliminating an unnecessary noise in the front cab

Well I finally got up the courage to do the equivalent of tearing off the 
&quot;DO NOT REMOVE UNDER PENALTY OF LAW&quot; mattress tag from my '75 van. I 
disabled the idiotic egr warning lamp actuator positioned on the speedometer 
cable. This gear driven contraption turns on the EGR warning light every 
15,000 miles to &quot;remind&quot; you to go to the dealership to have the EGR valve 
checked. Because the EGR is still being checked every two years at the state 
smog test, I don't think my action will result in any unnecessary pollution 
of the Golden State.
Rather than just pull the electric plug or the whole box, however, I pulled 
two gears out of the inside mechanism. The box is still needed because it is 
an integral part of the speedometer cable; you can't remove the whole box 
unless you want to put in a new cable. The reason for pulling out the gears 
was that by so-doing I got rid of an annoying source of &quot;subliminable&quot; (with 
acknowledgements to &quot;Shrub&quot; Bush) noise.
Like the rest of us, owning a Van is a very aural experience, and the 
grinding of those gears was a real distraction when I am trying to enjoy the 
tappet rhythms wafting satisfyingly from the engine compartment. So if you 
want to greatly improve the 'fidelity' of the sound in your mid-70's type 2, 
and remove a disturbing grinding sound that sub-consciously causes anxiety, 
just get in there and pull the gears from that idiot box.
