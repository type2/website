Subject: Re: Information from the list/ table hinge

My 'experience' shows that not all Westfalia interiors are the same.
By the way, my rear table composes 2 halves, joined by 2 flush mounted
hinges, the 2 halves opening out flat with a metal support bracket sliding
out from one to support the other.
(The whole then fits on an upright which slides through a circular support
screwed to one side and it then locates on a fitting on the floor).
The hinges are real cabinet makers style, the 3 screws in each half of each
hinge are not the same.
The hinges are rounded at the ends and sunk flush with the top of the table.
Long winded eh ? If you have got to here and understand it then you will
have seen a table like mine !
A picture is worth a thousand words but I fail to get my web site running.
I need one good hinge.
Thanks for trying John Perry
