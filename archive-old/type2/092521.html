&gt;Friends: I'd appreciate some advice on how to reduce HC at high rpm

Wrong, put in Bosch Supers. This could well be the problem.

&gt;  (This might be defined as a 'miss', I guess).

Bosch Supers. Don't waste money on platinums.

&gt;  I recently replaced the pushrod tube seals, and after reassembly of the 
&gt; rockers, reset the valves (.006); but then again I'm not sure that one of 
&gt; them might not be a bit off.*

Make sure!!

&gt;Would a valve gap being 'off' cause the increased noise/ decrease in rpm/ 
&gt;excess HC at 2500+ rpms, or is there another possibility to investigate?
&gt;Two years ago it passed smog with some to spare. The engine is totally 
&gt;stock with about 85k miles on it and is otherwise running smoothly and 
&gt;with good power and economy.

Verify compression.
