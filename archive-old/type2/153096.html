Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Stranded ... Bus won't run. --&gt; Fixed?

&gt; What kind of ignition was it?  Regular coil or high-output?

I'm not sure what brand it was or anything.  It hooked up to the coil
with two wires, one positive and one negative, and it was a small
black box that fit inside the distributor where the points were.  I
could look at it for a brand name or mark or something and let you
know.  Pmail me for that.  I had a regular blue bosch coil.

&gt;I guess you just have to keep a good
&gt; (complete) set of points around just in case, huh?

I think that's what I'll do from now on!

Peace,
 - Ian
