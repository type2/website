&gt; Right side is the passenger side. The left and right cables work off
&gt; of the same lever as I recall (on the dash).

Do you know which cable goes to the passenger heater box and which cable 
goes to the driver's heater box?  One cable has a bend it in, and the 
other has a loop.  Also, which lever do they work off of (right or left)?

  &gt; There is another cable that opens and closes the front floor vents.
&gt; That is the flapper determines how much heat (there's that term
&gt; again!) goes to the windshield and how much goes to the floor. It is

Do you know what lever that hooks up to?

&gt; Lastly - and this is another one I need - there is a cable that goes
&gt; to a flapper box located in the first crossmember behind the front

Does that cable hook up to the same lever as the one above?

thanks,
Mike
