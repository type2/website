Try http://www.partsplaceforallvws_dot_com/.  If they don't have it new they do 
have it used.

&gt; &gt;I recently looked for one of these, and so far I have
&gt; &gt;heard that they are not available, go to a junkyard,
&gt; &gt;and that they are &quot;obsolete&quot;.  So how does one go
&gt; &gt;about geting them?  Am I not looking in the right
&gt; &gt;places?  I'm looking for new, but a good shape used
&gt; &gt;one I could clean up would work.  If there is anywhere
&gt; &gt;I could look which I haven't, please let me know.
&gt; &gt;Thanks
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Blake
