Mine are single strand. The heater cable wire is heavier than the air
control cable wire but the outside sleeve is thinner, go figure.

Glad you said something though, one of my cables is bent to s***.

----------&gt;
&gt;Asked this one already but no response so far. Can one of you who's got
&gt;original heater cables take a look under and describe them to me.
&gt;
&gt;Are they multistrand wires or single strand? Even if you don't know if
&gt;they're original a poll of several vans may help me to decide.
