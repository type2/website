Subject: Trip Rpt: KC to Moab, UT

Hi all,

Just back from a 9-day trip out west.  Here's the VW Van report:

Mancos, CO:  An incredible butchery job on an early 60's Single Cab.
It now rests on a 4x4 truck chassis with many cuts in the body.  This one
is bound for the 'Bus Hall of Shame'!  I have a pic of the montrosity.
It sits at Gary's Auto Repair by the main highway.

Moab, UT: Buses, buses everywhere!  Lin Ottinger's Rock Shop has 'one' of
his splittie sunroofs on display.  The rest are hidden behind a fence and
not viewable by anyone in no uncertain terms.  I saw one 67 Westy
downtown -and- a tan Vanagon Synchro Panel -and- a white 84 Single Cab
from Ontario, Canada with a wild looking camper gizmo in the back--very
strange. I have a pic of the single cab.  Any scanning volunteers out
there?

The rest of the mobile VW Vans goes as follows:  about 3 dozen bubble
windows spotted, 4 dozen Vanagons, and a dozen Eurovan campers.  There was 
only one splittie I saw on the road...
