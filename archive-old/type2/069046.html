Subject: leaking rear wheel.. 67 westy

Hi All,
  The last couple of days I noticed a slight thumping (occasionally) while
driving around 40-45 mph.. Tonight while leaving work I noticed a wet  spot
on the outside of the rear tire. it was oil... and as I drove home it the
thumping noise occurred at greater intervals....

I looked at the Bentley Manual and I see there is a rear oil seal.. what
can I do to determine what to replace (besides the oil seal) and what if
any damage may I have done?

TIA

Tim
