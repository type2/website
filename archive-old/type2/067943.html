My fantasy bus...

This would be based on a Kombi loaf...

1.  No rust (biggest fantasy of all).
2.  Prefect condition 2.0L FI Type 4 engine
3.  Stainless steel exhaust muffler and heat exchangers
4.  Factory fitted high top with the extra high sliding door (It's in the parts
    book).
5.  Comfortable driving/passenger seats.
6.  Good heater
7.  Right hand drive (for UK)
8.  All loafs were made with LHD windscreen wipers but I want to convert to
    RHD wipers (I'm coggitating how to do this anyway).
9.  Transmission and running gear to be replaced with that from a Syncro 
    Vanagon.
10. Long range petrol tanks to give 1000 mile range.
11. Camper interior. Not too fussy as to what.
12. Heated and alarmed garage to keep it in, with pit, work-bench, and room to 
    swing a LARGE cat.

Is that asking too much????

Bob

PS Please don't show this to Primrose.
