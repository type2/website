Subject: [T2] Ron out today thru Sunday

I will be out of town for a few days (thru Sunday). It will be business as
usual at the shop, and email sent via the website or to sales_at_busdepot_dot_com
will continue to be answered while I'm gone. I will also be in regular
contact with the shop in case there are any issues that require my immediate
attention. However, I will not be checking email sent to my personal
addresses, busdepot_at_email_dot_com or ron_at_netcarrier_dot_com,   until I get back late
Sunday night.
Thank you,
