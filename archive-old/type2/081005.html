Subject: Part numbers for tools

Hi All!

I have been a lurker for several days now and have waited for Friday to =
post this question.  I'm looking at buying a big stash of tools from the =
estate of a deceased VW mechanic.  Most of the tools I don't recognize =
but they all have VW part numbers.  Can anyone point me to a source for =
a book or website that lists what these tools are?

Also, I'm putting the motor back in my 83 Westy (aircooled) and in the =
process of updating I would like to install a trickle charger on my =
battery.  Could anyone recommend some brands to me?
