Subject: [T2] '78 Hard starting and now it will not idle 

You guys are great, thanks for calming me down. I found the idle problem right away, the intake air hose to the Aux Air Regulator was about 3 inches aft of where it belonged. Can't really wrap my aging mind around why it caused the problem. In the morning I'll tackle the starting problem, then I can concentrate on the oil leaks and body work. Thanks again.
   
  Oh, the rubber elbow/plug on that air hose is torn, what's the chance of an available replacement.
