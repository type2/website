Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Cooler seal

&gt;Listees,
&gt;     How much of a problem is it to change the oil cooler seals with the
&gt;engine in? Will I save any time doing it this way as opposed to pulling the
&gt;engine?

Tim is right, before you suspect the seal, check the oil pressure switch, 
remove the flex seal and check for oil. If none, another leaker is the gasket of 
the oil filter neck, also, it could be the engine bore plug behind the fan housing 
or the oil cooler by itself. The oil pressure relief valve could also be a leaker. 
(he he he) A lot to look for! Spray some brake cleaner to remove most oil, 
drive the van and look again.

You CAN repare/replace those leak with the engine still in the bus but 
you will have to remove the fan shroud, it can be a pain in the ass if the heater box
are stuck, you will have to remove at least one heater box to remove the fan shroud.

But it is no so hard, i have many pictures of the precedure but they are not online yet
I can p-mail them to you if you want, for now, as a proof, look at my head removal 
with engine still in the van section.
