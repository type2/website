Subject: re: driver door on baywindow in charlotte area

Dear knowledgeable veedubites,

I am writing this for a friend that is not yet man-enough to join the type 2 
list. I am praying for him.

He is in need of a driver's side door on his 1978 westy...he got hit by a 
backHOE the driver of the backHOE was not paying attention (like most 
charlotte driverS!!!!!!!!!!!!!)

Anyone know of a spot that he can find a driver's side door for a really 
reasonable price (like free or a little bit more)

by the way, he was told that a 1968-69 door would fit his bus -- which the 
hinges are different and will not work that well -- he was told this by a 
very careless shop owner in the charlotte area --

anyway, please give us a bit of help

...

also we are going to be painting the bus after we get the door -- anyone 
know of a good reasonably priced painter in the area...

tj
