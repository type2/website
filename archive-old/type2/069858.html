Subject: 81 airtight but still hot

Phooey! With my new seals and all I thought I had this heat thing licked but
I was proved wrong. I now think that the only thing that really matters is
how cool the outside air is . Sub 80* and I think I can do anything with the
oil temp in the 210* to 220* range. Above that and it's only a matter of time
til I end up in the neighborhood of 250* again.

What really gets me is that the harder the motor works, the cooler it gets. I
assume that's a function of higher air flow at higher rpms. On the other
hand, the worst situation is simply loafing down the road. It actually runs
cooler on a hilly road than on a nice flat one apparently since the motor has
to work now and again What kind of through the looking glass scenario is
that?
