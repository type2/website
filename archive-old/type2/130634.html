Subject: tranny for sale

I have a late (78) bus tranny and an earlier one for sale. I live in Buffalo 
NY and will be driving to Herndon Virginia this weekend if someone around 
there wants it. Make a reasonable offer, I know the late 78 is more in demand due 
to better gearing for highway. Also have a 1700 block good shape, and a 2000 
needs rebuild but looks fine otherwise. Dylan.   can call if you like 716 741 
1245
