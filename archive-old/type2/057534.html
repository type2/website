Subject: Hunting Vacuum Leaks('76)Suggestions?

Hello to all.  My last posting in July had me sorting out the coil
wires which I had mislabled while replacing a cyclinder head.  Thanks
to Mike Benthin, Sean Bartnik, Karl Von Salzen, Marek and others I got
that sorted out, though my points were really fried.  
Since then I've been trying to find the time to locate a massive
vacuum leak  in the FI system.  After reading   the archives, I
understand that I need to check all of the hoses, (inspecting and/or
removing and plugging the circuits) and check injector seals, oil
filler, crankcase breather, etc.  Finally, I should use either
propane, low pressure or vacuum pump to locate the leak.

I've trimmed the frayed edges off of all of the smaller hoses and
clamped them back on with hose clamps.  I replaced the crankcase
breather hose with US heater hose and clamps.  I replaced the S tube,
the 4 intake manifold connecting hoses and all injector seals.  During
this process the leak got better and then got worse and now with the
idle screw all the way out I get no idle. 

I tried using propane through a torch tip but I could not locate it. 
The leak sounds massive, making a high pitched whine.  Trouble is, I'm
deaf in one ear and can't pinpoint noises very well.  I'm now planning
on using low pressure from my air mattress foot pump and spraying
soapy water on the system to look for bubbles.    Someone once posted
that in order to pressurize or vacuum-ize a system that the rocker
arms needed to be backed off to seal all cylinders.  Any other
suggestions?  Anything I'm overlooking here?
