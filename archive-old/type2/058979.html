Subject: RE:  Fuel injected 1600

&gt;It seems that with all the frustration out there over the 34 PICT 3 
&gt;carbs someone would have tried to transplant a FI system from a
&gt;beetle or type 3.  I understand that the FI system on those engines 
&gt;is onlymeant for &quot;stock&quot; type engines.  That is it should be a 1600 
&gt;and not anything larger and it should run a stock cam and exhaust 
&gt;(probably, don't know).  How about it?  Is this a totaly lame idea?  

I think it's a great idea.  In fact, I was planning on going that route
for my 58 single cab until I got greedy (and probably stupid at the same
time) and decided to build a 1776 with a few extra goodies on it.  I may
still try the FI route after I get it running and all the bugs worked
out.

The same basic question applies to all those folks with 1.7 type IV
motors.  Why not get an FI system from a 1.7 914 and install it.  After
swapping my 2.0 914 from dual Webers back to FI I'm sold on the concept.
