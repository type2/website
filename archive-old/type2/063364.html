While going about my business today...in my Vanagon...I was waiting to pull out
from a side stree onto one of the major two lane avenues into town..  Saw a
fairly clean splitty with historic plates coming along and waved at him as he
went by.. Hey!  That classy guy waved back.   John Jensen in Annapolis.
