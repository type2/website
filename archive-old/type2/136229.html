Subject: Re: [T2] Where to wire Stereo power?

Mark,
Pretty simple.  Wire it into the fusebox.  Use a tester to find which terminals are hot and switched.  There are some extra spade terminals on some of the blocks.  Just be safe and careful in your selection.  i.e. not too many wires on one block.
