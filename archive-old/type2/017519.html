I've been idly on the lookout for one for some time (for the same reason).
Co-incidentally, I've just come across two. I hope nobody's listening...

The other day in my van, I spotted a load of illegally dumped rubbish. Staring
straight out at me it is a beetle exhaust. There's no-one around, so I stop for
a look, and there amongst it all is a type 1 engine (full of water)and a VW
transmission. Swiftly transfer it to the van and bugger off In case anyone
thinks it's me that's dumped the stuff (cue Arlo Guthrie song) - Bellhousing #1
(and aparrently a fully functional gearbox - transporter or 'super-beetle', I'm
not sure. Its got &quot;elephant tusks&quot; on the front, and a mounting eyes on the
bell-housing).

So now I need a spare starter. As (another) hobby, I explore the local limestone
caves &amp; mine-workings. One of which has a scrap 1969 or 1970 camper wedged
sideways half way down one of the shafts. Unfortunately, access to this mine
involves trespassing, so I had to sneak myself &amp; my tool-bag in, dodging from
tree to tree. Climb down through the body of the transporter, burrow through the
load of barbed wire that's been dumped since my last visit and find... no
starter ! - Bellhousing #2 (well, it seems a shame to break the gearbox). I then
try and walk nonchelantly down the road, looking like I'd been pulled through a
hedge backwards, and carrying half a gearbox. 

I don't suggest you attempt to copy the above acts, but things do turn up in the
most peculiar places. If all else fails you may have to buy(!) one from a
breaker.
