I'm having sporadic trouble with the 68, goes spontaneously dead sometimes,
seems to be a fuel delivery problem. I have been doggedly eliminating
variables for days but it only happens about once per day so diagnosis
takes a while. Tomorrow I'll rebuild the carb, if that doesn't work then
Friday I'll pull the tank and slosh it out. A chunk of crap in the tank
that occasionally floats its way into the oulet can cause the most
frustrating erratica as many of you know...

But we're still taking the 68 because that is the right way to do this.

Have you tried the gas tank magnet on a stick technique?   If there is
floating rusty type crud in there, it really helps  Sew broken chunk of
speaker magnet into bag made from part of old t shirt rag, attach to wire coat
hanger.     Put in gas tank and flod the edge of the end of the hanger over
the pipe.   gas cap will fit a little funny.   Check for chunks periodically.
Much easier than pullling the tank.

When I get back I shall post the most extensive and florid and masturbatory
of trip reports and those who object will be sent extra complimentary
copies.

I glad that Pandora has been found and will be given the care to revive her.
