Subject: Anyone on the list go to Small Country campout?

I am trying to find out if anyone on the list attends the Full Moon Bus Club
sponsored event at Small Country campground in Louisa, VA? I think this
event happened on September 19th. This is the closest event to me and I was
interested in knowing who else has buses that are close to me. Anybody on
this list? Hopefully I can attend my first bus campout next year at this
event.

Thanks,
Corbett
