David Schwarze scripted:

&gt; Doesn't that create a vacuum leak?  Air cleaner to intake manifold = vacuum
&gt; leak in my book since there is no significant vacuum inside the air cleaner.
&gt; 

That was my feeling too, but bus seemed to run fine with this setup.
(Runs fine without it now too, go figure).  I'm not expert on the
matter, but the two nipples on the carb-cleaner bridge connect to a
smallish bulge in said bridge, which might hide something like a one-way
vacuum valve in there.  OR, maybe the two nipples never even interact
with the air going through the bridge and are instead linked to each
other in a mysterious fashion through that bulge.  Like I said, I'm no
expert with this - that's just the way mine came when I bought it. 
Anyone?
	
	On a related note, when I replaced the stock elbow (the one with that
extra hose to bridge) with the regular L, the VW guru (and guru is the
right word... been working on those air suckers since 1954!) where I do
work on my van said: &quot;You need to have it smogged? No? Then get rid of
that thing.&quot; refering to the stock elbow.  Maybe there's a reason VW
discontinued making that part.

	Now can anyone tell me what that cookie I referred to in the original
post does and how vital it is to have it functioning?
