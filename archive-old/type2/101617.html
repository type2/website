Subject: Re: [T2] pushrod tube seals uh oh


&gt; So, maybe a seal is bad, or maybe one of them just isnt tight enough up
&gt; against the head, i dont know. Do I need to worry about the pushrod tubes
&gt; themselves, and what may happen if I put little dings in them when
&gt; installing/uninstalling?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for any tips, suggestions, or Tomfoolery...

Christopher-
You may need to use a metric wench for this job:)
Pushrod tubes may be straightened by using an increasing
size combination of ratchet socket / extension and
carefully tapping thru the tube ding from the inside.
Ask your mother what happens with used rubber sealing things.
