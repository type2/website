&gt;&gt; The 1600 stocker has a force pushing on the head of
&gt;&gt; 3,008 lbs!

&gt;Would you divide by {(head plus piston crown) plus (area of cylinder
&gt;exposed at whatever point we're measuring at)} ? Probably maximum psi is at
&gt;maximum expansion/minimum chamber volume, wherever that is.

Couldn't you say total possible engine force would be about 3,008lbs
assuming it was a single inline four cylander and all cylanders fired at the
same time?
Could we not adjust for a VW by saying, we have two heads... therefore
3,008/2=1504lbs
In any one head, only one piston will fire at one time thereby 1502/2=751lbs.
So in a a rough sense.. there is about 751 lbs pushing on the head at piston
TDC.
