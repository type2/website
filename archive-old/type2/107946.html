Subject: RE: [T2] shorts

A typical VOM can handle enough current to safely measure the memory
sustaining power to a clock or car stereo, or to detect a SMALL short with a
high resistance.  However, anything larger than that could fry a VOM that's
designed to measure 300 mA max. If you suspect a larger drain, be careful
with your meter, or buy one that's designed to measure different amounts of
current.

---When you remove the ground cable and then go to put
it back on... are you seeing a small spark jump? If so
then there is to much current being drawn. Is
everything turned off? If you have a aftermarket
radio/cd player it will draw current to keep the
memory active.. but very little..
  Spark or no spark you need to do what Karl wrote
(below).
If you arent familure with a VOM then you might want
to
