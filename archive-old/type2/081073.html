&gt; &gt; &gt; No, that pic [fig 5-2] is of the manual trans decel valve. The auto
trans
&gt; &gt; &gt; decel is a tall cylinder. The hose that goes to the valve from the big S
hose
&gt; &gt; &gt; is rubber with a small end on it. Not the large cloth covered hose.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Go here: http://www.bug-bits.freeserve.co_dot_uk/ramva/fiche/t201810.gif
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; #5 is the manual trans decel valve
&gt; &gt; &gt; #47 is the cloth covered hose
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; #4 is the auto trans decel valve
&gt; &gt; &gt; #45 is the rubber hose
&gt;
&gt; and currently I have #6 on there....????? curiouser and curiouser

That is correct for your auto trans bus. It should have part number 022 133
551C on it. The large disc style pictured in the Bentley is the manual trans
one, it ends with a B.
You should have a U shaped rubber hose between it and the big S with part
number 022 201 919C on it.

What is wrong with your valve?
