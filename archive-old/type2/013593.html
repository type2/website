Hello,

I had the interior of mine redone which included dying
the vynal on the seats and dash. In these areas it
worked well. I have found that this stuff does not
stick well to plastic trim and other plastic parts in
the interior. After a year, all of the dye on the
plastic trim had pealed off but what was on the vynal
was still intact.

I have learned one thing when using it. It absolutely
necessary to make sure that the vynal is extermely
clean. This is a must. It also helps to lightly go
over the vynal surface with alittle steel wool. This
gives the dye somthing to stick to.

Good luck on the VW interior!

&gt; 
&gt; Yup, done it and the results were suprisingly good. 
&gt; In my bus I have one 
&gt; black door panel and one tan one which I dyed black.
&gt;  I've forgotten which 
&gt; is which and I sure can't tell by looking.
