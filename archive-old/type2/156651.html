Subject: Re: [T2] door latches

Just for grins I thought I'd try spraying PB Blaster around the  trigger.  Problem solved.  That must have been what I did  last time because it fixed it then for over a year.  But next time  I'll take it off and do it right.  
  
  Sure would like to have that Vanagon of yours.  Too much for me right now, I'm afraid.  Thanks...KR

Sounds like the problem is in the handle... The pot-metal behind the  
chrome will get corroded and the trigger will freeze up.

Remove the handle, carefully pry the trigger loose from the back and  
then clean and lubricate it. That should work better for a couple of  
years. On occasion I have seen the trigger break at the pivot, so be  
careful when prying. There's also a spring behind the trigger -- if  
it's still there then try not to lose it.

Happy trails,
