Subject: One more question

I have had a lot of questions today..... I have a compression gauge at home
that I tried out the other day. My current bus seems to run fine, but I
thought since I was changing the plugs that I would check it out. I was not
able to get the threaded piece tight. The sheet metal blocked me from getting
a wrench in there and the tube on the end of the tool would not allow any
socket. I was getting 50 psi on some and 0 on the other, so I am guessing that
I am not getting it tight. I am trying to tighten it my just twisting the
rubber hose and turning. Not working.

Any adapters or tricks to get these to work? People always talk about getting
compression readings, so their has to be an easier way...

This is on a Type 4 engine.

Thanks,
Corbett
