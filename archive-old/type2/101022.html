Subject: Re: [T2] Happy VW new year and thanks

well as the old year fades into history and a new one all bright and
shinny (and hopefully not from GEX) arrives I just want to take a quick
moment to thank all the good folks on this list who have provided so much
help and &quot;inspiration&quot; to keep these old buses on the road.  my 78 still
motors along in good part to the help from the list and the many members,
  so if I know you by face or only by e-mail....have a great new year and
safe busing
