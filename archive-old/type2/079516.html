Subject: Re: [T2] Heating with water - seeking what-if-ideas

George, Bob:
Gravity isn't that great for hydronic home heating systems either. Adding a
circulator pump will probably more than pay back the first year.
Home systems pumps handle the hot water fine, but are all 120 volts AC, so need
to look for boat stuff.
I really like the water (anti-freeze, of course) based system a lot better than
the oil.
any leaks could have fatal (to your engine) consequences.
There was some report of a similar system on this list 2 or 3 years ago.
