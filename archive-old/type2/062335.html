Subject: cleaning up oil on garage floor

What should I use to clean up the garage floor (cement). I have dripped
a lot of oil on it and we cleaned out the transmission bell housing
onto the floor too. :p I forgot to put down some newspapers...
Preferably there is something environmentally friendly that I can use.
Any ideas?

Mark
