Hi all,

When on the phone with AVP the very knowledgable woman I talked to brought
up the fact that Bentley suggests setting valves in 2.5 turns past zero
clearance.  She said that this is incorrect and the Bentley people are now
reccomending 1 turn past zero clearance.  However i guess no one knows
this as the bentley folks aren't gonna publish a new manual every time
they change their mind.  I adjusted my valves to 1 turn and my bus is
running smoother than ever.  Just thought I would share this info and ask
for peoples opinion on this idea.
