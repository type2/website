Subject: Which wire I need to take to power  my ACC cd player 

Hi,
I'd like to power  my cd  player but  is anyone could advise me about  
how to connect (or take the wire from ) the ACC (accessories) wire , 
this one should be on  with the ignition on
The position  7 (accessories)  in my fuse box is unused,  can I make a 
good use  of it  for let say .... use accessories  like  gauge and cd 
player ?, how ?
I manage to read  the R. Bentley Current flow  diagram (p97.14), so 
could you please tell me which  wires I can use accccording to this manual ?

Thanks a lot guys
