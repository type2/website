Subject: Re: [T2] What is this??? anyone know?

I sure could use a pair of these brackets if anyone has any available!  Greg
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Dave, if you haven't gotten any replies, those sure look like the brackets
that
&gt;mount to the engine block, between the Carbs, to hold the Air Filter
assembly. 
&gt;They look like the ones that I had on my '73, with 1700 engine.  That was a
&gt;paper filter Air Filter.  Hope this helps.
