Mike is right, the tin is very different and there is a slight difference
in the mount.  The mount difference is hte easiest.  Vanagon blocks are
tapped for M10 bolts, Bay cases are tapped for M8 bolts (or is that M12
and M10?) anyway, the bolts are bigger on the Vanagon cases...  You can
drill out the bay mount to accept the larger Vanagon bolts or put an
insert into the Vanagon case to accept the smaller Bay bolts.

Other differences are:

The fan shroud and alternator must be bay era. The vanagon shroud and alt
will not work with the bay tin.

The heads/heater boxes. Vanagon will be square exhaust port, and the
vanagon heater boxes do not have a connection to the fan shroud for heat.
I don't know what the solution for this is.  swap on oval port heads or
find '79 heater boxes.  I swapped on oval port heads.

If I understand Ron (Bus Depot) correctly, you can bolt oval port heater
boxes to the square port heads, but I have never tried this and am dubious
about doing it.

Dipstick -- My '73 has a vanagon block it it (which is how I know this
stuff :-).  And it has both dipsticks.  The bay dipstick comes in at the
oil fill tube that bolts to the block.  Use the bay oil fill tube and you
have the bay dipstick. The hole on the top of the block for the V'gon
dipstick must be stopped, and the vanagon dipstick tube is the ideal
stopper.  If you prefer the dipstick oil temp sender... this is ideal :-)
