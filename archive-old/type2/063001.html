&gt;Hey now
&gt;
&gt;I'm hoping that this is some useful information to some folks out
&gt;there.  Last weekend, I installed a starter relay in Samiam (77 Westy)
&gt;to remedy the won't-start-when-hot problem I encountered on my
&gt;trip to Canada the previous weekend.

&gt;Went to Woodstock yesterday for the Woodstock VW Reunion 3, and when
&gt;I got there after a 2-hour trip, Samiam started right up!  No more
&gt;sticking solenoid!

Well done !!  I wish I had done that on my 76.  I didn't have my Idiot book yet and due to my 
inexperience I just replaced it for $150 (ouch!) without knowing otherwise.  Although I am wiser 
now, I am glad that the darn thing actually starts after driving for more than 5 minutes.  Every 
time I stopped or turned off the ignition, I'd have to climb out and get behind the wheel with a 
long hammer and bang the stupid starter.  The paint was all worn off the outside of the solenoid  
from being hit so many times.  I must have had a lot of bad karma for a while, because the van 
always seemed to stall in the worst places, like at a stop light during rush hour down town or at 
a drive thru window. I'd get out there with my big hammer with everyone honking and glaring at 
me.  It even happened on a road trip when I was crossing a bridge over the Peace River, I had to 
stop after cruising _at_ 65MPH for about 3 hours for some construction.  Well, too bad I didn't 
have 3 feet to keep the engine going while braking and downshifting.  I ended up sitting on that 
stupid bridge letting my engine cool down. No amount of pounding would get the starter to click.  
BTW, what's the exact procedure for push starting?  I've never been able to do it properly.  
Anyway, that's my little story, glad it doesn't happen anymore.  Thanks for letting me share it.
