List, Perry

I'd be quite keen too to know of any techniques for floor covering. How are
modern conversions done?

My floor has carpet underlay (unavoidably its foam) and then 12mm MDF on
top. I had to make 3 pieces, and the gaps move slightly. The worry of
liquids getting underneath there is a concern too.

&gt; ............do you think i even need to put anything down underneath
&gt; the carpet and padding [yeah, i know - the padding is a sponge, too] or
are
&gt; the ridges in the floor going to feel weird if i don't have something
&gt; smooth on them?
