Subject: Re: [T2] fuel sender/gauge?

I would guess the qauge itself is pretty bulletproof, unless it got wet.
Since it works by varying voltage, a corroded or loose connection could
cause the wrong voltage to reach it.  Try checking the electrical
connections to the qauge itself and the ground wire to the instrument
cluster.  You might be able to do this by crawling under the dash, but it
would be easier to remove the steering wheel and pull the instrument cluster
forward and down so you can look at all the wires on the back.  Check 'em
all while you're there.

You might also look at the wires and ground connection for the tank sender,
if you can still access it easily (actually, your mechanic should have
looked at these).  Those connections were pretty crappy when I checked mine
a couple weeks ago.  They are right there by the sender.  It's easy to
access on my bus because a PO had used a cold chisel to cut a home-made
&quot;access panel&quot; into the engine deck above the sender.  This has actually
come in handy, and is normally well sealed with duct tape.
