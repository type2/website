Subject: [T2] list down?

I didn't get a digest this morning and also received an email from egroups 
saying that they were getting my mail returned to them, but If I received 
this message that the problem was fixed.

I still haven't received any digests though.  Is the list run through 
egroups?  i've never heard of that before.

Is everyone else getting theirs ok.  i'm receiving all other emails at the 
same address.
