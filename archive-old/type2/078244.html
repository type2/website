Subject: Re: [T2] rear hatch window installation

Joel its very funny, but I too installed the rear glass on my back hatch
this weekend. I got mine from Bus Depot too.

I found it easier to start at the bottom and work the sides and then up. I
used palmolive this time, but gojo hand cleaner works best. You know the
kind that smell funky, but not with gritty stuff in it. Coat the inside of
the seal and the rope (cloth). Go slow with someone helping. We found it
easier to push and pull the window til the lip of the seal cooperates. It
was tough to pull the string out in a couple of places, but it agreed with
some patience. Never go any farther if the seal isn't on right. Fix it with
a hook tool or screwdriver and then go on. It was kind of tough for us too.

Here is a link to mine:

Good luck!

&gt; Joel:
&gt;
&gt; For the rear hatch glass, you definitely need someone on the outside
pushing the glass in.  The front windshield can be installed solo, but the
rear hatch glass is inset from the surface of the hatch.  As for whether to
start from the bottom or top, it doesn't really matter, as long as your
pushing partner keeps even pressure on the glass.

&gt;  of course i am using the standard &quot;wire in the outer groove&quot; trick
&gt; &gt;with a little soap for lube.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;for those that have replaced this seal, would working for top-to-bottom
or
&gt; &gt;bottom-to-top be the best method? does that even matter?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;searched the archives on this &amp; didnt really learn anything specific
about
&gt; &gt;installing the rear window. the seal fits nicely around the glass, i just
&gt; &gt;can't figure out what i'm doing wrong on the installation.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;any tips or hints would really be great.  it's not supposed to rain here
&gt; &gt;again until Friday, so i figure i've got a couple more days to get the
&gt; &gt;window in.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;TIA.
