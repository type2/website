I'm real wary of a catalytic heater and the chemical byproducts 
spewing forth to the enclosed living area.  I've heard that they (or 
could I be referring to the white gas versions) emit Carbon Monoxide, 
which does us organic life forms harm (or death).  The instructions 
probably say to use in a well ventilated area.  I would hold back 
until other (non sales) information is obtained.

&gt; &quot;Catalytic heating is a no-waste form of heating since no heat is lost
&gt; through a flue or chimney. Flame type heaters waste up to 45% of all heat
&gt; produced. Catalytic heating is nearly 100% effecient, resulting in a more
&gt; effecient and low cost heat&quot;
