Subject: Wiring for 1971 poptop headlight switch

We just joined the Type2 and Vanagon lists about 2 weeks ago.  My 19
year daughter purchased the above mentioned bus and I am the proud owner
of a 1991 Vanagon. 

I've found the lists to be extremely informative, as I'm recently
returned to repairing my (our) VWs.  I've found the answers to several
small necessary repairs for the kid's bus.

Her headlights recently quit, but the parking lights still come on with
the switch.  I've got the switch out and there was a wire connected to
the switch that wasn't connected to anything at the other end.  This
wire plugs into the smallest post on the switch (labeled on the switch
body with 56b).  The other end of the wire has a spade type plug. Does
anyone know what the unattached wire is and where to attach it?  I feel
sure that the ground was part of the problem, it was frayed at both
connectors and not grounded to the bus.  Also, I unplugged the ground
without seeing which post it was connected to, is it the dual prong, or
the single one?

BTW, the switch was taped together with electrician's tape and masking
tape.

Any other ideas? She really wants to drive after dark, although I'd be
happier if she didn't.  Guess I can't keep her home forever, though. 

TIA for any help.
