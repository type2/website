Subject: [T2] Re: oil pressure sensor wire M.I.A. '75 Westy

The wire in question is blue with a green trace, and it exits from a 3-wire 
grouping whose other 2 wires go to either side of the ignition coil. The 
black spaghetti tube comes from the front at the firewall, straignt back 
across the middle of the engine.
