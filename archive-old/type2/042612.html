I changed a generator on a 71 without removing the engine.  If you have the 
doghouse oil cooler, remember to loosen the bolt that goes to the &quot;Hoover 
bit&quot; on the oil cooler.

As I recall 68-71's only came with generators so this looks a change made by 
a previous owner.  Be sure to check the alignment between the pulleys 
(alternator to crankshaft).  The cover plate to the fan is different between 
the bus and the bug to allow for a larger generator.  If the pulleys aren't 
aligned, somebody has mixed things up along the way.  This can really 
shorten your fan belt life.  All of this can happen because over 30 years, 
bug parts tend to migrate into buses, sometimes with unexpected and 
unpleasant results.

Good time to change the fan belt if it's been awhile.

&gt;In a 68- 71 bus, there's more than enough room to raise the fan shroud up 
&gt;to
&gt;pull the alt. assy with the fan out. You wouldn't try to pull it loose from
&gt;the fan in the bus, you'd do that when it's out. It's not really that big 
&gt;of
&gt;a deal, it can be done in one hour. If it's a dp you can even pull the 
&gt;intake
&gt;manifold loose for more room. I've done it plenty of times. Worse comes to
&gt;worse,if it turns out to be too difficult, you can always still pull the
&gt;engine.  Ed
