Subject: RE: [T2] Jack

Here you can see the jack in action.

You store it in several places, in a bay (you can store it in the back
under a hard plastic cover that holds the spare tire., In my westy I
store it under the passenger front seat.

&gt;My bus did not come with a jack.  I have not seen any documentation
stating what kind of jack to use or where to put it.  &gt;I have been using
the floor jack, but I don't want to take that on a trip.  Is it a
scissor jack?  Where is it stored?
