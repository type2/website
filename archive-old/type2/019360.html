I've owned two previously owned 71 buses.  Both had the hot start problem.
Installed relays on both and solved the problem.  No more push starts in New
York City.  No more leaving the engine running while gassing up.  If I were to
buy another used bus, the first thing I would do would be to install the relay
regardless of what the PO said.  If you can find the source of the problem and
solve it, great.  But a lot of times you can't because you're dealing with
electrical resistance distributed over a long path plus several slightly weak
components.

My 2 cents.
