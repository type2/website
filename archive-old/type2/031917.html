Danny:

Don't know how it is on your '75, but on my '81 if I unclip and 
disconnect enough stuff, I've got a pretty straight shot at the sensor.  
I made a special &quot;tool&quot; by taking a deep socket and cutting a wide slot 
down the length of the socket with a rod saw.  That allows me to snake 
the pigtail connection off the sensor through the slot.

&gt; Is there any easy way to get at the cylinder head temp sensor?  On my 
&gt; '75 2.0 FI its right underneath one of the manifold tubes below the tin. 
&gt; I understand theres a tool for this - will a deep socket work just the 
&gt; same?  Because there's a torque spec for this I'm assuming you have to 
&gt; remove the manifold tube - otherwise, how would you be able to get your 
&gt; torque wrench in there?
