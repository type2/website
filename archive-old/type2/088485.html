Anyone have a new., or used in good condition, accelerator pump =
diaphragm they'd part with for a price.  My Dells were rebuilt about a =
year ago.  Was putting them on the Motor a couple of nights ago.  When I =
installed the Linkage I noticed that one of the  accelerator pumps =
wasn't working.  I took off the cover and noticed it was just stuck and =
that the diaphragm had a tear.  Hate to have to buy a whole rebuilt kit.
