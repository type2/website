Subject: re: Free 78 bus FI system

I have to confess, I'm a little overwhelmed by the huge response to my offer of an FI
system.  I'm trying to figure out what to do.  Apparently, there are many worthy
people in need of this.  For those of you looking for spares, there are folks who need
the whole system, and I will try to give the system to one of them.  I won't have
access to this FI system till the weekend of August 1-2, but I'll try to figure this
out as soon as possible.
