Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Swap Info?

Just thought I would throw a little into the pot.

I think the engine swap has some merit, but a lot of downside as well.

A well known type II person on this list spent a lot of time and money to
install a beautiful engine and 5 speed into his westy.  The job was very
well done and the results were nothing short of light speed.  But after a
few years he tried to sell it and has had a lot of difficulty.

If you plan on keeping your bus, the engine swap will take a lot of time and
money, maybe 4 times the amount of time to rebuild a type 4 engine and at
least the amount of money.  In the end you will have a bus that will be
worth much less than you put into it.

I have seen many busses with engine conversions that could be had cheap,
just keep your eye on the Samba.  My suggestion would be, leave your bus
stock, sell it if you want, then by a converted bus for less than you can
sell your stock bus for.  You will have your converted bus and money in your
pocket not to mention you won't have to spend the time or money to do the
conversion.  If our friend on this list still has his bus, you won't find a
better, or faster converted bus.
