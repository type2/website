I would like to add my sense of frustration and loss to the bandwidth which is an indication of the joy we have gotten from 
Bob's Sermons.  Having restored one bus and started on another, many are the moments when the Sermon's seemed to be a haven of 
sanity.  Thank-you for all you've done, Bob, and if you're really gone we'll miss you greatly. If you decide to return in some 
form, welcome back. 

Joel, '71, '79 transporters
