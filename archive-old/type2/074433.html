Subject: Re: [T2] What is the stock tire size for a 1970 Single cab

&gt;185r 14 no aspect ratio means its about 80%. Mel


You guys need to do some research.  185R14 has about an 82% aspect ratio.
The original tire to a 1970 model was NOT a radial, but a 7.00 - 14 bias
ply.  It was a quite tall tire, compared to a 185R14.  Bentley lists the
correct diameter for the 1967 transporter's 6.40-14 tires.  With a little
math, you can figure out the aspect ratio, and the apply that to the
7.00-14 , which will then give you the correct diameter.

I've worked it out before (I own a 1970 campmobile with an original
Continental 7.00-14 spare which has never been on the ground), but don't
have the figures handy.
