Subject: Re: Brake Line Question

&quot;You may very well be able to buy pre-fitted lines.&quot;

I made some calls to my Baltimore area VW dealers about this, and got a
mixed bag of responses -- from &quot;VW never sold anything like that&quot; to &quot;we
can still order SOME of those, but you'll have to come down and pour
over the microfiche yourself.&quot;  I never did get around to going down
there.  When I do, I'm gonna try to borrow the fiche and use the
fiche-to-disk appartus at my local university research library to make
some copies.

By the way, I think the trick is to find a VW dealer where there is
someone still there from the aircooled era; this way, instead of being
treated like a freak, you'll be a break from the routine work of
servicing water-cooleds, an opportunity for a little nostalgia, and a
chance for the old guy to show the young turks that he knows more than
them.
