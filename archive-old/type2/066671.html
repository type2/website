Thanks guys,

Armed with the part numbers, I called Espar Canada and got some results.

Eberspacher part #201395 - no longer available
                 #201460 - available at the bargain price of 162.55$CDN

The actual part # is 201460470000.

Might take a while to get it though.  You have to buy it through an Espar destributor,
who has to order it from Espar, who has to get it from Deutschland.  Espar said 4 weeks,
the distributor said 2 days:-)

Hope this will help someone out,

...Markus
