Subject:  NY Inspection

List-
My new 72 Westy passed inspection yesterday. As it turned out here in New
York it does not have to pass emissions since it is over 25 years old. One
less thing to worry about. I'm not sure it would have made it. Last year my
other 72 had to pass and they didn't say anything about it being the last
year. They are changing the requirements here and will be testing cars
differently soon. I don't know if this was one of the changes but, I didn't
want to ask alot of questions and have them realize they made a mistake and
scrape the new sticker off the windshield.
I've seen a white Vanagon in Pleasantville NY (the town, not the movie)
that waves at me. Someone from the list? Let me know.
