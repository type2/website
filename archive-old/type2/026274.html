David,

You don't have to remove the window all the way, just drop it to the
bottom of the door.  To do this, you must first remove the trim panel
from the door.  Wind the window down part way until you can see the
channel at the bottom.  This is attached to the lifter mechanism by 2 M6
set screws.  Removing these allows the window to drop down further than
usual into the door, then you can get the scraper out.
BTW, all that is shiny is not chrome.  The trim is made of alumin(i)um,
and subsequently very easy to damage, so go easy with it.
