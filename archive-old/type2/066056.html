Subject: fuel pump

Hello,

I am not sure if I posted this or not, as I got no replies, so sorry if I am
boiling
my cabbage twice.

I need to urgently replace the fuel pump in my 2litre typeIV carb engine:-

Should I put a fuel filter inbetween the tank and pump?

Do I need an M7 or M8 spline tool to remove the bolts holding the pump to
the crankcase?

Is it possible to do the job without dropping the engine? Ther is an
offensive piece of tinware
obscuring the top bolt.  The tinware is a small verticle piece, three of the
four screws holding
it in place are easy to remove the fourth is behind the starter and looks
impossible.
Do I have to remove the starter?
