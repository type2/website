Subject: oil pressure relief plunger

Finally took the first step toward reassembly of the 1776 for my '71 Westy
last night  -  the case is sealed and the crank still turns!

 I then wanted to install the two oil pressure relief valves but hit up
against a potential problem.  Both of the pistons/plungers are identical.
For the '71 Ghiia I rebuilt last year the two are not identical -  one is
longer and has a groove cut in it.  I checked the green Bently last night
and saw that grooved one in his exploded view of the assembly.

What should be in a 1600 DP case?  A cylinder and a grooved cylinder?  Two
cylinders? Two grooved cylinders?

Thanks, Jack
