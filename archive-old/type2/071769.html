While I like a good modification as much as the next guy, I think you should 
always leave yourself open to putting it back. I wouldn't want us to find 
ourself in the same position as the split guys, remember when splits were 
plentiful and cheap and everybody hacked them up, now everyone bemoans the 
lack of good parts.
