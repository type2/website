&gt;If the waterboxer engine is equipped with Bosch Digifant fuel injection, it 
&gt;might be a good idea to salvage the knock sensors.

Depite the fact that the friggin things are 9.5:1 the Vanagon installation
of Digifant does NOT use knock sensors.  Never have quite understood
that.  As 2.1's do sure as hell ping on crappy gas, and they were just
putting them on the rest of the corporate offerings at the same time
'85-'86 or so.  Seems to me the one vehicle that needed it didn't get it.
Aside for the name there isn't much in common about the van Digifant
and that on post '89 Jettas, Corrados, etc.  There might have been one
Euro version of the van using a knock sensor if I recall right from a blurb
in the Haynes manual, but I don't know that for sure.
