Subject: Re: Folly's got balls!

&gt;The Folly does in fact have lots of balls, bright shiny ones.  Ohhh what 
&gt;a tricky to have you pay attention to yet another CV Joint question.
&gt;
&gt;I had a look in the archives and can't seem to find what I need to know!
&gt;
&gt;The rubber boot on Folly's '72 vintage CV seemes to be moulded into the 
&gt;cover.  Seems to be... can they be parted so that I can work on the joint 
&gt;without the rubber cap?  

     They can. Sometimes it's a real bitch though. If you look carefully 
at the joint, you can see that the boot is atached to a piece of metal 
that fits snugly over the edge of the joint. You just have to keep 
working at the little bastard to get it loose, especially when it's been 
there for 24 years. I use 2 screwdrivers, and a lot of patience, and 
perhaps a dip in the solvent tank, and it comes loose eventually.
&gt;
&gt;In the haynes book, it suggests that the balls should fit in the cage 
&gt;with a &quot;snap&quot;.  Folly's balls don't snap in the cage my friends.  They 
&gt;simply fall out of the cage. I assume this is because of wear n'est pas? 
&gt;does that mean the joint is finished?
&gt;

      A new joint is extremely tight, the older they get, the looser they 
get. The way to check for serviceability is to check the bearings and the 
cage for wear. If you can see the wear you pretty much need to replace 
them. But, if they're not broken thay can still be used for a few more 
months. But start saving for new ones...

Peace,
