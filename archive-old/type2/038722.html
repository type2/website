Subject: need carburator help

I have 1974 bus with 1978 2 liter engine equipped with 2 barrel Weber carb.  
The following numbers are stamped into carb base: 32.36 DFAV 23A M5.  I am 
loking for a manual or instructions on how to properly adjust the carb.  Can 
anyone advise on where I can get technical information?  Thanks in advance.  
Paul
