Subject: Re: [T2] Piston rings and Gasket kit

&gt;  I need some help (info )  I need a set of Piston rings and a gasket
&gt;kit for my 1969 1600 motor in my SC.  Here is the problem....
&gt;
&gt;FLAPS =$24.69..........$22.99 respectively
&gt;GEX    = $80.00..........$12.00........ But the rings are &quot;total seal &quot;
&gt;Rocky = $21.00..........$7.00
&gt;
&gt;I an looking for Good parts not just cheap ones
&gt;
&gt;Flaps are made by Field-Poller and Bakaley (sp?)
&gt;GEX ....................      ?          and      ?
&gt;Rocky..................     junk       and      junk
&gt;
&gt;Are any of the above OK ? Or should i try to find German.   Where can I get
&gt;German parts        ?    Also can i use the push rod tube seals from the kit
&gt;or should I go for Viton ?

I'd seriously go look at Bus Depot's website or call them. I've had great 
service from them.

I know, I know the list goes round and round on Bus Depot's service and 
quality but where else can you talk to the owner of the business if things 
go afoul?

There is also www.aircooled_dot_net , and a few others on the list. I would 
seriously try to do business with someone on the list.

FWIW.
