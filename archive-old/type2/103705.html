Subject: Re: Eberspacher BN4 installation 

&gt; Stephen,
&gt; I just installed the same heater in my '71. I did a lot of research first.
&gt; The best manuals I've found were provided by Espar. See the link at

I just got ahold of someone with clue at Espar and he's going to send
me the manual. This should help a lot. A couple previous calls to them
got me nowhere.

&gt; type2_dot_com in the library. They sent me a nice copy for free in about a week.
&gt; I still had a problem with locating the holes in the firewall and into the
&gt; passenger compartment because I didn't have the templates they talk about.
&gt; You can pretty much eyeball it though using the pictures and dimensions in
&gt; the pictures. Everybody recommended I remove the engine but I didn't and am
&gt; not sorry. It worked out ok. I used a combination of metal shears, drill
&gt; bits and grinder to cut.

I'll have the engine and gas tank out already, which is why this is such
a good time to install the heater. I have an air drill and a body saw, 
so I don't think that cutting the openings will be a problem. I was hoping
to get copies of the templates, but I'm sure I can either make some or
eyeball it.

&gt; I had a muffler shop add the rusted off part of the exhaust pipe onto what I
&gt; had. Mine was rusted off right about where it exits the body. You'll need
&gt; some hole saws to cut through the body for the exhaust, fuel line and
&gt; combustion supply hose. I used 3/4&quot; with rubber grommet for the fuel line,
&gt; 2&quot; for the exhaust (even though I need to caulk around the original heat
&gt; resistant grommet because the new exhaust is 1/8&quot; smaller than original) and
&gt; 1 3/8&quot; for the air supply line.  Ask me if you need any more help.

OK, that sounds straightforward. My exhaust pipe is solid but rusty. I'm
thinking of having a new one fabricated out of stainless steel. I guess
that will depend on how much it would cost.

Thanks!

--Stephen
