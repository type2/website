[...]
when i was doing some figuring on equipment changes i was going to be 
making by going from type 1 to type 4 vehicle i checked that.  the shop 
here estimates 325 for a complete engine.  I am not going to try and 
pick on of those up to put it back on my lifter.

&gt; Hey Everyone,
&gt; Well still trying to figure out what to do the westy has been driven 
&gt; to my uncle's house with a fully heated garage and nice work space. 
&gt; Just wondered what people thought of this drop the motor there in CT 
&gt; about 250 miles from my home take home in the back of my subaru wagon 
&gt; the turnkey motor bring it to the guy here and get the top end of the 
&gt; motor rebuilt assemble at home and the drive it back down with the 
&gt; turn key ready to go.  But anybody know the weight of the motor can I 
&gt; put that in the back of my wagon without killing my wagon a 92 Legacy 
&gt; too.
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Kevin
