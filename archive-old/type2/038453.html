The stock oil cooler is suffecient for a stock engine with all (or even
most..) engine tin in place, as well as all rubber and foam seals.

If you dont have all of the tin work, or the seals, spend the time and
money on .fixing. your cooling system, instead of monkeying with an
otherwise perfectly fine setup.


&gt; Also I have a good sized hole in my exhaust system (header with a cheasy

&gt; with a $79 one piece replacement from Bus Depot (Pacesetter Extractor-Type) 
&gt; or go with more of a stock setup?


Go with a stock setup.  If you can use the Pacesetter or Glasspack and
header, then I presume thta you do not need the cat...so a simple
stock-styled system is just fine, will sound better, and last longer.  Get
german, if you can.  May cost more now, but the fit is better, and they
last longer.

good luck.
