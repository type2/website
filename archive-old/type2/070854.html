well i had recently posed a carb problem on a 74 1600 upright motor in my 71.
i had been through it top to bottom and could swear that i had not missed
anything in that carb....but it just wouldnt run right.  so yesterday (tue ) i
rebuilt it one last time.  if this didnt do it i was gonna buy a new 34
pict.3.  anyways i rebuilt it with a stock carb rebuild kit.  all new gaskets,
orings, etc.  started it ..... still the same problem.  

so...i dug out my cash for the new carb......$148!!!!!  but i was ticked off
and that had to be the problem...there had to be a crack in the housing or
something plugging a jet passage way that wasnt getting blown out.  bought the
carb...took it home nad thought i will check the old carb over one last time.
as i was poking around in there i noticed the wire that runs from the choke to
the electro-magnetic solenoid to the coil, seemed to have a loose wire..(
where the two wires connect to each other at the electro cut-off )...so i pull
it and examined it real good and it was BAD!!!  i was thrilled.  i replaced
the wire jumpped back in the seat to crank it over and nothing...the same
problem still existed.  so i left the key on to see if juice was getting to
the solenoid.....yes it was, but i was not hearing that resoundingCLICK when
you turn on the key, so i swapped out the electro cut-off ) realizing that it
was definitely not working ) and put on an old spare one i had lying around.
still nothing....same problem ( wont idle )....finally took my pliers and
broke off the plunger end of the electro cut-off so that it made the switch
non functional....but so i could still screwit back in the hole it belonged in
on the carb.  turned the key.....and voila` it purred smooth as silk!!!!!!!
so thats that,  goes to show...even going over it many times an unnoticed wire
lead me to the diagnosis of a bad solenoid  ( which i promptly went back and
got from the vw shop with my $148 return!!!!!)  

cheers to all.............
