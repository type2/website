Subject: clutch cable

 My clutch pedal went &quot;bang&quot; this morning and it looks like one of the cable strands has broken away from the crimped end at the back by nut. The cable is 13 years old and I think the last one broken in the same way. Before I put my travelling spare on does anyone have any advice for keeping the corrosion away from that stress area? Just grease it up some?
