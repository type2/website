Well, BYOB at Red Barn in Prunedale was great.  There was plenty of cherry
Splitties, rough Splitties, a few Adventurewagens, a nice Dormobile and
a couple of nice Bays.  The swap meet area was also pretty good.  We
cara-bussed in and got in around 8:30 and started cruising around and
visiting with nice Bus-Folk.

Three big cheers for Strictly Vintage Type 2's on a great event, complete
with raffles, awesome weather, and great people.



Thanks,
