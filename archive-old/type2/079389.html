Subject: Re: [T2] WANTED:Transvair Kit+Just kidding

Clark's Corvairs (MA) owns OTTO parts which is the name of the company that 
makes the Trans-Vair kits.

They sell each part individually.

Their catalog is extensive. You'll need one for your engine parts needs 
anyhow so it's a good catalog to have...

Ciao!
