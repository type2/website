Subject: painting muffler

got a bus muffler from bus depot a while back, along w/ 2 nos heater boxes
for the 1600... degreased them &gt;not stripped, just degreased&lt;  and then
painted them all with a total of SIX CANS of rustoleum barbecue paint, the
expensive cans. six.  2 per item. let each coat dry 1/2 day, then
resprayed. then installed and idled gently for 20 minutes - repeated next
day.

paint is still there on each item. even the muffler, tho the exhaust pipe
is a pebbly surface, and not smooth, it is still green. heater boxes have
some chips where i bumped them during engine removals, etc but are fine
otherwise.


took a while, a lil pricey, but worked well for me. 2 years and counting.
