Terry,

    This is from VoA factory suggested repair time. In the real world I
would add about five to eight  hours.
    At any rate if your only two hours apart, at his labor rate of ???????
what is that in real money, $100.00 or so. You may be getting a bargain. I
would either pay his rate or find another shop. You don't want to PO the guy
just before he starts working on your engine.

R&amp;R engine, with air &amp; automatic: Operation code -10 01 11 2-
3.30 hr

Trailer hitch: No op code
.50 hr

R&amp;R both cylinder heads, engine  removed: Op code -15 70 12 0-
3.80 hr

Grind valves &amp; seats heads removed: op code -15 70 54 0-
1.50 hr

Replace valve guides: op code -15 75 24 0-
1.40 hr


Total  10.50 hr's

Good luck,

Tommy
