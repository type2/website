Subject: Re: horsepower question

&gt;Tops out at about 35mph and barely has the oomph to start out 
&gt;from a stop. on a SLIGHT hill, it will not go forward. 

I'd guess it's running WAYYY too lean.  Great way to pass smog inspection, but 
not drivable.  Look for disconnected vacuum lines.  Could also be that you're 
not getting any advance at all.  Hook up a stroboscopic timing light and see 
what kind of advance you're getting.
