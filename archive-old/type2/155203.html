Hey Jim,
         My name is Glenn and I am a VW-A-HOLIC. Recently bought a house in 
Spartanburg, SC, mainly to have a garage for my Volksie.  It's a sunroof 69, 
nothing special except it has been in the family since it was new.  I can 
remember the aroma of strawberries when I took my Mom to a pick-your-own farm 
and learned why they are called earth-berries [erdbeeren] in German.

All good wishes!
