Subject: [T2] exhaust studs for the people

at the suggestion of a list member i checked out maryland metrics
www.mdmetric_dot_com  they have not replied to my query but they will make
custom studs to order as the 9 mm 8 mm studs are impossible to find
(they haven't responded yet to my inquire, so they may have them stock)
maybe one of our kindly vendors (hint hint wink wink ;-) ) would be
interested in making a bulk purchase or custom order to supply the
exhaust stud needs of the aircooled community. It seems like a good idea
if the relative cost is not too high as  a vendor would become the sole
source for these proper sized studs. It seems ridiculous to drill and
retap a head just because the proper stud size is not available. Also I
don't know if they will take non bulk purchases if they do stock the
proper 8 x 9 x 38 mm stud so if there is interest and they do stock them
and they only sell in bulk i may make a bulk purchase and sell them at
my cost plus shipping to anyone who is interested. so those who would be
interested let me know. This is a preliminary survey as a don't have any
real info yet i just want to know if there is enough interest to make
this a  viable option when i do get the info.
Thanks
Jamie
