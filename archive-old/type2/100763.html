Subject: RE: [T2] From east to west , and back

I just made a trip to Canada this summer in my '71 westy.  I would suggest
going through Colorado then head north.  See mount Rushmore, devils tower,
custers last stand, and then up to glacier national park.  Pop on over into
waterton, Canada for a few days to rest.  The n.p. campground has free
showers and the views are breath taking.  Then come back into glacier and
drive over going to the sun road.  Make sure you take one of the boat rides
while you are on the east side of the park.  The views here are like a
dream.  Then head south down to Yellowstone and grand tetons.  Spend a week
there and go on all the ranger hikes you can fit in.  Tetons has a couple of
short hikes and there is a nice clean rv/tent park east of tetons that has
reasonable rates.  Jackson can get pricey and the park can be full.  After
that head back into Colorado and go from there.  Good luck and have fun!!
