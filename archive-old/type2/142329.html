Subject: Bad Gas Cap?

Hey, 

Has any one ever heard of your gas cap sealing to well?   I was driving home 
from the Eastern Shore of Maryland (about 160 miles) last night and had some 
trouble about half way home.  For some reason I was not getting fuel through 
the fuel-filter (its clear so I can see the gas).  I was not getting enough 
supply keep going at full throttle- it idled OK.

I called a friend- he suggested that I pull over and open the gas cap.  When 
I did I heard one heck of a rushing sound and the fuel supply to the filter 
went a slow trickle to a gushing Nigara Falls. I must heard been pulling a 
vacuum!?

Has anyone ever heard of this happening before.
