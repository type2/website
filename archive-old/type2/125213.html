Subject: Re: [T2] Strange problem

As I installed a new mastercylinder in my 80 Vanagon I started the engine
without the MC and also heard a hissing noise. The engine stalled after a
short itme. Problem was gone after I did finish the job. Defenitely vacuum
problem

Hartmut

&gt; Bizarre...the only thing I can imagine where hissing in the cab could be
related to engine trouble is a vacuum leak:
