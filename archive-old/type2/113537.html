Subject: Re: Propane valve repair - Seattle area

&gt;I'm looking for recommendations on a Seattle area place that can fix or
&gt;replace the non-functional propane tank fill valve on my 87 Westy.

2 types of vendors can help you. Those that cater to the maintenance and 
repair of motor homes and travel trailers and those that deliver propane 
generally to on-site tanks. Both will have people experienced with all the 
special hardware and fittings meeting propane industry codes. In Seattle 
there are at least a few places that sell the giant land yachts. Drive up 
Aurora and by the time you have hit Everett, you will have seen at the very 
least a dozen travel trailer lots. At least a few in the Auburn auto row as 
well. Seek a propane specialist in your hood and have them supply your fix.

Now, if you expect to be taking this on one of the dozens of ferry routes 
in our waters, do obtain the rules and regulations they require for 
portable propane. In the case of fixed tanks, just turning off the valve 
may be all that is needed to drive on, but do verify that, as some do get 
turned back at the line for non-conforming fuel transport and have their 
day spoiled after waiting in line for several hours. I would expect that 
the type of vendors above will be intimately familiar with these regs as 
well. This is like all repairs on your VW. Take the time to get it right 
the first time and you will get long term proper function.

And if you ever do get on the ferry to Friday Harbor be sure to ring me up 
and we'll have a beer and talk VW.
