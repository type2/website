Subject: RE: [T2] once upon a pre-owned tuna can

&gt;-----Original Message-----
&gt;From: Cliff Rhoton [mailto:commodore97210_at_yahoo_dot_com] 
&gt;    
&gt;But for a small population segment, the aura of T2
&gt;ownership is, is... I guess I can't put it in writing.
&gt; Can one say I &quot;love&quot; my T2?  Is that appropriate? 
&gt;Accurate?

Love could be the appropriate word.  I know from the experience that having
a pre-owned tuna can is not a stress free relationship.  Nor is it cheap for
that matter.  But, those times involved with our bus (whether good or bad)
always seem to be more memorable and leave a longer lasting, heartfelt
impression on our family than those involved with our Saturn VUE.
