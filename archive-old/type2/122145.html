Subject: COT OVER FRONT SEATS and more

Or you could simply have some fun with a sewing machine and make some.

Im having tons of fun doing cushions, covers, TigerStripe double curtains
and such.

It's just so cosy.
And yes more neon light pics with red and blacklights as well as Tigerstripe
curtains coming in the near future.

&gt; &gt;From memory, my 73 states something like 60 pounds on the childs cot and 
&gt;150
&gt; &gt;on the hammock cot.  If the canvas is fresh I'd trust it for that.  If 
&gt;it's
&gt; &gt;30 years old, I would only trust about half that.  The price of new 
&gt;canvas
&gt; &gt;for your cot(s) is cheap compared to an injury.
&gt;
&gt;It's 90 up front and 150 above. Like you say, the fabric and stitching is 
&gt;old and pushing the limit may result in injury.
