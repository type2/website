Subject: Re: [T2] looping thermostat cable

From: &quot;stevo&quot; 

 karl sez:
Sounds like you have a 68-70 bus..... my advice would be to get a 71 only air
cleaner. VW did away with the stupid cable and went to a themostatically
controlled intake flap.
 
 correct, 69 bus. hmmm... i better look that up. i have two or three air
cleaners lying around. just anything other looking than the one i have?
looks like a pain taking off the cable behind the intake...ugg.
