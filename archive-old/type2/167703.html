&gt; So tell me about your heat. What's worked for you, what was a mistake?

I have a BA4 under the front of my bus and recirculate the air from in
the engine comp thru the BA4 them back to bus. totally ignore the
engine heat, independent system and totally removed HE and tube to
rear.

keeps 78 deluxe bus toasty
