Subject: Re: [T2] Engine removal info (low ceiling) 

Bill, 

I have successfully removed an engine from a bay without jacking the bus
at all.  You need to do two things... First, remove the rear bumper (this
may be harder than it looks, you may have to grind off a bolt head or
two). Second, tilt it off the jack onto the floor and drag it out.  The
clearance is tight, but it will definitely come out.  The case will drag
over a solid concrete floor with minimal &quot;brightening&quot; of the bottom of
the case.  If you want to be more civilized about it, there is room for a
mover's dolly *barely*.  If you want to use John Hartranft's dolly, you
have to jack the bus, but only a couple inches.

One idea I have had, but not tried is:  Get 1 3'x4' and 1 3'x8' sheet of
plywood or Masonite (hardboard), put two or three sheets of plastic
between them and put that plywood-plastic-plywood sandwich on the ground
beneath the engine.  Using a standard floorjack and 1' length of 2x12 (as
a softener between the engine and jack) you lower the engine as far as you
can, then tilt the engine up on one set of cyls and remove the jack.  At
this point you should be able to slide the top piece of plywood and the
engine out from under the bus, no trouble.
