Last year I had the exact same Yokohama tires mounted on our Westy and also 
had two spare ones because at that time it was said that this model was to be 
discontinued...
Four of the six tires had thread separation within less than one year.
Sometimes this is hard to detect visually, but if you do what others have 
suggested and trade your spare for your suspected tire, you might find your 
answer.
