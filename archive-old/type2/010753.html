100k miles in Beatrice (long)

One day last week the odometer in Beatrice, my '73 Campmobile, turned over
60,430 miles.  100,000 miles with me as the only driver - no one else.  When
I bought her, she had 60,430 original miles and was pretty much original -
drivetrain, interior, paint, etc.  The only &quot;improvement&quot; was a 009
distributor.  It's still on there.  Bought her at dusk, but didn't turn out
so bad - a few little things not noticed, but no show-stoppers.  She was my
&quot;grow up&quot; vehicle.  I sold my Corvettes and bought the bus, another unique
vehicle.

We've been through quite a bit over the past 11 years.  For several years,
she was the family vacation vehicle for all of our camping trips and
vacations, mostly to Colorado and South Padre.  She always looked great on
South Padre parked in a field of those humongous Blue Bird (SnowBird) motor
homes, and some how seemed much happier.  She was my daily driver for most
of those years, until the crew cab took over.  She remains the vehicle of
choice for the &quot;coming of age&quot; trips I take with my children upon their 12
birthday - a whole week together wherever they want to go.

She hasn't let me down but a few times.  Dropped a valve once right after
startup.  Broke the center out of the clutch plate another time.  Plain
stopped another time, but was knocking just before.  Each time was a simple
tow home with the tow strap.  Interesting considering we've been as far as
1500 miles from home at other times.

Probably more important, Beatrice has been a teacher to me.  I thought I
knew cars pretty well when she came into the family, having rebuilt several
American engines, but I continue to learn as she shows me.  I've made many
mistakes, but the teaching's been gentle and I know more than ever now.
We've done the regular maintenance - brakes, bearings, valve adjustments,
etc, as well as learning through four different engines in her engine bay.
Not always due to engine fault, but sometimes just for &quot;fun&quot; and experience.
The original was fine when I got it, but when I bought a used spare, I was
curious how it would run.  So I installed it and ran it for 10,000 miles.
Put the original back in and ran it for another 10,000 miles, until it
dropped the valve.  Not the engine's fault - I had never adjusted the
valves.  As I said, I was learning as I went.  The next engine was a
shop-built 2000, with a Web cam and dual Dellorto carbs.  Had lots of power
and sounded good, but started sounding loose at 15,000 miles.  Quit after
42,000 miles.  So now she has a used 2000 from a '75 bus in her bay.  No
telling how many miles on the engine.  It knocks a little until the oil
pressure comes up, and has done so since I put it in over 18,000 miles ago -
it's a blessed engine.

But now I'm in the middle of long term thinking.  Whenever the tranny
rebuilder question settles out, I'll take it out and ship it off.  It will
probably be after the first of the year, because that's when I'll have her
new engine built.  It's a long term engine built by me using a lot of the
knowledge I've gained from 5 years on the lists (vanagon &amp; following).
Plans are for items to reduce maintenance and increase life -
counterweighted crank, hydraulic lifters, Mark Stephens heads, CDI ignition.
It should last for many more years, since she's semi-retired now, but still
used often.

Here's to the second 100,000.
