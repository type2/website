Subject: Thank you to Ron and the Bus Depot
Message-ID: &lt;0.d81af1e6.25527eef_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I would like to publicly thank Ron and The Bus Depot.  I have worked there 
for almost a year and I have had a great time.  Ron, Dan, and Mary have been 
wonderful and supportive of me. I would also like to thank the entire 
Volkswagen community for keeping it fun.
