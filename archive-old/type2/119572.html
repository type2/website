Subject: Re: [T2] Subaru Van's

What about Roadcow?  Britt's page has lots of info
http://www.roadcow_dot_com/rdcowdet.html.  It certainly isn't a drop-in fit, but
there are lots of people who swear by the Subaru conversion in watercooled
Vanagons (and some who swear at them on a regular basis).  If the 1.9L in my
'85 Westy ever gives up the ghost I might consider the Vanaru approach...

I'd like to hear from anyone on the list who's ac-

version and the difficulties involved in plumbing...
