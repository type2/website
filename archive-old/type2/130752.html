Subject: Re: [T2] Airs Update

Signed onto it. Search seems to work ok. Would like to see a field for
Cell Phone and/or Work Phone as well. And is it possible to get the
area code of the phone number into a searchable form? So I could say,
search the 206 area code for members? Other than that I really like
it. It's ugly, but I don't think you've tried to make it pretty at
this stage. :)

I'm &quot;O.K.&quot; in photoshop if you need any help making logo's, buttons,
whatever. I'm Super Mega broke so I can't help financially, but I'll
donate my time in whatever way I'm needed. :)

Chris
