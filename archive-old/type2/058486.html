Subject: Free bus seats, Princeton, NJ
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

There are some free bus seats sitting outside a friend's house in
Princeton NJ.  The address is 136 Mapleton Rd.  Mapleton is the road
that goes along the east side of Carnegie Lake from Rt. 1 near Harrison
St. to Kingston on Rt. 27.  In Kingston it's called Acadamy St.  Anyway,
there is a black rear full-bench seat and a gray middle 2/3 seat from an
early/mid bay window bus, upholstery very good condition, but hardware
status unknown (bolts, etc.). Go get 'em!  If you don't, the trash
collectors will take them on Monday.  If you want them but can't pick
them up today, let me know, maybe I can save them from the garbage for a
week or so.
