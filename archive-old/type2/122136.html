Subject: Re: [T2] isolators and regulator info - Thanks Guys!

(Snip)If the wires connecting the two batteries are small will this relay
failure
&gt; still be likely to occur?


Scott-

It my not fry the relay, but it may fry your wire, and anything near it.
Wire is not inert. It ages, and wears out and anything that makes it get
warm is wearing it out quickly. This heating and cooling can lead to broken
strands within the wire, which when then subjected to the same load will get
even hotter, ect, ect, until it burns like a lightbulb. Should this break
point be near a fuel line, or cause the circuit to short and ground out...

This is especially important in a vehicle, as there are also the issues of
vibration and corrosion to break down the wire.  This is why good quality
automotive, or marine wire is made of hundreds of strands, while household
wire is usually just a few strands and is very stiff. You will also find
good wire is also completely tinned to resist corrosion (and the associated
increase in resistance). If you want to increase the resistance of a circuit
(not that I see it as useful in this case), I would suggest using large
(small gauge) wire and adding a ceramic resistor. This would give you
consistent resistance, regardless of temperature or wire age.

Hope this helps answer your question.

Cheers,
Matthew
