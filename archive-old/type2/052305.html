Subject: [T2] Another shim/spacer question

I just re-read the article in the library on cylinder spacers and CR. It 
indicates that the total shim/spacer thickness doesn't have to be the same 
for every cylinder. I could definitely use an extra spacer on one of my 
cylinders to equalize the CR, but I would think that an extra .009 height 
would rack the head enough to keep it from sealing.

Any advice? Again, I'd appreciate a direct reply, if you would be so kind.

Cheers/Don Carron
