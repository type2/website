Subject: 68+ transporter interior panels

i'm doing a project in slow motion. hoping to find cargo area panels for
use in mine (68DC). little cut and paste for the cargo door, etc...68 had a
one-year (please correct me, perhaps more) beige m-code 36 for interior
stuff like this. up for cash, trade, or both. taking a long look at all
panel colors within the scheme. kinda like a long shot, but i thought i'd
try. lemme know   - steve
