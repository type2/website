Subject: Performance Mufflers for Busses

Hey all:

I recently built and installed a mild performance engine in my 71 bus.  It
has a header exhaust system, but I've been using the old muffler from the
old engine.  I have a &quot;Fat Boy&quot; muffler, but it won't quite fit, since the
body of the muffler hits against the moustache bar.  I talked to the folks
at Gene Berg, and they use the &quot;quiet pack&quot; type of muffler.  Unfortunately,
the guy I talked to at Berg didn't know much about the performance aspects
of that type muffler.  Does anyone out there in list land know anything
about &quot;Quiet Pack&quot; mufflers, or any other kind of performance muffler?  I
don't want to install a muffler that's obnoxiously loud, either.

Thanks!
