Subject: Re: [T2] gas heater question

I don't know guys, according to the VW Service manual for the BN4, the glow
plug should glow red after 1 minute at 12 volts, but the BN2 glow plug
should glow bright red with a voltage of 4 volts.

Do you have the correct glow plug?

&gt;&gt;I have a BN2 heater and I just installed a never used

&gt;&gt;doesn't get hot enough to ignite the gas.  As soon as
&gt;&gt;I  jumper 12 volts to the plug, it fires right off,
&gt;&gt;but with the normal 4 volts it only glows a dull
&gt;&gt;orange and won't ignite the gas.  Any ideas?

&gt;Are you the one that outbid me for that plug on E-b-a-y??  Grrr... :-)
&gt;Anyway I can tell you one thing, if you jumper 12V to that expensive glow
&gt;plug for more than a second it will burn out.  I will NEVER do that again,
&gt;and I'd advise you not to either.  If it won't light, it is likely a fuel
&gt;problem.
