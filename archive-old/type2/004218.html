Subject: Re: [T2] New seal in, why won't the engine go back in?

Nathan,
    Did you use a big crescent to turn the generator/alternator?  You have
to do this in order to match up the splines.

Hope this helps.
Isaiah Smith


&gt; Well I got the seal replaced and we raised the engine up and slide it
&gt; forward, the two bottom bolts are in the holes and there is still about an
&gt; inch to go. I cannot find anything the engine is stuck on. We lift the
back
&gt; end and push forward and it does not move. The rear support brackets are
&gt; around the frame, but it needs another inch before the holes line up. This
&gt; is my first engine installation, so I figure I am not doin something
right.
&gt; Any ideas?
&gt;
