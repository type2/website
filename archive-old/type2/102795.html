Subject: Re: [T2] Bosch H4 ... and less expensive alternatives

Ahhh---

These lamp conversions are brought to you direct from India---PackoStan,
and are just what they represent in the low price--Ca--Ca--

I had a pair--and got rid of them .
They throw a really terrible pattern on the pavement.
I found the lights shining up in the tree's--over on the right hand
curb--everywhere but where they were supposed to be.

Not a good value--actually garbage--

Pop for the Bosch--

I bought Hellas----and am happy with them.

You only get what you pay for---

Later,

Terry
