 Before i condemn the starter, anybody have any ideas or suggestions?  and yes, i do have oil in it.  Doest this sound like a starter/electrical problem--like the starter does'nt have the power to turn overf, or something more serious?

Check ground strap at the front trans mount; take off and clean, and reinstall. Possibly the plus(+) connections on the starter, too,  or the batttery terminal connections.
