&gt;I just failed my PA emissions test and am hoping for some guidance

First of all, what year bus do you have?

&gt;The limit for CO in PA is 4.00, my reading was 11.92

The idle mixture is far too rich. You need to have that adjusted.

&gt;The limit for HC(ppm) in PA is 400, my reading was 738

Could be any one these:

- fouled spark plugs
- improper timing or dwell
- poor compression
- vacuum leak
