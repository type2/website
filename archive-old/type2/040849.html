Subject: Re: alternator testing

Alex,

      I usually just take the car to a United battery or someplace that can
check the charging system.  They can usually tell weather the problem is the
alternator or regulator.  Since I know you have your engine out, Pep Boys,
Napa or Autozone should be able to bench test it for you.  I would trust any
of them.
