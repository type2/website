 How much vacuum is required to properly evacuate the

------------------------------------------------------

Max vacuum reached depends on the elevation. 

It is not how much vacuum you put on the system but
how long it stays on. Should be a minimum of 30
minutes.
 
Water will boil at room temperature at 29&quot; of mercury
at sea level.
This is the reason for evacuating the system. To
remove any water in it. Vacuum will not remove a
liquid but it will remove vapor. Liquid water turns in
water vapor when it boils [just like 'boiling away
water in a pot on top of the stove'].

Get a Mason jar, put a service fitting in the lid, put
an inch of water in the jar, connect a vacuum pump,
and watch the water boil away!

How much water removed will depend on the age of the
receiver-drier. If the dessicant is saturated, you
will not remove it all. This is why the drier must be
replaced each time the system is opened. The air
contains moisture, expressed as a humidity figure, and
the dessicant absorbs it instantly.
