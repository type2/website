Subject: Re: [T2] EMERGENCY IGNITION WIRING  HELP

--- Bob Lessard &lt;lessard_at_u.washington_dot_edu&gt; wrote:

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; My 78 Westfalia just pooped out. I installed a Tiger
&gt; CDI module 5 years ago and have had intermittent
&gt; hiccups, but until recently have not quetioned the
&gt; problem. It seems however, that wiring may be
&gt; causing me problems.
&gt; 
&gt; I want to revert to old-school stock ignition
&gt; wiring. Can someone please describe and/or draw a
&gt; diagram of the coil/points/condenser/CPU trigger
&gt; circuit so that I can rewire things and drive my bus
&gt; home. It has been a long time and I forget the
&gt; wiring.
&gt; 
If you pull the plug and turn it over (the plug on the
CDI unit) it reverts everything back to normal and
totally bypasses the CDI. Pull the plug out, turn it
upside-down from how it was, plug it back in. That
should get you home where you can do everything else
you want to do. If it doesn't, you probably have other
problems. -BaH
