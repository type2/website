&gt;I discovered a disturbing fact the other day.  My #3 cyllinder is not
&gt;contributing to the engine's power.  When I pulled the spark plug wire off,
&gt;the rpms did not change, whereas doing this for the other cyllinders slows
&gt;it down and makes it rough.  Engine does not run rough when the other three
&gt;are firing, although there is a little backfiring on decel.
&gt;
&gt;I ran the engine with the #3 plug out, and it appeared to be sparking ok.
&gt;plug was not fouled.  I smelled gas in the air coming out the spark plug
&gt;hole.  Any guesses as to what the matter is?

I hope it's not compression. Try these: Squirt some oil in tho hole and try
again. If it gets better it's rings. If not, switch plugs with another
hole. If the hole with the #3 plug is now NG, you've got a bad plug. If no
difference, switch plug leads. Sometimes the leads transmit enough juice to
spark, but not under compression. If none of these work, try a compression
test. If low compression, you've got a bad valve.  Good luck.
