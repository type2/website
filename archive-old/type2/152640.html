Subject: Engine Identification and Bucking problem help. . .

Hello all,

I bought this '76 camper a few months ago and it's now a primary form of
transportation for me (kind of suddenly).
I don't think it came with the original engine, but I could be wrong. I
bought it from a bit of a shady mechanic who had it just sitting around and
had to get rid of it cause he had to move shop.
It didn't have any carbs so I had some on another bus with a seized engine
(a '72 transporter) and we put those on.
It has the serial number #GD013347 on the engine just infront of the
distributor.
I'm new to Type 2's (but have 2 and I've owned 3 bugs) and I'm trying to
figure out what kind of distributor I have so I can buy a tune up kit from
Bus Depot. Any easy way's to tell?

The only problem I'm having is that the bus runs fine once I have it warmed
up, although it sometimes idle's too fast, but when it's cold it will barely
run. At low RPM's (in any gear when cold) it will buck very hard and barely
runs. It will die very easily. I've seemed to notice that if I have the
clutch in and rev the engine, then start to accellerate it will not buck
hard or at all and once I've driven 1/2 a mile or so it's running pretty
good.
The breaks seem to work great even when cold so my novice logic is that it's
not a vacuum problem, however I've never delt with type 2's so I could be
way off.
I'm going to try to replace the points and spark plugs as soon as I can get
some new ones, but other than changing the oil, I've done no troubleshooting
(too busy with my senior year of college).
It did have a new starter and new battery when I got it.

Please let me know if you can help idetify the engine or distributor or if
you have any idea's about the bucking issue.
Thanks,
BJ Clark
