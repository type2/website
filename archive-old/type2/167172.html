Subject: trip report

We have moved and now belong to the great state of Aridzona.

The '79 transporter was absolutely PACKED fron to back, top to bottom. I 
even opened up the sunroof to throw a few light items in on top before we 
left. (We also packed a trailer and hauled it with another vehicle.) We got 
a really good tail-wind around the Palm desert, and the whole family is very 
surprised with all of our mileage - for all cars involved.

Here are the specs:

Began _at_ Long Beach, Calif.,
odometer _at_ (1)35,219.9
fuel tank &amp; oil topped off.

Drove the 22fwy E. to the 55N, 91E to 215N to the 10E, to the 101 loop N to 
the 17N, to the 220W, to 89A. Average speed - 60 mph.

Stopped in Banning, CA for lunch
135,308.4 on the odom.
fuel tank 2/3rds full, added about three gallons to top off. Oil doing fine. 
Added maybe a pint.

Stopped in Blythe for ice, drinks, and to release Babel the fish whom did 
not survive the journey. RIP Babel, 2007 - 2007

Gassed up in Quartzsite, AZ
135,469.1 miles
fuel was 1/3 full, added _at_ 6 gallons, and 1/2 quart of oil

Stopped in Surprise, AZ for a late dinner,
arrived in Sedona and stopped.
135,710.4 miles on the odometer,
and a 1/4 tank of gas left.

490.5 miles, approx. 30 gallons of fuel : fully loaded with furniture, 
boxes, 2 people, 2 cats, and 1 fish (for part of the way) = 16.35 mi/gal.

Not bad?
A happy upcoming holiday to you all.
Stef
