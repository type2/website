Fuel injection is the way to go. It was designed for fuel injection and the 
changes that need to be made are not worth the money or time. The fuel 
injection system is almost perfect unless neglected (like setting 8 years) 
injectors either work or not, and the test is simple using an 8mm socket, 
remove coil wire, use rag and have someone crank engine see spray pattern. I 
ahd the same problem after the bus i bought sat for 6 years. A little carb 
cleaner, ECU connector for injector (with the wires), a 12v power source and 
LP air and a friend. Fill with carb cleaner set with inlet side up for a 
couple days, connect one side to power + and the other end free, then blow 
with LP air while friend intermittently touches other wire to ground opening 
and closing injector, do this till injector is clear and it does work. this 
works for all five injectors. keep a spare injector for the side of the road 
repair, cleaned junk yard injectors work just fine as a spare. My system was 
totally pluged and was dripping tar when iI pulled the system apart. All I 
did was clean and assemble then start. I've heard of serval people that have 
changed over to carbs and were NOT happy, some have changed back to FI. Also 
cleaned the fuel reg valve. I used copper wire to clean all the hard fuel 
lines and replaced the rubber. I even pulled apart the electric fuel pump for 
cleaning (real pain) and the fuel tank (next time I will have that done). I 
used kerosene to clean everthing with, except the injector i used carb 
cleaner. I have found a lot better performance and a big difference in hills 
with the FI. Your repairs could cost you free.
