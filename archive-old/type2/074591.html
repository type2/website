Subject: Re: telling if cam bearing is bad

&gt;so what is the symptom of a bad cam bearing, since many rebuild 
&gt;just the top end and rods?? Is bearing material magnetic (is it 
&gt;bronze?)  I had noticed some fine metal flakes in the strainer 
&gt;a while ago that appeared silvery, but was not magnetic.  

Cam bearing material is indeed non-magnetic.  If you aren't already, start 
checking/cleaning your strainer at every oil change.  The danger is that a 
piece of the deteriorating bearing may get into an oil passage and block it 
eventually.  I drove my 73 for 7500 miles (3 oil changes) after I started 
finding metal shavings on the strainer.

Curiously, a bad cam bearing often does have a symptom.  I can't tell you why, 
but a bad cam bearing is generally accompanied by a noticable &quot;ticking&quot; sound 
that you can hear around the top, center of the case with the motor running at 
idle.  A 300 year old air-cooled mechanic (well, he looked it anyway) told me 
that when I asked him about the metal shavings and sure enough, there was a 
distinct &quot;ticking&quot; that had just started recently.
