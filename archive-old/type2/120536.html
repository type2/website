&gt; Here's a couple of examples from MA. (my comments in
 parentheses):
 
 78 VW Vanagon (yep, that's what the ad says). Std.
 GD Int. glass and trans. New
 clutch. Alot of chrome. (champagne edition??) Have
 Title. $250 takes it away.
 Call after 3pm. Brockton 508-857-2945
-------------------------------------------------

GD [and GL] should be a Vanagon. I believe the year is
wrong.....
 
&gt; Here another one that is more in tune with what I'd
 buy:
 
 76 VW CAMPER. From TX. Westfalia pop-up. Auto. No
 rust. New paint and top. Bed,
 stove, table, etc. (so it's a deluxe - chrome
 yellow??) Starts and runs good.
 $2950; Call Eric. Medway cell 617-212-9929
 
-------------------------------------------------

No, deluxes never came in chrome yellow. A P27 deluxe
in 76 would have to be sage green.
