&gt; Boy, this is turning into dejavu, we just had this discussion about a
&gt; year ago or so.
&gt;  At any rate, Bill, you seem to misunderstand how the thermostat and
flaps
&gt; work. Once the engine warms up -- which as I said before, is pretty
damn quick
&gt; -- the thermostat and flaps just stay wide open until you shut the
engine off
&gt; and it cools down. There is no &quot;auto-regulation&quot; of any sort from
that point
&gt; on. They don't help cooling, they just help to get it hot quicker.

Yes, I remember the discussion last year.  In that discussion, I wrote
about the experiment that I did by attaching a pointer to one of the
flap pivots so that I could visually check the position of the flap. 
I discovered that at low outside air temperatures the flaps do indeed
modulate the flow of air.  On a freezing day, I stopped after running
at 55mph for a few miles.  The flaps were about midway in their travel
and were actually opening up due to the reduced airflow at idle.

The thermostat regulates the flap position to maintain a 70C outlet
air temperature.  Simple, and it works well.
