Subject: Westy Seating Question

Hi All,
	I am trying to figure out how many can sit in a Westy, And I am
trying to make up my mind on if you get more in a 74 - 75 westy, than a
68 - 73 and  76-79. Also, Do seatbelts come for the Jumpseat on a 68 -
73 and if not, is it a good idea to fit them, and have someone ride
there. OR, is the jumpseat just for when people are eating in the back?

I know I have been throwing a lot of questions out to this group, it is
just that I want to get one, and I want to get a good fit with whatever
I get. 

Thanks All,
Matthew C. Huntley
