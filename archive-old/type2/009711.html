PMJI, From personal experience, (I just got a pickup to complement
the VW &lt;G&gt;) I got better gas mileage with Synthetic over dino juice.
Running 73MPH on highways with dino, I got 19 MPG.  After I changed
to Mobile 1, I got 21 MPG.  When I had the engine in my 78 VW van
rebuilt, the rebuilder SPECIFICLY said dino juice for 3,000 miles
THEN synthetic would be good, but NOT until 3,000 miles.

Also, a side note, for the newer Corvettes, Chevy specified SYNTHETIC
oil in order to avoid putting oil coolers on the engines.  The reason
is that the modern synthetics can run hotter longer without decomposing.
BUT, they won't help you to run cooler.

&gt;         I think you'd find more difference if you ran the test at
&gt; interstate speeds. That's where I noticed the really big difference.
