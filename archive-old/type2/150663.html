Subject: RE: [T2] 68 parts

Chai,

Dude: just buy a new one.....it's $3.75 plus shipping from the Bus Boys for
one side only.
If you don't want to replace the other side just do that side you worked on.
Buy the way, I wouldn't go get anything welded (per Saturday's message).
If you do you will have now way of aligning the front end.
Take it to a alignment shop and have the other side checked out by a front
end person.
Not a tire person but a &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; Alignment person, the one that would do the
work if asked.
(recommend you don't go back to the place that replaced them for you
before!)
Most places will do a free inspection and let them know what happened to you
on the right side,
so they are sure to check the lower bottom ball joint on the left side.
You will need an alignment anyways after your &amp;quot;Major front end
surgery&amp;quot;....lol

Glad to see you are on the road again!
