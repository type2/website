The best advice I
+AD4-got for putting the +ACM-2 plug in was to stick the plug in a piece of rubber
+AD4-hose about a foot long, I used fuel line, then you can the plug right into
+AD4-it's hole and give it a few turns to set it, then put your socket in.
Worked
+AD4-perfectly.

I always use the plug box spanner (tube wrench) I got with my 63 Beetle.
This has got a rubber fitting in the end so the plug stays in. I think it
works on all plugs OK., though a regular plug socket may be needed to get
things moving sometimes. Did they supply one with the type 2 upright
engine? The type  4 just has a plain box spanner without the rubber.
