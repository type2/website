hey all...
you may or may not know of my trials and tribulations with my 70 
&quot;westFAKIA&quot;, delila.  well, it's time for me to say goodbye.  i recently 
picked up a 62 subhatch westy, dirt cheap, and that's going to be my number 
one priority as i've got the engine i need to patch the current one, and i 
know all that is wrong with it right now.  soo...if anyone is interested in 
the 70, here is some info:

1970 Deluxe Bus turned weekender:
currently not running, reason unknown; all parts to interior (weekender) 
accounted for except the over-the-bed compartment and side table; i have the 
child's cot; all electrical works as far as blinkers and stuff like that; 
one leaky(bad leak) brake line, otherwise brakes should be fine; tranny 
good; p-brake doesn't work (hmmm, imagine that), probably just needs an 
adjustment; steering good; body is in pretty decent condition, a few dings, 
rust spots, and there is a hole, no gash, in the floor on the driver's side 
in the pass. area; engine had work done, tune up stuff, heads re-surfaced, 
some new wiring, changed gen.(still have old one, and it's still good).
any questions, or interested parties, please feel free to contact me.
