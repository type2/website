Hey all,

Finally got our photos from the trip put together on my page. 

To go directly there: 

        http://coyote.accessnv_dot_com/wayback/ccc-9-96.html

There are van pictures (including Kath's '68 for those who are curious), 
people pictures, scenic pictures, a list of who came, etc.

If there are any problems let me know -- these pages were hobbled
together last night late. My apologies up front if I've mangled any 
names -- let me know and I'll fix 'em pronto! For the names, thanks 
go to Joel for his good memory and notes!

Enjoy!
