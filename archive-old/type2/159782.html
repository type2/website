Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Homemade air conditioner in a VW? G.Lyle?

&gt; What I have always done with my old metal Coleman ice chest is to keep a
&gt; beach towel folded on top of the chest.

Ayup.  From experience in the desert, this works a treat.

1)  Your ice DOES last longer leaving the meltwater intact until the ice
is just about gone, then it's a dead issue anyway.

2)  Keep your ice chest in the shade.

3)  Keep your ice chest up off of the ground, if at all possible.

4)  The wet towel works wonders!  Drape it over the top and sides and
keep it pretty damp with meltwater.  This keeps too much water from
building up in the chest, also.

If you follow all 4 disciplines, your ice will last at least twice as
long, if not 3 or 4 times if the ambient temp isn't blazing and you
manage to keep it in a sheltered spot all day long.

Frostily,

Teri
