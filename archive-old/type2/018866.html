&gt;Looks like these might be unavailable. I tried vw dealer and RMMW, WCM,
&gt;Wolfsburg West catalogs with no success. Does anyone know if these are
&gt;available anywhere? What is everyone doing with the by now disintegrated
&gt;screens on their old vans. If I can't find a replacement, I guess I can
&gt;fabricate something out of some 1/8&quot; mesh screen.

Ive been looking for that for my 72, was thinking about useing chicken
wire with alumium screen over it.. havent got around to makeing it
though
