Subject:      camper top restoring to shiny new ...

i was watching the SpeedVision channel and they had some boat stuff on
there, and lo and behold, they were talking about restoring fibreglas
boat hulls to like-new appearance. they used 3M Fibreglas Restorer &amp; Wax
and gave this number for more info:  1-877-3M-MARINE
