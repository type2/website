Mercedes, BMW, Audi, and Volkswagens- all HIGHLY recommend using the &quot;Premium&quot; gasoline aka 93 Octane here in the USA.

&gt;&gt; You should be using Super (93) anyway, on your Jetta.
&gt;&gt; All VWs (and any other European vehicles) were made
&gt;&gt; to run on the higher octane. (Just read the owners manuals)

Beware !! European octane ratings differ from US ratings (see archives for
several explanations).

Your type 2 does not require high octane. The standard in Europe iscurrently
95 octane but that's RON not ROZ (US).
I think buses require at least 91 RON. 87 ROZ is probably high enough.
