Charlie Ford, If you don't have any money, I hope you have some time!  If you
have time, you have all you need to get yourself rolling down the road.  It also
helps to have friends and a few tools.  Get John Muirs book, &quot;how to Keep Your
Volkswagen Alive.&quot;  This classic will help you more than anything.  If you still
have your old engine you need to find out what is wrong with it.  Many so called
blown engines have minor problems which can be fixed for small change.  If you
can find a used motor out of an abandoned or wrecked vw, putting swapping them
out is a small job, too. I think the world record for swapping motors is ten
minutes, though my own personal record beetle to van and van to beetle is an
hour and a half.
