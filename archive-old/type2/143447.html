Subject: Re: [T2]age old question(OIL)

My '82 Westy has really taken to the 10w 30 Mobil One.  Fully loaded on my 
camping trip to the Redwoods this summer it consumed 1 quart in about 1000 
miles.  I added one quart of 15w 50 Mobil One and have driven 2000 additional miles 
and the dip stick shows that the oil level is exactly between the two 
indicators so oil consumption dropped to 1/2 quart in 2000 miles.  The reason I added 
15w 50 was that the oil pressure light stayed on a few seconds with straight 
10w 30 and the addition of the 1 quart of 15w 50 immediately solved that and 
my oil light goes off within a couple of seconds after start up.

The advisors at Mobil say that I can use the 15w 50 or the 10w 30 next oil 
change but I think I will just keep this combo of 3 qts of the lower weight and 
top it off with the higher weight.

Incidentally, I do not have any oil spots under the vehicle when she is 
parked and I have a dime sized spot that is coming from the automatic tranny area 
after parking for 24 hours.  That spot has been there since I purchased the 
Westy in June.  

Chuck
