&gt;I want to buy some tires for my Westy. Any suggestions will be appreciated.

185R14C, load range D. No matter what the tire salesman says, buy no tires 
that are not marked thus. Westies are inherently heavier loads and must 
have these rugged specs. I expect not more than 10% of the tire stores in 
America will have them in stock. Expect special order to get them. They are 
not going to be 4 for $99 in the weekend-four-color-loss-leader-FLAPS-ads. 
Try for Continentals as they were stock on many T-II's.
