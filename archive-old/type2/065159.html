&gt;Hello
&gt;I have a 74 bus with a 1800cc carburated engine. I would like to

There is a single notch for TDC on the pulley, but it is really hard to
see.  Best bet is to try and catch your fingernail in it rather than
looking for it.  I think it's  on the back of the outer part of the pulley.

&gt;I know where they are on a type1, but can't seem to find them
&gt;here. Also, the manual says to adjust the intakes to .006 and
&gt;the exaust to .008. I had never heard this, and would like some
&gt;opinions on it.

That's the right way to do it.  Gives the exhaust a larger margin of safety
since they run hotter.

&gt;Also, which valve is intake and which is exaust.

Intakes are the two in the middle (think of how your intake manifolds are
positioned).
