Subject: How Hot Is Too Hot??
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hello Everyone...I dont currently have a temp sensor on my 71 Campmobile...so 
I have been doing the old stop and run to the engine compartment to feel the 
oil dipstick....after running the engine at around 45 mph for about 35 
minutes the dipstick is hot..however it is not so hot that I can't put my 
hand on it for a second or to. My bus seems to be running fine...I just want 
to make sure it is cooling properly. Any reccomendations for temp sensor's? 
Also any other type of ways to guage the temp of your engine without any 
sensors..Thanks for the help everyone...Adam
