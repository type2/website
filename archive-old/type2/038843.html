&gt; We hit the road and it still took us 9 hours to get

&gt; There really is never a point when you *miss* rush
&gt; hour, just faster traffic. It seems like it's always
&gt; rush hour around the Baltimore/Washington area!

officially it's a &quot;NICE&quot; bridge, Miss DC by 30 miles or so

&gt; rushing!  That and your left leg gets really tired if
