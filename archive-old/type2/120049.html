Subject: Crank case FULL of oil!!! Ooooh Nooooo

Hey Y'all,
While trying to start this old 1600 DP that I am
putting in my project 67, I noticed there was raw gas
coming out of the exhaust. I did a compression check,
all 4 cylinders over 100 pounds, thats good. I pulled
the oil dipstick out and the level was way high, thats
bad!  I pulled the oil drain plug and the case was
full of gasoline!
I have had this engine idling before, but not for a
couple of weeks, when it ran I didn't notice this
problem.
So how does all the gas get inside the engine case,
yet compression on all cylinders is over 100 psi? My
first thought was rings or valves but if these are bad
enough for that much gas to get by, wouldn't the
compression be way low?  Is my engine toast, or is
there an easy solution\explanation??
