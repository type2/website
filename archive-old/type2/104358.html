Subject: Re: [T2] Wire Routing

&gt; Anyhoo... all of my FI wiring was originally run under the intake runners,
&gt; which made it hard to unplug stuff for maintenance.  I'm thinking of routing
&gt; the wiring more out in the open for easy access.  The only possible reason I
&gt; can think of for hiding the FI wires would maybe be to keep them seperate
&gt; from spark plug wires? Anybody have any thoughts or experience?

I don't think the wires are long enough to run above the runners
