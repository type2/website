Subject: Re: type 2 and typ2 4 motors


&gt;a novice, but what exactly is the difference between a type II motor and a
&gt;type 4 and why would someone want to replace the stock motor with a type
&gt;II.

For the money, mostly. This was recently discussed on the list. For an
example, the Type I piston/cylinder/ring sets are commonly available for
$85. The Type IV ones are $300. The Porsche ones are $600 if that makes you
feel better. The Type I parts are far less expensive and more accessible.

Until recently it was impossible to get the appropriate tinware for the
Type I conversion but I know Just Kampers has it and I think Bus Depot just
got some sets.
