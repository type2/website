Dave,
i too have the trusty 72 dormobile. The cupboards once removed do indeed
reveal a nice rusty hole. The problem is that the rust you can see is only a
small part of what is a REAL nightmare. I thought about it, and squirted
underseal and then expanding foam into the the hole. This will keep out the
draft. You are looking at an expensive welding job. Do you have the two
floor arrangement? If so, look at the belly pan directly beneath the hole
you have found. Prod it. Has your finger gone right through? Thought so. Now
if I'm right this belly pan will crumble away and you will be able to feel
inside the sill. There is an outrigger there which is probably rusted away.
We are now looking at several hundred pounds worth of welding.
My advice - put the cupboards back. If the belly pan is shagged replace
that. An MOT can't fail what it can't see. Your van is old and how long do
you want it to last?

Hey..you won't believe this but some car just crashed into a line of parked
cars outside and is now nestling in a dent in the side of my van!!! He said
the brakes and the clutch failed together! Damn Ford Escorts.
Gotta go!!

Subject: A Dormobile weekend...


&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;   This weekend I thought I'd devote some time to my 72 dormobile.....
&gt;   Too cut a long story short, I decided to take out the large cabinet
&gt;section behind the drivers seat (rhd)... arghh ! There is a large rusty
gash
&gt;(about 5mm wide, 30cm long) on the floor section where it meets the back of
&gt;the seat (the seat back is also quite rusty, a gash at the level of the
&gt;bottom of the front door) also the near-side rear wheel arch is very
&gt;rusty... left side is fine !
&gt;What should I do... replace the floor section, seat back and rear wheel
arch
&gt;? If so... what is it likely to cost ?
&gt;
&gt;Cheers
&gt;
&gt;Dave K.
