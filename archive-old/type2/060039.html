Subject: DeMello crankshafts

Hi all

I was wondering if anyone in US has any contact details for Demello
crankshafts or what ever name they trade under. 

I have seen details of them in magaizines and they seem to be a pretty
reputable firm, except I cant seem to find a fax or telephone number
for them.

I'm looking to get a welded stroker crank for a type 4 engine project
for my bus

TIA if you can help

Darryn
