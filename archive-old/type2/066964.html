I had a gas stove in one of my vans a few years back which was fueled by a
propane tank.  I built an airtight box on the back deck which I vented to the
outside.  I kept the main valve closed whenever I was not using it just to be
safe.   I felt quite safe with this arrangement....John Jensen in Annapolis
