The only one I ever cut was a 66.  Now that I think of it, I didn't feel like I
had much choice at the time.  I was semi stranded out in the boonies with a bug
muffler and a torch.  Seemed like a good Idea at the time, if a bit tacky.  I
guess painting the flames around the hole was a way of easing my concience.
Still as time went by I got to like that dual exhaust look..The best thing about
an old VW was that it was yours and you could  do whatever you wanted to it
without permission from a bank, or without worrying about it's resale value
(cause it didn't have any).     John Jensen in Annapolis.
