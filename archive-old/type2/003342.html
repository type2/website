Several people have complained over the last day or so that Bus Depot
website was having problems with the shopping cart etc.  Our website
administrator has been unable to duplicate the problems, but did make some
minor changes that he thinks might have &quot;fixed&quot; things.  I'm a little
worried though because he doesn't think anything was wrong before, yet a
dozen emails from customers tell me differently.  So now he says the
&quot;nonexistent&quot; problem is fixed.  Do I believe him?

If anyone out there is completely bored and has nothing to do for about five
minutes, you could help me out by surfing my site briefly and letting me
know if the parts listings and shopping cart give you any error messages,
time outs, or whatever.  Really, this is not a lame attempt to sell parts.
You don't have to actually order anything, just start the process and see if
it lets you, then close your browser if you want to before you enter any
customer information.  I just want to see if a few people using different
browsers can get through the pages and shopping cart okay.  If you do find
out that it doesn't work, if you could drop me an email (busdepot_at_email_dot_com)
I'd really appreciate it.  Please be very specific about what page or
function didn't work. By the way, the site requires that &quot;cookies&quot; be
enabled on your browser in order for the shopping cart to work, so if you
have set your browser not to accept them, the shopping cart definately won't
work. The website administrator is leaving for vacation on Friday, so I'm a
little anxious about an unknown problem not being identified before he
leaves.

Thanks for your help!
