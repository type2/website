&gt; 	Hi George,
&gt; 	Gojo is playing both sides of the street... the container
&gt; I have is labeled &quot;Gojo Natural Petroleum Free Citrus Formula&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Its ingredients list starts, &quot;Water, D-Limonene, Linear Alcohol, Alkoxylate,
&gt; Aloe Extract,...&quot;

Mine doesn't have &quot;natural&quot; on the label.  Probably a different
formulation.

&gt; no &quot;Petroleum&quot; but plenty of stuff besides rain water.

And then there's the stuff that it dissolves and puts in suspension...
