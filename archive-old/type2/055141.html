Hi,

I think you can get this info in books about traveling and/or camping in
RVs. Different laws in different states.

&gt;&gt;Where can I fiind the rules, legalities, etiquet, etc. On VW camper
squating, from parking at  a Sheraton Hotel and checking in, to  pulling
over to the side on state Highway and spending the night?&gt;&gt;
