Subject: [T2] 79 FI engine coughing...now what ?

Ok..I've been tinkering with a 79 bus with FI that had sat for over 10 
years. I finally got fire to the plugs, so it was time to get some fuel to 
it. I hooked up a little one gallon gas can to the fuel pump so I would have 
fresh gas. Twice it sucked the little tank dry and I assume its pumping it 
into the vans gas tank. I took the air cleaner off and even moved the intake 
air sensor off so I could squirt carb cleaner down the intake throat(?). I 
could get it to cough and even run for a couple of seconds, but could not 
keep it running. Again it drained my little tank dry. Sure smoked like hell 
when it was running, but that was to be expected.

My question is, since I know squat about FI systems, what is the next step I 
should be taking to get this thing fired up. REmember to take it easy on me 
since I know nothing about FI systems and yes, I do have the official VW 
book, muirs, etc.

Thanks,
David
