&gt; I am proud to announce, I have finally put the CV joints on my bus, 
&gt; all four with brand new boots, torqued to 25 ft/lbs.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, I am sitting in a snow bank, picking the CV grease from 
&gt; under my finger nails.

Wow, most of us have a comfy chair in front of our computers.  You Canucks
sure have some strange interior decorating!  :)

&gt; The CV's all around were shot.

ALL of them??  I've seen one go at a time, and a couple of times I've seen
two bad ones, but all four?  I guess it has a lot to do with what you
consider &quot;shot&quot;!  I have one &quot;marginal&quot; pitted one that I put back in
during a time of little money about 75K ago.  It's still quiet.
 
&gt; Now I have to get my gas heater to cycle.

Don't do that!  You'll melt your furniture!
