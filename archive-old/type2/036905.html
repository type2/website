&gt;  Ignition on to listen to the radio with engine not running feeds

I was working on the car and left the ignition on to check some circuits,
coil actually caught fire!!!!!
    melted a lot of other wire around the distributor too, had a lot more
work to do than I planned that day, 

if you must take the wire off the coil
