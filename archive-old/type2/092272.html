&gt; A big thanks to Nick Palmer and his girlfriend (sorry, I don't remember her name)
&gt; for picking up where I left off.

Your welcome Ray. I only hope to do you proud. Incidentally, her name is 
Tamara, and she was so cool about my VW obsession that I married her!

Ray was the coolest! Not only did he give me the bus, but also a stack 
of manuals, and a stack of VW mags as well as a big box of parts. The 
bus needs lots of work, but I am looking forward to the day when it is 
on the road again.

Thanks again Ray,
-Nick
