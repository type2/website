&gt; I just got my hands on a compete (as far as I can tell) BN2 heater - so

&gt; All it seems to be missing is the glow plug.  I seem to recall someone
&gt; offering some up from a bulk purchase that was made, but that was more
&gt; than a year ago.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone have a manual for this unit?

all I have is the BA-4 stuff. but I think it is on line just can't
remember where I saw it ;8*{

you could get those glow/spark plugs from the dealer, but be prepared for
a huge sticker shock.  they quoted me $165 for one plug!!!!!

good luck
Bob
