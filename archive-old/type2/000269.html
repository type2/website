Just picked up a perfect walk-away side tent from a 71 Westy. No rips, no
tears, looks like new. All ties accounted for. Only got 24 of the poles but
the guy I bought it from has the other four and I'll pick them up tomorrow.
It is the same tent as pictured on Joe Clarks tent page. Since I don't need
the tent and wouldn't use it as I already have an awning, I'm going to play
E-Bay and see what it will bring (I am assuming I'll get the other poles
tomorrow.) If anyone wants it- let me know what it's worth to you. Shipping
extra. TBear

Don't take life too seriously- you'll never live through it.
