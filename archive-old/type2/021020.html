&gt; I have already pmailed the original poster on this request. The part he
&gt; wanted comes on a 914. It is the vent box with a oil filler mounted to the
&gt; top. It uses a screw-on cap, same as on a 72 to 79 bus type4 engine.
&gt;
&gt; On another 914 question: does anyone know if the flywheel is the same as on
&gt; a bus engine?
&gt;

Karl:
914 Flywheels are unto themselves (and 912E's). Porsche clutches are somewhat
different (215mm. but different setup and throwout bearing than type 2's)
Also, the filler-breather boxes are the same as 411 Vw's, I believe.
