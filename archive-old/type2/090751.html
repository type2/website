Heh. are there any that havent? :)

&gt; Besides the holes associated with the heat tubes
&gt; between the doghouse and heater boxes, my engine tin
&gt; has two matching smaller holes in the rear of the tin
&gt; (closest the bumper--behind and on either side of the
&gt; crankshaft pulley tin piece). 

this might not be 100% correct, but here goes. My bus is a type 4 but
my beetle is a t-1 engine (duh). I believe what these holes are are
the heat riser that is part of the single port manifold. top side
connects to the manifold, &amp; the bottom side is where the muffler has
those goofy looking heat risers. I'm not sure exactly how the bus
muffler hooks up, but this might be some lead.
