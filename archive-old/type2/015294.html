Harry,

The literal answer is maybe and maybe. Could be regulator and/or diodes
in the alturnator. Test diodes first, if good, replace regulator/brush set.
If bad, get a Bosch Reman and have another 20 years life then look before 
you zap in the future. Note also always disconnect the neg. terminal first 
and reconnect the neg. term last before and after doing ANY electrical 
device remove/replace, including the battery.
