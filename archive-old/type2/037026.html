Subject: Rear axle

I know that the tranny is different on a '77 and newer, does anyone know if
anything from axle to hub is the same on older models.  The kids took the
bus out of town, and the left rear wheel fell off.  I'm not going to be able
to look at it until the weekend, and doubt if anyone intelligent enough to
look at it and tell me what's broken before then will see it.  I know
there's a couple of buses around I may can get parts from, and want to try
to line up a donor by the time I get to look at it.  I need to know if I can
rule out anything earlier than a '77.

Joe F, don't I remember you mentioning Memphis?  You ever see any late model
loafs during treks to any boneyards up there?  May have to head up there if
I can't find anything here.

Thanks,

                                                            Frank Stroupe

three wheels)
