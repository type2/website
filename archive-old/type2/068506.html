Subject: HELP - VW STEERING 

hello guys.......
&gt;Please excuse the intrusion, but I REALLY NEED HELP!!!!! My 
man and I are 
&gt;busy converting a 1974 (or thereabouts) VW Kombi from air to 
water cooled. 
&gt;Our problems are:
&gt;
&gt;a) hooter wont stop hooting - suspect wiring is earthing in the steering 
&gt;column but cannot get it apart to check.
&gt;
&gt;b) flickers (indicators) wont work although hazards do. Checked the unit 
&gt;which seems fine. 
&gt;
&gt;We have been unsuccessful in begging or borrowing and even considered 
&gt;stealing wiring diagrams and so forth but to no avail, it's a bit hard to 
&gt;steal what's not available for begging or borrowing. 
&gt;
&gt;If you can point me in any helpful direction or if you can help in any way 
&gt;we would surely appreciate it.
&gt;
&gt;Many thanks
&gt;
&gt;Kim and Neil
