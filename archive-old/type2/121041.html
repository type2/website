  I added a 12V 300 watt heater like
 the one here

and added a clear shower curtain behind the driver's seat to keep the
heat up by me.  The heater does a fair job of keeping the chill off the
air down to about freezing (0C/32F) with no other heat source.
-300 watts?  That is not a lot of heat- I tried a similar one that fits
on the dash- not very efective.  For the best use of such wattage, I
found that trucker's electric 12v heating blankets are more effective-
sit on it and wrap it around you!  Have also used a housepower lap
blanket with an inverter.
