Subject: Re: [T2] Frozen oil plug on a '78

&gt;Just acquired a '78 Westy and I'm trying to change the oil, but the drain

&gt;advice.

So did you tear up the allen wrench or the drain plug? If it's the former you need better tools. If it's the latter then you'll just have to try a shot of penetrating oil and some vice grips on the outside maybe?
