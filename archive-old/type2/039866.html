&gt;Electric heaters (space and H20) do... I'm thinking of the former for mine.

Don't bother with the heater - it will drain your battery in under an 
hour.  Too many watts required.

&gt;Hmmm... Now all I need is a coffeepot and a microwave! &lt;grin&gt; In 12 Volts!

12V coffee pots are available at Pilot truck stops.  They even have two 
models!  Also 12V ovens (save your money), hair dryers, TV's, VCR's (buy at 
Wal Mart instead), etc.
