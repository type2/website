&gt; What is
&gt; the most successful (your definition, not mine) installation of a non-VW
&gt; motor into a bus you've seen?  

I've seen about a dozen; Corvair engine and transaxle into a Bay. 

&gt;Why?  

1. World's easiest engine swap. A simple kit adapts front and rear mounts,
CV joints bolt up to the Corvair diff axle yokes. It all fits in there.

2. Still air-cooled.

3. 2.7L, 110 hp, 154 ft-lbs torque _at_ 2400 rpm.

4. 6-cylinder smoothness

5. Gearing matches engine. (strength &amp; ratios) 

6. Diff ratio 3.55 = about 2500 rpm _at_ 60mph

7. Low-rpm quiet, half-throttle cruising at speed.

8. Excellent reliability. Engine doesn't work so hard.

9. Same or better gas mileage.

10. Excellent parts availability.

Around 3,000 kits have been sold since about 1972, and they are still
available.
