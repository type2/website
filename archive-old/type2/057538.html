Subject: Captain Geech is on the move

Finally, after a year of meticulus work on my '73 bus(Capt. Geech) all is
working and I took him for a cruise last night.  I kept checking the
engine to look for signs of trouble, guess what?  The thermostat which is
a refurbished one from Bus Depot wasn't allowing the flaps to open.  The
engine compatment is really hot and I am worried so I release the tension
on the wire to let the flaps open.  It cooled off at idle noticably in 5
minutes.  
	I live in northern Idaho and I thought the flaps would be a good
idea in the winter but until I get a temp guage for it the flaps stay
open.  
	I would like to thank everybody on the list who helped out a
newby.  I couln't have come this far with thier help.  My wife and I
cruised around feeling superior for several hours.  I replace the original
1700 with a 2000 engine and does this thing climb hills.  I was flying up
hills passing people who looked a little shocked to see a VW climbing past
them at 55 with no trouble.  The best part is the &quot;0-55 in 11 minutes&quot;
sticker on the back.  Well I'm rambling so I will finish.  Thanks again.
