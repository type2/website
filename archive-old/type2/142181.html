&gt; What if the internals weigh much more?

Hey, I'm no mechanical engineer, but I'll bite :-)

The total weight of the alternator would only make a difference when
accelerating the vehicle or when going up a hill.  The additional
rotating weight would only translate into power when the engine RPM is
changing, but not at steady speeds, assuming the losses due to
friction are not greatly increased.  I'm not sure how much either of
the stock alternators weigh.  Taking a quick look through google,
high-output (&gt;120amp) alternators weigh as little as 12 pounds and as
much as 35 pounds.  It's possible that a modern high-output alternator
would weigh less than the stock alternator.

Another power loss to consider with a higher-output aftermarket
alternator would be the losses due to the larger cooling fan on the
alternator itself.  I could see that being greater than losses due to
accelerating more weight.

Any of those losses are probably small compared to accelerating the
weight of an extra passenger, for example.
