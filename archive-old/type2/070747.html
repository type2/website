Subject: 1971 headlight dimmer relay

ok,

thanks for all the suggestions people have made about the highbeam 
switch on my bus - the consensus is that it's probably the relay, not 
the switch itself.

According to Bentley, &quot;The dimmer relay is the larger of the two 
cube-shaped relays on the back of the fuse box.&quot; Problem is, there 
are three relays on my fuse box, and they're all cube shaped. one is 
small, so that's out, but the other two are the same size, different 
styles. the three are spread evenly across the bottom of the fusebox, 
with the two big ones on the right and middle.

anyone know which one it is? i'm inclined to think that it might be 
the middle one, since that's directly below the two high beam fuses, 
but i can't see how things are connected inside, so that's just a 
guess.

also, does anyone have a working relay they'd sell me? bus depot 
can't find them, and i've only seen them for 68-69 buses on other 
catalogs.

thanks,
-perry
