Subject: Re: [T2] 72 WITH WEBBER CARB Mileage?

Hi Darren,

When you say &quot;quite a bit of gas&quot;, what kind of mileage are you 
getting?  While it would be great to get more than 20MPG, a 1700cc 
engine has to work pretty darn hard to move a heavy, non-aerodynamic 
box down the highway.

My 72 with a single webber carb consistently gets 19-21 miles per US 
gallon driving approx 80% on highways (but rarely over 60 MPH).  My 
wife and I have been travelling for months in this vehicle and it is 
HEAVILY loaded with stuff. (litres / 3.79 = US Gallons in Canada &amp; 
Mexico)

You may get slightly more MPG, but I think around 20MPG is typical 
based on previous list postings.  Other Volksters, what kind of 
mileage are you getting on your 72's ?

&gt;I read a question with regards to fuel consumption.
&gt;I have a 72 van with a single webber carb. It seems to use quite abit of gas.
&gt;does anyone know what may be causing this carburator to eat all the gas.
&gt;Could it possibly be an intake leak (vacuum leak?)
&gt;While I'm on this subject is there someone with a single webber carb
&gt;that can help me find out where the air / fuel mixture screw is? and
&gt;help me find out more about this carb?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks everyone,
&gt;Darren
