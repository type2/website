&gt; Are you supporting the entire weight of the rear end using a single jack

Yes, only two jacks available. Engine sitting on one. Helper who was only
willing to operate jacks or other &quot;non-dirty&quot; work.

I started with the jack and stands under the torsion housings, raising each
side one &quot;jackstand notch&quot; then moving to the other side. 

From what I could see my jackstands wouldn't be high enough even at full
extension. They started feeling &quot;wobbly&quot; at least two notches before being
all the way up.

I didn't like the way it &quot;felt&quot; so I found a board long enough to
distribute the weight along the tranny and I put the floor jack under and
lifted so I could get the jackstands out to figure out another way and
start over.

It was steadier than I thought it would be. Nice level ground, jack was at
a decent angle under the bus so there wasn't much side stress on it.

Well, it was almost high enough to put the engine under at that point. So,
I did. 

Yes, not good to do. But, mission accomplished.
