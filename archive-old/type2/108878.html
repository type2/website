Subject: Re: [T2] ruff gears in new/used tranny

&gt; Exactly how do you put gear oil in the tranny with the tranny still in the bus?

Get a bottle of Sta-Lube GL-4 and the pump with hose from places like NAPA or Car Quest. Remove #21 in this

Put your finger in the hole and see if the level is up to or near the edge of the hole. If it is, it is full.
If not, pump in theGL-4 until it is.


&gt; How do you know if it needs gear oil?

Remove #21 and see if the oil level is up to the edge.
#22 is the drain plug.
