&gt; Hello fellow listees!
&gt;  I have a question. Some buses have a removable body piece behind the 
bumper 
&gt;  that is removed to help facilitate the removal of the engine. Mine doesn't 
&gt;  have this. I was thinking about cutting out the same place in my bus, and 
&gt;  replacing it with a piece of metal that can be bolted into place. Has 
anyone 
&gt; 
&gt;  done this? Does it sound reasonable?
&gt;  Thanks,

Hi Matt,

Vw stopped the removable rear valence when they added the type 4 engine as a 
stock alternate power plant to the 1600cc type 1 to the bus range (now the 
type 4 engine is no longer a stock alternative to the type 1 the removable 
rear valence is now used again in current production T2s).

The fixed rear cross member was added to  the chassis in bearing the extra 
weight of the larger type 4 engines. So in theory if you remove it you will 
be impairing the structural rigidity of the vehicle.

That said I do know of vehicles in the UK whose owners have made the fixed 
rear crossmember into a bolted on one, and they report no adverse effects. 

BUT they must also be going to dodgy test stations for their annual road 
worthiness test as in the UK all load bearing parts of the chassis must be 
welded rather than bolted or riveted. Also the stamped on chassis number 
(which is on this crossmember) needs to be checked during the annual 
inspection and having it on a removable section is again a test failure. 
Therefore this modification is illegal in the UK.  Check with your local 
vehicle testing and licensing authority before getting out your hacksaw.

In the long-run it would probably be cheaper to buy a decent trolley jack and 
a pair of axle stands which you can use for lots of other things besides 
removing the engine.

Good luck
