Subject: Re: [T2] unsafe tires?

I think the key of the issue is a tire with a solid side wall rating to
handle the high center of gravity of your bus for stability.  I have always
bought the higher end of the &quot;best tire&quot; that I could afford.  My last
purchase on my 71 Westy is a set of lt195/75radial lt's all seasons tires
from Wes Schabb, which when driving on several terrains in Oregon have never
let me down.

Buy the best you can afford, and know your limitations..

&gt; Now that the hard work is behind me and the bus is on the road I'm
starting
&gt; to pay attention to all the various bus details this list has exposed me
to
&gt; sure as tires.
&gt;
&gt; I have lots of receipts that give me a good idea of the history of my bus
&gt; but I have no info on when tires were purchased. I'd like to get some
&gt; feedback on my tires:
&gt;
&gt; - I believe the front tires are perfect for the bus.
&gt;
&gt; - The rear tires seem underrated and I do get a lot of highway buffeting.
&gt; What should I do?
&gt;
&gt; - The spares are &quot;new&quot; but are they too old to risk putting on in the
snow?
&gt;
&gt; Front:
&gt; Continental Contrans
&gt; 185R14 6PR
&gt; Load C 1610 lbs at 55 psi
&gt; Radial 93/97 Q
&gt; Made in Great Britain
&gt; (~5000 miles; purchased in 1995 from VW dealer in Coquitlam when the bus
&gt; started to pull heavily to the right and it revealed that the tread has
&gt; seperated and a large bubble appeared on the tire.  I can't find the
receipt
&gt; but they were expensive).
&gt;
&gt; Rear:
&gt; Maverick LTR
&gt; LT195/75R14 M+S
&gt; Load C 1435 lbs at 50 psi
&gt; Radial 93 N
&gt; Made in Canada
&gt; (unknown purchase date; unknown mileage)
&gt;
&gt; Spares:
&gt; Michelin X
&gt; 185R14 M+S
&gt; Load 1540 lbs at 40 psi
&gt; Reinforced Radial
&gt; Made in Belgium
&gt; (These have unfortunately been studded for the snow but they have always
&gt; been on rims and inflated; means that these tires are likely from 1982!)
