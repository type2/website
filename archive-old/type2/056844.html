Subject: Re: POR-15 question

Fred:

I've used the stuff, and there are indeed pros and cons.

&gt;The can says to put plastic wrap between the can
&gt;and lid or the lid won't come off a second time.
&gt;How bad a problem is this?

Better believe it.  And kiss off the brush(es) you use.  I found that
the better way to deal with the can lid problem was to instead puncture
two holes in the lid, pour out into a paper cup just about what you
think you're going to need for a given painting session, and seal the
holes up air tight with pieces of tape.  Next session, peel off the
tape, if possible, or puncture it, or puncture new holes.

&gt;half a*s fixes

Yeah, but still better than nothing.  From my experiences with POR-15, I
conclude that it's not all that much better than something like
Eastwood's Chassis Black paint.  In instances where I used it over nice,
clean, pristine metal, I got a good tough finish.  I also used it on my
heat exchangers, and wasn't surprised that it blistered at the ends
where the shrouding metal meets the hot pipe, but it has since blistered
in other spots on the heat exchangers, which do not get all that hot. 
The worst performance I've observed is where I actually &quot;Painted Over
Rust&quot; - my heater control valves - the things with the flap inside that
control whether or not warm air from the heat exchangers gets exhausted
or directed into the vehicle.  I spent a lot of time chipping, scraping,
and wire brushing those things before using the POR-15.  Now they look
as bad as before I did them about five years ago.

I did use POR-15 and fiberglass cloth to patch some holes, in the inner
fender well right behind the front wheels of the bus.  It worked quite
well, but I cut it all out and welded in a patch panel before giving it
a real test of time.

I'm now better equipped than I was several years ago.  I have a glass
bead cabinet as well as a pressure blaster.  I attack rust with a venom
- get as much off as is possible, and even after that, treatment with
something like Oxysolv to get the microscopic bits is best.

I've concluded that painting over rust, with any product, is better than
doing nothing, but is just a stopgap measure.

Regards,

Giff
