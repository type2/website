I've never seen a bug get crushed, and it sounds terrible.  But the engine blow
I've seen.  They don't use volkswagen engines though.  I was at a show in
canada, and they used a plymouth reliant.  It was still in the car and
everything.  And they even offered to give it to anyone who could tow it away
right then and there before they blew it.

    So, I think, if there's a show you're at, and this is going on, and they're
using a real bug and a real engine, you should jump in.  Give them the starving
kids in 3rd world country speech.  &quot;There are people without bugs and engines,
so don't destroy these ones.&quot;

    It only makes sense, since production of vintage volkswagens is awfully low
nowadays.  We probably shouldn't be using them up like there's this big
unlimited supply.

    We should all be taking our anger out on yugos and subarus and things like
that.
