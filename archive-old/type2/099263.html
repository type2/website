Subject: Re: [T2] Samba Effect /RANT/ (and a little long)

Thank you Mick for a well written reply.

Someone wrote about 6 to 9 months on the list that every bus will cost 
about $5000.  Buy it fixed up or buy junky and do it yourself and you 
will end up spending $5000.  It is true in my case; $750 initial cost, 
aprox. $1700 for parts (thanks Bus Depot and Rocky Mountain), and $2700 
for painting.  Bottom line $5150.  By buddy bought a fixed up '74 camper 
for $5500 straight.

Thanks again for the good word.

Happy Thanksgiving.

&gt; I'd like to comment on the original point of this thread, the bus 
&gt; value question which started it.
&gt;
&gt; A year later, I am asking $5,000 for that bus and while I may not get 
&gt; quite that much for it, if I am patient I will get close to it. 
&gt; Because, you see, it is worth it.
&gt;
&gt; So you see, a straight, rust-free bus is indeed worth something. But a 
&gt; straight, rust-free, mechanically sound bus is worth a good deal more. 
&gt; $15,000? Hmmm. Not to me. But $4,000-5,000. Well, yes: at least, 
&gt; that's what my $740 bus has ultimately cost me, and I'm not counting 
&gt; labor.
&gt;
&gt; Bottom line: I still won't get my money back out of this bus, never 
&gt; mind the time (which I mostly enjoyed anyway). But someone selling a 
&gt; pretty bus in Oregon for $2000 doesn't affect that value of mine one 
&gt; bit. Let them sell it for that because chances are that's what it's 
&gt; worth. Chances are if you got underneath it and wiggled the right 
&gt; things and maybe measured the endplay of the engine and so on, you 
&gt; might think it's worth less.
