Belated reply because I was on trip- When I burnt a valve on way to Fla
from NJ (1973), I disabled that cylinder by pulling its wire out of
distributor and seem to remember stopping the valve motion by either
yanking rocker arms and removing pushrods for that cylinder or removing
adjusting screws to rocker.   Thus no gas could go in and no washing down
of cylinder walls by unburnt gas.  Those offended by imbalance of engine co
uld do the same on opposite side and putt along on two cylinders!  MB
