&gt; Hello there ,

&gt; I,m new to the list having just bought a '72 Danbury conversion, in which we

&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone heard of a mod. to the engine where an extra spark plug is added 
&gt; to each cylinder? I remember reading about this &quot;twin plugging&quot; of 
&gt; motorcycle engines especially big twins such as BMW's and Moto Guzzi's years 
&gt; ago. The benefits are supposedly increased efficiency in burning the gases 
&gt; with improved power coupled with increased M.P.G.

Twin plugs were added to BMWS to allow them to use lower octane fuel
without detonation.  Their problem was that they were designed for
high-octane fuel that became unavailable (at least in the US) so owners
were faced with the prospect of having to lower the compression ratio.
dual-plugging was a good alternative to this.

Doing this to a VW engine would be a bit difficult, as the heads aren't as
symmetrical top-to-bottom as BMW heads.  The plug would end up coming out
in the rocker box.

There _are_ dual-plug heads for VWS in aircraft applications, but the
plugs are right next to each other, not on opposite sides of the cylinder
as in the BMW application.
