Hi All,

   Just a note of thanks to all that contacted me with input on my trip.
I'm feeling alot better about this first outing .... and will be better
prepared. 

   My mechanic also thanks you since I will go back and have things like
the fuel lines checked and replaced if needed :) I sure my parts dealer
will be happy as well...my list grew based on those more *experienced*.

Happy Traveler Now :)
