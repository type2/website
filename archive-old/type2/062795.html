Subject: Brazilian Busses

Hey all,

After reading and viewing various pieces regarding those cool brazilian busses, my obvious 
question is &quot;HOW COULD I GET ONE?&quot;  I've read about how it's impossible to get 1996 beetles 
into the states but, I am a CANADIAN, we don't care about all that smog stuff ;)  SO, anyone, is 
this possible? Where would find out about the rules about importing? How much are they? 
etc.etc.  I know I'm probably dreaming cuz I'm sure I can't afford one, but it's Friday after all so 
I'm allowed :) Just curious more than anything, Comments??

Happy Friday (the first time I'm working one all summer! )
