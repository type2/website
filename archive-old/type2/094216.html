Subject: Sparkplugs 1700cc

Hey Folks,

What is the correct Bosch sparkplug for a 1700cc?  W8AC or W8ACC?

What is the tap to use to make the thread of a spark plug hole.  I want to
clean out my threads.

When I purchased my '72, two years ago, I ordered a tuneup kit.  It came
with Plugs, points, rotor etc.  The plugs that can were W8AC.  I did not
know any better than to assume that these were the right ones.

Now, replacing these, I got some AC/Delcos from my FLAPS.  These were
dimensionally different, the threaded part was longer, so I did not use
them, I instead ordered another tuneup kit from Bus Depot, I figure that
these guys know.  Well the kit came with W8ACC plugs.  Long, like the AC
Delcos.  Now I think that my originals were wrong.

As you can assume, putting these longer plugs in was a test of nerves.
Basically, I had to retap using the sparkplugs as my tap.  I learned that
Bosch plugs are better at this than the AC's.  I got 3 in all the way,
backed them out inspected them and replaced them.  They are fine.  One of
them did not make it all the way in.  I want to tap them all out.

Thanks for the help.
