Subject: Windshield wipers

I started  having a problem with the wipers in my 82' westy today when the
rains came down....It started with the passanger wiper quiting all
together....now the driver side wiper has quit too....the wiper moter is
still making noise as if it is still working and the blades are trying to
move, but only manage to make spastic little motions......any idea of what
happened here??
A small 2ndquestion while Im at it....any idea where I may be able to score
an owners manual (Online or hardcopy)?

Thanks,
Scott Thompson
