Be_very_careful of these kind of guys!  Its illegal to do what he advocates; 
the egr system actually does reduce nitrogen oxides, national air quality 
statistics demonstrate this; a functional egr system helps reduce cylinder head 
temps, something most bus owners actually find desirable; many states have 
visual emmissions equipment that your bus will fail without it; many potential 
buyers of your bus will knock $$'s off of the asking price if these things are 
missing.

It is completely an issue of personal ethics, the toughest kind of decisions 
to make.  If you are not concerned about air quality or your role in reducing 
it and you live in a state without emmision tests or visual inspections you 
can follow his advice with no negative consequences until it comes time to sell 
your bus.
