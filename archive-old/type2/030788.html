&gt;And if VW wishes to contact me for this somewhat petty matter, I would
&gt;be glad to purchase one from them or maybe they could photocopy one and
&gt;they could sell it to me--ya know?
&gt;
&gt;I guess I'll have to be more careful in my statement of requests in the
&gt;future!

Jeez-  Talk about petty.  Do we really need to get riled up over this sort
of thing?

Sorry, no '71 manuals, but I do have a '69 and a '74, I believe.
Duplicate copies, even!
