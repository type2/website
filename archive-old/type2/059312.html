Subject: Solex vs. Weber and how cold is it in WI?

Transporteers:

I can't speak for a bus per se but on my 2002 (which I just sold to
finance my bus, yeah!!!) the original Solex went bye-bye and was
replaced with a Weber 32/36.  That replacement is so common it's one
of the only mods allowed in SCCA 2002 racing.  So, can the Solex and
go for the Weber.

As far as the temps in Wisconsin, I'm from Minnesota and we have
similar weather.  It's DAMN cold in winter.  Try -30F air temperature
combined with 20-30 MPH winds.  I dare you to try and stay warm in a
bus!  It's not uncommon to see people driving around wearing
snowmobile suits.

I've lived in Maryland for about 4.5 years now so when the temperature
gets below 60 I get cold. ;)

Bob J.
