Missy, I would be the PO left the battery isolator in the bus, clean the
extra battery cables well before you hook up the second battery.

You may want to buy a short piece of 1/4&quot; NPT pipe at the hardware store.  I
would think a 2&quot; would do the trick, then buy a fitting that will screw to
the pipe on one end and your sender unit on the other.  Use some pipe tape
on the threads and screw it back into the case.

If you had mice in the engine bay, be sure to pull the cooling tin off the
engine and clean around the cylinders.  Mice love that area for nests, I bet
I have cleaned a dozen nests out of those areas.

Good luck on your trip.

&gt; ladies and gentlemen....
&gt; 
&gt; well, in the course of 3 hours, my better half and i managed to drop our
&gt; first engine.  no real problems, i must say!
&gt; 
&gt; but in the process of the whole thing...i came up with some questions....
