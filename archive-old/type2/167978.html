Subject: Re: [T2] 411 engine in a bus -Timing question

Greg

The reason for my showing 27 degrees _at_ 3500rpm on the 205H (Actually 205AH -
this is an error I will shortly correct) is that on all 411/412 Sedans &amp;
Wagons, timing is accomplished through a &quot;sight&quot; hole&quot; in the top of the fan
housing to the marks on the fan.  VW found that timing the 411/412 was
better at 3500rpm with the vacuum can disconnected/plugged.

Because of the installation configuration on a Bus prevents peering through
this site hole, VW used the timing scale to time the Type 4 engine
differently and at the 7.5 BTDC spec to accomplish the same timing
parameters - just different ways to arrive at it.

Basically, both distributors have closely similar advance characteristics,
so either method would work.

Note:  The full vacuum advance figure(s) shown usually back off by half when
the vehicle reaches crusing speed and the throttle shouldn't be &quot;floored&quot;.
Essentially at 3500rpm the 205H (AH) is running at almost no vacuum + 7
degrees (static) adv + 27 degrees full adv = 34 degrees (+-) (my 72 411
wagon does this exactly because I experiemented with a vacuum gauge while
sitting in the back seat with it hooked in-line to the adv hose while my
buddy drove the car down the freeway _at_ 65mph on level ground - had nothing
else better to do on a Saturday afternoon ;-) ]).  The 205P (which is a
distributor for L-Jet) is running with almost no vacuum advance at highway
cruising, so 7.5 + 24 = 31.5 degrees, roughly the same acceptable full
advance.

Remember, the vacuum advance is for advance assist during acceleration
*under load*.  As you back off the accelerator pedal, the vacuum signal
decreases allowing the mechanical advance to take over the job.  In a
*no-load* situation, such as sitting in your driveway, there will still be
some advance signal present and this is the main reason why VW has you
disconnect and plug the vacuum lines when timing at full mechanical advance.

Greg - If you ever decide to get rid of your 205H (AH) unit, lemme know,
because I would be interested in having a spare for my 72 411 Wagon.  Parts
are hard enough to find for these as it is.  Also interested in whatever
D-Jet Type 4 stuff as well.

Hope this helps :-)

&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; Here's a question for you all to ponder.
&gt; I have a 1.7L engine I am working over to put in my bus. It is a high-
&gt; compression engine that originally came with D-jetronic FI and a dual-
&gt; vac distributor P/N 022-905-205H. The timing spec  oldvolkshome gives
&gt; for that configuration is 27 degrees at 3500 RPM.

&lt;SNIP&gt;

&gt; Happy Trails,
