Subject: The DEATH BUS an SUV in disguise!

Going out to the rust yard thats about an hour away from me in =
Tuscaloosa a funny thing happened. I had a complete tread seperation on =
my right front tire. Now I took my foot off the gas peddle and let the =
ole bast_at_#$% coast to the shoulder. I turned to my 2 VW fanatic friends =
that were riding with me and said. &quot;You know what would have happened if =
I were a Soccer Mom in an SUV?&quot;, &quot;I would have freaked out and turned =
the wheel as hard as I could to one direction just to see how much I =
could make this thing roll!&quot;=20

Now the problem is that my old front tires were 75's I had the shop put =
on 2 60's in the front. What are the potential problems of running 75's =
on the rear and 60's on the front?
