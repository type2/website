Just looking over the ..&quot;Original VW Bus&quot;
by Laurence Meredith.. and I noticed that
he apparently has another book out..on
VW Vans....

anyone on the list previewed this book yet.
if so how does it compare with his first one?

I am just rebuilding my VW Van library,...any
other books , the list can reccomend?
