Subject: Re: [T2] shift rod bushings -front &amp; rear

--------------8E350E8E5DC38F0F96A0B0C6

Thanks for all the replies....

Hope I dont appear terribly dense, but let's see if I have
this put together right....I think I'm still a little
confused (a regular condition)....

1:   The front &quot;bushing&quot; is part number 211-711-182 and is
REALLY the front &quot;Guide Sleeve&quot; (item 10 Bentley,   fig.
3-14 page 10 Trans/rear axle chapter)  and (item10 Haynes
fig 5.13, Pg 93 Manual Trans chapter)

Correct?

2:   The REAR &quot;Bushing&quot; is/are actually (2) bushings....
part number (for the 77) 211-711-185B???.....

However.............Bentley (items 14 &amp; 16) and Haynes
(items 15 &amp; 16) shows two different 'styles&quot; of bushings for
the the rear shift rod........ a    &quot;front&quot; and  a   &quot;rear&quot;
bushing.  I'm confused.

Is this the same part, just drawn different, or is there
another part number floating around out there somewhere?

Are the &quot;two rear shift-rod bushings&quot; really just a
non-issue because -

a) those two bushings rarely cause noticable problems or

b) they're just too much trouble to mess with until it's
tranny-replacement time?

3:  And, last but not least,  I really do have to
move/re-move the tranny to replace the Rear Shift Rod
Connector, too?

After all this research, I still have a floppy shifter.
Soooooo....... First thing, I get a new &quot;Guide Sleeve&quot; (when
I know which part to ask for)  and maybe a new shifter; I
like my bug's EMPI (clean out my spare change jar) and just
hope I don't need a new tranny anytime soon, or I get real
greasy and try to track down (2) rear bushing(s) that fit.

(Gad, I love this stuff........!)

Thanks, all.

Joe
