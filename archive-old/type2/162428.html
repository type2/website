&gt; Hi, I rebuilt, with some help,  my 78  2.0 engine and installed it.  Had
&gt; the engine and short block balanced and assembled.  I installed the
&gt; cylinders, heads, etc.  Good news it runs absolutely great with only one
&gt; oil leak.  The oil lead is from the flywheel/ bell housing area.    What
&gt; are the possible leak sources?  Crank seal, and case mating areas?  any
&gt; others?

cam plug
