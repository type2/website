Subject: Re: rate of success removing exhaust studs?
References: &lt;ac.36f6150.261f4870_at_aol_dot_com&gt; &lt;005a01bff65c$e0fc04a0$a01bfc80_at_wustl_dot_edu&gt;

Last year when I rebuilt my 2L, I encountered a similar problem the day I
went to re-install the engine. The stud didn't break off; it broke &quot;out&quot;.
The head material around the stud gave way thanks to being weakened by the
use of an oversize Helicoil repair (not me!). The machine shop that my
mechanic uses came and picked up the engine, hauled it back to their shop,
welded up the broken area, re-tapped it, inserted a new stud and returned
the engine, all in a couple days time.

Total cost: $75.00. Aggravation level: none, after the intial swearing.

I'd take it to an experienced shop, but see if they can replace the stud
rather than weld the exhaust to the head. (Did I read that correctly? That
DOES sound barbaric!) Price it and compare to the cost of a new head.

&gt; This is a 2.0L pancake motor that had the 2 exhaust studs on #1
&gt; cylinder sheer off at the manifold, leaving about 1 CM sticking out of
&gt; the head, nestled between pushrod tubes and cooling fins once I remove
&gt; the exhaust pipe.  Archway did the heads about 2 years and 20K miles
&gt; ago.

&gt; &quot;...put the pipe on with a new gasket, and braze the pipe to the broken
&gt; off
&gt; studs with a gas torch and brass rod. It sounds barbaric and it is,
&gt; but it works like a charm and lasts the life of the engine.&quot;
