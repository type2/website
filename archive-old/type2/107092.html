&gt; Ok, so I thought it was for the battery, but maybe it's for the breaks?
&gt;


Yes, that light is for the brakes. It will also light up if your alternator
stops charging due to the way that circuit is wired. It is a warning light
that tells you if there is an imbalance in the braking system. Such as if
you have a blocked hose or malfunctioning master cylinder.
