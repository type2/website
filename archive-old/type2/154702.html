Subject: RE: [T2] Hybridizing the T2 (was Annual smog checks)

Heh, that is a good point. One man's definition is another man's potato
salad.

I'll revise; a typical Exhaust Gas Return (EGR) sends un-burnt fuel back
into the intake manifold to be re-burned, thus making fuel burn more
&quot;completely&quot;. This was a stop-gap measure to reduce un-burnt fuel from
entering the atmosphere. It was a system to &quot;force&quot; the efficiency of
burning fuel, not actual combustion/performance efficiency. The Japanese
seemed to get pretty good at it in the late '70s and early '80s, Detroit was
not. EFI solved everything. VW was way ahead with the Bosch Fuel Injection
systems in 1968.

As for the bus content; My EFI equipped Type 1 motor has a fraction of the
un-burnt fuel passing out of the tailpipe than my &quot;bone-stock&quot; '70 with a 34
PICT carb. No EGR system to make it more &quot;efficient&quot;, I mean &quot;cleaner&quot;, er
&quot;better&quot; or something along those lines... :)

Are you sure you heard correctly?  EGR increases efficiency?
