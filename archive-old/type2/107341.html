Subject: So Close...

Well then. My avp rebuild is back in and all hooked up, but won't quite seem
to run:

The dizzy was so far off that I had to shift all the spark plug wires one
hole counterclockwise to time it, but that was a cheap fix.

Here's what else I've done:

	Spark is good
	Static timed (tried a few variations)
	Dwell is set by feeler gauge
	Rechecked hose locations
	Adjusted idle screw
	Blocked off the EGR

The above measures got it to the point where it cranks, fires up nicely,
then dies out a second or two later.

I then Ohmed the AFM: All resistances are a little higher than Bentley
suggests, but maybe it's my meter... I also opened the flapper with a
screwdriver (ignition on), but was unable to hear the fuel pump run. I think
that is supposed to make it run, right?

The flapper switch does have continuity when opened a little on the bench.
However: The flapper continuity was intermittent when I bench tested it a
few weeks ago.  I cycled the flapper valve a few times and it started
working consistently, so I wrote it off to disuse for almost a year.

I suspect I need a new AFM, but wanted to hear what some of ya'll think...

Thanks!
