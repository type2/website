Subject: Single Cab Weight Distribution

Well, I never got an answer on the weight distribution specs, but I'm
happy to report all went well with the transport today, so it must be
close to 50/50.  We put it on nose first and centered it over the axles,
stopping just after the tongue began to drop under the single cabs
weight.  Took about two hours to get the 71 loaded and tied down on a 6'
x 16' tandem trailer (no winch, come alongs, and it had four flat tires
and seized drums).

I figure the combined weight of the trailer and single cab were about
3700 pounds, but my '89 4Runner handled the load without any problem.

It's been a busy bus week, got rid of two buses and acquired a fifth.
I'm eager to see what Chris has in store for the Adventurewagen ( I've
heard some talk of a Vanagon Westy interior ?).  Under the &quot;I will if
you will&quot; doctrine, I probably spring for an engine rebuild at the same
time Chris gets one.  Now I've got until Everybus to figure out what I'm
gonna sleep in.
