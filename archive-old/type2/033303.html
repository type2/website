All:

I thought I'd weigh in on the AVP issue here, having read Dave's account.
I purchased an AVP rebuild just over a year back and am very happy with it.
I sent my original engine in and got my original case back, rebuilt with
new P&amp;Cs and rebuilt heads (I don't think the heads were the ones I sent
in).  I sent my flywheel in with the engine, and it came back refaced and
with the endplay set correctly (I checked).  The engine runs perfectly (I
&lt;3 FI) and I have one very small oil leak where the oil cooler bolts on (my
work, not theirs).

After considering doing my own rebuild an researching different rebuilt
engine suppliers, I decided on AVP.  Erin had no idea that I was a list
member, but patiently answered all my technical questions before and during
the rebuild, referring some of my questions to Leonard (I think that was
his name).  I found them to be forthcoming and they told me exactly what
they did to my engine and why.  Based on my experience, I would recommend
them without blinking to anybody who needed a rebuild.  For many of us in
areas where there are very few VWs on the road, it can be impossible to
find reputable machine shops willing to do things like heads, align bores
and the like for these engines.  For people with daily drivers that are out
of commission, AVP's relative quick turnaround (1 week in my case) is
ususally way better than what you can do at home.  Based on my experiences
and those expressed on this list, AVP seems to be one of the best
alternatives available to us IMHO.
