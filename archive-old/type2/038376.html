Karl:

Yup.  We certainly do have smog laws here in Washington State but no 
inspection is required other than to pass an emission sample test.  (Which 
the bus did when I acquired it.)

Thanks for the engine number info.  Still looking for a reference that will 
cross reference engine numbers to year/type of vehicle installed.

Thanks,

&gt;That flange is for the EGR filter. You don't have smog laws where you

&gt;Engine # = you have one stamped into the the left side of the fan
&gt;housing.....do not rely on that one, fan housings get swapped around. Find
&gt;the real number on the case. It can be a little tough to see with the 
&gt;engine
&gt;in the bus. Look behind the square pcv/vapor box. It is stamped on a boss
&gt;between the fan housing and the square box.
