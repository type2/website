Subject: Re: Gauges for 16 yr old's mega tour

Jan Willem Brier got it 100% right:

	&quot;it's never safe for 16 years olds to go on a mega-tour alone,
	no matter what vehicle or how many gauges you give them.&quot;

But you might consider taking the tour with them. If you've done
that already and they really have to go somewhere alone, they
should be making a phone call at each arrival and have a defined 
place to stay at each step. An AAA or other road-service card
is a good idea, as is a cell phone, dual band digital AND 
analog. But they should really travel with someone, if a friend,
at least an older friend. 16 is YOUNG, and shouldn't be otherwise.

	Look, I was 16 myself once. When I was 15 I did a drive-a-day 
and camp for 3 days  trip with an older friend, the next summer I 
was 16 and went off with two other barely-older pals on a drive-a-
day-and-a-half trip with a week's camping, and a week-long drive 
with three friends from San Jose to Portland and back. Two summers 
later I drove with yet another friend from San Jose to LA for a week, 
staying with various friends. I wouldn't have made any of those trips 
by myself.

	The thought of a 16 year old with a new license and an old bus 
1500 miles from home just isn't comforting.

	Bill, who's son will be 16 in 12 years, 4 months!
