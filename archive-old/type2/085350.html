Subject: Oil out the exhaust-Troublshooting advice needed.

Hi All,

Need an educated opinion. Symptoms: one dual carbed 1700 (T4) dual =
carbs.
Grey smoke when running, slight sputtering, not quite backfiring at =
revs
above idle. Oil residue at the exhaust pipe. Compression chack =
performed per
Muir with 115 plus on all cylinders and with 5 psi of each other.=20

The cause? The only thing I can even come close to causing this is worn
valve guides or something. Am I on the right track or what? Similar
experiences? Any advice welcome.=20


TIA,

John B.
