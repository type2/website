I have a 74 Bus with the 1800 engine (currently running a single carb -
converted by PO). The Bus has 231,000 on it, and is on the second engine.
the current engine has 100,000 miles on it. The PO had it installed at a
garage, I think about 9 years ago. I do have the receipt, but not handy
right now. Everything still runs good now.

My plan is to replace the engine later this summer - before it decides to
go. It seems from what I've read that my Bus has done well with these
engines. Any suggestions on engine manufacturers? I would like to repeat
this type of reliability if possible.

Also, for any of you who have rebuilt your own engines.... I am a decent
mechanic - but have never taken an engine down further than the heads. How
bad is it to do a rebuild on one of these? Do you have to be a professional
mechanic, or is this something a competent amatuer can handle. If so, do you
have any recommendation on the rebuild parts - in terms of suppliers,
manufacturers, etc?

I appreciate any help. This is my first Bus - had it since last summer - and
my daily driver. This Bus has given me 10,000 reliable miles so far.
Hopefully I can get many more enjoyable miles out of it!

Peace,


Rob Witham
