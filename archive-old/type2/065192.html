Subject: FS:  '77 Riviera Campwagen Poptop Camper

This is the conversion that was discussed on the list about a week 
ago.  Poptop pops straight up (not at an angle like a Westfalia), 
with a bed up top.  Very nice conversion, and in good shape - sink, 
stove, large icebox, sofabed, spice rack, additional seat behind 
passenger seat, upholstered console box between front seats, etc.   
Camper is from California and has NO RUST and no dents. I bought it 
with a blown motor and fixed it up. Put in a '78 motor, with 
hydraulic lifters (needs no valve adjustments). Runs great. Needs 
only minor work (front brake pads, one exhaust stud, also one rear 
tail light is out). Has air conditioning (but needs a compressor). 
Asking $3850.  I am between Philadelphia and Allentown, Pa.   
E-mail or (610) 754-8989.
