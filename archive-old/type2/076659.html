&gt; &gt; Actually, the VW factory made some light duty heater boxes and put them on
&gt; 411's. (Possibly 412's too, but I've never dissected one.) These were
&gt; &gt; the same fittings as the 72-74 type 2's, only they just don't have the
&gt; aluminum radiators inside. Quite a bit smaller on the outside, too.
&gt; &gt; Apparently all 411's had Eberspaecher auxiliary heaters, so didn't rely
&gt; too much on the engine heat. I saw some NOS ones on *bay a while back, but
&gt; &gt; around here we need heat!

I have a 412 (BA-4) aux heater in my van

&gt; We happen to have a pair of NOS 411 / 412 heater boxes on our blowout page
&gt; right now.  $125.00 each

nice to know, but unfortunately I have no need for it, I have totally
removed my stock heat and just use the Eberspaecher for all my heat.

works pretty well, I recirculate the heat with the intake under the dash.
