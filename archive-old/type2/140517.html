Subject: Re: [T2] Where is the engine supposed to be?

From Richard Atwell:

I just broke a cable inside the bowden tube myself so I'm wondering what's
wrong with my setup...

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Usually, the cable breaks right at the point it meets the solid section just as you step down on the clutch 
pedal. Then the cable gets sucked into the bowden tube. If you still have the threaded end with the wing nut, 
how much cable is left at the threaded end? The weak point is where the wing nut pivots. Not enough grease 
there and the cable bends instead of pivoting. Then the cable snaps.

I have found that the new replacement bowden tubes are crap. Try to save your old one. You probably cannot 
pull the broken cable out of it? Unfortunately, if you keep trying, the cable binds completely and you will 
never save the tube. Before you try to pull it out, try to push back out the rear. Then cut the cable on the 
front end of the tube.
