Subject: Re: Regular vs Premium - something from another FAQ

I don't profess to know everything about this subject but I found this
interesting to read. It comes from an FAQ on another site I belong to. While
it might be a FART to some others find this to be worthwhile reading. Which
ever camp your in... Thanks for the bandwidth. Keep smiling, life just works
better that way.

Octane in gasoline is a measure of how easily the fuel is ignited by heat
and/or spark. The higher the octane number, the more resistant the gas is to
ignition. This becomes important if you have a high compression engine,
because as the piston compresses the fuel/air mixture in the cylinder, it
heats it up. If the mixture gets hot enough, or is not resistant enough to
the heat of compression (lower octane), the fuel will ignite in the cylinder
before the spark plug fires. When this happens, the piston is slammed
against the cylinder wall, and we hear what's commonly known as &quot;pinging&quot; or
detonation. Detonation is bad, and if your car pings, premium fuel IS
necessary. However, since most non-performance vehicles don't have high
compression engines.....

All gasoline grades have the exact same additives in them. The ONLY thing
that the higher octane fuels have that the lower ones don't is additives to
resist ignition. So, really, the only reason to run a higher octane fuel is
if you experience pinging or detonation in your engine. If you don't ping,
higher octane does exactly
nothing.

So, what's an oil company to do? There's all this &quot;premium&quot; fuel sitting
around, which didn't cost much more to produce than the regular stuff.
Turning to the marketing department, they convince
us that higher octane fuel makes our cars go faster, last longer and love us
more. We're subtly berated if we're so inconsiderate about our cars as to
not run premium in them, and praised for being a caring car owner when we
do. All of a sudden, that &quot;premium&quot; fuel is flying out the door at
considerable markups and profit, burning away in cars that don't need,
appreciate, or benefit from it at all.

Bottom line: burn higher octane if your car pings, don't waste your money if
it doesn't.
