Subject: Re: '78 FI question

Forgot who originally posted this question, but below is my response.

Hope it helps...

&gt;Greetings,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I'm STILL trying to diagnose a problem with my FI.  
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; My question this time 'round is:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 1. Do the fuel injector units receive a CONSTANT voltage or are they
&gt;&gt; pulsed?  
&gt;&gt; 
They are supposed to receive 12v constantly all the time the ignition is 
on.  When they are to be fired, the ECU grounds them.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; 2.  If they're constant, is it OK to swap the injector plugs between
&gt;&gt; cylinders?
&gt;&gt; 
Since all the injectors are grounded (fired) at the same time, it is 
perfectly OK to swap the plugs.  
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; 3.  On the FI plug, should one wire be ground and the other power?
&gt;&gt; Is it &quot;a bad thing&quot; to have voltage on both wires of the plug?
&gt;&gt; 
I don't think you should be seeing voltage on both, but...

Here's how to test.  With engine idling, remove one of the plugs.  The 
engine rpm should drop as that cylinder is taken out of the action.  
Take your voltmeter, put one terminal on one of the contacts IN THE PLUG 
and the other terminal on the other contact IN THE PLUG!!!  It does not 
matter which is which.  You should get a fairly rapidly fluctuating 
voltage (as the injector opens and closes).  This may be easier to see 
with a test lamp, as it will flicker.
