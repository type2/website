Subject: installing door seals
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hmm, I sure do have a ton of questions today!

Alrighty, I have all new seals for my doors (including complete front door 
seals.)  I perused through the archives and didn't find much on the best 
method of installation.

So, can someone direct me to a good resource for installing all of my door 
seals?  While in the archives, I noticed people suggesting 3M All Purpose 
Weatherstrip Adhesive...will one can do?

Also, where is a good source to find Dynamat (or cheaper equivalent) door 
plastic?  Also, I'm putting batt insulation in the walls of the rear, so 
I'll need to use some sort of vapor barrier...any suggestions?

Thanks again list!  I couldn't do this without you...I'm proud to tell my 
co-workers that my bus came with a list of enthusiastic and helpful &quot;club&quot; 
members.  I just hope I can one day be the person on the other end 
answering all of the questions.
