&gt; They won't be putting the logo on. I don't think any vendor wants to do
this after the way VW has treated them.

Good Lord, just what happened?!  It sounds like VWoA hired &quot;thugs&quot; and
knocked down people's doors!

BTW, I'm making sure that I don't misuse their copyrighted material, which
is what I usually do with any repro's that I decide to take on as a CF&amp;Son
project.

&gt; I don't know if [my front flaps are] as typical but they're wider than the
rears. I think some if not all Westfalia campers had them installed as rock
guards for the propane tank.

Looking at my own bus it looks as if one set of flaps can be made that will
fit both front and back; IF the flaps are made so that the excess flap that
would get in the way installing them in the back could be easily identified
and removed by the DIY'er.  Maybe a cut line included as part of the design.
I'll try to locate a flap or two down here and see if it's a workable
project.

In your valued (blatant buttering up [grin]) opinion, do you think that
making the front and back flaps the same width (as your front flaps are)
will work for the back flaps?
