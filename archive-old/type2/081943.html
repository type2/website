Subject: [T2]  Engine dies  :(


Why don't you just lift the engine lid.. Oh yeah you got the 72.. :)
Actually the best way to do this is to use a mirror and a flashlight.

You can go to the FLAPS and get a carb dunk kit.  I just used one last night
to help rebuild Derek's.  It is a very caustic chemical that will eat
anything out of the carb.  You will need to get a couple cans of carb
cleaner and some compressed air (office depot) Also get a carb rebuild kit
for new gaskets.

As for the rebuild itself.  I have not done a Weber but a Solex you take off
all the screws and gaskets everything you can see except maybe the
accelerator linkage.  Leave it in the can over night and then blow carb
cleaner both ways thru all the passages.  Then put all the screws and
gaskets back on.  Take lots of pics during disassembly and you should have
no problems.

 Hope this helps....

And as I said this was for a solex rebuild.  If a Weber is different I do
not know.

See ya on the mountain.. Hopefully one way or another...

Peace Brother,
Snoopy
