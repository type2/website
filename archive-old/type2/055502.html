Subject: Where do you work on your VW?

My 2 cents, plus one of the few tips I can actually offer.

I have a driveway, and a slab out back, but often end up doing things on
the grass, and always drop stuff-  little stuff that likes to hide. 
Well, I had these old speakers with a good size magnet....just run it
over the grass, drag it around a while, and youll pick up the part you
dropped as well as  parts off that Le Car you got rid of in 1983.

So tonight, go to the goodwill dropbox tonight and rip the speakers out
of that old stereo.  there you go.

-P.S.  I may have been joking about the goodwill part.  kinda.
