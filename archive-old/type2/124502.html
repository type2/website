&gt; The 0-0-Nein dizzy is long gone!!! Soon to be

&gt; the dizzy winds up to a higher rpm. No more
&gt; slipping the clutch trying to keep the rpm up or
&gt; driving through town in 1st gear so I can wind
&gt; the dizzy.  Just smooth fweeeeeeeEEEEEEEEEM as I

John,

I love the Pertronix also for the reasons you mentioned.  However, I use a
Pertronix 009 on my old 63 Porsche race car and I'd like to keep a spare 009
with Pertronix ready to go. So don't throw it on the trash heap; send it to
me and I'll donate some money to the list via Paypal.
