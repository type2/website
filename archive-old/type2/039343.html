Subject: My (mostly) successful return home

For those who've been keeping up with my situation on the '70 Dormobile that 
I bought but had engine problems 80 miles into our courtship, here's an 
update. Based on advice I got here, I decided since there was relatively 
little price difference in a rebuild and a new mexican engine, I went the new 
route. I also decided to take the plunge and start learning by rebuilding the 
old one myself. I picked it up yesterday afternoon in Pensacola Fl. which is 
a little over an hour away. I decided to take the senic route back and not do 
the interstate thing. About halfway back I think the bus and I both settled 
in and enjoyed the ride! My first experience was such a tough ordeal (280 
miles to go on maiden trip when the engine failed), that it took a little 
while to get the karma going! Hadn't driven one in 23 years, but it sure was 
great. My only problem was getting home and seeing a chrome wheel cover 
missing. Any advice here? I found what appears to be what I need at Old Volks 
Home site for 11 dollars plus shipping. I don't know if they come off the 
easliy or if I just had bad luck, but I think I'll order two and have a spare 
one. I also need to get the chrome &quot;volkswagen&quot; emblem that goes on the left 
side of the back door. Is there a chance of finding on at a salvage yard? I 
haven't researched the local junkyard scene yet but I'm afraid that the good 
chrome stuff is the first to go. Am I right?

Also, I must admit that I didn't think I would feel a need to give my bus a 
name, like so many on the list do, but when I got home my 2 yr. old took care 
of that and called it &quot;Bubba da' bus&quot;, so there you have it!
