Subject: Stock muffler == smooth running bus

Last week we finally replaced the old Thunderbird muffler
on our '72 Bus with a stock muffler from the Bus Depot.

The Thunderbird muffler popped a hole on the return trip 
of our vacation this summer and slowly disintegrated on 
our way back from New England.  The stock muffler also 
allowed us to install the trailer hitch we had for the bus.

But, the best part is that the bus runs much better new.
It has a single Weber carb, and would always stumble in
the morning and backfire a bit until warmed up.

Now, it runs smoothly right from the start, seems to have more
torque and is obviously quieter.  It's just interesting to 
see how much difference the right muffler makes.

One funny note - the bus has been parked for about 3 weeks
waiting for us to order the muffler, and then waiting for
it to arrive via UPS.  When the UPS truck pulled in front
of the house, the kids went running out, yelling back to
Diane, &quot;Mom!  The muffler's here!  The muffler's here!&quot;  They
even helped the UPS guy carry it onto the porch.

The UPS guy must have thought we don't get out much or something...
But that night Diane, myself and both our kids all helped
installing it.
