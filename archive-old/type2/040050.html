Karl,

I'm sure that it's a State Law call on whether something is or is not an RV.

Having the components built-in would make sense, since you can get a Coleman
stove, porta-potty, 12V cooler, camping sink, and blow-up mattress into
almost any vehicle, and dare to call it a camper?

That's too bad about the fixed toilet thing. If I was you, I'd lookup the
laws myself. There must be something on-line, no? In California, a camper is
defined in the &quot;Health and Safety Code&quot; (of all places), and referenced in
the Vehicle Code (ala my previous post).

If all else fails, make a toilet seat adapter to fit on the rear facing seat
(hinged, of course), and try again!

&gt; I just tried to have my 81 Westy insured as an RV (that is in
&gt; Delaware if it makes any difference). It needed a fixed build-in toilette
&gt; to qualify as a RV. So it seems it needs all of the above mentioned items.
