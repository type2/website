Subject: clogged injectors

Hi folks:

I believe the injectors on my &quot;79 bus (with AFC fuel injection) are
clogged with gunk. The bus sat for six years without having the fuel
system drained.

Before buying new injectors, I thought I'd take a shot at removing and
cleaning the old ones. Has anyone had success doing this? Any
recommendations will be much appreciated.

Thanks.

Rob Mead
