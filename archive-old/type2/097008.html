Subject: Re: [T2] Steering box new for $200.00

&gt; I found a good deal on new steering boxes for our buses. Better price
than Bus Boys
and not the rebuild Busdepot has dropshipped from RMMW.
&gt; www.thepartsbin_dot_com

To bad they dont have them for a 72.

And this is the same front for that parts warehouse there was a thread
about, a week ago. Wonder if it will take them as long as it took them to
get me my brake drums, 2 months. And I wonder who is rebuilding the boxes
for them or are these brand new Brazilian boxes?

&gt; No offense to Ron who I think has a great business ,but up yours Bus
Boys for your
&gt; terrible service.

Well thats rather harsh isnt it? If you think BB is bad try waiting on this
turd of a company to send you your order.
