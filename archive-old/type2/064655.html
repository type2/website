&gt; &gt;Well... that makes your van worth somewhere between $7K and $11K,
&gt; &gt;doesn't it? From the description, I'd say closer to the latter price. It
&gt; &gt;must be reassuring to know you can get your money back, if you decide to
&gt; &gt;sell... and can find anyone who'll pay those prices.
&gt; 
&gt; I _paid_ $7k for my '54!!  I was hoping more like $40k when restored.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;BTW, I'd like to shake the hand for anyone who'd pay &gt; $10K for some of
&gt; &gt;these vans.
&gt; 
&gt; There's sposed to be a deluxe for sale in the Land of No Rust for $60k

Yep... and in the Land of No Rust it will stay.

I can see paying $7K, or more, for your van, if it's in good driving 
condition. Add a $3K for body work, and a complete paint, and you are in 
the $10-11K quoted price range. Since you did the body/paint yourself, 
you can be pleased that you saved yourself a couple grand.

I think old VWs are still too common to be worth the really big bucks. 
Maybe we need a campaign to get the old rusty vans pulled in and 
scrapped, and the good ones shipped overseas to the land of the rising 
buck... errr... sun. Then the few that we have stashed away will be 
worth a lot more.
