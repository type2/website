Subject: Re: Stereo Wiring

&gt; &gt; on(don't want to burn that coil).  I was thinking there should be some
&gt; &gt; way to wire it to the on position for the key, for normal operation, and
&gt; &gt; with a switch for listening while the key is off, camping.  My current
&gt; &gt; radio is hot wired, and it's kind of a pain to turn it off and on all
&gt; &gt; the time, especially around town.
&gt;
&gt; This is tricky, since you don't want current feeding back from the &quot;aux&quot;
&gt; switch to the ignition.  You could do it with a diode if the current
&gt; handling capacity of the diode was sufficient to handle the stereo.

You could just run a &quot;always hot&quot; wire to a switch, then splice the switched
end of the switch to the wire that is connected to the &quot;hot when bus is on&quot;
wire, then to the appropriate wire on the radio.
I can visualize this very well but the explanation is lacking.  It would be
cheaper (and probably easier) than trying to find a diode that could handle
that kind of current.  If you need a better explanation P-mail me and I'll
draw up a diagram.
