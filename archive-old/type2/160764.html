Subject: Re: [T2] Pics of the dangers of a front mounted spare

It was my fault that I backed into my bus with my CRV. The rear
mounted spare on the CRV made direct contact with the fromt mounted
spare on the bus at about 2 MPH.

Bumpers are supposed to reduce impact to the body of a vehicle. The
front mounted spare allows most anything (CRV rear mounted spare at 2
MPH) pushed the bus spare into the body.

Spare or not, a frontal collision even at 10 MPH, much less highway
speeds would do a bunch of damage. Especially if whatever hits you or
you hit rides up and over the bumper.

Nobody drives a car to get in a wreck. But it happens. Wear a
seatbelt. Drive defensively.
