Hey all.

I am about to switch my mechanic.  I've had alot of botch jobs that, 
although my current mechanic is willing to fix his errors, i'm tired of 
dealing with.

So, I'm going to try Always VDub.  We've been going to them for parts here 
and there and have a pretty good feel.  But before I actually bring my bus 
there for work, any Portlanders have any feedback for me.  Good or bad??

TIA!!!
Nothin left to do but smile, smile, smile!!
