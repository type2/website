Subject: Re: [T2] External Oil Cooler Kits Whose to Use?

on 6/25/03 10:39, Theodore Reshetiloff related:

&gt; Can it be done with the engine installed?

theodore,

here are my opinions on your questions:

the only problem with the kits is that they use oil lines with clamps and
barbed fittings. the chances of leakage are high with this type of line. i
would not install an oil cooler this way, i would have the lines made up to
order with proper swaged threaded ends. it will cost a bit more this way.

changing the oil pump with the engine installed is best left for an
emergency situation. i would pull the engine to do it. it will make things
go more smoothly, you will have a good chance to mock up the lines etc.
there will be plenty of mocking up needed to get a clean installation.

the thermostatic sandwich plate adapter is the way go, mocal make one.
everything will be a tight fit under the fan shroud, which is why it is best
to install it with the engine out, as you may have to finesse it a bit.
