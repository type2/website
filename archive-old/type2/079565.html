&gt; not possible with the 009 and having a setting of 7.5 BTDC. At that setting

&gt;     Today I got to thinking about the advice given to me earlier in the 
&gt; year. &quot;Set the timing at 32 degrees at full advance....&quot; I know if I do 
&gt; this, the static timing goes to 11 ish.
&gt;    I figure if anyone knows, someone has to know here. What's everyone elses 
&gt; take on this???

I made the same mistake when I got my first type IV engine...you will
NEVER be able to get a 009 to work well with this engine.. bite the bullet
look long and hard, search auction sites, but get by hook or whatever the
correct dizzy for that engine. the difference is amazing
