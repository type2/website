Subject: Re: [T2] Westy water tank leak ('79)

Hoare, Brian S sends:

&gt; I have a crack at the bottom of my water tank, in the threaded area where
&gt; the pump motor screws in. Is there a type of glue that can be used to seal
&gt; this crack effectively?. If not, are there any replacement water tanks on
&gt; the market either original equipment, or otherwise?

Try fiberglassing it.
