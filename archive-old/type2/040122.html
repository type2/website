Subject: Gas hoses and oil wrenches

My suggestion to use silicone on your gas filler hose was as a temporary stop 
gap, to keep you on the road until permanent repairs could be effected. If 
it's contra-indicated, DON'T DO IT!!  Sometimes, when the right part can't be 
had, ya gotta make the wrong part work. 
When I lived in Nebraska many years ago, there was a company there named 
Leverench. They made excellent locking pliers of all sizes and shapes, that 
for my money, made Vice-grip look second best. They also made an oil filter 
wrench of 1/2 inch square hollow metal barstock,'bout 6 inches long,  with a 
2 inch wide nylon strap attached. You use a 1/2 drive ratchet, and I have 
only once in twenty years failed to get a filter off with it.That filter 
finally came away in pieces. lots of pieces. don't know why. Stanley bought 
them out, and I don't know if their filter wrench is still available. 
However, it was simplicity itself, and you could make one from an old piece 
of seatbelt material, and a piece of square tubing. Hacksaw a slit in one end 
of the tubing, sew a loop, fold it over, sew again,  jam part of it down the 
slot, hammer it shut, and viola!  Unless it's completely oil soaked, it'll 
grab, and give you a good stiff lever arm however long your ratchet is.
