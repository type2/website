Subject: Re: [T2] Fried wire solenoid to alternator

I am in Colorado Springs.  And yes, I do have a red &amp; white bus... But I
haven't been over to the Denver area recently.  How did you know??

OK.   If my starter motor is OK should I replace both starter &amp; solenoid?
Or just the solenoid?  It seems if I'm going to go to all the trouble to
take it out I should replace both, but it's $$.  Maybe I can find somebody
to buy my old starter to rebuild...

Anyway, yeah, I will need to replace the wire and to do that (it definitely
leads down into the alternator and is fried all the way) do I need to remove
the alternator also?

Thanks!!

&gt; Off the top of my head I'd say your solenoid is sticking (you found
&gt; that) and shorting or drawing too much current for that wire to
&gt; handle.
&gt; 
&gt; Replace the starter. Replace the wire.
&gt; 
&gt; Where in CO are you? There are a few of us scattered around Boulder
&gt; and Denver Metro (Aurora and I'm in Highlands Ranch).
&gt; 
&gt; Wait a minute... You wouldn't happen to have the red &amp; white one would you?
