&lt;&lt;    In my continuing saga to simplify my life and garage, I've got an 8 
track 
 player for sale. This was represented as working when it came to me in a 
 parts deal. Its an Audiovox w/am-fm, even got the wiring diagram still on 
it. 
 I have not tried it, but I only want $35 bucks or interesting trades. I'm in
