&gt; he said it was a problem related to the Fuel injection, which he said I
&gt; would have been  better off with dual weber 34ICTs, (which i already have
&gt; on my type 3 engine in my basement, collecting dust. they will gladly come
&gt; off if need be). he said it could also be a vaccum leak.

Vacuum leak?  Good possibility.  Better off with carbs?  Time to change
mechanics.  FI is unquestionably better than carbs.  Better mileage,
lower emissions, easier starting, better running, etc. etc. etc... He
obviously doesn't understand FI.  It's also easier to tune and fix on
that rare occasion that something fails.  Mine has nearly 200k miles on
it and in that time has has the AFM, the double relay and the Temp
sensor II replaced.  Were it carbed, I'd have replaced the carbs at
least twice due to wear in the throttle shafts.

If I could afford FI for my type1 it would have it!

&gt; 
&gt; Im really, really worried. What if it isn't just a vaccum leak?
&gt; there is a 'sucking' air sound coming from the engine compartment AND
&gt; when you rev the engine the brake pedal goes down by itself with the speed
&gt; of the engine. Im really hoping this is a simple  problem. 

Need a new brake booster.  There's your vacuum leak.
