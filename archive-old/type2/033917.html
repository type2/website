If you want to evaluate a vehicle, give it to a teen-age boy.  Note:  I 
stress &quot;give!&quot;  If they have to work for it the test will not work.  If you 
give it to a teen-age boy and it hold up for a week or more, it probably is a 
great vehicle.  So, if someone with two teen-age boys have vehicle problems, 
I don't worry about that too much.
