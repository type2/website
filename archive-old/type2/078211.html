Subject: RE:[T2] Jump start blues! - second thread

No, you can't spin the engine backwards,even down a
hill!
Heard a story from Pim Van Loon about an old tractor
in Holland that a farmer accidentally push started in
reverse...pushing it forward.
The engine started &amp; ran backwards,very roughly but
ran nonetheless.
Any how he noticed his mistake with the gears &amp; put
the thing in 1st.....and backed straight through the
barn wall:-)
As far as boiling the battery &amp; having the generator
not work then be able to stustain running, I had a
battery that I accidently ran flat by leaving the
headlights &amp; foglamps on.
A road service mechanic jumpstarted me &amp; I drove
60kms(about 40 miles)home &amp; went inside for 2 minutes
&amp; then the damn bus wouldn't start!!
Yet an hour later it was fine &amp; started no problems.
:-)
Cheers
Andrew
