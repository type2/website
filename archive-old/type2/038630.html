Subject: Re: no power at injectors on 2.0

[...]

&gt;  when we disconnected the plugs at the injectors and put a meter on
&gt; the plug... nothing.  tried this both ways with the key on and while
cranking
&gt; the engine over with the starter. nothing.  we are getting 12 volts up to
the
&gt; series resistance block from terminal 88b of the double relay when the
&gt; ignition is on.  we have continuity at the resistance block plug through
each
&gt; individual resistor.  all very equal.
&gt; about this point we ran out of light.  does any of this make sense to
anyone
&gt; or has anyone been down this same path before, and could give me the next
&gt; possible step?

Are you sure you are getting a trigger signal?
You should have a 3 wire harness coming down from the heater blower. The
black wire goes to + on coil. The white wire goes to - on coil. The 3rd wire
goes to the oil pressure sender.
You should have a single white wire coming across the engine from the
passenger side. This also goes to - on the coil.
If either white wire is not on the negative side of the coil, you do not get
a trigger signal to fire off the injectors.
Also make sure both ground wires are connected to the ground lug mounted
under a case bolt under the left front of the plenum [the football shaped
air box on top of the center of the engine]. This is the ground for the ECU.
