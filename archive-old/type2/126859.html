  shroud??

&gt; Hello List,
&gt;
&gt; Quick question: Will the generator, generator stand,
&gt; and fan from a 1600cc SP engine work with a 1600cc DP
&gt; dog house fan shroud? I am getting a rebuilt 1600cc DP
&gt; engine to put in my 68 bus. I wanted to use the
&gt; generator, stand, and fan from the old SP engine with
&gt; a set of dog house tin and shroud, but I wanted to
&gt; make sure they were compatable with each other.Is
&gt; there anything I should be aware of when doing this?
&gt; Any suggestions?

I believe that all of these parts will work with each other.  However, I
don't know if the fan you have is the narrow or wide variety.  Both will
work, but the wide variety moves more air for the doghouse cooler.
Measurement is indicated here!
