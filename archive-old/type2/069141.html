Subject: Help w/pilot bearing removal

Hi all:

I still have the engine out of my '74 bus.  I now have all the parts I
need to put it back it (clutch stuff), and since I have the whole week
off from school (WSU), I'm gonna do it this week.

I am having a real hard time getting the pilot bearing out.  I have
managed to break off the front (outer) lip of the bearing in trying to
pry it out with some pliers.  I have gone around to all the hardware
stores in town to find a bearing puller, but all they have are bigger
ones, the pull teeth will not fit in such a small hole.

So, any suggestions will be helpful.  Also, when I ordered the pilot
bearing, it came with a little felt ring.  The old one had no felt
ring with it, so I don't know where it goes in it.  Any help will be
most appreciated.   

PETE
