Subject: Re: [T2] Help! - Now it's gas in MY oil!

Hi Greg,

Thanks for your suggestions. I was initially going in this direction,
which is why I asked about it a few days ago. The other respondent
thought my 4 mpg was typical for the severe operating conditions. I
was still a little concerned because the time I took it on the highway
for 60 miles, I still only did 8 mpg.

What was the real alarm today was the presence of oil 2 to 3 inches
above full on my dipstick. The funny thing is it wasn't real watery
like you would expect with that kind of increase in volume. But what
is real baffling is that after moving the bus onto the lawn, it was
only 1/2 inch over full.

I said stock 73 westy, but I forgot I have an external oil cooler that
installs where the spin on oil filter goes. I wondered if the oil
might have drained out of it. But I have never ever had the experience
of the oil reading higher on this bus. Perhaps it has simultaneously
developed a stuck anti-drain-back valve in the oil filter (mounted at
the remote cooler to the front of the left rear wheel).

When I bought the bus, I knew it needed attention at the carburetors
because there was a long-term accumulation of varnish build up from
evaporated gasoline covering the carbs and manifolds. Plus, once it
warmed up, it would not idle at a stop light. I hadn't made it a high
priority at the moment since the carb area did not seem to be
obviously seeping gasoline and it ran reasonably well.

So here is what I did today. I cleaned the carbs and manifolds so I
could observe for fresh leakage. I checked the needle valves and
floats. The right carb was missing the dump tube, so I swapped the
upper half from another carb.

I ran the basic procedure for setup of rebuilt carbs. I found the
right carb way too rich on the volume control screw, being one or more
turns open than standard starting postion of 2 1/2 turns. I also found
the left carb had the throttle plate way too far open for initial
positioning.

After setting these I ran the procedure for setting volume control.
Before starting, I observed CO readings of 8 % or higher. Adjusting
volume control for 500-700 RPM reduced CO to less than 2 %. After
setting master idle speed to 900 RPM and master mixture control I
obtained CO of 1.5 %, but moved it up to 2 % to compensate for any
inaccuracy of the gas tester. Spec is 1 to 3 %.

I watched for abnormal dripping inside the carb throats, but it looked
okay. So I will keep an eye on things.

Thanks again for the tips. Did your friend also experience increase in
oil volume due to gasoline entering the crankcase from rich running
conditions?

John

 VW considers the series of short trips that you run in your bus as
 &quot;Severe Operating Conditions&quot;. It's not the carbs it's just that the
 bus is running rich all the time because it isn't warming up properly.
 As a result, you will need to change your oil on a much more regular
 basis. Collie Corner had a similar problem with his 77 bus, and it has
 FI.
