&gt; &gt; Quicky Lube, &quot;High Doktor, this is Fergus at Quicky lube. We got a VW here
&gt; &gt; cause you told the owner the lube was foul in the tranny and needed
&gt; &gt; changing so I found the drain plug and finally got it out with the Vice
&gt; &gt; Grips. I finally found the fill plug but I can't get the Vice Grips on it
&gt; &gt; so can we borrow your spezial tool.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; well at least he got the drain plug out so all the bad fluid was out
&gt; of the box...hey wait...how are they gonna fill it back up :)
&gt;
&gt; mabey that's why you should always make sure you can fill it up before
&gt; draining it.

They would probably stick their pressure-lube gizmo into the drain
opening, block the rest of the hole with their fingers, blast away until
the dial says that something like the proper amount of lube has gone
through the nozzle, and the jam the drain plug back in place before too
much of the fluid drains back out.  Never mind the fluid that dripped into
the drain pan during the process!

That &quot;technician&quot; has to move 20 cars through the place in an hour.  He's
not going to take an extra minute to find a special tool.
