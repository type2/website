&gt; As usual I wanted an opinion from the group on two things. First the PO

&gt; the FI bus am I really doing harm to my bus? Or should I just use high
&gt; octane gas to avoid potential knocking? The head temp usually runs
&gt; around 350 and always has for me.

The EGR was an afterthought to the original design. There's no harm in not
having it there.
