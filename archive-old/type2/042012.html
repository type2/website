Subject: Re: Gen light glows

try checking the battery harness and terminal.  A while back, I couldn't
start my car for months and I couldn't figure out what the problem was. 
I checked everything, wiring, starter, whatever I could think of. 
Changed the battery too and it still wouldn't start.  Then, I looked at
the battery harness and it was all corroded and after that was changed,
it all worked perfectly.

Later,
Mike

&gt; &gt;On my 61, yesterday the generator light started acting up... its wierd.
&gt; &gt;At low RPM's the light is off.  As soon as i get to highway spped its
&gt; &gt;glowing softly.  As soon as the rpms drop, it goes off again.  the bus
&gt; &gt;appears to be charging just fine, its wierd for sure.
&gt; &gt;My only 2 guesses are the brushes in the gen itself are going bad, but
&gt; &gt;that wouldnt explain why it still charges... My other guess is that there
&gt; &gt;is a short in the indicator circuit of the regulator but not the charging
&gt; &gt;circuit...
&gt; &gt;anyone else have any ideas? is this a classic symptom of ____?
&gt; &gt;thanks,
&gt; &gt;Steve
&gt; 
&gt; You're right!  This is a classic symptom of excessive resistance in the
&gt; electrical system.
&gt; The warning light on generator systems compares gen voltage to batt voltage.
&gt; If the gen voltage is low or not there, the light burns bright.
&gt; However, if the batt voltage is lower than gen voltage, the light will glow.
&gt; In your case, I'll bet your gen is charging okay and you have a bad
&gt; connection somewhere
&gt; which is lowering the batt voltage.  Maybe wiring connections, ign switch,
&gt; or the like.
&gt; 
&gt; Hope this helps
