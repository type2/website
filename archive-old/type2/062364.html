&gt; driving from northern Africa to South Africa (sometimes only 80-90 miles
&gt; a day, because of the roughness) in a '63 Kombi. He's got gobs of
&gt; stories to tell of his trip, pictures, advice, etc. He's driven
&gt; apparently everywhere in Europe and most places in Africa in the buss,
&gt; and would love to share his stories.
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone thinks it would be worthwile, I'd be more than happy to put
&gt; some of these pix and stories in readable fashion, and put them on my HP
&gt; or somewhere available.
&gt; 
&gt; If it's something anyone would care to hear about, let me know. I was
&gt; fascinated, and this guy has more hidden knowledge than most I've met.

Yes. I've always enjoyed reading about trips of this type.
