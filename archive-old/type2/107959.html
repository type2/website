Subject: [T2] Doghouse part needed

I'm installing a doghouse in my 70 bay and have collected almost all the
parts including the Hoover bit. What I am missing is the metal piece made
from flat metal that connects the cooling flaps in the fan housing.  This
piece has a larger step in it than the non-doghouse piece (to accommodate
the protruding doghouse).

Anyone have this piece for sale or trade?
