Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Problems

Dean,

Are you getting spark to the spark plugs?  Just pull one of the plug wires 
out of the dizzy and hold it close enough for a spark to jump the gap 
while someone turns it over. 

If you don't have a spark there, it could be your condenser or points.

If you do have a spark there, it's either:
	a) spark plug wires on the wrong plugs: double check this 
		meticulously.  I've had those days where I checked this 
		four times, but on the fifth time, when I was REALLY 
		REALLY looking, I found that I had the wires &quot;crossed&quot;

	b) timing -- not likely, as this didn't change

	c) fuel:
		i) is the fuel line connected/un-plugged
		ii) Is your engine carburated?  
		    Pop off the top of your carb and check that there's fuel 
			in the basin.  
		iii) buy the $18 fuel/vacuum gauge and test your fuel 
			pressure

If it's not the spark, and the timing hasn't changed, it's fuel.  

good luck,
