I noticed there is a &quot;universal&quot; floorpan available for the cargo area of my
Westy, nearest the sliding door area, and then a proper &quot;shaped&quot; replacement
floorpan that goes right along up to the edge of the sliding door inside
sill. Has anyone seen this second panel anywhere and a price for it? My
local supplier just has the rectangular universal one measureing 15&quot; by 58&quot;.
These are made by VENG in Denmark.
Thanks,
Courtney
