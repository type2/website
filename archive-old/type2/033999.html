Kim and others,

The pop-top starts lifting noticeably in the wind on a westy when the
support arms are worn or broken...or when the bolt joining 2 support arms
becomes worn or broken. Before then, the pop-top lifts and falls thousands
of times and you don't notice it...but that's exactly what's wearing out
those support arm parts.

On my Euro-'71 that I sold several years back, it had a little loop and
hook arrangement on the front of the bus. Loop on the bus; hook on the
pop-top. It was positioned so that when I lowered the pop-top, the hook
engaged the loop; this held down the poptop magnificiently.

My '72 Riviera doesn't suffer from the lift problem; I suspect it has
largely to do with the fact of the poptop being aft of the luggage rack.

Have fun! Joe
