&gt;It should; the big question is, can your Bus make it to 88MPH before it runs
&gt;into the side of Twin Pines Mall?


I think the guys with the rocket launcher proved that VW busses can NOT 
make 88 mph in a parking lot that size --- and that VW Busses are strangely 
magnetically attracted to Photo-Bug shops...

Wonder if they used a VW bus because it was automatically slower than the 
star car or because it was cheap?

However - since it was 1985 or so when that was filmed, and that was a late 
sunroof bay - that dang thing wasn't very old when they wrecked it.... What 
a  waste!
