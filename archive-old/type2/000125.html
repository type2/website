Electrical Gurus,

  I m not too swift with my mechanical abilities and clueless with electrical.

 My problems are as follows:
1 When I put the bus in reverse it dies?
2 PO had oil and psi gauge installed and neither works. but the oil psi light 
works coming off a dbl sender
3 I have dual fans by previous P O and bought a salvaged standard fan to 
drive heating system with none of the original wiring. The original fan has 
two wire hookups and a place to plug a large plug into. why all the places to 
plug the original fan into. The guy at the salvage yard refered to the device 
w 3 or 4 prongs as a relay I believe. AM I crazy to try to hook that back up? 
And does anyone know procedure for doing so?
4 When I have the 4 heater slide buttons in the down posistion the light 
comes on on the indicator that has the letter B on it and it wont start in 
that posistion.

5 if you know the answer to one question please advise Im sure this is 
extremly complicated...

 I did not mark the wires that went to the various posts when I dissasembled 
for the rebuild and have hooked up as per what I could make out on my wiring 
diagram.

  Thankyou,
   David
