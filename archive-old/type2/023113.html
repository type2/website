Subject: curtain pattern
Mime-Version: 1.0

volks,

i know many on this list have stated that they have made their own curtains 
using the originals as a pattern.  i, however, do not have the luxury of 
the original curtains....

has anyone ever made a pattern for curtains?  i would really like to make 
my own instead of paying $150 plus for a new set.  is there a web site with 
dimension and such?

thanks in advance...
