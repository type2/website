&gt; I am looking for a bit of advise for the removal of a starter on my 77 bus.
&gt; I only have one bolt left to remove, it is the top bolt and I cant seem to
&gt; locate it. Chilton's states &quot; have a helper hold the nut on the top bolt

because the Chilton is wrong, that information is for the older type I
engine

&gt; underneath the vehicle.&quot; I cant seem to find the nut in the engine
&gt; compartment, and the bolt that I feel on the starter feels round....

right, the bolt head is &quot;D&quot; shaped and locks in, just remove the upper
right motor mount nut, and you have it

remember on a 77 the auto and manual have different starters
