&gt; months.  About 2 months ago, I tightened the clutch cable (the pedal had

&gt; doesn't work, I leave her parked and stuck in Reverse, since the parking
&gt; lot slopes down toward her nose.)  About 1 month ago, I went to start
&gt; her up and couldn't get her out of reverse.  I could push the clutch
&gt; pedal all the way to the floor and not budge the shifter out of reverse.

If you pushed the clutch to the floor, you WERE able to start the bus,
yes?

If so, the clutch is NOT the culprit here.  Transmission related.  If you
tried to start the bus, and all it did was try to move (ie: clutch did not
disengage when pushed...) then I would look at either a frozen clutch
plate, or cable problems, etc..

another check would be to just push the clutch in. No brake. Nose is
downhill, right?  The bus should start rolling.  No? But you can start the
engine? Tranny.  Cant start the engine? clutch. (or both..)


let us know!:)
