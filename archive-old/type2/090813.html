Subject: Hooking up brake servo w/ Dual Webers

Hello,

I have a '72 Westy and I recently upgraded the carbs 
from stock to a set of Weber 40 IDFs.  After hooking 
everything up, I noticed that there wasn't any way to 
connect the brake servo vacuum hoses.  Oddly, I've never 
heard this problem come up before.  But now that I'm 
faced with it, I'm stumped.  
Am I looking at having to drill and tap my new manifolds 
for the new hookup?  If so, I'd like to know the proper 
placing of it on this new style manifold. 

Thanks in advance for any help!
~Steve
