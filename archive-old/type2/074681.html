Subject: Re: [T2] Leaking nipple

[...]

&gt; Got a qestion for you. I did a fuel psi test on my 76 bus 2.0 FI
&gt; and now i've got a leak at the test nipple. my qestion is.. Is there a
&gt; rubber gasket under the hex head bolt? thats on top of the fuel port. I
&gt; didn't notice if there was one when i took it off. But that doesn't mean
&gt; that it wasn't there. right now i've only got a metal to metal seal. It just
&gt; seeps out form underneth the hex head and i don't think that the metal fuel
&gt; line is damaged in anyway. it's just not sealing right. do i need to replace
&gt; to bolt?

You lost the little aluminum seal ring. Look around the tin for it. It will be
tough to find a new one.
