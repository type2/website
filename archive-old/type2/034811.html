&gt;  Does anyone have any suggestions for installing curtains in my bus? The
PO had a really unprofessional/cheesey looking curtain set-up I promptly
removed. Thanks!

Have you had a look at what they sell in your local RV store? Our caravan
(trailer) shop sells all the miniature slider rails and hooks, so if you can
get some curtains sewn up you can make a professional looking job.
