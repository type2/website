Subject: Re: [T2] GBE was GEX

That's pretty much where I'm at now. We have actually been getting more 
enjoyment out of driving at slower bus speeds, but I would like to be able 
to keep up with freeway traffic. When we go with non-VW friends on non-VW 
activities, we can't keep up. It would be nice to pull hills at flow of 
traffic too. But we won't be interested in performance mods that reduce 
engine life.

I used to ask what the HP was, now I want to know about torque vs. rpm and 
how long it lasts... &lt;grin!&gt;
