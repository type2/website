Subject: RE: [T2] BusDepot Website Navigation / Finding Parts

&gt; As I read it, part numbers were all that were accepted
&gt;  so I never considered entering a keyword!


On the beta version of the site, the far-left search box was labeled as both
keyword or part number search. But while it retains that functionality, I
removed the keyword mention from the final version. The reason is that it
has limited usefulness as a keyword search box, since (unlike the main-page
search tool) results are not filtered by vehicle type. For example,
searching keyword &quot;starter&quot; from the far-left search box gives you 390 hits
- every starter component for every VW model!  By comparison,  entering the
same keyword into the main-page search box limits it to those that fit your
Bus, so you get only 12 hits.

On the other hand, the main-page search box is better used for keyword
searching than for part-number searching (although it, too, can do either).
If you search a specific part number from the main page, it filters out
parts that our database doesn't tie to your year - even if only because we
have no application data listed for that part (and in reality it does fit
your year).  Since you already have a part number, you supposedly already
know that the part will fit, even if the busdepot database doesn't. All you
care about is whether we have it. This is where the far-left global search
box comes in more useful, since it searches the entire database. So this is
why I labeled one box as keyword-search and one as part-number search, even
though both can actually search either.

As a rule, I recommend always starting with a keyword search on the main
page (try alternate wording , too, like &quot;gas&quot; if &quot;fuel&quot; doesn't work), and
then moving on to a part number search in the far-left search box only if
the keyword search fails. The problem with searching strictly by part number
is that it won't display alternates that also fit but have a completely
different number (i.e. a Bosch or superceded VW number), some of which may
be better or cheaper than the specific part number you searched.
