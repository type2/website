Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Cylinder head temp?

&gt;I believe that there is a problem with the VDO CHT set-up I'm using.

I believe you are totally correct.

When I worked for germansupply_dot_com I was shocked at the poor quality of CHT 
gauges that we returned to the manufacturer.

We encountered the following problems.

1) Gauges that were reverse wired (black was red: red was black)
2) Gauges that read 100 degrees high
3) Gauges that flat out didnt work

It may of been a run of them that were poor, but the odds are slim.
