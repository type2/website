Subject: Re: [T2] How do Retractable Seatbelts Lock?

About 4 years ago, we were in Indiana at a Phish concert/campout thing. Fun, 
fun, fun, for having a bus, other than having to constantly wonder if junky 
was messing with my van.

Anyhow, I met this lady there, who had a 75 Westy, and we got to talkin'. She 
told me her van ran fine, except that it was making some weird noise for the 
last couple days. I went over to take a look, and I have never seen valves so 
out of adjustment. I grabbed my feelers and fixed her all up. I asked if 
there were any other problems, and she said both of her retractable seatbelts 
weren't working. I told her how cool I thought those were, especially after 
scratching up my front wheelarch with quick jump-outs, haha. We exchanged 
numbers, addresses, etc., and that was that.

About a year later, I got a box in the mail, and it was from her. She said  
she sold the bus, but pulled the seatbelts for me, and that maybe I could fix 
them, but either way, she wanted me to have them.

Well, one of them worked just fine. The other, would not pullout without 
significant force. I looked at, scratched my head, and then went out to the 
garage (wish I still had a garage). On the way there, I dropped it on 
accident. -Picked it up, and went to my tools.

before I attempted to take it apart, I gave it another pull.....eureka! I 
fixed it!......by dropping it.

I don't know much about the inertia do-dad in there, but next time I see one 
that is broke, especially after reading Jim's story, I think I will just drop 
it and see if that fixes it:)
