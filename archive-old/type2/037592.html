Subject: Re: [Type 4 round port exhaust studs]

By stud puller, do you mean one of those sockets with the rollers inside that
grabs the stud when you turn the socket?
That worked for me, but i may have had more stud to work with than you have. 

Hoover said to bake the head at 400 degF for an hour and then pull the stud.
Maybe that would work - the head will be softer.
Of course that means tearing down...
Try the parrafin trick too?

Make sure you clean the head thouroughlly before baking it or you'll smoke
yourself out.

&gt; Hi All
&gt; HELP! Does anyone out there have or know where I can get a stud remover
&gt; for stripped Type 4 round port exhaust studs. Three out of 4 aint bad
&gt; but the fourth broke off with about 3/4 &quot;
&gt; left sticking out. I have tried the hammer and penetrating oil tricks
&gt; but it still broke off. No regular stud puller will work, too large n
&gt; diameter. Please tell me that there is some way short of drilling it
&gt; out.
&gt; Thanks, O brilliant listees, Jack
