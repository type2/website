Subject: Re: [T2] which hubcap on a 72?

They were the &quot;flattish&quot; variety (they are still very slightly &quot;domed&quot;
shaped,) common to 71-79 Type 2s, 80-91 Vanagons, 68-79 Bugs, 66-73 Type 3.

They are still sold at VW under the current part number 251 601 151 A, most
likely made in Mexico by Hella.  Some aftermarket places sell them under the
same part number, some under the older part number 311 601 151 D.  The 251
601 151 A variety at the vertical base portion is a tad bit taller to
account for and clear the longer rear axle stub of the Type 2 and Vanagon.

Best thing to do is find a good used set of original German ones for the
better chrome.

&gt; folks,
&gt; i am piecing together my 72 bus. Which were the
&gt; correct hubcaps for that year? Were they the
&gt; pronounced domed ones like ca. 1967 bugs or more of
&gt; the flat'ish ones like  the ca. 1970 bugs? I don't
&gt; have enough of either to make a set so need to know
&gt; which variety to further source.
&gt; anybody got a complete set of teh correct ones for
&gt; sale?
