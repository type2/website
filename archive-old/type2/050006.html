Assuming you have what I think is the correct distributor for the year 
of your bus, this would be a dual (vac &amp; centrifugal) advance 
distributor, with a dual diaphragm vacuum can (advance and retard).  
It's possible that your vacuum can is bad and/or the breaker points 
mounting plate in the dizzy is sticking.  Also, a bad vacuum retard hose 
could be at fault.  My 71 has the same (or similar) dizzy  (on a 1600 dp 
engine), and a bad vacuum can was the cause for a similar problem I was 
having.  I replaced the can, and the engine behaved nicely after that.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; We've a rather bizarre symptom occurring on our 72 bus.
&gt; 
&gt; When we are driving it feels as if the accel cable is sticking.
&gt; You take your foot off the pedal, and the bus keeps going, sometimes
&gt; actually speeding up.
&gt; 
&gt; If you step on the clutch, at best it idles too high, at worst roars at high
&gt; rpm, regardless how fast you were going.
&gt; 
&gt; The only way to stop it is either to jab the accel pedal, or smoothly &quot;floor
&gt; it&quot; and let off, and then it will idle down.
&gt; 
&gt; We greased the accel linkage, with no difference.
&gt; 
&gt; Any suggestions.  1982 T4 motor, with dual 34 carbs.  I know they are not
&gt; quite in sync, but it runs smooth, and gets 22 mpg.
