Subject: Re: idle problem in 73 dual carb

so im not the brightest light on the ferris
wheel:).....anyways i appreciate all the advice i
receive on this great list.   heres the update, went
to my local flaps and bought some rubber hose and
clamps, and proceeded to replace all old cruddy vacuum
lines and clamp them down, screwed the main idle screw
OUT:), but lizzy stiil refuses to idle.   if you rev
the engine, it will come down to a normal idle, hang
out for about 1 to 2 seconds and drop down to barely
running then stall.   when i go to work on the highway
about 12 miles, once i reach the parking lot it will
idle barely at about 4-500 rpm.   what am i missing
here?
TIA

&gt; &gt;good wires and plugs.   on the carbs the main idle
&gt; &gt;adjustment screw is turned all the way in.   any
&gt; ideas
&gt; &gt;on what i should look for, man i hate carbs!
&gt; 
&gt; Much as I dislike helping carb haters :-) have you
&gt; tried turning the main
&gt; idle screw OUT?  That's the way it needs to go to
&gt; increase idle.
