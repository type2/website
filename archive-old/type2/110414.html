Subject: Re: [T2] horn no beep

Hiya Ian,

There is a phenomenally well hidden (and very difficult to get to) connection 
for the horn at the end of the steering column.  It's hidden on the underside 
of the bus in the baseplate (which from the underside looks like an inverted 
cup) for the steering column.  It's a male spade connector positioned at the 
front (as in front of bus) of that baseplate.  You cannot see it without a 
small mirror, and you cannot touch it unless you are a heck of a contortionist.  
This THE ONE to check first.  
If, indeed, you do not have a connection, then you are in for some work.  
This is a very do-able job.  It just takes both time and patience.
