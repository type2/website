Subject: Uh Oh...

Hi volks,
          Well, I finally found the problem that's been causing my '77 Devon to run
rough for the past few weeks. Once of the rubber connectors on the balancing tube
between the carburettor inlets was cracked and leaking.

 Question is, how much collateral damage has been caused along the way- when
I checked compression last night I got 145/140/0... oops. I reset the valves
on #3 and got 90psi back- so I'm currently running at 145/140/90/140.

 My suspicion is that I've burnt the exhaust valve on #3. Does this sound
likely? Are there other possibilities?

 I'm hoping that it's just a seating problem and will clear itself with
a little bedding in but I think I'm clutching at straws with that.. :-(

 Top end rebuild time?

Cheers,
        W.
