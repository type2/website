&gt;Subject: i need help............
&gt;
&gt;i am desperate..and need help......i have a 72 westy 1700motor that i knew was
&gt;bad and was trying to make it last.  well finally it died and i have already
&gt;pulled the engine ( same day) and have started the rebuild ( which you know is
&gt;not real cheap on some bus motor parts)...anyways a friend said he would loan
&gt;me a spare turn-key 1600 dp motor out of a bug...to use until my rebuild was
&gt;finished...( this is my only transportation)...i need to find some one who has
&gt;done it to see what is involved or is it an straight forward swap.  1700 motor
&gt;is a 210 mm flywheel.....bug is 200.  that is the only problem i can see.
&gt;otherwise the bug motor should bolt right up to the bus tranny.   please
&gt;advise or send me to a web site that has this info.....i have been searching
&gt;all morning on this computer.    thanks for the help.!!!!!!
&gt;
