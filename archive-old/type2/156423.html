Subject: Re: [T2] brake drums

&gt; What size is the nut on the end of the rear wheel on my 78?  It's
&gt; the funky one with the pin through it.

46mm, it's called a castellated nut.

3/4&quot; Drive bar w/ correct socket (borrow from vwflaps?) is prefered method to
lame-o cheapy hammer tool sold by vw-mag suppliers.

I think 1-13/16&quot; is closest American, check archives.

&gt; WIll the drum come off with
&gt; the aid of a bead blow hammer

I prefer BFH brand.  Shouldn't need a puller, penetrant and hammer blows
should do it.

Billy
