best one I've had was the zip tied broken fuse block, after replaceing it
all kinds of things started to work again ; )
This one might have had an excuse, its a one year only part. A lot of the
other stuff you find tho falls into the 'never enough time to do it right,
but always enough time to do it over' school of mechanics.

&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt;
&gt; Having followed this thread from the beginning, I wanted to weigh in with
a
&gt; few observations.  It seems to me that laziness, lack of money, lack of
&gt; knowledge, and lack of vision all contribute to why people can't fix
things
&gt; right.  Here's how I see it:
&gt;
&gt; Lack of Vision:  &quot;I needed a car, and my neighbor had this old 1960s VW
Bus
&gt; in his backyard, so I bought it for $200.  I don't know much about cars,
and
&gt; I hear these things need a lot of work, but it runs.  I'll drive it as
long
&gt; as I can, and buy something else when it dies.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Lack of Knowledge:  &quot;What do those red lights on my dash mean?  I never
got
&gt; an owner's manual, and the PO said they were supposed to be on when the
&gt; engine's on.  You mean I have to change the oil?  But it's air-cooled!&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Lack of Money:  &quot;Why buy a new wiring harness for $150 when I can buy a
&gt; 100-foot spool of wire at Radio Shack for $10?  I'll just replace the
wires
&gt; that need fixing, and it'll work okay until something else breaks.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Laziness:  &quot;I was going to fix the rust on my rockers last weekend, but it
&gt; was raining, and the game was on, and then I got high, and by the time I
&gt; woke up from my nap it was dark.  Besides, VW made these things pretty
good
&gt; anyway, so I can still drive it and fix the rust next summer.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; If we're unfortunate enough to come across a Bus that has had POs with
these
&gt; lines of thinking, those of us who care about these great machines can get

&gt; frustrated.  On the other hand, if we understand what we're doing to our
&gt; Buses (for better or for worse) and are up-front with buyers at sale time,
&gt; we only have ourselves to blame for future bad VW karma.  I've been guilty
&gt; of all of the above infractions (on all of my cars), but I'm only human.
&gt;
&gt; Best of luck to all who love, fix, and maintain these great old cars.
