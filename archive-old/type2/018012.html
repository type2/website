Subject: Any listees in greater Monterey CA?
Message-ID: &lt;373C3154.8A97A7E2_at_mindspring_dot_com&gt;

Hello, 
I am moving the last week of May to the greater Monterey Bay area of
California. I am wondering if there any list members living in that part
of the world? I have a bunch of questions, and if you do live in that
area and don't mind an email from me with these questions please respond
to me via private email. Thanks,
Scoob
