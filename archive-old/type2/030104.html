&gt; 1) does the type3 oil cooler match the same mounting as the normal

AFAIK type III coolers are the same as type 1 except for the oil pressure
sender hole.  (hmmm, this might be a good place for a temp sensor?)

Now, the type IV coolers are the same about the mounting surface and are
wider.  You need to mod the tin to use them, but it might be worth it.

&gt; 3) how much do you think the dual kadrons (or generally increased fuel 
&gt; flow)
&gt; 	helps the cooling?

If you want it cool, richen the mixture.  However, we would be a bit
disappointed by the mileage.
