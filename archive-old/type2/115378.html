Subject: On removing clothes closet...solved

Thanks to Alex Wisniewski and James Hen. for their suggestions on where to 
find the top bracket that holds the closet in place: right next to the rear 
hatch hinge hidden from view.  Duh! Any now its out, in about 15 minutes 
(fortunately no ceiling cabinet came with this Westy, which would have made 
for a harder job). So now we can load that double bed box and mattress with 
no cabinet obstruction. Once again the practicality of the Van is 
demonstrated.
