Subject: [T2] 71 Transporter to Camper Endeavor

Hello List

I just recently bought a '71 Transporter up here in Maine.  It had an engine
rebuild about 15k miles ago, and a new transmission at about the same time.
The engine runs great, and the body isn't too bad (two rotted rocker arms,
and the darn plague of rust on the door.  Anyway, I am in the process of
having the body work done, as well as the necessary tweaks and fixes that I
need to get it inspected (this also includes new balljoints and tierods in
the front end).
My question is this: I am interested in trying to copy (somewhat, mind you)
the interior of a camper.  I am not going to go as far as to put a pop-top
on Nigel (that is what my son calls him), but do envision myself perhaps
taking him and my son camping.  Any resources out there that my assist me in
such a project?  The first thing I would like to do is equip him with a
heater.  Anyplace online have these for sale?  I live in a very small town
in Maine, and am pretty much out in the woods, far from civilization, so
mail order is pretty much what I'm looking for.

Anyway, I am glad to be here, and do appreciate any help/input that anyone
has on this.

Thanx,
Kyle Pendleton
