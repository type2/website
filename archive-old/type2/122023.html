Subject: Re: [T2] time to replace engine

Hi Rob,

You can easily swap a 1.8L and 2L engine. I did the same thing last 
summer, but from 1.8 to 2L. The main issue is how you define &quot;easy&quot;.  
If it's your first engine drop, you're in for a lot of learning. But if 
you're prepared to scrape a knuckle or two you can make it happen. It's 
certainly NOT a bad idea.

If you're getting a COMPLETE engine with intake tin and exhaust you 
will be a long way ahead. Much will depend on how complete the 1.8L 
engine is, because that tells you how much stuff you need to swap over 
from the 2L: Exhaust, tin, fan shroud, alternator, intake system, etc. 
You want to be take the time out to consider which engine has the 
better components: if you replaced your alternator last year, it makes 
more sense to use it rather than the unknown quantities installed in 
your free engine.

Even with a free engine, you could still be looking at 10 or more hours 
labour to complete the swap. Knowing that, be sure to get a leak-down 
test done on the 1.8L engine and have the end-play checked before you 
put too much time into it. A few bucks spent up-front could save a lot 
of grief later.

In 1974 the Federal 1.8L engine had dual carbs with air-injection ports 
in the heads, and a mechanical fuel pump on the block.The heads have no 
head-temp sensor hole in them.  If you're running stock FI then you 
will need to drill and tap a new hole in the 3/4 head. The fuel pump 
will need to be replaced with a block-off plate. Otherwise you should 
be fine. If it's a 1975 1.8L or 74 Cal-spec engine then you are pretty 
much set to go, as that year was already fuel injected.

According to the Bentley there was little difference in power between 
the 1.8 and 2L. The Bosch L-Jet FI system sets the mixture based on 
air-flow, so if your engine is pulling 10% less air it will reduce the 
fuel accordingly. If you're running with carb(s) you will want to rejet 
them.

The only other major difference is that the 1.8L originally had solid 
lifters, where your 78 has hydraulics. As long as you keep them 
inspected regularly that won't be a problem.

Happy trails,

&gt; Hi all:
&gt;
&gt; My 2 liter 78 Campmobile may need a new engine. I'll find out next 
&gt; week.
&gt;
&gt; A 1.8 liter engine has become available (Free!)  Can I use it to 
&gt; replace the 2.0, or is this a bad idea? Would it be unduly difficult? 
&gt; Would the camper be too too underpowered?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks.
