Subject: Loose instrument panel glass

&gt; The glass that covers my speedometer and idot lights is very loose, so I
&gt; removed my instrument panel to try to find the cause. Looks as though there
&gt; may have been rubber seals in here at one time and they have rotted out.  Can
&gt; anyone confirm this or explain the cause and correction.  If seals need
&gt; replaced where can I get them?

--&gt;  I had the glass over my fuel gauge/idiot light cluster come loose in
my '75.  The rattling drove me nuts until I took it apart.  Mine looked
like it had originally been held in with little plastic hooks (broken) and
glue.  I just stuck it back in with RTV, and trimmed off any that showed
after it dried.  It's not the prettiest way to do it, but it doesn't
rattle now.

The culprit here, I think, was me constantly tapping the glass to free up
a sticky fuel gauge needle. ;)
