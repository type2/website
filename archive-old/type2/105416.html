&gt; How 'bout a bare breasted female figure, as found on the front of olden
&gt; sailing ships?
&gt; Used to tame the sea, perhaps it would have a similar effect on traffic???

The figurehead idea isn't bad [grin], but I'd have to stay away from the
bare breasts theme because of our company policies...

... and because of the fact that it would cause more accidents than it's
worth.  It'd be on the IP/AP news feed, and probably CNN, inside of a month.
