&gt;I stand corrected. You are right , my friend.  I now remember seeing an orange
&gt;'73 westy that had that beigeish almost-the-same-color-as-the-vinyl, &quot;burlap&quot;
&gt;upholstry on the camping components. Quite a repulsive interior, indeed.  And ,

Ok, I always hear people dissing that material and I must say in its
defense, I much prefer the breathability of the burlap/cloth over the sweaty
naugahyde on hot days!
