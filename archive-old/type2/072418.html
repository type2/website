If you have a good trailer hitch there is a product that mounts to that and picks the front wheel of the bike off the ground and leaves the rear wheel supporting a good portion of the weight of the bike. http://www.bike-hiker_dot_com/

When I got married my wife and I spent two months in a rusty 78 Camper with 115K on it. First bus I owned, bought it 2 weeks before we left, didn't know a thing about it, fortunately only had wiring problems over the 12K trip. Everyone I talked to didn't know what to do with the FI when it acted up, even the VW dealers. Most wanted to put carbs on it. Got hooked on VWs though.

10 years later I have a 78 Camper from Tennessee, a toddler and another kid on the way. Just finished going through the whole brake system. Replaced every single fuel line a couple years ago. Have a complete set of spares from a parts van, even engine and tranny. Know more then I ever wanted to about FI. I know if I am on the road I can fix almost anything that might go wrong or at least advise a mechanic with the proper tools. I would rather have my spare engine shipped to me by a freind then have a mystery engine installed on the road.

Good luck Hempster, one last piece of advice, don't get to caught up in a schedule. VW buses are not good for making deadlines, they are good for making journeys, stop and smell the roses :-)
