I see no reason why you would have had to evacuate the A/C.  You should be 
able to remove the compressor from the engine and set it in the left-hand 
battery tray area.  If I recall, there are four bolts that hold the 
compressor to the bracket that can be accessed from below.  I know, not 
much good if you've already evacuated it.  :-(  2nd opinions are always 
good before you do something expensive.

&gt;Here's the problem.  The bolts for the bracket that carries the rear engine
&gt;support bar is only 1 inch away from the AC compressor.  Do I have to remove
&gt;the compressor to pull the engine or is it possible to remove the bolts that
&gt;go through the support bar instead of the ones that attach the bracket to
&gt;the frame?  Is this clear, it's hard to put the description in text.  Has
&gt;anyone removed a late model, type 4, AC equipped engine before?

Absolutely clear.  Yes, you can (and should) remove the bolts that hold the 
bar to the bracket rather than those that hold the bracket to the 
frame.  It's easier that way.

Good luck and please post if you have any more questions.
