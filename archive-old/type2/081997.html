Subject: Re: [T2] cylinder head temp sender location


&gt;  As I was writing to him, it occurred to me
&gt; that the air injection ports on the 1700 heads might be an ideal location
&gt; for a cylinder head temp sender.  Has anyone tried this?  I have only
&gt; owned 2L engines and have no experience with the 1700 engines or heads,
&gt; but if you could find the proper sender, those ports look like they reach
&gt; way down toward the cumbustion chambers.  Is this true?

I don't think this would work. You would be reading exhaust temperature. It
will probably burn away the end of the sender!
