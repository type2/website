Subject: Searching for Curtains

I'm looking for original curtains for 71 Westy, the ones with the brown, yellow
and checkerboard pattern.  Will buy sections in good condition.  Will buy the
camper privacy section that goes over the windshield.

Any leads to whom might have any would be appreciated.
