Subject: Heater

Why not just remove the flex hoses that connect the heat exchangers to the under bus heat piping?  When the weather/season changes you can pop them back on...

In my experience, the flapper valves/diverters inside the HEs don't seal all that well when the HEs are brand new.  You've probably done all you can with cable adjustments, etc.

By the way, in most [maybe all] the US states it's illegal to drive barefoot for safety reasons.  Haven't any idea what the regulations might be in Australia, but I expect they are more lenient than ours...

====================================
&gt;&gt;
Does anyone have any suggestions on how to shut the heaters off tightly?
