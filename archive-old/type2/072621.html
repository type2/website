Subject: venting valve covers
Message-Id: &lt;v01510107b36d050c080b_at_[207.172.52.122]&gt;

A number of people responded to tell me that the two inlet ports on my berg
breather box were to be connected to the valve covers.

I've often heard of doing this but have never understood the theory of
this.  What purpose does this serve?

thanks
