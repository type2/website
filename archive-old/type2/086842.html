&gt; Hello Type 2 List:
&gt; 
&gt; I just pulled the engine, got the firewall off
&gt; to clean my gas tank which I am suspicious of....
&gt; 
&gt; Well, all ok so far but I was stymied by the 13mm bolts
&gt; holding the metal bands that go over the tank--they are frozen
&gt; big time.  I was twisting them, heard some nasty sounds up above
&gt; and then finally realized I was twisting up the band itself!
&gt; I put a couple of turns in it before I stopped.
&gt; 
&gt; There doesnt seem to be any way to lock the tops of these bolts down.
&gt; I cannot seem to unfreeze them and am way too chicken to use a torch
&gt; in that area.  It seems hard to getliquid wrench on an upside down bolt.
&gt; 
&gt; I am tempted to just cut them and replace them with some metal webbing.
&gt; Is this a bad idea?  It might very well be a bad
&gt; idea as I have no concept at all
&gt; how they attach on the other side.
&gt; 
&gt; Any other suggestions?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
