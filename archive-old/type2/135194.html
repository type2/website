It's the cooling boot that is NLA not the alternator. Ron has Bosch rebuilt 
70amp units. Ventura Group is reproducing the 50amp boot but not the 70amp.

&gt; Guys,
&gt;
&gt; I've been thinking about the 70 amp alternator too and went and looked
&gt; yesterday at the autozone site.
&gt;
&gt; Autozone claims to have one...special order and all, but it is on their
&gt; web site.
&gt;
&gt; So what's up with that?  Ron(BD) doesn't list one, but the bus-boys
&gt; do...are they &quot;really&quot; NLA, or am I just dreaming.....Think I'll call them
&gt; in a few minutes when they open and ask them.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers, dave
