Hi Volks,
Thanks again to the mighty List for suggestions on my brake problem, pedal
to the floor the first time but a few pumps got a firm high pedal. A tip of
my dunce cap to the folks that suggested checking adjustment on the shoes
again.  The problem seemed to go back to adjustment of the front wheel
bearings.  When I jacked up the front wheels I noticed excessive wobble in
the wheel.  Evidently upon adjusting the new bearings, I turned the nut just
until the washer barely moved (Muir method).  But the bearings never set
into their races.  I turned the bearing nut in till snug, setting the
bearing, then back out to set the end play.  I was getting a false binding
when adjusting the shoes.  I was able to adjust the stars in at least 10
clicks before binding the wheel.  BTW, the Haynes manual was by far the best
of the big HMB three in illustrating exactly how to turn the stars on each
wheel to tighten the shoes, no guesswork.  Hopefully my stumbling will help
someone someday.
