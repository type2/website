Subject: Re: [T2] Bumper replacement

Why extend?
I would need to reinforce the existing bumper or add on an under
reciever.. Given I don't have a stock exaust thats just more work.

----Original Message Follows----

 &gt; when you you could just hang a receiver to accommodate a bike rack under
 &gt; the stock bumper.


or even just extend the stock bumper on longer mounting brackets.
