Subject: From EFI to carbs

Hi All, 

Before the flames begin, let me say that I have nothing against fuel
injection.  The EFI on my bus has server very well since it rolled out
of the factory.  But I'm rebuilding an engine, and have gone a little
more &quot;performance&quot; [snicker] with the engine.  94mm flat topped P&amp;C,
36x42 HeadFlow Masters heads, and a European Motorworks &quot;E&quot; grind cam.
The moving parts will be getting a .5 gram balance at a local machinist
experienced with the Type 4 engine.  

My question concerns the wiring.  I've never done an EFI to Carbs swap
on a bus before.  I know that the double relay and resistor pack goes
away, as does the brain.  But how I need to alter the existing wiring
harness, I don't know.  I'm looking over the wiring diagram, and it
makes sense, but my woeful knowlege of the type 2 electrical system is a
hole I'd rather not fall into blindly.  But rest assured, I won't just
go attack the wiring harness with a set of side cutters and &quot;figure it
out later&quot;   

At the moment, all I've done is removed the engine.  All the wiring is
still in place sans the EFI harness that came out with the engine.  

Anybody care to share from the voice of experience?  

Thanks!

Shad H.
