Subject: Re: [T2] Installed my stereo yesterday

Don, if you haven't chewed into your door panels yet, please consider 
placing the speaker in the kick plare in front of your feet.

I got inexpensive 5 1/4&quot; speakers and they fit the lower outside corner 
areas of both kick plates.  You need the smaller and shallower types.

It is easier to get replacement kick plates than replacement door panels!!

(you can construct some if you wish from 3mm paneling.  they may need be cut 
a bit smaller at the tops to bend in.  I experimented with some styrofoam 
sheets to prove it would work before I cut my kick plates.)

Forget about sound quality.  You are interested in something that puts out 
more noise than the engine...  Something that will cover the sound of your 
tight valves...
