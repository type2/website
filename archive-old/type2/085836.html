Subject: Re: [T2] head temperature sensor

Matt,

My 77 seems to have a get home mode. That is it will start and run (poorly) 
with the intake air sensor multi pin connector pulled off. It runs real rich 
with a fair amount of black smoke. How does your bus react to this condition 
with the head sensor hooked up.
