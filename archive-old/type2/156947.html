&gt;   Hi All,
&gt;
&gt; I recently replaced the points in my 81 vanagon westy. The points did
&gt; not come with the little capsule of grease like they used to, and I am
&gt; sorry to say that I forgot to put some on them after installing and
&gt; timing the engine. By the end of my camping trip they were toast, the
&gt; engine would break up if I tried to rev to high and had lousy
&gt; acceleration. What kind of lubrication should I use when I install the
&gt; next set?

A good VWFLAPS will carry Bosch distributor point grease in a little
yellow and black tube.  One tube will last a very long time.  The grease
is very thick and stays put on the cam.  I also use it for clutch pilot
bearings.

George
