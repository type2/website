&lt;&lt; In all, I probably spent about $3500. I did a full teardown and rebuild
of the Corvair engine. If one found a engine and tranny on good
condition, one could probably do the swap themselves for maybe $2500. It
all depends on getting lucky on the parts. There's a pretty large
Corvair enthusiasts group out there. Parts and support are a-plenty
(.... but not as a-plenty as those VW nuts)
