Subject: ] Re: Junk oil filters

I use the Mahle filters but unfortunately my oil filter wrench doesn't work
on it very well.  It was designed for the fram or whatever else.  Has anyone
found a good for one the Mahle.  And I put it on hand tight.  But this last
one backed off on me on the way home form the last campout about 2 months
after I put it on.  Scared the crap out of me when the smoke started pouring
out of the heat vents and saw oil dripping from all over the engine.  Once
it cooled down it was just hand tighten top off the oil and go.

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
