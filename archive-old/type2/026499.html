I just wanted to get in my 2 cents worth on this one:  The Porsche Club guys
I hang out with say that if you use the SS brake lines (there are DOT and
non-DOT approved ones - don't even THINK about using the non-DOT ones!) that
you should replace them every few years.  

At $60 a set that doesn't seem like a very good deal to me.  Not when I can
buy a set of OEM German rubber ones for a few bucks less and use them for
20+ years!

If you replace your 30 year old rubber lines with new SS lines, you WILL
notice a difference in your brake pedal!  But not because of the lines.  The
difference will be because you're replacing old, worn out lines with new
ones and you're bleeding all the old fluid and air out of your brakes.  You
will notice the SAME difference if you replace your old lines with new OEM
rubber ones.

Hey, they were good enough to last for 30 (or more?) years, why not replace
them with the same.
