Subject: Re: [T2] firming shift linkage, 71 bus

Denny,
You may also want to take a look at your pin in the shifter ball for
excessive wear, and the slot in the forward shift rod, too.  It shouldn't
have a round spot worn in the middle of the slot.  I replaced all my
bushings and rear fork while my gearbox was out of my bus for overhaul, but
I think that the biggest difference was in replacing the shifter lever and
front shift rod, as my shifter's ball had flat spots, and the spring loaded
pin in the shifter's ball and the little slot where it fit into (in the
forward shift rod) was excessively worn. I found a good used unit (shift
lever and forward rod) at a local wrecker and scooped it up, now the bus
shifts like a new vehicle, with no &quot;rotary slop&quot;.

Cheers,
Drew

&gt; I'd like to remove as much slop from my shift linkage as is practical w/o
&gt; removing the tranny.
&gt; Perusing the Bentley, library, and archives, it seems that the front
bushing
&gt; and the rear coupling are fairly straightforward to replace now.
&gt; Sounds like the 2 nylon bushings on the rear shaft cannot be changed w the
&gt; tranny in.
&gt; This is how I understand it, tho any comment if this is indeed true,
&gt; suggestions, or elaboration would be appreciated.
&gt; Any other replacement parts or procedures while I'm at it?
&gt; TIA
&gt; Denny Johnson
