Subject: [T2] Need resources for 78 camper

Hi all,

I'm Peter in Portland, OR, USA

I would like to know if anyone has any reccomondations for the following:

1. What's the best manuel for '78 campers?  I have the Idiot's Guide and it really seems to be tailored to earlier busses....anything that has pics of my style pop-top (straight-up top)?

2. Are there any good online companies that sell reasonable interior kits (upholstery kits, curtains, etc.)?  

3.  Any good Internet resources for Campers only?

Thanks for any help you can provide!

Best regards,
Peter
