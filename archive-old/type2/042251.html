Subject: valve springs

Hello.

In converting a '77 solid lifter head (donor engine) into a '78 hydraulic 
lifter head (target engine, MUST I change the valve springs??

I noticed that the valve springs are different in RMMW catalog, so should I 
buy new springs??

I guess the question is, what is the diffrence between solid lifter and 
hydraulic lifter valve springs.
