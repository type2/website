This weekend, I had a chance to install one of the louvered window seal kits
that I recently purchased from Wolfsburg West.  This kit is a new item they
are offering and includes the frame to body, glass to frames, and frame to
window frame seals.  I think it was $25 or so.

The rubber is the same gray color as the originals and fit very well.  There
are a few tough spots to overcome in regards to getting some of the old
seals out.  The window manufacturer &quot;pinched&quot; the channel at each end of the
seal retainer tracks to hold the seal in place and this needs to be opened
up to get the old out and the new in.  In most cases this was not too
difficult; a thin bladed screwdriver tapped into the end of the channel is
enough to open it up.  In one instance, however, the channel has been
punched instead of pinched and this was a bit more difficult to overcome as
the distortion was more severe and required that the dimple left in the
channel be cut out.

All in all, I highly recommend this kit.  I have to do the other side yet,
but expect it to go even more smoothly.
