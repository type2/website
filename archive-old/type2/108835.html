~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I believe the 4.5 and .08 are the resistance value in K ohms of the resister in the rotor. Although .08 is
very low.  You might also measure the length of the metal on top of the rotor, from the centerwhere the carbon
button rides to the end where it meets the contacts in the cap. Newer ones are shorter to get the spark to
jump a wider gap.....

This is one of the reasons why VW's do not run very well with resister spark plugs. Those brown spark plug
wire ends that are on every VW/Bosch wire set are also resisters. Pull one off and read the bottom edge.
Surprise! 14K ohm......    Add 4.5K and 14K and you get 18.5K to each cylinder. Now add the resistance value
of a resister plug, around 10K, and you will wonder how the plug even fires at idle much less under a load.
Try replacing the wires with a carbon core wire [common fix for radio static] instead of the solid wire core
and put in resister plugs..... you will kill the battery trying to start it! You will have all three things
you need: fuel, compression, and spark. But that spark when it finally gets to the end of the plug will be so
weak.....
