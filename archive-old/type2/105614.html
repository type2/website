&gt; 1) how difficult is it to repair tear/rot damage in the
&gt; canvas? (like many too poor to replace..)
***there are MANY creative ways to repair/replace a poptop if you have
little money.
***someone once said they bought a used tent from a boyscout sale or army
navy surplus, or just a camping place that was selling out of a
particular model/style tent... they cut it up, using the old poptop
canvas as a pattern, sewed it back together and installed it...
***a friend of mine offered to send me a nylon tent to use, like i
described above...
***using bandanas or walmart cloth placemats to cover holes... merely
cosmetic, obviously...
***buy netting/screen material and make your poptop completely out of
that... MUCH cheaper than canvas. you can always install velcro along the
top and sew the other half of the velcro to the back of some cheap
material or even towels to add privacy...
***there is also a product called &quot;heat 'n bond&quot;... you iron it on to the
back of one fabric, remove the paper backing and iron it to what you want
to bond it to... that would alleviate any sewing that may weaken the old
fabric as someone else pointed out... it is also handy for the sewing
impaired... LOL
***i am sure there are other ways, but i dont remember any others i have
heard at this time... at any rate, that should give you a few ideas to
get ya started.

... 3)It had the hinged table, bit all hardware was removed for
&gt; replacement and lost? is it available? I have the wood, and
&gt; mount, but no hinges or the other parts
***mine (1970) appears to be a &quot;piano hinge&quot;
 
... 6)what is suggested to rejuvinate the fiberglass top?
&gt; should it be re-gel-coated? it's kinda getting fuzzy
***they sell a fiberglass repair kit at the hardware store, or you may
ask boat people what they recommend. if you just want to make it less
blackened, try bleach/water. my friend suggested that and it worked GREAT
on mine... you can still see where i cleaned it and where i stopped. i
would definitely recommend bleaching it before you apply anything over
it, or the blackness may seep through.

I HOPE I WAS OF SOME HELP!!! (or at least entertainment)
