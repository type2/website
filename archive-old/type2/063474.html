Subject: RE: Don't try this at home

BTDT, but I only got about 5 miles from home before loosing the wheel, which got
scarred up from the inside of the wheel well, but managed to find all the lug
nuts.  Even reused the tires on the '64 I bought after the '75 committed
suicide.

I will admit it wasn't fun sitting half way into the center island during
morning rush hour trying to get the nuts back onto the munged up threads, but it
all worked out and no serious damage was done.
