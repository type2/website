&gt; If the Virginia DMV won't accept the form, then your friend will have to
&gt; mail it with the proper payment and (IMPORTANT) the return address to mail
&gt; the title (still commonly called the &quot;pink slip&quot;, but they haven't been
pink
&gt; for over a decade now).  To contact the Calif DMV call (800)777-0133 if
your
&gt; friend has other questions or go to:
&gt;
&gt;
   And if that aint enough to make you flip your lid
   There's one more thing, I got the pink slip, Daddy
                                      -Little Deuce Coupe (you don't know
what I got... ;-)

   And in &quot;Two Lane Blacktop&quot;, James Taylor (&quot;Driver&quot;) and Dennis Wilson
(&quot;Mechanic&quot;), in their primered '55 Shoebox race Warren Oates (&quot;GTO&quot;)
from sea to shining sea for &quot;pinks&quot;... ;-)
