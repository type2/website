Subject: Re: [T2] 79 Riviera Tune Up problems continue

What I would check are two things.

1. See if the distributer shaft is warn, check by removing rotor and with
your fingers wiggle it back and forth.  If you feel play, you need to
replace the distributer.  A warn shaft will make the spark jump and can
cause mis firing.

2.  Make sure the cylinder head temp sensor is tight on #3 cylinder and
make sure the wire connector is also tight and not frayed.


&gt;Basically it misses at certain rpm's through each gear.. for example, in 3rd
&gt;gear it will consistently miss in the 33 to 38 mph range.  My timing is
&gt;currently set at 7.5 .  It is a 1979 California edition, but I do not
&gt;believe it has the 79 engine installed (no hydraulic lifters).
&gt;
&gt;Besides the timing, here is a list of what else has been replaced in the
&gt;last week.
&gt;
&gt;Spark Plugs / wires
&gt;cap
&gt;rotor
&gt;fuel/oil/air filters
&gt;points
&gt;condenser
&gt;
&gt;Any other idea of what I can change or check?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks again everyone,
&gt;Nick
