Subject: Re: [T2] vac dizzy help on 71 1600 dp...

&gt;1-4-3-2 CCW is the order of the distributor wires starting from the rotor 
&gt;facing the notch on the body.

Great. I get idiot of the day on the type 2 list.

I was using Muirs diagram in the back of the book. The diagram doesn't have 
it that way (it has it hooked up 1, 2,3 ,4)  but the text is correct.

That would explain why it's running so poor but doesn't explain why vacuume 
thingy doesn't move when I suck.
