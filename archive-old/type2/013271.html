He did apparently get the email to the list. He refunded me the $73. 
And i got a very rude response calling a few 4 letter words and
demanding an apology for defamed his character.

To which I would like to respond. I did try to contact Mr Reeves several
times via email, which apparently he does read, with no response. I did
not ask for a refund because I didn't want one, I would much rather have
the parts. He told me the parts where shipped once when i reached him on
the phone, on a number he did not give me but i found out though
investigation. Repeated requests for a tracking number where ignored. He
did not contact me when the parts where allegedly returned to him for
unknown reasons. Or to any of 5 other emails asking where these parts
where. 

I will not be apologizing to Mr Reeves. I believe that I held up my end of
the transaction with payment  within the hour payment for the parts, and
i believe that Mr Reeves did not by refusing to respond after the money
was transfered.

If you have the time and are interested, judge for yourself, I have
chronicled every email, postal mail and phone call with Mr Reeves on my
web page at 
http://zoser.mammoth_dot_org/parts/

On that note, that is all i have to say. 
We can probably kill this thread. Flames on the subject should be directed
at the aproprit party, Me or Mr Reeves. (or a your nearest brick
wall, if that pleases you)  Each of you can desided whether
you would like to do business with Mr Reeves by reviewing the facts. 

And I would like to thank the list, The fear of being outed by 1000+  type
2 drivers has returned my $73 to me.
