Subject: Re: [T2] auxiliary air regulator help

I'm ready for the incoming flack on this one.
I just spray mine down with rust remover, Liquid Wrench or some such.
Most times I just find vacuum leaks are the problem not hardware.
Yes your pictures look right, the notch is a bleeder so it lets a little
air pass all the time.

&gt; So, I was wondering why my idle was low at startup, and I probably
&gt; should have checked the regulator way back when..
&gt; 
&gt; I tried blowing through it and it didn't let anything through, even
&gt; though the engine was cold.
&gt; 
&gt; So, I took it off and took it apart and got the little flap moving
&gt; descently.  I'd like to take it apart and regrease it, but it looks 
&gt; like
&gt; it's pressed shut, so there isn't much I can do.
&gt; 
&gt; One thing I'm trying to figure out is if the opening is wide enough. 
&gt;  I
&gt; took two pictures:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; This pic with the smaller opening is how it is when the metallic 
&gt; strip
&gt; is holding the flap open.

&gt; 
&gt; This pic with the bigger opening is me holding it even wider with a
&gt; screwdriver.
&gt; http://www.csulb_dot_edu/~msoultan/open.jpg
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Does it need to open as much as it is in the second pic, or is the 
&gt; first
&gt; opening ok?  Does someone have a cold one that they can compare to?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Mike
