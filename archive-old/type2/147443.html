Subject: Re: [T2] uggh.  cv boots.  again!

&gt; have to wait until the weekend.  The tear is on top, so there's little 

Hehehe.. sorry, just had to laugh at that one.  The cv joint spins so 
it'll eventually be on the bottom ;)

&gt; change something will fly up in through the tear.  The grease is all 
&gt; over the place.  The starter looks real pretty.  So replace them both 
&gt; knowing how new they all were or just the torn one?  Can bad things 
&gt; happen driving it for a week like that?

You know, mine were cracked for a while.  It should be ok for another 
couple weeks as long as they don't get completely drenched or filled 
with tons of dirt.  I know I've run with broken boots for at least 1000 
miles before I was able to change it out.  I would change it as soon as 
possible, though.

George recommended this company:

you might want to give those a try.
