&gt; Hello all,
&gt; I am starting to plan a trip for next summer to do a 2nd honeymoon. We want
&gt; to drive from Charlotte NC to SO Cal, and back. Anyone have ideas for routes
&gt; and things to see on the way??
&gt; Should I go low through the Desert or high through the Plains?

In summer, I'd stay north or at high altitude.  I try do do that, but
sometimes the hot weather follows me.  Who would expect 105F in Buffalo,
Montana?

If you're heading for SoCal, perhaps a Route 66 trip might be fun.  The
highway doesn't exist any more, but it is fun to seek out the remnants.
If you want a more northerly route, US50 is less known, but virtually
intact and provides a &quot;blue highways&quot; trip over most of the route you're
interested in.

Now is the time to hit all those state tourism web sites and order their
brochures.  You can lay out a lot of local events to hit (or avoid) during
your trip.

George
