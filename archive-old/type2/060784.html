Subject: Throwout bearing replacement:need opinion

Hello,

It sounds like the TO bearing is going out on the '72(1700cc pancake.)

Here are the symptoms.

When letting out the clutch a chirping and scratching sound is heard. When
the pedal is fully out and the bus starts moving things are fine. This also
happens when switching form second to third. Have not noticed it during
third to forth but it is probably there. When the bus is in neutral with
clutch pedal in or out everything sounds normal although there is a slight
change in idle rpm.

Also the bus spazzed last night and would not go into first gear! Every time
I tried it just gnashed away. I cut the motor and shifted thru all the gears
and back to first. When I restarted the bus all was fine. I drove another
twenty miles thru city traffic without a reoccurrence of the incident.

I have had no problems with shifting until now.

Here are some questions.
Anybody wanna offer a second opinion on my self-diagnosis?

Should I pull the tranny and just replace the bearing or pull the engine and
do some regular maintenance stuff while I am in there?

Should I pull both as a unit. (this option might involve buying a keg and
inviting list members over to help:)&gt;

Thanks
