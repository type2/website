Subject: Re: [T2] truckers, buses, PLF

Hi All,
            I have driven in AZ for some time now and I can testify to the 
fact a great many drivers here on the freeways drive at 75 + speeds. The area 
around Quartzite is on I-10 in AZ. Many Truckers are also cruising at speeds of 
75 or above. It doesn't help much that the speed limit in most of the state on 
the freeways is 75. So going only 5 mph over the speed limit means cruising 
at 80. Pretty much the norm for most cars here. What I have the biggest problem 
with is drivers not being able to stop or slow down enough when approaching a 
slower vehicle. I usually can go the 75 in my Ghia with no problem and my 2.0 
liter 76 bus can handle it also. I still feel safer at the speed limit but 
going slower should not be a problem and the Trucks need to be able to slow down 
in time when required.  Really lucky no one was killed here. I can make a 
reference to a good lawyer here in Phoenix if the parties wish to contact me 
through P-Mail.
Regards,


David,
