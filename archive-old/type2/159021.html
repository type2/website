Subject: refitting the fan housing end oil seal 

Hi volks,

Here is my problem , it looks like  my leak comes from the oil seal 
behind the cooling fan hub (Hayne call that seal &quot;fan housing end oil 
seal and T. wilson call it crankshaft oil seal). In between this oil 
seal and the cooling fan hub , there is a O ring with No name (bentley 
and others) which look like the culprit guy for my big leak which spraid 
every where trough the fan  . Here are my questions.

1) Whats the name of this O ring ?  Where I can buy it ? do I need it ? 
( this last question seems to be a stupid , but some manual do no 
mention that O ring)
2) I assume that the oil seal and this uname O ring is responsible of 
the oil leak, Type2 archives ( Yes I went there !!! ), mention 2 main 
problems of oil leak blow by the fan , oil cooler seal and deep stick !! 
how often my leak type occurs ?
3) I want to change the O ring and oil seal without removing the engine. 
It looks like I can do so just by removing the fan , than the hub,  than 
replace the seal without removing the cooling fan housing , cover plates 
, exhaust .... Do I miss something ? what is the best way to do it ?
4) Well  I plan to check/test the seal by running the engine for a sort 
period of time without the fan ( with just the cooling fan hub on !!! ), 
can I do that  ? I don't see why not as long as the engine is not 
overheating, but who knows !!!
5) In the even that this crankshaft oil seal (and O ring) is not 
responsible for my leak but the oil cooler seals are, what would be the 
sequence of event to change them.

Sorry for all those questions, I need to get my vanagon camper 83 ready 
for yellow-stone ! :-))))

Thanks for any help.

Chris,vangon 83
