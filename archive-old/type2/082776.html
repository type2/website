Subject: 78 engine yoink

Finally got around to pulling the engine out of my 78
Bus.  Nothing like a layoff to free up time.
The engine turns out to be a VWoCanada rebuild on a 79
block, but with 78 heads, both of which may be
left-side heads (both have the hole for the CHT
sensor)
Is there any way to determine the approximate age of
the rebuild, given the serial number on the yellow
sticker? (78561)  I'd guess the first two digits might
be the model year of application.
Also, what's the preferred method of repairing a
cracked air intake sleeve?
Everything seems to be in decent physical shape- I'll
crack the case tomorrow to inspect and clean the
innards- but the #1 piston was sticking in the
cylinder, thus preventing the crank from rotating more
than 180 degrees... until I loosened that head.
I rebuilt my Beetle's 1500/1600 last summer, and it's
running alright.  The question now is do I try to
rebuild this type-4 myself, perhaps with the addition
of AVP heads, or go ahead and get a complete AVP
engine (which I had sort of budgeted for a while
back). Or do I bring Raby into all this (save a load
on shipping, but I'm not really into more-than-stock
power)
