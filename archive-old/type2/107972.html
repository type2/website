Scott:

I have a nice thick piece of plate glass I use as a flat surface, but I
wouldn't think lapping the cylinders on the glass would be a good idea; it
seems to me that the valve grinding paste would serve to also cut the glass,
destroying the flat surface.

When I lapped my cylinders recently I used a large piece of crocus cloth
taped to the flat surface and lapped the cylinders on that.  The Crocus
cloth is used for very fine metal finishing or precious stone polishing and
seemed to work well here.

&gt; lapping is imperative, it will make a big difference on how well they
seal.
&gt; you need a thick (1/2&quot; or better) piece of glass and some valve grinding
&gt; paste. lap each cylinder in a pool of paste on top on the glass until very
&gt; smooth, this will take maybe 15-30 minutes per.
&gt;
&gt; then place the cylinder into the head with paste applied and lap the two
&gt; together. another 15 minutes or so.
&gt;
&gt; mark the cylinders 1,2,3,4 so you know which is which. clean everything
&gt; really well before assembly.
