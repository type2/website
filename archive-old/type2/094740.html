Subject: Re: [T2] Bizarre Failure

You may be able to find the parts to rebuild the alternator, but you're 
probably better off just installing a new one. Mine just did this recently 
and after talking with a local ACVW parts source I decided that it just 
wasn't worth the trouble to rebuild it. Installed the new alternator and a 
new pulley -- now everything's fine.

If your belt/pulley were installed correctly and this happened, there may be 
another problem with the alternator -- worn shaft, worn woodruff key, etc. 
Chances are that the groove holding the woodruff key (and keeping the pulley 
from sliding into the alternator housing) is probably shot.

I just purchased a brand new Bosch 55 amp alternator for $99. Seen them 
online for about the same money. Good luck and let us know how it goes.
