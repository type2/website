Rory
I feel for you, but where in Southern Virginia are you located.
I'm in lovely Halifax County and have been getting my busses inspected at an
incompetent mechanic in neighboring Mecklenburg who is afraid of my cars and
would rather give it a cursory looking at, rather than fight through the
mess.
I also do all my work on a slab of concrete next to his shop and he figures
as much time as I spend under it, it must be okay.
Never had any trouble with bus inspections, but once with my Ford, tow the
non-running busses home, truck, he didn't pass it because of holes in the
floorboard.
He originally told me if he didn't see the holes, it would pass, for three
years the carpet I put over the holes worked, until that fateful day when he
put his foot through the floor.
Oh well, just some Friday morning thoughts, If you're ever heading through
Halifax on U.S. 58, I'm the log house with loads of busses parked in the
front yard, some actually running and one is being turned into a radar
station by my six-year-old.
Good Luck.

Hey Volks,

   After meeting a listmember over the weekend I decided it was time to
inspect my bus and do what it was meant to due. Drive it. I've let other
projects come first and neglected to renew the yearly hassle. I was not
prepared for what would come of this years must fix to pass list. here is a
short example....

too much body roll needs shocks. he only drove it from the parking lot into
the bay.

turn signal indicator not securely fastened to column.

turn indicator lights not flashing to alert of turn signals on.

no dust boot on master cylinder. shame on me. I should have that.

no defrost motor. 

micro holes under feet in front floor board. exhaust hazard.

Now is it me or is this insane? By the way, here in southern VA you can pump
all the pollution into the air you want. But be safe while you do it. Good
grief that's next.
rant over. thanks I needed that
