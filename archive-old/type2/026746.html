Subject: Recommended Carbs? 
Date: Mon, 2 Jul 2001 08:52:47 -0400 
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I have a 1973 Westy that has a single, two barrel, carb instead of dual
carbs. From what I have heard this is not the stock carb and that the stock
carbs are the dual ones. Is this true for the 73? If it is, why would
someone change the duals to a single carb? What benefits are their in this
change?

I have found a set of the duals with a set of manifolds for my westy. It
seems like changing back to the duals would be better. Can I get some
opinions on changing to duals and what performance changes I can expect to
get.

Thanks,
Corbett
