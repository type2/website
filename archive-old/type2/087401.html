&lt;&lt; If this is what I have, it looks like I'm missing the &quot;gutter rods&quot;- 
anybody 
know of their availability? &gt;&gt;

If your tent is designed to slide into a awning rail, what you need is the 
plastic &quot;keder&quot; piece.

I think I have one of these still in stock.  You slide the keder on to the 
tent and then clip it to your gutter.  $15.95 plus shipping.

If anyone else needs these p-mail and I can order more.
