&gt;my dad, recalling post WWII surplus jeep parts shipped
&gt;in drums of cosmoline, says he thought the trick was a
&gt;kero soak then burn it off
&gt;
&gt;your mileage will surely vary...

	Scrape the majority off the wash/scrub with kero. The fast but not too
safe thing we did in the service was wash the parts down with gas so I
guess any petro based solvent should work. Of course the old gas in the
bathtub path ( as demonstrated by a local 'Biker') will accomplish two
things: 1 Clean the parts and 2 Get you and the local fire crew on the 7PM
news.
