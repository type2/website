If you are sincerely interested in making an appointment to go to the
dismantler to inspect and potentially buy any of these vehicles, please let me know by responding to this email.

In response to several requests for specific vehicle types, as yet, the VAVR automatic notification service does not filter vehicle types, but you should be able to quickly scan the list to determine if what you are looking for is among the list of vehicles. Also, as yet, partial VIN numbers are only available for privacy reasons and the particular model is not available until you express sincere interest in the vehicle. Please contact me if you have any further questions. My contact information is below. Thank you, Chuck B.
