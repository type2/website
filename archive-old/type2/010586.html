You split the case before pulling this hub off the crank?!?  Well, you'll know
not to do that again.

If you had not split the case, or if you want to reassemble it temporarily,
try this:

Place a small piece of flat stock (steel) 1/8&quot; to 1/4&quot; between the hub and the
case under one of the bolt holes in the hub. Make sure this piece of steel
sits across the front main seal bore so you don't drive it into the seal. 

Screw a fan bolt into the hub until it catches the flat stock between the bolt
and the case. Tighten it a little.

Find another piece of flat stock of approximately the same width and do the
same thing on one of the other bolt holes with one of the other bolts.

Tighten both of them down until the hub pops off.  Don't over do it; don't
destroy the case or strip the hub.

You may have to use all three bolt holes, but this method should pull the hub
from the crank.

Thanks to Mac-n-Sons Bug shop in Lexington, Ky. for teaching me this trick.

&gt;     Greetings listees, I disassembled the case before removing my fan pulley

&gt; hub.  I have been unsuccessfully attempting Muir's method of tapping round 
&gt; and round.  With a block of wood as a dampener, I have hit it hard enough 
&gt; with a hammer, to totally gouge and splinter the wood.  I would use a three

&gt; armed harmonic puller, as Tom Wilson directs, but I don't have one.  Does 
&gt; anyone know other methods? Can I use heat?  As always, any help would be 
&gt; appreciated.  Thanks, Pete
