Subject: Re:  Fridge questions...

Hi all.
Ron said...
&gt; Almost all '71s in the U.S. have coolers, but there are a few European
&gt; Westfalias that made it to the U.S. that had an original fridge (I believe
&gt; the fridge brand name is Electrolux). I don't know how well these work or if
&gt; you can still get parts over in Europe for these.  If anyone would like to
&gt; describe their 71 fridge and tell us how well it works I'd be interested and
&gt; I'm sure other 71ers would be curious.

Well Ron is right... I have a 71 with a fridge, it is an Electrolux. 
The van was origanaly purchased in Germany by a teacher at a US base 
over there. She sold it to a guy in CT and I bought it from him.
The fridge did work when I got the van.. but now it doesn't. The 
problem is with the 110/12v convert though (I think).. The fridge is 
just a basic camper style fridge (uses the amonia method). I do 
recall that it took a good amount of time get the fridge to cool 
down. 
I do believe that you can get parts for the fridge (some?) try a 
local appliance repair shop or RV dealer.
I also have the original pamphlet for the fridge and my fiancee 
translated it for me (it is in German) and it mentions the ability to 
have the fridge also connected to gas. I think if you could add the 
gas option the fridge would be great, but if you only can run it on 
110/12v then when your running it on 12v the ole battery is sure 
to drain...
Well there is my bit
