hi volks, i posted last week about a problem with my 76 bus (2.0L FI)
cutting out and i thought i had the problem solved when i replaced my
condenser. well, it ran fine after i replaced the condenser mainly
because i had the points and timing set right-on. a few days later,
while out for a long cruise the bus began a slight miss on a gradual
upgrade. my immediate thought was problems with the expensive fuel
injection stuff that i don't understand. However, before i began
looking for replacement parts i replaced the fuel filter thinking i
may have picked up a bit or water. i poured the contents of the old
filter in a container and it wasn't water i found but lots of rust and
sediment. the bus runs great now.

 i depart for my extended camping adventure thru the southwest on
tuesday. LESSON LEARNED: look for the cheap fix first.

if any of you list members are at the tucson bus show on 27/28 march i
will be driving clyde, a blue and white bus with missouri plates. stop
by and say hi.

if it is worth doing, it's worth doing to excess; celebrate the
grandeur of the universe.'
