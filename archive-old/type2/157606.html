Google on &quot;electric fuel selector valve&quot; and you'll find what you need.  A
shutoff solenoid is just a 3-port fuel valve minus one of its ports!

An alternative is to install an early model reserve valve.  When set
between the normal and reserve positions it shuts off the fuel.

VW did install a fuel shutoff valve in some early Bays.  It went between
the fuel pump and carburator, sensed the fuel pressure produced by a
running engine, and then opened the line from the tank to the pump.  I
think it was a response to the problem of engines being filled with fuel
from leaky carburator float valves.

I've only seen these valves in service manual pictures.  It seems that
any that actually made it into the field were tossed years ago.
