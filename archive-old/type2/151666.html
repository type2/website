Subject: Re: [T2] Leaky Valve Covers

Coming late to the party, but!

For 30 + years I have used the yellow 3m weatherstrip adhesive on the 
valve cover side.  

Make sure that the head to valve surface is absolutely clean and smooth.

My valve covers *never* leak and I usually only change them about once 
every two years.

When I do change them, a sharpened putty knife between the cover and the 
gasket get the seals(and glue) out pretty easily.

Cheers, dave

 Hey,
 
 I just got my new 69 on the road and she runs great!  Worlds better than my 
 71 ever did.  However, I can not seem to get the valve cover from leaking.  
&gt; 
&gt; I have tried the old cork style, and the rubber rubber ones (twice) and they 
&gt; still leaking.  I have threatened to weld them in place (kidding) . Any 
&gt; suggestions?
