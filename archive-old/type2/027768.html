I've read several posts (recent and archived) regarding the problem &quot;engine 
won't turn by hand more than 180 degrees&quot; over the past few months, but 
don't recall seeing any responses.  Did anyone who experienced this problem 
ever find a cause/solution?

Since it's Friday:

Is it just me or do late loaves look better in bright colors?  (Both of mine 
have been dark brown).

Is the Washington State-based driver of a sweet blue early loaf double cab 
that was seen in Atlanta, GA Wednesday night a listmember?  If so, I enjoyed 
gawking at your ride.  What's the official name of that shade of blue?

Grammar Bus says:

&quot;The busses are THERE [a place] in the parking lot with THEIR [belonging to 
them] engines running, but THEY'RE [they are] not warmed up yet.&quot;

Next time:  Any easy way to remember when to use &quot;My bus and me&quot; as opposed 
to &quot;My bus and I.&quot;
