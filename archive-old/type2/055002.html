Bob in Houston sends:

&gt; I know this will open up a can of worms, but...........
&gt; What might the general consensus be for &quot;stuff&quot; to protect dashboard
&gt; vinyl with?
&gt; What ingredients do you look for?
&gt; What is Neats foot's Oil?

I just use Zymol, and for the crudest of reasons: my customer who runs the
mail-order Miata parts house gave me a little bottle of it a couple of years
ago and said, &quot;try this, it's great.&quot; I did, he was right, and it's a good
thing it goes a long way because it's expensive.

Neats foot oil is skin oil from &quot;neat&quot; cattle. I'm not sure just what a neat
cow is--maybe they clean their rooms without being told to? Anyway, that's
what it is.
