Subject: R: [T2] The answers or conjectures re the Electric Beetle
  Engine

&gt;No heat or AC, and no electricity for lights, etc. with-
&gt;out power robbing ancilliaries on the motor. I'm not saying it can't work,
&gt;just that the trade-offs are enormous...

Actually, AC is the easyest thing to achieve, as exhaust air will be
freezing cold... more complicated will be heating from an engine that
doesn't go over 400C...

I heard that the Compressed Air car comes with a 3,3 KW or 5 Kw air
compressor on board... and &quot;refueling&quot; takes a lot of time (4 hours) because
you need to compress air to 300 bar without raising too much the
temperature; otherwise it takes 3 minutes at a gas station equipped.

It runs _at_130 Km/h ('bout 80 Mph) for 300 Km only, but it is cheaper.
