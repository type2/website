&gt; pulling the lifters out of my T4 motor last night to het a good look at them 
&gt; i realized that they are hydraulic. my motor is a '77 2 liter with one 
&gt; rebuild that i know of. The 77 came with solid lifters. the pushrods in my 
&gt; motor are the solid lifter style (with the ends) and the lifters are 
&gt; hydraulic. i suspect that the cam is designed for solid lifters. i have 
&gt; driven about 55 k on this motor with this setup. should i buy new pushrods 
&gt; at this point? or just leave it as is?

if it is working all right I wouldn't touch it.

YMMV
