&lt;&lt;  found a rebuilt box for my '68 bus ($250), but so far have wasted 2
 afternoons with 2 different pullers trying to remove the pitman arm. 
 The nut was not very tight -- came right off.  I had started applying
 Liquid Wrench 2 weeks ago thinking this would help loosen things up, but
 no dice! &gt;&gt;
  I scored a puller at one of the local tool outlets.  Damn thing cost $38!!
Think it's made by K-D tools and has a life time warranty.  I fought with my
steering box for 2 days before buying the tool.  Even tried heat-be careful!
The reservoir line going to the master cylinder is real close to where your
working and it doesn't handle heat well! (lucky I had a spare)  Anyway it took
longer to unwrap the new tool out of it's packaging than it did to take the
pitman arm off!  I can dig up the tool number tomorrow if you need it, but I
gotta split.  I'm off to buy a Thing!!  Ya!!!
   Peace, Love, and this tool has other uses--so it's money well spent,
        Mr. Bubble Head
