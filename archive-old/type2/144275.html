Subject: Loose ends - Re: [T2] Diagnostic Expertise Needed

Just to tie up the loose ends, here - 

1) I'm a little concerned that what is potentially the
coolest-running cylinder (#2) is the one that failed
from an overheating-related issue. As I understand it,
#3 gets the hottest (hence is the site for the FI CHT
sensor) - so why did #2 fail and not #3 or #1?
Serendipity, or shoudl I suspect something more
sinister?

2) I don't have a CHT sensor gauge, but do have a VDO
oil-temp gauge fitted. Now I know these are nowhere
near as good as CHT gauges, but a CHT gauge just isn't
going to happen before we go on vacation, so can
anyone tell me roughly at what oil temperature I
should be worrying/slowing down, to avooid this
happening again? The sensor is currently in the sump
drain plug hole.

3) Shoudl I just bolt the AMC head straight on when it
gets here, or is there anything within reason that I
should do first (lapping the valves??)

thanks
