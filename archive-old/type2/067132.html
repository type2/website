&gt;Free to Good Home, 1959 Double Cargo Door Bus. Have most of the parts
&gt;including the original engine. The bus is in need of restoration but is very
&gt;solid. All glass is in good shape, and body rust is minimal. I hate to part
&gt;with this but I have just purchased a new Impala SS and need my garage. The
&gt;bus is located in Augusta, GA.
