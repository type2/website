Subject: RE: [T2] VW Hippie Bashing

&gt; &gt;-I enjoy passing a plastic minivan with its plastic
&gt; &gt; occupants in my &quot;original&quot; minivan
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Wait, you can pass a minivan with your bus?  :-)

Not only can I not pass a minivan. On the highway Im surprised when I pass
anything.
I even got passed by a house once.
Yes, a house, on 2 huge trailers with 2 small trucks as chase vehicles.
