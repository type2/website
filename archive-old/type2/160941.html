If you were going to switch to an electric fuel pump, looks like the Holly
Red pump fits the bill http://www.holley_dot_com/12-801-1.asp. You could use any
electric fuel pump if you add a pressure regulator  before the carburetor to
reduce the pressure to acceptable levels. I personally would go with option
1, as that danged Murphy likes to stick his nose in everything, and if the
pump is not capable of high pressure it just seems more appropriate than
risking a regulator failure with a high pressure pump.
