Subject: Ignition lock cylinder removal on '78 loaf

I have Alzheimer's - that is what my son is telling me.  Five-six years ago I replaced the mechanical portion of the ignition (not the key cylinder - the part it &quot;mates&quot; to/fits in) on my '78 Loaf and now I can't remember how I did it!?!?!?

I started last Monday evening, removed everything (it was easy because just two weeks ago I replaced the electrical portion - that part that the ignition switch plugs into), steering wheel, etc., hoping I would somehow remember how I got this thing out th
e last time.  It's been four days.  Last evening I searched (for 3.5 hours) the archives, other lists, etc.  Even sent Ken Hooper a message asking what happened to Bob Hoover's Sermons.  Everything I found agrees with Bentley, and that is where I am stuck
:

&quot;To remove the lock cylinder, use pliers to pull the lock cover plate out of the steering lock housing.&quot;  I've tried screwdrivers of varying sizes and strength, there's no way a set of pliers will fit in to remove this (well maybe from the inside...), I e
ven got a brad nail and tried to pry the thing off - nothing but lots of gouges.

Bentley continues: &quot;This will provide access to the hole for lock cylinder removal.&quot;  Uh huh.....

Then the fun begins: &quot;You may find that on 1976 and later vehicles the hole used to release the retaining spring is missing.  A hole must be drilled in the switch housing.&quot;  I did as instructed.  The center of the 1/8 inch hole I drilled is EXACTLY one-ha
lf inch from the lip right where the &quot;valley&quot; is.  There ain't no stinkin' spring anywhere in there - did I mention the hole is now about 3/8&quot; due to &quot;cleaning&quot; it out with a screwdriver for a better view?

Oh yeah, I've tried standing on the steering lock housing, grabbing the top part of the ignition switch with a steroidal pair of channel locks and twisting with all my might.  Unless its reverse threaded it doesn't loosen.  Also have tried turning the key
 to &quot;ON&quot;, pushing the steering wheel lock as far in as it will go and that doesn't do anything either.  I remember this was WAY easy the last time I did it.......

Does anyone have ANY idea how to get this doggone thing out of there?

TIA for ANY ideas (short of C-4)
