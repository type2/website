Of course, the biggest thing to combat rust is to WASH it... It amazes me
how many bus owners let their beloved busses rot in filth... WHY? Rust is
the enemy.. A good wax and wash on a regular basis does a lot of good in
combatting it.

I wash my BUS, at least weekly even in winter.. (actually more so in winter
cause of all the salt, sand and slime)

I don't think this is as important for those of us who live where th eroads
are not salted


Generally, if you maintain your vehicle.. eg. do all the preventive
maintenance stuff at the regular intervals... your bus shouldn't give you
much trouble.

hear hear, unless it is an old POC, in which case it needs major car,e love,
self sacrifice, and will still unashamedly bite your knuckles.
