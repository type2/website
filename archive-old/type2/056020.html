My &quot;76 did the same thing when I bought it ( Single Weber, brake booster
disconnected). First thing I found was that the check valve in the vacuum line
was missing. Got it from West Coast Metric for about 15 bucks. Second, I found
the carb itself was shot, and a new Weber carb made a big improvement. In
fact, now when I step on the brakes, engine RPM's actually increase slighty.
Can anyone explain that?         Jeff
