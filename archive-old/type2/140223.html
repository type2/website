Subject: Re: [T2] 1973 Bus - how to tell which carb is installed?

Hi,

 

The leak is very slow and hard to notice.  If I don't use the van for a
while I need to work it by hand before starting.  During this procedure I
have noticed small drops dripping on the outside of the carb (towards the
engine).

 

I'm not sure if the leak co ntinues once the van is up and running, but I
have the feeling a rebuild could soon be in order.  Other than that the van
seems to work great, good acceleration, ok speeds, etc.  

 

I sohuld really snap a photo to highlight the leak in question.  In the
meantime I ordered the Haynes Weber book and will probably try rebuilding
the current carb as opposed to spending big bucks for a new one.

 

Thanks,

Shawn

 

 

 

&gt; What exactly do you mean by dripping fuel? Do you have gas running down
the outside of the carb and dripping
