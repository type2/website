&gt;which style does that apply to? Is it the same as the fillister, or the

&gt;
&gt;Inquiring minds want to know.

Cheese, let me see. The slotted screws with the heads that look like a
wheel of Edam are the cheese heads. (Won't take that any further.)

Fillister, after Luther, pertaining to the Philistines and more
appropriatly spelled, philipster. It's the round head phillips type with a
maschine thread.
