Subject: How do valves work?

I understand the basic concept of the cam pushing the pushrod which then
pushes the rocker and then pushes the valve, but how does the hydraulic
part work on the hydro valves?  I know that there's the little cylinder
that rides on the cam, but how does it maintain the proper clearances
instead of having to manually adjust the valves with solid lifters?

also, how do modern car valves work?  Are they hydraulic?  Why don't
they need as much adjustment.

Just curious..

Thanks!
Mike
