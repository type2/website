Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Injection Jump

Hi,

Earlier injectors should have a current limiting resistor in series when 
tested with 12 Volts. You won't get pulsing action when you apply a steady 
12 Volts (even with a resistor). The pulsing action is a result of the ECU 
injector pulses that vary in rate with RPM.

&gt;From Kevzag7_at_aol_dot_com
&gt;I jumped each of my fuel injectors directly from the battery to see if they
&gt;had a nice atomizing spray, and if they worked at all.  I got a continuous
&gt;atomizing spray, and I was wondering if it should be an alternating spray 
&gt;(on -
&gt;off - on - off) rather than a continuous spray.
