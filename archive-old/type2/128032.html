Subject: Germany vs Brazil Master Cylinder

In looking at a new master cylinder for Possum I see two choices on Bus Depot. $120 for a German one or $30 for a Brazilian one. Is the Brazilian one really that cheap (lower quality) or is the German one simply that good plus its OEM? Doesn't seem to be a whole lot of stuff that could be different other than the quality of rubber in the seals right? Anyone have anything bad to say about Brazilian Bus Depot Mater Cylinders? Thanks
