Subject: Re: [T2] '78 Westy firewall removal?

Is there a way to test the fuel sender when it is out? I have mine out now 
and would like to check it before I reinstall it.

&gt; &gt; Your sender is probably dying.  Heck, fix that while you've got the
&gt; &gt; firewall off.


&gt;Doh, too late for that!  It's already back in place.  Not a big deal,
&gt;though.  I'll just go by mileage or keep it more than half full.  ;)
