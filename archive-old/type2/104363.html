Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Wanted in BC

Thanks for the tip. I think Karl got his Vans mixed up. I am in Vancouver,
British Columbia, Canada. This one is in Vancouver, Washington, USA (A few
hundred miles away.) I can tell you from personal experience that importing
a used vehicle is not nearly as much fun as it sounds, and am trying to find
one north or the border.
Cheers,
Mathew

&gt; Here is a decent looking 78 Champagne Edition.
