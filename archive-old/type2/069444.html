Subject: Steering Column on '66

Hi!

I'd like to repaint the steering column on my '66 bus, and the bracket that
secures the column against the dash.  I've got the steering wheel apart, 
but I can't actually get the steering wheel off.  I certainly don't have the 
VW tools that they list in the Bently.

Any Ideas?

...Markus
