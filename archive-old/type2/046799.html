Subject: Re: [T2] Valves Job

&gt;valves, you will just have an unusual arrangement which can be tuned just as
&gt;effectively,
&gt;but it will be misleading to you and others the next time the valves need
to be
&gt;adjusted.
&gt;the ultimate solution to this is removing and reinstalling the distributor
drive
&gt;gear properly so that the pulley notch, distributor notch, rotor direction
and
&gt;confirmation of
&gt;valve movement with the naked eye are all in alignment.

I'm going to mention for the record that although everthing Chris has said
is 100% true and quite sensible, there are times and means when you have
to install a dizzy in this manner.  Prime example occurs when a bug or 050
dizzy finds its way into a FI T4.  The vacuum cans on the bug or something
I don't recall on the 050 will end up requiring a differenct arrangement to
physically fit and avoid the FI parts, tin, etc.  So as long as like Chris
says
you simply assure you are at TDC for the correct cylinder, it doesn't matter
where that rotor points on the housing of the dizzy as long as you time it
and put the wires in the correct places to make it work.  Watch the valves
and the mark on the pulley/fan volks.  If you got stock parts though, there
is no reason not to shift the drive gear to where Bentley or whoever implies
it should be so your dizzy lines up like daddy VW intended.  (Well a
possible reason is always the chance a shim will drop down in the
crankcase, but you got to decide how much it bugs you and how
daring you are.)
