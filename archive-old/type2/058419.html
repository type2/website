Subject: Jetting

Yo,

Several messages recently have raised the concern in my mind that folks are
not jetting their VW's to reflect changes made to the engines.  Allow me to
recommend some guidelines.  My experience is limited to the upright and
type 3 engines, but I've no doubt the same principles apply to the type 4
pancake.

Stone Cold Dead Stock, this means stock engine size, air cleaners, exhaust,
compression, distributor, fuel, etc.  
	Hey, use the stock jet size, which is 125 for the 34 PICT-3.  If it still
seems hot, go to 127.5.

ANY SINGLE THING other than stock, Berg Semi-Hemi heads, 009 distributor,
extractor exhaust, etc.
	127.5-130 mains minimum

ANY TWO OR MORE THINGS other than stock, 
	135 mains

SUPER STOCK, Berg Semi-Hemi heads, 6.9:1 CR, dual carbs, paper or screen
air cleaners, 009 distributor, Pertronix or other CDI ignition, single or
dual extractor exhaust, ratio rockers.
	140 mains minimum, I have these in my engine and, even without the ratio
rockers, it's still not quite enough.  I'm trying 142's and 147's soon
(can't find 145's), I'll let you know.  Also refer to the Hot-VW's article
on the SCAT stock engine with dished pistons (lower CR) that recommends the
same thing.  They stopped at 140 but I think 145 is supported when the
timing is advanced to take advantage of the lower CR.  Hot-VW's didn't do
that, or didn't talk about it.

LARGER ENGINES 1641-1776, Depending on the fuel delivery system and other
components, but even with stock carbs and exhaust, please start at.......
	150 mains and work up from there, if it's a super set-up with dual carbs
and extractor, it will easily support 160, 165 or even 170 mains.

BIG ENGINES 1776-1980, I think you're getting the picture here, MORE FUEL,
start at 160 mains, 170 if it's a super set-up.

Taller Soapbox here:
I burnt up a 1776 engine on 130 mains and a round silver &quot;pressure
regulator&quot;(read restricted) set at 2.5 PSI.  I believe they were both
responsible for the extreme exhaust temperature and resulting melted heat
exchangers, burnt valves, cracked heads and scorched cylinders.  I once
returned a pair of Kadrons because they &quot;wouldn't make power&quot; on a large
engine.  They were simply not jetted high enough.  I've read everything
Berg ever published and I believe when he says he can lean out the mix on a
lowered CR engine it's because his initial jetting was way higher than us
backyard types ever imagined.  When I tried the 130 mains (perfect right
out of the box, guy on the phone said so) in the Weber dual 34 ICT's on my
super stock 6.9:1 CR engine, it had nasty intake backfiring, the classic
lean condition symptom.  No amount of idle jet changes would help, only
until I went to the 140's did it settle down.  When I tried the stock carb
on this engine it ran hot and was horribly lean.  I couldn't seem to find
larger Solex jets.  The Dellorto manual says a &quot;race ready&quot; 1600cc engine
is jetted 160 or higher, and that jetting is mostly related to venturi
size.  When I hear about 1641's with 110 or 120 mains that positively
scream, I cring and imagine the exhaust valves red hot on their seats, and
then the inevitable failure at 9435 miles.  

I have an 02 sensor at the merge point of the exhaust and I'm finding that
the mixture changes even with the level of fuel in the tank.  When it's
full, the mix is richer than when it's near empty.  I also think the
outside temperature causes changes, when it's summer and hot it's leaner
than when it's cooler.  The first ten minutes of driving are richer than
later on, and I have the thermostat and flaps in operation.  It seems
ridiculous but if I really were serious I would change both the jets
(richer) and spark plugs (colder) before heading out for the mountains from
the city.  Folks seem to think their fuel mileage will get better with
leaner jets, I beg to differ, you weaken the engine when you do this and it
loses it's efficiency, not being able to make the amount of power it could
were it supplied with sufficient fuel.  I believe there is also a small
amount of evaporative cooling effect that helps keep engine temps down.  Be
very careful when relying on the spark plug color, unless it was taken out
hot off the highway, you not likely to get an accurate color.  I don't
believe that the level of pollution out of a lean engine is less than that
of a properly jetted engine.

The VW loves fuel and must have it to run cool and strong.  Bergs jetting
was a proprietary secret, and I think it's because he ran on the rich side
of everything, though I don't believe even they are sending out carb kits
rich enough for what people are putting together.  Closely check your fuel
lines, pump, and filter for weakiness and restrictions.  If you've made ANY
changes to your engine, check those jets, bump them up.  

But, of course, don't believe anybody, think for yourself.

Sincerely,
