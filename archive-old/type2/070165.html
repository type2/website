Subject: RE: HEAT CAUSE

&gt;vituperation, but I'll STILL vote for combustion as the leading source of
&gt;engine heat.  And I still think that all the unscorched air compressors
&gt;in the world (many of them making air pressures my engine can't match)
&gt;are a pretty clear counterexample.

The compression assertion was interesting, so I'm not taking sides anymore.
I used to be a combustion man. ;) But I'm not convinced that an air
compressor is a counter-example. On a compressor, the valve is *open* on
the compression side of the stroke, not closed. Equivalent to an exhaust
cycle.

So when you calculate compression ratio on a compressor, you'd do it with
the displacement of the cylinder on the left side of the colon and volume
of the entire air capacity--cylinder + tank + hose--on the right.

Therefore whether or not compressors generate pressures that engines can't
match, they really don't do very much compression in the heat-generating
sense. Any particular stroke compresses the total air volume very little.
Where an engine does 7:1 or more on every cycle.

Am I missing something?

Doesn't anybody have an authoritative text so we cn put this thing to bed?
