35mpg seems hard to believe. i want one though :) a bus that can do that!
man that would be great! my 74 bus gets around say maybe 16 in the city (90%
is city driving) and maybe 19 on the highway. i drive about 8 miles total a
day if i only commute to work and back. not a heck of alot of driving. the
bus runs great though if i ever go on long trips so i am thankful for that.
before i put in my '71 westy camper interior i got around 18mpg in the city
and around 22 in the highway. so i guess that sounds about right for my year
w/ dual carbs (arrrrgghhh!!!)

does fuel injection help out on the mileage?
