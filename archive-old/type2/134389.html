Subject: Help finding a short!

I had a similar issue with my 70 bus, on the way home from Oregon and back 
home in Ontario. I looked everywhere, I couldn't see anything wrong with the 
wiring. Then, I found it...
Disconnect your battery.
Unthread the switches from the switch bodies.
Remove the bezels from the three dash switches(lights, wipers, emergencies) 
by unthreading them with needle nose pliers.
Drop the switches down below the dash.
Note that they are choked with dust bunnies between all of the terminals? I 
blew fuse after fuse, it drove me nuts.
Use air or a toothbrush to clean it up really good. If you need to, remove 
the wires to give it a good cleaning(after making a diagram of the colour 
codes to what terminals.)
After you're done with that, take some black electrical tape and go around 
the outside of the wire group on each switch with a loop, which will help 
eliminate them shorting to the dash and other wires.

I did this and haven't had an electrical gremlin since, unless not starting 
when it's hot sometimes counts...

&lt;Now I have these issues:

- turn signals make brake indicator on dash come on, but only if
headlights are on

- turn signals eventually quit working, replacing relay does nothing

- brake lights no longer work

- if you turn on the emergency flashers, the radio dies an&gt;
