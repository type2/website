Subject: On removing clothes closet from Westfalia, what the trick?

I asked for some help on Saturday, which may have not been the best day for 
such a request.
I've got a '75 with the clothes closet mounted over the spare tire well, and 
I'd like to remove it temporarily for better (wider) access thru the rear 
door. I tried removing all the brackets and screws that I could find but it 
still seems to be retained to the van body somehow, specifically at the top 
of the cabinet. I'd appreciate hearing from anyone who has taken out such a 
cabinet as to what is the means of releasing this hidden connection. I've 
unsrewed the two brackets on the bottom of the long side, and the one 
interior at the lower front side, and the screw on the curved interior 
panel, but still can't slide the cabinet toward the midline of the van for 
removal. Is it possible that the fit is so tight that you have to force it?
Thanks for taking the time to respond, anyone who has done this task.
Roland
'75 Westy
