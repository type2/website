&gt; &gt;okay, so VW had a tool so you could replace ball joints without using
&gt; &gt;a press. does anybody have a part# for it. I can't find one in the Hazet

&gt; I have no idea if this will work on a Bus but I was surfing and noticed it.

John, list:
There's one of these on a shelf at the Ford/ VW dealer I've been working at
recently. I thought it looked pretty nice, but thought it was a Ford tool.
I'll take a type 2 ball joint along next time I go over there and see if it has
the right size cups and drivers and report back. This would easily save many
people $100 worth of work.
