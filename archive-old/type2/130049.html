&gt;Early buses (up to and including the '71) had a removable &quot;apron&quot; so you

Ok.

&gt;You said you removed the engine without jacking up the bus......if you have
&gt;a late bay and removed the engine without a lot of jacking up and down and
&gt;all around to get it off the spline you are a magician. If you have an early
&gt;bay (with the apron) than I can't think of any reason to jack up the engine
&gt;or bus as long as the spline lines up.

We jacked it up to remove the engine.  We had a tough time getting the 
engine/trans separated, which I believe was due to the fact the bus was at 
an angle, and we were not pulling the engine directly back from the 
transmission on the same plane.  That's what got me thinking it would be 
better (easier) to have the bus sitting on its wheels.


&gt;Yes I cleaned that oil up.

That looks like my garage floor after I knocked the engine off of the 
dolly.  Next time I'm going to drain the oil from the engine before I 
remove it.  Oh well, it's been relatively smooth for my first engine 
pull.  I just have to figure out how this last piece of engine tin goes on 
before I can put it all back together :-)

Thanks for all the replies.
