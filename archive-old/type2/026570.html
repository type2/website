&gt;My original equipment, low mileage (only 172k miles)
&gt;transmission has recently began shifting into 1st and
&gt;3rd with what I would describe as a squishy feeling.
&gt;Shifting into 2nd, 4th and reverse still has a
&gt;positive feeling, a definite click. This has only
&gt;started in the last month. Is this an internal

Take a look at your rear shift coupling.  It is a squarish metal frame with
2 rubber inserts on the sides - about 1.5&quot; square.  It attaches to the
transmission shift shaft via a set screw that should have a piece of safety
wire through it and on the other end, there is a long (2&quot;?) set screw that
runs through the 2 rubber pieces and sandwiches the shifter shaft between
them.  The rubber pieces wear out (and fall out).  These things are cheap
and fairly eash to replace.  Worth looking at anyway.
