Subject: Which clutch &amp; TO to use??

I have a 67 bus that has the original 67 transmission
in it.  The replacement engine I have to put into this
bus is an AE code case 1600 DP (all the info I've
found tells me this is a 71 engine)
I know that after 70, the clutch pressure plate and TO
bearing changed, right?? So to mate up a 67 tranny to
a 71 engine, which clutch &amp; TO bearing should I use,
for a 67 or for a 71?? 
My instinct tells me that i should use the later
clutch to match up with the later engine, But I want
to be sure.
