&gt; Anyone with an automatic bus had to worry about this in hilly areas?

the exit from my alley and garage is a fairly stiff grade to a main road,
so I always have to stop as it is a blind exit.  YES an automatic will
roll backwards and it can stall, AMHIK

  I have the advantage of hand controls and can apply both the gas and
brake at the same time from the single control so it makes it a lot
easier.
