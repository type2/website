&gt;Hi! Welcome to the list, you'll find some of the best info around, great
for
&gt;getting you out of a spot. You should be careful though of info regarding
&gt;engines etc, as the list is more for the 1700-2000cc &quot;pancake&quot; lumps. As to
&gt;reading, a Haynes manual will help put pic's to the posts you are sent (I
&gt;keep mine next to the computer). You should also get &quot;How to keep your VW
&gt;alive&quot; good fun to read &amp; give REAL idiot guides to many complicated
&gt;operations As you can see we to are based in London, Ealing to be exact,
&gt;where are you? If you need a good &amp; reasonable garage, then I can recommend
&gt;1, or a couple of good but pricey ones.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway it's nice to hear from more local lister's, If you need any info
etc.
&gt;mail me.
&gt;
&gt;Bye.
