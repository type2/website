Subject: AVP problems

I recently received a botched packing list, incorrect delivery time and
cylinder head that was shy about a quarter inch of thread on an exhaust stud
from AVP. I notified AVP and let the rest fall into place. Unfortunately,
the stud was not removable by any means I had and I took it to a machine
shop. I let AVP know what happened and requested a refund of the shop bill.
I sent the old head and a SASE to AVP for core and shop fees. I got a check
in the mail that, more than satisfied the machine shop bill. Pleased! Still
waiting for the core.

I had no problems contacting AVP, around lunchtime PST with my concerns.

Currently, I'm trying to locate and fix the Oil/fuel leakage that is coming
from , as best I can determine from the cylinder sleeve to head mating
surface on 1 &amp; 2 side. I'm glad the List is around, otherwise I'd be driving
my van around right now, less $1200.00 that the estimated repair bill for a
head replacement.
