Subject: speedo problem

----------------
My speedo is acting weird. When I am holding a rather
constant cruising
speed, my speedo is jumping around (about 3 mph of
movement, bouncing back and forth). 
---------------------------

Check the cable at the hub. it has a &quot;square&quot; end that
should be seated firmly into the hole in the hub. If
the
circlip has fallen off it is probably pulled out some
and is dancing around in the hole. Hopefully you catch
it before it is too rounded off to be useable. Or the
metal
dust cap on the driver's side hub is not seated so
that
when it goes round it wobbles like a hub cap not on
all the way.. that also could cause erratic response
in the
speedo.

Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me;
Other times I can barely see.
Lately it occurres to me What a long, strange trip it's been.
