Hi all,
It it with great sadness that I must sell BUZZO, My family bus.  It is a 
very, very solid 1979 bus with a rebuilt 2L with around 30K  rest of bus has 
123K.  This bus represents the best of the last 4 busses I have owned.  It 
was a sunroof bus but the PO had removed the sunroof and installed the poptop 
and cot from a 73 Westy.  
It has Vanagon front seats, front mounted spare, Denon Stereo, Carpeted 
removable floor panel, and a full Westy interior (all cabinets, curtains 
[orange with rods]  bed, sink, fridge, swivel bottom for passenger seat, 
screens outlet etc.) from a 77 westy included but not installed.  The only 
thing (I dont have for it are the crank out side windows. )  This bus is 
currently registered, NYS inspected and a daily driver. I also have a 
generally complete but unsafely rotted 78 parts bus which will be available 
to the buyer of the 79 before it is parted out and junked.  This Bus is well 
worth it I just bought an 87 vanagon, or I'd be keeping it.  Located 20mi 
north of NYC E-mail for more details.
