Are you sure you don't also have a condenser on the body of the distributor?

Usually when a condenser is mounted to the positive terminal of the coil, it
is there for radio static supression.




&gt; This talk about the condenser change-out problems and another listee's
&gt; request for wiring help on the low voltage side of the ignition system led
&gt; me to check out the wiring on my 1.8L '75's coil. Low and behold I
&gt; discovered that the condenser (which is mounted conveniently on the coil
&gt; instead of the distributor) was for all these years attached to the wrong
&gt; pole of the coil!(#15 instead of #1). So maybe now I'll get a better spark
&gt; and longer-lasting points in the future. But imagine all the sparks that
&gt; have gone by with an inadequate dampening of the arcing from those
&gt; points...I sure would like to know who goofed when they replaced the
&gt; condenser. At least with the condenser mounted on the distributor you
can't
&gt; make that mistake!
