I will never trade a VW for a Motor home. I do not want something that sits
for 8 months of the year rotting away(wood construction), just to be driven
on a few camping trips and get 8MPG the whole way. I have room to store one
out in the weather, but this destroys them. I can store my VW in my shop
nice and cozy. If the VW sits, at least it is dry and safe, it won't rot
away.  I can go a lot farther on 18 MPG than I can on 8 MPG with my budget.
If I get a travel trailer, I will have to buy a bigger truck than I
currently have to tow it and haul all the kids. For my situation, a Vanagon
Westy, or maybe a 76-79 Bay Westy is going to be my best bet. I may try to
tow a loaner pop-up tent trailer and see how the bus does. I am just afraid
that the trans give up on me.

With a proper hitch your camper can tow a lightweight tent trailer without
difficulty.  That might be an alternative to swapping the Westfalia for a
Winnebago :-)

&gt;&gt;  But at the moment my wife wants me to tow a pop-up railer behind the bus
so we will have the room.  I told her no-way, it will kill the poor Bus.  &lt;&lt;
