Subject: Parts needed

Help, I'm in need of some more parts for my 1978 Westy before I can put it
on the road.  I'm looking for some nice Hella Taillight assemblies as well
as the Hella side marker assemblies (front and rear).  I ordered some
aftermarket parts, but they didn't fit right and the quality was not up to
my expectations so I sent them back- since I finally got the bus painted,
I'm trying to get it looking really nice :).  I also need some wiper arms
and the front emblem and possibly some heater boxes.  Any help locating
these parts would be greatly appreciated- just e-mail me.
Thanks in advance.
Robert
