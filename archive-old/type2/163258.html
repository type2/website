Subject: Re: [T2] Sound deadening...

&gt; I have seen this before, it was not treated in any way that I would be 
&gt; doing it or that any expert would suggest, it was filled with things that would 
&gt; hold water, not dynamat and bubblewrap, I think that this example has nothing 
&gt; to do with sound deadening and everything to do with not having any common 
&gt; sense.
&gt; 
   Apologies to anyone I might have seemed to disparage...
The &quot;Common Sense&quot; was the point I was trying to make...
