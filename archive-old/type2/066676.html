Subject: VWoA ad campaigns

I personally find the Speed Racer commercials amusing, but whatever 
happened to the two really good slogans they had going?  Drivers wanted 
and The most loved cars in the world are SO much better.  I think I saw 
one most loved cars commercial and I watch TV enough to see way more 
than that in a reasonable amount of time.  I think VW campaigning should 
hire whoever does the Saturn commercials- they sure do get a good aura 
going with their small company who loves their work and everyone loves 
their cars thing, don't they?
