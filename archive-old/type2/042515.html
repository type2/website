&gt; Well, the rest of today I'll work on the interior panels. Mine are in
&gt; decent shape.  I was going to put some Thompsons on the backsides and
&gt; clear urathane semigloss on the front.

Don't do that. You want the same material (semigloss polyurethane varnish in
this case) on both sides of the panel--if you don't you'll run into
moisture-absorption problems and possible cracks, warps, etc.

If you do go with semigloss, use gloss poly for all but the last coat. Rub
it down good with steel wool between coats. (Rubbing it down may dull it
enough that you don't use the semigloss on the last coat.) To get poly
semigloss they put a &quot;flattening agent&quot; in it--it's usually something like
fine silica--to cut the gloss. You build several coats of that and you'll
obscure the grain pattern.
