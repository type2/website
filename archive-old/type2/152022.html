&gt; I am not talking about pouring the grease into
&gt; the ground, I am talking about not jacking any
&gt; vehicle up into the sky but rather working on
&gt; it standing up underneath it.  Perhaps the
&gt; terminology is wrong (&quot;grease pit&quot;) but that's
&gt; what I knew to call it when I was younger and
&gt; Walt Land worked on my dad's Crosley, etc.
&gt; No &quot;grease monkey&quot; in small town Georgia had a
&gt; lift but they all worked in a &quot;pit.&quot;

ohhhhhhh! a &quot;shop pit&quot;  would love to have one,

Bob
