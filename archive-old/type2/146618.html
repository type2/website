&gt;Just want to share this info with those Volks who are in California and

&gt;I'd like to praise Tassi inc (www.tassiinc_dot_com) which is a specialist 
&gt;for Volkswagen.
&gt;Not only he is a great mechanic but more interesting for us, he has A 
&gt;LOTS OF used parts. !!

I've heard good things about them also. At first I only thought they did watercooled VWs but they seem to do it all.
