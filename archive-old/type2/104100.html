  My name's Aaron. I got your name off the AIRS Bus Rescue site. I'm in sort
of a jam and I'm  hoping you can shed some light on my situation. I have a
'77 VW Transporter parked up in Flagstaff ( I threw a connecting rod). I
just found a 2.0L engine here in Phoenix. So I'm trying any way I can to get
my bus towed here, either on a flatbed or towdolly. I was hopin' you might
know who has a tow dolly, either here or in Flag. I have money to pay
someone for their time, and whatever else they might need. Thanks for your
time my friend. Peace &amp; Togetherness,      Aaron
