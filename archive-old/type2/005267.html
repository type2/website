Subject: Transmission fluid instead of Oil?

Renoir here.

Hey it is Friday.
A mechanic friend says he uses straight transmission fluid instead of oil in
his engine
and claims it runs smoother and does not overheat.

I have used a little transmission fluid as an engine cleaner before changing
oil, but never as an oil replacement.

Any thoughts? Has anyone tried this before?
