Subject: Oil drain plug

There are less drastic measures than partially
disabling the engine.  Just the added stress on the
engine combined with unburned fuels in the exhaust can
accelerate or cause other problems down the line.  

I keep, kept rather, two extra lug bolts from my '69
bus because the threads often fit the drain plug hole.

Shortly after we acquired them, both my '79 Westy and
my friend's '89 Vanagon lost our drain plugs and oil
because of stripped threads inherited from our
respective PO's - the latter while returning from
Joshua Tree last month.  

In both cases the old lug bolts held well enough to
get back home and then some.  I drove around town for
a couple weeks before I replaced my plug.  Leaked a
couple drips a day.  Not bad for an emergency fix.
