Michael/All,

Hmmmmm. Are the LEDs brighter than the original? Are
they a drop-in item? If so (to both) where does one
find them??? Radio Schmuck?

I don't really want to go through it again, but if I
found something that would light up my guages so that
I could actually *see* them, I might be interested.

&gt; out...
