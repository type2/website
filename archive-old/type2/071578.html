I'm also graduating high school this year, I have a 73 bus.  This bus is my 
second one. My parents did convince me to get rid of the first one, but then 
I turned around and bought the second one.  I always tell people that no 
matter what, I will always have my bus, even when I'm a little old lady.  I 
have a sticker in my window that says, &quot;I'd rather push my Volkswagen than 
drive any other car&quot;  I don't think you should get rid of it, but if you 
decide to, I can take it off your hands, and then I'll drive past your house 
everyday and wave, and you'll be so sad that you got rid of it..
