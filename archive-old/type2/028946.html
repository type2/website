Hello folks,

We are currently working on a section of our website for type2 list
subscribers. This section will allow subscribers to have access to there own
personal web pages with photo hosting, maintenance scheduling, current
project pages with parts illustrations and parts wish lists plus more. This
will also have a type2 list current specials page. This will be a section of
currently discounted parts for type2 lists subscribers only.

Our mission statement. In Beautiful Boulder Colorado, type 2's grow on
trees. There are great resources for parts and service. We don't try to
compete with local business, rather we're here for the folks around the
country or internationally that don't have these great resources in their
back yard. We try to discount our used parts based off of the current price
for the same product new. We are here to help keep these buses on the road.
We would like to start helping folks with there restoration project as well.
So along with used, and reconditioned products, we are starting to add new
restoration items to our catalog. We rely on West Coast Metrics for these
parts. As volume on these items increases we will be able to compete with
other established new product distributors. Remember we only sell 1968-1979
bus parts. This allows us to become the experts, the place to find your
parts, in essence storing your virtual parts bus is our business. We drive
bay window buses and love to work on them. Help us keep our and your dream
rolling, turn to www.BUStedVW_dot_com for your next bus parts purchase.

If anyone has any questions, comments, or concerns please feel free to
contact me. Several type list subscribers have purchased from us, so feel
free to inquire about our products from the list. All used parts are cleaned
and inspected before shipping. We guarantee all of our parts for 30 days.

Was wondering if BUStedVW_dot_com is willing to haggle a little on prices or do
they give type2 list members a discount of any kind.

Thank You,
