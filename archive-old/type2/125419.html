Subject: Re: [T2] West Coast Core

Ebay feedback is a really lame indicator of the seller's &quot;honor&quot; or quality.
Buyers are very hesitant to submit - feedback because of retaliatory -
feedback. I know of another Ebay seller that is a complete scumbag and has
perfect feedback as a power seller. Caveat Emptor.

I know a lot about West Coast Core, and choose to say nothing if I have
nothing good to say. ;-)
