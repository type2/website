Subject: Re: [T2] Painting wheels with POR

Wow Dave--

I have an awfully hard time believing that the finish on any wheel would
start flowing--
That's really crazy--

Think about all the litigation that would be going on if this was a
fact,
There would be wheels flying off all kinds of vehicles--the roads would
be lined with them--

I ain't buying that one--
And I do agree with you--them wheels never get that hot---

Maybe if you had a stuck caliper riding on the rotor all day--maybe it
would make the wheel awfully hot--but not enough to make any powder
coating run---

Have you ever seen any paint on any wheel blister from brake heat?

I sure haven't--and powder coating is tougher than paint--

More key board thinking from Jamie (?)--:&gt;)_

See Ya--

TK

Terry,
Whooo! Jamie Rivers(I think) and I had this conversation about a year
ago and his experience was close to personal. He blamed it on the fact
that the drum/rotor got very hot and caused the powder coat to flow
again.
I listened and paid attention and when I recently did some wheels in
powder coat, it didn't bother me at all...because! I have had to reheat
some already powder coated stuff and realized two things....it really
doesn't &quot;flow&quot; again except at about 400 degrees plus(and not even
really then). The second part was that I have a infrared thermometer now
and have checked my drums/ brakes after several hi speed stops...
The *rims*/lug nut parts never got anywhere close to that temperature...
So, I torqued mine down good and drove off into the sunset....
Cheers, dave
