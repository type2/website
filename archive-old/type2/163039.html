Subject: Re: Idle crankcase fumes

I noticed the oil I uses smokes even when the engine is off.

Oil is at 200F, Castroil 20W50 and after the engine is shut off, fumes
come out of the breather. Enough fumes to make the nose of the air
cleaner smoke when all is connected. Looks like cigar smoke.

Would fuel in the oil make the oil smoke ?

I now switched to WT30 and will keep the list posted. There was metal
dust in the oil but no abnormal smell. It seemed OK.

(I had asked this :)
 At idle crankcase fumes come out under the engine through the lower
 portion of the oil filler vent tube. It makes tailgaters believe that
 old VW stink or the engine is blowing but i am quite convinced it is
 not. It comes out in pulses. Not very big smoke. At night when a car
 is stopped behind with the lights on it gets easier to see.

 More info
 - the engine does not burn oil at freeway speeds
 - At about 1500rpm and above the smoking under the engine stops. That
 means all the fumes are swallowed via the normal breather path : oil
 filler tube-&gt; breather hose -&gt; port inside air cleaner.
 - If I put my hand on the intake of the stock oil bath air cleaner at
 idle, enough vacuum is created in the oil breather port of the air
 cleaner for it to suck all the fumes via the breather. No more fumes
 come under
 - I tried both connectors for the breather on the oil cooler. With
 each port smokes comes out under the engine at idle
 - compression is in the 135s all around. 1600cc with 7.55CR. 800 miles
 on my baby
 - valve covers are new, valve covers surfaces on heads are flat and tight
 - valves are at 0.06
 - heads were not loose (I found only one of the 8 nuts accessible
 without pulling the engine loose). No change after torquing that one
 nut. No change after replacing the new valve cover gaskets with newer
 ones.
 - castor oil 20w50. I am planning to switch to 30w because engine is
 new and oil pressure is (really) high enough.
 - this seems to have started after I decided to race with a semi. I
 did about 3 minutes at 70mph. (and won the semi :)
 - oil bath air cleaner has new oil in. Level before flush was normal
 - Fumes happen with any oil temp. From 70F to 200F

 Found nothing in the archives relevant to this.

 thanks
 - Arnaud
