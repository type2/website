I think West Coast Metric sells the Deutchland badges, but they may be
oval. I bet you can find the German eagle badges at any big auto parts
store between the blacklight ground effects stuff and the &quot;Heartbeat of
America&quot; window tinting. :0 Good luck,

I forgot to mention something the oter day.

A couple of busses at the show had very cool germany badges on 
their bumpers.  It was chrome with gear-like edges, a yellow and 
black center overlaid with the german eagle thing.  Does anyone know 
who makes these or if they are even available.

Also, I saw some very cool oval country plates that had the year of 
the vehicle on them like this:

   |-\
19 |  | 57  (That's a large D in the middle)
   |_/
   
They attach to the bumper stays on a little stand.  Does anyone have a 
source on these? I found that they had a high &quot;coolness&quot; factor!

Signed,

Mikey... in search of cool items.
