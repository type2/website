Subject: Re: [T2] dashboard repair...

&gt;                        Whilst looking through the Eastwood Restoration 
&gt; products how-to section
&gt; on refinishing (Mercedes-Benz...) alloy wheels, I browsed through the on-line 
&gt; catalog a
&gt; bit and noticed an extensive line of plastic welding/repair products. Seems I 
&gt; recall a list
&gt; member looking for a method/source for repairing cracks in their dash board. 

I wonder why there havent been any reproduction dash caps for busses. Ive
seen them for beetles, supers and ghias as well I think. Bummer.
