Subject: Re: [T2] Endplay? Crankshaft moving

Yes I am sorry about this I did get the understanding of the free play with 
the flywheel/flexplate off. I also have my endplay set to .0045&quot; this was as 
close as I could get with the shims I had. My email was screwed up at this 
time and a lot of emails are coming in as much as 3 weeks late. Sorry for 
the semi-repetative posting half went through the others did not until now.

Thanks,

Michael Knight


&gt;From: &quot;Dave C. Bolen&quot; You got a fair response on this before...go search 
&gt;thu the archives, but
&gt;just for the record, here is my first reply on this.

&gt;This is one of the *more* important things to know how to do...*Where*  is
&gt;your manual!!

&gt;Yes, there will be a *lot* of play without the flywhell/flexplate/shims
&gt;installed.  The proper way to do this is to *read the manual* and
&gt;understand that you measure the first time with 2 shims on and then find
&gt;the correct thickness of shim to make the endplay come out where it is
&gt;supposed to(factory specs).
