&gt;Most of the cars on the road match the bumper height of the bus relatively
&gt;well, particularly if overriders are installed.  The bumper is designed
&gt;with a little &quot;give&quot; to it (that's why the mounting holes are slotted, to
&gt;allow the bumper to slide).  If you get hit on the bumper at low speeds
&gt;you are unlikely to sustain damage.

&gt;OTOH, the tire mounted above the bumper will transfer any impact loads
&gt;directly to the front sheet metal of your bus.  There is no &quot;give&quot; to
&gt;that, it just dents.

George illustrated my point exactly.

I do have a spare tire mount on the front of my bus and I perfer to carry a second spare on trips but for around towning I let the bumper do the bumping.
