Subject: Re: [T2] Too many questions?

We're a talkative bunch... If it's too much, look around, there are other lists that are not so active but none will be the resource that this one is. I've archived the past 30,000 messages so I can search for questions/answers offline b/c by modem I'm slow. 

I suggest you make an e-mail program &quot;rule&quot; or &quot;filter&quot; and don't read the list, just search for your answers in that archive. Shoot, I've gotten 600+ messages since Thursday. I've read about 20. 

My e-mail sorts out mail coming directly to me and puts list mail in their own groups for later reading. I actually read about 3 lists, and lurk on the others b/c I am a newbie at those topics, have little to offer but questions. 

Internet or not, remember that as a newbie you are a guest at a long term conversation. Easy to step on toes... 

Hang in there. 

Chris
