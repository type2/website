Subject: this waving bit

I have noticed thet I get quite a few more waves from your typical country farmers when I am driving my bus than when I had the Beetle.  I'm not sure if I know the reason for this, but one good ol' boy that I spoke with said that he had fond memories of the farm workhorse that they used to haul hay a couple of decades ago, the trusty '65 or '66 singlecab (he wasn't quite sure).  I'm not sure if this is the reason for farmer waves, as mine is a westy, but I have heard stories about the deep love many farmhands had for the lorry-style fold-down bed.  Great to load hay and the like!  No American p/u could compete with that versatility  (not to mention the good looks):)

As for other wavers, I get a lot of excited looks from teenage kids, and wistful looks from BMW and M-B owners (former Vdubbers?).  The bug population always waves at me, as well as other loaf drivers.  Kids on school busses seem to get the biggest kick out of the old girl, as it is pretty rare to see even a hint of a VW bus anywhere away from the University campus.

I am trying my darndest to change this.

I have already talked 2 of my busless friends into buying their own.  I see this as my little contribution to the continuing presence of loafs in East Tennessee.  It's a dirty job, but somebody has to do it!
