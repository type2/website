Roger-
Have had similar problems with my twin solex engine. The chokes help the
cold engine start, when it's warm it has to start on normal air flow. You
may have a vacuum leak somewhere that the chokes compensate for. Check
every vacuum connection including the brake vacuum assist that goes from
the manifolds to the front of the bus. Use some blue glue-like gasket
sealer, gob it on the outside of a connection, if there is a leak it will
get drawn in by the vacuum and hopefully stop the leak. Worth a try.
