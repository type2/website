&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt;     71&quot; bus, 1600 engine.  Should the gland nut that holds on the
&gt; flywheel have a little felt washer just forward of the pilot bearing?

IIRC, the felt is part of the pilot bearing which is normally sold with
the gland nut.  It might be separately replaceable.

I've run a long time without the felt washer with no problems,  Just
grease the bearing with really stiff grease (bosch distributor point
grease) and it should be fine.
