A couple of years back I ordered a complete exhaust system for my '71 bus
from Ron.  It arrived and I put it on the shelf to await a new engine
install.  Six months later I opened the boxes and discovered that the
tailpipe bracket and install kit was missing.

I emailed Ron with the info and he shipped the missing parts right out.
This was _six months_ after the purchase and Ron would have been well
within his rights to tell me to shove it, since I didn't take the time to
check the shipment when it arrived.  I cannot complain about that service.

I think that one problem is that folks are expecting instant service and
instant delivery simply because we have instant communication.  I've been
around a while and remember when a shipment from JC Whitney was
considered &quot;fast&quot; if it arrived in less than a month!  Back then you
really had to plan ahead!
