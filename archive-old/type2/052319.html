Subject: [T2] New NC bus club has a WEB PAGE!   (yay)

well the new nc bus club had its second meeting today (first for triangle
chapter) and i must say i had a good time and a good meal. somehow chris
talked me into creating the flyers and web site. sooo........

the website is up (that was quick, dontcha think?) and the address is
http://busclub.itgo_dot_com/ but there's a little problem. I don't really know
what i should put up on it, or on the flyer, so everyone that intends to
participate PLEASE pmail me some input! it's your club too, i'm just the
webmaster.

peace!
