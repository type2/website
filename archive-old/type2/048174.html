Hi Volks,
   Here's my answer to &quot;When you sleep in your camper, do you find it
more comfortable with your head to the front or to the rear?&quot;
   When the weather is warm and I can leave the rear hatch open, with the 
net snapped into place, I sleep with my head in the rear.  In cold weather I 
turn around and sleep with my head toward the front.
