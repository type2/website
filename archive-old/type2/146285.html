Subject: Re: [T2] 68 brake lines.

In a message dated 1/16/06 11:46:13 AM, andy_at_pon.type2_dot_com writes:


&gt; I broke 2 of the metal brake lines taking the old MC out to replace it.
&gt; Does anyone know the length of the 3 lines that connect to the MC?
&gt; Should I be able to just buy the correct length lines at any old flaps?
&gt; 
&gt;    FWIW, I &quot;try&quot; and have the short lines on hand before moving the MC.
I cheat and get slightly longer replacements...Putting a loop in the line
before loosely fitting one end helps to fit the other end. 'Course if I was 
really smart (and rich... ;-) I'd replace the whole system with Airoquip
lines and be done with it...
