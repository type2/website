Subject: RE: [T2] Re: Replacing battery tray

If fabricating your own tray, you may want to consider the water drain
hole.  I remember this being discussed some time back.  If memory serves
correct, someone suggested running a small length of tubing down from
the nipple of the factory tray.  This would allow water to escape that
comes through the air vents, but does not let water to splash up in it.

Have a good one,
Eric Shook
