Subject: Re: [T2] solid/hydraulic swap?

[...]

What a bunch of hooey.... sounds like a campaign speech from a politician!

All you need are 8 hydraulic lifters, 8 steel pushrods, 8 flat washers, 8 wave
washers, and 4 spacers.

You don't need a hydraulic cam. All these parts work on a solid cam.
They have worked fine so far on my 77 Westy and it has over 76000 miles on it.
Hard miles, I cruise on the freeway at 80-85 all day.
And they have worked fine so far on my daughters 77 Westy, for almost 100,000
miles.
[and I used the best USED lifters I could find from wrecking yard engines!!]


&gt; on 11/23/01 2:53 PM, you related:
&gt;
&gt; &gt; gang,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; what i'm wondering is, would it be
&gt; &gt; possible for me to rebuild the 76 engine, and just
&gt; &gt; swap the solid lifters for hydraulics. can this be
&gt; &gt; done?
&gt;
&gt; this is possible. there are things which need to be done. i may not get all
&gt; of them, but here goes:
&gt;
&gt; any stock vw hydraulic cams and lifters (from a core motor) will most likely
&gt; not be useable, so you will need a new cam. don't regrind, get a new one and
&gt; good new lifters. excellent cams are found here:
&gt;
&gt; http://www.webcaminc_dot_com/
&gt;
&gt; the case needs to be modified, but not drastically. the oil passages are
&gt; different. i can't be specific, but if you put up a post about what you want
&gt; to do on the type4um here...

&gt;
&gt; ...you will undoubtedly get a chorus of educated replies to your questions.
&gt; some may tell you not to switch: this solid/hydraulic debate is a hot one in
&gt; certain circles. i myself have just converted my 1979 bus motor to solid
&gt; lifters and a performance cam. there are benefits on either side of the
&gt; debate.
&gt;
&gt; the pushrods are different, as is some valvetrain hardware. the rocker
&gt; shafts on hydraulic motors have solid spacers and springy washers instead of
&gt; the flat washers and springs found on the solid heads. listmember terry kay
&gt; was doing this swap, then changed his mind, so he may have a bunch of these
&gt; bits.
&gt;
&gt; one HAS to ask why you feel the need to do this swap: is it because of
&gt; frequent valve adjustments? if so, this may be indicative of cam wear, or
&gt; even seat recession. once a cam begins to wear, it deteriorates rapidly.
&gt; hydraulic lifters on a bus motor are not a panacea. many knowledgeable
&gt; engine builders swear completely off them. others use them. the point is,
&gt; that while switching to hydraulic lifters may seem to be a problem-solver,
&gt; it is not that simple. there are different problems inherent in hydraulic
&gt; lifter motors that your solid motor does not have. if your motor is in need
&gt; of a rebuild anyways, you may be better off rebuilding a hydraulic motor
&gt; than assembling all the bits to turn yours into one. if your motor is in
&gt; good shape, then it might be cheaper to modify it.
&gt;
&gt; hope that helps.
