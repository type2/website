Listees,
I have a used Holly/Weber model 5200 carburetor set up for a Type IV motor
for sale. The kit came from Progressive Induction System, distributed by
Redline. It includes;  A Holley/Weber 5200 progresive carb (w/electric
choke) , cast aluminum manifold, steel runners (head to manifold
connections), chrome air cleaner w/ K&amp;N element,  manual &amp; instructions,
&quot;jet kit&quot; (over 30 air &amp; fuel jets), home make  hot air feed (attatches to
air cleaner w/ flex duct to hot air outlet ).  manifold is fitted with a
vacuum tap &amp; air cleaner has a fitting for line from oli seperator. 
I ran this set up on my old '74 camper, it was a real pain untill i
replaced the 009 dizzy with a stock unit w/ vacuum advance. Then it did
just fine. I replaced it with a pair of Dellortos when I had my &quot;big&quot; motor
built. The Dellortos do a good job in the pumpkin, but on cold mornings I
sure miss the choke on the Weber!
I'll take $ 75.00 + shipping. (OBO)
                                                                           
                  Ron Komoroski                                            
                                                                           
                                           '73 Westy w/penthouse poptop
