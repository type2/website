Hi Pat,

Sounds like you are doing the right thing.  Turn it on just a little in an open
space with no ignition sources.

If the point of leakage is not readily appearent, use a length of hose.  Hold
one end to your ear, and follow the lines and fittings from the tank to
wherever they lead to isolate the general location of the leak.  Then use a
soapy water soultion to brush on the the pipe or connecters to observe the leak
as the soap will be bubbling.  After the main leak is repaired, fully
pressurize the system and use the soapy water method to check all connections
for leakage.  Some times a small leak takes a few minutes to begin bubbling.  I
would suggest you check for leaks at least once a year.
