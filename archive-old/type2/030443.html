If you plan on a fair amount of gluing, and have access to an air
compressor, I'd recommend buying a cheap spray gun, then heading down to
your local auto-upolstery supply house.  Get a quart (hell, you may make
do with a pint..) of headliner glue.  They'll know exactly what your
talking about.;)

Many brands, many variations, but just generic vinyl top/headliner glue is
fine.;)

good luck...david
