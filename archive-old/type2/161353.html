Wouldn't you know it.  Formica discontinued this.  And Home Depot wants $60 for a 3'x8' sheet of something similar.  Anybody have any of this or know of anything similar.  I'm getting ready to do the cabinets.  Don't actually need very much as I'm not redoing them all.  Thanks....KR

&gt;
&gt; The wood-looking veneer is starting to peel on a
&gt; couple of my cabinet doors.  Any suggestions?  Can I
&gt; just buy the veneer and re-do everything?  Can you
&gt; still get the same veneer?
