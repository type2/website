&gt;&gt; Anyone else done anything similar?  It's going in the Award Winning

&gt;I have seen a very neat setup with a large radiator (to cool a Leyland 
V8 in the back of the bus) mounted flat under the front floor (under 
your feet up the front) with a scoop just below the front bumper 
feeding above the radiator. Sorry I don't have any pictures that I can 
find. The fan was below the radiator sucking through the radiator and 
blowing down. It was very neatly done (could even pass as factory

That seems a real neat solution.  I had an old article somewhere I've 
mentioned a couple times of a turbo diesel converted '74 or so where 
they used two small (well large for motorcylcle) radiators mounted at 
angles back in the rear sides sucking air through the stock air scoops, 
ducting them off for forced ram induction, and using single electric 
fans on each.  The guy toured it all over SA and Africa in the late 
80's, article was in a 85ish VW T&amp;A.  Good solution as although it 
required a lot of plumbing back in the engine compartment it didn't 
require any cutting.
