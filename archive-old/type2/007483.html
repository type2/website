Hi y'all,
     As I'm sure you already know, MacOS 8.5 has that cool find feature 
with the dumb name, to wit, Sherlock. As you may or may not also know, 
Sherlock can be programmed to search just about any internet style search 
engine. This being said, I'll bet you know where I'm going... 

;-)

I am pleased to announce the first release of the Type 2 archive Sherlock 
plug-in. Yes, that's right, search the archives from your desktop find 
utility, loads of fun for you and the family. Get your copy now at 
&lt;http://www.hintz_dot_org/pub/Type2.src.hqx&gt;. Once it's on your computer, 
drag and drop it on top of your *closed* system folder. The mac will ask 
if you want to put it where it goes(the &quot;Internet Search Sites&quot; folder). 
Say &quot;yes, you moron&quot; or some such, and click the OK button. If Sherlock 
is currently running, quit it, then open Sherlock and search away to your 
hearts content.

     A few notes: Currently, it views only by subject and author. 
Relevance information is not available, nor is the brief text 
description. This is due to the way the i405 archive displays the preview 
version. It makes the link a rather unreadable mess, something like 
&quot;type2_archive_blah/yada/snafu/666&quot;, which is unintelligible to mortal 
man. Therefore, I chose to go with the subject sort. Unfortunately, this 
result method does not include relevance or preview information-but it 
will display up to 200 subject lines alphabetically, so if the author 
used a reasonable one, you should be able to find it. The crosses we must 
bear. ;-) That being said, I think some of y'all may find this 
useful/fun/whatever.


Peace,
