Subject: Re: [T2] the thing between the fan and the crankshaft

Ta Da!

Thanks Tom and everyone else who reponded.  The 
push-it-off-with-its-own-bolts method worked so quickly and easily it 
almost scared me.

Jim (on to the next hang up!)

&gt;I've removed the fan hub on different engines perhaps a dozen or so times
&gt;and I've always used the following technique:
&gt;
&gt;Put some fairly heavy pieces of metal (I use big 'ol washers) behind the
&gt;&quot;ears&quot; of the hub, next to the case.  Insert your 3 fan bolts and tighten
&gt;then down until they just touch the metal pieces, effectively &quot;pining&quot; them
&gt;to the case.  Then go 'round and 'round tightening the bolts *very slightly*
&gt;(like, a 1/16th of a swing or so) and you'll eventually push the hub right
&gt;off.
