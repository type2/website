&lt;&lt; You really ought to look at this one.. A stretched VW high top with 
gazoodles of cabinetry and a Ford V6 engine!

Look under &quot;vehicle condition&quot;, for references to the creator of this odd VW 
hybrid and his meticulous habits. God knows how much money went into this 
project and now it's going for 1K. Looks pretty good, but why is the owner 
dumping it so cheap? Jan B &gt;&gt;

Unless it's a recognised &quot;kitcar&quot; - One from an established manufacturer like
Caterham or Spectre - It's hard to set a price, other than whatever someone
else will pay...Besides, I'd be curious as to the handling of this VW...It 
takes
an awful lot to &quot;stretch&quot; anything and keep all the bits in line. I'd hate to 
be
the one to find out that this thing has deficiencies at 60 mph...8-(
