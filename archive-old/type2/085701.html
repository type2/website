Subject: Urgent! Need help with alignment

Much to my chagrin, the brand new (and expensive!) front tires on my '71 
have worn their inside edges down to the flat rubber in less than 3,000 
miles. This after new ball joints last fall. The bus also has pulled 
slightly to the right ever since I bought it and the steering wheel has been 
a little off center.

Having owned motorcycles and understanding the gyroscopic effects of a 
turning wheel, I surmised the front end was toed out instead of in (which 
would cause the tires to &quot;lean&quot; inward and wear the inside edges). I 
measured yesterday and they were in fact toed out about 3/4&quot;. I've corrected 
it as best I can and I think they're now about right (0-1/8&quot; toed in), but 
the bus still pulls right, perhaps even a little stronger now. The notches 
on the camber adjustors point forward, as they should, and they *look* 
right, but I'm starting to wonder if the camber is wrong. Incidentally, the 
steering is now a bit more off-center.

Million dollar question: Will re-centering the steering via the drag link 
correct the pull to the right, or is one of my tires off-camber? In other 
words, does the position of the steering worm affect the way a front end 
&quot;pulls&quot;?

I'm leaving for a 3,000-mile roadtrip in 5 days. I, and my tires, will thank 
you kindly for any insight into this most urgent dilemma.

By the way, I don't really trust any shop in the area to do this better than 
I can ... and for $80, I'd rather screw it up myself.

Thank you in advance!
