&gt; Well, I've developed an irritating problem with my '73 Safare (1700cc,
&gt; Dual Kadrons), where the last few times I have really had to put my
&gt; foot into the brakes (steep hills and yellow lights etc) she will start
&gt; to stall and if I dont catch it she stalls out completely.

It may be the carb float, as Mr. Chubb suggests... I don't know beans
about carbs.

Let me suggest, however, that a torn diaphram in the disc brake booster
can produce these symptoms.  The way to check for this is to put a vacuum
gauge on the engine, start it up and have someone stand on the brakes as
you watch the gauge.  NOTE: the parking brake *must* be off for this test
to be valid.  The vacuum guage may bobble a bit when the brakes are
applied, but should return to &quot;normal&quot; (15&quot; or better of vacuum) almost
instantly.  If it drops and stays down until the brakes are released, then
the diaphram in your booster is tearing.

OOK!
