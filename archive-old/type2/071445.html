Subject: Cooling Tin Question?
Message-ID: &lt;da673333.24777670_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Help, I'm in the process of putting an engine back together and can't figure 
out where the two small pieces of cooling tin go.  This is a 1973, 1600 
upright engine, with doghouse style oil cooler.  The two small pieces of tin 
each have two bolt holes, are irregular shape, 6-8 inches long.  My guess is 
they came off the front by the pulley but I don't really know?  Any help 
would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks, My favorite Murphy's law &quot;You can't fall off the floor&quot;
