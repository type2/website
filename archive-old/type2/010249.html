      Hey Type 2 owners,
  I recently purchased a 1973 Bus. It's still a work
in progress. The one thing that eludes me is, the name
for the bus. It's not a Kombi, Westy, or Camper.
Here's a brief body description: On the Driver's side
there's no panel with windows. In other words there's
no windows on that side, it's all paneled off. Every
dealer of parts and mechanics I've talked to have
never seen one of these before. And personally I've
never seen one either. If anyone knows the proper VW
name for my bus, let me know please. Thanks.
