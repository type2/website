Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for a '76-'79 Westy Deluxe


Ok, I guess I got carried away with the &quot;deluxe&quot; model.  Here are the
features that I had in my old one:

Green, 2000 engine FI, Manual tranny, Stove (2 propane burners w/tank
under sliding door), Sink w/pump, Fridge (AC &amp; Battery), westfalia
camper model that sleeps two on top and two on the bottom, table in
back, little table for up front that stood on one pole, hammock in the
front, umm.. can't think of anything else right now..

I thought the difference between the deluxe and the standard was the
icebox or the fridge, but I guess I was mistaken; my bad ;)

But yeah, I'm thinking anything up to 79.  Were there any major
changes/improvements on the later models ~79?  I've only had 76s...  I
wouldn't mind having electronic ignition if it was offered stock on
later models...

thanks,
Mike

&gt; Hey there Mike,
&gt; 
&gt; Yep, 79 is the last year of the baywindow. 80 is the first year of
&gt; the vanagon.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;From what I've seen Sage Green was available from 76-79 on the
&gt; Westies. BUT the deluxe wasn't offered in green in all those years.
&gt; (Karl, help me out here if I'm missing some details).
&gt; 
&gt; Since you're looking for a GREEN westy DELUXE, 1979 is not going to
