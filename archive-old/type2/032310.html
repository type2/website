Subject: Transmission questions


 I switched transmissions today and some things came to my surprise. My
intent was to replace what I thought to be the original gearbox in my '74
Westy with one that I got from a '73 bus with only 92,000 orig miles. (The
bus was from Nantucket, you can't really drive that far there, only in
circles :) for $150 from the local vw guy. After a few hours of pain I had
the transmissions side by side. The one that I took out was a 5 rib
tranny(!). I thought these were only used in '75.I had never really
given it much notice other than the 002 marking. My bus is dated
2/74. Did they put 5 rib tranny's into any busses previous to 1975, or is
this not the first transmission that this bus has seen?


 There were also a few other differences with the transmissions. The
5 rib, 002 tranny i took out had
the ground strap on the driver's side and the '73 was on the
opposite. The bus was meant to have it connect on the drivers side, I will
need to make a modification when I am finished installing the '73


 Also There is some kind of sender switch screwed into the very
rear of the '73 tranny (its not the back up light switch, this one is on
the very rear, up and right of the gear shift lever) It is 2 prong and has
a wire on one prong connecting to the same bolt as the ground
strap, obviously a ground connection. The 5 rib tranny did not have
this. What is it?



Some background info that might be useful:
 it is definately a '74 bus, VIN is '74, door date is 2/74 and there were
no provisions for fuel injection when i got it. It does now though. Got it
with no engine and installed a '75 1800 with all the fuel injection. The
odmeter reads 10,500. This could be 310,500 or even more. All I know is
that in 1985 it had 185,000. The transmission that i took out was very
worn. It was leaking pretty bad, made some awful grinding noises and
didn't like to downshift into 2nd. 

When I finish with my CV joints (after my axle mishap) tomorrow she will
be with a nice '73 transmission from Nantucket :)


thanks
