Subject: Re: [T2] ugly bus/van entry

omg, my kids went NUTS! it really is the ugliest thing i have ever
seen... good thing it WASNT a VW~!
my son identified togepe, jiggly puff, charizard, cubone, bulbasar, mew
and pikachu. there were others, but the pic was too hazzy to tell. i am
not sure it was mew, but i couldnt make that one out, either. thought i
saw squirtle's head behind bulbasar.

sorry for the poke-rant

&gt; Can it actually move with all that down force?
&gt; Y'know it's almost beautiful in it's excess...There seems to be
&gt; at least two or at least twice as much of anything I've ever seen 
&gt; on a car. The airbrush scene seems the most subdued thing on
&gt; it tho'...
