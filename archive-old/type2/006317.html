*SNIP*

&gt;It is hard for me to believe that pressure is
&gt; actually negative in the engine compartment when the bus is at freeway
&gt; speed.

I have stuff to add, but it's related to engine cooling, NOT your heat
output (so I won't add it).

&gt; I have definitely noticed that the output of my heater is strongly
dependent
&gt; on my rate of travel, i.e. very low when I am at idle and more and more as
my
&gt; speed increases.

The heater fan (electric) is only there to keep air volume up AT IDLE. Look
closely at the system! Most of the heater air comes FROM THE COOLING FAN.
There are supposed to be one-way flapper valves on the fan shroud assembly
(most are missing; having been removed by &quot;mechanics&quot;). These valves are
right at the heater box/shroud junction. The way they work is that the
vehicle always gets AT LEAST the volume from the electric fan. If the
engine's fan exceeds this amount, the valves close and you get air from
there instead.

&gt; Heater air is also drawn out of the engine compartment by
&gt; the heater fan, then pushed through my leaky heater boxes and all the long
&gt; way up to the front of the bus. The speed of the heater fan does not vary.

Do this: turn your heat on (electric fan off), and rev the engine up. See
what happens.

&gt; The only other thing I can think of that might affect this system is
positive
&gt; pressure in the engine compartment when driving at speed. If there is in
fact
&gt; negative pressure in the engine compartment at speed as you assert then
&gt; please explain to me how it is that I get a lot more air out of my heater
&gt; vents at speed while getting almost nothing at idle. There is a strong
&gt; positive correlation between heater air into the passenger compartment
&gt; and rate of travel.

There also happens to be a correlation with vehicle speed and engine RPMs.

;-)

&gt; If air pressure in the engine compartment were
&gt; negative, as you assert, then I would expect my heater to push less air
&gt; at speed, not more, because it would be laboring against a pressure
&gt; gradient.
&gt;
&gt; If there were negative pressure in the engine compartment at speed, as you
&gt; assert, then I would expect engineering solutions that put more cool air
in
&gt; the engine compartment to enhance engine cooling.

Why? If the stock system is adequate, why? If there is a problem, the
engineers likely would have. It only adds cost.

&gt; Things like extra air
&gt; scoops or bigger air scoops would enhance cooling. Why then didn't those
wise
&gt; VW engineers do it that way? Why are these not popular after market
&gt; modifications?

because it's already adequate WHEN EVERYTHING IS THERE (it's often not).


&gt; &gt; This is also why having ALL the engine tin and sealing rubber in place
is so
&gt; &gt; vital. One small piece of tin missing (or rip in the seal) and your
engine
&gt; &gt; temps shoot up.
&gt;
&gt; It is definitely a good idea to have all tin and seals in place if air
&gt; pressure is positive in the engine compartment at speed. If air pressure
&gt; were negative as you assert then I would expect missing tin on the
&gt; leading edge of the engine to let cool air in and enhance cooling of the
&gt; engine. It is not efficient for cooling to make the cooling system labor
&gt; against a pressure gradient to get cooling air. Obviously it is also not
&gt; good to let hot air leak back into the system in any way.
&gt;

how about this. Why don't you remove your rear engine tin (all of it), and
drive 70mph on the highway in the summertime. Tell us how many miles you get
before your engine siezes. If the engine compartment is in fact POSITIVE
pressure, it won't matter will it?

The problem a little more complex: the engine compartment is a LOWER
pressure than immediately beneath the engine (where all the hot air pumped
FROM the engine bay is exhausted to).

It really doesn't matter too much what the engine compartment's absolute
pressure is, what matters is how it COMPARES to the air pressure immediately
below the engine (HOT air). If you increased the pressure of the air in the
engine compartment, you would also end up increasing it below the engine
(that's where the fan is pumping all the air to).

I still say that if it was so simple, VW would have done it in a second.
