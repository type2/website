If you're not worried about being 100% original, you can get rolls of automotive carpeting at most auto parts stores, like Pep Boys, Trak,etc. It is fairly thin stuff, easy to mold around corners. I used this stuff on the sides of my old '76 Westy because at the time (3 yrs. ago) the side pieces were not available, only the top mats were. It looked pretty good. I glued it on with a hot glue gun, and it stuck pretty well, never came off. I'll probably do the same on my current resto on the '77, as my budget took a big hit this week with the purchase of an HVLP spray gun and all the paint and supplies I need to start painting, hopefully this weekend.
