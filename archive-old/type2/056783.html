Subject: 250 degrees: too high?

On a recent trip of 75 miles on the interstate,  the oil temperatuure in
the 1776 in my '71 Westy was hanging above 240 for most of the trip and
occasionally hit 250.   I don't feel comfortable taking the bus on another
trip.

Does anyone have actual experience running at temperatures this high?
Should I pull the engine and rebuild to a 1600, kissing off my substantial
investment in heads, cylinders, etc.?

Jack
