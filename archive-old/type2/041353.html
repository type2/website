Jeff,
I'd love to have a scanned version of the Hot Vw's Bus spring job. I'm also
very patient.

&gt;
&gt; HotVWs did a story on raising the sagging rear-end of a bus. I think it
was
&gt; a 71 camper. I saved a series of articles they did while fixing up this
&gt; camper. It would make a great set of web pages except for copyright
issues.
&gt; I'll take a look for it and scan it for emailing if your interested.
You'll
&gt; have to be patient though.
&gt;
&gt; My infamous VW mechanic refuses to fix mine unless there is a problem like
&gt; bad bushings because it is such a bear getting them apart and back
together
&gt; you just don't do it for a sagging rear end. He wants to sell me
coil-overs
&gt; (&quot;stiffies&quot;) for the rear-end to fix it. I actually lean towards lowering
&gt; the front a little bit, except that is harder and more expensive then
&gt; raising the back.
&gt;
&gt; PS The PC game Beetle Buggin is great fun for $20. I haven't played it
&gt; enough yet to get my hands on the busses, but I'm looking forward to it.
My
&gt; wife is much happier with me playing a driving game rather then a shooter.
&gt; Thanks for the tip!!
&gt; PPS Now you know why you have to be patient :-)
