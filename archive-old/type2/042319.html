Justin,
You replaced the heads on this engine, didn't you?
I would readjust the valves ( they are proly tight, from the seating process
in the first few hundred miles),  if you have points check the dwell.  Check
your carburetor air/ fuel mixture setting, idle setting,  and, replace the
fuel filter.

As another listee once said:  When something in a Bus doesn't work right it
usually isn't just one thing that's wrong.....

&gt; I have had my 71 westy on the road for two weeks after a 10 year
&gt; hibernation.
&gt;
&gt; Question 1: I have noticed that when cold, she will not idle at all.  When
I
&gt; am at a stop light she just falls right on her face.  However, when warm
&gt; (after being ran for about 10 minutes) it idles very healthily.
&gt;
&gt; Question 2:  If I do not REALLY race the engine before I let the clutch
out,
&gt; it will want to stall.  It also chugs and acts like it is missing when
under
&gt; load.  I usually compensate by downshifting but I think 50 mph in 3rd is a
&gt; little hard on the motor.
&gt;
&gt; Any suggestions welcome (within the boundaries of good taste : ))
&gt;
