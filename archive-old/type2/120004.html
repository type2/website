Subject: Engine Recommendations

Hi all,

I'm the proud owner of a '72 Westy and have recently joined the list. I'm a 
newb and know squat about VWs. Since joining, I've already learned tons from 
reading all your posts (like what the source of the strong gas smell might 
be; and that VWs should start when it's below freezing -- mine doesn't). 
Thanks!

I'm wondering what you might recommend. I've learned that my engine is not the 
original. I think it's an 1800 out of a beetle (I could post a small jpeg of 
it if that would help someone identify it). Also, it's missing the engine tin 
and was driven that way all last summer. It leaks oil in a few places, so 
maybe it overheated?

I'd like to have an engine that has a good balance of power and fuel economy 
(maybe more on the fuel economy side). I would like to rebuild it, but should 
I try and find a type 4 (or some other engine) or rebuild the one I have?

If I can get the thing finished in time, it would be great to join the group 
on the PEI trip, but I'll need a head start 'cause I'm in Alberta  :)
