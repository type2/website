Subject: FS: '82 Vanagon

'81 Vanagon, 130k original miles, 35k on rebuilt engine, runs strong
    FS:  '82 Vanagon, air-cooled 2.0 liter engine; 135k original miles, 33k on
rebuilt engine. Strong-running engine -- loves the freeway!  All maintenance
records. Just smogged.  Converted from 8-passenger van to sleeper van for two
and-or big cargo space for surfer or commercial hauler.  Stick shift,
bench-style front seat.  Located in San Francisco.

    Negatives:

 --New clutch only 10,000 miles ago but clutch chatter can occur when
starting-out on uphill grade. A reliable  mechanic says it's due to clutch
installer's failure to resurface the flywheel when new clutch was installed.
Otherwise clutch/shifting functions are excellent.

--Transaxle is original, some whine perceptible at low speeds.

--Gas gauge unreliable.

--Body in decent shape but some rust spots in the paint.

    Selling because bought an air-cooled '82 Westphalia camper van, a virtual
twin, so this one has got to go.

    Price: $1,450 firm. amcginn_at_microweb_dot_com or 415 387-5467
