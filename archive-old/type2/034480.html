Subject: free door seal 

in the spirit of spreading good karma..i found a few items in the
garage i have decided to donate.  maybe post 1 or 2 a week, till gone.


free door seal:
211 831 722 DBL
68-79 T2
BLEM

i got this in a box of stuff last year at the bandimere denver
speedway bug show. it is a ROCKY MOUNTAIN MOTORWORKS part.  i do not
need it.  it says BLEM, meaning it is a second.  i looked it over and
do not see any evidence of tearing, etc.  it is NEW, unused!!  

do NOT respond unless you could actually use this door seal...please. 

(obviously free within reasonable shipping distances...lets not get
carried away here!!)
