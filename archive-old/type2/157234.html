&gt; I decided to check the points today just to see if
&gt; there happened to
&gt; be a coincidence between the sluggishness and the
&gt; new AFM.  The point
&gt; were dead on (that's a first).
&gt; 
&gt; With the original AFM, the fuel pump had been
&gt; operating as soon as I
&gt; would turn the key to the &quot;on&quot; position.  Now that I
&gt; have a spared
&gt; AFM, I cracked the black cover open and fixed the
&gt; fuel pump safety
&gt; contacts by adjusting the lever that operates the
&gt; contacts.  I put the
&gt; original AFM back in.  The sluggishness is
&gt; completely gone but, the
&gt; engine does not run as smoothly with the original
&gt; AFM as with the new
&gt; AFM.  I might be imagining it but, I think the
&gt; engine tends to
&gt; backfire more with the original as opposed to the
&gt; new.  I'll have to
&gt; swap  them back again to be sure but, it is
&gt; backfiring almost every
&gt; time I let off the gas right now.
Ken - It sounds to me as if you have a rich condition
with the original AFM and maybe the &quot;new&quot; one is not
right for your engine. I don't remember - did you jump
through all the hoops before deciding on changing the
AFM, or was it just an easy tool that you figured
would help in diagnoses? I'm thinking it's mucked up
your diagnoses... Don't get too involved with mixture
adjustment screw. It's pretty much an idle thing
although it does have some influence up higher. It's
simply an air bypass port, similar to the air bypass
port that adjusts your idle speed. I think you really
need to look at all the causes for rich conditions -
that is, after you have pulled every vacuum hose off
the engine and inspected it carefully and re attached!
 Check your fuel pressure with vacuum to the pressure
regulator and with no vacuum to the pressure
regulator.  
Unplug the coldstart injector. If neither of those
offers a clue, check the resistance at temp sensor #2
and at temp sensor #1. Finally, leave your pressure
gauge hooked up to the high pressure port after
sutting the engine off and see how quickly the
pressure drops off. It should hold for a few minutes
although I cannot remember the specs and am too tired
to look it up for you just now - sorry. Put a clamp on
the return line after the pressure regulator. Move the
clamp forward of the pressure regulator... to find
where the leakage occurs. You have air getting into
your exhaust system also, so is there a blockage of
the exhaust that contributed to blowing out a/some
gasket(s)? Air filter new and dry? Fuel tank venting
properly? Sorry if you have posted that you already
checked all that stuff. Let us know as you go. -BaH
