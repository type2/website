grab it.

&gt; the catch:  the engine won't stay running.  by this i mean it starts right 
&gt; up every time, but as soon as the foot is taken off the gas the engine 
&gt; stalls out.  the owner told me that he spent over $400 on a new fuel pump, 
&gt; fuel pump relay, and air flow sensor.  and it still won't stay running.  now 

temp sensor.
accel linkage adjusted wrong
vacuum leak.

they would be my first culprits, check em in reverse order as that is the
likely problem order
