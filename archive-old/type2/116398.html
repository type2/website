Subject: Re: [T2] I'm gonna pull my engine

&gt;Um... I thought that I had a T4 engine, in a T2?  &gt;Pancake?

You do, because you have a 72-79 bus which had them in north america, 68-71 buses and all buses before them had the type1 engine, sometimes referred to as a type2 engine because it was installed in the bus.

Using this logic, you could also call the type4 engine installed in the type2 a type2 engine.

I like to stick with types 1 and 4.

Billy
