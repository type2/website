&gt; I noticed a couple of you mentioned &quot;jumping&quot; the starter.  Care to explain
&gt; how?
&gt; I just had a shop rebuild mine, the supported auto trans type on my 1600,
&gt; and I'll be dang if it isn't doing it again.

well one way is to use a screwdriver across the terminals at the starter,
what I have done is run a heavy wire from the soenoid to a switch in the
engine comp, then directly to battery, have it mounted to the top of the
engine comp near the battery.
  while I put it in for &quot;bumping&quot; the engine when working on it, but if
the ignition switch is on the engine can be started with it also.
