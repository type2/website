&gt; manifold/decel-valve/pressure-regulator by 4-way tee, instead of the usual
&gt; 3-way.

Well, karl is having computer problems. But he will definitely be more help
on this one than myself, I've pretty much jeffed this thread up completely.

79 cal bus does have retard on the throttle body, though. I still have the
sticker and it is clearly indicated.
