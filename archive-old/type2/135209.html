&gt; The fact that they sell GEX engines is the reason I don't buy ANYTHING 
&gt; from Cip1. That and why would a company in another state use 
&gt; California in the name?!?!?! Makes one wonder... 
&gt; 
Maybe they were once actually based in CA. The more likely explanation is the image/emotions they want to evoke from potential customer. CA after all was the birthplace of the kewel cal look hot rod vw scene. Just muy guess though.
