Subject: Front Shift Rod Bushing Replace

Hello All -
I have a 79 bus.  Recently I acquired a new front shift rod bushing (a.k.a.
shift guide) to replace the mangled, sloppy-shifting-causing rubber/plastic
disc thing that is up in there now, hanging by a thread if still there at
all.  Looking at the old bushing some time ago, I assumed that a replacement
would involve just greasing up the new bushing and sliding it into the
&quot;peace pipe&quot; end of the shift rod, working it in so that it seals correctly
into its groove.  But, someone just told me that it is much more involved
that that -- as in having to somehow loosen/disconnect the shift rod and
slide it back in order to get/fit the bushing in there.  Is this true and if
so, can someone step me through this process?  I don't want to get under
there and start unbolting rods willy-nilly without having some guidance to
work from.  Thanks for your help!
