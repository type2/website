Subject: Re: Mounting spare on front of 74 bus

Hi Volks!

Unfortunately, the opposite is true.

The '73-'79 Bay has pretty good crash protection, although
it doesn't look like it.  If you remove the front bumper,
you see it's attached to a crumple-zone-like structure.
This takes the energy, and distributes what it can't
take into the frame.  Look underneath: there are Y-shaped
frame members to stabilize the crumple zone at the 
corners, and direct energy into the frame.

Now, if you attach the spare tire to the front, what
happens in an accident is that not the bumper and crumple
zone take the energy from the first impact, but the spare
tire does.  A tire is a relatively soft thing, but a rim
isn't.  So the energy can't compress the rim, and the rim
is pushed into the front of the bus -- which isn't built
to take that kind of stress.  Result: the front sheet metal,
fresh air ducts and everything, are pushed into the cabin.

I've seen crash pictures with front mounted spare tires
that look quite bad.

That's why post-'73 Westies had the spare tire nose: the
tire sits further down, inside the crumple zone, and 
distributes the impact energy into the frame, instead of
the front sheet metal.

What can be done?

Make or obtain some brackets to mount the bumper further
to the front.  Make them sturdy.  They need to be able to
take the impact energy without folding, and distribute
it into the crumple zone.  They need to be stronger
than the crumple zone itself, and boy, that *is* strong.

German TÜV, which is quite anal in such things, only
allows a front mounted spare tire with a bumper set to
the front like that.  They also require that the front
ends of the bumper be covered so as not to threaten
pedestrians and cyclists; and if you've ever walked into
such a bumper, you'll understand why.

My advice would be: do set your bumper forward.  Be
happy that you don't have such strict authorities, yeah,
but why not learn from them anyway?

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
