Matt,

Suggestions:

Disconnect the injectors on one side of the engine, pull the fuel rail back
so you can see if the injectors are firing. Crank the engine. You should see
the injectors pulse out gas once every revolution of the engine. Testing the
injectors with a test light just left you scratching your head - the proof
is in the pudding - do the injectors fire? Since your plugs were dry, I'm
guessing that the injectors are not firing. Yet your test lamp test
suggested that they should be firing.

Question:

What kind of ignition do you have on your '79? The reason I ask is that
Preston and I just ran across an interesting problem with his FI and the
ignition signal the ECU uses. We put a Tiger 581 CD module on his bus. With
this module the points no longer driver current thru the coil, but instead
signal the CDI to drive current thru the coil. The same signal from the
points drives tells the ECU to fire the injector. With the CDI (signal at
points goes from 0 to 12 v as you turn the engine over) the ECU would not
fire. The problem is the ECU (transplanted from an '83 Vanagon) needed the
high voltage spike that the coil delivers when the points are opened in
order to fire the injectors. Our short term solution was to put a SECOND
coil back in the circuit so that the signal from the points once again has
the high voltage spike.
Conclusion: If you have something other that regular old points/coil
ignition, this may be a problem.

Let us know if the injectors are firing or not. There is a wealth of
experience on FI here in all the list members.

Good luck!
