Subject: oil additive advice

Hi all,

I want to thank everybody who contributed to answering my question, I hope 
this fart didn't tick anybody off.  Now that you mention it I would have to 
agree that if any one of the products worked as well as advertised then it 
would come from the factory.... good point, I hadn't thought of that.  I am 
going to play it safe and stick with what I know works.  I think that 
sensible driving and consistant maintence is going to have much more 
rewarding benefits than any cheezy product out there.  I apologize for my 
sudden lapse in jugment.  Keep it real :)
