Subject: Re: [T2]Been ROBBED? Lock up your fuel.

Regarding installing a lock on the fuel door, I have posted some PICS of my 
lock which can be viewed here.
A pretty simple idea that works but the purists may cringe.

If you go to your local hardware store you can buy this lock for about $5.00, 
this one measures about 1-1/4&quot; just over 3 cm long along the threaded portion 
of the cylinder.
If you have access to a panel punch this will be easy but if you don't then I 
recommend a sheet metal &quot;step&quot; bit which can be purchased from Harbor freight 
for about $25.00 (they also have panel punch sets) 
The hole is centered on the door 1&quot; or 2.5 cm from the edge of the door to 
the center of the lock cylinder.
The slot for the cam latch can be created with a dremmel tool.

Any how this lock has kept my fuel safe from pilferage for 20 years.

Have fun!
Rusty
