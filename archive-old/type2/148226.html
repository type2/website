Subject: Re: [T2] air tools

Boy, have you ever got that straight! I bought a whole slew of air
tools spec matched to my $99 HF compressor, only to find it only puts
out enough air to power the tools for a minute at a time, or in the
case of my impact, not at all! I wrote them a nasty letter, but they
were not interested enough to respond.

&gt; It's often advertizing to get you to buy the tool for your tool small
compressor. Only later do you discover you have terrible duty cycle because
the tool requires so much CFM to run full time.
