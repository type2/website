&lt;&lt; That's funny.. in 3 years of driving a Vanagon, I have never been pulled 
over for anything.  Even when there were obvious reasons to pull me over 
(light out, speeding, etc.)  However, during the 2 years I owned a 280ZX I 
was searched over 10 times.  Go figure.

Haven't had it out in a while, but driving my Bugeye is usually good for at 
least
one meeting with the Federales...Mostly it's just to find out 
what-the-hell-kind-
of-car-is-this by cops at least 10 to 15 years younger than the car...
