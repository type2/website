I couldn't agree more.  I have one of the first run of vanagon.lenti shirts 
that is over five years old, and it still looks great.  This ain't no 
dime-store T-shirt!  Also, I was lucky enough to catch Richard early in the 
day at Everybus last year and snag one of the last of the Search and Rescue 
shirts - he sold out minutes later.  There were lots of people there who, 
after seeing the shirts were disappointed that they couldn't get 
one.  Okay, it wasn't all luck - I knew from experience that they would go 
quickly.  Moral of the story is that pre-ordering is a good thing if you 
don't want to get left out!
