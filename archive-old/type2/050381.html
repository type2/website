Subject: [T2] Re: CV knocking

Jim Mowreader responded to a question about what is a &quot;cv&quot; and could it be 
causing a knocking under conditions of acceleration, after having driven a 
Van for some bit of time. Jim's description of the test for looseness (like 
doing a bench press on each end of the half shaft) to determine if the cv 
was the likely source of the knocking was very picturesque, but may not be 
sufficiently sensitive for a  proper diagnosis.
My experience with exactly the same phenomenon was that before there was 
measureable looseness, the knocking after some hour or so of driving 
phenomenon was actually caused by insufficient lubrication in the joint, 
which over time if unattended to will no doubt cause the looseness that 
Jim's technique will detect.
But you shouldn't wait that long. In fact many Van owners aren't aware that 
preventive maintenance calls for the cv's to be examined for need of 
lubrication every 30-60,000 miles. This is true even when the boots are 
patent because the grease leaks out of the flange very slowly, almost 
imperceptibly, and appears as a uniform scum on the outside of the 
flange/joint. Sooner or later if the boot doesn't tear first, the joint will 
run low of lube and that is when you begin to hear clicking under load after 
driving for a while. I was fooled for a long time thinking the engine was 
pinging*, when all along it was just an under-lubbed joint.
So my advice is as soon as you hear such a clicking, remove the half shaft 
and add some molybdenun-based grease to the joints at both ends, then do the 
other shaft as well because it too will start clicking sooner or later. I 
haven't gone so far as to schedule this for p.m., but those who are into 
such fastidious activities may well want to add this to their list.

*You can distinguish this from pinging because the click rate is exactly 
proportional to velocity not to r.p.m., which at a given velocity will be at 
a different rate depending upon what gear you are using.
