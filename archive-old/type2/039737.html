&gt; &gt;OK, I'll bite!  How often will a 90A (or even 45A) alternator truly see
&gt; &gt;full load?  90A at 13V is 1170W, and unless you plan to heat the bus
&gt; &gt;electrically I don't see any way to use this much power.  Unless you plan
&gt; &gt;on installing a pirate radio station and driving it around the country I
&gt; &gt;doubt that you'll use the amps!
&gt; 
&gt; I could see 90 amps being used up easily.  One thing most people forget to 
&gt; factor in is that the engine's ignition system takes a significant amount 
&gt; of power.  four spark plugs firing 2,000 times per minute (at 
&gt; 4000rpm).  That's at least 5-10 amps right there.  Then you add radio, 
&gt; lights, fans, wipers, A/C (if applicable), CB radio, gauges... it all adds 
&gt; up.  Throw some monster amps in there and you could blow 90 amps right 
&gt; outta the water.

Well, I have instrumented to measure actual current draw (not
charge/discharge) and never saw more than 25 amps, and that was with all
systems on full blast.  You might be able to pull more current with big
audio amps, but if the draw is continous the sound level will be such
that you won't be able to occupy the bus unless you are between the ages
of 14 and 18!

Of course, extra capacity doesn't hurt, but the stock bus generator is
more than enough for my needs, even with several amateur radio rigs and
a stereo adding to the load.
