Subject: Re: [T2] Thermostat- to fit or not to fit?

greetings Matt,
	You left out some information such as what year/type of engine is
in your bus, but since your are living in jolly ole England, I'm going
to make the assumption (which may be incorrect) that this is a type 1
engine. So here is what I can offer. Many guys stateside have pulled
off the thermostats et. al. for years over here. It works decent,
depending on where you live. But it isn't correct. I don't have a
complete t1 to doublecheck, but I believe the flaps always default to
open. That is the springs which hold the flaps try to keep the flaps
open so that it's the t'stat which operates against it. A sticking
flap is incorrect. One kept in good shape shouldn't do this. If you
value what small amount of heat you can salvage from an air-cooled
engine in the winter, I would seek the flaps :)

Oh, one other thing, I would ask VEGE what temps they consider
overheated at. Granted this is no spec number from VW, but w/ that
information &amp; a oil temp gauge installed you might have some data to
back you up if anything goes wrong with this engine.
