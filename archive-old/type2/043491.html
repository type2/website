 The question is, how well will the engine tin and
 other components fit? My dead engine is a 1600 SP 
 with the non-doghouse oil cooler. The new longblock 
 is a 1600 DP with doghouse oil cooler.
 
 I know I will have to get an oil cooler stand, fan 
 shroud, and intake manifold. Will there be anything 
 else?

to convert from inhouse to doghouse,   you need:

doghouse fan (wider)
DH fan shroud
sort of triangular piece that vents the air from DH
rectangularish tube that vents the DH heated air out of engine compartment
seals for these vent bits
front tin  with hole for the DH rectangular vent
rectangular piece aka Hoover bit
oil cooler stand
oil cooler
4 oil cooler seals
the DH thermostat linkage to replace the non DH horizontal thermostat linkage

myself I would stay with SP for reliability, but it's your motor.  have fun!!
