&gt; I'd put pretty long odds on if the system is still working and
&gt;leak-free.  Usually the hoses are cracked or the valve is shot.  Be
&gt;prepared to depressurize the tank if you see a drip from behind the
&gt;dash.
&gt;
&gt;Common practice is to put an electric pump in-line between the tank
&gt;and the nozzles, bypassing the valve in the windshield wiper switch.
&gt;To control the pump, install a pushbutton next to the windshield wiper
&gt;switch.  This method is much more positive and troublefree.

Except that mine is still working flawlessly since I replaced the valve and
put some new tubing in. They can be revived and the purists among us might
like to know that.

 But I just know it won't go another 26 years. :)
