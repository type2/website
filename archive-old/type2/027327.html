Hi Volks,
   Since today is friday I'd like to share with you a poem that I wrote 
about this time last year.  I hope it makes you laugh or at least chuckle.


Winter in a VW Bus

Not a month before Christmas
and all cross the land,
bus owners are driving
with ice scrapers in hand.

They’re scraping without
and they’re scraping within,
to see where they’re going
and where they’ve just been.

With a little warm air
that passes for heat,
we loose feeling in our fingers
our ears and our feet

So we put on our hats
our gloves and more sox,
endure the cold weather
in our german icebox.

Winter is long
and it’s cold and it’s dark,
but these busses we drive
have a place in our heart

Without a complaint
or hardly a care,
we wait for warm weather
summer to bear.



Paul A.
Huntington Station, New York
71 westy - John Dear
