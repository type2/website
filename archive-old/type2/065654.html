Subject: Re: Cockpit partition? How to.

&gt;Has anyone designed a successful cockpit partition (you know to keep the
&gt;heat up front).  I have considered doing this but there are many options.
&gt;I suppose curtains would be easiest but you cant see out the back window.
&gt;What else is there?
&gt;Brett

The cockpit partition is a good idea.  I made one last winter and used it
with great success in my 71 westy.  Mine was made out of rectangular peices
of foam about 8&quot; x 12&quot; stacked flat behind the front seats from floor to
ceiling and over the sink and rear facing seat forming a complete wall.

A more convenient method would be to cut one from one or more pieces of 4 -
6&quot; thick foam sheet - it can't be much thinner than this or it won't hold
up well.  Several pieces would make it easier to install and remove and to
install and remove the window described below.

An opening could be cut allowing you to see out the rear window as well.
It wouldn't have to be very large - just well positioned.  And you might
even put in a sheet of thin acrylic or plexi-glass.  Two sheets with an
airspace between them would have some insulating value as well.  Just cut
shallow slots in the edges of the &quot;frame&quot; for the clear panel to fit into.
6&quot; foam is surprisingly stable in this kind of application and would
support the weight just fine.

Dryer vent hose can be used to bring heat from an auxiliary gas heater, if
you have one that works, to the front of the bus through the partition.
Wrapping a blanket around the hose reduces heat loss.  If your stock heat
exchangers are also connected you will be quite comfortable, unless the
front door seals leak alot.  I keep meaning to replace mine but I just keep
my jacket on instead. :-)

The shape would have to be carefully cut in order to get a snug fit. but
foam is flexible and you can ignore small irregularities, and use thin
strips of the leftovers to caulk it with.

Sears used to sell foam sheets but furniture makers and re-upholsterers are
another possibility.

Hope this helps some of you stay warm this winter.
