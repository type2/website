Subject: [T2] North Carolina Bus Club meeting in Triangle area

Hi Everyone!

The first meeting of the as of yet unnamed North Carolina bus club was a success! In breif about 10 buses from 1961 to 1984 arrived at First Cariolina Deli, took over a huge section of the dining area and had a great time getting to know each other. After lunch we drove down the street to Viking Flooring for the business portion of the meeting and tore down a 1800cc to figure out what the po had done to kill it. 

It is now time to get the Triange Chapter going. Our first meeting will be on Saturday March 3rd (sorry but something came up and the 24th won't work for me :)at 11:30 in Hillsborough, NC (just outisde of Chapel Hill.) The meeting place will be Allen and Sons BBQ on HWY 86. I will post directions on the website. This will be an informal icebreaker meeting but we will be discussing the details of our June campout and picnic at Jordan Lake. 

The bus club is open to all air and water cooled transporters and there are no fee to join. If you have a 67 or earlier bus or just want to join we will be attempting to form an additional chapter of NEATO (if NEATO will have us :)Details about NEATO are available at http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~deasterw/neato.html
