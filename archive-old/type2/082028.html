Subject: [T2] Orientation of bolt-on gear on camshaft.

&gt;Can anyone offer guidance on how to orient the bolt-on gear (threee-holes)
&gt;onto the camshaft?
&gt;
&gt;I think it should be the timing dot (on one of the teeth of the gear)
&gt;aligned with the slot on the end of the camshaft where the gear connects?

Correct. The bolt with the dot goes to the end of the slot.
