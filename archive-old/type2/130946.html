Subject: Re: [T2] Hidden Danger in Low Mileage Tires

My 79 had a nice set of low mileage Continentals when I bought it in 96.  
Soon after, those tires took us from the SF Bay area to the Grand Canyon and 
back.  Later that summer, the right rear blew while driving along HWY 24 in 
Lafayette at about 65 mph (big boom, lots of rear end sway, smoke, 
etc,etc,etc).  Pulled off to the side of the freeway, got out and saw that 
the right rear tire was shredded.  The tread had seperated most of the way 
around the tire and &quot;roto-peened&quot; my wheel well; lots of damage.  Had to 
change the tire on a hill, in the dark, on the side of the freeway at 5:45 
AM.  I even made the morning traffic report &quot;...and look out for the guy on 
the side of the freeway changing the tire on a Volkswagen van...&quot;

I now have newer Michelins all around...but even these are getting a few 
years old (still with low miles though).
