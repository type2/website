First, this is not me selling the bus.  I saw this bus in the recycler www.recycler_dot_com
and went to look at it. You can see a picture online if you search recycler_dot_com

'73 Orange Westy in overall nice shape. Westy interior with sink, stool, bed, closet, etc.
Aluminum Buick v8
Porsche 5 speed
Equipped for Towing 

Front seats need re-upholstering. Pop-top has been removed, so you have a permanent
3 foot sunroof. The owner has the poptop, but not the canvas so it could be re-attached.

The wheel wells have been cut but have been done very professionally. 15 inch wheels
and tires are installed.

Coil-over shocks are mounted on all four wheels and provide additional lift. I did not
notice any evidence of cracking around the mounts.

Second gear works intermittently when double-clutched. I think maybe the transmission
should be replaced. The brakes pull to one side and make screeching noises but seem
to stop well.

I did not notice any rust except a small amount (barely noticeable) on the bottom of
the windshield. The owner says that there are a few rust areas on the doors and one
on the right rear side that have been leaded (as opposed to bondo'd). These areas are
primered over, but appear to have been done well.

Overall, the conversion appears to me to have been done very professionally.  If I had
more time and the inclination to mess with putting in a used 911 transmission I would pick
it up myself.  Even now I feel the temptation, but I am exercising discipline. I've heard
that once you get a second bus they tend to multiply, so maybe I'm best off staying
with one ;-)

The guy who is selling it is named Tony.  His number is (818)765-8598. I told him I would
mention it to a friend if I decided I'm not buying it, so I guess I'm telling more than
one friend. ;-)
