Subject: NJ-DC-going early Fri to NC campout?
Message-Id: &lt;199904091823.OAA13414_at_mime3.prodigy_dot_com&gt;

Unless it's pouring for 3 days, I'm heading out between 10-11AM on Fri the
16th for the campout in NC- going down 95 to 85 West, celebrating the 3rd
time around the clock (over 200K ON ORIGINAL ENGINE).
anyone else going earlyish that may want to caravan?  If not, then you DC
guys leaving around 6 look out for a beige 78 Westy with the big Green
&quot;mailbox&quot; on top in case it gives up the ghost!
