Subject: Por-15 &amp; High Temp Por-15


Hi, I've been reading all the 'rust' posts &amp; I've used por-15 on both my
beetle &amp; bus with great results.  It is pretty costly, but well worth it.
As for the high temp por-15, that didn't work very good for me.  My muffler
started rusting after less than a year.

Hope this helps,
Keri
