Subject: Gas Heaters

I am thinking about buying a new Espar B1LC gas heater for my bus.  I was
given the following pricing information:

B1LC Heater	$1320.00
Installation kit	$420.50
Switch		$65.35
Pickup tube	$37.35

Total		$1843.2

This seems like a LOT of money.  Is there anyone out there that can give
advice?  Do I need this installation kit?  Pickup tube?  What do I really
NEED to get this heater working in my '72 bus?

Thanks,
