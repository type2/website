Subject: Lookin into 77/78 Campers

If anyone has any information that might help me make up my mind between a
77 or 78 camper bus,  I would really appreciate it.  I have never owned one
of my own, but have worked on a couple of earlier models.  I realize there
are some engine differences, but if anyone was worked/owned these models
and has some words of wisdom, it would great.  I do quite a bit of camping
and treking  in Oregon and California, so the camper seems the logical
choice.

thanks for the help

peace
