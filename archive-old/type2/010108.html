On 7/10/99 5:23 AM, hineline_at_helix.ucsd_dot_edu thus spake:

&gt;You have the chance of a lifetime! Please, don't waste it. Bundle up the 
&gt;kids and the SO and put them in your bus and head out. Use your bus every 
&gt;chance you get, and steal a chance or too to boot.
&gt;
&gt;In no time at all, the kids will be six-foot-two.

Amen. 

Mom got a '78 Westy brand spanking new off the showroom floor, she, my 
sister, and I spent many a wonderful weekend together in it. Mostly down 
around Anza Borrego Desert, but occasionally got some forest camping in 
too. Some of the happiest times I had as a kid, going on the ranger 
guided nature walks. Damn near stepped on a rattler one time. ;-)

Fast forward to now, and I'm driving a '78 Westy too. Looking forward to 
passing the experience on to Hunter, now that we're back in California 
and have access to these places I so fondly remember.



Peace,
