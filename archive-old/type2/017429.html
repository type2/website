Jay,

I do have a suggestion, its not pretty but it should work.  Most of your home
build it places carry small sheets of thin aluminum or rolls of the same.  You
could cut a piece so that it fits in the hole left by the a/c compressor,
overlapping into the existing tin about 1/2 inch for fastening purposes.  Drill
some holes every 2 inches or so along the perimeter of the patch. Using a cheap
pop rivit gun, the entire patch could be held in place with pop rivits.
Line up the patch and drill one hole into the existing tin, insert rivit and
fasten.  Move to a hole on the opposite side and drill the tin.  Repeat with
rivit.  You could do this for all the holes and not have a problem with any of
them lining up.  It won't win you any show points but it's inexpensive and will
work.

Scott
