I replaced my 77 bus front axle with a 72, one piston on the 72 caliper is
stuck. I assumed that I could take the one off the 77 and put it on the 72
axle, but when I have them both on the bench they look different. The older
one has only one grease nozzle (other has two) and the piston seems smaller.
Can I interchange these two?
Thanks!
eric
