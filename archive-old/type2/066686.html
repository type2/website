Subject: Need a 1600 Bus case

Howdy all. In my quest to make Joel's old crew cab a daily driver, I find
myself replacing the engine case, as the old one has one of the holes for the
cylinder/head studs all stripped out. Anyway, The best price I've found is $400
for a new case, and $100 for a 40 over case. So, I figure that someone out
there has a much better price on a new case, or at least one that can be bored
to 20 over. Bear in mind that this is the 1600 Type I case, with special holes
in the rear of the case to allow the engine brace to bolt on. AS-21 universal
cases also have this feature. Anyway, if anyone can help me, I'd certainly
appreciate any leads...
Thanks,
