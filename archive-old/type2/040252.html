Check the crosspipe between the two carbs and the boots that connect the 
brake booster pipe to the manifolds.  Those are the most likely places that 
you could have a sudden vacuum leak that large.  Oh wait, one other 
possibility.  On the front of the left carb there is a hole that is plugged 
with a thin metal disc.  If the disc pops out, you will have the hissing 
and vacuum leak since this is near where the manifold crossover pipe 
connects to the central idling system output.  You can't see this one as 
the carb is very near the firewall, but I was able to find the leak by 
feeling behind the carb with my fingers and listening.  I epoxied the 
little metal disc back in (found it on top of the tin) and haven't had a 
problem since.
