Subject: campmobile water tank replacement/resto....

I have a '69 Westy with the non-draining sink/hand pump water
reservoir made by campmobile.

The &quot;fill tube&quot; on the water reservoir (the tank located behind the
ice-box)is broken and cap is missing. Anyone have a complete tank for
sale or should I do a &quot;home-style-fixit&quot;?
