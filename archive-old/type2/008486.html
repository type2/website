Volks,

Just wanted to say bye.

I've already unsubscribed from vintagebus and I'm going to sign off 
Type2 for a while.

My leaving is not a reflection off the state of the lists. Both 
list's are a great resource but I find that I delete most posts 
and haven't been able, or willing, to take the time to contribute 
much, not that I did much anyway.

Another reason is that I find I'm using and working on my bus less 
and less. Motorcycling has stolen a lot of my time and the bus sits 
waiting for the time that I see fit the start her up to run an errand 
or do a chore, like moving the kids furniture.

I have really valued the list's contribution (in it's varying 
forms) to my life over the last few years. The 'list' certainly 
changed my view of the people who live in the biggest English 
speaking country (and you other guys from different continents too). 

I look forward to travelling to North America sometime and hopefully 
I will be able to make contact with a few listees then. But that's a 
while away yet.

Sorry for taking up bandwidth I didn't want to just disappear into 
the ether without saying thanks.

Regards,


Ian
