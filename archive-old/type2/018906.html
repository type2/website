Howdy, y'all!

The Genealogy Tour '99 officially begins tonight -- as soon as I clock
outta here! It's also Wendelin's maiden voyage, so I'm more than a
little bit nervous....

I'm really looking forward to meeting anyone on The List who might be on
my route. I've already got a few offers for campsites and beverages.
Can't wait! :-)

I'll be heading through El Paso, Snyder, Weatherford (by next weekend),
then around through Dallas, Austin, San Antonio, and back through El
Paso.

I'll be checking my e-mail every coupla days, so I'll be in touch.

Wish me luck! I *think* I remembered everything....

Nikki
