&gt; I had the torsion bar adjusted on my '74 Bay to raise the saggy rear end.  So

&gt; I understand the recent adjustment was made to both the inner and outer

&gt; that the spring plate does not knock against the stopper?


take about half the adjustment back out, one spline, either one inner or
outer but the same both sides
