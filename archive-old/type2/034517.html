Subject: rebuilt 1700 head

i have a rebuilt 1700 cc head in great shape that im
looking to sell.  i needed(still need) an 1800 head
and was sent this as a 1800 which it wasnt.  i cant
get ahold of the individual for a refund so im looking
to sell it.   i would just like to get out what i put
in(or trade for a 1800) which was $95 and that would
include all shipping charges.  it is in great shape
and ready to install and go.  and if you have an 1800
head in good shape let me know.  thanks
