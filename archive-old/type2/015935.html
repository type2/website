&gt;&gt;If these are the things you need, you do not want a Volkswagen Bus.
&gt;
&gt;Completely agree with Shawn.  If you want modern conveniences, buy
something modern (i.e., Winnebago camper or decent FWD minivan).  

Or get an 86 or later Westy and take really good care of it (change the oil
regularly, use the special coolant, etc).  Some of the late Vanagons have
nice alloy wheels, power windows, A/C, heat, and manage to retain at least
a little VW heritage (hey, it's made in Germany and is rear-engine,
right?).  Just don't think you're gonna tow an 18 ft boat behind it.  One
problem with this is that these late-Vanagon Westies are relatively rare
and expensive.  I can't remember the last time I saw a Westy like Steve
Johnson's '91.
