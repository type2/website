Subject: Re: cool and fragrant

&gt;&gt;a friend recommended placing a homemade .005 paper shim between the crank
&gt;&gt;and the flywheel, and make up the difference with the three metal shims.
&gt;&gt;this is due to the slag humps up on the front end of the crank.
&gt;
&gt;Wouldn't the paper dissolve with the oil and heat? At least get squeezed out?

* great point chris. only thing i can think of is the suggestion came from
someone not familiar with the T IV reinstall, and may have felt thats how T
I flywheels go back. i dun't really know.

&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;flywheel has equal divits - as if metal was pulled away from the flywheel
&gt;&gt;in some kinda stuck-then-separated metal mess fusion. i wish i'd noticed
&gt;&gt;that while the crank was out. any thoughts on this effort? can we get a
&gt;&gt;judgement on this?  i tried chunking the slag off with a putty knife to no
&gt;&gt;avail. i'm apprehensive about taking a grinding tool to it, but can be
&gt;&gt;persuaded if that's the correct route to take. chisel? all notions deeply,
&gt;&gt;truly, madly appreciated.  - steve
&gt;
&gt;File them down. A good file, slightly oiled, works wonders quickly. File on
&gt;one motion (away from you) only as dragging it on the metal as you pull it
&gt;back will only dull it.
&gt;
&gt;I would strongly advise you to visit a machine shop and see what they
&gt;think. Almost sounds like flywheel damage b/c it was not tight and came
&gt;off. Did this happen while in your care?

not completely sure what you mean with regard to not tight. seems to me
they were fused together by heat and had to be separated b/c of the way the
divits match up with the raised portions...

getting a file in there is going to be impossible. crank is set back
(already installed in the case) THANKS!
