Maybe he just plays a doctor on TV. As far as a straight points
replacement ie pertronix the unit costs about 50.00 and is warranteed to
work for 18 months i figured before that the cost of tune up parts in an
equivalent time for me driving 250-300 miles a week was about the same.
the big difference is no point swapping or dwell adjustments for that 18
months. If points were so good they would still be using them. 

in response to folks writing thusly::

&gt; &gt;&gt;I want to replace my *ordinary* ignition with an electronic one...

&gt; I think the good dokter...has a real good point...maybe you missed it.......
&gt; &gt;Let's see. How many sets of points can we get for $300????????????
&gt; Stock system..in good tune...no need to change....
&gt; I dunno..you do the math....
&gt; how many points/ign parts can u buy for $300 +  dollars..
&gt; 

well i did the math and CDI etc is not equivalent to points replacement.
