&gt; I looked in www.four11_dot_com for the last name in her town in NJ and found
&gt; nothing :-( This may be the sort of thing that you would be better at than
&gt; any of the rest of us.  If you do get contact information, let Charlie and
&gt; I know!

My heart goes out to Kristin's family. And my prayers. 

One interesting bit of news: In October of last year, the state of
Arkansas finished installing video surveillance cameras in all of its
rest areas, after the 1997 murder of trucker Arthur Joe Cotton in that
same Morrilton rest area. 

More clues = better chance of solving the case.
