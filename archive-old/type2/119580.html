Subject: Re: [T2] Reattaching oil pickup in a 1600cc engine

Hello Guys   It can be done but you will have to bend the pickup plate some 
to be able to get in there , run the stud in then attach the nut to a box end 
wrench using dum-dum or 3 m wheatherstip glue after tightening re bend the 
plate back in to shape.I would also use locktite and a lock washer here.  Not the 
prettiest way but way better than tearing the motor down.   later and have fun
