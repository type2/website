Subject: Oil FART...

Listees;
   I sent this to ZR72 re: the oil FART. He/She asked that I forward it
to you.
tada!

   FWIW re: the oil thing. I've used Valvoline in my VW's for 25 years.
30W
most
of the time, 40W in the summer (Texas heat). I usually use the &quot;racing
motor&quot;
type because of, yeah, heat.
   On another note, an experiment is underway on a 1994 Jeep Cherokee
bought new
for my wife in 94. After a break in period (about 500 miles on the
&quot;factory&quot;
oil), I started using Valvoline synthetic. Sometime when the synthetic
is
unavailable, I've used the semi synthetic. We are now at 127,000 miles
and
counting. The compression is right where it was 125,000 miles ago.
Nothing
has
ever failed on this engine (except fot a heater hose). It performs as
strong as
it did the day we bought it. I've peeked through the oil filler and the
valve
train is clean, no gunk. No gunk at oil change time either.
   Oil changes on all my vehicles are at 3-4,000 mile intervals, new
Fram
filters
(where applicable).
   I've never had a lubrication related engine failure.
   Mark me down as a Valvoline fan.
