&gt; Hello Eddie   First you will need the adapter that turns the oil filler 
&gt; hole 
&gt; into a dipstick hole  empi, bugpack  CB, scat make these   I have all the 
&gt; other stuff you need where are you located  I am in vIRGINIA   You can use 
&gt; the 
&gt; type 3 oil cooler which is a little better than thetype 1  also doing that 
&gt; will 
&gt; give you an oil switch otherwise you will have to drill and tap the case for 
&gt; 
&gt; one or you will have to cut a slot for the oil switch to show thur the fan 
&gt; housing. . The other difference is the oil cooler stud but that isnt a 
&gt; problem   
&gt; later and have fun  Mark Dearing

Hey guys    Hey guys  looks like nobody reads my posts huh??   the next 4 
answers to this post just repeatsed what I just said didnt they but without tell 
how   But the point is if it is going into a 72 and later  it will fit right 
in you will just have to solve the carb problem  might be cheaper to buy a 
progessive weber kit for the type 3 than all the type 1 stuff.  Later  Mark
