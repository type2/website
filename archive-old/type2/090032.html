&gt; Volks,
&gt; Just searched the archives and could not find the answer i'm looking for.
&gt; The disc brakes have 2 bleeder valves. Do i bleed them both? just the top?
&gt; the top first?

Just the top.

&gt; Aslo, the sears vaccuum hand pump i bought says i should start with the
&gt; bleeder valve closest to the master cyl (left front), but the idiot book
&gt; says start with the one furthest from the master cyl (Right Rear). Which is
&gt; correct?

Interesting problem.  Since the idiot book is written for folks bleeding
their system via pressure you might want to follow the instrucitons for
the vacuum pump.  As long as the brakes are firm when you are done the
order does not matter.
