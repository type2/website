Jon, I had the same problem in my 72 bus.  Ended up replacing the entire fuel 
line and fuel system.  That cleared up the smells and the gas leak.

Good luck,
Rob :-)

I have a 72 bus which is in pretty mint condition.  One problem is I smell 
gas fumes inside the bus.  I'm pretty sure its my gas tank or the over flow 
tank because I smell it the worst on a full tank.  How can I fix this?  I'm 
pretty sure its not the exhaust eventhough the fumes come out of the heater 
vents.   Thank You
