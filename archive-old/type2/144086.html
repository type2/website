 Since I had the nose of the 78 replaced my signal

Take a look at the gap between the steering wheel and
the lower cover. If it is more than a 1/4&quot;, then
neither the horn nor cancelling will work.

You need to loosen the bolt in the hole on the bottom
left as you are looking at the housing from the
drivers seat. This is easier said than done. The
original bolt was a shear bolt. By that I mean the
head is designed to shear off once you tighten it.
This is to prevent theft, because the bolt holds the
steering lock to the column. You need to remove the
bolt and then replace it with a Allen head bolt. Raise
the housing up to the steering wheel and then tighten it.
