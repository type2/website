&gt; Hey Gang,
&gt; 
&gt; I've been planning a 3 month trip to Mexico and I'm worried about
the stock
&gt; propane tank under my 79 Westy.  There is only about 8 inches of
clearance
&gt; between the skid plate and terra firma and I'm afraid one of Mexico's
&gt; notorious topes (speed bumps) or a huge pot hole will sneak up me
and cause
&gt; a catastrophy.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone have any first-hand experience involving close encounters
&gt; between stock propane tanks and bad roads?
&gt; 
&gt; I have considered replacing the under-vehicle tank with a 1 gallon
&gt; inside-vehicle tank.  If I decide to do this, I would vent the
relief valve
&gt; out the bottom of the vehicle with a hose and seal the storage place
so that
&gt; it's air-tight.  But it still makes me nervous and I don't want to
do it
&gt; unless it's really necessary.

People seem to have the impression that Mexican roads are horrible! 
In reality Mexicans drive ordinary cars just like
Norte-Norteamericanos, so their roads are certainly navigable.  The 8
inches of clearance below your propane tank is a lot more than most
modern cars, so I would not expect clearance problems unless you get
_way_ off of the beaten path.  Mexican topes (and bordos) are
certainly attention-getters, but they are seldom more than 3 inches
tall.  Sometimes the locals will remove a couple of the topes to allow
their wheels to zip through the gaps without hitting the bump, which
is quite fun if your car is the correct width.

Unless you are going to do some serious rock crawling, I'd suggest
that you leave your propane tank alone.  It's a lot of work to
relocate properly.
