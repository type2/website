Subject: Re: (long)[T2] AFM adjustment of spring tension-how?

George,

I have two megasquirts that I have been working on, one for my
78 bus and one for a bug later on.

If you have ever done soldering on a printed circuit board before, maybe 3 
hours assembly time.  Add another  hour for potential trouble-shooting.

You get to lose the AFM and the original ECU.  You can either lose
or keep the resistor pack and double relay, depending on what you 
want to do.  You add an o2 sensor if you want, add a Throttle position
sensor if you are after total power.  You add a intake air temp sensor, 
but can use your original head temp sensor for warmup enrichment.

Making a wiring harness and actually putting it on the car might take a
weekend, depending on how you plan it out and think ahead.

Count on a couple of hours to a couple of days to tune it, unless you use 
Mike or Ed's tuning parameters that are already set up(you need a laptop).

I spent close to 4 hours troubleshooting my original FI system from
never having seen one or read the bentley till the night before.

I have buddies that have spent entire weekends striping out FI and adding
carb$$$$.  If you already have fi, it is a very viable alternative, 
especially if you have ever done even the most minimal of electronics 
assembly.

For me, the real benefit is I get to buy the cam for my engine that
says &quot;not recomended for stock fi&quot;....and the whole system costs **far**
less than the equivalent from CB or some of the other suppliers.

I will be doing it on my bus after labor day weekend and no, it is 
probably not for everyone.

Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt; &quot;Instead of dealing with all of this ancient fuel injection, I got a
&gt; &gt; megasquirt EFI.  Cost me about $120, less than a rebuilt AFM, and I can
&gt; &gt; tune my entire EFI with a laptop.  It blows the l-jet out of the water
&gt; &gt; and is a breeze to tune compared to the l-jet's &quot;spring tuning.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Ummm, cost was low, but how many man-hours went into building the unit and
&gt; interfacing it to the bus?  The megasquirt is interesting, but it seems to
&gt; be just about a hobby unto itself.  It isn't exactly a Heathkit!
