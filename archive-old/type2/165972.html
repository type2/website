Subject: RE: [T2] Advice on Bus Purchase?

Rust is the real bugaboo on these things...inspect the
windshield frame (lower) and all whell wells and lower
body panels.  Also lookunder the poptop.  ANY
significant rust means the vehicle is worth probably
less than $1000.

40,000 miles is getting up there for a bus
engine...the heads are probably near (or beyond) the
end of their life, and depending on use the cyclinders
might be done at around 60,000. A mechanical
inspection with a compression check is a must here. A
rebuilt engine is probably in the future: $1500+
(install it yourself) or $3000+ (shop install).

CV boots are cheap and easy, as are wheel bearings,
shocks, and brake calipers.  You could do all that
yourself for a  $200 or so.  CV joints are also easy,
but more expensive...another $200.

If it has all the original camper parts that is a
bonus. Also good if the eberspracher heater
works...VERY hard to get parts for these. 

Definately use the check list from the archives...and
expect disappointment. It's hard to find a decent bus
unless it's been restored.
