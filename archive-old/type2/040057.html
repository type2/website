Subject: screen

we have replaced that whole panel in our old bus.  Its a bitch though cuz 
you have to pull the whole thing out.

I'd suggest if you know someone who can sew pretty good to get them to do 
it.  You can seam rip the old screen out.  Buy new screen(not the aluminum 
kind) and pin it in place of the old.  Handstitch it back in.  That is 
probably the easiest cuz pulling out that whole pop top canvas is really 
really not fun.

i'd be willing to do it for ya, but not sure where you live.
