Subject: VW Trends

    I decided to give Trends a try when I got a &quot;deal&quot; on a subscription at 
the Real Source Funfest.
    I have now let my subscription run out due to the same things everyone 
else has already mentioned. 
     Wonder how many subscribers they will lose before they &quot;shake up&quot; the 
editing department.
