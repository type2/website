&gt; no. light of any kind, no fuel pump noise&lt;&lt;

See if you have parking lights or dome light, if you
DO have parking lights or dome lights, then my guess
is that the wire coming from the ignition switch to
the fuse box (probably the first or second fuse from
the right of the fuse box, possible fat red wire??)
has shorted out against the bus body or another metal
something. Although, I would guess that this would
blow that fuse, so double check and replace the fuse
even if it deosn't &quot;look&quot; blown. This wire also could
have come off of the fuse terminal or burnt thru the
sheath and is still shorting out against something
metal. 
 Get out your volt meter, and test all fuse terminals
with the ignition switch OFF. At least ONE of these
terminals should be &quot;live&quot; (12 volt or there-abouts
reading)with the key off.  If not, then you have
shorted something out between the fuse box and the
battery\voltage regulator.
 Assuming you have power at at least one of the
terminals with key &quot;off&quot;, try and turn the ignition
switch &quot;on&quot; and re-test all fuse terminals.  There
should be a few more &quot;live&quot; terminals in this
scenario.  If not, then your problem lies between the
ignition switch and the fuse block (which would be my
bet) in which case go back the first paragraph in this
reply. If you find nothing there, you may have fried
your ignition switch.
