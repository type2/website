Subject: High oil temps

As some of you may remember, I have been trying to find the cause of my
high oil temps.  On a 90+ degree day, my oil temps running at 65mph on the
Interstate would eventually climb to 250-255F. Slowing down did not result
in cooler temps. Now that the temps here in Alabama are in the low 80's
(or cooler), I expected my oil temps to drop. Nope. Still high, even
though it takes 20 or more minutes of driving for it to get there. I
checked everything, timing, engine seals, vacuum leaks, etc.  Well, I
believe I have found the cause....so simple.

About a year ago, I removed my failing heater fan and installed bilge
blower fans in it's place. What is missing in this picture are the flaps
that are built into the stock fan. What I believe was happening was the
engine fan was sucking hot air from the heat exchangers and using that hot
air to &quot;cool&quot; my engine due to the lack of any kind of flaps to restrict
flow in that direction. Notice I said &quot;was&quot;. I took some aluminum soda
cans, cut them in half and used those to block off the openings until I
can figure out a one-way valve configuration.

Saturday, drove to Huntsville..about a 2.5 hr drive. A high of 81F at
65mph, my oil temps were about 255F.

Sunday, I blocked heater openings and drove back to Tuscaloosa. A high of
78F at 70mph, oil temps were 220F.

I wish I had thought about this earlier. A 35F degree temp drop, just
plugging the heater outputs in the engine compartment. If you dont have
any flaps on your heaters, I'd get some!

So, on that note, any ideas on a one-way air valve?

I found this one so far, dont know if it will work or not.
