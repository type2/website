    Hi All...

Awhile back I posted about the high price of door seals for my '70 Westy.
My FLAPS wanted CAN$600.00 for all five.  After posting I received a few
replies for alternatives.  A fellow listee recommended California Imports,
and suggested that I talk to 'Tim'.  My new seals arrived the exact day Tim
said they would (one week from the time of the call), and at a cost about
$250.00 less than my original quote.  There is nothing like good customer
service, good prices and punctuality...Thank you Mr.Kratch, and thank you
California Imports...looks like Caroline will make the show this weekend
after all...


Also, my two cents on the BPRS..count me in..I would be glad to help out any
listee in any way I can...
As the saying goes...'what comes around, goes around'...I hope that I never
have to call anyone for assistance, but to know that it is there if I need
it is very comforting.

I hope to meet some listees this coming weekend (June 20) at the June
Jitterbug, http://www.johnsbugshop_dot_com/page24.html , it was a great turn out
last year...

The event is located in Niagara Falls, Ontario...about 25 minutes from
Buffalo, New York.   more info at the above link.  If your are coming let me
know so I can be on the look out...I'll be there with Caroline (Red
Westy)...

Take Care..
