Howzabout replacing the generator/alternator pulley with a smaller one?

&gt; And the reverse for the larger pulley.
&gt;
&gt; Seems like Berg said they tried several different pulley sizes and the
&gt; stock size worked best. Least power, best cooling, etc.
&gt;
&gt; I think he was saying that due to the increased power requirements of =
the
&gt; pulley, the engine made as much more heat as the faster fan carried =
away.
&gt; No advantage.

I think that Berg was right for the wrong reasons.  Above a certain RPM =
I
think that the flow through the cylinders and cooler is choked and will
not increase no matter how much faster you spin the fan.  I also wonder
how you get a larger crank pulley into the pulley tin.
