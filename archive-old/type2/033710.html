&gt;Wow. That was a speedy reply.

I was just thinking the same thing.  Especially since it's 03:00 where you
are, right?

&gt;&gt; First things first - how is the compression?
&gt;
&gt;Hmm.. I don't know, and I don't have a compression tester. Any way to
&gt;'guess' around?

When you crank the engine before it starts, do all of the &quot;pulses&quot; sound
even?  Or does it go ra-ra-RA-ra-ra-ra-RA-ra-ra-ra-RA...  Pulses should all
be the same, if not, it indicates one or more weak cylinders.

When the engine is running, you can pull each spark plug wire from the
distributor cap in turn and note the RPM drop.  The RPM drop should be
nearly the same for all cylinders.  No or only slight RPM drop indicates
(very) low compression in a cylinder, if everything else (spark, fuel) is
working properly.

But really you should try and obtain a compression tester so there will be
no uncertainty.  Here they only cost about US$30 - a worthwhile investment.

Do you have hydraulic lifters?  If not, have you checked your valve clearances?
