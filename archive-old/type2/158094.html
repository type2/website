Subject: VW will not shut off....

This is not bus related, but it is VW related. I am hoping that someone on the
list can help me out here.

I have a friend that has a bug that will start fine, but when he turns the key
off, it will not shut off. I think it is a 79 fuel injected model. I have my
bus Bentley for him to look at, but I am not sure if they will help. For a FI
model, it looks like the coil is what is used to kill the engine and that it
controlled by the computer or double relay. Can anyone on this list help me
help him?

You can PM me off the list since it is not a bus related question.

Thanks,
Corbett
