Subject: bus add

This is a bus add from a Delaware area free paper.  I thought it was of
interest so I am passing it on.  

1970 VW Bus 6 cyl Chevy Corvair eng. 110 gp.  Needs some work.  32k
orig. miles.  Has not been tagged since 1974. $1000 OBO.  after 6 pm
1-410-939-9470

Also I meet a retired man who had been also a VW mechanic who did a very
nice job restoring his 1974 nine passenger wagon.  Maybe I can get
pictures.  Anyway he is looking for a 3/4 roof rack.  I know these have
been mentioned on the list before but does anyone have any leads now?
