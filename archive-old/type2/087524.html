Subject: The hole in the catalytic converter

Dear Folks,

	Thank you for the help! The hole in the converter is by design. I
have no need for it so it's getting plugged.

	The timing problem got worked out. I was babying the distributor.
I'm glad it was my fault and nothing mechanical $$$. I didn't turn the
distributor clockwise far enough to bring the count from 28 BTDC to 7 BTDC.
I failed to loosen the collar all the way.

	The CO adjust screw. I'll keep it turned all the way in, (rich) as
suggested. I guess I'll hafta take it to someone's shop for the exhaust gas
analyzer test to get the correct output and to master the smog test. Can
anyone in the audience suggest a shop in the Seattle area?

	NEXT...the ticking noise. The archives will come in handy on this task.

					Thanks again,

					Craig
