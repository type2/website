Subject: reman halfshafts and longevity

I used to use remanufactured halfshafts in my 1988 Golf.  They would last
about 40,000 miles (&quot;lifetime warranty&quot;).  Granted, I had some other play in
my front end that may have contributed to their demise.  When I finally
totaled the car it had 286,000 miles on it and running like a top.  thats a
lot of halfshafts.

These days for the bus, I would probably get the new ones, because of the
vendor specials, or else in a pinch just use a used shaft from a junkyard,
and carry a spare.

Right now I carry a junkyard spare because who knows how long my bus shafts
have been on there.  Repack them every few years.
