Subject: Re: [T2] Oberg



&gt; &gt; AFAIK, Oberg makes a filter, not a cooler.  A good cooler comes from
&gt; &gt; Harrison. A good source for all racecar oiling system parts is Earl's
&gt; &gt; Supply.


The large Oberg filter is finned aluminum, and is very good at cooling your 
oil.  It also has the option of a &quot;telltale light&quot; that mounts on your dash, 
and tells you when the reuseable element needs cleaning.  Very nicely 
constructed filter.

	Eron
