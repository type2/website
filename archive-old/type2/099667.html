Subject: Re: [T2] Rear Window for a 1978 Bus

&gt;Anyone have the rear window for a 1978 VW bus?
&gt;
&gt;Someone threw a rock through mine just one night before it was to be 
&gt;tended to by the moving company.

ANY glass shop (commerical) can cut you a new window and get it tempered 
for you for little money. You'll need the dimensions of course - maybe the 
list can provide them to you. It won't have the defroster though.
