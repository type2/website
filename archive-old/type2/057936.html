Hello All,

I am struggling with a fundamental theory, is ATDC to the left or the right
of TDC with the engine at idle and a strobe illuminating the scene?

               |                                       |
               5                   or                  5
         TDC       10                             10       TDC

Which is after and which is before?  If the crank turns clockwise I say the
first is before.  My 71 is timed the first way and I hope that is not wrong
it should be ATDC...

I read Sean, Mike, and Jim's great articles in the library but nobody
seemed to talk about it.

Thanks,

--Brian Allen
