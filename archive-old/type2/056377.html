Milan Michigan show is a all VW show and drags...the drags kinda stink,.. in
that it raises the show fees to like 12$ for all spectators.....plus extra
for show car entry!!!   I have been going to this show for 10+ years...it has
been killer in the past but seems to have thinned out over the past couple
years....mainly because of this yearly entrance fee increase. I wonder will
these greedy drag show promoters ever realize they are shooting themeselves
in the foot before its too late???

Anyways the show is enjoyable, as are all of the VW friends there....the
infamous Vintage VW club of Michigan is in charge of the show (the are known
for the VWOA show every May in Detroit VWOA Headquarters)  The swap is good
sized and usually the buggy dudes in Michigan give away steals on old Vintage
parts they know or care nothing about....so all in all, despite the costly
entrance fee, it is worth going to me.

There is free primative camping in the fields across from the show the night
before, it is usually a pretty good party.  But don't expect to get much
sleep!!!

Here is some directions and info:

Info: Contact Rathburn Enterprises (517) 436-6297
Location of Milan Dragway site of show:
&gt;From I-94, take US 23 South to Milan Michigan the Plank Road exit, Take Plank
Road 6 miles east to dragway

tent and safaris..._dot_come up and say hello.
