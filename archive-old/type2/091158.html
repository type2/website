Subject: Need a mechanic

I am having mechanical problems with my  78 westphalia camper van and am
looking for a good mechanic in the East Haddam area of Connecticut . It
seems every person who once worked on these vehicals no longer does or
has any  idea of  where to go for help. If you could post this message
it would be greatly  appreciated.
