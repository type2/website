Dear Richard et al

Why not consider Hella H4s or Cibie H4s as
alternatives. These are both good quality European
manufacturers.

Either these or the Bosch units, might be available
from Daniel Stern Lighting

URL   http://lighting.mbz_dot_org/

There are also some iteresting 7 inch, combined H4
headlamp units, H3 auxiliary driving lights and
turn-signal (or daytime running light) at 

URL   http://brazilshopping_dot_com

Regards.

        Nigel A. Skeet

 I having a tough time finding Bosch H4's. I found
&lt;www.fastforward_dot_ca&gt; 
but they have the 7&quot; headlights with the parking light
inside. Bosch doesn't seem to have a lighting section
on their website either.

Does anyone know a good dealer for this item?
