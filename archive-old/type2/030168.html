Make sure that the engine of the car that is doing the jumping is _off_.
You don't want to play &quot;dueling voltage regulators&quot;!

I really prefer to jump with the good battery disconnected from the
&quot;jumper's&quot; vehicle's electrical system.  You can't hurt what isn't
connected.

&gt; Hi All,
&gt; Is there something special I should know about jumping a fuel injected bus?  
&gt; Just incase I need to jump it, I don't want to over load anything.
&gt; Thanks
