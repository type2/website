&gt; Well, I have a 78 and an IQ of ... and from memory, the routine for #2 plug

a somewhat simpler method that I have used with my 78 for years is.

. remove plug wire.
. get plug socket with top also hexed
. reach in and push socket into hole and over plug (just socket no
extension or ratchet
. take small (1/4 in) ratchet with socket to fit over outside of plug
socket, no extension, should just reach
. ratchet out plug socket until loose
. reach in with fingers and lift out plug and socket together 
 (the plug and socket together is large enough that if you drop it it will
not fall down into the tin where you can't reach it, plenty of experience
there)
. to replace is pretty much the reverse.  

I get a small stool and sit in the rear of the car. big arms or fat
fingered persons get kid to do it for you.  when finished make sure no
hoses or wires have been knocked loose.  contortionist system but at least
nothing has to be taken off and after practice I can do it in far less
time.

&gt; You have to REMOVE the air cleaner/air sensor to reach the plug.   This
&gt; involves (1) loosening the phillips screw to the hose clamp left of the
&gt; silver box with the black top which is the air sensor. (2) pull off the
Snip 
&gt; comes the fun of feeling on that plug wire end!
