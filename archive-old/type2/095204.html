Subject: Re: [T2] idling problem



I would suggest you check the idle-cutoff solenoid for tightnes, and make 
sure the plug in the front of the carburaetor's body is still intact. I have 
had a few blown out via backfires, and been unaware of this fact because of 
my one-piece throttle-position sensor.

  It just
&gt; &gt; cuts off, I can keep the bus running by giving it gas .  What do I need 
&gt;to
&gt; &gt; do.  I've been working like mad to get this ready for our trip to Canada
&gt; &gt; and I'm just fried. Advice needed!
