Subject: no title for my bus

When I bought my camper , it was from some Antique auto dealer and all I got 
was a bill of sale and no title. He said it wouldn't be a problem. Is there 
any reason why I would have a problem (like registering it when I get it all 
fixed up) Why is the title important???


Thanks for the info!
Dave
