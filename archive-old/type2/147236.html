Don,

Is the parking brake released?  ;-) You've probably already tried to 
roll the van to be sure the brake shoes aren't rusted to the drums.
I'd suspect the plug wires. Since you've swapped them around already 
with no joy, possibly the coil to cap wire is bad or all of them are 
bad, not unlikely since they're all the same age...
What led up to this? Was it gradual or a sudden onset?
