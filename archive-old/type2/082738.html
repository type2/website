Subject: Re: [T2] Cleaning West roof


X-14 is really wonderful stuff.  It neatly killed all the mildew on
the tile and grout in my bath tub.  However the label does include a
warning that it reacts badly with metal.  I verified this, the ring
around the drain in the tub is now rusty.  So keep that in mind.
But it should really do the trick for your mildewy poptop.

&gt; found that X-14 bleach base bathroom cleaner works real well for
&gt; restoring old fiberglass poptop.  Put on some clothes that you can use
&gt; for rags later, they will get bleached out.  Get the roof wet, spray
&gt; on the X-14 let it sit for about 15 min and spray off.  Re-apply and
&gt; scrub like hell on the bad spots.  This is a nice quick way to make a
&gt; grungy pop-top look white again.
