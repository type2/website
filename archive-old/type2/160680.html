Subject: Re: VW Wheel Balance Adapter - $50

Hello again.

I caught this explaination of 'bolt pattern' from the web:


*Bolt Patterns*

Each wheel has a different bolt pattern, and some wheels even have 2
different bolt patterns which allow it to be mounted on a wider range of
vehicles.

Most Bolt Patterns are represented in the following manner:
*4/100*

   - The &quot;4&quot; indicates the number of holes in the wheel for the bolts to
   enter and mount the wheel onto the car.
   - The &quot;100&quot; indicates the diameter of the bolt circle measured in
   millimeters or inches. 4 &amp; 6 bolt wheels are measured from the center of one
   bolt hole to the center of the bolt hole directly across from it. On a 5
   bolt pattern, it is a bit trickier to measure without special tools. Imagine
   a circle running through the centers of each bolt hole. You would measure
   from the center of one bolt hole to the imaginary circle that lays between
   the opposite two bolt holes.



So if the 12mm and the 14mm were milled through an identical center punch
pattern, the bolt pattern measurement would be the same.\

Thanks

&gt; You say:
&gt; &quot;This adapter bolts to your wide five VW rime with the same lug nuts that
&gt; hold the wheel to the car so you can finally get theose wheels balanced.
&gt;
&gt; Available for either 12mm or 14mm lugs. &quot;
&gt;
&gt; It's not clear to me how this solves the problem.
&gt;
&gt; One bolts a tire onto this plate and then this plate gets attached to the
&gt; balance machine? Is it for sure that the plate will fit most machines?
&gt;
&gt; Also, what is the diameter of the center hole, the diameter and weight of
&gt; the plate itself, and what is the bolt pattern for the 12mm and 14mm holes?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks....
