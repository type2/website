&gt;Gauges are good for baseline readings, and to see very quick fluctuations,

&gt;Even aircraft gauges are inaccurate, to a certain point, especially those
&gt;used in military aircraft. We never really worried alot about readings from
&gt;them,

With many years experience in the art of measurement, it is patently
apparent that these low cost guages cannot be relied upon for reality to
any kind of a small tolerance. Calibrated guages are available, but instead
of $59.95 they will run you $399.95. 

Note that such guages were not considered necessary by the factory. Think
about that. They weren't even offered as an option. Bad data can certainly
be worse than no data in some cases. If your procedure is not rigorous
enough to identify bad data so it can be thrown out, you have a procedural
deficientcy that can seriously attack your cost per mile with unnecessary
time/money wasted worrying about an indicated problem that is in reality no
problem at all.

For a temp guage, you can mark it for boiling point. Hook everything up on
the bench with the same length of wire/s installed. Put the sender in
boiling water. Mark or note the 212° position. If you have a thermometer,
let the pot cool and every so many degrees cooler, note the needle
positions. Empirical data is then closer at hand. And so nice to know that
when the needle gets near the high end, it is not to worry, don't pull
over, continue on knowing all is copacetic. 

Want better responce and higher accuracies??? Try braided copper wire. Much
less resistance per foot to add/subtract to/from the readings. Of course,
it costs 3 times the money or more. Watch that needle change when you
change the type of wire or it's length. With an ohm meter you can watch the
sender resistance rise as the temperature falls. If you take notes, you can
plot the line or curve as it may be. Inspection requires time at task. If
you must know the truth, you must do it yourself, with study first, then
practice, then application, with rigor, to prove the maximum error, the
tolerance inherent, in your procedure. 2 sigma confidence is great to
confirm. 

Now if I lived in Pheonix, before I bought a guage, I would get a Fluke or
better infrared hand held thermostat to do spot checking from time to time.
If that showed I was too many times a bit hotter than I liked, then I would
spring for a guage. It would not be a JC Whipme cheapy. VDO is as good as
it gets this side of superspendy. Rather than put the $399.95 out for
accurate temps I would put $500 extra into the verification and adjustment
to specs everything in the motor compartment. If your spec back there, you
have no need of guages as the Neandereers intended.
