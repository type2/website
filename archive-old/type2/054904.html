I found a very nice &amp; cheap jack at wal-mart.  It is the SUV hi-lift
model. It has a small saddle, so it makes engine pulls more of a balancing
act, but it was like $39.99 and has a 2 ton rating.  Lifts my busses right
off the ground when jacking from the beam or rear torsion tube..  Plenty
of range.

Sorry i cant give more details, but its sort of a blue grey color and i
think most all wal marts have it.  I have since seen it for the same price
i paid plus it included jack stands, though i cant vouch for the quality
of those.

take care,

Steve
