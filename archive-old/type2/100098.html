Subject: [T2] Carb Suggestion and head for 2.0 79 Bus

I am in the process of rebuilding my 79 2.0 Fuel Injected engine. I am not
going to put the fuel injection back on as of now and was wondering what
your guys suggestions on getting a carb would be? duals or a single? I had a
progressive on a bus a couple years back on a 74 and it performed great and
was reliable. I wouldn9t mind having another but would this be too
underpowered for a 2.0. What about duals are they worth it. I want this bus
to be reliable and easy to service. I don9t want to be adjusting every
couple weeks but I also want to use the power of a 2.0. Also I am wanting to
buy new heads anyone have any suggestions on quality heads and where to get
them. Price doesn9t matter I just want stock heads or what you guys
recommend on getting something that will last.
