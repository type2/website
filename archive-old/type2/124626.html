Subject: Loss of compression in newer 1600 Mexi

&gt; This time last year I bought a new 1600 Mexi DP for my '70 bus.

in a related issue, can I ask why there are quality issues between German, 
Mexican, and Brazilian VW parts if Germany is giving these countries the 
tools and molds, and if german engineers are overseeing materials 
procurement and quality control?
