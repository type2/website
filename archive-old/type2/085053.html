Subject: RE: [T2] where to buy a new engine?

&gt;The mechanic here says that even if I get a new case, there will be quite a
bit of labor involved transferring everything over. At $85/hour&lt;

First off where are you?  Many people may be able to recommend a good shop
in your area if we know your location.

A T1 magnesium case is almost impossible to weld up from what I have seen
(T4 and aluminum T1 can be welded).

Also $85 an hour is ridiculous for an air-cooled engine!  Sounds like dealer
prices to me....   Unless you know this is an awesome shop that will do a
perfect job which takes time.  

Call up Jake Raby http://www.aircooledtechnology_dot_com/ (GA) and have him
build you a great engine or Mark Dearing at Salem Imports (VA) or Boston
Bob.  All known good sources for engines.

I suspect the previous engine builder used a bad case to build your engine
to begin with if the mileage is low and the crack is not a &quot;dumb user&quot; type
of thing.  Ask him if he magnafluxed the case for cracks :)  Seriously, the
answer will be funny for sure.  IF he claims to be ultra high end then there
should have been better quality control, but a regular shop will not do this
to cases.  It will be interesting to see if the guy stands behind his engine
and work...

I good used case ready to go should cost 125-150.  A new case just check
around for a good price.


Good luck,
Adrian
