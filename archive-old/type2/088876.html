Subject: Fw: [T2] Engine Pulling Experience and Questions


Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Pulling Experience and Questions



 ----- Original Message -----
  However the tranny
 dropped as I pulled the engine away and hung down at an angle after I
 seperated the engine and transmission.

 use a second jack to support it, if you use a second trolly jack it will
 allow you to line up both engine and tranny easily



 Second, the moustache bar that supports the rear of the engine was in the
 way when trying to reinstall the engine.  Do people
 remove this and the muffler before removing or instaling the engine or do
 most people just keep it all attached and work around it.

 leave it on- it slips over the support brakets- if you have the engine on
 one jack and the trans supported on a 2nd jack as you offer up the engine
 you can slip it over the brkts,adj the trans position as you narrow the gap
 and when the moustach bar is in proper postion it only takes a nudge to
seat
 the engine home (most times ; ) )

 Third, I had a bear of a time getting the rear tin (the upright piece that
 acts as a firewall)

 should be several cheese screws to hold it firm


 Next to last, I dont seem to remember the top surface of the rear apron
 getting hot, but it seems to warm up right next to where the air hoses go
 through.  Can someone tell me if this is normal?

 yup, its right above the exhuast

 Last, I drained the oil and did added new oil after I was all done.  Now
the
 Drain Bolt seems to leak.  Am I supposed to use a new washer each time?

 yup, each and every time
