Friday at last. Ermal and his henchpeople of AVWA put on another great
bone-yards run in NC/SC/TN/GA last weekend. Don't know the final count, but
it was a large enough gathering to turn heads wherever we motored. Camp out
at Ermals place friday was particularly nice in that he let us &quot;wimps up
from Florida&quot; bag out in his heated garage. I took a non-VW buddy along and
he was duly impressed with the whole gang that showed up.

Special thanks to Clyde, who was a great help in solving the minor problems
with my new pride and joy...a cherry and absolutely bone-stock 71 SC.
Bought it last month from 84 year old orig owner, who is a neatfreak beyond
words. 94K miles. 17K on an ATK/VEGE rebuild. SO loves it cause EVERYTHING
works...unlike our other 5 VW's. Would like to lie and tell you we got it
for cheap..but we didn't:(. Mileage on the 1600 mile trip last weekend was
24+. This was a little higher than I had expected. Guess the weight
reduction/slightly slower cruising speed/1600 vs 2.0 liter/ and a spot-on
tune made the difference.

Now SO and I have all the VW/s we need. Well...maybe a KG? No, no, no!!
