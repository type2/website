Subject: Window Rubber Replacement Including the Chrome Strips?

------=_NextPart_000_000B_01C19366.7F396660
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hello, =20

  I have been told that when I have all the rubber around the windows =
replaced it will have to be without any chrome trim.  The reason being =
that it always breaks the windows upon replacement.

  My '68 will be undergoing some body work and painting very soon and I =
really would rather have all that lovely chrome back when the windows go =
back in.

  I have seen the rubber available that allows you  to re-insert the =
chrome around the edges.  Is this done post window installation? =20

  I keep hearing that nobody around here will put it back in.  I don't =
care if I keep the &quot;original&quot; trim or if I have to buy something else.  =
(Well, I kinda would like the old stuff...). =20

  Open to suggestions, I am in South Carolina so anything in nearby =
states would be considered and appreciated.

Thank you very much,
Jennifer of South Carolina
