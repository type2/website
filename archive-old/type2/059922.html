Subject: Axle beams

On 10/25, Chris said
&quot;The little nub on the front of the front axle beam has developed a tear in
the metal about 2 inches long making it difficult to steer and impossible to
convince my wife that there is any value in spending any more money on my
beloved 71 bus.  Any thoughts on replacement/repair?&quot;

Chris,
The axle beam is replaceable, (I have an exact replacement right down to the
brake pads if you need it).  Besides do you really want a V6 that has heat?
