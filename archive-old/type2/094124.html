&gt; An sae30 oil does the same, but may not pour

&gt; is a challenge :-)

I managed to find castrol 30 and 40 in most stores.

&gt;&gt; Also, I asked someone about a single grade oil like 30 and 40 but they said
&gt;&gt; it has a hard time circulating.
&gt; 
&gt; IMHO, this is pure bull.

I meant at morning temperatures.
 
&gt;&gt; What's good for our TypeIV engines?
&gt; 
&gt; Well, yes...  err... I dunno :-)  My religious belief is that I used to
&gt; run 20W-50 year round.  We had an oil thread last fall, tho that changed
&gt; my mind.  Karl, who I respect greatly, opined that at 250, the multigrade
&gt; oils may protect like the second number for a bit, but that the multi-vis
&gt; additives broke down quickly and you were left with straight weight oil of
&gt; the loser viscosity index.  This did match my experience, so this spring I
&gt; changed to straight weight SAE50W and in the fall I will change it to
&gt; SAE30W.  This is new to me, but so far it is working out.  We are just
&gt; starting into the 90/90 (90 degrees, 90% humidity) days here, so the
&gt; experiment is still running.

My bumper is incredibly hot after a few minutes of driving.  It's 90F
outside and I've never driver in this kind of heat before.

So why pick 50w over 20w50?
