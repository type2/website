What are the first 3 numbers of your vehicle identification number?

&gt; Well, I ran Suegro down to VW Bus Heaven yesterday. The folks down there
are
&gt; great, with plenty of knowledge to go around.
&gt;
&gt; I was looking (I thought) for the steering column bracket for Suegro, a
'69
&gt; Westy (I thought) hardtop.
&gt;
&gt; Bill had pulled a bracket and steering column for me, and when I arrived,
I
&gt; took it out to match against the bottom of the dash. The one already in
&gt; there doesn't match the holes in the bottom of the dash. But lo and
behold,
&gt; the bracket Bill offered was identical to the one I already had. It seems
&gt; the bracket wasn't the problem. It's the dash. At some point, someone
&gt; swapped out the dash for a newer one. So now I'm in search of a dash for a
&gt; '69.
&gt;
&gt; Also, Bill took a look around at the interior, and let me know that he was
&gt; pretty sure that Suegro was not really a Westy. It seems the AC connection
&gt; to the outside is in the wrong place (too far back), and the only
remaining
&gt; cabinet, the base of the bed is the wrong color. Too dark. It does have a
&gt; Westfalia plate riveted to it, so I'm confused. In addition, the door to
&gt; this cabinet is hinged at the top (not the bottom), and is bigger than the
&gt; hole in the face of the cabinet, rather than smaller with a rubber seal
(no
&gt; seal on mine).
&gt;
&gt; So, the questions begin:
&gt;
&gt; 1. Anyone have a lead on a '69 dash?
&gt;
&gt; 2. Any guesses as to how this bus was configured when it comes to
interior?
&gt; The hole in the floor for the sink is circular, not oval or oblong.
&gt;
&gt; Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!
&gt;
