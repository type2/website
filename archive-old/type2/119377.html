Subject: Re: [T2] chain saw blade oil undercoating

Hiya Matt,

I haven't tried this method but if you're really concered about rust I would
check out:
http://www.shagadelic_dot_org/VW/info/gmbulley-soundproof/

This suggests using a product called KoolPatch. I'm now using this and can
attest that it would take a lot to remove this once it's dry.

HTH,
Harry


Quoting &quot;Matthew J. Ramsey&quot; &lt;ramsey8_at_charter_dot_net&gt;:

*&gt; I've been reading the archives in reference to undercoating.  It seems
*&gt; the oil based method has been talked about quite a lot.  Others have
*&gt; suggest this to me as well.
