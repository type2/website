Subject: heater box bellows needed

        Dean,
        Little Martha came with the big black plastic bellows, I
gave them to someone else on the list and installed genuine Beetle
flexible steel hoses, about $1 each from Pick-n-Pull. Interestingly,
I had to cut down the Beetle hoses to fit my '70 single cab. Go
figure. Maybe mine were for the later type IV? Tin snips did the job,
and I tried to roll the cut edge to keep it from unravelling.

         Yes, I do get some engine noise through them, maybe the
plastic ones would be quieter, if you can find 'em. Plastic ones
were MUCH larger diameter with very deep corrigations- like
accordian larvae someone once said.

        I suppose you could use a combination of sheet-metal
and plastic irrigation parts to reproduce the originals, but I'd
use the old Beetle parts and be happy. I recall at least one end
of the Beetle flex tubes had red silicone rubber cuffs to seal the
joint to the heater box/fixed heater tube.

        Happy Motoring.
        Bill
