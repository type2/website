the rear axles nuts are 36mm, unless the tranny has been switched to a 64-67
with 46mm nuts

the front axle have a whole different set up.   Take off the hubcaps, if
applicable.  Take off  the bearing dust cap (use two hammers for this, a claw
hammer with e claws tucked against the dust cap as close to the drum as
possible, and a second to tap the peen end of the hammer metal).   There you
will find two nuts tightened against each other with a special lock washer
with arms.   Tap back the outer arm, the nuts are 24s I think, or is it 22?  I
usually use a adjustable wrench- it is not a high torque.   Then tap back the
other arm, etc....   Unless someone put later style on there which uses an
allen to undo it.

55-63 buses came with 15&quot; rims.  These are wider than the bug 15&quot; rims, though
the bolt pattern is the same.  The bus ones have 4 very noticable slots in
them.
