Subject: Shop windshield rust fix? 
Message-ID: &lt;37366DAF.37DB85F_at_west_dot_net&gt;

I've got my eye on a '76 Westy Deluxe with moderate to severe rust in
the window channel. (I can poke my fingernail through in places). The
rust of the bus looks pretty good...well, the fiberglass has seen better
days, but that's another saga fer sure.

I've been combing the archives &amp; associated web pages re: rust fixes &amp;
think I have a pretty good idea what's involved. (You guys make it all
look so easy to lop off a hunk of donor steel &amp; slap it in there. Nice
try, I'm not that gullible...)

I'd like to hear what kind of experience people have had getting this
stuff fixed by pros. Nitty gritty stuff like cost and success rate. TIA
