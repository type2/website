Subject: Re: [T2] ADMIN: New Library article - fuel lines

Billy,

Thanks for writing this. I am about to do this again to my bus, and it 
is nice to have a writeup as a review before I do the job. One thing I 
would add to the writeup though: replace the lines that connect the 
venting system located up in the vent channels above the battery trays. 
I did not do this the last time I did my lines, and I smelled gas when I 
filled up one day only to discover that I was leaking gas from this 
line. I didn't have spare line with me, and had to patch it with some 
water hose I did have, which I changed when we got home.
