Subject: need URL for Just Kampers
Date: Fri, 16 Oct 1998 01:54:02 -0500

I need the URL for Just Kampers. THis is the UK firm that sells all the
right tools at a reasonable cost (17 mm socket for 3/8&quot; drive, 46 mm socket
for 3/8&quot; drive, 6 mm for CV bolts) and I would like to order from them...
but cant locate them with Yahoo,webcrawler,etc. I know they have a website
because I have visited them before... but can't seem to find them now.
