Hello listers.  Again, many thanks for all the information that everyone =

hooked up.  Checked under dash, nada.  I can figure that part out, my =
question is this...On my voltage regualtor (bosch)  I have a short green =
wire, about 4 inches long that is just hanging there. Is this wire for =
my gen light?  Where does this wire go?  Thanks for any insight.
