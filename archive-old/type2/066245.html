Subject: Re: Master cylinder off, brake line advice?

&gt;Thoses hoses are at FLAPS, all tooled up and ready to go on. Splits + 68
&gt;use one size, 70-on uses another (I believe that's right). They don't even
&gt;cost very much, I think my last one was about $8.50.
&gt;
&gt;The tool you want for brake lines is one of those wrenches that looks like
&gt;a box wrench with a slot cut in it. It lets you grip most of the points
&gt;while the cut-out part slides past the brake line. Don't ever use an open
&gt;end wrench on those, you'll round them off (you already found this out,
&gt;right?) ;)

With my luck I'd need one for a '69! 
If you are going to buy a flare wrench you might think about getting a flare
crowsfoot instead. I have used those on harder to get to lines. 

Rob.
