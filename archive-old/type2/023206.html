Subject: Re: [T2] Carpet vs. Linoleum

&gt;Was wondering if one was better then the other?  I am putting a
&gt;Westfalia interior in my bus so was wondering if I should use carpet
&gt;or linoleum (with the carpet I probably will just lay it down on the
&gt;bus floor, with linoleum I would put a thin piece of plywood down and
&gt;the glue the linoleum to that) or is this just a personal preference?
&gt;Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Go with the linoleum.  My wife and I just took out the carpeting that a PO 
put in and replaced it with tile.  The linoleum will be easier to keep 
clean, and you can always put a throw rug over the linoleum.  We used 9/16&quot; 
plywood.  We used regular grade plywood although the Home Depot guy 
recommended the Floor Grade.  We put on some &quot;Armstrong Fast Setting Patch 
and Skim Coat&quot; (S-184) on the plywood to even out the rough 
surface.  Instead of linoleum, we used tile squares which were 
self-adhesive.  It looks great and was relatively inexpensive.

Hope this Helps,

Joel
