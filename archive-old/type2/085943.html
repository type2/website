Subject: Re: [T2] Welding fabrication???

	Hi Chris,
I just ordered a New VW front beam from Bus Depot for the purpose of adding 
the disc brakes.  I even have plans to add power-assist to the steering.  I 
have a '96 Passat w/VR6, so I've checked the dimensions pretty thoroughly, 
and I believe it will be a pleasant(as pleasant as they get) transplant.  
The engine height and width seem well within the space limitations of the 
engine comp.  I have checked out Kennedy's website to find the flywheel and 
adapter info on this swap.  The tranny is out of a '79 Type2 and will need a 
thorough internal update when the time comes to drop in the V6.  As far as 
weight in the rear is concerned, it will be heavier, but with 
coilovers(already installed) and some tweaks to the spring-plates, I think 
it will be fine.  The radiator will offset the weight up front, as this is 
the only place to mount the thing.  I alrady have the A/C lines and 
condenser mounted toward the rear.  I know what you mean about the 
access-panel.  I nearly bought a later-model for this reason, but I love my 
'70 too much to part with her. Thank you for your outlook and advice, 
perhaps you could tell me about your Corvair swap.

&gt;
&gt;What tranny are you using? Just curious.
&gt;
&gt;Every transplant I have been involved in - hot rod or VW has involved the
&gt;same process.
&gt;
&gt;Position the engine in the body where you want it to sit, create a cross
&gt;member our of square tubing with gussets between the OEM engine motor
&gt;mounts. Then we created gusset-ed square tubing to connect the cross member
&gt;to the frame - in this case the OEM baywindow locations would be easiest
&gt;because they are already braced for engine weight. You might have to create
&gt;new cross member attachment points too.
&gt;
&gt;You can pay somebody to do it at $50 an hour or you can lean some basic
&gt;welding, buy a miter saw for steel, and a basic welder - and then create
&gt;the brackets and crossmembers with spot welds and have an expert properly
&gt;finish weld everything. Lastly paint or powdercoat it all.
&gt;
&gt;The whole process will require alot of careful engineering to ensure that
&gt;you don't obstruct exhaust or intake or control cables or anything else
&gt;that can't be relocated on the engine.
&gt;
&gt;Sure would be nice to have that engine access panel uptop. It maybe
&gt;required to complete the task.
&gt;
&gt;I'd look at the Tiico conversions because the brackets will all be very
&gt;similar - but will aim for different frame mounting points because your
&gt;vehicle is different. Basically you've got to create a stronger moustache
&gt;bar. The other existing engine conversions tackle the exact problems you
&gt;will with the VR-6 but the shape and size of the brackets will be a bit
&gt;different. No patterns for VR-6 engines in baywindows that I know of and if
&gt;there was it might be difficult to get the owner of the design to release
&gt;it to you - if it was a money maker for them.
&gt;
&gt;Once it is welded/bolted it correctly, connect electrical, fluids, and
&gt;controls and you are ready for exhaust and radiators.
&gt;
&gt;No small task.
&gt;
&gt;Have you considered the weight of the engine as compared to the vehicle's
&gt;weight distribution? If the VR-6 is alot heavier - I dunno - you're going
&gt;to have to deal with that. Assuming it is - have you tried loading sandbags
&gt;in the rear most of the passenger compartment and driving it around to see
&gt;if it pulls too much weight off of the front that it affects the wet road
&gt;braking abilities? Have you considered disc brakes since drum brakes
&gt;overheat so easily? Have you considered how the low geared VW Type 1
&gt;powered bus tranny will deal with 200 horses and how much nicer a higher
&gt;gear ratio would be - less noise, more durability, better mpg...
&gt;
&gt;I'm not trying to aggravate you but it is a big job with alot to consider.
&gt;Kennedy offers conversion parts and guidance, dunno if they have done this
&gt;type job. You'll need custom flywheel, clutch, and an adapter plate to bolt
&gt;the VR-6 to a early baywindow bus tranny.
&gt;
&gt;I am working through a Corvair transplant which gives me 110 unrefined
&gt;horsepower - more if - even 200 - if I want to really build a special
&gt;engine with combustion chamber refinements and modern engine controls. Most
&gt;of these topics to consider that I mentioned above were topics for me to
&gt;consider as well - as would any person doing a custom transplant. I've
&gt;completed my armchair engineering and am simply waiting for the time to do
&gt;the work. 101 things taking up my time so that I can't work on it.
&gt;
&gt;Good luck and keep us updated.
