Subject: 1970 Camper w/ 1971 engine
Message-ID: &lt;19991008173442.1881.rocketmail_at_web122.yahoomail_dot_com&gt;

I am having trouble mounting my rebuilt 1971 engine in
my 1970 camper. Does anyone know of any after-market
products that would help me overcome the fact that the
two years differ in mounting positions? Any help would
be greatly appreciated as my engine is sitting on the
exhaust right now. I had a mechanic tell me he could
fabricate some motor mounts for it and it turned out
all he did was weld it in place. I know I need
something that will allow for the natural vibration of
the engine, I just need a lead on how to find such a
part.
Thankz,
Charlie White
