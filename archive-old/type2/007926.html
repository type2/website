Subject: Bosh AL82X Altenator hook up
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I replaced the 1600sp in my bus with a 1600dp.The 1600dp has a bosh AL82X altenator on it.Since very little on my bus is origanal equipment I have no idea where to hook the wires.The instructions I recived from the person I bought the motor from do not work.They say to hook one wire,the front one, to the battery side of the solidnoid and the other to the gen light.When I do this the alt becomes a big magnet.The alt has two wires comming out of the top of it.The back one,back being back of bus,has a B+ by it the front one has a male part of a push on conector.If anyone can tell me how to hook this up or what part I may be missing it will be a big help.My bus has so many strange not stock parts on it I am thinking about calling it Frankenbus.Tim Linke
