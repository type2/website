Phil,

Thanks for looking this up. I wrote down 0237 02 300, but I probably
forgot a 0 which would make the correct Bosch # 0237 002 300. Above the
Bosch number, a third number reads: Z 414. I pulled it off a 2L
air-cooled CU engine, so there is a good chance that it is in your book.

Thanks,
Marcus

O.K. here we go again, you gave us the VW # 071 905
205, now give me the Bosch number which is above the
VW one, my book won't cross reference the VW # to a
Bosch distrubtor. Also my book only goes up to 1988. Phil
