Definately your backing plates even though you have checked them.  As you 
turn in one direction the drum is shifted up against the backing plate and 
rubs.  As you turn in the opposite direction the drum is pulled away from the 
backing plate and doesn't make any noise.  BTDT(been there, done that).
