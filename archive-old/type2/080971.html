(1)No
(2)I wouldn't, that is where the majority of the vehicle weight rides.  I
don't cut corners on steering/suspension/brakes.  The life or me and my
loved ones make whatever money saved seem pretty insignificant should they
get hurt.

Good luck,
Bill

Subject: [T2] Lower L/H Ball Joint Removal (?)


&gt;
&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; On my inspection last Friday I got snagged for the Lower L/H Ball Joint -
I
&gt; understand there is too much play.
&gt;
&gt; (1) Is there a way to tighten this up without replacing the Ball Joint (?)
&gt; (2) If I need to replace, is it true that it's not necessary to follow the
&gt; Bentley procedure?  Has anyone tried to heat it up (as mentioned in the
&gt; Library) and then whack it out?  Can I do this job for the first time by
&gt; myself?  Do I need the press as per book?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt; Shawn
&gt; Montreal, Qc
&gt; Close to passing inspection on my '73 - 6 Snags remaining.
