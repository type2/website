Subject: Re: [Working Fridge]

Jeff, Did you learn alot about that thing getting it running?

I have a fridge out of 78 in my 74 - but all i have is the fridge (Dometic). 
It has a plug coming out from under the plate with the 'cooler' adjustment
knob that is marked '12v'.
I don't see a compressor anywhere and i know the thing has ammonia in it.

How's this thing work?  We apllied 12v to it for a while, but the only thing
that happened was that the spot the other end of the wire hooks to - whatever
that it is  - got hot.

thanks,
clark
