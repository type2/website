&gt; &lt;&lt; My second question is about installing a cigarette lighter, I have heard 
&gt; it 
&gt;  is relatively easy and was wondering if someone could give me some 
&gt;  tips/instructions
&gt;  T &gt;&gt;

I _really_ like where i put my lighter. Its easy to get to and you cant
see it unless you look close.

I got one with a chrome bracket at auto-zone, its called an auxilliary
socket and comes with a rubber cap (i took off the rubber cap)

it comes set up like this (it doesnt come with the lighter itself, must be
purchased separately)

---------     &lt;--- part of braket with screw hole to attach to dash
        |
        |==={  &lt;-- knob
        |

What i did was flip it around so that the knob is recessed below and
behind the dash...

|==={

I actually put the bracket above the lower dash lip rather than below so
you cant even see the braket. you just end up with a lighter hanging down
on a chrome braket at the back edge of your dash's lower lip.  My dash
already had a hole for the screw in the perfect place so i didnt even have
to drill.  All i needed to do was use a couple of washers to level the
braket out as the under dash lip kinda has a rolled edge toward the front
of the bus.

If i ever get a digital camera i'll post a picture.

peas,

Steve

p.s. i used a dog collar spike from my punk-rock days to attach it, but
alas it came unscrewed and i had to replace it with a regular bolt..
