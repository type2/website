Subject: front axle beam installation (Chapter 1)

Volks,

Today I stated in on installing the new front axle beam I recently
purchased from Bus Depot.  I brought my camera with me and began taking
pictures as I removed each piece.  I have put those pictures at:

http://www.everybus_dot_com/axle_beam/index.htm

I will add to that as I go along and hope that by the end I will have a
full photo-essay on replacing an axle beam.

I hope to compose text pages to go with the pictures, but in the mean
time, I will post comments on each days progress.

First, if you think you might be doing this soon, watch closely!  Learn
from my mistakes! :-)  I have been thru this before, but have never tried
to document it.  Second, if you have been thru this, or think you might go
thru this, and you see a procedure or section go by and you don't
understand it, or think it should be added to, let me know!!  I would love
to have comments on the procedure so I can make it comprehensible and
comprehensive.

Todays work went smoothly in most sections, but not smoothly in all.

The speedo cable came out easily.  it is never really a problem, just take
off the circlip and don't lose it :-) pull the cable out from behind the
steering knuckle and pass it back thru the beam

The brake caliper:  The clip that holds the flex line on came away very
peacefully!  lots of penetrating oil helped, but be careful to keep that
oil away from the rotor!  The upper and lower caliper bolts came off per
spec.  These are high torque bolts and require a 19mm socket on a long
breaker bar to loosen.  After that, hope that your pads are old and your
rotor is new :-)  prying the caliper away from an old rotor with new pads
installed is a bit of a... err...  bear, yeah, bear, that's the word I
want (not really :-)

Once the caliper is off, hang it out of the way using a *stiff* piece of
wire.  It is heavy and will pull a slack piece right off!

Tie rod was easy, since I had the right tool.  The nut is either a
cottered 19mm castle nut (in my case) or a nylock.  Once the nut is off,
you need to pop the end out of the arm on the steering knuckle I recently
bought a posilock 3-arm puller at Sears (http://www.posilock_dot_com/).  They
are not cheap ($80), but worth every penny!!!

Shock mount bolts... I cheated here... This beam went on less than 3 years
ago and the shock mount bolts were replaced at that time...  lots of
penetrating oil, a little torque from the 24&quot; breaker bar with a 19mm
socket and off they came. On the upper, hold the nut behind the horn on
top of the beam wiht a 19mm wrench.  YMMV!  YMM *especially* V if you have
30-year-old factory original shocks and bolts!!!  bring a torch along!

Sway bar... Despite what the photos show, I am having a problem with the
sway bar.  The nut (17mm) came off the top just dandy, but the bolt (17mm)
is binding something fierce.  Also, the bushing is being its usual
non-cooperative self.  The sway bar bushing is the reason I own the
Vice-Grip 12-LC pliers you see featured prominently throught the piece.
Usually if you compress the bushing a bit, the clip will slide right off.
This one is being recalcitrant.  Becasue of these difficulties, (and the
temp dropping below freezing :), I stopped for the evening and will give
the penetrating oil a bit more time to work its way in.

So that's as far as I got today.  I will report further progress tomorrow,
if there is any.  It is supposed to snow here tomorrow and I don't want to
get caught in the boonies, so I may postpone (again :-(
