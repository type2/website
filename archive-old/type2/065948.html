Subject: Trip to Lymington

Hi,

Went to Lymington (my home town) last w/e with Damon
(my boyfriend) in order to strip the '59 bug for resto.

A friend of ours is shutting down his Aircooled VW restoration
business and had some stuff he wanted to shift. Damon picked
up 2 1955 Beetle engines (one of which apparently runs). At
the moment these are sitting in the garden, but they are soon
to take up residence in our sitting room. It's all Clara's fault --
she must have given him the idea!!! (we had Clara's engine
sitting on our porch for a few days when she visited!). Also
various other bug stuff (nothing very exciting -- all the good
stuff was sold long ago).

He also has a bay-window era awning stuck on a very high
shelf. He said he'd keep it for us once he got round to sorting
that shelf out. Trouble is, we've sold the '71 bus -- is there a
way I could get it to fit my '62?

Another friend of ours has recently acquired a '63 Notchback
in quite nice condition (considering...). He can't keep it as
he's already up to his neck restoring a Ghia &amp; 2 bugs. If anyone's
interested (remember it's in the U.K.) I can send details and,
in time, photos. It will be priced to sell. 

Yet another friend is selling his '65? '66? bus. I'll make a separate
post about it.

On the way home (loaded down with 2 engines, 2 large
toolboxes &amp; other assorted oily crap), Splitty started making
horrible scraping noises going round left-hand corners. It
seems to be coming from the front right hand hub. We thought
it might just go away when the load was removed, but no.
No loss of brakes or handling quality. This was the first time
in my life I traveled without my jack... typical, eh? All we could
do was check the wheel was on securely.

i think either the backing plate (or something else in the
hub) is loose, or the bearing is shot. Ideas? Hub is coming
off as soon as I get a chance (meanwhile Splitty shelters from
the miserable West Country rain in the expensive garage :-)
