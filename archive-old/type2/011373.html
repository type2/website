Subject: Wheel interchange?
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I am converting a 86syncro Vanagon to a car hauler for
bugs and buses and wish to put more truck like tires
and wheels in place of the stock 5 lugs and all I can
find so far are late model Mercedes(too pricey),any
ideas will greatly appreciated. Stock wheels are 14&quot;
and I hope to find 16&quot; or so to fit my hubs.          
     Thanks in advance for your input.   Wayne
