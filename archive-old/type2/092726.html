&gt;Hello,
&gt;
&gt;I am installing this gauge in my air-cooled vanagon.  The hose that came 
&gt;with the kit is not long enough..it was quite sturdy.  would regular

Yes, regular vacuum hose will work fine.  It seems you can have an almost 
infinite length of it and still get good readings so don't worry about 
that.  I had a spool of 100ft of vacuum hose and just for fun plumbed it in 
to the line to my vacuum gauge.  No apparent difference in readings or 
responsiveness of the gauge.

You could also do what I did and move the oneway valve in your brake 
booster line up towards the front of the bus (near the booster), then put a 
tee just behind it and hook your vacuum hose up there.
