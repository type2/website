I'll add a few sheckels worth.

I think you need to get a torque curve on the motor and a gearing calculator
(such as scottandmaggies_dot_com) before you dismiss using a 4-speed.

If the motor revs high (&gt;6000 rpm), the jump down in RPM (during shifting)
may not drop below the motors torque range. This will be most noticable from
1st to 2nd gear.

For instance, with Itch's gearing, running 6K in first (25mph) would drop to
3200 rpm in second. If the target motor puts out strong torque (or, at least
stronger torque than a standard VW motor) from 2000 on up, you could shift
from 1st gear at 4000 rpm, and still have a torque band behind you.

You would still be looking at 3200+ rpm _at_ 60 mph, though, so you'd
definitely want to be running efficiently in the entire 3000 rpm range.

&gt; &gt; Before you totaly dismiss the stock VW bus tranaxle, I would go to this
&gt; &gt; site:  http://www.baja_dot_com/kombi On this site there are several Subaru
&gt; &gt; powered VWs, some Bus, some Bug. They all use a VW trans. There are also
a
&gt; &gt; lot of other Buses powered by V8's and V6's that use the stock VW trans,
&gt; &gt; both the 002's and the 091's. This is an Aussie site and I think it
belongs
&gt; &gt; to a list member. He may be able to answer a lot of questions for you.
&gt;
&gt; Yes, the bus transaxle can be built up to handle more power, but even then
&gt; it is a 4-speed with limited ratios.
