Hello list,

At the risk of criticism, I am going to throw this
question out there. Is the curvature of the roof of
the old splitties similar to the roof curvature of the
later model busses? What I mean is, can you install a
pre 68 center pop top on a post 68 bus. I know that a
lot of modification will be needed for the opening,
and to make sure it seals on the roof when closed.
Besides the body line on the roof of the later buses,
would the curvature be similar enough? I know body
work, can do welding an have access to metal
forming/cutting machinery, and a body shop.

I know a basic seat would need to be built so that it
would seal, but I want to make sure that it wouldn't
look too funny if I pulled it off.

I know such a radical idea would disgust any avid
stock VW enthusiast. Right now, it is just an idea.

Any suggestions, opinions or condemnations are
welcome.

Thanks,

David Kelly 
From Wilmington, North Carolina
