Subject: Our Thanks

Hi Folks, for some of you, this may be a &quot;double post&quot;
as I am sending this to a couple of lists. 
 
As you may know my motor went for a dive on Thursday
on route from Ontario to North Carolina. 
This happened without warning or prediction. When it
went, I thought all I had was a badly burnt starter. 
I was going up a hill on I-79. My CHT was reading
about 330 - 340, rpms around 3500. I had adjusted the
valves prior to leaving, and there was no signs of a
stretched valve. When it went, there was no 'bang', or
'clatter'. I chose to pull over because my volt meter
was going nuts and my rpm's had suddenly gone up to
about 5000 rpm and the bus just didn't &quot;feel right&quot;. 
There we sat, waiting for a tow-truck, for about 4
hours.

Luckily, and by the grace of friendship, we are all
safe and home.

Many people helped us out on this journey. Including
many people at Everybus who's names I do not know. In
the throes of trying to get the bus back together in
an AutoZone parking lot, the kind people at Everybus
were taking a donation collection to help get us own
there. Their goal was to get us in a rental car, and
get us down there, as we had on board over 130
everybus t-shirts, and 2 kids! In the end the money
that was raised was enough to get us there. 

Since I do not know who contributed, I would just like
to send out a general &quot;thank you&quot; to the VW community
for banding together and getting us down there. 

All of your thoughts, phone calls, and contributions
made our predicatment a lot easier to handle. 

And of course, Den and Ev, who dropped everything,
loaded a short block, 2 heads, 4 P&amp;C's and hundreds of
gaskets in their car, and drove from Erin Ontario all
the way to Grove City to help me build a motor, and
install it in an AutoZone parking lot, in a thunder
storm. We can't possibly thank you enough.

Thank you, 
Adam, Heather, and family.
