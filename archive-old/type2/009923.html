Hi list,

	Well, we successfully removed the engine from the bus.  I'll be
honest ... I have been uptight most of the day, but my father - who has
rebuilt many NON-VW engines - was very calm and professional.  Helped out
a lot. :)

	But, we have a few questions now ... actually, six to be specific.
I'll outline them:

	- How can you tell if a transaxle CV joint boot (not sure if this
is VW lingo ... my father said this is what they were called when he
worked on them) is bad and/or needs to be replaced?  The boot on the right
side of the bus was cracked and we fear that it will lose grease soon.  Is
it a major problem to replace these?  If labor is the main thing then I'm
not incredibly worried ... money is the main issue.

	- We found that the cooling system had been removed from the
engine - there aren't any flaps, linkages, cables or a thermostat.  How
much difficulty is it to replace all of this, and are the parts available?
We just glanced in &quot;The Bus Depot&quot; catalog and didn't see the necessary
parts ... are there resources for this type of thing?  And would I have
problems this winter if I don't fix it?

	- How do we set the timing for the engine?  We assumed that there
would be a cap in the fan belt housing unit, so that we could make the
adjustment ... but, we didn't see one.  We have been using a few books for
this rebuild, and each book suggested that we would find this cap, but we
didn't.  Is this strange?

	 - We were surprised when we removed the heat exchangers/exhaust
manifolds ... this is all one unit?  And, is there a way to test it for
exhaust leaks, or to dismantle it for repair?  We had an exhaust leak
before we dropped the engine, and couldn't find it .. is it possible that
the leak could have been in the exhanger/manifold?

	- Another major problem I have had is the old EGR system ... the
PO decided to remove the system and clamp the old injectors closed ...
well, they never were closed properly and hence we always had some exhaust
leak.  Does anyone have a good suggestion as to how we can plug the EGR
injector nozzle holes?  There are three of them - two on the right side
and one on the left.  We thought about bolts and fixing them in there with
some sort of adhesive ... is this the best way?

	- And last - but not least - what is the best solvent for cleaning
and degreasing the engine parts?  We don't want a water based cleanser,
for fear of rusting, but don't want to use something like gasoline, for
obvious reasons.

	Thanks guys ... I know this is a ton, but we could use the help.
You guys are the best.

	By the way, I drive a 1974 VW Bus, 1800 cc engine, once dual-carbs
but now single carb, and manual transmission.

	Take care, and thanks in advance.

	   - Wade
