&gt; &gt; You actually need to pull off the CV and flip it over and then

&gt; No, what you need to do is swap the axles side for side.  Put the left on
&gt; the right and vice versa.  You _don't_ have to remove the CVs from the
&gt; axle.

And, lastly, for the dyslexics among us... :-)

If you can keep track of the orientation and loading of both ends of both
half-shafts, you are way ahead of me and either of the above will do.  If
not, what you need to do is to make sure it is loaded in the opposite
direction when you reinstall the CV.  The best way to do this is to clean
the livin' tar (and believe me, some of that tar is *livin'*! :) out of a
spot on the outside edge of each CV before you remove them and mark the
direction of rotation on the edge of the CV.  You know, an arrow.  Use
something that is not petroleum soluble, like a carbide scratch awl or a
die grinder.  Then make sure that when you put them back on, the arrow
points the other way.

Second, flopping axles will flop the direction, and you don't need to pull
the joints to flop the axles. *But* once you have the axles off, if you
don't clean and regrease them before reinstalling them, I promise you that
after you die, Ben Pon *will* chase you thru the aisles of eternity
scourging you for the rest of time with a frayed clutch cable :-)  And to
really clean and regrease them, you need to remove them from the half
shaft, becasue there is no way to get the cage off the inner hub with the
inner hub on the shaft.

Someone said that there is an inside and an outside to CV's.  I know that
there is a ring engraved on the outer race, and a bevel on the cage and a
raised ridge on inner race. I *think* that they are supposed to face the
hub or trans, but over the years, I have seen them in installed in pretty
nearly every orientation as I have disassembled various CV's and I have
not seen that it made any great difference.  Do keep all the parts of any
one CV together, as they did make the ball bearings in different diameters
thru the years, but I don't think that the orientation of any part makes
any difference.

Any further opposing viewpoints? :-)
