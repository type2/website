Subject: Re: Removing/reinstalling pilot shaft trans seal

Hi Bill:

Have you used this type of seal puller when the input shaft is still in
the seal? It would seem that the puller is too big to fit.  I practiced
last night with an idea from Scott Lyons on a seal in an old bellhousing,
and had no luck at all. After tearing the seal up pretty good without any
luck, I then  tried to pound out the seal just to get an idea of how hard
it is pressed in. I now have just a torn up seal still in the old
bellhousing.

So I really need to either make a good seal removal tool or to find the
correct version before I try it on the good transmission. Anyone have any
other good ideas?

TIA
Regards,
