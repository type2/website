&gt; Hey list geniuses,
&gt; I recently got my engine back from a rebuild by
&gt; AVP and am trying to replace the oil sump plate with a different one I
&gt; have that has an oil-temp sender in it. But though I've removed the
&gt; screws, I cannot seem to get that sucker off there. AVP coated the
&gt; circumference of the plate with silicone and that seems to be
holding it
&gt; in. Also I can't really get a purchase on the thing and don't want to
&gt; ruin the sealing areas by gouging screwdrivers in there.. Any ideas?

Try running a knife or razor blade around the plate to cut the
silicone.  This might break things loose.

I wonder about a rebuilder who uses that much silicone on an engine.
