1972 Bus for sale. All new brakes, original interior, needs some engine
work, have spare parts $2000obo

I bought a bug in hopes that I would be able to drive it and restore the
bus, so I wouldn't have to rush into the bus as my daily driver.
Unfortunately, I ended up spending more on the bug than it would have cost
to make the bus worth while. If I can get rid of this bus, I can pay off my
debt and try to resurrect an oval bug or barndoor bus somewhere in Arizona.
Only put it in there if your looking for this kind of thing.

Thom
