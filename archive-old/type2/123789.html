Subject: Brake fluid leakage

Hi all,

On my 468 - type 2 bus there is a small leakage of brake fluid, situated
between the rear sealing plug at the master cylinder and the rear of the
twin-chamber reservoir. The master cylinder has been changed for an new one
two years ago. I havent disassembled yet, but which of the two is probably
leaking? Or will I only have to replace a sealing? Any tips for this job?

By the way, I like the kind way you all help each other. I mean it. Today
some guys with too much testosteron where throwing dirty words at each other
on the forum of the Belgian beetle-club. They only go for a perfect car to
show off each other. I am glad to notice there are still some people-loving
Americans. Keep up the love and the good work!

Bart
