&gt; But where is the point of disagreement?  You took the half-shafts off the
&gt; bus, you took the joints off the half-shaft, you installed the new boots,
&gt; you cleaned them, and you put new grease in them. Exactly what I would
&gt; have done!

needed to do one of mine today, (have done two others recently) but this
one just didn't want to come off. so used the gear puller, new one of
course wants no part of going on. 

so here I sit, half shaft is in the freezer in the basement, CV joint goes
into the oven in the morning, set up the press....hopefully I'm ready to
go at first light.

but I have never had one of these buggers on so tight and I've done a lot
of CV joints over the years...looked though before I took the old one off
it floated free on the inner part of the spline shaft only problem is
outboard of the snap ring.. debateing taking a little off the outer part,
there is very little presure against that snap ring, as long as it stays
on.

any comments from someone who has run into this before????

(oh the problem getting it to idle, one of the valve adjuster lock nuts
was stripped and wouldn't lock the exhaust valve adjuster,,,,always
something new to drive me nuts!!)
