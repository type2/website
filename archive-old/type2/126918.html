Subject: door jam triangle?

Hi all..could you please look at this pic. real quick and tell me if you've ever seen this &quot;triangle shaped thingy&quot; in the bottom corner of the front door jam?  It's kind of a hard cardboard/plastic and I had one on each side and were torn off by my painter.  They were contact-cemented in.
 I'm just wondering if they are STOCK or if someone stuck them on for some reason?  I will put them back on if they are stock.  Please let me know!
thanks for the help!  ALL responses welcome, seen it or not!
