There was a lot of talk less than a year ago about replacing cv boots.  I
myself changed mine then using German replacements.  Well as you might guess
they are already ripped.  Did any one find a company that sells replacement
boots that actually survive over a year???  It isn't a hard job but a very
nasty one I would rather not do more than once a year.
