Subject: Rockford CV, group Purchase?

I also need a set for my '70 to change when I swap the tranny out.  Is
anyone interested in being part of a group purchase from Rockford CV?

Back in early Nov., Barry B suggested that model 339-4 is a better fit than
the 814-21 that listed on the website:
http://www.rockfordcv_dot_com/Volkswagen_bootkits.htm
Is mail order a good way to go with them?  Looks like they are set up for
wholesale.

Alternatively, I would not be averse to buying from any bus-special vendor
who would care to stock them.
