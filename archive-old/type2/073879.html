Subject: Is my engine seized? Please help!

Hello all,

    Me and my '72 Riviera need some help that I can't find answers to in the
archives.  I've just finished grinding out my old pilot bearing (what a
lousy job that is!).   I was hand turning the engine as I ground it out to
get a better angle on it and suddenly I couldn't turn it anymore.  I didn't
try real hard and didn't think much about it until I was reinstalling my
flywheel and didn't have to brace the engine at all to torque the bolts
down.   I can't get the engine to turn at all now!   What have I done....
and, more importantly, how can I fix it?   Your help would be immensely
appreciated.   The engine ran fine before I removed it and turned fine by
hand once I had it out.... until it didn't.
