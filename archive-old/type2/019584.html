As with an engine rebuild, I use a lot of various size baggies and mark each with
a black magic marker to clearly indicate where the part or parts come from.  I
never know when my project will be interupted.  And I hated all bolts, screws,
nuts and parts comingled in a large pan or box.

&quot; &gt;I want to do a ground up restoration but don't know where to start.

&gt; ...........I know you aren't a dummy, Steve. Wherever you start, take
&gt; photos and keep detailed records of what attaches to what and how, and use
&gt; tags on the ends of wires and hoses, so you can match them up again in 6
&gt; months, after your short term memory has been flashed.

I vote that keeping em on the road, returning em to the road, and restoring them
all involve the skills required to maintain em.

Mike
