&gt; I'm getting tires for my 74 westy tomorrow.  Local dealer (small
town) only has C or D rated 185r14 tires in a &quot;for trailer use only&quot;. 
I've been using a 205/75r14 passenger tires on my 75 transporter with
no handling problems, but I thought the C or D rating would be better
with the heavier camper.  Does anyone know what makes &quot;trailer use
only&quot; tires different from others?

Often there is no difference other than that the tires haven't been
DOT rated for passenger use.  No paperwork-no rating!

OTOH, any tire dealer can usually get the tires you want, if you know
the model and size.  Any Firestone dealer can get Bridgestones (FS is
owned by BS).  Lots of Yokohama dealers out there too.

Dealers usually would prefer to sell you what they have on the shelf,
so they won't suggest ordering the correct tire.  If you ask them
&quot;would you order me a...&quot; mentioning the specific make, model, and
load range they will usually get you the right tire.  They just don't
want to be stuck with a oddball tire if you back out of the deal. 
Money up front will keep any dealer happy!

I know that you are pressed for time, but keep in mind that you will
have to live with these tires for longer then most marriages last.  Be
sure you get tires with which you will be happy!
