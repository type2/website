BORRRING!!!!!!!!!  That's the word that best describes this FART.

OK, some folks have had bad experiences with Bus Depot (mostly related to
speed/timing and poor communications).  Others have had good experiences
(low prices, good service, and dealing with a fellow bus-nut).  I've had
both in my dealings with them.  Both experiences have a right to be relayed
to the group as long as the facts are properly presented (which they were in
the post that started this tirade).  

Shouldn't that be the end of it???
