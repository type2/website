Subject: Re: [T2] Where are all the busses?

When I lived in Laguna Beach and Dana Point (South OC, CA) I saw  
buses all the time. I had friends who drove buses, and usually bugs  
as well.

Plenty to be seen at Saddleback College where I went to school...not  
too many Westies, though. Mostly buses and older Splitties.

Here in Charleston, we know the majority of bus owners (what, maybe 3  
or 4???) and our buddy Snoopy owns the most (4 and a parts bus).

Still, the only bus we ever see on the road here is our own.

&gt; Hi All,

&gt; Since driving my bus for about 2 months now, I've come to the  
&gt; conclusion
&gt; that there's only about 1 other bus in this area (Pasco County,  
&gt; Florida)
&gt; that anybody actually *drives*  I've seen a handful parked in  
&gt; driveways,
&gt; on the sides of houses, and even 1 at a less-than-reputable repair  
&gt; shop,
&gt; gathering rust as it sits quietly in the weeds.
