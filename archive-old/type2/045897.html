Well 70's came with a front mounted spare tire. The rather large dent that
you see behind it is from people using the tire as a bumper. Its one of the
most common body flaws you can find. There are not too many buses out there
without this dent. Thats why it is always a good idea to keep that tire
there. Buy yourself a nice new tire all black and shiny and get a real nice
&quot;disk&quot; moon eye style hubcap. It gives your bus a real classic look. Spend
your money on some other more readily noticed aspect of your buses exterior.
Just my two cents. keep the change.
