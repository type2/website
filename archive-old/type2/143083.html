Subject: Re: There's always more to the story... - Update

Volvo's home. There's a short somewhere. I had the GWB idling and jumpers to
the volvo. 13.46 or whatever volts would drop to 11.3 if I turned the
starter on the Volvo. And STICK THERE even after I removed the key until I
pulled one jumper clamp up and then put it back on. Really odd. Something's
shorting and stays shorting until power drops. A relay maybe? Hmm... The OD
relay's been bad for a while... Anybody got one?

Now back to the bus. Troy picked me up this morning and took me back to his
place where the poor GWB was resting after pulling it out of his backyard. I
reconnected the booster line (d'oh!) and fired it up. I was hoping that big
fat vacuum leak was causing the smoke. Nope. It's just running extremely
rich. It's idling high because I set the idle with the booster line
disconnected. I'll mess with it again later today.

I'm wondering if it's worth it to have a shop do the carbs? They're balanced
now for the first time in a year (that head) so that's nice.

Is there more power with all 4 cylinders firing? Hmm.. Not really, but again
it's running rich. However the power band is much smoother and there's no
sudden power dropoff at 4400rpm. It kept pulling up until 4800 when I backed
off.

I now have 2 useless exhaust studs. The snapped off one on the drivers side,
and one on the new head. Not because it's bad (though the threads were so
worn that the 2 nut trick wouldn't work) but because it's too short.
Apparently the 2.0 and 1.7 heads expect different sized exhaust mounting
ears? Seems that way, and Troy's J tubes did look to have shorter ears than
my HEs. I think my 1.7's were flycut for the 2.0 P&amp;C's. It would make sense
based on what I've seen...
