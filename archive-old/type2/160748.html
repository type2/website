Subject: Re: [T2] clutch pedal question

Holy shabizzle, Mike!!!

I used to live in Redwood Shores back when I worked at Excite_at_Home  
and can NOT imagine having to do that trip by speed shifting.

The trip is bad enough with a perfectly functioning vehicle.

Hills and curves and traffic, OH MY!

Double-holy shabizzle.

&gt; All this talk of cables breaking reminds me of when my clutch broke  
&gt; and I had to speedshift all the way back to my parents house in  
&gt; Redwood city from north of SF!  That was not the most pleasant  
&gt; experience, especially going through the TOLL BOOTH!!!
