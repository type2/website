Subject: heater box bellows needed

Bus folks,
There's a hint of fall in the air that has brought about memories of cold
extremities last winter in the '68 crewcab.  The PO used what looks like
some flexible exhaust pipe to connect between the heater boxes and body
heater tubes.  This solution is noisy and the tubes don't seal very well.  I
called BusBoys for the replacement plastic bellows-type connectors and Bill
said they don't have them.  He said that they are a couple inches longer
than the bug connectors and he doesn't know of anyone who has them.  RMMW
doesn't list them in their catalog, but I haven't called them yet.

Are these really scarce?  Should I expect it to be a dealer only item?
Anybody have any other recommended sources?

Thanks,
Dean
