Subject: RE: '77 tranny?

&gt;From: &quot;Will Anderson&quot;


&gt;I have a '76-'79
&gt;091 trans in my 70 Westy and love it.  The higher gearing gives much better
&gt;cruising speed at mid RPMs.  This is with a hopped up Type1 1776 engine.
&gt;I had to change my nose cone and bellhousing.

Bell housing because of the Type I engine? Nose cone to fit the bus? I think 
that sounds right and makes sense to me.


&gt;I think??? that the '77 nose
&gt;cone should be compatible with a '73, but I could be wrong here.  The ONLY
&gt;difference in my nose cone externally was the way the front tranny mounts
&gt;hook up differently on a '70--check to see, '73 might work with a '77, I am
&gt;guessing that it would but you need to confirm.

I hoping that someone on the list can help me with this. I am just getting 
into buses.

&gt;However, I have heard many horror stories of FLYWHEEL incompatibility with
&gt;the mid-to later trannies.  Focus on keeping the
&gt;bellhousing-flywheel-starter combo the same to match whatever engine you 
&gt;are
&gt;using, and I think you should be in good shape!  Best thing would be to 
&gt;swap
&gt;the entire '77 setup at the same time.

The deal I am looking at is the tranny engine and starter. Basically 
everything from the tip of the nose cone to the exhaust pipe. I just wanted 
to know before I invest somebody's money into the bus for them without 
knowing the full situation at hand.

Thanks,
