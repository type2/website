In a message dated 99-05-14 09:09:46 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; people drive 55 mph through school zones when the posted limit is 25 and 
 kids are out on the sidewalks with bookbags on their backs. So what do 
 you do? Go 55? Or slow down and feel like an idiot?
  &gt;&gt;
I am not clear on one thing, why would you feel like an idiot for obeying the 
law? Who is making you feel like an idiot, the f*cking a**hole speeding by at 
55 MPH? You touched on something that gets me very angry(speeding in a school 
zone)  I know this was'nt the original intent of your post, but you comment 
struck me as odd- if I am doing what I know is right, NO ONE is going to make 
me feel like an idiot. Personally, I feel anyone doing 55 in an active school 
zone should be dragged from their car and beaten.        Jeff S.
