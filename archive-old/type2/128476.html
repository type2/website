Subject: Re: [T2] engine problems

It would be my opinion you should get out the Bentley book and study how to strip the cooling off the engine. Then start looking for your leak. It's not hard. So many things to leak - seals on the crank and oil cooler, push rod tubes, dipstick boot, etc. etc. That wobbling fan might be the first place to look. I'd remove it and reinstall it. Maybe it got tightened too much on one side and though the hardware is tight, it is not fully seated on the crank. If this be the case, might as well replace the seal. I'd bet money it is trashed. Also look carefully at the hub - is it scarred up? If it is the fan, then you've answered your own question. Congrats. If not the fan, then at least you've corrected something the mechanic should not have missed! 

Not particularly fun to tear the cooling off but not too hard either. You'll needs some basic tools and some wheels for a couple days because it'll take 1 day to take it apart (prob if your a newbie) and a few days to put it back together if you are a cleaner and a painter like me.
