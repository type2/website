&gt; Did you see the price of the VW Engines they sell for airboat use? Like,

I understand that they do some mods for increased thrust, which would be a
great concern for airboat use.  They develop much greater thrust loads
than automotive or aircraft applications.

Besides, the alternative engines for airboat use are Lycoming or
Continental aircraft engines.  The smallest rebuilt Lycoming goes for over
$15,000.  Against this background, $5000 is dirt cheap :)
