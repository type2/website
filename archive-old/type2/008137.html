Hi All,

There is a procedure to test the FI temp sensor that is built into
the Air Flow Meter (AFM), by using an ohm meter on pins 27 &amp; 6.  It is
supposed to be under 2500 ohms at room temperature.

I have two AFM's that both read about 3500 ohms.  Which makes me think they
are bad :-( and I have to get a rebuilt one since the AFM temp sensor is not
&quot;user serviceable&quot;.

But, I put one in the freezer and tested 26000 ohms, then heated it by putting it
on top of the toaster oven ;-) and got 900 ohms.. which makes me think that the
sensor isn't stuck.

Question:  Is it possible for the temp sensor to be bad and still give me the
range of 900 ohms to 26000 ohms.  Has anyone else tested their AFM Temp sensor
and got the factory specs?

thanks
