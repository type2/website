&gt; Hi Volks,

&gt; The cold weather has finally bitten into Toronto, and it'll soon be time to
&gt; put the bus away for the winter, before snow and road salt can put their
&gt; mark on it.
&gt;
&gt; Unfortunately, the garage I parked the bus in last winter is NLA.
&gt; I've considered storing the bus in the single-car garage in my townhouse;
&gt; but the new garage door that was installed last week has reduced the ceiling
&gt; clearance to 73&quot;, whereas my Westfakia measures in at 76&quot; in height.
&gt;
&gt; The suddenly I'm reminded of an Audi Quattro commercial I saw a few years
&gt; back.
&gt;
&gt; I have some spare rims that don't have tires on them, and a bus without
&gt; tires on would have sufficient clearance to squeeze in under the new door.
&gt;
&gt; Is this going to damage permanently damage the rims?

I doubt it!  We just had a police chase down in LA where the car went over
a spike strip and then proceeded for _3_ hours and dozens of miles on the
rims!  Rolling your bus into the garage on them probably won't even
scratch them!
