Brian,

No, that sounds right (altho it also sounds like an aftermarket
improvement).  the VW O2 sensors were all, AFAIK, one wire.  The reason
for using coax is that the exterior braided conductor provides a shield
from &quot;noise&quot; that the rest of the engine generates, especially the spark
plugs. The voltage generated by the O2 sensor is very small and can be
affected by the static being generated by other devices in the engine
comparment.  That exterior wrap should be attached to a ground somewhere
for the mod to be effective.
