Subject: Re: [T2] wiring on a VDO 50-150 Cel. oil temp gauge??

One wire goes to hot, one goes to sender, and one is ground.  They should be
marked on the back of it near the terminals.  If you got the ground, a quick
swap of the wires one way and then the other gives you the right way without
damaging anything.
