Subject: Re: [T2] type 1 into a 73

Check the glad nut on the motor and make sure the pilot bearing is 
not shredded and blocking the input shaft. You may have to trim the 
input shaft. There has been talk of this needing to be done because 
the input shaft is a bit longer. Alternately you could swap input 
shafts from the 71 bus.

Good luck
