&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt;     I'm going to be visiting relatives in the Denver area and was 
&gt; wondering
&gt; if there will be any VUU (veedoubleyou) events in that area between June
&gt; 28th and July10th.  Shows, campouts, I don't care, because I'm sure the 
&gt; VUU
&gt; crowd out there is just as good as the folks here on the east coast.
