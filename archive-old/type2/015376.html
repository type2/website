&gt;Hey Everyone!
&gt;
&gt;I have a '70 westy that needs a new steering box.  My mechanic checked his
&gt;sources &amp; found they are no longer carrying them because the ones they used
&gt;to do were TRW rebuilt boxes and apparently peices of cr*p.
&gt;
&gt;Not wanting to put cr*p in my bus, I thought I would defer to the list to
&gt;see if anyone can recommend a good source for these!

Dave, in Longview, WA is a place called Averr's. They been parting Type
II's for many years and they know the difference between a worn box and a
usable one. I don't recall ever having a problem with the parts I have
gotten from them through the years. I'm not at the shop so I don't have the
number right hear handy, but any Y-pages search will find them. Ask them to
send you their Type I magnet with their info. Tell them Doktor Tim sent you.

Campbell-Nelson in Lynnwood, WA has both used and new VW parts departments.
They have a coupla acres of chassis of euro variety including VW parts and
typically DO NOT send out junk. Good source for Porsche and Saab used parts
as well.

Both are knowledgable and I recommend them for the good parts and services
they have provided me and my clients in the past.
