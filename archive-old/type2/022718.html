&gt;&gt; JWB, posted  a link to a pic of the a Dutch produced mouse pad with lotsa
cool logo'd buses on it. What would it take to get some of those imported?
Could we do a group purchase to save on shipping? Any dutch listmembers
interested in lending a hand? &lt;&lt;

I don't know what y'all think about the ethics of this, but I have no
gut-wrenching problem with it, since it would be for my own use.  If you
save the image to your hard drive, you can then use it to make your own
mouse pad (or anything else) at iPrint_dot_com.  Might be cheaper than paying to
have it shipped over-seas.
