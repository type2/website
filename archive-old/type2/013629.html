Hey, everybody!
Do you have to remove all of the cabinets and the
bench in order to remove the linoleum and ply wood?
If so, how do you go about removing the drain to the
sink and the vent pipe leading to the ceiling?
                             Thanks,
                             Paul Deatherage

&gt; can I expect to

&gt; 
&gt; I just stripped out my '72 Westy.  I haven't posted
&gt; the pics yet, but I
&gt; can tell you what I found.
&gt; 
&gt; It's real easy to pull the cabinets.  Just do it in
&gt; the logical order.
