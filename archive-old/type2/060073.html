     Hi List:
                   Got the CVs done on the 73 Westy yesterday. The fluid
that was dripping out of the inboard torn cv boot was very old grease!
Cleaned and repacked and reinstalled the axel. Hope to test drive tommorow.
                   My Dad who is part owner of the Westy has the above
mentioned gas heater
and is looking for a new ,used or other fuel pump that will work with it.
Anyone have or know where one is available?

      Thanks All,
Phil
