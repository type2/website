Greetings everyone,

&gt;From the October 1998 issue of Classic Cars
page 179 quarter page ad....

BEETLES (UK) LTD
&quot;Keeping the legend alive&quot;

NEW 1998 &quot;TYPE 2'S&quot;
1.6 Fuel injection
Air cooled Vans, Campers, and Seven Seat Buses
from 9495 pounds ($15,467.36 in USA dollars as best I can figure) + VAT
2 pictures: All white van and all white seven seater.... newer vanagonish  
hubcaps, otherwise you'd bet the images were taken straight out of a mid 70's 
bus brochure. Grill between the signal lights is black and the VW logo looks 
smaller and is also painted black.

&quot;The New Beetle&quot;
1.6 injection, classis shape
Left ot Right Hand Drive
Agents Nationwide
from 7,995 pounds ($13,023.86 in USA dollars as best I can figure)
look like stock Brazilian bugs to me, signals in the bumpers, etc.

Rangeworthy, Nr. Bristol, South
Gloucestershire BS37 7LP
&quot;viewing by appointment only&quot;
(01454) 228 999

also on page 114 is an article with photo
&quot;The other VW camper&quot;....
a vehicle labeled &quot;Bugoroo&quot; front half up to the windshield is a bug, from 
there on back as best can be described as the rear of a Winnabego.
&quot;Camper features a dining and lounge area and a well equiped kitchen in the 
rear.&quot;
&quot;It is for sale, call Steve Mason at California Connections on 01335 300312.&quot;
this mutation has wide tires but still looks like it would skip over a lane 
or so with a 10mph crosswind. Windshield is a flat vertical pane of glass. 
Aerodynamically it makes my '71 Westy seem like a Delorean....

Next time you're by a magazine rack take a look at Classic Cars magazine.... 
the articles are really interesting, a whole section on &quot;Buried treasures&quot; 
which features found heaps, relics, and other piles of rusted metal which 
other people like us equate with restorable gems.....

Greg
