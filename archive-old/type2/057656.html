...switch to decaf today, steve?...  :p

Fitting a T*yota dash panel to a Westy.... you would basically have to
stick with all of the senders that go with the Toyota gauges, putting
those senders back on the engine and so on.... It would be a *lot* of
work. Even though T*yota gauges and dash panels are world-famous for
their longevity... they are better left on T*yotas... too much to change
over, and the aesthetic value of the bus gets hurt by vigorous chopping.
