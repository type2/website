Subject: Flight VW 2006 - June 4th - Camping is allowed the night before
  - Come join us!!

Just a note that our local VW club is having a show on June 4th, 2006 in
Bealeton, VA. It is a combination show with the local Flying Circus. Their
will be open cockpit planes rides. It is not a big show, but we would love to
have some more busses show up. For more info, check this link.

Their is camping allowed the night before with paid admission to the event.
Reservations requested. I myself will probably not be camping, but the
president of our club and other members will be there all day and night
Saturday. It is not a campground, pretty much a big field as far as I know,
but their will be portable toilets available. Should be a blast for all the
attend.

Even if you cannot camp, please come out and help us take this show to the
next level. We would really like to get more cars in the show!!

Corbett
