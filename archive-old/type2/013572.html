Sounds like an idea worth looking into.
After many visits to auto wrecking yards I've never seen them sell an
engine access hatch so they should be cheap.
I'll bet you could forego the welding and just cut the perimeter frame
from the donor and pop rivet it in place with some good double sided
insulating tape for a seal. Then drop your hatch cover down.

I've been working through the big hatch on an 83 Westfalia for seven
years and have installed heads and cylinders with the engine in the car
(Oh! my aching back.).

If you make this retrofit you'll love it.

&gt; &gt; feasible to cut one from a later model bus and weld it into my

&gt; &gt; anyone ever done this?

&gt; Jim:
&gt; VW didn't think you needed one, why should you? Seriously, sounds 
&gt; like a good
&gt; idea,  but why stop there? I'd cut it out of a Vanagon, an early one 
&gt; with the
&gt; steel hatch lid, and really have the room. Several years of working 
&gt; on
&gt; Vanagons have spoiled me!
