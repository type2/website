&gt; I'm wondering where the -23fs^-2 (rate of acceleration) came from &amp;

Well, it can be a constant, if the driver modulates the brake pedal to
maintain a constant decel.  I worked at the GM desert proving grounds and
we used to do this all the time, watching a &quot;decelerometer&quot; stuck to the
windshield to keep us honest.

&gt; &gt; Did the ppl doing this have a tape measure &amp; accelerometer, but left
&gt; the stopwatch at home??

I'm willing to bet that they used the distance and initial speed to get
all the numbers, assuming constant deceleration.  That's why the numbers
work together so well!  The differences in the quadratic roots are
probably due to rounding errors in the input numbers.
