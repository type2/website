Subject: RE: [T2] VDO Gauge Pod

&gt;Put the speedo in the glove box per some Brit vintage sports cars (to 
&gt;scare
&gt;or impress the passenger) and put the instruments for temps and volts and 
&gt;pressures in front of you. Oh and a tach too.

This is a great idea, but with the speed of the &quot;loaf&quot; I really doubt that
having the speedometer in the glove box would either impress or scare the
passenger.  It, most likely, would make them chuckle a little.
