I seem to recall reading the same thing that Mike did about the 10 degrees
cooler (it may have been a Bob Hoover sermon). It did specify that it was
flat black paint, however. As for the the hot pink suggestion, I've had good
results with various animal print patterns painted on my engine parts with
the tin painted up like jungle shrubbery.
Have fun,

&gt; I hope Mick is happy that he is at least getting SOME answers to his
&gt; question this time.
&gt;
&gt; I don't recall exactly what engine the on-line blurb I read was testing,
but
&gt; seem to remember that the black paint ran 10 degrees (oil) cooler than the
&gt; other colors tested. Mick'll havta go look for the write-up.
&gt;
&gt; If the color is NOT important on a particular engine, may I suggest a hot
&gt; pink, with alternating horizontal green, orange, and purple stripes. It
&gt; drives the girls crazzzy!
&gt;
&gt; I've over allocated my 2-cents worth on this one.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; However, the great majority of the heat transfer in a VW engine is via
&gt; &gt; forced convection, which is why we need that big fan and all those fins
&gt; &gt; on the engine.  Therefore, the whole &quot;What color to paint the engine&quot;
&gt; &gt; arguement might be moot.
