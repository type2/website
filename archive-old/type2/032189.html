Subject: Oil temp sender under pressure relief valve?
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.SOL.3.96.990328181533.4683A-100000_at_techsrv1.tech.mtu_dot_edu&gt;

I've seen a few references, both here and in the archives, to mounting an
oil temperature sender under the pressure relief valve.  I haven't,
however, seen any info on how this is done.  Also, not knowing exactly how
this valve works, is this a good place to measure temperature?  Is the oil
getting a fair amount of circulation, or is it mostly stagnant, being
under the piston of the valve?  I assume the sender is tapped into the
plug under the valve somehow, but I'm having trouble visualizing it.

Right now on my 2.0L I have a semiconductor temp sensor wired to a digital
display on the dash.  THe sender is glued way up inside the fins next to
the sump plate...I understand this reads crankcase temp, not oil temp, but
it's been surprisingly responsive for me, and it's better than flying
blind.  Anyway, I'm always looking for something more accurate that I can
easily install (and afford).  (Total outlay for the semiconductor
arrangement was about $25, including the digital display.)  I see lots of
inexpensive temp gauges, but the VW-specific ones are always rather
pricey.
