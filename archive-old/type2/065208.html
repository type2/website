Subject: Re: Engine removal ('74)

 Regarding transmission mounting in later busses- this is a mixed blessing-
in my 71 bus, after jacking up the rear to make climbing underneath easier,
I could lower engine AND trans until they were again parallel to floor,
then block up trans or cable it up.  This made it easy to yank out engine
without scraping the mounting studs, and to reach upper bolts in busses
without top access door; more importantly, it allowed easier insertion of
engine (lining up of trans shaft).  Could do it all myself with 2 scissors
jacks, a board underneath, and 3 broom handles!  In my 78 Westy, I was
annoyed that after jacking up bus, you need another person to tip/align
engine while operating the jack to keep it in line when removing because
trans stud is NOT parallel to ground.  Now it's better to let car down
around engine/jack to keep it in alignment for reinstalling  Sheesh...MB.
PS- anyone know if letting trans hang by axles/velocity joints really hurts
anything?  I think I've done that in a pinch....
