Subject: Pop top web site

Good Morning,
Anyone awake that would have the web address for  the pop top site?  There
is a page or two that has all the step by step instructions for removal.  I
have it on my PC at work, and I have not been successful as of yet finding
it in the archives.
Just hoping one of you fine folks have it handy.
