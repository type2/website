Subject: Re: [T2] Can't find timing any timing marks!

First, I'm assuming the timing scale - that black plastic thing with degree
marks - is in place behind the main cooling fan screen.  It is, right?

The timing mark on the pulley is on the FRONT side of the pulley - the side
that faces the engine - and is hardly worthy of the work &quot;mark.&quot;  If you'd
take the pulley off and hold it in your hand you'd find the &quot;mark&quot; is really
a very shallow line, kind of like someone took one stroke on the edge of the
pulley with a hacksaw.  Remove the cooling fan screen and timing scale and
start searching for the &quot;mark&quot; with a fingernail.  Since you've got the
engine running you should be able to hone in fairly closely as to where the
mark actually is.  Put a drop of paint on the mark so you can find it with
your timing light.

&gt;
&gt; So I make a static test light and go back outside
&gt; only to find not a single paint mark, scratch ,or notch,  or anything! I
just
&gt; played with the dizzy till it ran Okay. The dizzy is turned about 1/5 from
&gt; where it was before.
&gt;
&gt; Finally my question. HOW DO I PROPERLY TIME MY ENGINE WITH ABSOLUTELY NO
&gt; TIMING MARKS WHATSOEVER!  Only my dizzy tells me where #1 is firing. I do
have
&gt; my dwell set at exactly 50 degrees with the engine running now. If
somebody
&gt; could point me to 7.5 BTDC, my Bus,Wife and I will be very grateful. Thank
you
&gt; to all that respond.
