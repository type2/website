Subject: RE: [T2] re:dumb CDI question

Point of clarification here:

Compufire, Petronix, and other points replacement devices are just that
devices that replace your points. The points, or compufire, or petronix,
etc., are simply trigger mechanisms (that fit inside the distributor)
for the part of your ignition system that is actually producing the
spark. What produces the spark could be a standard voltage coil or a
high voltage coil. CDI stands for capacitive discharge ignition. It
works with your coil. As the name implies it has capacitors that store
electricity. When the trigger mechanism in the distributor (see above)
&quot;calls&quot; for the spark to occur the CDI dumps its stored electricity
through the coil. Instead of your coil receiving 12 volts of primary
power, it receives several hundred volts. This generates several
thousand or tens of thousands of secondary voltage to the spark plug.
And the CDI may dump this voltage through the coil several times, giving
the fuel mixture more than one opportunity to ignite and drive the
piston. This is called a MSD CDI (multi-spark discharge capacitive
discharge ignition)

 Just out of curiosity? What kind of CDI? Points or Compufire type?

Thanks.
