Hey. My bus is a '72 with dual carbs. It isn't a very good looking bus. 
A few small dents and some rust. There is a larger dent on the front 
end. The engine runs but there is constant backfire and it dies.
I don't really know much about buses. You could probably get it
running fine. The interior is in decent shape. All original campmobile 
interior. Seats, bed in good shape. Sink doesn't pump. I don't know what 
to do with it, so I'm trying to sell it to somebody who will be able to 
use it. Like I said it doesn't look great and isn't drivable right now, 
but with a little work I think it would be a good camper.
I know it was fun to use it when it was running. Thanks.
                                                          Simon
