Subject: Re: [T2] exhaust inside the bus

All of the VW's with exhaust leaks I have worked on were related to cracked or rusted heater boxes leaking into the heated air and being pushed into the heating system. All of these VW's had heater systems that leaked a bit of heated air into the car even if the controls were off. 

Have you tried blocking off the heater system (disconnecting the heater tubes between the engine and body?). 

Also can you move your CO detector and get higher readings near any of the heater outlets? 

Chris
