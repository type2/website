Subject: Westy bed...

I have a stack of the Z-beds top and bottom (4 to 5 of 'em plus extra Z
hinges etc in various conditions), out of the splittie buses (w/o the big ol
pad). After I get finished with the RFH, I plan on simply taking them to a
swap and getting what I can out of them. I think that they wiil be as
valuable as boat anchors. The anchor might bring more at a boat show. I
could never imagine shippin one of them! good luck...
