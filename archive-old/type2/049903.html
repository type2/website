Subject: [T2] Re:Seat heaters &amp; Alternators

Looking _at_ the seat heater posts reminded me of my Mini days (you Yanks would
not believe!). I was quite common to swap alternators from other models &amp;
even makes of car. However we are not that fortunate with alternators
running the fan also, BUT another trick was to get the alternator rebuilt _at_
a higher rating (up to 120 amps!) now this does not harm any components as
there is no additional voltage. The only down side was cost (about 50% more
to rebuild) &amp; the fact that I was understood that the alternator would fail
sooner, however I used 3 &amp; none of them failed under long distance or race
conditions (track, autocross &amp; rally) so that a small consideration. Just my
2p's worth!
