Subject: crank shaft swap?

hello,
i was wondering if the crank shaft from a 1.8L non hydralic lifter
engine, would fit into a 2.0L hydralic engine. i would need to know for
certain because if i do it and it doesn't work i'm sure i would
completely ruin the engine. i don't mean to be rude but please make sure
any info you tell me is accurate.

thanks :-) wade
