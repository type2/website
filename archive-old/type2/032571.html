Seth, and All;

First off, was anyone injured?  I'll get flamed big-time for saying this, I 
suppose, but there isn't a Type 2 in the entire universe that's worth a human 
life.

That said, it would be instructive and enlightening to know the circumstances 
and results of the incident that &quot;terminally damaged&quot; your bus.

A member of our extended family was recently injured in an accident involving 
his transporter.  The effects of the collision on his bus, and the bus's 
occupants, were unusual and unexpected.

On Monday my beloved bus was terminally damaged on the
way home from a vacation and is now a parts donor. I
can't stand being busless and have begun looking for
another one. I am looking for a driver in good
condition and can travel for the right one. Any year
considered. Please p-mail me with any leads.

TIA,
Seth
