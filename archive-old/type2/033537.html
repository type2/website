Subject: Wacky Idea (temp. sensor modification)

An idea for controlling head temps, and maybe even making the cockpit of
those gauge-encrusted buses a little more like the airplanes they aspire to
be...

I've heard a few tales of people wiring a resistor in series with Temp
Sensor #2 (in L-Jet FI buses) to slightly alter their fuel mixture when
going to a larger displacement.

Now, with that in mind, wouldn't it be possible to wire a rheostat in there
instead, so the running mixture could be adjusted by the operator? 
Furthermore, couldn't you put that rheostat on the dashboard, and adjust the
mixture while the bus is in motion?

The first problem, of course, is that with a resistor in series, you can
only reduce total resistance ( = richer mixture, I believe?), not increase
said resistance.  The solution, of course, is to put a fixed-value resistor
in series with the temp. sensor, and then the variable one in parallel with
the two of them.

Now, the utility of something like this is immediately suspect, since
twiddling that knob could seriously damage one's engine.  It would probably
be prudent to use a SPDT relay back in the engine compartment, combined with
a switch on the dash, to turn this circuit on and off.  That way one could
trust the computer most of the time, and only go second-guessing it when it
might somehow be useful...

Secondly, you'd want a good CHT or two on the dash, to monitor the
temperature in there (or, perhaps even an EGT (Exhaust Gas Temperature)
gauge if you want to get really airplane-like), and an EGO (Exhaust Gas
Oxygen) gauge attached to an O2 sensor in the tailpipe to monitor what the
mixture's actually like.

The advantage to all of this, of course, is when you're driving up that
mountain pass with your fully-loaded westy in the nice thin air (remember,
there's no altitude compensator on the average FI bus), and the heads start
to bake, you could flip the switch on the dash and enrichen the fuel
mixture, at once cooling the heads and slightly increasing the available HP. 
Kinda like a little do-it-yourself engine management.

Now, is this idea somehow fundamentally flawed, or just blisteringly stupid
in some way that I haven't yet realized?

Thanks for any input...  :)
