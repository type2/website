&gt;Mark Stephens sure promotes his engines as I am sure everyone
&gt;probably does.  I do like the idea of the 100000 miles head warranty. 
&gt;Has anyone had experiences with Mark Stephens rebuilt engines.  they
&gt;are 300 more than GEX  but seem to have a better warranty.  

Have had horrible experiences with GEX.  Have been very happy with AVP 
(1-800-548-5766).
