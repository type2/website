Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Trailer Hitch?

Hi Blake

I have a couple of Hitches available, you can see the 74 Vw Bus style here
http://www.globalserve_dot_net/~jrivers/hitch.htm

There is a receiver style available that will accept a 1 1/4&quot; or a 2&quot; receiver
,for any standard size ball, bicycle carrier, or what ever,,  I don't have
pictures yet
You know the type that the tongue is removable with a pin and the bike rack is
inserted,,,

they both mount on the Vw the same,, right to the frame, *above* the bumper,,
you unbolt the bumper, install the hitch and rebolt the bumper and the hitch as
a sandwich,, 
you do NOT have to modify the bumper at all,
this is a very strong style of hitch and does not interfere with the muffler
replacement 
Black outdoor powder painted

They are u.s. $120 ea. + $30 shipping UPS  2-6 weeks delivery depending. 
the receiver style are u.s. $140 + same shipping 
I take paypal, CANADIAN postal order, cheque ,, 

I am not a business, I wait for the cheque to clear the bank before shipping 
They will be shipped from Southern Ontario CANADA

&gt; I have some photos of one, so I know it can be made.  I have a friend who
&gt; owns one, but the idiot welders around here refuse to duplicate it for me.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone have one to sell, or know of a place that will make one?
