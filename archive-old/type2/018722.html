Hi All, 

Hope everyone had a great 4th of July weekend !

I'm particularly grateful for the most recent threads on FI
troubleshooting. Last weekend, I finally pulled the engine on my '78
standard. I bought this bus about two years ago with a bad transmission
but a great engine and many new parts. The PO was anal about maintenance
and had recently replaced cv's, clutch, brakes, etc. Charlie Ford drove
it home for me at breakneck speed and said it pulled stronger than the
Mothership.

I was apprehensive about pulling the engine and fooling with the FI and
all that, so the bus has been taking up space in my shop. I would
periodically do some bodywork and have completed about 99% of that with
the idea of getting rid of the lime green color and transforming this
bus to a theme vehicle. She was christened &quot;Radio Flyer&quot; and will soon
receive a coat of Porsche Guard Red with the original white above and an
all new custom interior complete with &quot;radio flyer&quot; oak jailbars.

Happily, thanks to listee Russell Barr down in Centralia, (about three
hours south of Seattle) I finally acquired the requisite 091
transmission a few weeks ago, so now have no excuses.

I can report that one person, with patience and the right tools can
easily pull this monster of an engine. I hope that I can soon report
that one person (with the help of the list) can get it back together and
running. First, however, I borrowed the Sony digital from work and took
photos of everything. Then, as my work progressed, I took more photos. 
Saturday I began the engine dismantling, basically to a long block,
taking photos as I went. I ended Sunday with the engine dismantled and
detailed and mounds of engine parts, tin, wires, fuel injection stuff to
be detailed, sandblasted, repainted, replaced and reassembled. Since
digital photos are cheap and take only disk space, I plan to completely
document the reassembly, hoping I can get them up on a web site for
others to use. 

Along the way, I discovered that the engine is actually a GE ('79) case,
complete with the Hall sensor at the flywheel and that the EGR tube to
the nonexistent catalytic converter (or whatever had been down there)
had been cut just below the tin. This was probably due to the
installation of the aftermarket exhaust system, which I remember as
being pretty quiet.

Questions I have:

1. Will the engine or FI suffer because of the removal/alteration of the
catalytic converter or is this the equivalent of a heat riser ?
(assuming that the van had a catalytic converter). Can I simply
fabricate a plug(s) and leave this tube off ?

2. Are there any advantages to trying to find the proper coil and
distributor to utilize the Hall sensor and thus the breakerless ignition
system ? Or are other parts of the FI system unique to this system ?

3. I will replace all rubber, including the fuel lines, however I really
think the fuel ring is tacky. Is there any experience with replacing all
this with stainless braided fuel lines, especially since the ring must
maintain 35 lb. continuous pressure  ?

4. Am I wrong, or does the thermostat work opposite of the 1600 and
older engines ? It appears from the instructions in the Bentley that the
proper adjustment is to close the flaps, pull the actuating wire tight
and clamp down the nut. This would mean that we are relying on the
thermo to expand and open the flaps and if for some reason it did not,
the flaps would remain closed and thus possibly overheat the engine...am
I nuts here ?

5. I cannot find the Probst fuel injection book for Bosch systems. Does
anyone have an extra copy they would like to sell ? Please pmail me if
so. Dirty/used is the best !

6. The exhaust manifolds from the heads have lost the protective sleeve
which covered them. I recently thought I saw a thread about wrapping
these with a asbestos type material, but could not find the thread in
archives. Anybody know about this stuff ?

I am particularly anxious to put up photos of re-assembly, particularly
of the FI system. Are there other web sites showing this material; am I
being redundant ?

Thanks to a three day weekend, I am now off to the shop for an exciting
afternoon of sandblasting, welding heater boxes, maybe some painting,
etc....

Many thanks...
