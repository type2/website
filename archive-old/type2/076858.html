Subject: Jim Thompson Health Update

Thought it might me appropriate to pass along the info that Jim Thompson of
http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com suffered a pretty serious heart attack
yesterday on the evening of the 30th.  An angioplasty and two &quot;stints&quot; were
fittted to open what's called a &quot;centraflex&quot; artery connected to the heart.
 At last report, Jim was doing well in the hospital (I think it's called
Community Memorial of Ventura) and looks to be back out on Saturday or
Sunday, but the doctors are looking at an another artery that appears to be
partially plugged and may do some work on it right away if Jim's overall
health can take the procedure, otherwise it may be done a few weeks from
now when he's got some better strength.  Jim said tonight that he feels
pretty good compared to 24 hours earlier.

Jim suffered two mild attacks in June and November of 2000 as well.  I'm
sure he would appreciate hearing from people at his personal email:
