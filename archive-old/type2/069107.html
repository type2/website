Subject: '73 with 2bbl Weber?

My friend is about to obtain a '73 Westy with the stock 1700
and a single 2bbl carb in place of the duals (CO sez they were 
problematic at best).

Engine seems to run strong with this setup, but takes a while 
to warm up.  We are just wondering about long-term reliability
of this setup and any steps that some garage genius out there
has come up with to find a way to preheat this carb.

This is a great bus otherwise, very complete, little rust, one
owner the past 15 yrs.  Also, I'm not that familiar with the 
T4 motor, are there any warning signs or red flags to look for
besides low compression, etc?

TIA,

Blake
