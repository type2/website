Subject: Re: [T2] Re: HVLP Turbine Paint Sprayer on Sale

I saw the ad as it was handed to me by a HF employee
upon approaching the big tent they had in the parking
lot. The checker was not at all interested in selling
me anything, but oneof the guys went in back and
brought a few out. $29.98 is what I paid. Plus almost
9% Wasington State sales tax, that is. I used to have
to drive an hour.5 to my sister's to go to HF or at
least an hour to go to the closest one but it was not
in an area I care to go to... Then they put one in the
town next door - about an hour.5 (that's an hour and a
half to you non-thinking readers) away because of
traffic - but only ten minutes away this afternoon!
They are putting another one in Bellevue which is
where I work and I drive right past it every day for
lunch. This may not be a good thing! -BaH

 Where did you see the ad? I am fortunate to have a
 HF about 3 miles from me,
 saves on shipping small stuff! And I want this
 sprayer....
