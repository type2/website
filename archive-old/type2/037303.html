valve cooling thru the guide is insignificant compared to what happens
between the valve and seat.

&gt; I wouldn't either.
&gt; As far as i have been able to deduce, wear in valve guides mill mainly
affect
&gt; the cooling of the valve itself; the more distance between the guide and
the
&gt; valve, the less heat transfer between the guide and the valve, hotter
valve=
&gt; shorter valve life.
&gt;
&gt; As the guide wears, you would probably start burning a little oil and
&gt; eventually the valve loses its head.
&gt;
&gt; I really don't se a direct line of causation between p-rod seal leaking
and
&gt; valve guide wear, nor do i see a relation between comoression and valve
&gt; guides.

&gt; &gt;      Would you pull the heads with only 29,700 miles on the engine?  I
&gt; &gt; rebuilt this engine for the PO in 1996.  I used all new or rebuilt
parts.
&gt; I
&gt; &gt; thought it had 35,000 on it but when I checked the reciepts it has only
&gt; &gt; 29,700.  As far as the heads go, I would not pull the tin to re-torque
the
&gt; &gt; top bolts unless the bottoms were more then a couple of pounds out with
a
&gt; &gt; clicker torque wrench.  The oil drip out of the pushrod tubes is less
then
&gt; 1
&gt; &gt; quart in 2000 miles.  It is a very tiny drip.
