&gt; &gt;Home depot no longer sells it because of liability concerns.
&gt; &gt;got my most recent purchase from a brickyard and building supply wholesale
&gt; &gt;house
&gt;
&gt; I wonder if this is a state regulation of legal or if they are slowly phasing it out? I saw it just last weekend.

think their phasing it out as the manager told me that he just sold off
his stock but can't get it anymore.

&gt; Even so, 2 gallon of this stuff is way too much so I've been buying quart sized bottles from OSH. The fumes from this acid will rust your chinese tools overnight so keep that in mind when you are working with it in the garage.

heck yeah, I've had a gallon here forever and I'm doing brickwork too.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;it works but it is nasty stuff, bakeing soda is not a true neutralizer,
&gt; &gt;only lot and lots and lots of water will truely make it safe. make sure a
&gt; &gt;working garden hose is at hand.
&gt;
&gt; I forgot to mention I added water and baking soda before I started
&gt; scrubbing.
&gt;
&gt; Nothing cleans rusted metal at this price like muratic acid. I've used
&gt; it on battery trays, gas tanks, seat frames. I've even used it to clean
&gt; electrical contacts. Once the surface is truly clean, you can use a
&gt; phosphoric acid solution to etch the metal before priming/painting.

right there, it does the job but not stuff for the meek of heart (which
doesn't describe many VW owners)

&gt; It's no fun to use and dispose but I works so well I'll continue to rely
&gt; on it until something better comes along.

same here...

as they say, be safe folks

Bob
