Subject: Re: [T2] compression low

&gt; &gt;I'll try to make it quick: replaced both heads in July.
&gt;
&gt; Replaced them with what, exactly?

Two rebuilt heads from AVP in Sacto.

&gt; &gt;After the rebuild,.....
&gt;
&gt; What was done in this &quot;rebuild,&quot; and by whom?

Main reason for rebuild: #3 exhaust valve toast.  Compression then was
about 110/110/0/110.  I did the rebuild (well, with help from the list),
top end only.  Kept the p's &amp; c's, since they were still in spec (borrowed
a micrometer to test tolerances as per Bentley).  Used new Grant rings.
Did the whole honing bit.  Cleaned all the nasty carbon off those p's &amp;
c's.  Did lots of other ancillary stuff, not related to the engine (fuel
lines, clutch...)

I ended up taking the bus to a shop _twice_ to work out gremlins (which
still seem to be lingering).  Two problems initially: one hyd lifter had
come apart, result was lower compression (roughly 100/100/90/100).  Also,
distributor was replaced, since the advance wasn't working.  Second trip
to the shop was chasing down vacuum bugaboos (which I believe still isn't
quite resolved, though vac was 16&quot; at last check).

&gt; &gt;.....the compression was about 130psi all the way around (after a bit of
&gt; &gt;tinkering).  Now, ~250 miles later, the compression readings look like:
&gt; &gt;65/80/50/75.
&gt;
&gt; With the same compression tester?  Are you sure the O-ring on the tester is
&gt; sealing properly?
&gt; Is your battery fully charged, and all spark plugs removed?

Same compression tester, same way I've always tested, all plugs removed.
The test was done after driving for a few miles to warm up the engine.
Battery is relatively new, charged, and the starter is cranking just
fine.  Valves are adjusted as per Bently: 0 clearance, then 2 full turns.
One good thing to note: valve clatter that haunted me in the past has gone
away and the engine sounds relatively quiet.

&gt; &gt;  Yikes!  I forgot to try the &quot;squirt some oil in&quot; trick
&gt; &gt;(though I'm not sure what it would mean if this affected anything).
&gt;
&gt; It would mean that the piston rings are leaking, not the valves.
&gt;
&gt; A leak down test is much more informative than a compression test.
&gt; The device costs around $50, and you must have some source of compressed
&gt; air--though high volumes are not required.

I've already spent so much bread on tools and parts and trips to the
shop... Sigh...

&gt; &gt;The engine has been running hot if I take it on any trip over, say, 15-20
&gt; &gt;miles (oil temp typ 230deg+).  Thus, all driving has been short trips of 5
&gt; &gt;miles or so.
&gt;
&gt; Is this an accurate reading? (have you calibrated it with a known correct
&gt; lab thermometer--about $4 ?)  Is your cooling system (including all tinware
&gt; and seals) all present and installed correctly?

When I installed the gauge a few years ago, I did the boiling water test
and it was right on.  The bus never used to overheat, unless the temp
outside was sweltering and I was driving in the desert.  Now, temps around
here are pretty cool.  The bus seems to heat up more driving at low
speeds as opposed to highway speeds.  All the tin is in place, and as far
as I can tell is installed properly.  It is getting so hot that the
rubber spark plug seals are all melted and shriveled.

&gt; &gt;Have I totaled my engine?
&gt;
&gt; You will if you keep running it way too hot.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Should I first try retorquing the heads?
&gt;
&gt; It sure wouldn't hurt any.  I'd retorque the case while I was at it.

Case was never split, this was a top end rebuild only.  Problem these days
is I recently threw out my back, so it is hard to get down on the ground
to do stuff like this.  I'm also finding less time to do work due to
family obligations...

Where do I go from here?  Should I just have a shop do a leakdown test?
Am I looking at _another_ rebuild?  If so, anyone want to buy a bus?  :^(
