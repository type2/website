[...] The 311 part is listed as a Suppressor Choke for the wiper motor on a
'68 and later Type 3.  From the other descriptions given on the list I'd say
that it prevents the motor noise from coming through on your radio.  The
second part having 035 in the middle set of numbers indicates that it is a
VW accessory part.  Again, the descriptions already given describe its
usage.

&gt; 
&gt; Hey Everyone,
&gt;     I found these parts on my stash the other day.  They were in a NOS box
&gt; with the part number 211 035 657 A  and the word &quot;ENTSTORSATZ&quot;.  I figured
&gt; there were type2 parts inside.  I look inside to find two black boxes,
&gt; some kind of electrical items I've never seen before.  They are both
&gt; unused.  The part numbers are 311 955 203  and 111 035 267 A
