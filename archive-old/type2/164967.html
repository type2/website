Subject: Re: [T2] Junkyard Sadness

Spending money on cars is not an investment, you had better do it because you love it, you will never get it back in cash, only in miles.
My bus has had more than double spent on it than what I paid for it, but it is still only worth about what I paid for it, maybe a little more, but not 3 times as much, but I don't care, while I have spent $4000.00 on my bus my mom has spent $9900.00 in car payments on her F250 at $550.00 a month.
I have always had trouble buying parts that I can't take with me, like paint jobs and body repair.
