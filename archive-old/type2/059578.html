Subject: Gas guage sender - gas tank removal 

Guys, 

I thought I had posted this before, and I got all sorts of deja vu while I
was typing it, but a search of the archives reveals it not, so... To get
the gas tank out enough to replace the sender does not require much on a
late T4 engine bus.  Do the following: 

Drain gas tank;
remove hoses,
remove the screws from the bottom of the cover plate (a bugger!)
remove shift rod from the front of the tranny
remove bolts at the top of the bell housing (see bentley for details)
remove air filter, AFM and big hose
unplug double relay
remove screws from cover plate
pop out side cover and disconnect fill tube
place 2x12 on jack, support rear of engine wiht jack and 2x12
undo bolts holding rear hanger bar
lower rear of engine 
remove cover plate
remove tank holddown nuts
remove tank

to get the tank out, you need go no further with engine removal, leave the
front of the tranny and the axles alone, just swing the back of the engine
down.  Sure, cutting the hole is VW-approved, but it results in an *ugly*
hole and the covers I have seen give me little comfort about fire-safety.
While yer in there you can also replace all the short lengths of hose on
the vent lines!  I am also told that there is barely enough room to remove
the tank if you remove the intake manifold, but I think that dropping the
rear of the engine is easier.  It only needs to come down 6 inches!

One further warning - the taps on the tank *may* be rusty!  It may be a
good idea to have someone under the bus steering them thru their hole as
you joggle the tank out!
