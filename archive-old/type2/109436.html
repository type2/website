&gt;
&gt; I was maily looking for the specs. I want to put one in my bus with a
little
&gt; more umpf than stock, just a little.
&gt;


This got me interested so I just checked to make shure this was the correct
manual. It is. It is made by Phillips,
model PC-151-MR-2. It is &quot;designed to handle a maximum continuous 12 volt DC
demand (load) of 15 AMPS&quot;. As Karl stated it only runs the fridge and
charges the auxiliary battery when connected to shore power.
