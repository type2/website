Subject: Whats this 69 Delux Station Wagon worth?

I bought this bus several months ago for its engine, that
engine is now in my 68 Westy.  I drove it home.  Steering is
fair, breaks are good, and the lights work.  The body is
excellent, very, very little rust for Cleveland (except for
a gash, not due to rust, just aft of the driver door along
the bottom, about 18 inches).  Both bench seats are there,
along with a complete interior including both front
and rear floor rubber.

To get the engine out I had to remove the tranny with it.  The
driver side forward bumper nut has come loose in the frame member.

A very nice bus - just no engine or tranny.

Any ideas on a fair price?

For the Bus......
or
Bus + tranny

TIA
