Subject: RE: [T2] great door speaker location!!!

Im sure they have. As for the sound quality, you may as well put a 4x6
in the stock dash location, because I think it would sound better than
anything to place at foot level.

Has anyone mounted the speakers in the front kick plates with any
success?
