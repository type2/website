Subject: Re: [T2] Marvel Mystery Oil (was oil additive advise)

Just as an aside...

I took a marketing class many years ago and MMO was used as an example
of poor packaging.  Their red, black can was said to have 'devilish'
connotations. Said that in today's world, the Madison Ave types would
make the company repackage.

They must be doing something right, indeed.
