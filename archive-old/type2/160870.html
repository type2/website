Subject: Strange Ignition Issue

So here's a strange one for you.

Just installed the Hot Spark points replacement module in my SVDA.

Engine idles horribly unless I do something to put a drain on the
battery, like put it in reverse (reverse lights go on) or turn on the
headlights. Turn off the lights or take it out of reverse and she
idles terribly again. Hard to set the timing when she won't idle but
I've got it close. Also, yes I've got the red lead on the sensor unit
going to the + side of the coil and black to -.

Strange. Before I put the points back in any ideas?

Thanks
Jules
