Subject: Re: [T2] Cylinder to case sealant

hey guys   If I know how Jake is he will be using something that the rest of 
the world can't afford or find :)   I personally have been using permatex 
super 300 item # 8005 for the last 20 years with very good success . On certain 
places I use permatex  Right Stuff item # 29208 .   All of these can be gotten 
by your nearest Permatex dealer. I have found that the off brands just do do 
the same job.  later  Mark dearing
