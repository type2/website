Hi Volks!

I'll echo Mike Benthin's previous comments about the noise (were Bugs
really meant to go that fast and be that loud??) ;--), crowds and chaos
at the Manassas, VA Bugout.  I wouldn't go either but it's only 15
minutes from my house (and a keep thinking I finally find that one part
I'm always looking for.....I don't know what it is but I'll know it when
I see it).

Anyways...we try to make an event out of it and I usually have a
pre-bugout happening at my house, but this year we've decided to &quot;host&quot;
a campout and BBQ the day before the Bugout at the Prince Wm Forest Park
campgound.  So if you're up for camping on May 29th and then heading
over to the Bugout on Sunday morning...read on:

Location:  Prince Wm Forest Park  (located just off I-95...take exit
150B and follow the signs to the park....directions to the campground
are well marked inside the park....it's about 6 more miles once you hit
the park's entrance).

Time:  Anytime....we plan on hitting the campground around noon on May
29th.

What to bring:  Bring your own meat, beverage of choice and if you have
something to share with the group at large...great....if not...join us
anyways!

Note:  This is a national park campground.  No showers or hookups but
there are &quot;comfort&quot; stations with plumbing.  Free firewood.  I think
it's 10 bucks to camp.  First come, first served.

Look for me.....I'm in a 79 westy (beige).

PMail me if you think you'll join us....that way Nance can gauge how big
a batch of magic beans to make.

hope to see you there!

P.S. A benefit of camping Prince Wm is you're on the &quot;right&quot; side of
Manassas.  Most traffic to the bugout location comes from Manassas city
and it really gets backed up.  Even if you don't plan to camp with
us....for you volks coming down I-95 from the north....don't take I-66
to Manassas.  Stay on 95 until you hit exit 152 (Rt 234) and head
towards Manassas.  You'll reach the speedway before you even see the
Manassas city line!

P.S.S....I still have my bay window AC unit for sale.  When I put it on
the list a couple months ago, no less than 4 volks said they REALLY
wanted it but I never heard from them again.  Here's a good opportunity
to pick it up and save shipping $$.
