&gt;I don't know the roots of his thinking, but the bus was the brainchild of

&gt;Pon used available parts to create a utility vehicle for use in the VW
&gt;factory. There's a recap on the web (at a Swedish site) along with some cool
&gt;photos of the first bus.

It's a Dutch site (Ben Pon himself was Dutch). He was also the first person
to import a beetle into the USA.
