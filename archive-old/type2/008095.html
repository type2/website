Subject: DIY Bikerack to fit tire mount
Mime-Version: 1.0

Barry and list:
     Your suggestion of using the front spare tire mount I have done on my
78 Westy....Remove the tire and use a piece of bullnose pine (it comes like
10&quot; wide and is 1&quot; thick; used for stairs) to span from resting on the
extrusion holding the front bumper to going over the bolts and extending up
above them far enouch to bolt on a horizontal piece of 2x4.  Saw out a bit
of the bottom so it sits behind the lip of the  bumper, and glue rubber
shims (wedges) behind it so it cannot rattle.  The board acts as a place to
rest the bike cranks against so they can't hit the body, and holds eyebolts
for bungees..
    The 2x4 at the top was bolted on with 4 bolts countersunk so as to not
be visible, with a layer of closed cell foam (old wet-suit material) along
the front to cushion a bike frame.  To this 2x4 mount 2 arms coming out
horizontally about a foot long- (spaced to let them slip under the top tube
of a bike)...I used 2 bolts on each arm , pulling out a bolt and folding
the arms back when not in use).  The arms I rounded at the top and glue
more foam on top to cushion the frame.  I added large screw eyes at
strategic places to start my bungee cords that held the bikes.  Worked well
for 2 bikes!  It's still laying in garage; now I use a rear rack that I
hang from giant eyebolts I added just below poptop;  it is held by straps
to the bumper.
