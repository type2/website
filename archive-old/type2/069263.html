Just my guess, but the number on the Knecht (613 H) is later than the
number on the Mann (607 C)  which, if I understand the VW numbering scheme
makes it a later model. Comments?

&gt; Hi all - was goofin' some more with aircleaners today... pulled out my
&gt; spare can and found that they are two different makes &amp; models! The one
&gt; that came with my motor is a Knecht; stamped &quot;LB 662/1 504M1&quot; on the top
&gt; part, &quot;Knecht 211 129 613 H  &quot;   and  &quot; LB 662/3&quot; on the bottom. The can
&gt; I've been using is by Mann, stamped &quot; 37  028  58  211&quot; on the top; &quot; 37
&gt; 028 85 271&quot; and  &quot;211 129 607C &quot; on the bottom. The Mann has a
&gt; thermostatically controlled flapper, and the vent on the oilfiller tube
&gt; connects via hose to a fitting on the top part of the cleaner. There is
&gt; also a small fitting on the intake pipe (which I assume to be for
&gt; preheat?), as well as a BIG opening w/ a flap on the bottom of the intake
&gt; which I assume to be for an attachment to the muffler. Which I don't use,
&gt; having a Monza.  The Knecht lacks the thermostat and the fitting on the
&gt; top. I assume we have an earlier and a later model; does anyone (Clara?
;&gt;)
&gt; know which is which... and where some hoses might be better placed! BTW,
I
&gt; would assume there is at least one fitting for the airfilter cannister to
&gt; attach to, except the '70 never had one!
