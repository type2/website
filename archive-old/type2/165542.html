&gt; This brings up another question (I just meant to post this ...): does the
&gt; lower just pass through ist hole in the bearing carrier assembly or is this
&gt; part threaded? Reason for my question is that I have a very hard time
&gt; removing this bolt. The nut is off and the bolt spins - but only using a
&gt; breaker bar and lots of force.

The hole is not threaded.  Penetrating oil, let it soak, then apply force
to the threaded end while wiggling the bolt with a wrench.  It should come
loose with some persuasion.

Before reassembling, put a thin coating of anti-sieze grease on the bolt
to avoid this problem in the future.
