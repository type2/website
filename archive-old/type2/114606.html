&lt;&lt; Anybody have any suggestions on what kind of ahhesive remover to use to 
take up 
all of the original sound deadening stuff in the rear of the 69 bus? Mine is 
a 
little worse for the wear and I've tried several things even this stuff 
called 
Goo Off.  &gt;&gt;

The autobody supply shop has 3M products for this; failing that, a flooring
shop should have the same for removers...Home Despot might, but usually
their stuff is pretty tame...
