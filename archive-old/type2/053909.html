Subject: Backup light lens seals?

Hello all!

I need new backup light lens seals for my '70 Westy. 
These are the ones that seal the chrome frame to the
body of the van.  Haven't been able to find them yet,
and just wanted to see if the rest of you might have a
line on a pair that ain't cracked and falling to dust.
