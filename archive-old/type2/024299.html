Subject: Oil warning light help PLEASE!
Message-ID: &lt;7jsgvl$qe39_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

Thanks for everybody's help on the wobbly speedo.  Now, driving my '71 today, my Oil warning light came on only at idle after about 3 miles.  Every time I came to a complete stop it would come on but even the slightest touch of the accelerator and it would go off.  Is this just a low oil problem or something more serious? Please help!
Thanks,
Matt
