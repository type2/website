I received a private e-mail regarding my post on the Bus Depot.

If anyone (else) perceived my post as 

1.  A slam on them or their choice of vendors or VW parts
2.  My telling anyone they were wrong about anything
3.  My acting as if I was &quot;king of all that is holy in VW land&quot;
4.  My implying that I was smarter than *anyone*
5.  My disregard of others feelings and problems

I most humbly apologize.

I meant zero offense and had thought that I had always avoided any
criticism of anyone's choices.

I am definitely NOT an expert and apologize if I have ever written
anything to present myself as knowing more than the difference between
my ass and a hole in the ground. I try to write only what I've
experienced (check your fuel lines, carry spare parts, don't buy cheap
tires).

I apologize if I've misled anyone at any time about my level of
knowledge -- hey, I'm just a common spud with an old bus that I drive
every day... certainly didn't mean to step on anyone's toes... kinda
baffled at the level of venom in the post I received...
