&gt; The muffler (last replaced 4 years ago) and the heat exchangers (never

&gt; want to spend the big money for a pair of heat exchangers when I don't
&gt; need the heat.  Also, I hear those Brazillian ones don't last.
&gt; 
&gt; What are my other options?  Is there some kind of item that I can use to
&gt; replace the heat exchangers and still use the stock exhaust?  Bob only
&gt; mentions not liking the &quot;cheap&quot; extractors.  Are there good extractors? 

try a J tube RMMW part 37509  only $14.95 pair, fits 71 bus.  I had to
make em for my 78, PITA
