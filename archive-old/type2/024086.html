Subject: bilge pump blowers
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

hey folks,
         Now that my 70 camper is back on the road after the engine pull for 
the throwout bearing i can get back to heating. I bought a turbo bilge blower 
from a boating store and have built a housing for it out of stove pipe and 
are ready to install. With the talk of melting plastic in the heat channel 
has anyone melted their blower ?
