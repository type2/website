Subject: Re: [T2] Need Westfalia Camper manual

www.vanagon_dot_com

Somebody has these manuals on their website...

http://gerry.vanagon_dot_com/files/bus-vanagon-literature-database.txt



 &gt;Well, after driving my '81 Vanagon all these years I....
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;finally broke down and bought an '82 Westy!  I though the supplemental
&gt; &gt;camper manual was in the car but it turns out it was just a second copy of
&gt; &gt;the Vanagon manual.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Anyway, I seem to recall that these manuals were being re-published by some
&gt; &gt;outfit, but I don't know who.  Can anybody point me in the right direction?
