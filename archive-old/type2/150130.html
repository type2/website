Subject: re: Hubcap stranded in NYC

Hi Volks,

Remember the Hubcap Tour? It's still out there, but it ran aground  
when the carrier's bus failed to make it to Alaska last summer. Since  
then the person in custody of the tour box has been unable to attend  
any bus events.

Are there any list members in the NYC area who could rendezvous with  
David and get the hubcap back into circulation? Ideally it would be  
nice to see the hubcap head out to the west coast for a change.

If you can help, please email vwwestyman_at_yahoo_dot_com, NOT me.



Happy trails,

Greg Potts

Hello all-

I may potentially have a connundrum.

As most of you should be aware, I have had the
hubcap/trunk since last year's Mo-Kan show since I
have been unable to attend a VW and/or bus show since
then, as much as I've wanted to and tried for one
reason or another they haven't worked out.

Now, I know that one of the &quot;rules&quot; is that it should
always be carried by a bus to/from each handoff.

I also know that it should be handed to the next
person as soon as possible and in my case the Mo-Kan
show seems like a time when it may finally be
possible.  Believe me, I've tried to get to
shows/campouts since then and I feel bad for having it
as long as I have.

Here's where the connundrum plays in:  I've been
letting a friend use the bus this past week or so.  He
mentioned to me tonight that it may be running just a
little funny.  So, now I'm not sure if I should risk
driving it 90 miles from Manhattan to Lawrence.  I
don't know if 1) it'll make it and 2) if it did make
it, would driving it that distance cause further
problems/make things worse and more expensive?
