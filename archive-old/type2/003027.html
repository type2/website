Well no, BUT, McMaster-Carr sells a high temp rated silicon though
uninsulated, more than sufficient to take the heat directly off a gas
heater, I've used it on exchangers in direct contact with exhaust right out
of the heads and it lasts fine, but it is $teep.

Go www.mcmaster_dot_com and page 109 for the silicone coated fiberglass hose,
good to 600F and quite workable and bendable, the 2.25 or 2.5 inch should
suffice depending on what you decide is best.   On could wrap the hose in a
fiberglass insulation layer if they desired but with that BN4 firing I doubt
you'll need to worry about heat loss.

Stuff is going to set you back $8-$10 per foot but is worth it.

The factory stuff is certainly wonderful but gets real touchy with age and
though insulating probably isn't all that effective.  Plus it doesn't seem
to exist, have wondered about why some of the repro places don't try to jump
on it.
