&gt;  I know I can guess with the length of the breaker bar and cheater bar
&gt;  combined times the weight on the end, but frankly it worries me because you
&gt;  never really know how much weight your putting on that thing.  Your either
&gt;  on it completely (your total weight) or just kinda on it (some weight).  
How
&gt;  do you figure it out?

Stand on your bathroom scales while applying the force to the breaker bar and 
the torque is simply your apparent change in weight times the distance from 
the center at which you hold the bar.

Good luck
