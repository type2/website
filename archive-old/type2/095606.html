Subject: RE: [T2] Adding Oxygen Sensor.

&gt; Since I just acquired an '82 Federal Westy to compliment my '81 California
&gt; Vanagon, and since the Westy has a &quot;shot&quot; muffler welded to the catalytic
&gt; converter in front of it, is what you suggest below a viable way for me to
&gt; replace the catalytic converter/muffler combo, assuming I don't
&gt; want to stay &quot;stock&quot;?  I'm intrigued because I'm trying to figure out if I
&gt; want the Westy to stay Federal or convert it to California and here's a
way to make the
&gt; conversion without committing to all the somewhat-scarce left-side
&gt; components (heat exchanger, separate manifold) of the California model.


If I understand correctly what you're trying to do, yes.  This combination
(49-state Vanagon heat exchangers and crossover pipe with watercooled
Vanagon cat and 1.9L watercooled Vanagon muffler) will work and fit just the
same as the stock 49-state setup, but with a provision for an 02 sensor.
Compared to the California setup, it does away with the rare and expensive
left-side California only heat exchanger. Incidentally, the same exhaust
works on a '79 bus as well (if used with '79 49-state heat exchangers).
