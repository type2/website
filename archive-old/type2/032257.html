I had the same problem.

I used a hex socket of the correct size and it broke free.  Try to get a
good one, not a  cheep-o chinese one, the metal must be still enough.  I
was able to get a different plug from a junk yard which had a normal hex
bolt, so I don't think I'll have the problem again.  If yuo destroy the
hole, you could drill it out a little (not through) and then reverse
thread the hole and screw into it, but try not to destroy the hole.
