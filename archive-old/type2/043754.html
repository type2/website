Subject: RE: [T2] Rubber Fuel Filler Elbows

&gt; Does anyone out there (Karl?) know if the rubber fuel filler elbow for a
&gt; '79 bus is any different than those for a 74-78 bus??  My '79
&gt; uses unleaded
&gt; only and I believe has a nozzle restrictor.


'79 is the only 49-state year that used an unleaded restrictor.  However, I
have not yet heard of anyone getting failed for inspection for having the
unrestricted one on their 49-state bus.  Before these 49-state elbows became
unobtainable, people put them on their '79's all the time.  Of course
technically I suppose they could fail you for it, if they noticed it, but I
really doubt they would.
