Subject: [T2] Epiphanous motor install...

Hi all -

Well, a huge THANKS!! to all patient souls from the list who helped me 
(greatly!) along the way.  The motor was officially in Sunday night, but 
exhaust from local shop wasn't the right one/bolt patterns off a tad, would 
have to crush the cooling duct coming off of the left heat exhanger (I very 
clearly had told the folks, on a couple occasions,  that it is &quot;a 1980 
Volkswagen Vanagon, Westfalia get-up&quot;, in addition to exhaustingly - 
probably for the guy at the shop - describing my exhaust) for the new 
exhaust to even be flush.  The angle didn't account for bolt patterns not 
matching.  We held it up to the stock exhaust, bolt holes were off by more 
1/4 inch.  Of course, were I more intimately familiar w/my vehicle at the 
time of purchase, I would've known that.

So, anyhow we just had to fire it up, if only for a few sweet moments.  A 
sweet, SWEET moment (w/deck lid off, back hatch open to a wall about 10 feet 
behind vehicle, &amp; my heightened imagination, it sounded - for a moment - 
like an old friend, the 1977 Chrysler New Yorker Brougham, w/the last of the 
forged 440s).  Back the next morning to put on correct muffler (don't know 
that Colorado will welcome me back sans catalytic converter/EGR filter) to 
fiddle w/timing &amp; idle so we could drive it the short distance to (we were 
leaning - unintentionally - to the lean/spark plug approaching white, says 
fella at...) Total Performance and have fuel/air mixture &amp; timing 
fine-tuned.  Dealt quite a bit w/Tom, who is a great guy willing to explain 
things to a very excited greenhorn (he has a '78 Westy).  (Another &quot;great 
guy&quot; mention:  Jim &amp; John ((nln retained)) _at_ Fischer Buggies)

Had some tapping, the mechanic (didn't catch his name, also answered many of 
my questions while I pestered him from time to time w/the Westy overhead) 
checked the valves &amp; found something that wasn't there:  a washer from one 
of the left/3&amp;4 rocker shaft support retaining nuts that he said either a) 
wasn't there to begin with, or b) &quot;came off &amp; went into your filter or down 
onto the strainer.&quot;  Do I drain my oil now &amp; look, could the naughty washer 
be someplace it shouldn't be, or what?  I, in firing a rapid spray of 
queries at mechanic, jumped off to something else, then another thing, &amp; 
then this &amp; that (you'd never guess, huh?).  He checked wiring over, used 
some gasket sealer on the left valve cover gasket (had a light leak, we 
fixed one on the right side earlier that morning), did the timing, fuel/air, 
valve adjustment (another query, &quot;I thought hydraulic lifters didn't need 
any adjustment...&quot; - duh on my part, my buddy had said that it sounded like 
the valves needed to be adjusted...) &amp; then it was as if the Vanagon wasn't 
running.  It was, &amp; beautifully.  Our semblance, music to the ears 
nonetheless, paled in comparison.  When it was done, he gave my buddy &amp; I an 
ambiguous &quot;not half bad&quot; rating on our install, which Tom (dipolmatically, 
maybe?) translated as a compliment.

Well, I've rambled and the gist is in there somewhere.  I'd seen someone's 
(sorry, forgot sender's name) missive along the lines of &quot;that feeling.&quot;  I 
think I've got some.  As much as I enjoyed driving the Vanagon before I 
hopped into this eddy, it will never compare to the bond I gained from 
grappling w/&quot;Freedom Enterprise's&quot; innards, &amp; becoming a blood/oil brother 
w/&quot;that&quot; which formerly just propelled me.

Thank you everyone!!  Hope to start hitting an event or two, maybe late Fall 
or next Spring.  A momentous Summer!  Oh, yeah, so do I drain oil/look for 
washer?

A very good night,

Mark, '80 Westy, &quot;Freedom Enterprise&quot; standing by in Tampa
