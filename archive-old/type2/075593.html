Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Oil light flickers on new rebuild.

David Schwarze sends:

&gt; I agree.  My heads don't appear to run any hotter, although I'll admit my
&gt; gauge isn't that precise.  No head problems though in 90,000 straight miles
&gt; of synthetic oil usage.  I don't need a book to tell me it works (or
&gt; doesn't work).  Go to a Nascar race and see how many of them are not using
&gt; synthetic oil.

Which shows another advantage to synthetic: lower friction. For us that
means better gas mileage and less wear; for them it also means more
horsepower. (It means more potential HP for us too, but if I have 67hp
instead of 66 it's not going to be real noticeable; those guys are looking
for every HP they can get.)
