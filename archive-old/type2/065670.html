Subject: Safari winders going

I have thought about it on and off this summer.  I live in an area where
precipitation is the norm over half the year, and temperatures over 75 come
not too often.   I have visions of puddles, a veritable stream pouring down
Nellie's dash, on my legs, and through the holes rusted in the floor.  So the
safaris are GOING.    BYE BYE!!

Actually they are already out of the bus.   It's an original German set,
 complete with all the widgets, including the 65-67 style wiper disconnects,
and original dried out rubber seals.  They'll be for sale at Puyallup this
weekend, if anyone is interested.    Maybe they'ld be nice on a garaged bus.
