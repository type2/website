Subject: Vent window hinge rivet

OK Folks,
 
I've got to ask another question.  This time it's about the rivet in the
upper hinge of the vent window in the drivers door of our '71.
Basically what I need to know is how do I go about setting the rivet.  It's
got a hollow tail and I'm sure there must be a special tool to do this
properly.  In fact I can ALMOST  remember seeing a tool on some vendors web
site to do this job.  I've just spent a bunch of time checking web sites,
including the type2 library and archives, to no avail.  I'm bleary eyed and
have given up.
 
Can anyone either tell me how to set these rivets or where to get the tool
to do it with?
 
Thanks in advance
