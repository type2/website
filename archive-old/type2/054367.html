Isaiah,

is he running a stock, or an 009 dizzy, on this 1600-DP type 1,
upright,*MOFOCO* engine?

&gt; well volks...I think I found a burnt piston.
&gt; The shop that the guy took it to to have it timed and tuned up etc... I
&gt; found out last night they set the timing at 27' BTDC...or so the guy
&gt; says...because &quot;it ran best there&quot;.  On an upright motor?? who's he
&gt; kidding??
&gt; well.._dot_compression test today shows 120 on 1,2, and 4...but #3 is 0.  A
&gt; big fat 0.  so...I think that he burned a hole in the piston...
&gt; Does he have any recourse to the shop that did this??  It was a costly
&gt; mistake....and it turned out it wasn't mofoco's fault!!  but the motor
&gt; only has 200 miles on it...so I'm sure mofoco has screwed up something
&gt; and it will show up later on...
&gt;
&gt; well...thats where I'm at now...
