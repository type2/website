Subject: light fasteners

Does anyone have a quick fix for the white plastic fasteners that hold
the parking lights in on the rear sides of the bus?  While washing my
bus I noticed the rear light fixture was loose.  Both clips are broke
and now I have a light hanging off the side of my bus.  I am hoping this
is something I can find at a local hardware or auto parts store.
Otherwise I guess I will have to get the tape out and then order one.
Wait.... can you order these things?
