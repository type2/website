John and the list

On 4.10.99 Safelite came out to install a new windsheild in the '72
westfakia. On 4.11.99 it leaked leaked like a seive.

Safelite came out to &quot;fix&quot; it on Monday. Their idea of fixing it nvoleved
slathering BLACK urathane sealant all over my pretty new seal and the body.
I looks like sh!t and I am pissed. I called and complained so now the
manager and the installer are coming out to work on Wednesday morning to
&quot;correct the problem.&quot; They are already blaming the WCM seal for the leak. I
disagree because the window was not seated properly in the frame and THAT is
the obvious cause of the leak. I will report on their next attempt to
correct the mess that has been made. If you wanna come by in the morning to
witness this redress just let me know.

&gt;Chris,
&gt;  If the safelite guy comes back to &quot;reinstall&quot; your windshield please give 
&gt;me a call, I'd love to see &quot;how it's done&quot;. I've got 2 bay windshields I'd 
&gt;like to renew the seal on, and I'm sure I'd learn something from watching a 
&gt;professional.
&gt;    Thanks, see you friday in the park!
&gt;     John
