Subject: Re: [T2] Gross Polluters

How did I know that using the Air Force as an example would backfire on 
me...(pun intended).  In expressing my distaste of being told what we 
&quot;should all do&quot; too hastily, I grabbed theat reference from the ether.  Lets 
see...how about the SUV.  No, too many kids being shuttled about in 
those...What about diesel earth-moving equipment.  No...we need those to dig 
quarries and bury our radioactive waste...garbage trucks?  My pointless 
point is, that the consumer vehicle, ton for ton, puts less waste into the 
air than commercial and military practices do, and yet the consumer is 
charged with the responsibility of &quot;keeping things clean&quot;.  It's a 
smokescreen IMHO(yes, another pun).  I, for one, will not swallow the 
responsibility that my classic vehicle, which runs WELL within its emission 
limitations, is destroying the ozone layer in the arctic circle.  Our buses 
are a dying breed, and the few that are left should not be legislated from 
the roads.  When elctric cars are the norm, and fuel cells are cheaply 
available, I'll install a German version in my engine bay.  For now, I'll 
keep working on that VR6 swap(more for power and convenience than to protect 
the grunnion run).

	Eron
