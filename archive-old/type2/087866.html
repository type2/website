Subject: Re: [T2] bucket seats

I have the drivers seat from a Pontiac Fiero in my Westy, very =
comfortable compared to the stock seat. I was able to remove the track =
from the bottom of a trashed Westy seat, and with drilling only a couple =
of holes mount it to the bottom of the Fiero seat, that way the seat =
tracks in the Westy stay stock, so I can switch back to the stock seat =
at any time. I would NOT remove the fixed tracks in order to install =
another seat, too much of a PITA to restore should you want to go back.  =
