&gt;Subject: trade a '65 camper for a '77 ...
&gt;
&gt;We have had our '77 Westy for almost 8 years, and it is going on 350,000
miles, I think Tara's magic bus is about to be retired. Rust has taken it's
toll. 
&gt;
&gt;We also have a 1965 Westy, 77,000 miles, untoughed original engine, a
beautiful drive away side tent [used only by us], Roof rack, childs
hammock, the works. It is a beautiful bus that was owned by an older couple
that only used it in the summer for camping.
&gt;
&gt;We are of to Newfoundland for a month this summer, and the truth of it all
is that we use our vehicles really hard. Our '77 was a work horse, it has a
trailer hitch, and i have used it to tow a car carrier trailer with our
Farmall tractor on it. Been everywehre, done everything.
&gt;
&gt;But I had this idea. Instead of putting a new engine in the '65,
converting to 12volts , drilling holes for the Webasto hot air furnace,,
etc. etc, it might make more sense to trade our '65 for another '77. Tara's
magic bus would make a great parts bus, and someone could enjoy the
untouched '65, maybe more than we would.
&gt;
&gt;So I am throwing out this idea. Would someone like to trade a rust free
'77, or '78 Westy, hopefully fairly low mileage, for our '65??
&gt;
&gt;Give it some thought, or if yo uknow anyone, please let us know. We are in
Connecticut.
&gt;
&gt;thanks, Jim
