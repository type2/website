Hi volks
glad to be back on the list with my own server, its hard to keep track of
things when your on a loaner. Made the jump from the land of mickey mouse up
here to the land of eternal rain and cold in the rain forest the locals call
Vancouver island. Any listees up here? The island seems to be where old
westies go to retire and I've already picked up a 72. This kinda appeases my
son who has yet to forgive me for selling 'his' 70. Selling the 69 was ok by
him because it went to Nicky as long as she gives updates on its
progress.I'm looking forward to playing with a type 4 engine and gas heater,
just hope I dont end up sounding too much like a newby
Chuck
72 westy
70 westy in the wind
69 westy being saved
