Subject: exhaust changeover

Now this is the conversation I wanted to have and this is the time to 
think about heat.  Do you want to be crawling under your bus when it's 
20 degees outside?  If you want to upgrade the heat start getting the 
parts now!  Now do the flaps also need to be changed.  In the long run, 
I am thinking of doing the door seals and recirculating to make the heat 
work.  Parts that need to be changed are engine tin, heat exhanges, 
muffler, Any other?  At this point I am thinking of just keeping the 
factory exhaust.  By the way, this is all because my elbow snapped 40 
miles from home coming back from everybus. 
Jon
