Subject: CV question

I removed and inspected my CV joints and they looked very good. The are not 
original so have been replaced. But two of then lack free movement and seem 
to be jammed. I took one of the jammed ones out and reinspected and 
reinstalled making sure the balls were in well in the sockets, but still very 
limited movement. Is this a concern? I was not able to install them because 
of a lack of angle.

On writer indicate he got complete kits for $66.00 that seems very good I am 
wondering what the name and location of the Flaps was? 

Thanks in advance

Tom
