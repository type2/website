&gt; &gt;Everything seems OK.  I have heard older cars dont like this extra oxygenated
&gt; &gt;fuel we use during cold weather in Maryland.

&gt; Hahaha, cold weather in Maryland.  Too funny.  I'm moving back to Maryland
&gt; to escape the cold weather of Chicago.  I'm looking forward to never seeing
&gt; a (-) sign in front of the air temperature, unless being stated in Celcius.

I may live in Maryland but my bus is my ski transport machine, cranking
that thing up before dawn in Vermont when there are double digits after
that (-) sign...takes some tuning and good batteries etc.

we occasionally get the (-F) here in MD too, just not usually quite as
windy as Chicago though
