Subject: Block Damage and the clutch results [lengthy recourse]

Pffttttt..... Well.... I took my trusty Kevin down to the mechanic today
(nice hour long drive... at least it was along the coast).. Showed him a
list of things to check regarding the clutch issue and told him to do the
main seal, valves and oil cooler on account of the monumental oil leak. :-/
Anyhoo, I ring them at lunch time to get an update and have a guess what the
problem is?
A cracked block!!!!!! &lt;ugh&gt;  Which explains the monumental oil consumption
and leaks. tsk..frown...
So, turns out they can do a new block for $1000, second hand for maybe $350.
Bearing in mind I told him I only had $500 anyway.....
So I hung up to think it over and call them back after I'd stopped slapping
my forehead.
Anyway, I rang back and explained my severe lack of funds.. Thought about
taking it off the road and buying a POC to drive...
He's going to try some spray on metal 'schtuff' on it.. Said I've got
nothing to lose so we might as well give it a go. I agree with him. I'm
going to check it out tomorrow when I go down  there (hello public
transport), but I get the feeling that this guy is not trying to rip me off
at all. Apparently there's a good chance it won't work, but a fair chance it
might and at the end of the day the block is still stuffed anyway isn't i?
He's going to get a second hand pressure plate for the clutch and machine
the flywheel (think he said that.... yeh, he did...? )and hopefully get me
out of it as economically as possible, and within my $500.. At least til I
can remotely afford a 2nd hand block... tsk again...
So, the clutch diagnosis was spot on the money, thank you to you all!.....
shame the bl**dy oil cooler wasn't my problem instead of the .......'n
block!!!! oh grief...
So, while I wait 12 hours for this spray on metal sealer stuff to cure and
hopefully hold the block together for a while......... I'll ponder my
navel......

'69 Kombi.... Kevin, alack he was a fair and gentle ride....
