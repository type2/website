Subject: Re: [T2] fuse block info needed

[...]
Backside connections many times have little physical location 
correllation with the front fuse positions.  i.e. pin 22 may be located 
physically behind fuse s3 but actually be connected to fuse s2 or s4 or 
s5.  Will do it the hard way by pulling and confirming terminal 
connections.  Probably better that way anyway.  then i an make sure 
there are no other sneaky surprises in this wiring

&gt;&gt; Problem is i need the back side of the fuse panel.  The bently gives 
&gt;&gt; the numbering etc. which is needed to tell which pin to connect to.  
&gt;&gt; but the box isnt numbered.  Will have to do it the hard way probably.

&gt; We the way i read the schematic the fuses are number S1 - S12 left to 
&gt; right.
&gt;
&gt; So for example S8 and S9 handles the ignition buzzer and apparently the 
&gt; dome light. On my copy it appears to handle red and red/white wires.
&gt;
&gt; With a Bentley in front of me I could read it more exact and carefully.
