&gt;if the flap is closed when the piece that holds the

&gt;of the engine bay. then how will an EXPANDING
&gt;thermostat PULL that arm down in order to open the
&gt;flap??? shouldnt it be shrinking??

The flaps don't work exactly as you might think.  When the piece you 
describe above is pointing straight up, the flaps are open and the 
thermostat is expanded.  When the thermostat shrinks and pulls the piece so 
that it is pointing more forward, the flaps are closed.  The left and right 
flaps actually move in opposite directions (irrelevent, but interesting).
