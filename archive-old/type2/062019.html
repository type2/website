&gt; I didn't make it down to Eureka Springs (Arkansas) as I had to deliver a

I returned last night.  It really was a great show, an incredible
turn-out.  The new location at a large hotel/motel helped a lot as there
was a lot more space, especially for the swap meet.  Lotsa very nice
vintage, customs, buggies, campers etc.  It was a good one!  8-)
