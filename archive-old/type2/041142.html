Subject: Re: gray paste in oil sump

Dakhlia, Sami sends:

&gt; I found a little bit of a deposit in the oil sump of a 1600, a gray-ish
&gt; paste. Magnesium? Tiny little specs of shiny metal could also be seen once
&gt; the paste was spread on a clean rag.

Sounds like metal off your bearings to me. You should see a little of this--
bearings do wear with use. As long as the engine's running good, this isn't
a problem.
