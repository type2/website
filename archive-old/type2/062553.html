Subject: Re: Cylinder to Head Sealing Rings

&gt;If my old heads have sealing rings on the cylinder shoulders, should I
&gt;blankly assume that I need sealing rings on new heads, or is there some
&gt;way of knowing whether I need them or not?

They're there from a previous rebuild. Their purpose is to lower the
compression ratio. For a rebuild I'd probably replace them with new ones
because I wouldn't know whether I should or not, so I'd be cautious, but
essentially you're hacking; just switch the old spacers to the new heads.
It would be smart to at least measure the volume of the old heads vs. the
new ones to make sure your compression ratio won't be wildly different from
the old engine. It the chamber is substantially smaller, you'll want new
bigger spacers. Hoover has a lot to say about this on his web page.

&gt;Is there anything I should watch out for when I am only replacing the heads
&gt;on an engine with about 35,000 miles on it?

Don't bother the cylinders or pistons. Don't turn the crank at all. Wire
the cylinders in unless you're really confident.

&gt;If one of the head studs comes unthreaded from the case, can I just put some
&gt;Loktite on it and thread it back in?

You can if you want it to blow up again. ;) If I were in your situation I'd
probably put some JB Weld in the hole, a little more on the threads, and
bolt it up. But I wouldn't tell anybody, I'd keep it a secret. ;) You need
a case saver in there, but if you do that you'll have to split the case
because of shrapnel.

&gt;This is a 1600 single port in a 1964 Westy.  I plan on building a
&gt;replacement engine over the next couple of months, but need to keep the
&gt;bus on the road in the meantime.
