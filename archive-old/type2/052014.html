Subject: [T2] Painting a 78 Westy

Volks,

I have two purposes in mind: 1) Premium paint and body work 2) Lowest price
possible

In an epiphone, I contacted a local paint &amp; body shop and asked the owner if
he'd be interested in giving me a steeply discounted or free paint job if I
allowed a certain amount of advertising space for his company.

My questions:
1 - How much is some minor prep and a premium paint job on a 78 Westy
actually worth?
2 - Has anyone else done this?
3 - What should be the limit for advertising space?
4 - Should I demand free or discount?

Any input would be sincerely appreciated!
