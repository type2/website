Subject: Tire Report 

Just purchased a set of Liberator truck tires in
225/70/14 for my bus from Walmart.  Paid $45 plus
$7 for mounting and roadhazard.  

Here's a link:
http://www.walmart_dot_com/catalog/content_shops.gsp?cat=77604

 The larger tires fit fine.  No rubbing at all.  
No noticeable affect on power.   Haven't checked
the speedo to see if it's off enough to register.
 Ride is good, or even too soft for my taste.  
No noticeable noise.   

The load rating is adequate at 1625 lbs.  I have
them at 35psi which is the tire's max.  This is
my only concern.  Having run passenger tires on
busses in the past, I have learned my lesson and
prefer adequate load range (1625lbs is ok) and 
higher pressure.    I thought the tire said 45
psi max.   

My tires on my vanagon were D-rated
Cooper/Mastercraft  Courser R/D 195/(85)/14's
that were inflated to 45psi and a load rating of
2000 lbs per tire.  I really like those tires. 
The stiff sidewalls meant very little sway on the
interstate or going around curves.   However,
there road style tread wasn't what I wanted for
the camper.  

Had I known of the max pressure, I might have
hesitated and purchased instead a set of
LT27x8.5x14.  (I also considered a mud terrain
tread instead of an all terrain.  As our busses
cannot go that fast on the interstate, but need
good traction for camping, I don't view it as
much of a tradeoff.   Wouldn't put aggressive
tires on my other vehicles, but the are capable
of sustained 75mph on the interstate.) 

Overall, pretty happy with the purchase,
especially the price and walmart's guarantee and
availability of service.  I cannot wait to try
these things out on the dirt roads this summer.
