You speak truly, Andy.
 
&gt; As I looked at the other cars and drivers in the gas station It occured to
&gt; me that maybe it was not just a case of non-empathy that led them to not
&gt; help her but perhaps a social change WRT automobiles and our relationship
&gt; with them.

There is a bus-specific response to this trend. Whether deserved or not
(and I think not), buses probably have the worst reputation for breaking
down on the road (overtaking MGs, which I would not have thought
possible). 

Given that, there is something we can do to challenge the general trend: 
be happy. Smile a lot. Laugh a lot. Not in an expression of what the fed 
chairman calls &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; but from a pure, simple, sheer 
pleasure in executing our hard-won skills and competence, our hands well 
oiled by a sometimes balky but by-gum simple machine.

Nothing succeeds like success. When you move down the highway in a bus 
you -- type 2 brother or sister -- are a success. Raise high the garage 
beams, carpenter!
