I agree it shouldn't be scrapped but maybe the folks who don't respond
should be asterisked to indicate data may be out of date

&gt; users could add/edit/delete their info in real time, instead of relying on
&gt; some poor soul who updates the html pages manually. The current info could
&gt; be parsed out and inserted into tables, or manually added if need be.  Then
&gt; from that people could not only print out users per state, but could search
&gt; based on a zip or area code or what not so if someone was only going to be
&gt; in N texas they wouldn't have to print out everyone in the whole state.

I'm very concerned that the data might get to the point that it couldn't
be accessed over a text based system or a palm or even the text telephones
which need text to operate, and hate tables.

&gt; I'm almost wondering if there's like a contact management system out on the
&gt; web we could use for this instead of having to create something from
&gt; scratch. And I just doubt there's currently someone out there with the
&gt; skill, time, and motivation to make this happen for AIRS.

skill, probably but they would most likely prefer working on their bus...I
would also be carefull of anything proprietary or dependent on a
particular piece of software. needs to be like this list, slim, text, no
attachments, etc.....

what's wrong with the current list, except no one to maintain it
