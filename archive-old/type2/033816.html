Subject: High Top Registry Lives - update !!

Well, there's about half a dozen people contributing and encouraging me
and we have about six High Tops documented with VINs and another five or
six known or sighted, some with pictures. I think we have our first
internationally located member but I have to get some clarification on
his home base before it's affirmed.

So far we have Whale Tops (full dome roofs), and roofs that are half
dome with some flat luggage area topside, usually to the rear. These are
AdventureWagens and Safares. Also said to exist are VW mfg delivery vans
with dome roofs. If you know of anymore detail or spot any wrong
information here, please speak up.

The Registry workings will be explained shortly but for now ..........

All fiberglass raised roof conversions are going to be called High Tops
and all types are welcomed. My goal is to include and count them all and
have a club/hobby/friendship kinda feel to this.

Anybody can submit a sighting with a picture and it will be counted in
the total known to exist in the Registry database. The contributor will
be credited. To prevent duplication of sightings and counting, vehicles
submitted with a VIN number will receive a special Registry number
starting with #1 and the last four numbers of the VIN and that list will
become the official Registry roll.

I'm looking for a web page program and as soon as I can handle it all
the pictures, names, stories and messages will be online.

Until then email me and I'll send you new pictures of my '72 Whale Top.
