Subject: Re: Re: [T2] Pimp My Ride on M-TV

I have seen the driveshaft and won't watch again... Basically instead of fixing a problem, they waste a car - admittedly one that has little resale value... 

I have long been aggravated by Hollywood wasting cars that were far better than the ones I drove... Not now, but once upon a time. 

I like the ones that make them better, not make them a mess. 

Prob the director(s) and producers figure Americans want to see all the bashing and a bunch prob do. Goes right along with the throw-away mentality some folks have.
