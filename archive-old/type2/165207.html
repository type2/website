Subject: Re: [T2] The 248K mi engine run with TUFOIL disassembled report

&gt;         Mind you, I don't know how far a Toymota Corolla will go in
&gt; the corresponding expt without Slick 50  ...


And that's the problem. They never do side-by-side comparisons.

I've been to enough car shows where the oil and coolant were drained
and the engine revved past the redline. It often takes hours for the
engine to sieze. Of course, this is sitting still not climbing Pikes
Peak, but you get the idea.

Youtube has several videos of similar runs. I'm on dialup so you'll
have to search yourself.
