Subject: Re: [T2] '78 Sunroof new owner basics

Hi Joseph,

1. The first year of ownership may bring many hidden issues to light. 
Focus on safety first and the other issues will be less tragic.

A. Replace all your fuel lines ASAP, unless you can document that they 
have been done already in the past 18 months. And even if they have 
been done, visit http://www.ratwell_dot_com/technical/FuelHoses.html and 
check to make sure they were done right.

B. Check the brakes and steering. There's a rubber flex coupling at the 
bottom of the steering wheel shaft just below the floor, that one 
should be looked at.

C. Make sure all the cooling system components and seals are in place.



2. Drive it gently and it'll be happy. Thrash it and you'll get bitten 
eventually. Aircooled engines seem to have developed an appetite for 
exhaust valve seats, particularly on the type4 engine.

A. A cylinder head temp (CHT) gauge will help let you know what's going 
on in the engine compartment.... If/When it gets up to 450F, get off 
the gas pedal. CHT responds very quickly to load conditions, and if you 
reduce the load the temp recovers quickly.

B. Don't lug the engine. Aircooled motors need cooling and oil pressure 
they can't get at low RPMs.



3. Fuel additives are not required. Can you still get leaded fuel in 
MT??


Happy trails,
