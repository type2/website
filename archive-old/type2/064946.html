I feel that there was and is a demand.  VWoA has failed to exploit it.  My
co-workers are constantly impressed by the utility of my 15year old vanagon
as a work truck and if more were avaible (at a reasonable cost (and new) I
feel that they could be sold ( not the wagons and campers that were avaible
but plain old vans, after all, a large ammount of the labor in a vehicle is
in the interior and step one for a work truck is to rip it all out) 

WV's were also hit hard by the tarif on imported trucks.  They should have
played the same game as the others (final assembly in the US).

There are a number small things that all say the same thing.  By the 80's
VWoA just didn't care to fight for the US commercial market.(if it helps, I
will remind you that Toyota has also droped thier commercial van line in the US)

wish work van; vanagon w/ tdi, panel body (window in back and sliding door
only), syncro, no interior trim aft of the driver seat area.

        For the first time a civilized

        Our streets will be safer,
        our police more efficient,

        our lead into the future!&quot;
