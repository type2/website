I recently heard of a store called the &quot;Bus Stop&quot;.
Does anyone now the phone number? Address?
.................................................
The Bus Stop was the title of a &quot;catalog&quot; that was ditributed by Rocky
Mountain Motorworks. I am looking at it right now. The one I am looking at
has a 1994 date on it. Try 1-800-544-5357 for more info m-f 8-6pm MST.
1-800-544-1066 24hr/7days for catalog requests.

*otherwise*

The &quot;real&quot; Bus Stop is run by a fella known as Charlie Hamill, P.O. Box 755
Westminster, CA 92683 (714) 892-5293. Call between 10am and 6Pm Pacific time.
He tends to take his coffee a &quot;tad&quot; later in the AM and works until late.
Charlie is a great guy and a definite craftsman in the old world sense of
the word. He specializes in the metal work and coordination of dead on the
money VW restorations. He also has a wealth of resources for locating NOS
bits and pieces from minor items up to major original body panels for buses
and *possibly* other models of VWs.
I had the image in my mind that he was beyond approach and bothering with
the little &quot;guy.&quot; Conversely I have found him to be very approachable and
helpful. Very nice guy. He has also been very helpful in Michael Hendricks'
&lt; mjhenks_at_ENGR.CSULB.EDU &gt; prise winning double cab. He is extremely busy
and a businessman. With respect to his time, it is good to be ready to do
business and have a specific purpose when you contact him. If you can't find
it anywhere call Charlie.
Tell him &quot;hello&quot; for me if you call!
