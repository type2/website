Subject: Mud Flaps Group Purchase
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

The response so far this Sunday morning has been high. I believe that if ONE
of the recommended vendors would do a group purchase would be better than a
non-business individual could do.

**Is Kyle, Jim, or Ron interested???**

For those of you who have received page 43 from Just Kampers, what do you
think of the mud flaps?? I intend on making a purchase myself, but it would
be better if we could save some money and let one of the recommended vendors
do a group purchase.
