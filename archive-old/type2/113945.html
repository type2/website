&gt;Now, any thoughts as to why it would change while idling? I will have my

&gt;4 and 9 BTDC. The average is still 7.5, but a lot of the time its just
&gt;surging and going above and below that. 

Usually it's because of a worn distributor shaft.  Also check for loose distributor clamp, loose distributor cap, etc..  Also pull and plug the vacuum hose to the distributor to make sure that your advance mechanism isn't contributing.
