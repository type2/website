A word of caution here...

I have a '72 that was manufactured in July and August (label says so), the
months spanning the break in the size difference of the beake shoes, so the date
of manufacture info does me no good in determining the proper brake shoe. It
turns out that the difference in shoes is not only the width, but the diameter
as well. Those of you who are not asked what shoe you need are getting the
smaller shoe.
