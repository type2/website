Content-Description: cc:Mail note part

None of the ECU's used in the VW bus or Vanagons will have any problems with the
year 200 problem. The  L-Jetronic ECU's don't even have a CPU, let alone any
kind of clock to tell them what year it is. Latter digijet or digifant do have
more advanced ECU's but still have no clock or any memory to remember what year
it is.
