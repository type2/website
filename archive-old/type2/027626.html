Will a bunk for a late westy (rear hinged?) fit in the roof of a front 
hinged westy?

Chris.

It's unlikely that the later bunk will fit, owing to being much longer or so 
I suspect, given that the associated elevating roof is about two feet 
longer. I suggest you ask for bunk size measurements and compare that with 
the space you have available.

I personally have a 1973 Westfalia, with a front hinged roof and would like 
a longer, wider and thicker upholstered roof bed.
