The cyberdyne is a nice unit a friend uses one on his 427 vette
which is where I saw it 1st, and I'm sure as good resolution
as any.  Frankly driving 10 LED's over a 1V range don't happen
very many ways and there isn't any real possibility for innacuracy
with digital stuff.  Yeah the CB and other analog gages are ???,
and mostly I just use the good ole Fluke DVM.  Actually I misread
the gage is still $32, the O2 sensor and bung (I assume) are only
$50, 20 feet of nice 4 conductor shielded Belden cable probably set
anyone back about $1/foot at the worst.

PN's 280-7009 and 280-8941 respectively from Jegs.  Limited lifetime
warranty on cyberdyne gages, auto night dimming, etc.

aircooled_dot_net's is slick, it is a 4 wire O2 sensor, and he's got a lot
of good tips in the www add, you get 10% off, and thats all
real cool but some people may want to do it for less than $100.

For the inventive types again, the article at Pelican Parts is hard
to beat and give a little synopsis of how the O2 sensor behaves
and works.  More good info in the Bosch electrical systems handbook
or the Bentley Bosch FI handbook.

_monitor.htm

real slick they use the logarithmic display drivers to compensate for the
nonlinear O2 sensor curve, but it does take 20 LEDs which is hard
to mount.  I just used on on Steves and let the chips fall where they
may on the curve adjusting the endpoints so the LED's made good
sense.
