Subject: Brake backing plate removal

Hello

In the not too distant future I will have to replace my rear brake backing
plates.  Are there any special tools I will need for getting the stuff off
(apart from 46mm socket and big mutha cheater bar), like hub puller or
anything?  I was thinking of taking the wheel, hub and drum off as a unit,
is this a very silly idea?  It looks like it would be possible to assemble
the shoes etc onto the new backing plate on the bench rather than grovelling
in the dirt.  Is this an option?
