Subject: Re: [T2] Indigibus!!!

I'm sure Snoppy will give a complete report when he gets back, but how many
busses were there?  How did the activities go?  Was the campfire music
good?  Just wanting to hear more about this campout from those of you who
were there.  Thanks


&gt;Hello Gail and all, I was there also, the guy who drove the red chevy
&gt;s-10... My wife had the Vanagon, oh well I had a great time anyhow. I
&gt;was only able to stay sat night also as I had to get back to take care
&gt;of chores sunday morning. The phoenix ranch was really nice. We're
&gt;planning going back there some time. We're also looking forward to next
&gt;year. I also need to say thanks for the invite.

&gt;&gt; Got back yesterday afternoon from &quot;Indigibus&quot;. I only got to stay one
&gt;&gt; night,
&gt;&gt; but it was great!!!
&gt;&gt; Met a bunch of very nice people.  Took a few pics, which I will take the
&gt;&gt; time to review and post
&gt;&gt; later.
&gt;&gt; Thanks for the invitation, and looking forward to next year.
