The Haynes Vanagon Manual covers the fuel injection for this vechicle (as
well as the carb. non-US models) - It may be sufficient for your 79 Bay
as I think the two engines are nearly identical,  Another option would be
a fuel injection only manual that covers various Bosch F.I.  systems -
perhaps this is a better option.  Locally I can get a Haynes for under
$20.00 so it's not too expensive.  However if I add up all my manual
prices, well let's not.....

&gt;Hallo everybody,
&gt;  The other day i went to my local Pep Boy's, and got the Haynes manual.
 I 
&gt;have a 79, 2 litre FI engine that is all stock. The cover says...  &quot;VW 
&gt;Transporter  1700/1800/2000   1972 thru 1979 All Models.&quot;  My only
problem is 
&gt;that when i got home and opened it up, there was nothing about fuel 
&gt;injection.&gt;
