LOL!!

Guys, RK isn't gonna help with the wire.  I did it a long time ago when I
was so near sighted that I could have been considered legally blind
if it was'nt correctable(glasses)....before , I could see really good 
close  up, now I need glasses to see close up.

Oh, and you guys are still youngsters!  Wait till you add another 10 years
and see how it goes!

Bus content...nichrome wire is available at www.mcmaster_dot_com in .0031
and up diameters....at least I think it is the right kind...

Cheers, dave

&gt; Maybe, George..... after (a)  I find a source for .003&quot; nichrome wire and
&gt; (b) I get the radial keriotomy so I can SEE the wire and (c) I get a rig to
&gt; solder the new wire to the terrminals.  Crossing 50 means that even with the
&gt; reading glasses, I am more feeling the wire than seeing it.
