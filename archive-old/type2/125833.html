Subject: size of thread?

Why not go to Horrible Freight, buy a mike, and take the measurement?  If you 
buy the inch size, all you need is a little calculator and the knowledge that 1 
mm = 0.03937 in.  Much faster and easier than askingm everyone on the list, 
IMHO.  Here's one for 17 bucks....

PS: tell us where Kimberley is are located... maybe I can lend you taps and 
dies, also bought from Horrible Freight on promotion... huge set under $70.

.... I need to run a die over it to restore the threads but will need the 
exact size before my friend will lend it to me.  I think it's 17 or 18 mm  by 
1.0 mm (spacing).  Can anyone confirm this for me?
