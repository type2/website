&gt; I just bought an axle nut removal tool from J.C.Whitney. Since I haven't

&gt; The intended use is to remove the axle nut. On my bus, it is a 46mm
&gt; hexagonal nut torqued down &quot;helluva tight&quot; to over 250 Ft-Lb. You fit this

I have always used a good sized pipe wrench, never had any problems and
have never messed up the nut, but then my father was a plumber and he had
these humongous wrenches lying around everywhere and I was usually broke,
way back when I was a young pup

always worked so well that I have one in my bus toolbox.

Sneaky trick so you don't have to bang on em.  works best if you have a
slotted wheel.  
1. I don't take the wheel off the hub
2. put wrench on nut (cotter key removed)
3. large screw driver (or other similar BAT [big assed tool]
4. put screw driver in wheel slot and over(under) the wrench, apply
presure to screwdriver, which acts as a lever on the wrench, and no
forces are applied to the half shaft.

hasn't failed yet
