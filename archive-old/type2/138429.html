Subject: Re: [T2] ListServs and Pix

Hippo birdee 2 ewe! I noticed, but it didn't seem all that important. 
;o)


That being said, the best reason of all to keep pics off the list is 
that pics are attachments and users of the 97% solution would then be 
cluttering the list with &quot;I got a virused attachment in my T2 list 
mail.&quot;  This would then become a thread weeks long regarding the wisdom 
of opening unexpected attachments, followed by hundreds of posts 
directing those clueless enough to run barefoot through the ghetto to 
other clueless newbies favorite spyware installing &quot;free virus fixes.&quot; 
And on and on until the 97% solution users' machines are so screwed up 
that it takes &quot;professional&quot; help to get them back on line.

I admin three or four lists and am a member of long standing on about a 
dozen VW lists.  Not one of them allows attachments. I wonder why?

Steve (IIRC) and I run the 3% solution, so attachments are only a PITA, 
not the disaster that M$ users have to deal with.

You want attachments?  Start your own list.

Grumpily...

&gt; Well, I am sorry to say that pictures are not going to happen.  This is
&gt; not just because they don't belong in e-mail (THEY DON'T!) but because
&gt; they are incredibley expensive to send.  The problem is that with a 
&gt; list,
&gt; you have to multiply the number of bits sent in by 1,000-1,500 to get 
&gt; the
&gt; number of bits sent out.  Multiply that by 30-50 posts per day and the
&gt; numbers get ridiculous very quickly.

&gt; [1] I think we missed our ten-year aniversary, should have been held 
&gt; last
&gt; fall sometime.  Gerry Skerbitz, the man to blame for all of this 
&gt; started
&gt; the list some time in the fall of 1994.  I know I got on in January of 
&gt; '95
&gt; and the list was a going concenr by then.  TEN YEARS!!!  Damn... where 
&gt; did
&gt; the time go?
The first lemming to lead his peers off the cliff is a bold and 
decisive leader.
