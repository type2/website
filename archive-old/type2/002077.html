Yup, it's in Tennessee, headed toward Knoxville. It's currently in the hands
of Robert Cupp, who will pass it off to Chris Slaymaker, then it will head
to Chattanooga, and south into Georgia, before turning NE to the western tip
of SC, and into NC, before heading south again.

If you're in any of these areas and haven't signed up, be sure to head over
to the website and fill out the form so we can try to work you in. And if
you know of any clubs or organizations that include busses (any vintage)
that might want to participate, get them involved as well.

My thanks to all who have participated so far. The Tour is going great, and
it's all be cause of folks like those on this list.
