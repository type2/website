Subject: Re: Ammendment--Any one got an extra z-bed from a '74 or '75 to sell at a reasonable price?

Thanks for the info on the '74 and '75 Westy z-bed.

Does anybody  have a z-bed-seat from a '74 or '75 Westfalia to sell to
me?

Am I correct to also assume that the full width z-bed came in &quot;all&quot;
those Westies common on those years?  So that maybe, I could find one
around here?

My husband wants to make a bed for our van, in which we hope to travel
to alaska in about 2 months.  It would be alot of work and if I could
find a decent z-bed/seat to install, it would be alot quicker and less
trouble, even though the hubby would complain at the price, for sure. 
Unless I found one for  20 bucks or so...    ;=)

And yeah, we know about that cabinet--they really are in a bad place. 
We don't want to go whole hog camper, just a bed will be fine with us, a
bed that when it is in seat-mode looks like it belongs there.

 I don't know of a full width bed that is stock for the 68-71 series
(tho with VW's anything is possible and Chris may be on to something). 
OTOH (on the other hand) I *know* that the standard settup for 74 and 75
westies included a full width Z-bed, so if you want one, those are the
years to look for.  The one thing I advise *strongly* against is going
to the 68-73 westy settup.  The stock settup for those years includes 
full-height cabinet behind the passenger seat allong the reare quarter.
this cabinet creates a *huge* blind spot that IMHO is dead flat unsafe. 
I have a '73 and call it the &quot;suicide cabinet&quot;.
