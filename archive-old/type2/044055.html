Listees,

I am curious to know what you think about the oil temp guage versus the 
cylinder head temp guage. What are your opinions?

Thanks
Ethan    &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

Best to do as listee David Schwarze does, get both. I have the oil temp gauge 
and watch it all the time. However on a 9000 mile trip from Florida to LA to 
Oregon to Wisconsin to Florida where I met up with David to go to the big bus 
campout in Aridzona in 1998 he always made me jealous my comparing his head 
temp to his oil temp (he has a sensor between both heads and a switch to a 
gauge). 

When traveling with David always wear a clean shirt................
