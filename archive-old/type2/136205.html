Subject: Re: [T2] how long will my motor likely last  then? Great ideas

Great info and wonderful idea.  My female intuition is
not to put $ into cosmetics just yet.  I'm doing about
20,000 miles per year so holding off for a rebuilt
motor is my priority.  Wish I could afford to do both
at the same time.  Love that concept.

&gt; But you mention a paint job: it's a nice idea to
&gt; have your paint done 
&gt; in one place and redo your engine in another and
&gt; then bring them all 
&gt; together for bliss.
