Subject: Re: [T2] Cheap door seals from CIP

&gt; &lt;&lt;My old seals were shot so these will be better no matter what. There
&gt; were a few possible ways to deal with the top corners. -stay on the
&gt; round part and glue
&gt; -cut and bevel the top corners and stay at the edge (best I think)
&gt; -stretch and glue around the top corners (what i did)&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; There is no way I'd be cutting the new door seals.
&gt;
&gt; I would however heat them up using a  heat gun to help them conform to
&gt; the radius of the corner's of the doors.
&gt; Then quickly glue them down.

No need for heat guns in miami in the middle of april in the afternoon.
I do think it would have been better to cut the corners still and I dont
think they would have seperated after being glued with the weatherstrip
adhesive.
