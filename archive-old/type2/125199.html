Subject: Re: [T2] re: 1700 HEAD QUESTION

NO, these are NOT EGR ports. They are the air injection ports.
 
Two TOTALLY different emission systems.

EGR puts exhaust INTO the intake ports to lower combustion temps to lower NOX emissions.

Air injection put fresh air INTO the exhaust ports to lower HC output. 


&gt; The extra ports on the heads, if I'm guessing right at what you're
describing, are indeed emissions-related - part of the EGR (exhaust gas
recirculation system that was present on some dual-carb T-IV engines of
the early 70's. 
 
Some motors have four EGR ports, some have three. My 1800 has three ports
(two on the 3/4 side, one on the 1/2 side). If you have removed all the
EGR components (air pump, filter, EGR valves, etc), those ports can be
plugged. Valve adjuster screws work nicely for this purpose.
