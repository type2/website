&gt; 1. Need to smog till 2008

As long as you have all the emission control parts installed, you 
should have no trouble passing smog.  My '76 FI passed with flying 
colors.  I did have to install a new EGR filter and cat, though (the 
EGR filter was missing, and it is visually inspected during the test, 
and with the old, hollowed-out cat that was installed, it came close to 
NOT passing, according to the pre-test I had done at my mechanic's 
shop).

I suspect that it will do even better once I install my new Pertronix 
pointless ignition, due to more complete burning of the fuel/air 
mixture.  Doesn't a '79 come stock with pointless ignition?
