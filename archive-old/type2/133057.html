Guys,

Set mine up Monday afternoon in the back yard in preparation for
a camput this weekend...nice to know how to put it up *before* you get to 
the campgrounds.

It is a *very* nice tent. My only worry is that the inside part with the 
floor will not be big enough for me(I am 6' 4&quot;)...I forgot to try it out
as the wife was hot to get it packed back up so she could mow the lawn.

It sure looks waaay cool hooked up to the bus though.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; I am really happy with this tent, it's easily one of the nicest-built
&gt; tents I've ever owned, and I've been camping for a long time. It
&gt; definitely holds its own against anything I've had from Woods, Coleman
&gt; or Eureka, it packs away in a small and lightweight package that iss
&gt; huge when set up.  It's really a great addition to our camper, and
&gt; can't wait for our next camping trip.
&gt; 
&gt; Happy trails,
&gt;
