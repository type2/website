AFAIK this isn't so; they're both 5 inches.
 
&gt; anyone know for sure which way this is or how to tell the
&gt; difference?

Measure (obviously), or look for the stamped inscriptions
close to the centre, under the hubcap.  On older rims,
a wire brush might come handy for that purpose.

Airhowlingly yours,
