Subject: [T2] RE: heat - how long propane

Someone asked how long propane would last with a 12000 BTU burner.
Your typical gas BBQ is around 45000 BTU and a tank lasts many hours?
So figure the burner can run three times as long as your BBQ. However
the burner in the furnace is probably  only on 1/5 of the time you have
the bus furnace on?
