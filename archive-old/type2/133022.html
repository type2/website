Subject: Re: [T2] Belly Pan Question

Guys,

Over the years, this has been discussed and I think the consensus was that 
belly pans went on all busses that had part of the roof cut out...to help 
stiffen the frame.

Obviously, a westy should have a belly pan unless it has an A/C.

The A/C condenser has to go someplace and the only place we could
figure out where to put it was under the belly....got to have lots of air 
flow...like in a watercooled car, it goes in front ofthe radiator.

THe heater on the other hand, was installed between the flooring and the 
belly pan...at least the pics that I have seen showed it that way.

Hope that helps, dave
