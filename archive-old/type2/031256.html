&gt;  Hello!!! I am new to this list, and I just had a question. I am
&gt; fortunate enough to have &quot;adopted&quot; a 1973 bus, about a month ago. It is
&gt; automatic. The tranny is shifting great, (original) but if someday I
&gt; would have problems with it, is it hard to find parts for the automatic

for the older vacuum shift automatics (73-75) hen's teeth are easier to
find than parts, if you find a tranny for sale grab it and store it.

the newer 76+ auto trannies with the govenor shift are easier to find
parts for and to find in general, but still the auto tranny was less than
10% of the buses

&gt; other question is, can I drop a 2.0 Vanagon aircooled engine into the
&gt; 1973?? Would I have to use larger carbs?? It still has the original

the 2 liter engine would not have the vacuum port for the tranny but it
could be made and the vacuum tranny shift points are adjustable... my
suggestion is if you can get the 2l engine get the fuel injection system
too and go that route

Bob
