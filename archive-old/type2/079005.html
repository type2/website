Play it on a computer and use ZAPGRAB (small computer utility that is free 
and wonderful) to take a snapshot (copy and paste) of the screen (or 
whatever portion of it) and paste it into a document of any format.


&gt;PS how do you get a digital picture off a DVD?
&gt;I could put the telly into pause &amp; take a picture of the screen but that does
&gt;not sound too good!
