Subject: Ignition switch removal on '71 ; one answer and one question (long)

On 71 SC, had failed ign switch...pin 15.. several months ago, which I
jumpered to work around...this week the switch wouldn't crank the engine
over. Read the archives..thanks to Bob Wallace particularly, for the very
helpful inputs.

Spent 2 entire days...!!!... finding that hidden spring hole that lets you
release the keying mechanism from its cylinder. One day of that was with the
whole thing sitting in my lap in an easy chair. This was the most
frustrating thing..by far..that I've done, including engine rebuild, whole
brake system replacements, drive axles etc, since resuming the VW crazies
2-3 years ago. For those who haven't done it..it is no walk in the park: at
least not on the 71.

FINALLY got that POS apart by drilling a hole in the correct position
(preceeded by many in the wrong place). IMHO, you're best off drilling that
one correctly placed hole in order to be able to depress the release spring.
The hole in which the spring resides was NOT reachable by an L-shaped
wire..or a U-shaped one as posted..at least on this bone stock 71 vehicle.

I spent many hours on the archives..but if the following has been
posted....point me to it and excuse the bandwidth:

I plan on having made, 3 or so close up/clear photos of where the hole
should be drilled for access to the release spring..and will then post it
for reference. This combined with the posts already up..should save you a
lot of hours on this model..and prolly the range of at least 68-72..and
maybe further. I think the hole is a great time saver even if you have a
spare cylinder in hand to help you locate the pesky spring hole...mine was
just not reachable, even when I'd become pretty sure where it was, til I
drilled where you could get a fairly straight shot at it. And in the area
required...there is very little danger of damaging anything during the
drilling.
An added benifit to the hole, is that you can remove the barrell...for
changing a key, eg, without having to do anything else as in the Bentley
procedures: unless you have electrical problems..as I did...of course. I
THINK that is true. If you know differently, say so. But be gentle..I'm
freakin' tired.

Only pics I found of drlling a hole was in (cover your eyes Karl) the
Chilton book..and they were for the wrong model. In any case, I'll try to
post these soon. If they're already here and I missed them..let me know. And
I'll kill myself.

Okay, question:

On the electrical plug piece..where my #15 pin gets no juice..appears that
the cylindrical plastic piece is 2 part and can be taken apart for maybe a
cheap fix...I hope, hope, hope. If so, how do you get it apart? (I've lost
confidence in figuring out anything other than, say, adding a quart of oil).

Also, how do you get the wires out of the end of that piece for either
replacing a wire, or replacing the plug itself?

Also, though I'll check BD, anyone have a source for this plug?

What else is lurking in the weeds of this never-to-be-repeated job? (I'll
part out my cherry SC first!)

Thanks, Marv Krupp; weary..and not a hell of a lot wiser..

PS The no-crank problem was because the grub-screw that holds the electrical
plug snug, had loosened..and a VERY slight shift in the plug caused no
contact,,so no juice for crank. (at least one free fix :)
