Volks,

While I was installing the Mercedes Benz front axle nuts that Karl sent
me, I took a bunch of pictures, a couple of which came out :-)  I have
posted them in a basic gallery at:

http://www.type2_dot_com/dworkin/axlenut2/

I highly recommend this replacement!  I believe it will be far more secure
than the original VW peen nut.  Even if you own a bay, I recommend looking
at the page because the structure of the front axle stub did not change
that much. If you ever need to get in to yours, the comments on removing
the dust cover should be helpful.

As a side not, at this point, I believe I own at least one of ever variety
of locking pliers that Vice-Grip makes.   And I have used all of them
extensively on my various buses!  The Model 12LC shown was originally
bought to remove the clamp on the anti-sway bar, but serves a multitude of
other purposes :-)
