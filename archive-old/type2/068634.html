Subject: Re: Fuel Injection, looking for book
&gt;&gt;Are there any good books on the early van (79) fuel injection.  Something
&gt;&gt;along the lines of,&quot;fuel injection for the complete idiot&quot;, or,&quot;FI for
&gt;&gt;dummies&quot;.

&gt;There's a Bosch-specific book which covers the gamut of Bosch fuel
&gt;injection. &quot;Bosch Fuel Injection and Engine Management&quot; or something like 
&gt;that.

That is the correct title.  It's a Bentley publication.  While I wouldn't 
quite call it an &quot;idiot guide,&quot; it does have two full chapters on F.I. 
basics and theory. Also some very useful troubleshooting flowcharts, 
service info, and even a section on high-performance mods. Covers all FI 
systems used by VW, plus other European makes. 
I sell this manual by mail for $24. (Or you can get it from any Bentley 
dealer, somewhere between $30 and $35, I think.)
