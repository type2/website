Subject: Oil Pump on 1700

Well I finally settled with FedEx and their damaging of some P/Cs I bought. 
Now I can finally order some new ones..well when the check comes in. I 
started looking through the disassembled parts. The oil pump is odd. It 
appears to be more like one from an upright engine instead of the normal 
Type IV oil pump. Has anyone ever seen one like that on a Type IV engine? I 
will post pics later when I get home. But I remember it having a flat cover 
plate not the normal one with the ears to pry against. I do not remember 
using a puller to get it out. Loose fit. I have some spares and will be 
replacing it with on of those, but I thought I would ask anyone has run 
across these before.

Thnaks,
