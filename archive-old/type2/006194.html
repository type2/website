section of my 72.  I tried every different size metric bolt I could find,
but in the end a 3/8 bolt fit the best.  I still haven't figured out what
the bolt holes are really for

Dan, to kill time at the comm. coll. welding class I'm taking, I just
started on a similar hitch for my T2's using the same holes (Camper holes
are empty..will put bolts through them..SC has tapped holes). I can
determine the metric cap bolt size that fit mine if you like.

 Have finished the hanger plates only..could you possibly post your plans
somewhere..or p-mail if more suitable. That way I can quit wasting my own
limited cells on the rest of the design. Plan on puling occasional KG or
type3..not here in the mountains, of course. If that doesn't work out, bet I
can at least pull the makings for one heck-ava tailgate party.

Regards, Marv Krupp..who has a new MIG he never turns off...
