&gt; just bought bus, one thing knocked back on roadworthy certicifcate 
&gt; for was exhaust.
&gt; 
&gt; Fairly rusty in larger part and then pipe at end is crumbling away. 
&gt; Do i have to replace whole exhaust? If yes, i guess it involves 
&gt; welding so it will have to be done by some professional? i have 
&gt; basic welding skills though, and are short of cash.
 
What year is your bus??

Where are you?
