Subject: 75 Refrigerator Works!!

I would like to thank Bob Pell on the list who said turn your fridge over a
couple times over a couple of days because that has been part of the
cure for my 75 Campmobile.  I had a proffesional check this out and
when all was said and done with a brand new deep sell battery it cost
me $175.  Yes I should have done this myself but I just wanted to be
safe and now I know what to do in the future.  Not terrible, and it was a
birthday present for myself.  A question I have is that RV guy assumes
that the majority of the accesories run off of the auxillary battery when
the bus is not running or the key is not in the ignition.  Is this true, I
thought everyone on the list indicated an isolator wasneeded to be set
up for this to be true.  If so I will do that myself.  So all you guys out there
without working fridges, check the coils to see if they are in good shape
and burp that puppy by turing it over a couple of times over a couple of
days.  The reason these clog is because they are operated on unlevel
ground.  He said it doesn't matter when you are driving but when you are
stopped. 

Hope this helps, and I know that the little fridge doesn't work that great
but I wanted everything to work.  For all of you out there with faulty sink
pumps I suggest a foot pump.  Mine works great and requires zero
electricity.
