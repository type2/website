Subject: exhaust questions

One of my parts on my 78 type 2 exhaust broke.  I need heater boxes 
anyway and am thinking of retrofitting to a 72-74 exhaust system.  Has 
anyone done this mod.  do all the parts fit up right.  is there any 
fabrication involved.  I was going to have my mechanic put this on but 
he is not going to want to do any modifications.  do all the heating 
channels line up right. 
It seems that the 74 system would have an advantage over the 78 system 
for heat.  In the 78 the exhaust runs through some naked pipe before it 
gets to the exchangers and it would seem that the 74 system would have 
hotter exhaust air running through it.  Is there any more heat produced 
by the one system rather then the other?  My exhaust manifolds are good 
and I could keep the original system if I wanted but have been thinking 
about this for a month.
