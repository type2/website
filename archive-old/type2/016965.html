&gt; &gt; Volks,
&gt; &gt; While back on this forum, I asked about mufflers, for 1500 engine, &amp;
&gt; &gt; people told me German made was the way to go, so finally today I go
&gt; to a
&gt; &gt; couple of my VW parts suppliers and they both tell me, you can't buy
&gt; German
&gt; &gt; made anymore.  They were wanting to sell me Brazillian ones.
&gt; 
&gt; Simple, most people shop for price, so the cheaper Brazilian mufflers
&gt; have pushed the German parts from your supplier's shelves.  It's too
&gt; costly to stock parts for which there is low demand.
&gt; 
&gt; Since he doesn't stock German mufflers anymore, he can't sell them to
&gt; you.  He therefore tells you a &quot;fib&quot;, saying that German mufflers
&gt; aren't available, in the hope that you'll jump on the Brazilian cheapo
&gt; bandwagen and give him some business.
&gt; 
&gt; The solution is to change suppliers.  I just got a nice Leisteritz
&gt; muffler, made in May of 1998, complete with &quot;Made in Germany&quot; stamped
&gt; into the metal.
&gt; 
&gt; (Hmmm: Why does a German company stamp that in English?)
&gt; 
&gt; I got it from Bus Depot, and the price wasn't bad at all.  Once you've
&gt; wrestled a Mexican or Brazilian muffler into position you will be more
&gt; than willing to go to the trouble to find the correct German part!
&gt; The difference in quality and fit is amazing!

George:
I agree- and one more thing: Germans, all northen Europeans, suffer the
effects of winter and salted roads and rust just like those of us list
members in the Rust Belt, USA. Consequently German repair parts and
exhaust parts in particular, last really well in less than ideal
conditions. Brazillian mufflers, for me would last as little as 6
months; German, 3 or 4 years. Not a lab-controlled test, but a LOT
longer!
