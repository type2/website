Subject: Brake Warning Light

Hello Everyone-
On my Grey '72 Bus I've been getting the red dash light indicating brake
problems. I replaced the master cylinder last summer and have always been
on the look out for leaks and have seen none. In the past my rear brakes
would go out of adjustment because the clickers on the star adjusters have
broken off and the brake adjustments don't hold. This would cause the brake
lite to go on but re-adjusting the brakes would fix it. This time the
adjustment didn't work. The light still goes on when I depress the pedal.
I'm not sure I'm going to find a leak, if I do that will be the answer.
Could worn pads all around cause this? What else should I look for other
than leaks?  By the way, the brakes seem to be working just fine.
The 72 rear brakes are one of the &quot;in between&quot; years and brake parts are
rare. Does anyone know if I could replace the rear adjusters completely
with another year part?
Any Ideas ?

Thank you.
