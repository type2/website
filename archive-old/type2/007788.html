Hello All --
Being a Riviera owner, I had to insert my 2 cents.  I too am very very
happy with mine.  When I set out looking for a bus I was thinking &quot;German
or nothing&quot; as I focused on Westys.  The first one I looked at was what I
thought was a Westy (naive me) but was actually a 78 Riviera.  I was
immediately struck by the simplicity and funkiness of its inner
practicality.  (Suspicious compression and my desire to stay with things
German scared me off.)  The next 2 were Westys (77 &amp; 78 Deluxe), both of
which were beautiful but overwhelming with all the stuff they had in there,
overkill if you will -- I felt that if I bought one I would never get
around to using all the bells &amp; whistles (being a BBQ man, I knew the
propane stove would get no usage) and didn't want to regret shelling out
the dough.  (Again, suspicious compression on both scared me away.)  The
4th &amp; final look was at a 79 Riviera and again I liked its interior, roomy
top/bottom beds (sleeps 4 adults easy), closets, electric fridge, internal
water system, serious head room with the top up (I have tall friends) and
all-around funkiness (as opposed to the &quot;quirkiness&quot; of Westys).  I bought
it and it is perfect for what I wanted it for: reliabilty and fun as both
my daily driver and my weekend/vacation road trip and camping machine.  I'm
sure most Westy owners feel the same about theirs.  Whatever the case,
we're all sitting on top of VW busses and they all have the same heart and
character no matter what angle the pop top pops.
