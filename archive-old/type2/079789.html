Subject: Very Intermittent Loss of Power

Dear All Knowing List,

I've been lurking in the List's Digest for about a year and thoroughly enjoy 
the great knowledge and pleasant discourse. You've all given me confidence 
to keep my 82 Vanagon running well for over 2 years.  Thanks.

But here's my issue:
My bus experiences very intermittent losses of power - on the order of maybe 
7 times in the last 6 months.

Symptoms:
It's happened at both city and highway driving speeds.  Typically I'm just 
cruising along (30/40 city, 55-60 highway) and then it suddenly losses power 
- BUT doesn't stall out (not red lights on dash).  I can keep it running by 
putting the accelerator to the floor - but my speed slowly drops off.  When 
this happens, I look to move to the shoulder (hoping no one will rear end 
me!).  As I slow - releasing the clutch and braking (thus taking my foot off 
the gas) the engine dies (all red lights on in dash - no surprise I guess).  
So far - it has never regained power after it began to loose power.

After I stop, I turn the ignition off, sit for about 30 seconds, then try to 
restart it.  It has always restarted and idled like it had no idea what just 
happened.  Reving the engine while parked acts and sounds completely normal. 
  From here - I usually drive away without another incident for a few weeks.

My info:  I've got a stock engine except for the Pertronix unit.  Oil temp, 
oil press, and cylinder head temp (under #3 plug) sensors and guages are 
installed.  Cylinder head temps vary between 325 to 425.  Oil Press (hot) is 
25 psi running, 8-10 psi idle.  Oil temps 180 - 220.  All seem to indicate 
completely normal and properly timed operation.

I've tried:
1)Replacing the fuel filter
2)Basic troubleshooting and component checks on Coil, Temp Sensor II, 
Rotor/Cap - all resistance and continuity checks met the Bently 
requirements.

From Archive Info on the topic of power loss it seems that I'm having a 
problem with either my fuel pump, AFM, a foreign object in my fuel tank 
(ugh!), or a very wierd Temp Sensor II thing.  It acts like it's fuel or air 
is being restricted - however when everything is turned off and it's 
restarted - the problem is corrected.

So...is there a way for me to isolate the problem to either the fuel or air 
delivery systems?  Would any of the AFM tests find a problem spot on the 
wiper resistor thing?

I'm about to just swap the fuel pump out to see if the problem goes away - 
but the pump is kind of expensive - and I don't like the shotgun approach to 
vehicle repair.  I also think that a fuel pump problem would result in short 
pressure problems that go away on their own - without having to turn the 
ignition off.  This makes me wonder about the AFM and/or a temporary bad 
signal from the Temp Sensor II - I might be able to see that cycling the 
power to this system could 'reset' it.

Thanks for reading this far!
