More information from a Type3 page.  I guess MT1 means manual transmission?

Notes about fluids

Standard VW Type 3 Transaxle
        GL-4

Automatic VW Type 3 Transaxle:
        GL-5 for the Differential
        Dexron I, II or III ATF (or Mercon) for the Transmission
Use synthetic whenever possible!

Additional notes:
Since we were getting a variety of opinions on the GL-4 vs GL-5 debate, I 
emailed Bob Hoover. Here is his response:

&gt; Dear Jim, et al
&gt; 
&gt; Volkswagen used to use BRONZE syncho rings.  Bronze is an alloy of copper and
&gt; TIN.
&gt; 
&gt; In one of their many 'improvements' Volkswagen went to a cheaper BRASS 
&gt; synchro ring.  Brass is an alloy of copper and ZINC.
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately, in trying to save a penny or so per synchro, VW decided to use an
&gt; alloy of brass that contained a significant percentage of aluminum.
&gt; 
&gt; Then along came GL-5 tranny lube, which contained a new anti-oxidant, 
&gt; supposed to allow you to extend the replacement period of the oil, which was
&gt; fine for differentials and steel gears and even for the older BRONZE synchros
&gt; but pure hell on those new, improved, save-a-penny aluminum-copper-zinc
&gt; synchros.  
&gt; 
&gt; Bottom line:  GL-5 caused the newer synchros to 'honey-comb.'   I don't 
&gt; recall the half-page explanation but GL-5 attacked the zinc in the synchros and
&gt; they would break.  So VW issued a Service Bulletin telling all of their dealers
&gt; to NOT use GL5 on transmissions manufactured after a given date (about 1967, as
&gt; I recall... which I don't, all that clearly).
&gt; 
&gt; So use GL-4.  Or make sure your tranny is rebuilt using the old style BRONZE
&gt; sychros.
&gt; 
&gt; I've never paid much attention to this problem because I've still got most of a
&gt; 37 gal drum of  GL-4 tranny lube, plus a box full of old synchro rings. 
&gt; (Replacement of the synchros is a relatively minor chore, compared to replacing
&gt; a gear set.)
&gt;
&gt; You'll have to answer the synthentic lubricant question yourself.  When I run
&gt; out of tranny lube eight or ten years from now, I might look into the use of
&gt; synthetics but having no need to do so, it is a non-issue to me.  Sorry I can't
&gt; be of more help.

...but wait, here's more!...

&gt; To add my 2 cents worth... Bob Hoover is quite right, the first GL5
&gt; standard is slightly corrosive to the bronze in VW gearboxes when it's
&gt; hot.
&gt;
&gt; Once the oil companies discovered this, they improved the GL5 standard
&gt; to GL5-MTI (VW aren't the only gearboxes to have bronze components),
&gt; which is NOT corrosive to VW gearboxes and is quite safe to use.
&gt;
&gt; GL3 and GL4 standards are quite OK too.
&gt;
&gt; The normal VW gearbox oil is 85w90 or 80w90 Hypoid.  The 80w90 is
&gt; better if you live in an area of snowy winters - it will make for
&gt; smoother gearchanges on cold mornings.
&gt;
&gt; The Synthetic gearbox oils are often 75w90, and this is fine too -
&gt; making for even smoother changes on cold mornings.  So long as it's
&gt; GL5-MT1 and NOT the original GL5 standard.

&gt;This is a good piece of info you found re GL5-MT1. I hope this is the
&gt;straight goods, there is so much confusing and contradictory info out there
&gt;about this gear lube. I'll look for MT1. Tom
