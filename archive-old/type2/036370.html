Subject: VW Hall sender

&gt;&gt;Hi, Does anyone have any experience with the 79 bus hall sender standard for
that year. I saw it in the VW parts manual. If it fits into a 78 distributor
would this not be a good substitute to a pertronix? VW quality at the same
price. What I would like to know is if this sender requires another
component to function or if it will function alone like the pertronix does.&lt;&lt;

Bob:

AFAIK, the hall ignition came only on '79 and up california emissions
busses and vanagons.  I'm not positive, but I'd bet you would need the hall
distributor if you wanted to convert to the VW hall ingnition.  You would
also need the special bosch coil along with the control module that mounts
on the firewall, oh and there is the wiring harness that goes between the
distributor and the control module.  Other than that, its a pretty sweet
setup, but these parts can be difficult to find.  If you want to eliminate
your points (and the frequent need for adjustment and retiming) the easiest
and most cost effective way is probably the Pertronix ignitor.
