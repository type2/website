Hello All.

I've just bought a Kombi camper (actually a Dormobile conversion)
with my girlfriend.  Its a '76 2L twin carb. (Australian spec)

I pulled the air filter off my '76 2L twin carb yesterday (first time) and
had a look around.

I discovered a few interesting (and strange!) things.

1. All of the temperature control insulation aside from one spark plug cover
seems to be okay - that is tinware, spark plug covers, foam strip around
engine.

2. The vaccuum hose from the fuel mixture lines to the air filter has split
in two. Instead of repairing it, the PO plugged it with a drill bit!!!!!

3. On the left hand side duct (to the carb) has a fitting on the bottom of
it. It looks a litle like:
________
&lt; || || &gt;

where the two || are pipes, and the &lt; and &gt; are clip things of some sort -
whats this for? Is something supposed to connect to it?

4. The LH carb had the choke valve all the way open all the time (ie
vertical). I tried to turn it to the closed position by hand, but it stopped
after moving about 20degrees..._dot_come to think of it, maybe I was trying to
push it the wrong way???  What do I need to look at to correct this??

  I have only run the bus from cold 3 times: The day I bought it - it was
great.  A couple of days later - it was stalling unless I revved it - it got
better when it warmed up, and again today, when I was running the engine to
keep it moving and charge the battery a little.  It was running very rough
unless I gave it a significant amount of reving - it got better as it warmed
up (I wasn't driving anywhere - only parked).  Ambient temperature is about
10 degrees centigrade, give or take about 3 deg. c (sorry - no idea in F).
I hope that this is caused by the vaccum line and the choke being right
open?

5. I could not see fuel leaking, but was told by a pre purchase inspection
that it was..from both carbs...how can I tell if there is a fuel leak will I
clearly see fuel?

Thanks,

John Adams
