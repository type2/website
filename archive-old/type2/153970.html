Subject: Removing hubcaps

Hi Folks,

Some say there are no stupid questions.  Well, try this one.  It's quite
embarrassing for a guy who's been hanging around VWs for 15 years.

I've been working on a '71 (rather than my '70), and it has the later wheels
and hubcaps.  Whereas my moon hubcaps pop off easily (sometimes at 50mph on
the highway), I'm having a devil of a time getting the cap off the wheel
sitting as a spare on the front bracket.  I don't have a stock puller for the
pairs of holes, but I would have thought that the old screwdriver in the joint
method would work.  Nothing.  That cap is stuck tight.  And it looks like some
PO has tried that, because the hub is scratched up there.  I plan to try
progressively bigger crewdrivers and pry bars, but before I risk further
damage, is there some trick that everyone else knows but me.

Not so blissfully ignorant,
Jerry
