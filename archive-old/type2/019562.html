The same thing was happening to my bus... I looked for months for the solution
(I just worked on the bus a few hours a week...). The engine would turn, but
there was no power to the injectors. I checked everything on the bus, borrowed
an ECU, with no results, It turned ou to be a pulled out wire inside the
harness plug at the ECU.

Good luck

&gt; hey list,
&gt;
&gt; you may remember me as the guy whose fan fell of his crankshaft of his
&gt; rebilt AVP block (2L type4, hyd. lifters, FI). since then i've had the
&gt; crankshaft replaced at a local shop to the tune of $670. I've got the engine
&gt; in the bus and it won't start now.
&gt;
&gt; I've set the timing (with light while cranking), i've checked my hoses, i've
&gt; got fuel, i've got spark. the engine is firing when i crank it, but won't
&gt; catch and run. i've got white smoke from the tailpipe while cranking. i've
&gt; checked connections to the AFM, ECU, FI grounds to case, etc. i've already
&gt; run the battery down twice trying to start it and check various things, and
&gt; i'm stumped.
&gt;
&gt; does white smoke mean excess fuel?? should i advance the timing a little??
&gt;
&gt; stumped,
