&gt; Sawz all is the way to go if you don't have a plasma cutter. A torch can do

&gt; a trick once and it cut like butter. Just have a lot of blades handy. I have a
&gt; plasma cutter now, but even that has its down side if their is anything that
&gt; can catch fire.

it's amazing what a Sawzall will cut, in removing a front quarter I
couldn't get the windshield out, it was broke anyway so I just cut the
thing with the Sawzall...no power use the hammer and axe system.....
