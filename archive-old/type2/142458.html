&gt;What is the purpose of the vac hose that goes over to the air cleaner?
&gt;
&gt;I started looking at the diageam at www.ratwell_dot_com and realized mine was 
&gt;different!  No hose to air cleaner from the distributor tees.

The vacuum advance is connected to the air cleaner on FI buses to open the EEC valve. This valve is closed at idle so the fumes stored in the charcoal canister aren't introduced to the intake. When there is a vacuum signal the fumes are let in.
