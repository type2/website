Subject: Why VW buses die

My husband is tearing down the blown engine that we brought back from =
Coeur d' Alene, Idaho.. I go out and look or help from time to time when =
he is working on it. We got the cylinders off, and I looked in the =
number four cylinder hole and saw a broken crank grinning back at me.. =
busted clean in two. The engine didn't look like it had a whole lotta =
miles on it. Someone had rebuilt it not far back. The plug wires were =
melted on the ends, and that was the first clue that it had been =
overheated badly. Well, this is the case with two pressure relief =
valves. We're hoping the case will be salvageable. Hubby just opened =
them, an almost Herculean task, maybe because someone had glued them =
shut? There were springs in there, but no pistons for the pressure =
relief valves. Both of them were disabled. If ever there was an argument =
for an oil pressure guage, there it is. This thing must have had zero =
oil pressure, right?
In the glove box, we found a receipt for service from a tractor repair =
company. Remember, this is northern Idaho. Probably not many good VW =
mechanics for hire up there. We heard it was driven in, making a helluva =
racket. D'ya think?=20
A friend just came out from Kansas for a wedding. His mom had a Westy =
pop-top camper until it blew the engine, and they couldn't find a good =
VW mechanic out there, so sold it for a song. Neither could work on it =
and had no tools. Luckily, someone bought it who knew how to work on VWs =
or was willing to learn, and they still see it running up and down the =
roads out there. But it seems that's what it takes.. These are tinkerers =
cars. They'll take a lot of abuse, but they need someone who understands =
air-cooled engines. A lot of buses would still be on the road today if =
not for their drivers and ignorant or sloppy mechanics.    Jan B
