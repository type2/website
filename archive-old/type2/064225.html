Subject: Re: random parts i really want

&gt; Usually when i decellerate(sp.) i can hear a little bit of backfire from
the
&gt; engine, almost like pop-corn but not just the average sound of a vw

&gt;From my experience this is usually a small hole (can be very small) in the
muffler (sometimes exhaust manifold).  Find it now and patch it or it will
get bigger _fast_!
