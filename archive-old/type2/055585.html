Subject:      Bright/Dim lights

      HI All,

     I thought I didn't have any bright lights on my '69 either.
   After a lot of dinking around under the dash and tracing
   the wiring I figured out that the problem was a ground wire
   that attaches to some tabs on the body near the wiper motor.
   I tried dismantling the relay first, but that was futile. :(
   The moral of this story...it's not always the power source.
