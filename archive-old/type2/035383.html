Go over the 13mm bolts holding the end castings to the heads. Are they tight? How about the intake manifold boots, are
the boots seated properly and the screw holding the brackets all the way closed? Do you have that small vacuum port on
the left end casting and is it plugged up? Do you have any other ports running off the intake manifold center unit below
the
carb, such as a large port for an optional brake booster on the left side? If you have power assist and the hose is
there, it should be suspected of leaks. If it's not there but you have a port - make sure it's sealed up good. Are you
using an 009?
If so, make sure the ports on your 30.3 are all plugged up too.

Recheck the valves, point gap &amp; make sure you're in the ballpark with the timing. Make sure all four plugs are firing.

Run the motor and keep it going with your hand on the cam
while you spray wd-40 around the base of the carb where it meets the intake - does the idle smooth out for a couple
seconds when hit with spray? If so, replace the carb base gasket. Do the same in other suspected leak areas.

If none of this changes your problem and you feel confident about the carb rebuild you did, take a moment to wiggle the
throttle shaft on the carb - does it move noticeably ? it might be to worn to hold an idle and then you need to send it
to mofoco
to get it rebushed or do it yourself with the elusive kit.

Ultimately I would then run compression test on that motor you recently installed, because if your compression is low in
one
cylinder, you can screw around with the carb until what was deluxe becomes debris, and never get the thing dialed in.
