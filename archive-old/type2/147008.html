Subject: Re: [T2]age old question(OIL)

Hmmm- I have the meat thermometer on the 30 wt oil and a pressure gauge; 
I can watch the pressure drop like a stone from 55 to 30 when the valve 
opens at 190 deg F.

  The oil viscosity does have something to do with cooling.  Thicker oil
  doesn't pass through the oil cooler as readily, causing the bypass valve
  to open and allow oil to go directly to the gallery.  This promotes faster
  oil warmup, which is a good thing.  However, thicker oil will actually
  cause the bypass valve to remain open to a higher temperature, which
  might have a negative effect on cooling.

  Is this an issue?  The only way to find out is to monitor the position of
  the bypass valve.  If it is fully closed at 150F with SAE 50 oil then it
  probably isn't, but if it is partially open at 250F with the same oil then
  the oil might actually promote overheating by allowing the cooler to be
  bypassed!
