My two cents -- get the body panel yourself. The body shop's liable to
get ya big time if they order it themselves. They'll order it from VW or
something (just because they may not know any better) and you'll pay a
fortune.

My insurance company originally quoted $900 for a used nose skin, and I
can get the same thing from Bus Depot for $139 plus shipping (~$80).

&gt; I've got leads on some decent local
&gt; body shops, but here's my question for those of you who've been in
&gt; similar situations:  should I try to acquire the replacement body panels
&gt; and such myself, or let the shop do it?  It looks like RMMW (and
&gt; therefore probably Bus Depot) have what I'll need.  Any help or
&gt; suggestions are welcome.
