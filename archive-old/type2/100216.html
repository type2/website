Subject: quality body panels

  Was wondering if anyone can give me some advice on purchasing body panels? 
  I am replacing some of the metal on my 69 this spring, and wanted to find 
some good quality body panels.  I don't want JC Whitney rust out in a month, 
thin as tinfoil stuff.  I live in Vermont, and the salt is not friendly.  I 
was not planning on driving during the winter, but 1 vehicle right now.  I 
looked at a few parts dealers, but none seem to have too much info.  Any 
suggestions?
