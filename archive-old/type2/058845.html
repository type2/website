Subject: Re: winter storage

&gt; My bus (1972 Safare) will probably be stored outside under a paved
car port (Montreal, Canada) for the next 12 months or so (maybe
longer). Should I put it on blocks to raise the wheels off the ground,
or should I overinflate the tires to about 60 psi?

Put it up on  secure blocks, back the rear brake shoes away from the
drums a bit via the adjusters, and _don't_ set the emergency brake! 
Drop the tire pressure to 20 psi or so, and cover the tires to prevent
sun-rot.

Remove the battery to a non-freezing location.  Don't leave it on
concrete (for some obscure religious reason) and arrange to have it
trickle-charged every couple of months.  

Empty the fuel tank and carburator, change the oil, put a couple of
tablespoons of oil in each spark plug hole, and rotate the engine a
few turns.

Seal the exhaust, intake, and breather tube with tape.  Purists will
put some packets of silica gel (like you get with electronic
equipment) inside of these openings while sealing them.  If you do,
make sure that they will come out when you unseal the openings!  The
silica gel trick works nicely for the gas tank too.

Cover the bus with a good cover if practical  If not, at least protect
it from the sun to save that new paint.

When re-activating, remove the tape and silica gel, fill with gas, and
reinstall battery.  Crank it over and hopefully it will start right up
after the carburator fills with fuel. Check for fuel leaks (gaskets
sometimes will dry out) and correct if needed.  Readjust the rear
brakes.  Drive gingerly at first until the rust gets scrubbed off of
the brake disks/drums.  Change oil again and you should be in good
shape.
