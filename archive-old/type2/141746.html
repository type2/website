Hi Volks folks,

Next weekend, June 10th to 12th, is LiMBO On Long Island.  As long as there
isn't an ocean between you and the NY metro area plan on attending.  Check
out http://arasso.tripod_dot_com/ for all the details, ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE
BRINGING YOUR PET ALONG.  

And PS:  No you don't need to be a LiMBO member to attend.  Just have a
fascination with VW buses of any year.  Or even an interest in any model of
VW.  Or be someone who just wants to relax for a couple of days.

See ya there!
