Subject: [T2] Engine stand and POR 15

Hello all, I've got 2 questions for the list.  Has anyone purchased an engine 
stand from RMMW and if so is it capable of holding a 1800cc motor.  In the 
catalog it didn't look all that strong to me but hey what do I know.  If 
anyone knows of a better source for picking up a floor standing engine stand 
I'd appreciate it.  Second question, has anyone used the POR15 heat resistant 
paint on their heater boxes.  If the regular POR15 last forever wouldn't it 
be a good idea to coat the heater boxes with the heat resistant stuff?  I'm 
going to need a new heater boxes and the thought of spending all that bread 
just to have them rust away in 2 years is painful.  Any input is always 
appreciated.  Marcus
