Subject: My Timing Clarification

Dear All,

It was not my intention to start a fight and I really don't like to argue,
I was never sure which was which, ATDC/BTDC, left/right, until yesterday.
I own a 71 which came my way with a 009 and was always timed with advance
(BTDC) at idle ~8 degrees.  I recently bought a remanufactured vac dizzy
which is not exactly the same as what originally came with the 71 engine.
In my quest to time it runs great at ~5 degrees BTDC.  This raised some
eyebrows with me when I looked at the Bentley and Muir diagrams of 5
degrees ATDC.  I next looked at the 72 and later models which say ATDC but
looks like my setting of BTDC.  This is where I became confused.

Type 1 engines are degreed on the pulley face with a notch and lined up
with the crack in the case.  Type 4 engines are degreed on the case and TDC
is marked on the pulley with a notch.  Therefore in the diagrams ATDC looks
exactly opposite in the T1 and T4 while being the same thing.

This is why half of my responses were one way and the other half another.
The Honorable George Lyle brought this to my attention and I thank him for
bringing sense to the dilemma.  Again my apologies, I realized that this is
what many had already down in their mind it just took a little while to get
into mine.  

I appreciate the patience and hope this helped someone else besides just
me.  I would be happy to add my take of the scene if anyone is interested
please pmail.
