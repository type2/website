Subject: RE: [T2] Need Master Cylinder and Vaccum Booster for 71 Single
  Cab

&gt; I need to locate a master cylinder and vaccum booster for a 
&gt; 71 VW Single Cab T2 Truck. Anyone have them or know where to 
&gt; get them? Any help will make me smile! 


Same as on a '71 Bus. Links below. The master cylinder is readily
available; the booster a bit spottier in availability but usually not a
problem.
