Subject: Re: [T2] Valve cover gasket sealer?

Most leak problems seem to come from sliding of the gasket if the valve 
cover moves as the bale is slid over the cover.  It doesn't help if the 
gasket is all warped or twisted.  It's harder due to the bulky heat 
exchanger compared to a Type 1 engine.  Make sure the flange of the 
cover seats evenly over the edge of the head, especially as the bale is 
slide up.  I cut a piece of 1x4 to a taper and use it above the cover as 
a wedge to keep the cover from riding upwards as I use a crowbar or flat 
bar fulcrumed against the edge of the heaterbox to lift up the bale. 
Use grease where the bale contacts to ease this.
