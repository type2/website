Subject: Re: [T2] '69 and a '71 bus comparison !

&gt; Say the list hit the last lottery...What would the &quot;reasonably perfect&quot;
&gt; bus have? Answers limited to stuff on 68-79 only, mix 'n match your
&gt; features/deletions...(Doktor Tim not eligible since each bus was per-
&gt; fect when it left Germany and only imperfect owners ruined them... ;-(

Tony, your question assumes that price is no object; that sort of skews
the answer, doesn't it? But with money not an issue, wouldn't a '78
drivetrain with a '75 exhaust be the place to start? (You'd have to
move to some place without smog laws, but money is no object.)

Mark &quot;the perfect bus is the one you own&quot; Hineline
