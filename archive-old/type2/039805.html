Subject: paint coces

Hi all, I know it's a bit of a long shot, but I wonder if anyone can match a
paint code to a colour for me. The colour is a type of purpley/blue, and is
normaly found on the bottom half of 'splittys', if anyone knows the colour
I'm talking about, and also has the code for it, or at least knows where I
can get it, I would be very gratefull if they could pass on the info to me.
                   Thanks Steve.
