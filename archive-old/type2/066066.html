Subject: oil leak fixed

hey now,

well, i checked out my major oil leak today. looks like it was gushing out of
the valve gasket. i knew i had a bad leak but didn't realize how bad it was.
i parked last night so i could see where it was leaking from. this morning
when i looked i had lost about 3/4 of a quart and it was under the valve cover.
i changed the gasket today and it hasn't leaked at all. i do have a small leak
from somewhere but just a dime sized leak in about the 3 hours i parked the van
after driving it today.

also noticed the oil filter was a bit loose so i tightend that up.

hope that is all the problem was.

later,
