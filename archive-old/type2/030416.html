As of noon, EST, the count was as follows:

moderate           44
don't mind (mixed)  9     
Friday only         3
don't moderate     12

There was great strength of opinion on both sides and I was impressed with
the depth of thought that went into your responses (I kinda expected the
strong opinions :).  I am going to add a line onto the charter that
discourages, but does not forbid posts concerning e-bay, and will filter
for them.  

I will pass on posts individually, favoring those that are of the form &quot;I
saw someone was looking for a Wilmington nut for their '71 recently, well
there is one up for bid at e-bay&quot; (especially if I remember the post
requesting a wilmington nut) and killing the two liners of the form &quot;I
have an X for sale at e-bay&quot;.  The Friday-only suggestions had merit,
despite their minority status, and I am still considering them.

In addition, I recognise that I need to rewrite the whole paragraph on
buying and selling on the list.  There are some mis-conceptions that I
need to clear them up.  It looks like there is a common belief that
for sale or wanted are restricted to Fridays.  This is not true. The
restriction on for sale is that it is restricted to VW buses (and related
impedimenta). Side mention of other VW parts is allowable, if the majority
are bus related (you just bought a barn full of Bus parts and there are
some bug parts, too)

The whole purpose and philosophy of this list is that it is dedicated to
helping buses and bus owners.  Helping members get and get rid of parts
fits right in; encouraging vendors, especially those who offer expertise
in addition to parts, also fits in. Encouraging a run-up in parts prices
by advertising parts at auction does not fit in.
