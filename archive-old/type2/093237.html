&gt;Was it only for oil pressure? Could the predrilled 914 plate be used to 
&gt;mount a new VDO sender?

The oil pressure sender mounts in the same location on either a bus or 914 
engine.  The 914 plate is for an oil temperature sender, which the bus 
never received.  I have a 914 plate in my bus engine that I found after 
YEARS of searching the wrecking yards and I use it for it's designed 
purpose, an oil temp sender.  For pressure I use the dual sender at the end 
of the VDO adapter hose that is in the stock location near the 
distributor.  BTW, the 914 plate is more than just &quot;predrilled&quot;.  The 
sender mount is predrilled *and* recessed so that the sender protrudes into 
the main crankcase.  The sender ends up at the same spot as a dipstick 
sender would (as evidenced by the fact that I had to cut 1&quot; off of the end 
of the dipstick for clearance after installing the sender).

&gt;BTW, is there a webpage that summarizes all the places for connecting up 
&gt;all the additional sensors when installing a gauge cluster?

I don't know, but the type2 library would be a good place to start.  If 
it's not there, maybe you could write it?  :)
