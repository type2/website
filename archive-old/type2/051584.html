Subject: [T2] Tranny replacement costs 83 vanagon

So far my research has found 6 vendors with the following prices on a 
rebuild tranny for my 82-83 Vanagon:

AA Transaxle, Seattle.....$795    $300 core  3 year warrantee

Weddle Industries, Goeleta....$895   $400 core

Transform, Long Beach.....$599 reduced RPM    275 Core

CalImports, Blaine, Wash.    $617    250 core

Rancho Performance  $499      350 core

As you can see the spread is $850 to $1300 depending on if the core is good.

I am going to be heading south next week so I would lean to a vendor 
in this direction as I could pick the unit up and see if the core is 
good while there, and avoid some shipping costs.

I am curious to what others think of these suppliers and their 
experiences.  Please email me off list.

Thanks
