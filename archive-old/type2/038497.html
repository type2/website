Subject: Re: exhaust system repair

thought once in a while I should say something went right

got a Pacesetter muffler for my 78 from Bus Depot recently got around to
putting it on today, was afraid of having problems after hearing all the
problems with them not fitting etc.

yanked my old rust can.  cleaned the ends of the flanges.

put all six bolts in losely, and pulled em tight, perfect fit!

took about 20 minutes (after I got the old one off)

nothing else to say....!

Bob
