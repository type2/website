Subject: ultra low idle

hey guys and gals..
I've got me a 1600 SP in the ol 71....Stella
Everything was a-ok yesterday and I was finally happy...but then when I
went to go home at night..I started it... and it idles REALLY low...like
200-300 rpm...and the choke and everything is working.  there is no
smoke from the exhaust or anything...normal running...it just idles
ultra low.  all cylinders are firing to the best of my
knowledge....timing is on...dizzy parts are good...plug wires are
good...all that jazz is fine.  When I press on the gas pedal to about
3/4 of the way down...it goes up to about 1K-2K rpm..but when I floor
it...it all kicks in and jumps to 5K rpm...I drove around a little while
really ticked off and then it went away...after it warms up the problem
goes away and all is normal and freeway speeds are once again no
problem...
there is no stuttering, no popping, jumping, smoke etc...just an
extremely low idle.
what gives?
sounded like an vacuum leak to me... but I can't seem to find any.

what are all the things that could cause this?
thanks!
