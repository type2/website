Subject: Crashed my pics of Bluerocks campout-anyone have some?

Please, to any who took digipics at the Blue Rocks Campout, I had a
crash when downloading the pics and the card unformatted somehow- can
anyone send pics they may have, especially of the pumpkins- my daughter
did the &quot;VW Bubblehead&quot; pumpkin, and we camped with  Jon Kleckner,  we were
the
beige- green Westy with the &quot;mailbox&quot; pod on top and tent hanging under
the awning.  We'll be at Punkin Chunkin also.
