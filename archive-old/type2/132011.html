&gt; Also consider removing the finish around the lug bolt seating area to

The problem here is beware of powder coaters and give them instructions. A
good one should be masking bores and threads and putting those little nubs
in the welded on nuts, etc otherwise you'll have a really difficult time
getting things back together.
