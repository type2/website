Subject: 68 Westy Runs too Good?

Ok,  I just finished a tuneup on my 68 westy.  It had sat for two years,
I drove it home and did the follwing:

New fuel filter, fuel line, cleaned air cleaner, changed oil, new Bosch
platinum plugs, wires, cap, generator belt, and fresh air hoses.

The valves, points, and condender will be done tomorrow.

I installed a rotor from my FLAPS, and the engine would not start.  So i
put the old one in and it was fine.

So, my question---

After  my  &quot;tune-up&quot; i drove the bus.  It had a tremendous power
increase!!!  But, it starts to hesitate and sputter at high rev.  Also
the idle RPM has seemed to increase.  Did I do something wrong? Are my
valves too tight. does my crab need adjusting.  Or is everything fine,
and its just the RPM cutoff in the rotor???  Im new please help!

Question #2.  My engine is leeking oil? how can I stop this?  Thanks!!

Matt
