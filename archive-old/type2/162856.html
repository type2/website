Subject: some answers to vicious attack on T2

	I dispute some of Clive &lt; clive_at_dogandlemon_dot_com&gt;'s criticisms.

&gt;
&gt;&gt;Tyres expensive
&gt;
&gt;	look who's talking  -  not nearly as much as your Desert Duellers!
	Actually 7.00 x 14  =  185 x 14  -  just
got new Korean 8-ply-rated; fitted &amp; balanced
$110 which doesn't strike me as very expensive.
Several fairly common wheels e.g Furd Foulcar
take same tyre, studs.

&gt;
&gt;&gt;Lights a joke, so bad it can be difficult to get wof

&gt;	I take it this refers to 6V models  -  irrelevant
	Actual headlights turn out to be the best I've ever had (12V halide)

&gt;
&gt;&gt;No heater
&gt;
&gt;	my '57 had a heater (air direct past
&gt;exhaust manifold) and  the '73 does too.  OK
&gt;except on long downhill stretches when burning
&gt;no fuel.  It is simply false to say &quot;no heater&quot;.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;  be aware engine designed in mid 30's
&gt;
&gt;	just shows how far ahead die Krdute were
&gt;	'73 1600 not same crank as early 1200s
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;  Not light on fuel 20 - 22 mpg
&gt;
&gt;	Averaged 26 mpg first 1255 mi  -  mainly
&gt;flat-out rural cruising.  Expect to improve
&gt;somewhat on this, what with water injection etc.
&gt;Weight is just over 3000 lb !


&gt;  &gt; &quot;high risk lifestyle choice rather than
&gt;practical, avoid kombis like the plague, unless
&gt;stupidly determined, def have it checked out by
&gt;vw specialist&quot;
&gt;
&gt;	Of course there's a risk of big costs  -
&gt;as with any 33-y-old.  May have to cash in the
&gt;'53 V8.
&gt;Am incashing '69 Renault 10 soon.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Good luck
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;	yes I will need some luck
