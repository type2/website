Subject: engine rebuild kits, or pieces parts

--part1_b6.7a4c792.29b800de_boundary

Hello again everyone, Bus Gypsy here. I posted a question not too long ago 
about an engine kit. I will rebuild my engine myself but need some advice.  
May go with 1776. Found a rebuild kit online and the price was good. However, 
it was from GEX and I have heard some nasty things about this company. Does 
anyone know any other company that sells such kits, or should I piece it 
together ?   Any info on the dependability of a 1776 would be greatly 
appreciated.  B.t.w.  I am from Brattleboro Vermont. Thank you for your time.
                                                 Bus Gypsy 70
