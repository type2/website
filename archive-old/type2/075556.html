Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Pump for a 78

Mark,

I agree, even my Dad would never do such a thing.  I think everyone on
both vw lists I am on is getting stressed(full moon?).

What Tim is tryingto say, is that everyday he deals with people that want
their cars fixed cheap and he has learned over the years that to keep his 
customers and himself happy, it's gotta be the non cheap way for him.

I don't know if there is such a thing as a rebuilt pump for vw fi, but
nobody seems to have been able to come up with a better &quot;new&quot; alternative
that I am aware of.  It seems to be one of those parts that you just have
to cough up the bucks for and then go on your way.

Maybe the hint about ford truck pumps that are the same as the vw ones
might work out.  If they are the same, I wonder what they sell for against
the price quoted for the vw ones.....hmmmmmm



Cheers, dave

&gt; Maybe bus ownership gives us all a different way of
&gt; looking at things.
&gt; 
&gt; I can guarantee you that I have had many more
&gt; experiences packed into these 28 years than many
&gt; people twice my age.
&gt; 
&gt; PS, help me fix my pump!!

&gt; &gt; Not even Bosch can rebuild a Bosch FI fuel pump.
&gt; &gt; Watch out for that $127
&gt; &gt; rebuild by who????? If you want the most money when
&gt; &gt; your 60, pay the price
&gt; &gt; for a new Bosch pump now. Compromise is great risk
&gt; &gt; of pain for your wallet. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You wallet just ain't deep enough to carry the
&gt; &gt; freight??? Bust ass, get an
&gt; &gt; evening part time job. If you ain't got enough
&gt; &gt; time/money to make it work
&gt; &gt; for sure, how do you justify throwing away money on
&gt; &gt; cheap?????? 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hit a junkyard, take your chances. Look for a
&gt; &gt; possible newer replacement
&gt; &gt; pump on a ratty chassis. Sometimes you get lucky.
&gt; &gt; The risk is quick failure
&gt; &gt; of an old pump that has been inactive for more than
&gt; &gt; a year. Might work a
&gt; &gt; week, might work for an hour, might not work at all.
&gt; &gt; You risk all with
&gt; &gt; hopin' and guessin'. You risk nothing with a new
&gt; &gt; Bosch pump, if you install
&gt; &gt; it correctly, and put in a new filter to insure
&gt; &gt; results. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Criminy, if you can afford 5 vehicles, two of which
&gt; &gt; are less than 4 years
&gt; &gt; old,  how is it you can't afford a new pump, how is
&gt; &gt; it you can afford to
&gt; &gt; throw money at squeeky cheap on the VW so's you can
&gt; &gt; make the mortgage
&gt; &gt; payments on the newer rides,????

&gt; &gt; &gt;Fellow Bus owners:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;I have figured out that my fuel pump is locked up
&gt; &gt; or
&gt; &gt; &gt;something. I took it out and it whirs, but it will
&gt; &gt; not
&gt; &gt; &gt;pull gas.  Is there a way of fixing it?  Paying
&gt; &gt; $127~
&gt; &gt; &gt;for a rebuilt pump is out of my league right now. 
&gt; &gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt;have bid on one on Ebarf and some guy bids it up
&gt; &gt; &gt;higher.  Anyways, anybody have a used one for sale
&gt; &gt; for
&gt; &gt; &gt;cheap, That works?  Can I cut mine open, free the
&gt; &gt; &gt;obstruction or rust, and have my room mate tig weld
&gt; &gt; it
&gt; &gt; &gt;back together?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Any Ideas? Any Help?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Thanks
