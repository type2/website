Subject: looking for the flawess engine?!!

Howdy Volks!
Im sure, in fact I know, this is out done..... BUT. I just dropped Blue off
for a Rebuild tonight. My rebuilder says he will bill me for 18 hours, so
including ordering parts and all Im giving it a week or two optimistically.
When I get it back I want it to last (who doesnt) I looked up rebuild
maintenance in the archives (also looked under user searches,who was looking
up &quot;sex&quot;?  lol) and didnt really find what I was looking for. I know the
general maintenance that needs to be done from my haynes and Muir.  Are
there any words of wisdom from the list? I liked what someone said awhile
ago about treating his engine to 93 grade every third fill up or so and
adding mystery oil at intervals (&quot;acccess sys Bob?&quot;)  I have a 914 engine,
not sure yet if its a 1.7 or 1.8.
    Just looking for those extra added personal maintenance rituals
performed with good results from the listees. There should be a page or
something with these responses(if any) who knows, once we let all our
secrets out we may be looking at the flawless 200,000 mile air-cooled!! This
is my 2nd VW but my first rebuild and I want to leave nothing to chance!
(knock on some other door MURPHY!!)
Thnx in advance!
Take care
Steve
