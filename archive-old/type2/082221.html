Subject: Re: [T2] exhaust leak

Kyle
To find an exhaust leak get yourself a Stethescope (Sears for about $15) and 
listen...you will find and exhaust or vacuum leaks with it.
Stereo:  Usually most stereos have 2 power source hookups, one is for the 
permanent memory that hooks directly to the Battery and the other is switched 
from the fuse box.
Speaker Installation: Good Quality (Pioneer, Kenwood, etc) 6x9's on the face 
of the storage compartment under the back seat/bed. (they take up very little 
space and sound really good...just make sure they are in solid so as not to 
be pushed out)
Aloha
