Subject: Battery Tray Replacement

OK.

I received a new 'primed?' battery tray from Bus Depot (shameless plug) for 
my '72 camper last week.

The battery is now on the drivers side, with a long power cable, and the 
driver's side battery tray has a BIG hole in it, almost the size of the 
battery, but not quite.  So it still had a lot of strength around the edges.

Now what do I do??

Thanks for the hints.
