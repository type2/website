Subject: 84 inspection wanted:Dayton,OH

Greetings-

I was hoping there would be someone in the Dayton, OH area that could
help me- I am looking at purchasing an 84 vanagon that I would like
to have inspected before I buy it- I am familiar with body/mechanical
type stuff but on engines I am clueless. Hopefully we
could do it in the next few days. If there is anyone
who can help, please call me _at_ 513-767-7594, or email to
geosh_at_college.antioch_dot_edu
Unfortunatly, all the VW shops close by are closed lots of days
for the labor day weekend.. :(

Please! We can negotiate a trip to Amar India afterwords....
