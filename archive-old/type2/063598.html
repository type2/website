Subject: Thermo Time Swith Answer. 

Yesterday I posted a question about the Thermo Time Switch. Well if
all else fails, RTFM. I was assuming this was a two terminal device 
because it only has two terminals, and all the other parts seem to carry
the grond side therough wires through the connectors. However, the Thermo
Time Switch uses the case as ground. Once I looked carefully at the wiring
diagram I figured it out. 
Turns out both are good. Even the one that was in the fire! Anyone have
an idea at what temperature this thing is supposed be stay open without any 
heater current?

I also went over the distributor. The Vacuum advance 'motor' has two vacuum 
hose nipples. Where to they go? (remember all my hoses are in the bottom of the
shop vac;-()

I also worked on the wiring harness ringing it out for shorts and opens.
Although there are several sections where the wires are melted together, there
were no shorts or opens, even in some of the connectors that are fairly 
melted on the outside. A few of the smaller branches are bare wire though
and I'll have to re-do them.

I'm suprised how many of the parts that are melted on the outside, are still
functional.
