Subject: [T2] Bus to Fiero engine?


&gt;Hey.  I just wonder if anyone has ever thought of putting a Pontiac
&gt;fiero engine and trans in their bus.  I'd like to know if it could be
&gt;done.  Just for my own personal enjoyment.


           Right on man, I like hearin all these engine conversion ideas.
Its my opinion that for all the VW engines good design features its starting
to outlive its practicality. Parts are too expensive and you cant get the
good ones from Germany. I like the Subaru conversions. I was thinking even
better yet how about a H.E.V (Hybred Electric Vehicle) transplant, this
would be way ahead of the curve and makes more sense than straight
electric. -Moe 77 bus
