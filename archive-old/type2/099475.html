Subject: Help with final decision on tires for Westy

Hey, my bus finally runs and I have to get some tires to replace the 
ANCIENT things that are on those rims (Michelin XZX 185 R 14, 94R.)

This isn't the start of a tire thread. I've read all the FAQ's on the type 
2 web site, and have followed and copied and studied Westy tire threads for 
years. Now I need some people to edit/criticize my synthesis of all that 
data and point out any blank spots in my conclusions.
Please just off-list email me your analysis of my post.

I have a 1976 Westy with a rebuilt type 4 two liter, and 10 year old tires 
that are cracking and splitting and really scary, but they served well for 
a long time and in many situations.

I can replace them very reasonably ($) with tires that have the same 
specifications as far as I can tell....Continental CR-21  185 R 
14C   94R  MS rated, at $50 each (Tire Rack).

I'll have these tires for another 5 years, and will mostly be using them to 
get from Ohio to places like Michigan and Pennsylvania for summer camping 
and gatherings, with two people and basic camping gear. This will be my 
vacation vehicle, and not a daily driver. I'm not going to carry furnaces 
or engine blocks or barrels of whiskey or other commercial usages. Just two 
people and some food, water and gear. (Maybe a spare engine and some parts 
and tools? :~)

I need some reasons to spend extra dollars for some other brand and 
specification of tire...upgrades  I guess you would call them. I hope some 
of you will suggest some good reasons to choose one or two of these upgrades.

Today's marketplace as far as I can tell offers the following tires, 
arranged by descending price:

Michelin Agilis 185 R 14C, 102R, (5.5 inch width,) 1,710/54 psi.....$109 each.

Cooper SRM II Radial LT
   185 R 14C, 102/100Q, load range D, 1875/65psi. .................. $79 each.

Dunlop SP LT-5 185 R 14,   (5.5 inch width)  1855/65psi...........  $83 each.

Bridgestone 603V Highway Rib 185 R 14  Load range D   1855/65 psi...$71 each.

Yokohama 356D  185 R 14, load range D,(5 inch width) 1850/65 psi,...$57 each.

Continental CR-21
   185 R 14 C, 94R  (Reinforced) (5.5 inch width)1,540 at 40psi......$50 each.

Most of the above tires are also available in 195/75/R14, load range C and 
D, for about the same price. If that is a better choice of size, please let 
me know.

#1.  IS THIS TRUE? &quot;There isn't any good argument for spending $109 for the 
Agilis, when the $50 Continental will do almost same thing for the vehicle.&quot;


#2.  I AM UNCERTAIN ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS PIECE OF DATA: The 
Yokohama 356D shows a measured tire width of 5 inches, and all the other 
brands show a 5.5 measured tire width. Is this significant?

#3.  IS THIS TRUE? &quot;All the above listed tires will fit my steel 5.5 x 14 
H1 ET39 original rims and will meet the MINIMUM load-bearing requirements 
for the vehicle.&quot; I can't go wrong safety-wise buying any of the above 
tires. They will all do the job if I don't load my vehicle with incredible 
extra stuff and try to drive in a hurricane on gravel roads at 85 miles an 
hour for 24 hour periods in the Mohave desert, and getting passed by 
triple-trailer semi's.

#4   IS THIS TRUE? &quot;All of the above tires have reinforced sidewalls that 
will stabilize the vehicle in cross winds and truck-passings, and in 
emergency maneuvers, compared to non-reinforced passenger car tires. They 
will resist rolling off the rims in extreme situations.&quot;

#5   IS THIS TRUE? &quot;None of the above tires will make the vehicle ride so 
stiffly that even the most  stoical and enduring passenger would say the 
tires do not need to be that harsh.&quot; (Assuming that the pressures are set 
at a level appropriate for the load and below the maximum allowable.)

OK, I'm about ready to order the Continentals, because they cost half of 
what the Michelins or Coopers would cost, and I can't see any good reason 
to spend the extra money....twice as much.

And the same argument applies to all those brands in between. For instance, 
why should I buy the Bridgestones over the Continentals?

Are the Yokohama's a slightly better choice than the Continentals? They 
cost slightly more and are rated in a different manner, so it is hard to 
compare them.

ALL opinions are very welcome. Please feel free to send me some opinions 
and reasons for making a different decision.
