Subject: RE: [T2] Looking for part numbers for 050 distributor

&gt; I have an 050 on hand that i need to install but it is missing the cap and
&gt; rotor.  The local vw flaps said NLA........but i know this is not
&gt; true....... Please pmail the part numbers so that i can order
&gt; them.........


The cap is Bosch part number  9 231 081 413, which I have for $9.95.  The
rotor is  9 231 061 628, currently out of stock but not discontinued.  (My
memory tells me that a more common rotor also works but I don't recall
which.)

This is a good example of how you can use my website as a reference tool...
typing in 050 in the keyword search box pulls up the cap part number (but
not the rotor, at the moment, as it is temporarily unavailable).
