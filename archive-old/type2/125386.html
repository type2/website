Subject: RE: [T2] Need outdoor cover for camper 

&gt; why not just tie or bracket the license plate so that it sits 
&gt; very low when in storage (between the bottom of the cover and 
&gt; the ground), or even tape or tie it to the outside of the cover?&lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; maybe i'm being pessimistic here, but isn't that absolutely begging 
&gt; someone to steal your license plate?


I don't see any difference. How much more secure is your plate in the
original location versus a foot lower (unless the thief in 	question
is amazingly short :-)?  If a thief needed a license plate, he could
steal just about any plate from any car anywhere in about 10 seconds
with nothing but a flathead screwdriver or a knife blade. They're not
exactly kept under lock and key to begin with.
