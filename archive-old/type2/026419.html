Okay, I give up.  New engine in.  Finally got it started,after draining bad gas out of tank (full, naturally) and replacing starter.  Took it out on maiden voyage (dinner at great mexican restaurant) wound up coming back on a hook!  Bad fuel pump.  So this weekend I will put a fuel pump in....but....I still am not satisfied with the way this thing runs.  I passed emissions, am able to drive around town fine, but cold start problem is still there as well as rough idle.  As I am currently in the middle of remodeling my house, preparing for final exams and working a s**tload of hours, I have finally decided (aarrgh!) that my 82 westy will have to go to a shop for the final touches if I want to be able to drive it before Christmas (2002, at this rate).
So, anybody out there have any experience with any shops in the Tucson area (that's in Arizona, the really hot place)?  I would appreciate any suggestions.
Thanks in advance
Mike Edwards
