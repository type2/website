Subject: Re: [T2] top end rebuild and compression

&quot;cleaned the heck out of them &quot; may have
caused damage to the ring lands.
Loss of seal in this area will not be regained.
Scratches will be enough to fail them.
Rings are also not broken in at the 20 minute mark.
This can take 100 miles or more for the soft cast
rings, up to maybe never for the hard expensive ones.

Subject: [T2] top end rebuild and compression


&gt; Well, several weeks of rebuilding work finally culminated yesterday.  I
&gt; started the engine after my first shot at rebuilding and... it worked!
&gt; She started up the first time!  I ran the engine for 20 minutes _at_2000
&gt; rpm as recommended by Tom Wilson to break it in.  I had some problems
&gt; getting it to idle at the correct rpm since the engine would die under
&gt; about 1100 rpm.  Today, I realize that this was probably due to the fact
&gt; that I forgot to reconnect the air flow meter cable.  (Duh!  That one hit
&gt; me in the shower this morning).
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, yesterday, I didn't realize this so I started investigating.  My
&gt; wonderful wife helped crank the motor while I did compression readings and
&gt; here's what I got (1/2/3/4 order): 100/110/90/100psi.  I was somewhat
&gt; disappointed, since I had replaced the heads with rebuilt ones from AVP
&gt; and re-ringed the pistons.  Wear on the p&amp;c's looked good (actually
&gt; borrowed a micrometer from a coworker), so I kept the old ones and
&gt; cleaned the heck out of em.  With the old setup I had: 110/110/0/110psi
&gt; before the rebuild (dropped valve seat in #3 was the reason for the rebuild).
&gt;
&gt; My question is: shouldn't my compression be a bit higher?  I was expecting
&gt; something like 120-130 all the way around.  Why would mine be so &quot;low&quot;?
&gt; Is there something I may be missing which is causing a small compression
&gt; leak?
