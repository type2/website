&gt; In response to the Carbon Monoxide detectors, if you find your exhaust

&gt; Heaterboxes?

The heaterbox is a very thick section of exhaust pipe with aluminum
fins around it, wrapped in a sheet metal box that air is passed
through.  It is unlikely, given the thickness of the inner pipe,
that you would leak fumes directly into the supposedly fresh air,
though anything will rust out given enough time.  You can
pressure-test for leaks, but if they are not *very* rusty, likely
causes are elsewhere.

Since the air for heating is sucked from the upper engine compartment,
if it is not completely sealed from the lower, and there is an exhaust
leak, fumes will be drawn into the fan (it's sucking a lot of air,
remember) and into the cab.  The rear engine hatch seal is another
culprit, allowing fumes into the upper engine area.

Those clamps that hold the
exhaust to the heaterbox are usually leaking, I've ended up having
to put muffler tape around the junction, with hose clamps on either
side, plus the stock clamp in between to keep it from rattling apart.
Seems to work.

Also, a leak here, if you also have leaks where the actual box
part fits around the finned part (I've seen lots of heater boxes
that are loose like this) can puff exhaust right into the air stream,
not a good thing.

So, check for exhaust leaks (put your hand all around the exhaust,
being careful not to get burned, to feel for puffs), make
sure your engine compartment
is completely sealed as VW intended, and most likely your fumes
will be reduced.  Also, if you spilled oil all over a paper fresh
air hose, it will eventually stink (ask me know I know).
