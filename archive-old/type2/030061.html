There are nice small antennas for CB, but they don't work very well.  A
quarter wave on 27MHz is a bit over 100 inches long.  that's the antenna
length you want.  You can get a long whip, or you can try to fool mother
nature by wrapping the antenna into a coil.  You can fool the transmitter,
but your radiated signal is pretty much a function of the antenna length.
The best compromise is a 4-foot firestik antenna, commonly available at
truckers outlets.  It works reasonably well but isn't all that long.
