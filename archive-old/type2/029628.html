&gt;  I try to 
&gt; &gt;prevent that by taking each one out and inspecting it at least once a year.  
&gt; 
&gt;

&gt; 		I would agree but would go one step further.  If your driving
&gt; your bus 10 to 15 thousand miles a year I would think it standard to 
&gt; replace them every 3 years.  Just a good preventive measure.  The cost
&gt; of the two cables is so minimal compared to breaking down in a bad 
&gt; situation I would think it's worth it.  I replaced mine on the 'unknown'
&gt; bus I bought as a matter of course.  Mostly because of you guys and 
&gt; your previous experiences.
&gt; 
I guess I'm not all that good at preventative maintainance, but I replace
mine when they go bad.  they usually give a short warning by breaking a
few strands, which causes low pedal.  If you catch it then, you can
replace it in your driveway and be able to pull the whole thing out at
once.

&gt; &gt;I put them back in with plenty of grease, I like to use CV joint grease. 
&gt; I used grease but can't figure out why everyone says to.  They slid in 
&gt; just fine without grease during the trial fit.

The grease isn't to help them slide in.  It's to lubricate the cable's
motion while in operation and to prevent the cable and housing from
corroding.

&gt; &gt;spare.  I compare the newly replaced cable with the one I'm carrying as a 
&gt; &gt;spare and keep the best of the 2 as my spare.

This sounds like a really good way to end up with two marginal cables!  I
prefer to carry a new one as a spare, first making sure that it is the
correct length and then packaging it in something a bit more secure than
the normal little plastic bag.  When a cable gets replaced, the parts box
one goes in and another new cable takes its place.
