Subject: RE: [T2] How hot is HOT?

Scott, I have all three (head temp, oil temp., oil pres.) and I now consider
it MANDAORY.

Head Temp:
-Tells your about your mixture (lean/rich)
-tells you if your going up hill (the gradual ones . . .) or heading into
the wind and compensating by leaning on the throttle

Oil Pressure:
-tells me if if a pressure valve is sticking
-pressure is related to oil temp (lower when hot, higher when cold)

Oil Temp: Tell's me when to pull my ass over and let it cool down. Really
useful for those desert jaunts, but necessary for pulling long steep
mountain passes.

Some will say that it shouldn't overheat if it's stock(and they may be
right), but these are cheap insurance to protect your investment. And they
look cool :)
-Chris

PS - I agree with Jack Raby on mounting the head temp on anything but the
spark plug (number 3e to be exact). I had mine hooked up to a head bolt. It
worked fine until I overheated my motor. Putting it on the plug raised my
temps by 50 degrees and it responded MUCH faster.
