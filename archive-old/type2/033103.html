Subject: Re:Bar oil spraying 

Was having the same problem with applying bar oil as an undercoating, ie: Way 
Too Much Viscosity. After pounding my head on the kitchen counter for a bit, 
my lovely and talented wife chimed in. &quot;Hey doofus, that stuff you want to 
put on the bottom of Gretchen (our ' 78 westy) is about as thick as that El 
Cheapo $1.05 a gallon, Baby Snot Green paint you just SPRAYED on the side of 
the garage last weekend!&quot; Duh. Went out to said garage, took the trusty 
Wagner Power Painter (model 860) out of its box, slapped in the oil based 
venturi/nozzle chingadaro and siphon hose thingie, put on the safety glasses, 
grubby clothes etc. and got down to it. Worked like a charm. One note: The 
oil was at room temp, 70 deg. or thereabouts.( and my garage has one Baby 
Snot Green wall, the others are off white...Don't Ask.)  Score yet another 
blow to my &quot;Superior All Knowing Powers of Improvisation&quot;.
