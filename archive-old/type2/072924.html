Subject: new brake rotors FS

I have a pair of NEW, Lucas-Girling disc brake rotors for a 73-79 bus... I
bought them for my bus, but it had  early 72 spindles :P

My cost is your cost: $60 includes shipping to any US city.

NOTE: I AM ONLY GOING TO TAKE PAYPAL FOR THESE PARTS; sorry, but the last
10 times I've posted stuff for sale here, only 3 people actually sent the
money. I can return these to the place I got 'em, but thought I'd try to
pass on a deal to Listees first..........
