==========================================================================

1971 westy &quot;wunderbus&quot;, was going to  restore but had to move,
please save her, needs engine, front brakes, features FULL WIDTH Z-bed and
full width (1971) upstairs cot, nice interior, nice shape overall, also
needs one jalousie and front turn signal. solid bus, no title, should get
one from DMV (formerly abandoned). Oh yes, it came with a BN4 which I
pulled but couldn't get started.

located near Hillsborough, NC.

come and get her this weekend please! call 310-729-5318 and leave message
ASAP. good home wanted, parts folks get lower priority, thanks.

Will
