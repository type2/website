&gt; &gt; Not to start an argument, but how did the German's do it on the
original
&gt; &gt; covers?? The wire was in them when I took the old covers off. 
Maybe I am
&gt; 
&gt; *nod*  I dont know how the germans do it.;)  They still do, btw.  New
&gt; Beetle seat covers still have a few sections with sewn-in wire.  I'm
sure
&gt; one could hand feed the wire into the channel, but it definitly adds
a bit
&gt; of labor to the whole ordeal.

That's exactly what I do.  Pull out the nylon string and feed in the
wire.  It's not all that hard, but can be time-consuming.

The reason that I do it this way is because the wire spreads the
tension load more evenly than the string, reducing the incidence of
tearing.

I just used the original wire.  Seems to last fine, as I'm on my third
set of upholstery.
