Subject: Tire Info needed

Volks,

The tire page is a &quot;go&quot;! I want 900 e-mails!!!  Bad!!! ;-)

Seriously, I would like each and every one of you to go out and read your
tires to me.  Please, please, PLEASE *DON'T* post it!  P-mail me at this
address or (by far preferred) at dworkin_at_type2_dot_com.

I need the following info:

Manufacturer:
Tire description:
Tire size:
Load Range:
Max Load:
Max Inflation:
Load Index:
Traction Index:
Treadwear Index:

All this stuff will be printed on the side of the tire.  Write it down and
e-mail it to me.  Please!!!  If you happen to have a P-metric tire, please
let me have the full P-metric code and if you are not in the US, let me
know that too!

Lastly, any volunteers to write html would be greatly appreciated!  Each
tire will require a short page of html on a standard format, which I can
send you.  Let me know.

                           H Steven Dolan
