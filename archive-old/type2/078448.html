Subject: Re: [T2] Now..hot was method...was [T2] Exaust Leak

When I worked in the cruise missile industry, the best compromise for
high strength and corrosion resistance in a high temp environment was
berylium copper.  Not cheap though. Also not 'off-the-shelf'. You'll
have to machine them yourself. (Oh, BTW, wear your particle mask. 
Berylium is v. toxic.) Second choice was 302 CRES. The problem with most
'stainless' steels is that they're not particularly temperature stable. 
As they are thermally cycled, either the strength or the ductility tends
to go away. 

Actually, if your going to go to all the work of making your own, I'd
suggest that a few hours at the local library studying 'Metals Handbook'
would be time well spent. Learn a bit of metalurgy!

The best commercially available product is probably brass.
