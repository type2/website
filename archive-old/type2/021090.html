Subject: 7.00x 14 tire?

List:
I swear this is not another tire thread!
While cleaning up an old storage place of mine this weekend I stumbled
upon an ORIGINAL  Continental 7.00x14 8pr tire. Bias ply, pre radial.
Probably the tire came new on a VW type 2. Pretty nice shape. Can't
remember where I got it, pretty sure it was  NOT the double cab, but
probably from 68 to 70 or so.
It's made in Germany and has US specs on it. Seems like 1450 lbs at 40
psi.
This is a 30 YEAR OLD tire and not really suitable to drive on at speed,
but would make a great tire for an original show car, er bus.
FREE ot the person with best reason for needing it. (I do want  $15 to
wrap it up and ship it in the US.) I reserve the right to be completely
subjective about the judging.
