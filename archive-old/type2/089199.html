I used the the VDO three hole plastic pod for the guages (CHT, OP, OT) I
installed in my '71 Westy.  I assume you bought two of the two holers.  I
just used sticky backed Velcro to hold the pod down to the dash, in the
center over the stock speaker location.  The wires come up through the
existing speaker grill holes in the dash, so this installation is completely
reversible should I or anyone else ever want to remove it.  I would think
that this method would work for your intended setup, too.  It does hog space
formerly used to put &quot;stuff&quot;, but, otherwise it works well.  I especially
like that the guages are highly visible to the driver in this location.

I don't have any pic's but maybe could take some if you think it would help.

Hey, folks,

I am finally getting around to installing the guages I bought for my 74, and
after a bit of fiddling it has become apparent that I officially hate the
plastic 'pods' used to mount them on top of the dash. There just isn't any
good place for those pods to go. I originally bought the pods because I also
have never been a fan of hanging the guages below the dash. So, how have
others solved the mounting problem? I have four guages: oil pressure, oil
temp, head temp, and volts. Any suggestions are gratefully accepted and
pictures, if available, would be a plus!

Thanks in advance,
Dave
