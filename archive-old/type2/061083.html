Flywheel is

&gt; Bus Depot lists part#111 105 313A as &quot;pilot shaft needle bearing
'72-83
&gt; bus/vanogon.&quot; Is this the only part necessary. Is it as simple as
removing

&gt; reinstalling?

Not a type 4 expert, but I don't think that you need to remove the
flywheel to replace the pilot bearing.  What you do need is a pilot
bearing puller, a gizmo with two or three fingers that open behind the
bearing so that it can be pulled out with the force of either a screw
or with a slide hammer.  These tools aren't all that expensive and can
also be rented.

I've made a pilot bearing puller from a long bolt by carefully
grinding the head to a size that will just go through the bearing when
cocked to the side but won't when the shaft of the bolt was parallel
to the centerline of the bearing.  You then put a hex socket over the
bolt (to provide a clearance for the bearing to be pulled into) and
thread a nut on the end.  Tighten the nut and the bearing comes out.

Forget the old procedure of filling the cavity with grease and then
hammering the bearing out with an old pilot shaft.  This worked for
pilot bushings but not for needle bearings.

Before you pull the old bearing, be sure to note its position in the
hole.  You don't want to push the new bearing deeper into the cavity
than the old, since if you bottom it out it will be a bear to remove!
