Subject: Re: [T2] homemade instrument cluster

There really isn't a whole lot involved in cleaning up an instrument
cluster. I just swapped out the dashboard in my '77, PO had cut a huge hole
in the old one for a radio. The instrument cluster didn't even have to be
removed to change out the dash. Anyway, my gauges were dirty inside, and one
lens appeared fogged over, making it difficult to read. There are about 8
screw on the backside that come out and you can open it up and clean the
inside (carefully), mine looks like new.  Jeff
