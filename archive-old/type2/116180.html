Subject: Bus Availability in Junkyards

Hey guys,

	I was just curious how often you guys see Busses in the junkyard
where you live. In the local junkyard that I frequent in Fort Lauderdale,
there is usually on any given day, 3 to 4 busses. I've been there twice in
the past month since I bought my Bus. I think I've had the Bus now for about
a month and a half. The first time I went, there were TWO busses. Just last
weekend I was there, THOSE two busses were gone, and they were replaced with
4 busses (All type 2s). 

Most of them were in pretty decent shape. One of them from both trips had
completely rotted out window frames.. but the rest of the buses were in
really good shape.

If anyone is interested in going there, you can get to that junkyard
(U-PULL-IT) by taking 
I-95 to 5-95 (In Florida, Fort Lauderdale). 
Take 5-95 EAST to 441. 
Take 441 SOUTH. 
Go SOUTH about a mile, and you'll see on the RIGHT (before the first major
intersection) a sign that says &quot;U-PULL-IT&quot;
If you pass GRIFFON road, it means you've passed it, make a U-turn.

They had some late 60s/ early 70s busses there last time. Two Westfalias.
One Orange, one yellow.
