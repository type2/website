Subject: [T2] maiden voyage

Two years and nine months after towing this Westy to my driveway
I finally took it for its first trip.  I'm sure that this was the 
first time in eight years that it has been driven.  

I only drove it around the block a few times, maybe a mile total,
and boy did it feel great!  I still need inspection, emmissions &amp;
plates but it's nice to know that nothing major was going to foul
up (yet :) )  It seemed to shift well and no harsh sounds from 
the tranny.  

It did die on me everytime I went into neutral so the carb still
needs some adjusting.

I just wanted to let people who would appreciate this know that 
another bus was rescued.
