Subject: RE: [T2] AIRS rescue---Engine runs fine, but dies when the 
  engine is under load.

Mike/Erin,


Here is what I am hearing this morning.

It does it whether hot or cold.
It does it with a known good coil.
It does it with a new filter.
It does it with a different ECU.
AFM looks fine.

Ok, can you watch the fuel pressure while causing the problem?
Someone in the back seat with the fuel pressure gauge in front of them?
If so, and it doesn't change, then fuel problems are pretty much out.
It doesn't do any good to check it while it is not having the problem.
I personally had a problem like this and you will not know anything unless 
you read the gauge *while* it is happening!


Mike(Erin), so back up a little....you said you put electronic points 
in...take them back out, or try a dizzy from the other bus....in other words, back 
track to the state your bus was in before it started happening.

Can you truely accelerate just fine on flat road...with gusto?

Put a test light on the hot side of the coil and go test it on a hill.
Still  got light when it happens?  If so, then at least your coil 
feed wires are good.

How much of a hill causes the problem?  big hill? little hill?
If you put a big jack under the front of the bus, can you make it happen 
in the driveway?  Back it off a high curb with just the front wheels on 
the curb...does this make it happen?

Check your plug wire resistances from inside the dist cap to the spark 
plug connector where it goes onto the spark plug.  Look at the dist cap.
I've had a car that ran just fine at idle and low load, but as soon as I 
needed power for load, a crack in the distributor would cause it to start 
misfiring and dying....

Leave the hard stuff like injectors alone untill you check all the easy 
stuff!  And test under actual failure conditions....on a hill!

Loosing spark on a hill?
Loosing fuel pressure on a hill?
Loosing injector electrical feed on a hill?

Need more info!

Good luck, dave

&amp;gt; Thanks for all the help y'all have give so far; we've used the
&amp;gt; discussion to guide our progress.  While we haven't solved the problem,
&amp;gt; we have eliminated a lot of possibilities, which is almost as good...
&amp;gt; :)
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; Here's her writeup on what we did today.
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; --
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; Okay.  After a full day of banging our heads against the bus, we've
&amp;gt; determined the following:
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; -Fuel pressure is within spec with the vaccuum hose disconnected and
snipped&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; -I put a new fuel filter on this morning -- the old one was dirty -- but
&amp;gt; the new filter didn't make any difference in the driving, she still
&amp;gt; can't pull a hill.  We've taken her around the block a few times testing
&amp;gt; different things, and just now I pulled the new-this-morning filter and
&amp;gt; it appears to have crud in it.  Now, keep in mind that even brand new

&amp;gt; Keep in mind also that I reconditioned the tank in January.  So, what
&amp;gt; should I do next?  My first instinct is to pull the fuel rail and look
&amp;gt; at the injectors, although I had the 1/2 side off a few days ago to fix
&amp;gt; a burst hose from the rail to #1 injector and the injectors looked fine,
&amp;gt; but I didn't test them.
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; Which brings me, I suppose, to what I've tested:
&amp;gt; drove mine around the block with his on there and it made no difference.
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; Put on the coil from Mike's bus, no difference.
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; Switched out the electronic control unit for a known functioning one, no
&amp;gt; difference.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
