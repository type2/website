Derek, the one thing you dont mention is weather the case is used and has it 
been overheated.
Hard experience teaches that if a type 1 case has been overheated, it goes 
soft and everything starts to pull out. You'll also have an engine that will 
run hotter and will have a shorter life. Upside is, if its a beater or a 
seller, than tymecerts will work, if its a keeper, bite the bullet and buy a 
new case.
