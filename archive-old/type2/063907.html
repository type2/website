Subject: Window glass

Alright, here it is....

In the 65 I have ?louvered? windows. I think that's what they're called, the
one's on the side with the crank. Anyway, the glass in those windows have slits
along the edge for some reason and there is moss that has grown in there, so I'm
wondering what the best way to get the moss out. Also there's a couple that are
broken and need replacing, does anyone know where to get these? 

Thanks man,
scott.
