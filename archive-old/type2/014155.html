Thanks Terry,
The inner panel is damaged - headlight bucket is kicked in farther than i=
t
should be - kick panel won't sit in its slots correctly...if you look at =
pic 6
in the series, you can see a the floor crinklage as well.
Hinge post is not damaged, but is out of position enough to kick the door=
 out
of alignment engough to require a serious hard slam for it to close.

I guess going into this thinking i'm not going to replace the whole left =
front
side of the bus is a bit of a pipe dream. isn't it?

Estimate?
Impossible without physiclly examinining the bus.
=46rom the looks of it, and this is the way I would do it, I would be
looking for a front R/H door, and a front panel.
The front hinge post could be damaged, the inner panel could be damaged.

Do it right---do it once.
