Subject: Re: EFI sputtering

Turns out my fuel filter is full of rust and furthur more my tank is also 
full of rust. I don't have time nor ability to pull the tank to fix it so I 
took it to my local shop they want $400 to fix the problem. $120 to take it 
to a shop that will soak it in acid for 3 days, flush and coat it with a 
sealant and $280 for labor. What do you think is this too much? I looked but 
could not find a new tank anywhere.

Thanks!
Marvin


&gt;Check your fuel filter first. If it's not that, you've most likely got
&gt;goonk in your gas tank. Rust, probably. It clogs the outlet in the tank,
&gt;you &quot;run out of gas,&quot; then it floats happily away and you can run again
&gt;for a while. BTDT....
