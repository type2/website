Subject: [T2] painting suggestions?

&gt;How did you paint the area behind the air inlet grille?

I prefer to use the &quot;touch-up&quot; gun ( $20 ) available everywhere.
I have painted this area black after the topcoat was applied to
emphasize the vent lines and just carefully wiped the overspray.
An airbrush will work just as well if not better, it has a fine spray
and will get past the vents easily.
