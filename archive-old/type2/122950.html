Subject: wiring question - interior lights

As some of you know I am redoing my interior roof (well pretty much done) 
and yes pictures are coming for it. I am redoing my website to cater to the 
van for a bit. It's become a fun hobby.

Anyway the question is in regards to the existing wiring in the roof for the 
interior lights. I plan on hooking up two neon lights to the existing wiring 
/ switch and was wondering if it could handle the added power without 
melting something.

The specs on the lights are as follows (the neons):
output power: 2.4w
input current : 300 mA
Lamp Current : 5mA
Frequency : 50kHz ~60kHz
Input Voltage : 12V
Lamp Voltage: 570V
Work Life : 15000 hours.

Can the existing wiring handle two of these per light. (2 lights in the 
interior of the van)
The wiring is pretty low gauge and skinny on them.

James
