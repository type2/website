Subject: RE: stuck washer

Thom,
You might like to try prying it out with a screwdriver or similar prying
object.  The washer overhangs the port slightly so you have something to
lever against.  Be careful not to damage the sealing surface though.
It worked for me anyway, YMMV etc.

&gt; anyone know how to get those copper exhaust washers out of the
&gt; head?
&gt; one of mine seems to have welded itself in, although it doesn't
&gt; look melted anywhere.
