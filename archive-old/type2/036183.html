Well, they are under a bit of tension.  I'm assuming that the bus is up on
stands.

Use a floor jack to lift the trailing arm just a bit off the lower stop,
then pry the arm out so that it will just clear the stop.  Now you can
release the tension in the arm.

assembly is the reverse of this procedure.
