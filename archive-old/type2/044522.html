Subject: [T2] How long have your starters lasted, folks?

Hi VW crew,

I just replaced my starter again because it looks as if the solenoid is
getting sticky/ flaky. Bangoing on it with a hammer seemed to briefly
restore function. Five starts later, it failed again. No click, nothing. 
DEash lights dim, brand new battery is fine. I have a '78 bus with auto
transmission. I put in a starter I thought was still good (it had about
25000 miles on it) but now it's doing the same thing. I banged on it with
a hammer and got another start out of it. Tomorrow I'm going shopping for
a brand new rebuilt starter. Starter motors seem OK but solenoids seem
flaky. I got about 25000 miles out of one and about the same out of the
next before failure. This is less than I expected. I don't want to 
replace starters every 2 years from now 'til forever.

So my question to the crew: How long does a rebuilt Bosch starter last in 
your experience? How long have yours lasted?

I have to take starters pretty seriously because I drive an automatidc, 
which means no push starting. I also am driving a lot to pretty remote 
places where I work until dusk. Bad spots to get stranded. 

I've got the standard after market relay in the ignition to starter 
solenoid circuit. Could it be that my relay is failing and starting when 
I bang on the solenoid is just a coincidence? 

If my transaxle fluid were low or in need of changing, would the 
tranmission case get hotter than usual and could that be inducing not 
starting on my solenoid?

Tired of crawling under the bus all the time,
