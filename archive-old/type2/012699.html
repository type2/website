Hi Bob,

Your right about those pins sometimes not connecting. 
So far, the only time my 80 Westy threatened to strand
me was when one of the pins on the air flapper
connector was not mating.  I was lucky and found it
before having to call a tow.  I think my technique was
to stick a screwdriver in to hold the air flap open
while the ignition switch was on.  Of course, you
should hear the gas pump work because the brain thinks
air is being sucked by the engine and gas is needed. 
When I didn't hear the pump, I suspected something was
wrong with the connector.  A ten second fix (although
don't ask me how long it took to find) and it has
never reoccurred.

Rob
