Subject: Re: [T2] Samba Effect  /RANT/

I don't know what part of Oregon those folks are talking about, up here IN
Oregon it's &quot;If I took this down to LA it would be worth $X&quot;.  But you can't
get squat for an old bus around my parts anymore. I had an og paint 66
standard walk through with rebuilt original motor with under 30k, electronic
ignition, newer brakes, tires, reduction box bearings, good trans, in other
words a good daily driver. ran an ad in the paper with no takers, or even
offers.  sold it on the samba for $2500. My favorites are the folks that
think because a restored early 23 was up for sale for 40k it makes their
home brew late model camper worth at least 8-9k, after all a paint job is
only $300 at macco.

There is a lady driving around town with my old brown/tan(ugly) 67 pop top
camper(american) for 2k obo. When I sold it it didn't have a motor or brakes
so I know it's had some work done in the last few years.

Am I the only one who finds a rusted
&gt; out hunk a crap and is then lectured-- by people
&gt; who don't know that the engine is in the back of
&gt; a bus-- about how valuable their bus would be in
&gt; California or Oregon?  After all they saw it on
&gt; Samba.  Yes, their bus, with enough rust through
&gt; around the windshield to make driving at speed a
&gt; dicey prospect, is worth $12,000.
