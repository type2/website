Subject: Getting off Lug Nuts (was: Helping a Fellow Vw'er)

I have a good sturdy cross bar that allows me to pull up on one end while I
stomp on the opposite end.  This gives an impact effect that I have found much
more useful in getting stubborn lug bolts and nuts off than sockets and breaker
bars.  Only failed to work once when the bolt was sloppy to start and rounded
out when I tried to take it off.  Then I tried a 12 point socket and breaker bar
- - big mistake, rounded it even worse.  Finally used a cold chisel to mangle the
bolt, hammered my cross bar onto it and got it of.  The cross bar show no signs
of distress after all this, so I re-iterate, that a good, sturdy cross bar is
the best tool for removing lugs when you have no impact wrench.  (I have seen
cross bars that were springy and wimpy that would have cringed at the abuse mine
has seen).

peace,
terry

hey now,

amanda and i had just pulled onto hillsborough street after coming home from
visiting my folks on monday. i noticed a '79 Westy pulled into the entrance
of Meredith College and the driver looking rather distraught. i couldn't turn
so i went down the block and came back to see if he needed help. he did!

poor guy. had a flat tire. and said he didn't have the little hook thingy-ma-
jig to get off the hubcap. i said no problem and took a long screw driver and
popped it off in about 30 seconds. the second problem stumped me. he had his
wheel jack out and we couldn't figure it out. how does it fit in the little
slots. call me stupid. i do all my tuneup stuff now but i couldn't figure out
how to use the stock vw jack. duh. i even took mine out but couldn't figure
it out. so, and i know you aren't supposed to do this, but i got my floor jack,
and put it under his bus.

next we went after them lug nuts. boy, they were hard to get off. and the vw
stock lug wrench don't help. the lug nuts took us and liquid wrench about 45
minutes to get off. i'm adding a cheater bar onto my list of things to carry
round in the van. that would have helped alot!

anyways, we eventually get his tire changed and back on the road. he had a
NICE '79 Westy that was recently painted. it shined. he said he bought it
from the original owner for $3000. i was jealous. interior was perfect.

add this event to the neverending book of learning...
