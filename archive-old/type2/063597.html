Subject: frozen wh bearings

     Ok, we finally got the frozen front wheel bearings loose on the '63 
     single cab.  It required lots of big hammer action.  Leaving the tire 
     on for this helps enormously.  The spindles were marred under the 
     bearing surface but not messed up.  A small amount of filing and then 
     some emery cloth cleaned it up nicely and the calipers show they are 
     round.  This vehicle sat for over a decade so I'm not surprised.  
     
     The bearings were Timken (france) and survived the beating very well, 
     which I doubt the Chinese replacements would.  I really want to find a 
     source for American or German bearings.  Gainesville, Fl has no decent 
     foreign parts stores if you drive anything out of the norm.  The VW 
     dealer doesn't want us drivers of older vehicles anywhere near their 
     shop.  It's a sign of the times children.  We're on our own and 
     frankly I'm beginning to appreciate that!  Back to VW content:  So, 
     I'm saving the Timkens for emergency use and Lea and I installed the 
     new Chinese units.  We were able to find German inner bearings and 
     replaced the old ones just to avoid problems.  Check your bearings and 
     surfaces everytime you get the chance!
     
     The brakes looked great and I noticed that the wheel cylinders are 
     quite different than those on my '66 bus.  Anyone know if they are 
     interchangable?  Next, on to the rear wheels.
     
     I've ordered a bunch of stuff from Bus Boys recently for this '63.  
     They were the only source out of over a dozen, nationwide, that had 6v 
     oil temp units!  I also bought complete tie rod assemblies, starter 
     bushings, oil temp sender, brakes, pedal pads and some other stuff I 
     can't remember but the point is that even though Jim has been sick for 
     weeks (I hope you get well soon, Jim) Bill is running the show with 
     great efficiency, at least by my standards.  You will not get them via 
     e-mail.  Do it the old fashion way and pick up the phone.  There are 
     questions to be asked, personal chatting to be done, that just won't 
     work yet on the computer.  
     
     I strongly recommend that we do not forget the personal element.  I 
     wish we could see and hear each other on this list.  It's so easy to 
     forget who we are when dealing with keypads and electrons and to 
     become someone else which I suppose is fun from time to time but let 
     me tell you how disappointing it is to meet someone you've &quot;talked&quot; to 
     via e-mail and find out that they're really not who they were 
     pretending to be.  That's one of the reasons I liked Dave Easterwood 
     so much when I met him.  He is the real deal, a genuine lover of old 
     VW's and people.  Honest and true.  No pretenses, just good old Dave.  
     Sorry for the ramblings.
     Ray
