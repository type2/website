Just like to let you all know I put a set of Bridgestone RD-603's on my '84
Vanagon in 1991, and a new set last year. They are great! I put about
45,000 miles on them. I just put a set on my newly aquired '69 pickup and
they're great on it, too. You should be able to get them for approx. $75
ea, not including mounting and balancing.
