&gt;   my engine is running on from 2 to 4 cyl randomly and only at low RPMs
&gt; get it on the interstate and it cruises effortlessly at 60-65 mph, for
&gt; hours.   today for example, starts and runs very rough, has almost no
&gt; power, drive about 2 miles to entry ramp of I-95. maybe a quarter of the
&gt; time it seems to run normally, the rest of the time the engine is rough.
&gt;
&gt;   I have checked everything I can think of, swapped out dizzy cap for new
&gt; one.  wonder what else to check, pretty sure it is electrical because it
&gt; smells flooded when it is rough. heck can't even figure out which cyl(s)
&gt; are missing, pull the plug wires none of them makes a difference.???

one other thing that has crossed my mind, possible hyd lifter intermittent
failure to pump up?????    how do you check this out???
