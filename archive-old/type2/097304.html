Subject: Mix in gas tank &amp; Happy Hollidays

Hello Volks

First of all I would like to thanks to all of the listies who helped me with
my question about oil in a gas tank, and thanks again for the support about my
country situation.
I going to take the risk and going to use the mix of gas and two stroke oil, I
guess that a ratio of 120:1 will not cause any major problem to the engine, in
any case we have more things to be concern of than a little carbon deposit on
the spark plugs.
I wish a happy new year to all of you, and I hope the next year bring good
things and more VW for all of us.

From the sunny lands of Caracas Venezuela

Roberto
