Hello Friends,

I'm considering a camper based trip abroad for the first time (all my
previous trips where car/B&amp;B/hotel  based).
I own a self-camperized vanagon and enjoy it very much touring my own
country (Israel), but getting it to another country is a completely
different story - it's extremely expensive (~$1000) and time consuming (3-6
days, and of course they can take it only to nearby countries - Greece or
Italy).
In short, it's impractical for the relatively short trips I'm planning (2-4
weeks).
So I would like to get info where can I rent such a Westy, small RV  etc.
around the world.
My interests are mainly the USA and Europe. What I'd like to know is:

1. Rent/return locations/requirements (and if I have to return camper to
same rent location to avoid return charges).
2. What model/how many beds/Available facilities.
3. Cost.
4. Minimum rent duration.
5. Service availablity on route.
6. Any other interesting info you might have.

please respond either privately or to the list.
happy camping!

shalom,
          Amnon

Hi all;
I'll be touring Germany in September and have the same question. Anyone knows
of a Westie rental place over there?
