Hi type2 fans !!

We've joined the mailing list today and got a question right away !
My wife and I own a '79 single cabin pick-up.
We've just hung the motor in place, next week we'll start connecting all =
the electrical wires, does anybody have a schedule of the wires ? we =
have a 1800cc motor with dual carburettors.

Thanx to any1 that is able to help us !
