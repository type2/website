Subject: Re: [T2] Jalousie windows plastic clip thread


&gt;I found the plastic clips. the (im sorry I deleted that
&gt;message, so Im not sure who sent the original)
&gt;
&gt;They clip on the top of the screen.  They are a U
&gt;channel with the outside (inside of the van) edge
&gt;longer than the inside (window internal).  On the
&gt;outside is has a finger grip to pull the screen down,
&gt;and more importantly, it has a groove that catches the
&gt;bottom lip of the frame.  This groove locks the screen
&gt;firmly against the frame preventing all movement.

Could somebody post a pic of these clips someplace? A profile shot would be 
nice so the rest of us could experiment with replacements.

I can't even visualize what these things look like.

Thank you!
