&gt; I ordered an &quot;Easybleed&quot; brake bleeder tool from IPD. They're actually a
&gt; Volvo specialist located in Portland, but they have a nice catalog with a
&gt; lot of useful tools and products. One thing I saw in their catalog was a
&gt; &quot;seat heater kit&quot; I immediately thought of the van, because I have to
admit
&gt; one of the nicest features of my '97 Golf K2 is its' seat heaters. They
&gt; provide almost immediate heat to a place that really needs it.
&gt; Now the kit in their catalog is described as an &quot;inexpensive alternative
to
&gt; original equipment&quot;. So it doesn't look like it's just Volvo specific.
&gt; The kit is made in USA and includes &quot;one seat cushion heater element, one
&gt; seat back heater element, finished wiring harness and stylish illuminated
&gt; switch.&quot; It says further that it installs with common hand tools in about
an
&gt; hour. Cost is $72.50/seat. Part number is CQ9K3600
&gt; I couldn't find these on their website www.ipdusa_dot_com. I haven't called
&gt; them, but I'm wondering if this could be fitted to a bus. I have sheepskin
&gt; covers protecting my seats, and it seems like these could fit nicely
&gt; underneath. Has anyone ever used a kit like this?
