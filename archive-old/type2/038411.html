Subject: more on distributors...

hello all,

I have been doing some research on how to time a 71 bus distributor with
just the advance hooked up.  I cannot find the reference that said using
7.5 btdc is kosher.  Mainly i was looking for my own curiosity as i cannot
remeber if that timing should be static or at idle...

It makes sense to me, and i plan to try it, but i cannot find a source. I
wanted to point everyone to an article on dejanews or the archives, but i
cant figure out how to search for this... (timing and any other keyword i
can think of just op up too many replies.)

a lot of good information is located at teh following URL that will help
you determine the proper course:

So, take my tip with this caveat... I plan on trying it, i heard it from
someone i trusted (but whose name does not spring to mind) that it should
work well, but i take no responsibility if you just set your engine there
and it doesnt work right... experimentation will be neccecary.

good luck,

Steve
