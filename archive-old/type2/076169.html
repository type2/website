Subject: 411 Engine

How easy would it be to install the engine out of a 72
411 into a 74 bus. Are there any differences in the
moustache bar mounting points n the case( like the
difference and beetle and 68-71 bus cases)? just
thought i'd ask since my bus needs and engine and
nobody seems to want to buy my $500 411.
Thanks,
Tyler
