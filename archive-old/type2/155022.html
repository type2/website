Subject: Re:too hot heater fan

Problem solved...well, sort of.

Folks, I was reading the front page of the &quot;food&quot; section of the newspaper
last week and they were doing an article on how convection ovens are really
great for cooking faster.

Had a pic of the inside of the oven with...wait for it...a *fan* inside the
oven, cause that's what it does.....move oven temperature air around without
melting.

Bingo! Might not be 5 billion cfm, but might help and certainly wouldn't
melt from the temps our heaters put out.

Only one problem....finding one that runs on 12 volts.


Cheers, dave

Check with your local appliance repair parts place and see if they sell just
the fan, not the whole unit.  Or keep your eyes peeled for someone throwing
away a more or less modern stove and act like any good bus owner and
scrounge , ah, I mean recycle, the fan :)
