&gt;I would not expect clearance problems unless you get
&gt;_way_ off of the beaten path.  Mexican topes (and bordos) are
&gt;certainly attention-getters, but they are seldom more than 3 inches
&gt;tall.

It's not so much the roads that are horrible so much as the livestock in
them...

Traveling in Chihuahua state (well off the beaten path but not way off) we
had a lot of trouble with these huge rural concrete drainage ditches. They
are just as meticulous about marking these as they are about marking all
the other hazards. 8)

If you aren't paying attention those ditches can come out of nowhere and if
you're going fast enough you can get aloft (you are expected to drive
through them crossways). I can imagine situations where the propane tank
would take the stress and there would be a lot of sparks. However, I'd sure
rather have a fractured propane tank than a gasoline spill if I were going
to shoot sparks...

But this seems a fairly unlikely hazard. Non-unlikely hazards include
encountering a mechanic who is a hack, and driving into a steer.
