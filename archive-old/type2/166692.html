Subject: Re: [T2] Taco grief

This was discussed (in brief) on the itinerant-air-cooled forums a  
month or so ago:

http://www.itinerant-air-cooled_dot_com/viewtopic.php?t=1717

The final post, from Colin, the itinerant air cooled mechanic  
himself, is as follows:

&quot;It just requires a little futzing to keep things centered as you  
gently persuade the red ring to expand against the case hole as it  
rolls around the bevelled edge of the taco plate. If it goes crokked,  
back off a bit on the 10mm bolts and go at it again.  Colin&quot;

Good luck with it!
Zack
