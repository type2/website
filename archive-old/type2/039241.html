Jay, If you need the complete t-stat assy. bracket, etc. you can get the 
parts from Ron at the Bus Depot. I've compiled the part #'s you'll need to do 
the job from scratch, assuming that the whole kit-and-kaboodle is gone: 
T-stat 021 119 159A  Screw 271 821 767  Sealing washer 021 119 995  Bracket 
022 119 155  Cable 021 119 751 Union Nut 070 119 765 Bracket Washer 021 119 
175  and if you need it, Pully 021 119 769A. Please install your t-stat ASAP. 
It is IMPARITIVE to the correct functioning of your eng. and will go a long 
way to insuring its long life. I'm going to post this to the List, in hopes 
that if I've overlooked something, one of the other members will catch it, 
and keep me from looking like a complete hack!
Good Luck,
Parker
