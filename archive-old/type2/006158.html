My RMMW replacement boots cracked within a year of installation.  I called
them to complain, and,  without any argument, they credited my card for the
amount, inlcuding shipping (I think).  Then they told me not to bother
mailing the cracked boots back to them!

I wasn't happy about having to redo my CVs, but at the same time, I was
impressed with RMMW.
