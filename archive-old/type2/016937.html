Guys,
May I comment?

I will relate a stupid bonehead that I did on my VW that resulted in
'Still Nothing But Crank'.

I replaced the rotor and cap late one night with not enough light.

After a failed start, I remove the cap and saw that the rotor had not
seated completely on the dizzy shaft.  It had scraped the inside top of
the cap.  It was perhaps trying to spark on two or three but not all
four.

I measured the inside of the cap to where sparking should occur and
gently tapped the rotor down to a correct distance.  Replaced cap.
Restart no problem.

I hope this helps someone to prevent the same bonehead mistake.
