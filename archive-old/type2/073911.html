Subject: Re: [T2] Living out of a Bus....HELP! BUS-A-THON!

I have a 78 westy poptop......

I would plan on cooking dinner, which got the interior pretty warm and cozy, 
I would sit in my sleeping bag as I ate dinner which warmed it up nicely......
if you have a good sleeping bag once it is warm your body heat will keep it 
warm.....

this was in Germany , temps below freezing at night.......
ice on the windscreen in the morning, but on the outside......

once in my old splitty bus we had ice ion the inside opf  the windscreens, 
now that was cold !!!
