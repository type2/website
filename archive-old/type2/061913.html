What paint do you guy's (+ gal's) for rust prevention &amp; priming? 

I've had good luck with two primers.  For clean metal body work that will show, I use Dupont Variprime available from professional autobody paint shops.  It's self etching.  A couple of thin coats and you can spray regular sandable primer over it immediately.  For areas where I need heavy duty rust prevention and/or rusted areas where I can't remove all the rust and sand blasting isn't practical, I use Rustolium brand heavy duty red primer (spray cans or brush on). The problem with the Rustolium is that you have to let it dry for about 2 weeks before you can use auto primer and paint over it.  Otherwise it may lift.  But it's worth the wait.  I've used it in fender wells, roof gutter rails, under the plywood floor, battery platforms, under the windshield, inside front doors, etc. and have had no return of rust.  Don't know if you can find these products in Europe--might be under different names.  Good Luck!

Alan
