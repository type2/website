Subject: Re: [T2] Convert walkthrough to a bench seat?

In our 71 stock camper bus at one time, I took the front full width
bench seat from an earlier bus (60's) and placed it where the passenger
seat was by using a strap hinge on each side of the seat pedestal, and
cutting a notch in the pedestal for the rear bottom of the seat so it
would sit flat.  It could swing forward to get beneath it.   We used to
fit 6 to in that camper- 2 in the back next to the stock closet, and 1
in the jump seat, and 3 in front.  I then dumped the bench seat and
extended the jump seat by using the stock stool/seat top and building in
a seat/potty base between the jump seat and the stock fridge cabinet. 
This seat had a swinging back made from the tire cover fabric.  It
hinged from the sink/fridge cabinet. That way we still had the walk
through (climb through) and carried 6.  In your case, consider a 3
person bedseat from a 74 or 75, a jumpseat facing rear, and the kitchen
unit next to that.  A cooler can be place between this unit and in front
of the driver side rear person. The kitchen will fit in along the side
even with a 3 seater in back, and then you can have the jumpseat and a
walkthrough- i will email a pic of our 78 which is like this minus the
fridge unit- which lets you put a cooler anywhere.
