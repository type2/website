to eyeball their
&gt;distributor for the '72 bus.  This distributor is a rebuilt Bosch
&gt;vacuum-advance model distributor.  The VW number stamped on the body was
&gt;211-905-205-Q and the NAPA part number was #48-916.
&gt;
&gt;Can anyone tell if this VW number is the correct one for the '72?

NO  a 211 Q is for a 71 1600 upright engine bus. Wrong!
Your distributor should be a 021 905 205E and should have a dual vacuum unit 
on it.


&gt;Also, my single Webber progressive setup has a vacuum port on the manifold.
&gt;  Would this be the correct place to tap the vacuum if I bought and used
&gt;this distributor.

NO  it would be correct for the inner nipple, retard side, of the 021 E dual 
unit. The outer nipple, advance side, has to go a vacuum port above the 
throttle plate = no vacuum at idle.
