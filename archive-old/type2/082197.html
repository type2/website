Subject: trying this lights thing...

List, 

i am still battling with the lights issue I have had on my 71 westy. I have 
front turns, headlights, parking lights all around. No rear brake lights or 
turn signals. The rear side markers aren't hooked up at all. 
This is what I have. In the rear left light i have two brown ground wires 
going to the respective ground spot on the light housing. One of these is a 
stand alone wire, one is wrapped with another wire, appears to be green or 
grey with black stripe. This wire (green/grey) has current and is going to 
the left prong on the housing. it joins a stand alone wire yellow with black 
dots. Then alone on the right prong is the Black with yellow stripe wire. I 
am getting current to all those correctly except the brown ground wires (as 
it should). I reviewed the wiring diagram so graciously sent me, but the 
colors dont appear clear the diagram. It looks as though one ground and one 
of my positive current wires now running to my rear taillight should be 
running to the side markers. Any idea which ones. 
I am at a bit of a disadvantage as i dont have anyone to press the brakes for 
me as I check the currents. 
Any help is appreciated! 
Thanks all!
Melissa
