&gt;&gt;Use the specs for a 1971 VW bus, from the Bentley manual.


&gt;Thanks Roland but I don't have Bentlys and given the state of the Canadian
&gt;dollar, I think I'll save my little money for something else (like an 1835).
&gt;Can someone give me the four wheel alignment specs?


From page 2-35 of the Bentley book

Wheelbase: 2400mm (94.5in)
Turning circle: 12.3m (40 ft 4in)
Track at front: 1395 mm (54 59/64&quot;)
Total toe with wheels not pressed: +15' +- 15' or 0.0 to 3.3mm (0 to 1/8
in)
Total toe with wheels pressed: +5' +- 15'
Pressure applied to wheels: 15 +- 3 kg (33 +- 6lb)
Maximum permissible difference between tow with wheels pressed and not
pressed: 25'
Front wheel camber in straight-ahead position: +40' +- 20'
   Maximum permissible difference between sides: 30'
Toe-out at a 20 degree lock to left and right (wheels not pressed): -2
degrees 20' +- 30'
Offset between stub axles: max 0.80mm (1/32 in)
Caster angle of a wheel: 3 degrees +- 40'
   equals the camber difference of a wheel on a 20 degree lock to left
and right: 2 degrees +- 25'


The only other adjustments that I could find were the torsion bar
adjustments which varied depending upon the vehicle

Hope this helps,

Scott
