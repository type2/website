My bus does the same thing but always starts if I am parked on a hill and is
tempermental when parked on the flats.  Whis I knew how to fix this.  Read
something about a Ford relay but don't know anything more about it!

  Headed off for our destination and when we got there it was
&gt; dead again.  This time we push started it and went to our camping spot.
When
&gt; we woke up this morning just for the fun of it I gave the key a turn.
&gt; Suprise, it started right away and has been fine all day.  I don't have a
&gt; clue!
