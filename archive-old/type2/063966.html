Subject: Vanagon thermostat

My 2000 vanagon AC is missing the little wheel that lets the thermostat turn the
corner.  The cable is too short too, so the engine is always at full cooling.
This situation can prevent the motor from warming properly in winter time. Bad
for the engine and bad for the cabin heat.  Does anyone know of sources for
these parts other than VW???  John Jensen in Annapolis
