hey volks,

i too got my new heater boxes from ron. and yep, they're purty! they even
have heat fins, unlike the neater boxes that came on my new beetlemex 1600dp
turnkey, which is a seperate posting :-/

anway, ron warned me that the heater cable attachments are on the wrong
side, but i persisted :-)  so now i'm trying to figger our a way to wire the
heater cables up for the new boxes in my '60. any suggestions?

&gt;Ron, the new German heat exchangers arrived today. In words of one
&gt;syllable - WOW!
&gt;People, when was the last time any of us saw a brand spankin' new German
&gt;Heat Exchanger?That's what I thought. Well, I just received two brand
&gt;new ones courtesy of Ron. They arrived in perfect shape.
&gt;
&gt;Ron, thanks again for a good deal. I'm tempted to get another pair. What
&gt;are the chances? Any left?


I have about ten pair left at this point.  I will try to get more when
they're gone but am not sure if I can.
(And even if I can, it won't be for a couple of months.)
