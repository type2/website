Please post the answer here, as my new engine in the 78 is having the same
problem, I have been slowly weeding out items but haven't found the cause

&gt; My '81 Vanagon has been having some problems (cold) starting after its
&gt; winter storage...  the engine turns over fine, but within a couple of
&gt; seconds it just dies.  After five or six tries, the engine will idle very
&gt; low for about 10 seconds, then rev up to normal idle speed.  Once the
&gt; engine is warm, this problem disappears.  I've searched previous digests
&gt; for similar symptoms (although I couldn't seem to find this exact
&gt; problem)... here is what I've come up with:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Any other ideas here?  The problem is starting to get a little annoying and
&gt; I had to put any more stress on my starter than necessary.  Thanks much!
