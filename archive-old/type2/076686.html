Subject: Re: [T2] Accelerator/Idle

&gt; Scott,
&gt; 
&gt; Good post!  I very much agree, as you may guess.  The only nit-pick I have
&gt; is that the decel air take-off is between the AFM and the throttle body,
&gt; so that air is metered, it's just not regulated by the throttle.
&gt; 

i was speaking of the aux air valve, not the decel valve. the decel valve
could be the source of, or part of the problem chuck is having too,
especially when you read the part about:

&gt; But, when I accelerate and let off the gas, I get a longer &quot;hangover&quot;
&gt; effect from the gadget that is supposed to do that. It takes a lot longer
&gt; than I believe is normal to return to a lower idle.

the way to check the decel valve is the same: just remove it temporarily and
see if anything changes. in the same way that the aux air valve should have
no effect on a warm engine, the decel valve should be doing nothing at idle.
when working properly, it only allows air to pass through it when manifold
vacuum causes it to open, i.e. when you are running along and take your foot
off the throttle. if the return to idle is very slow, or non-existent, the
decel valve may not be closing properly. i took the decel valve off my
motor, but this may not work for everyone.

if i may add, the important thing when troubleshooting is to test only one
component at a time.
