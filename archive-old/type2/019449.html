Hi,

Two things:

Dwell is inversly proportional to width of point gap.  Since dwell is the
degrees of distributor rotation while the points are closed, increasing the
point gap decreases the dwell.  If your dwell is at 44, decrease the point gap
to attain a dwell of 50.  Changing the gap also changes the timing and any point
gap change requires a timing adjustment.  Over time, the gap closes up due to
the rubbing block wearing.  If greased properly, the rubbing block should wear
very little.

Timing:  If you run a mechanical advance only distributor, total advance should
not exceed 31 - 32 degrees at 3500 rpm.  The 009 has a total of 10 degrees of
distributor advance which eguals 20 degrees at the crank.  The 050 has 14
degrees at the distributor and 28 at the crank.  Using the 050, you can time to
3 or 4 degrees initial advance.  Easier starting and low speed operation.  In
the heavy bus, a lower initial setting gives better bottom end while the vacuum
advance gives a cleaner burn and increases milage while cruising.  If you have
the double vacuum distributor, pull and plug the retard hose (On the side of the
vacuum pot towards the dist. cap.)  Set the timing to 7.5 degrees.  The
mechanical distributors react only to engine RPM; the combination distributors
react to both speed and load.

Keep smiling,

Mike
