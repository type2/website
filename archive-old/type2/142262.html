Subject: brakes and broken bleeder valve

I finally got my brake hoses from BD the other and got them installed on one
side of the bus. I was cleaning out the bleeder valve screws and broke the
bottom one off. It looked pretty rusted and I was going to replace it, but
once the wrench went on it and a little pressure was applied, it snapped. Has
this happened to anyone and if so did you have any luck in using some screw
extraction tool on it? The top screw looked good, but the bottom was almost
gone, so I am not sure how hard it will be to get out.

Anyone got any advice on how to get it out without doing to much damage or
would I be money ahead (and safer) to just get another set of calipers? I
already have a set of rebuild kits for the calipers if needed.

Thanks,
Corbett
