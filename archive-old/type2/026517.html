&gt;Tom Wilson, in his book,  suggests packing the oil pump with grease 
&gt;to prevent cavitation at initial start up.  I've never done this before.

I've always packed my pumps with Vasolene as recommended in most of the
rebuild books.  Always works fine for me, but then I've never done one
without it.  And Vasolene is going into to the pump for the new 2.0 I'm
building now.  I also (as you should) drain the oil and replace the filter
after the first several minutes of run-time.

Oil pumps &quot;suck&quot; the oil in from the pickup tube.  I think the theory on
packing them is that with an &quot;empty&quot; oil pump, it may take a longer time to
get oil up the tube because the pump won't form a good enough vacuum with
only air in there.
