&gt; Now I
&gt; must ask, I noticed that out of 3 pumps I have  about, only one has this
&gt; little screen in the inlet end- as this a stock inclusion in the fuel
&gt; pumps?  I don't see its need if you run a filter before the pump.

Are they the same? I noticed that 0 the 580 463 016 pump is slightly longer
than 0 580 463 010. The 016 pump has the screen, the other doesn't.

The screen must have a purpose because I once pulled the 010 pump that was
still behind the a and all sorts of rust flakes poured out.
