Subject: Re: [T2] Odd vacuum problem

&gt; I put on my Steve Dolan cap and low rise jeans ;-) and hooked up a vacuum gauge and sure enough the vacuum had dropped to 15&quot; from the normal level of between 17&quot; and 18&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; It appears I have a leak but as the engine warms up the leak goes away. If I park for 30 minutes the engine runs fine next start but if I wait 4-6 hours it's back to running rough again at startup.
&gt; 
&gt; Any clues why this leak seems to be temperature related?

could be heat related, years ago I had the opposite problem, ran fine
until it warmed up then engine would stall, slight leak  that only opened
up when rubber got soft, yours could be closing up when it gets soft?

only took me 4 months to find, , good luck
