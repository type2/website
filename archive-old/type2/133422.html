&gt; I have determined that the engine in my bus is from a type 4 car. Although
&gt; unusual the only fault really is that I can't get it to stop leaking oil. The
&gt; oil seems to be leaking from the case seams. I haven't done a compression
&gt; test, but I can. It is a pretty strong runner, minus the oil leaks. I have no
&gt; idea how many miles are on this engine.

the engines are basically the same and there is no real reason that they
can not be used, I used a 1700 411 engine for my spare engine for years,
put many thousands of miles on it

&gt; I had intended to take my time and completely rebuild this engine, however I
&gt; have lost any workspace to store or work on the new engine over a period of
&gt; time. My budget is gone now and I can't afford much new stuff at all. I have
&gt; purchased a complete engine seal kit. My question is:
&gt;
&gt; Should I keep running the type 4 car engine that is in the bus now, with oil
&gt; leaks and just be patient and continue to build the new found engine out of a
&gt; box over time?

I would do that.  as long as the engine in there is working and there is
hope that the new rebuild will get done, what have you got to lose.
