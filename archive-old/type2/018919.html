(snipped stuff)
&gt;..in desperation one night I took a small pair (about 5 inches &gt;long) of SS
medical clamps - these are the kind you see in the &gt;O.R. of MASH, &quot;nurse -clamp,
sponge, crescent wrench&quot;...anyway, &gt;these 'clamps' look like small scissors
with blunt tips to &gt;clamp things and to hold a needle for stitches, they &gt;have
notched locking tangs near the finger holes.

Ray - you've just run into what I think is one of the most
useful general-purpose tools I've ever found (I'm an aircraft
mechanic). Most common name is Kelly clamp (although I've heard
several other names) I used to volunteer as an EMT years ago, and the ER was
getting rid of a bunch of &quot;junk&quot; one day...I (being a certificated packrat)
took the box home and threw a couple pair of clamps in my box at work. They're
great for soldering work, for (like you found) snaprings. I've cut the head
off of a Q-tip, clamped it, and used it as a &quot;pinpoint lubricator&quot; for grease.
I've gotten o-rings out (careful not to crush 'em, though) and dragged that
one S*B washer that dropped WAY DOWN there out with them. I've even modified
one set with a grinder down to an edge and used them as a makeshift pair of
wire cutters when I couldn't get a normal pair in...
All and all, good price, and usually (if you get used hospital
equipment) good quality.

So, the next time you wind up in the E.R. after dropping an
engine on your foot, make your trip productive...see if they
leave anything unattended :^)
