Hey volks!
            Well its been awhile since ive pondered the list  but here it 
goes.  Last week did a tune-up, plugs, timing, points,oil , ... you know the 
particulars.  Set timing way to high, and went out of town on a camping 
trip...well...45 minutes into the trip I overheated, vaporlock, blown crank 
seal, .... in the middle of nowhere  no less.  (took AAA 5 hours to get to 
me!)  Well 225.00 later, ive got a new starter, crankseal,timing adjust, carb 
cleaning and some other particulars.  AND today I was driving down the road 
and I heard a very bad noise, pulled over and inspected and I had blown a 
plug out of the socket, I don't know if this is from not tightening well 
enough or what.  My mech. says I have blowby and  he could be right with the 
oil ive been using lately. Soooo, is this normal i put another plug i(gapped) 
and it seems to fit snug, oil is coming out form under the oil filler tube 
below the cap(is there a gsket there?) thanks volks!
