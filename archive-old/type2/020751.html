   I found just that in a 1600 Bug engine I overhauled. Busted chunk of piston
skirt, pieces of ring...all firmly seated in the thick black goop (sludge) that
covered the bottom of the case (inside, of course...the outside looked worse). One
cylinder scored beyond belief, looked like the piston had been flopping around in
there (DPO musta thunk &quot;Three cylinders, yeah, it'll run like that.) Why it didn't
seize is a mystery to me, but it was running on three when I got it.

&gt; &gt; Sure looks like a chunk o' piston ring to me. Not a good thing. Get ready for
&gt; &gt; an engine pull.

&gt; Now, how can a piece of piston ring find its way to the crankcase without
&gt; lots of bad noises happening?  It's probably possible, but short of a
&gt; major chunk of piston breaking off (which would be really impressive in
&gt; the oil screen) I can't see how it could happen.
