Subject: I have a Cot Question

I picked up a cot on Eb** and it happened to have the 57 1/4&quot;
 3 -sided galvanized poles. Storage won't be a problem but has
anyone used these on a 1979 Riviera ?
I have the closet /sink behind the driver and the fridge/stove
behind the passenger so I don't have much room to put the seat
back. I've only seen cots in pics so I've nothing to go by.
Sooo......if someone could P mail me some pics I would surely
appreciate it or if this is a no go I'll put it back up for sale
for listmembers first.

Thanks ~Andy (Eb** junkie)
