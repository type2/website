[...]Sounds like a problem I had one time at a stop light.  When I went to
take off the engine just raced when I let out the clutch.  To make a long
story short, it turned out that the axle nut had backed off enough to allow
the brake drum splines to sheer off so the axle didn't have anything to
turn.

If she's in Minneapolis and needs a mechanic have her try J.A.C in Ramsey.

&gt; 
&gt; Hello fellow list members~
&gt; 
&gt; My roommate from here in San Francisco is out traveling for a few months, 
&gt; and after making the trek from SF to Or and back, then on to Minnesota 
&gt; without a problem, the westy is suddenly in need of help and she isn't 
&gt; having much luck finding an air-cooled VW guy to work on it.
&gt; 
&gt; She has a 74 westfalia, and it was running wonderfully before she left.
&gt; What is happening now is &quot;When I finally get it started, it feels like the
&gt; 
&gt; back end is sitting in Mud, it just doesn't want to move&quot; - her words, not
&gt; 
&gt; mine.
&gt; I do not even know what that could be, so if anyone has any suggestions
&gt; for 
&gt; a good Minneapolis VW guy that could come out and take a look, or she
&gt; could 
&gt; get in touch with that would be super!
&gt; 
&gt; She has a place to stay there, so it isn't an AIRS issue, but she will
&gt; need 
&gt; to get it running to find a temp job and such for the period of time she 
&gt; will be staying there.
