Thanks for all the helpful hints/advice!!! Now, who is recomended for the window chrome and window rubber kits?? I was told that there is a vendor out there that sells the whole kit (chrome/rubber- windshield-back) for about $200.00 to $250.00 US. Does anyone know who this is?? I think that the chrome part is made of plastic??
