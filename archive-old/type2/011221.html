Hey Volks,

I had a question about the timing on my riveria. I had the timing light on 
it for a quick look last weekend and noticed it was way before TDC. I don't 
have the timing scale on my type 4 cause it has rusted away but I ordered a 
new one from my flaps and it should be here on monday. Bently says that the 
engine should be at 10 ATDC, and by a quick look at someone elses scale 
noticed that mine was down around 5-10 BTDC. How does this affect my 
running? I am not getting enough advance, is this why? I am gonna do a full 
tune up in the next week, but I just wanted to understand what effect this 
was having on my engine. Engine is a 1.8L Dual carb setup.

Thanks,


Jeff Mckenna
