If you look into this site it clearly states that one of the original 
designs had a combined starter/dynamo arrangement. The photo looks 
pretty convincing. So what?

Well, Ford  have just finished putting together a new system for their 
diesel vans. When you stop, say at traffic lights, and go into neutral, 
the engine shuts off. Put it back in gear, by by the time you release 
the clutch the engine has restarted. It all comes down to a little box 
of electronics, and a very high power starter motor.

Odd thing is, they had this , and I quote, &quot;wonderful idea that no-one 
has ever used before&quot; of combining the starter and alternator in one 
unit. I realise Porsche had a DC setup so technically what they are 
saying is correct, but does anyone else think Ford are being a bit rude? 
I happened to tape the TV documentary this was on, and watched again 
just to check. They (well, their engineer on the show) definitely claim 
that using a single unit as generator and starter &quot;is an idea no one 
else has used in a vehicle before.&quot;

Talk about re-inventing the wheel....
