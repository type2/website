Subject: EveryBus photos up

Hey all,
I've got my EveryBus photos up.  Go to my web site,
http://www.type2_dot_com/~bartnik and you will see the link on the left.

Putting these photos up has made me realize how horribly out of date my
site is so I'm gonna be working on updating some of that too.  

If you have any photos up on the net, let me know and I can link to them.
Likewise, if you've got trip reports, e-mail them to me if you want me to
put them up on the site.

Also, if you can identify the Buses and owners in some of the pics, let me
know that too :-)

Thanks

Sean Bartnik
