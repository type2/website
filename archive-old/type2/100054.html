Subject: Re: [T2] Buses in Knoxville area??

I would think that for repair or maybe some parts/info, this would be a good
connection:

Dean's Import Service
(865) 673-0765       200 Pearl Pl
Knoxville, TN

Service that appears to specialize in aircooled vws.  I have never used
them, though.


&gt; Any good Junkyards or places with Buses to see in the Gatlinburg/Knoxville
TN
&gt; area.  We're going to Gatlinburg for a few days.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone from there?:  Leaves a pretty color yet?
