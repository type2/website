solutions? Aircraft remover. (It's paint stripper, but when I first saw the
name of this stuff I thought, &quot;if it can remove a whole airplane I want
nothing to do with this.&quot; Turns out they're just talking about the paint. &gt;&gt;

Might want to remove the fenders when using this stuff...Any stripper/
residue left in the seams is gonna resurface later when it's resprayed
with ugly results.
