Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Vanagon Seat Armrest Removal

Hi Don,
My front seats are in poor shape and I'm considering either
rebuilding the ones I have (stock) or purchasing some Vanagon seats,
as you have done.  I have a couple questions for you:
What year Vanagon did you take those grey seats out of?  (And, as a
corollary, what year were the less comfortable brown seats?)
How much higher, if any, do the vanagon seats sit than the stock
seats?  I'm pretty tall and I'm not sure if I could handle being much
closer to the roof than the stock seats (in good condition) put me.

I hope you figure out how to cover up the gash in the seat where the
armrest used to be.  Perhaps a unique sewed on patch.

That brings me to the last question does the Vanagon armrest sit at
the same level as your vent armrest that's on the door panel?

Thanks a bunch.  Nice write up, by the way.

Zack

More comfortable than the early Vanagon seats that were in there, plus
they're gray instead of brown.
