Subject: [T2] High Country Bus Festival Report

WOW!  What a weekend,  thanks to all of the folks from the list that came 
out and made this the best HCBF yet! I never got an &quot;offical&quot; bus count, but 
approximatly 85 buses/vannagons/eurovans made the climb up the mountain this 
year!  The oldest bus: 1958 newest: 2000

There was actually a good small group of us there early on Thursday night 
and by Friday night there was a MASS of buses at the base of Grandfather 
Mountian.

Saturday Morning the folks from the Full Moon Bus Club cooked Breakfast for 
us all under their incredible tarp awning!  Thanks guys for doing such a 
wonderful job of filling our belly's.

It did rain for about 5 hours saturday afternoon but it cleared up for 
dinner and the VW Family Feud later that night.  Richard Dawson's drunken 
cousin Blistered Dawson arrived in &quot;high fashion&quot; to host the show.  Thanks 
to all of those who partipated as contestants and a special thanks to our 
celebrity judges: G. Gorden Liddy, Arnold Swartzenager and Sahra Geller.  
After the FUED we had some great door prizes and later in the entire valley 
was lit as an old case was tossed into the bonfire.

We had 53 buses stick around to join us for our caravan along the blue ridge 
parkway to Price Park.  What a site to see so many buses!  I have a bunch of 
pictures that I am going to post on the net hopefully tonite.  As soon as 
they are ready I will send a link to the list.

One kind-of bad note.  This may be the last HCBF at this location.  There 
were a &quot;ton&quot; of complaints from the other people in the campground and some 
bus people about the DRUMMING that went on untill all hours of the night.  
This campgound gives us the entire field, but we need to remember that there 
were lots of RV's and campers very close to where we were.  The people that 
stayed up drumming all night showed no consideration for the other people in 
the campground.  I had to ask the drummers to stop on saurday night at about 
1am.  I worked really hard to put this thing together and 98% of the folks 
were being very cool.  I would hate to see such a great thing ruined by the 
actions of a few.

Long story short,  if we are allowed to return to Grandfather Mt Campground 
next year there will need to be STRICK obsevance of the 10pm quite 
hour.....no drumming past 10.

Thanks again to everyone for comming out and hope to see you all at HCBF V 
next year.

thanks,
buddah
