Subject: Re: Blowers for cabin heat on Type 1 engines

Mike,

A very interesting point, however I believe it has a fatal flaw.  There is
much greater positive pressure generated in the exhaust system than the
vacuum (HE -&gt; Blow -&gt; Cabin), or the pressure (blow -&gt; HE -&gt; cabin)
generated by any of these fans, so I believe that in either case exhaust
gas that can enter the 'fresh air' system will do so.  Maybe there is some
truth to the argument you present, but I would guess it accounts for a
single digit percentage change when the engine is running at speed.

&gt;                                  HEAT EXCHANGERS -&gt; BLOWER(S) -&gt; CABIN
&gt; 
&gt; Is there a reason for this?
&gt; 
&gt; I do not like this approach because the heat exchanger tin is not air tight. 
&gt; Pulling air through the heat exchanger can also suck in fumes.  Pushing air
&gt; through the heat exchangers reduces the changes/volume of fumes (blower-&gt;heat
&gt; exchangers-&gt;cabin).  Maybe this is why Type 4 engines have blowers set up this
&gt; way?
&gt;                                  BLOWER -&gt; HEAT EXCHANGERS -&gt; CABIN
