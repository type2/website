Subject: Good source for '79 transmission?

Hi all,

My '79 bus is missing 4th gear, and I would like to find a suitable
replacement unit, but am curious to gather opinions on the best source
for a rebuilt transaxle, or possibly a good working used unit.  Flipping
through VW Trends I see a few retailers that offer rebuilt trannys in
the $650-700 range, but wanted to see what folks on the list might
suggest.  Thanks in advance,

-Ross
