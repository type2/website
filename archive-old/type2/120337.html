Subject: Re: AMP meter and shunt

Did you mean to write 1 mA? There's a ton of
difference between 1 MA and 1 mA. 1 MA, (megaampere),
is 1,000,000 amps and 1 mA, (milliampere), is .001
amp.

&gt;I recently bought a 4 amp meter that has these
&gt;instructions:

&gt;&quot; Westinghouse panel meter manufactured for RCA with
&gt;a range of 4 amps DC. Please note that a .25 ohm _at_ 5
&gt;watt meter shunt is required. The basic movement of
&gt;this meter is 1 MA. &quot;
