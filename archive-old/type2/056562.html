Hi all,

I have a '74 Westphalia with a full camping kitchen. However, the fridge doesn't work, or at least I can't get it to. It is the type with some sort of gas and a noiseless compressor. At one of the shows, someone suggested turning it upside down and then plugging it in. I tried it, but no luck. Can anyone give me some advice on getting it working.

Thanks.
