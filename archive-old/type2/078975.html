Subject: Re: [T2] 78 gas tank job pics now up

Dave,

Good pics!!!

I'da mentioned the hidden screws but they are so legendary on the list
that I thought &quot;everyone knows.&quot;  Sorry  :-(

On cleaning... most radiator shops and some machine shops can boil it
clean for you and should only charge in the neighborhood of ~$20.  Most
will also suggest coating the tank.  I had the tank in '73 (from a '79
originally) boiled out and coated, but when I got the tank from the '67
boiled out, I decided against it.  Here is why:  Back in the 60s they
installed a coating regularly that was absolutely gasoline-proof.  I think
it was shellac based.  This worked dandy until alcohol was added to
gasoline.  Shellac disolves in alcohol and the coating screwed up a lot of
engines.  These days they are using a coating that is both gasoline and
alcohol proof, and it stands up to current gasolines just dandy, BUT....
who knows what will be added to the gasolines of 2010???  and will it eat
the current coatings???  All in all, I decided against.

                           Steve Dolan
