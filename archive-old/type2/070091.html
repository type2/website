Subject: HEAT CAUSE

HI Everybody,
EXcuuuse me for beating a dead horse, but I HAD to have the last word on
the cause of heat in an internal combustion engine.  I work in the
engineering department and got the word straight from a PhD in Mechanical
Engineering.   He emphatically states that the main cause of heat is...
  * COMPRESSION *.  Yes,  the burning fuel and friction do add to that,
but I believe Craig Standley and Andy McKinley came closest to the
answer;  expansion of gasses brings about cooling, compression: HEAT.
One post gave an example of the paper that was compressed until it burned.
BTW, The rings are pressed against the walls of the cylinders with a lot
more force when firing.

SO THERE! =:)

Drive On,  Chris '69,'70,'71 and assorted bugs
