Subject: westy with heart problems

Hey all....I wrote about a month and a half ago about my Westy.  I was 
traveling and lost power and it was stalling out.

On the advice of the list, I replaced the points, the cap, the plugs 
and cleaned my fuel system (replaced the filter, cleaned the lines).

And she's running like she was when I got her....except, she still 
won't hold an idle.  I have to keep the accelerator down in order to 
start her and she stalls as soon as I remove my foot.  Even when 
cruising at highway speeds, she stalls when I take my foot off the 
gas.  She sounds better, and she's got power back, but it'd be a lot 
cooler if I could keep her running.

It's like I need a damn defibrillator.  CLEAR!   BZZZZZZZZZZ!

Any ideas?
