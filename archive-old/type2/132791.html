Subject: RE: [T2] Fiberglass Insulation

Ive read this about fiberglass (in the archives).
It raises the question, was the existing fiberglass that is in my Westy put
in by the factory??? It sure looks old enough!

Eric
   without the crappy fiberglass that holds every lick of moisture that
every invades your van's body. (My only seam rust on my 89 was from
fiberglass that got wet and started rust from the inside.) DO NOT USE
FIBERGLASS!

  I've heard that it also really helps with sound transmission and road
noise.
