Subject: aftermarket headers

Folks,

I have a 78 std with the stock muffler setup.  I have a section
of header pipe that ties the two heater box flanges together, but
since I bought it from a list member it did not come with a muffler.

I am considering using it when I rebuild, but am concerned with the 
diameter of the hole at the collector in the middle...it seems to be 
smaller than the normal exhaust pipe!

Anyone use these and have comments on the type of muffler to buy as well
as performance issues?  I am also interested in how loud a particular
muffler that would fit this would be as I like the sound(or lack of it)
from my stock muffler.

Cheers, dave
