Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Heat - CO and Slow Death

Hi All,
Still not up to getting back into the posting thing and such, but just 
wanted to make comment on one discovery we made during our most recent 6 
month and 21,000 mile Western North America trek over the past few months.

Mary Beth and I encountered temperatures down as low as 12 degrees F, with 
below freezing nights being the norm on many weeks and in many altitudes 
and areas.

We used the Coleman Black Cat heater as our heat source. It did a great job 
for us, and we are still alive, so I am wondering about all the threads on 
CO death and the such.

As for ventilation and combustion air, I left both front vent windows 
cracked just a bit.

Our CO test canary never did fall off of his perch, but he did freeze to 
same sometime around midnight on the night of October 4th, way up on Bear 
Tooth Highway going NE out of Yellowstone.
That was the night we got caught in a really big white-out of snow, sleet, 
fog, ice, and white knuckle steering wheel grip.

BTW,
I now see that Coleman has a smaller catalytic heater out for sale that 
resembles the size/configuration of their single burner stove and mounts to 
a small propane bottle in the same fashion as their small single burner stove.

BTW(2)
We found Wal-Mart to just about always be the best $$ source for the 1 Lb. 
propane bottles at $2.00 per bottle. You can locate the local Wal-Marts by 
just following a big RV at around sunset. That is where these &quot;rigs&quot; go 
during their night hours when out on their great &quot;wilderness camping 
experiences&quot;.

Thanks to info Mary Beth and I obtained from some Canadian boys I met at 
the July Seattle BowWow VW thing, however, my first Canadian purchase upon 
&quot;heh&quot; entry was a 5 Lb. propane bottle from Canadian Tire when we hit 
Vancouver Island.

That 5 Lb. jug is just a perfect size for extended VW camping and is small 
enough to not be a pain in it's claiming storage space or being loaded and 
unloaded every day.

Having a VW bus and living in one for 6 months is just a super experience !!!!!
