Subject: picking the right muffler set up?

I am in the market for a new exhaust system for my 1971 Westy. I went and 
purchased a stock Brazilian set up and the thing won't fit properly so I am 
going to return it and I am thinking about getting a header set up with a 
single quite pack muffler. Here is my question I have heard bad things about 
Bugpack and Empi systems I am interested in anybody's opinion on this. I was 
looking in the Rocky Mountain Motors catalog and saw a Kadron extractor and 
muffler set up I am not to familiar with Kadron do they make good products or 
not. Is this something I should consider getting or should I run away from 
it? Any info would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks
