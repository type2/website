&gt; I have a 78 transporter whose engine recently siezed.  I am getting

&gt; many more features then the one I have now for only 1500.  So now I
&gt; want to sell the 78.  Would that be the right decision, having put
&gt; all that money into it, and if so, what should I sell it for.  The
&gt; body is decent, surface rust and 3 or 4 rust through spots, and the
&gt; engine is brand new rebuilt.  It's a decent bus over all, and could
&gt; be fixed up with minor work.  Any help you guys can provide would be
&gt; awesome.

It's tough to get the money out of a recent rebuild in a bus. You
already know about your 78 so the 69 will be a big question mark till
all it's troubles get settled. Unless there is a driving reason to get
the 69 I would just hold onto what you have and enjoy driving it.
Keep in mind that if the 69 blows the engine soon that 1500 bus turns
into 3000 quick.
