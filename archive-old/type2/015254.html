Message-Id: &lt;3.0.5.32.19990329191651.007d1d60_at_atlcom_dot_net&gt;

Unfortunately, I need to sell my Westy for financial reasons.

Please email me if interested or for more information.  I am asking $4800
OBO, which is what I have in it.  I live in Cartersville, GA which is about
an hour North of Atlanta.

The majority of the story is on my webpage (
http://www.atlcom_dot_net/~drlathem ) and the photos of the camper on my site
are the day I brought it home.  Since then it has been driven about 20
miles.  Yes, 20.  While it did not need it, I went through it
mechanically....Here is what has been replaced...The bus sat indoors for
YEARS, like in the teens of years, so just for kicks I have replaced...The
camper has been in my garage ever since I brought it home.  Never stayed
out overnight.

WHAT HAS BEEN DONE
* Had heads rebuilt (stock 1600SP) by Steve Sands in Atlanta
* Removed and flushed gas tank.
* New VDO Fuel Sending Unit.
* Replaced P&amp;C's with new Mahle cast 85.5s.
* Replaced Main seal.
* New pushrod tubes.
* New Alternator.
* New carb.
* New Blue Coil
* New 009 Dizzy
* New Compufire Ignition
* New plug wires and plugs (duh)
* New Sachs Cluth, P.Plate &amp; T/O bearing
* Replaced starter bushing
* Replaced wire from battery to starter as well as battery ground cable.
* New German muffler, pipe, etc.  Complete kit.
* All New German wheel cylinders
* All New German Hoses
* New German Master Cylinder
* New Brake Shoes
* New Front Inner and Outer wheel bearings
* New Door Seals ( driver &amp; passenger doors )
* New Exterior Mirrors
* ( 4 ) NEW Yokohame 356 Tires ( Did I mention less than 20 miles?? )
* New Flasher Relay
* New Bosch wipers ( worth the $4800 alone )


PARTS STILL IN THE BOX
* New headlight switch
* MANY MANY bulbs and fuses (like 4 of every bulb)
* ( 4 ) New German CV Boots (3 originals are cracked)
* New Rear wheel bearings ( Outers are German, $50 each )
* New WCM Top Seal (front and rear)
* New Sliding Door Seal
* New OEM Driver's side window regulator ( does not need it, but it was a
good deal )
* New Voltage Regulator ( does not need it, just a precautionary measure)
* Curtain patterns and some really sweet looking green plaid fabric that I
thought would look good.
* Seatbelts (rear) from a junkyard donor.  Front ones are intact.

WHAT DOES NOT WORK
* Turn Signals and Hazard Flashers.  I bought and installed the new relay,
but something is awry.  I have not spent much time investigating it.  All
other electrical stuff works (backup lights, high/lo beams, interior light
when door is opened, etc, etc.)
* Faucet is broken.


BAD THINGS / GOOD THINGS
* Under the driver's feet is ZERO rust.  NONE.  The camper was repainted
YEARS ago so I cannot comment about what MAY be under the paint, but there
is no surface rust showing.
* The metal under the battery tray has been replaced once upon a time.
* The MEATHEAD DPO cut 6x9 ( yes six inch by nine inch ) holes above your
head in the roof.  Yes it is under the camper top so it did not bother me
when I bought it.  I was going to have the holes welded over.  It is an
interesting conversation piece.  I have a nice headliner that I was going
to replace the Holy one with.  It came from a junkyard, but is in great shape.
* The windshield washers work. ;-)
* No, I don't have the tent. :-(
* There is one small tear in the front of the back seat.  Other than that
the interior is beautiful.
* Original floor in excellent shape.
* Front mat is flawless.
* Runs like a top.
* I just finished the brakes and have not bled them yet.
* Camper was wrecked (right rear) at some point YEARS ago and the DPO
replaced the rear bumper with a pre-68 one.  I like the look personally.
There is no sign that the camper was ever hit IMHO but I am not a body man.
* No radio.
* Tables are flawless.
* Canvas top is torn along one &lt;?&gt; side where some Bozo raised the roof too
quickly not thinking that the canvas was probably dry and brittle.
Bozo...Bozo...Bozo. ;-)
* I have the original beautiful child's cot. (looks as if it was never used)
* Upper cot is in beautiful shape as well.

I think that is it.  I have receipts for everything that I replaced and
also have the old part that was replaced.  In some cases the old part was
good ( carb e.g. ) I just chose to buy a new one.  I have no documentation
that the 56K is the original miles other than what the PO told me and based
on the condition of the camper, I believe him.  The last title was in 1980,
which lines up with the rest of his story about it being in storage indoors
since 1981.  I have the letter from VW, and the motor in it IS the original
motor...Again lining up with his story.

Thanks for taking the time to read, and please email me with questions.
