&gt;Tonight I replaced the broken coupler in my smog pump pulley 
&gt;assembly (which is being used to drive an A/C compressor) with 
&gt;a modified (bwahaha) hockey puck.  Pictures and text for your 
&gt;amusement are located at:

Now THAT'S the kind of engineering creativity that I love about buses and
their owners!!!  If you get bored up North sometime, you can remove your AC
drive pulley (aka hockey puck) and your shifter rod (aka hockey stick) and
go for it!  And the use of the empty pizza box to catch the shavings has to
border on shear genius.  Thanks for sharing the pics and the adventure.
