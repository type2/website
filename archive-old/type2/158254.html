&gt; is it worth it to install sound deadening materials in the Bus?
IMHO, yes.  For less than $200, I thought it was totally worth it.  I
can actually have a conversation with my family on long trips now.

&gt; what would 60 pounds of dynamat and jute backing do for it? And
&gt; also, I'd really like to hear from anyone else who's
&gt; attempted to make their Bus's interior more quiet. 

The details of what I did are kind of fuzzy, as I don't have my logbook
with me.  Regardless, I bought a roll or 2 of something Dynamat-like
(it wasn't brown-bread, but it was in that general price range) and 2
large sheets from McMaster-Carr.  I put Dynamat stuff in the doors and
side panels.  I put the McMaster under the wood floor and under the
rock'n'roll bed.  I didn't put any above the engine (as I'd planned to
put a hatch in), but it still made a huge difference.  The noise of the
tires and wind at highway speed is louder than the engine.  So, I need
to put some on the tirewells (especially in front).  The family can all
participate in a conversation now even at highway speeds.  We couldn't
do that at all before at practically any speed.
I'll dig around for my notes and invoices to see what I bought.  I did
a bunch of research before buying.  I don't think the McMaster stuff
did very much other than reduce vibration, but every little bit helps.
