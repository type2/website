Subject: adjust valves 2.0l

We just picked up a 1978 bus engine used with tranny. To change the seals on 
the push rod tubes do you have to remove the rocker assembly or can you slide 
it through, also if you have to remove the rocker assembly when done should 
we adjust the valves. If yes to adjusting the valves is it the same as solid 
lifters as for these hydraulic, thanks anyone
