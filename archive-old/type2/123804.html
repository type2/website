Subject: RE: [T2] Killing mold?

&gt;&gt;&gt;  Also, if anybody has a line on CHEAP 5&quot; &amp; 6&quot; foam for the bed, I'd
greatly appreciate it. I found soft foam on eBay for around $100 +
shipping (lots of shipping!), but am hoping for even cheaper. I can't
help but wonder if we couldn't do a group buy of good firm foam and get
it cheap enough... &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;


Have you checked the phone book yet? Sounds like a silly idea for a
shop, but here in South Seattle we have a place called &quot;foam rubber
city&quot;. They make all sorts of Foam. Any thicknes, firmness or size. It's
the place upholstry people goto for it. I'm sure every major city
probably has one. Should check it out and see whatcha find. You could
probably at least save the price of shipping. :) Unless of course you
live in a small town. :(

Cheers
