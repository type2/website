Mr. RNeithammer's explanation of the inner workings of the 71 sliding door
was impressive and good reading!

On the question of missing latch parts:

Others in this thread have suggested the lever to unlock the hatch from inside
exists but is hidden by the paneling. I suspect the original tug knob was a
plastic &quot;T&quot; affair which was easily
broken and that restorations by POH-folk merely covered the access.

I could be wrong, but suspect it you remove the paneling you will see all
you need to pop the hatch from inside--sans pretty plastic thingy.
Keyword: Suspect.
