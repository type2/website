hello,

that is the question at hand. i need to replace my pop-top canvas before the 
burning man festival later this summer, basically because mine is currently 
so brittle that when i went to unzip it for the first time, it tore a whole 
along the seam rather than actually unzipping it. im guessing once the top 
is up in 65mph+ winds, its going to shread itself into little pieces.

when i went to get the new canvas, i have the option of Acrylic Canvas or 
non-Acrylic Canvas. it is about $60 more for the Acrylic Canvas, but i am 
not really sure what the big difference is going to be. what is the original 
one made out of? any pros' or cons to one or the other?

thanks for any tips, hints, or tricks.

Christopher
