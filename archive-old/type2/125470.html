Subject: RE: [T2] Engine swap?...that's nothing

&gt; There's a long time VW bus guy here on Long Island that 
&gt; went about swapping engines in a much different manner. 
&gt;  He bought himself a Toyota van and cut the body off
&gt;  about 12 inches above the floor.  Then he cut the 
&gt; body off his 66 bus and grafted it onto the Toyota chassis.  


I saw this frankenmobile at Kampers Near Knoebels last year. It's really
something!  I have to hand it to him for originality and welding
ability, even if it isn't actually a Volkswagen.
