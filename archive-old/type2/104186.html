Subject: Re: [T2] intake leak

WD-40 will work, so will carb cleaner. Don't spray the
dist or spark plug's it might torch off. just in case
keep a fire bottle handy, I have had this problem so I
know the fire bottle works, hehehe(big dummy me, big
as the dist is I couldn't miss it.) but I found my
vaccume leaks, some were a little bigger. Just be
carefull and you should have no problems. Phil
