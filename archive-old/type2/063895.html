Subject: Bumper/Engine removal Part 1 (long)

The sceen: One 68 Westy parked in garage rear facing out - One 68 Station 
Wagon backed up to it with about ten feet between em.

The Task: Remove engine from 69 and transplant into 68.

Sounds easy....right?

Not so fast.....

First I removed my old trusty 1600sp (with hole in top of case :( ) from 
the 68, as usual this was very easy as it had been done 4 times in the last 
2 years.

Then i set my sights on the 69 (1971 - 1600dp).  I had purchased it about a 
month ago for the engine, spare tranny, doors, windows, front end..etc.

All the bolts that are associated with the rear bumper came off except one 
of the main 4 that hold the brackets to the frame of the bus.  The nut that 
is welded to the inside of the frame member had come loose. :(  Not having 
a torch I was stuck.   So I turned my attention to the point where the 
bracket attaches to the bumper itself.  Sprayed with LW and proceeded to 
get one of 2 nuts off, the other just spinned in its recessed square hole. 
:(  Since it was a flush head I didnt want to damage the surface of the 
bumper, so I punched a guide point for a drill, and proceeded to drill the 
head off the bolt.  Ok bumper off, rear deck off,  wires disco'd, rear 
brace un bolted, fuel line off and plugged, accelerator cable off.  Only 
Four bolts left :).

There was no bolt for the starter,  the bolt accross on top was put in 
without washers and was flush with the surrounding surface of the bell 
housing. :(  Impossible to remove in the vehicle.  The other two nuts at 
the bottom were a dream to remove. :)

Unable to seperate tranny and engine I figured to remove both at the same 
time.  A first for myself and a little scarry alone.  Put both bottom nuts 
back on.

Removed tranny ground strap, starter wires, CV's at tranny, shift linkage 
and 2 bolts at front of tranny (FIF).  Went to rear, grabbed exaust and 
pulled.  Floor jack under engine did ok, jack stand under tranny collapsed 
and the whole assembly dropped on the 2x4s under the jackstand.  No damage. 
:)  Slid my 4 wheel dolly under nose and pulled whole assembly out from 
under bus.  Used Vice Grips to remove top bolt, removed others, and then 
pulled engine and tranny apart.

Mounted the engine in the 68 and went for a test drive. :) :) :)

Thanks for the Bandwidth.......
