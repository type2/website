Ok here's another tangent. Some one mentioned that VW 
Trends trademark was dead. That reminded me of the last 
issue that I bought. One of the editors was complaining 
about his bad custmer service experiences when dealing 
with &quot;large corporations&quot;. He went on to say that he 
much preferred to deal with the small businesses that 
support the acvw hobby. Oddly enough he had nothing to 
say about how VWoA hs been going after some of these 
samll businesses. Gee, you don't suppose he didn't 
mention VWoA on purpose do you. Maybe the editors at VWT 
just haven't heard about these beloved small businesses 
being threatened. Or maybe he didn't want to bite the 
hand that feeds his mag a fair amount of ad revenue.

&gt; &gt; I can't figure out what all of the extra verbage is on the &quot;bug&quot; one 
&gt; &gt; though.  It makes it sound like *all* of the people who currently have 
&gt; &gt; &quot;bug&quot; in their trademark are in violation.
&gt; 
&gt; A trademark is &quot;generally distinctive symbols, pictures, or words that
&gt; sellers affix to distinguish and identify the origin of their
&gt; products&quot;. The blurry area here gets into the idea that most people
&gt; wouldn't mistake something completely unrelated to automobiles w/ VW
&gt; if the word &quot;bug&quot; was used. From what I understand these laws were
&gt; simply put in place to protect unscrupulous peoples from cashing in on
&gt; a recognized product. VWoA seems to be going well beyond what they
&gt; should be doing to protect their &quot;mostly&quot; good name. I have a tough
&gt; time understanding how something like &quot;bug&quot;, &quot;bus&quot; or even &quot;beetle&quot;
&gt; can be trademarked in this way. It is usually used simply as
&gt; identification.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think (&amp; IANAL) that these words can fall under the &quot;common
&gt; word&quot; umbrella where it kinda means a lot of things, such as the term
&gt; Unix to identify many different branches of OS. Someone who mentions
&gt; &quot;bug&quot; or &quot;beetle&quot; will cause whoever is listening to identify that
&gt; converation w/ a small air-cooled rear engine vehicle build by VW. Not
&gt; get it confused w/ say a corvair, etc.  I'm guessing this is where the
&gt; lawyers are getting their leverage.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I noticed after I figured out how to work the site, they even trademarked
&gt; &gt; &quot;Drivers Wanted&quot;.
&gt; &gt; The world is getting weird, dave
&gt; 
&gt; getting? man, it already is :)
