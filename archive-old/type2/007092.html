Look in the April issue of Hemmings.  Several rebuilders listed.  For
example Vanco, South Gate , CA 1-800-256-6295.  Don't know anything
about them.  Prices start at $75.

&gt;I am a brand new owner, and probably in over my head, but please 
&gt;bear 
&gt;with me.  I have tried researching this dilema and have questions.  
&gt;I 
&gt;understand the servo works on a vacuum, should be connected to my 
&gt;manifold for proper operation.  (71 Westy)  In crawling under I find 
&gt;the 
&gt;vacuum hose plugged off.  It doesnt seem to be connected.  So how do 
&gt;I 
&gt;troubleshoot?  The brakes do not have any power, they seem to be 
&gt;dragging.  Bad servo?  Is the servo even connected or necessary?  
&gt;Bad 
&gt;master cylinder?
