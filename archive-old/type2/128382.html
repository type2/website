Subject: carb trouble 34pict3 

Hi there,
 
I'm running ad dual port 1600 with a 34PICT 3 in a 69 bus and I can't get it to Idle. It behaves like a vaccum leak but I'm almost posetive that everything is sealed. I'm considering rebuilding or replacing the carb. I wan't to fix it right and for good and I don't mind spending a little money. any advice on the best way to go??
 
Mick
