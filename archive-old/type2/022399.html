&gt;I have 2 heads to match up,both are 021-101-371S 1800 41mm x 34mm
&gt; one head has 54cc's in each cylinder,, the other has 56cc's... the 56cc
&gt;head has approx 1mm step that looks like a shim but is cast as part of the
&gt;head,,, is that a california head? Should I machine out this step?

That sounds rather large for a stock combustion chamber - I had what I thought was a stock set of 1800 heads and they measured 51cc.  The head with the step has not been milled - they came that way from the factory.  You need both heads to match so machining the step out is probably your best option.

&gt;I have 1.8L carb engine with 92.98 pistons,dished pistons, and I do not know
&gt;my deck height right now,, is that standard,, or should I measure it,

Measure it.  Mine was shy of Wilson's spec by a few thou for some reason.

&gt;I guess i cannot calc my compression ratio with out the deck height,,, but
&gt;how do i figure in the dish in the piston,,, do i have to cc that also?

Yes.  I seem to remember the 2-liter dish as being 15cc but I think the 1.8 dish is much smaller - maybe 5cc?
