Subject: Stripping w/brake fluid

Hi all,
 OK, I've been around long enough to stick my head up and
ask a potentially stupid question without fear of being flamed too
badly.
 
 I've noticed over the years that DOT3 brake fluid does a serious
job on paint. Yet I've never heard of anyone using it as a stripper. I   
have
to assume there are reasons for this like environmental hazards or
something to do with it's hydromorphic (is that what it's habit of   
absorbing
water is called?). I'm asking because brake fluid is cheaper and far less   

nasty on the nose and eyes than the spray on caustic strippers.

TIA
