Subject: Re: three point retractable seatbelts?

I don't know about type 2s, but they were available in bugs.  The inertia
reels brackets also work nicely to put the inertia reel belts in the front
seats of baywindows using the original attach points.  You could also
fabricate suitable brackets from 1/8 steel with one simple bend.

Old bug belts are getting a bit old, but the same inertia reels were used
in VW and Audi products for years after the aircooled epoch.  The right
and left reels are identical, so your best bet is to rob the passenger
seat belts from two different donors, as they will be much less used than
the driver's side belts.

For the rear seat, I used VW sirocco rear seat self-adjusting belts.  They
required the fabrication of 3 inch extenders to get the buckles in the
correct place, but the effort was worth it.  The belts are very easy to
use, even for my small children.

I don't have a good solution for the middle seat yet.  I think I will end
up using the Sirocco adjusters again, but with the addition of longer
straps to reach the floor mounts.

&gt; Maybe they are available through VW with a Euro spec parts number. Personally, I don't put too much trust in any JC Whitney product.
