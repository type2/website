Subject: Re: [T2] Anyone got an extra Jalousie window pane?

Yes and it is yours - where are you? Cost of postage.

It's going to be tough to send though - they are VERY thin. I give it a 1 
in 10 chance or arriving intact.

A glass shop (commercial grade - not the hardware store) can cut a 
duplicate and temper it for you for about the same cost as a used one sent 
to you I'll bet.

&gt;I took my Jalousie windows apart to have the glass tinted, and to clean them
&gt;up before installing the new seal kit I got. Well, I pulled to hard one time
&gt;and busted one of the pane's, and cut the $_at_#_at_ out of my self to add insult
&gt;to injury...or maybe that is injury to insult:-(
