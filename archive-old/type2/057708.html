    I don't know, I've sure never done it that way -- I take the engine
out by itself. Seems like one heck of a lot more hassle to drop the
tranny at the same time. I don't let it drop down either. Leave the
tranny in place, unbolt the engine from the tranny and unbolt the rear
member from the &quot;frame&quot; and lower it down on a tranny jack. Disconnect
everything first, of course. And then I jack the car up on each side a
bit to allow me to pull the engine out from under.
    What's the hardest for me is getting that mother back up on the jack
when I put it back in. You have to push it under the car, then use a
long pry bar and fulcrum and gradually block it up on each side until
you can fit the jack under the engine. Now how the hell you would do
that with a tranny attached, I have no clue. Sure don't want to try it
by my lonesome. 

     Was ever so much easier with my '68 -- on that you can pull off the
bumper and then the part of the body right under the rear hatch (just 4
bolts, but now it's welded in), and then have the engine on the jack and
just wheel it in -- I totally removed a running engine and put it back
in 4 times in one afternoon that way, having it running each time in
between (trying to find the right combo of oil cooler seals for my new
external oilcooler). 
   Not now -- now it's about a two day even to get the sucker back in --
of course, I'm also 30 years older. Damn time anyhow!
    
   Utah Phillips has a great line on his CD &quot;The Past Didn't Go
Anywhere&quot; where some old fart in a a bar says &quot;I don't care how 'New
Age' you get, old age gonna' kick yer ass.&quot;
