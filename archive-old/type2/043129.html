Subject: RE: wood storage

I always carry mine in a bag. At campsites there is never any firewood for
20 miles and in the bush I dont like to diturb stuff too much so I leave
wood where it is. Aust. is still primitive enough to like a fire of
consequence, me too, I figure a proper campsite is one where you can light a
fire.

&gt; In England and much of Europe, if you're on a proper camp site
&gt; you probably
&gt; can't light a fire anyway, other than a BBQ. If not you'd be
&gt; sufficiently in
&gt; the wilderness to gather your own wood on arrival, if you think a fire is
&gt; necessary. Me, I've never lit a fire when out in my camper. Do
&gt; other people
&gt; do this?
