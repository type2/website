&gt; &gt; These are not
&gt; &gt;  a common failure item and I don't carry them, although if you couldnt 
&gt;use
&gt; &gt;  your old ones or find a junkyard pair, you could use another pair of 
&gt;the
&gt; &gt;  rear housings for the front.  They'd have bulb holders built in which 
&gt;you
&gt; &gt;  wouldn't need (hence the $19.95 price) but would work.
&gt;
&gt;Speaking of side lights, I have been thinking for some time about 
&gt;installing
&gt;the
&gt;rear light assemblies in the front reflector lenses and connecting them to
&gt;the
&gt;front signal lights on my 71 Westy.  This would help anyone that might be 
&gt;in
&gt;my blind spot know that I want to make a lane change.  This is a real 
&gt;problem
&gt;on the So. Calif. freeways.  Off course, the light would probably only be
&gt;visible at night unless I used halogen bulbs.  I thought I could get away
&gt;with the brighter (and hotter) halogen bulb if it is only blinking for a
&gt;short duration.  Or I might just rig it to the running light system like in
&gt;the rear (like the side lights on my '64 squareback).  Has anyone tried any
&gt;of these ideas?
&gt;

I was going to respond to Ron about 'putting rear housings on the front' but 
I never did. Unless you want to drill a 3/4&quot; and 2 1/4&quot; holes in your door!, 
you can't use rear housings with lights. All you have in the door are 2 
screw holes for screws that go thru the reflecter. The rear housings are 
held on by snapin clips in holes, one above where the screw hole would be 
and the other hole below where the screw would be. The short screws on the 
rear only go into the housing to hold the lens on.
