Subject: Re: [T2] Bus to Fiero engine?

Gentlepersons-
                       Speaking of VW engine conversions, anybody have an 
update on Smokey
Yunick's adiabatic engine. I'd have thought with the rise in gas prices, 
someone might've
got it into some sort of production...Anyone else know of it or its status?
