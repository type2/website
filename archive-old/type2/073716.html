Subject: Re: [T2] My 2.0 L has nice big bearing flakes in the sump. :-(

Courtney Hook sends:

&gt; Any comments, suggestions, opinions on doing this ? Any chance the mains are
&gt; gonna be ok and there is a way to test them? I thought maybe I could luck
&gt; out and just redo the rod bearings without splitting the case? (Ha ha, what
&gt; wishful thinking). Sorry guys and gals, just had to vent.

With all that bearing material floating around in there, the safest thing is
just to say &quot;screw it,&quot; split the case and change all three bearing sets.
Mebbe even get the little ends on the rods rebushed while you're at it.
You've got the engine on the ground anyway, why take chances?
