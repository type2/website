&gt; Hello all,
&gt; FYI
&gt;    I just went to look for EXTEND at the &quot;Home Desperate&quot; near my house. I
&gt; looked all over and couldn't find any so I was looking at other products I
&gt; could use as a substitute. Well surprise, surprise EXTEND is now being
&gt; packaged as Naval Jellly Rust Neutralizer at least that's what it says on
the
&gt; back of the can. It comes in both spray and &quot;goo&quot; packaging.
