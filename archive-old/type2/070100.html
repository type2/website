When I had to cut a hole for my new fridge, I used a plain old hand 
held electric sabre saw with a fine tooth metal cutting blade.  
Made a nice cut, but needed some de-burring.  Take your time, cause 
the sabre saw cuts real fast.
Versions available (called a scroll saw) that the blade can be 
rotated while cutting to give a smoother cut.  Relatively cheap.
I tried an electric Skil saw for the straight cuts, took longer, screamed 
louder, made worse cuts than the scroll saw.

&gt; (no air compressor) to cut sheetmetal cleanly?  Would a Dremmel tool work on
&gt; sheetmetal or is that used for thinner/softer metals?  I've seen air
