Yes, but if you had one of those things now in an NOS box you'd have a
valuable collector's item!

&gt; You mean I can't use my &quot;200 MPG Fish Carburettor&quot; on my VW engine...
&gt; (Or maybe two, and get 400 MPG... ?-)

I actually saw a report on one of these in an old &quot;Foreign Car Guide&quot;.  At
the time they weren't advertising really outragious MPG numbers.  I think
that Fish was a bit more legit than the snake oil purveyors, at least at
that time.
