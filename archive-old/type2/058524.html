Subject: '68-72 cab floor repair piece needed

Does anyone know a place that actually stocks the front driver side cab 
floor repair panel for a 1968-72 bus?

I ordered (and paid for) one in March from Ron at the Bus Depot and here 
it is in September and I still don't have a repair panel.

I tried Wolfsburg West a while back &amp; they told me they don't stock them 
yet.  I did not try RMMW because Ron said that is where he is getting it 
from &amp; they will send me the first one they get in.

Dave
