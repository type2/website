Subject: torsion bars adjustment
Message-Id: &lt;l03130301b3b65a856672_at_[206.163.180.45]&gt;

i just came back from a wheel allignment. i was told that the rear
camber/toe numbers were problematic. however, nothing could be done short
of replacing the torsion bars.

upon further inspection in the bently manual, i found torsion bars can be
adjusted. please help me understand whether this adjustment is possible -
to help rectify possibile premature tire wear back there.

i phoned the allignment shop and they &quot;believe there is no adjustment for
this model&quot;.
