Hi all:

Because of some uncertainties concerning my rebuilt Vanagon heads I 
decided to cc one set of heads and measure the deck height of the engine 
they are going on.

The combustion chamber volumes on either head are fairly close on the 
same head, but not so close between the two heads.  The volumes range 
&gt;from a low of 52cc's to a high of 57cc's.  I can get some of the 
difference back because the deck heights on one side of the engine are 
greater than the deck heights on the other side, so I end up with 
calculated compression ratios of

       7.01     7.00
       7.33     7.14    

If I omit the cylinder head to cylinder shim on the low side the 
calculated ratios change to

       7.43     7.44
       7.33     7.14

which gets them a little closer together and provides a little more &quot;oomph.&quot;
Is there any problem with running them this way?

TIA.
