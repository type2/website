Subject: Re: [T2] Upper Trailing Arm Removal - Replacement

&gt;1. It is all but imposible to remove the upper trailing arms if you have
&gt;not removed the bump-stops from the horns of the beam.  These bump stops
&gt;are held on to the horns by a post and clip arrangement.  To remove them,
&gt;look inside the horn and you will see a clip much like the ones that hold

Something to make this a bit easier that I don't recall doing when
we did Steve's is that if you can come by a BIG crescent wrench,
as in the 24&quot; one I happen to have you can get sufficient leverage
to lift the arms of the stops with say the beam out on the ground
if you need to swap the arms off then for some reason.  Of course
on the car you can raise em with a floor jack and bang them off
outwards with a big ole hammer.

As for removing the alignment bushing.  I'll add heat, lots of heat, like
steve said, don't need to save the ole ball joint so break out the torch,
and use a nice big quality puller like the Snap On set he has.
