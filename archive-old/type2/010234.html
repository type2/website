On 10/3/99 10:00 PM, dworkin_at_mtolympus.ari_dot_net thus spake:

&gt;
&gt;bus that has had a &quot;hurry-up&quot; rebuild thrown in at the last minute.  The
&gt;odds are very good that you would run into more problems hundreds of miles
&gt;from home that would spoil the trip at best and leave you stranded and

A quick note on this subject: I wouldn't necessarily rule out the bus for 
your road trip, assuming several conditions are met. 

1. You must not have a tight schedule. 

2. You must have large amounts of funds available, that you don't mind 
losing, should problems occur(this can include family with large amounts 
of funds that don't mind lending it). I'd say somewhere on the order of 
$3-5k, just to be safe. If you have it, you probably won't need it, but 
if you don't Murphy sez you will...

3. You must have insane amounts of patience and an extremely healthy 
karmic history.

4. You must be the type of person who enjoys adventure. Adventure 
includes being stuck 10 miles east of Vaughn, New Mexico, on a seldom 
travelled state road, at 4 AM, on the 4th of July. Ask me how I know...

5. You must be the type of person who keeps a positive attitude in the 
face of adversity, and revels in your ability to solve problems on the 
fly. It would also be helpful to read the Muir book mentioned by Mark 
from cover to cover, so that you can take advance notice of problems, and 
fix them under the shady trees, just like ol' Johnnie says...

If, and only if, all of these conditions can be met, then perhaps this 
sort of road trip is feasible. Otherwise, drive the Dodge.

;-)


Peace,
