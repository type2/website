Subject: Re: [T2] Alternator belt

These are call Tri-Square and they come in various sizes.
I bought a set of 4 to get the one I needed to remove the CV joints.
I think the set of 4 was about $9.00 but as singles they were about $4.95
each. (Chief Auto Parts but everybody has them.)

&gt; What size 12-pt tool is this in mm?
