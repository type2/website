Subject: Re: [T2] Gen light stays on -- goes out after engine revs

&gt; Sounds to me like you accidentally disconnected a wire from your generator

Hmmm...well I was quite careful when I connected all the wires to the 
alternator, and I tried two different regulators (I suppose they could both 
be shot).


&gt; I have a 61 Ford Econoline truck that has had a number of 
&gt; generator/alternator problems and when the control unit or the
&gt; generator/alternator go or a wire gets knocked loose, you'll get the light
&gt; staying on.

My light only stays on until I rev the engine a bit. Then it goes out...


&gt; Get out a volt meter, check to see if you're getting a charge 
&gt; at the battery, should read 13-14volts or so. If you're getting a charge, 
&gt; but the light is staying on, could be the control unit. If you're not
&gt; getting a charge, I'd check the wiring from the generator.

Well, I'm pretty sure the battery is getting charged, because I've put almost 
200 (mostly city) miles on since installing the new engine and it starts 
fine. I'll still check the voltage, though.
