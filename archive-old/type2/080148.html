I know there probably won't be any takers, but I thought I'd give the list a shot before I put these in the paper.

I have a 1988 Trooper with less than 15,000 miles on a rebuilt engine and a 1970 Type 1 Ghia (pretty rough) that I am going to sell so I can by a Type 2 (ideally with the camper interior, but no pop top-but I'm not that particular.) 

Sooo, if there are any listers that have an extra and might be interested in a swap, email me off list and I'll give you more details. By the way-to purchase outright the Trooper would be around $2500 and the Ghia I'd let go for about $1200.

Thanks, Bill
