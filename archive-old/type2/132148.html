&gt; This if for any other wet-behind-the-ears bus owner who buys a bus with
&gt; low mileage tires and thinks &quot;cool, I won't have to replace those for a
&gt; long time.&quot; Um....WRONG!  I learned the hard way that tread life or
&gt; even sidewall appearance is a poor indicator of tire safety. These
&gt; tires looked better than the ones on my daily driver and yet...BOOM.

One time my bus developed the ability to turn tight circles all by itself in
the parking lot.

I couldn't locate a tire store that was willing to take a look at the bus
because they didn't stock 185R14 tires (this was back in 1995). I went to
the VW dealer in Coquitlam and they had a pair so we put the bus up on the
lift and immediately obvious was a large bubble that had formed in the
middle where the tread was beginning to separate. I was driving Hwy 1 that
day and probably narrowly averted a highway blowout.

Tires have to be stored in the dark with a preservative. Even if they are
you have to give up on them after a number of years...

Here's an extreme case: I threw away a set of nice looking Michelin X tires
last year that were bought at the dealer more that 20 years ago.
