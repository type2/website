Subject: Re: [T2] Disc Brakes and type 1 engine


&gt;   Is that still a type one engine? If not how hard is it to do the
&gt; conversion?
&gt;
    Yes, the 71 has the dual port bug (type one) engine with dog house
cooler and assorted parts. Disc brakes (computers have disks with a K) are
great, and pedal pressure is low. In the USA, 1971 was the only year that
had disc brakes and the bug engine; however, the bug engine was still
available in other markets after 71.
