Subject: 78 ECU in a 76?
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hi all,

    I recently wrote about my electronic control unit problems in my early
76.  On list member replied saying that he had one from a 78.  Does anyone
know if there are any differences in these ECUs?  Will it work in my bus.
Any advice would be appreciated.
