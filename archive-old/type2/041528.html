Smittie,

Remember that it's cooled by air!  Going over the Grapevine, plan on spending
a lot of time in third gear.  In my '77 if the speed drops to 50 in fourth, I
downshift and run at 45-50 til the road flattens out.  Nothing, absolutely
NOTHING, will kill an air-cooled engine faster than lugging the engine
crossing mountains.  High load/heat, low fan speed.  (As an aside, one of the
premier locales for dead VWs is Flagstaff, AZ.  From the east, the road looks
flat, but you're climbing all the time.  Folks run along at about 50 in fourth
with it floored for 20 miles.  Almost guaranteed to drop a valve seat.)
