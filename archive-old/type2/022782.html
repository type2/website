Having found (and bought) another A/C Vanagon sitting at a gas station I have
to get rid of the'78.

Regular van,117K, 2.0, very strong, 125-130 psi all cylinders, no oil leaks,
new clutch, plugs, installed spare cap/rotor, filters,changed trans oil.  Body
straight, really. Surface rust here and there, battery tray rusted out, some
other minor rust areas and pitting. Dent's on rear roof as some scum tried
using it as a step ladder to attempt a break-in where it was parked.  They
have been pushed out, but could use some attention. Good tires (1 new).  I
bought this van after it had been sitting for ~4 years and have been getting
it back into shape. I just found a regular vanagon and can't keep 3 at my
present address.  (I also have a '69 for fix up and drive or parts, (prefer
whole) for sale, located in SW Virgina---I would like to keep it's type 1
engine,
though)  The '78 is Biege over brown.  Write if interested in either van.  I
can deliver the van virtually anywhere on the east coast, we can make
arrangements otherwise.  The van has been very reliable, I have taken it on a
550 mi round trip into the mountains of Virginia, where it's performance
suprised me after driving the westy all this time.
