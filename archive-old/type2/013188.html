Hey Volks,

My friend Nick Palmer just blew a spark plug out of his engine block -- I'm
assuming the plug was mis-threaded and it finally just popped out.  

So, he's looking for tips on a mechanic/machine shop in the area where he
can get a heli-coil put in his head, and, if possible, a driveway where he
can pull his engine/head to take it to said shop.  Barring a friendly driveway,
a reputable VW mechanic to get towed to would suffice.

So, if anyone can help him out with any of the above information, he'd 
really appreciated it:  Nick Palmer, 916.837.5683  (cell phone)
Call him anytime as he's anxious for any info.

alternately, if you can't get through, contact me via email.

oh, as the subject line says, he's in Coachella, California and he's
driving a '77 Riviera:  2.0L, FI, Manual, Olive Green.

cheers,
        t
        hoping the above content is acceptable
