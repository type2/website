&gt; &gt; This is how VW designed them- to be run at high RPMs.

&gt; But, not under a high load.  The reason busses break is that their cooling 
&gt; systems are marginal and they overheat if you push too hard.

The stock cooling systems are quite robust.  I know this because I pass a
lot of &quot;modern&quot; cars that are pulled to the side of the road overheated.

Now, if you let the cooling system deteriorate, it can certainly become
marginal.  Every bus that I've seen overheated had some combination of
missing rubber seals, missing tin, missing heater hoses, or other
non-stock condition that reduced the engine's ability to cool itself.

&gt; I think you do 
&gt; new owners a disservice by suggesting that it's OK to drive a bus at over 70 
&gt; MPH for long periods of time with no adverse side effects.

I think that the &quot;top speed is cruising speed&quot; was mostly a creative way
to turn the vehicle's being underpowered into something positive.  It was
probably true of the 40HP buses, but as the engines got bigger it became
possible to rev them pretty fast in 4th.  I think that drivers were
probably a bit more sensitive to this in the '70s than they are now
because cars were less of a &quot;turn the key and go&quot; appliance as they are
now.
