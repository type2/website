Subject: [T2] AIRS Couple from FLA.

Any one else get a call from a young couple traveling up 85-95 from
Florida to Virginia this weekend? They called around 9:30 Saturday night
and left about 2:30 am Sunday morning from my house. Their generator
pulley had started to turn freely on them and they where about to loose
their only fan belt. I didn't have a &quot;correct&quot; pulley but the one we put
on might have worked for the drive ahead of them. The Guys name was
Chad, forgot the young girls name. This is a couple that David at Bug
Junction had also helped.

I hope they will make it all he way, but I doubt it, if you have any
info on them making it to their destination please let us know, we would
feel better for them knowing they are safe and off the road.


Meredith and Debbie
