Mike Dwyer sends:

&gt; My 74 Westy just had a bad engine.  $500.00.  Northern California.  I've got
&gt; to ask, What is &quot;the usual rust&quot; many of you folks mention?  :&gt;)

Spread out the fingers on one hand. Put the tip of your thumb on the very
bottom edge of the Bus and the tip of your pinkie as high up as it will go
without any unnatural stretching. Anything in there is &quot;the usual rust&quot; on
the bottom, because of the way the metal is. Then go to the windows...
usually the first two inches below the windshield and the entire
window-hole-edge area will be rusty in a Bus.

On a Riviera (does a Westy have a wooden floor?) removing the plywood floor
in the passenger area will reward the owner with a whole lot of rust. This
is where I'm at right now; do they sell Naval Jelly in 55-gallon drums?
