&gt; list,
&gt; what is the best product to use when glueing the valve cover gaskets to
&gt; valve covers.

I dont use any type of glue. That just makes it harder to clean up the
surfaces when it comes time for new gaskets. I smear a very thin layer of
your every day wheel bearing grease on both sides of the gasket. Helps them
stick and wont harm the internals of the valve assembly. You dont have to
use alot, just enough to help them stick.
