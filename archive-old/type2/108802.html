&gt; I 'think' it's gone...I saved the link (and posted it occasionally to
other lists for fun and entertainment value), but it doesn't 'work'
anymore...

Has anyone had success in pasting the link into a search engine to see if
one of the search engine sites has the old page still in the engine's cache?
Just a thought...
