Subject: Muir Publications Address

I gave away my Muir book with the last bus I sold, but now I find myself in need of contact information for Muir Publications.

I think the address is in the back of the book. Could someone please forward it to me. A phone number and name of a person would be even more helpful. I'm trying to get reprint permission on something.

Thanks! Joe
