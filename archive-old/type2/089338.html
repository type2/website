Subject: Re: [T2] timing question

[...]
is timing advancing when you increase speed?  Are you setting timing 
with vacuum attached?  by no power, do you mean at  full throttle or at 
lower rpms in 3rd gear?

&gt; Hi Jim,
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for the info... I was hoping that the dizzy was just completely
&gt; wrong, but apparently it is fine.  What is a hood stamp?  The label on 
&gt; the
&gt; engine compartment lid?
&gt;
&gt; Still, if I time at 5ATDC, the bus runs like crap... no power.  I am
&gt; perplexed.
