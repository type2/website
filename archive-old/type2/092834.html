Subject: Re: [T2] Bracket for a/c compressor

You gotta find out if the compressor is cracked, the fan shroud it is 
bolted to is broke or if the steel mount is broken.

You can replace any one part of the system and they can Heli-arc or TIG 
weld any broken aluminum parts if you have the missing part (or you might 
find somebody that can &quot;recreate&quot; the missing piece and weld it on).

You may have the last working aircooled a/c system in the US! &lt;grin&gt;

Be sure all of the engine tin is there and the oil cooler is clean as is 
the fins on the pistons and cylinders. I'd hate to hear that you burned it 
up with the a/c on.

&gt;Hi everyone- as it gets hotter and hotter hear in NJ I am sooo wishing
&gt;that I had fixed the a/c in my bus when it broke last year!  It was
&gt;working fine, VERY nice and cold (at least on me, the driver, where it
&gt;was important!) when the belt broke.  Apparently there are some brackets
&gt;on the outside of the compressor that hold the belt in place and one of
&gt;these is broken so the belt keeps breaking or popping off. (This is the
&gt;second time the belt went)  The compressor itself is ok, but does anyone
&gt;know if it is possible to just get the housing for the compressor with
&gt;good brakets or do I just shell out the $$ for a new compressor?  I
&gt;know, I should just tough it out without a/c but I sweat like a pig and
&gt;my kids are screaming in the backseat, blah, blah, blah.....Thanks for
&gt;any info!  Love, Beth and Prudence the 78 Bus

Ciao!
