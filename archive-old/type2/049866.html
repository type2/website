Hello List!!

I can't contain myself, I have to brag about my latest find.  

I bought a '68 7-seater for $300.  It has 2 dual port engines; the one in it 
runs but oil gushes from the oil cooler; no matter, I got it as a parts bus.  
It came with a second dual port engine, the PO claims it has a leaking rear 
(front) main seal.  Inside, it's been partially stripped in preparation for a 
restoration, and most of the parts are there.  There was a footlocker full of 
parts inside.  I found some interesting stuff, like all 4 round reflectors in 
good shape, a spare '68 door handle (something I REALLY wanted), and the rear 
bumper splash guards in good shape (also something I was looking for).  I'll 
have to wait for more time and warmer weather to really pull everything out 
and &quot;inventory,&quot; but I think I made out like a bandit on this one!  I plan to 
use the nose to replace mine and some other body panels to take care of 
cancer on mine.  Can't gut mine for the &quot;new&quot; one as it has special 
sentimental value (father-in-law bought it new, wife grew up in it...).  When 
I'm done with it (won't be a while...) I'll offer any parts I don't want to 
the list first.
