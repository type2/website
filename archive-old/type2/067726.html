Subject: suspension rattles and klunks

The '82 GL I recently bought is a lot noisier than my '84 (grit your teeth) 
waterboxer which is an automatic. The engine which has an aftermarket 
&quot;bugpack&quot; exhaust connected to the heat exchangers. I think it's mainly the 
exhaust makes this engine a lot noisier than mye '84's. The manual transmission 
is also a lot noisier. Could the '84 have a lot more undercoating and 
soundproofing as compared to the '82. Aside from the differences in the 
powertrains are the older vans inherently noisier? I suspect this is the case.  
Don't get me wrong, I like the '82 it's a lot more fun to drive and a lot peppier 
than the '84. The noises that bothers me most in the '82 though come from the 
loose suspension things that rattle and go klunk when I drive over rough roads 
and (slowly) over speed bumps. My '84s suspension is quite tight and I'd like to 
make the '82 the same!

Here are my top suspects:

Front:
                Stabilizer link bushings: Loose.. can these be bought and replaced?
                Shocks: I need to replace these anyway... inexpensive suggestions?
                Lower control arm bushings: Uppers look OK.. I'm getting a lot of noise!

Rear:
                Engine mounts: Look soft and a bit saggy. (not looking forward to doing these!)
                Shocks: Same as the front!
                Trailing arm arm bushings: Do these go bad?

I plan to attack the stabilizer bushings first and then the shocks. Any 
insight you might provide me with on quieting and tightening this baby up 
will be greatly appreciated. 

PS:     I dont know how many miles are on the vehicle cause the odometer was 
                                incapacitated when I bought the vehicle. 

Shakin all over.....
