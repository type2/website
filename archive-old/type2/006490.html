I am picking up this 70 westy  that has a weird setup. It is a front bench
and in the camper area, up against the bench wall is a cabnet, sink , gas
stove, and a 12V fridge all in one fail swoop. The top flips up and lays
over the front seats to make a bar and reviel the sink and stove. Has anyone
heard of this before?
I am keeping the bed and selling the van whole . it runs and I only want
$500 obo.
 It has accident damage to the front passenger side but looks as if it could
be pulled.
