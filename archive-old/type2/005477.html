 Subject: [T2] Oil Cooler washers - 2.0 Liter

&gt;When installing the oil cooler on a 2.0 liter engine, where do the
&gt;'thickish' washers go? Under the nuts ... or between the cooler and the
&gt;crankcase?

Only the seals go between the cooler and the mounting surface.
There were originally two washers for each mounting nut, the thick
one you mentioned and a thin one then the nut, and i prefer to use
 a nylock there, to prevent loosening.
