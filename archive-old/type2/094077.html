Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Filter Change - cutoff valve

I like Impco.  

I plan to convert my bus to to a SLEV (super low emission vehicle) running
on God's Gas at the next rebuild.  Impco has many of the needed parts
available.  I also want to figure out a way to make an air conditioner work
using the fuel as the refrigerant.

&gt; I would like to post a BIG thank you to who ever posted the cutoff valve
&gt; link to IMPCO.
&gt; 
&gt; At $26 it is the perfect line lock for the gas line. Be aware that they
&gt; have one rated for gasoline and one for propane. Excellent fire protection
&gt; AND theft protection!
&gt; 
&gt; The main site has their catalog for download on .pdf format. Great for
&gt; those of us who collect info for later.
