Subject: '71 hardtop camper free to good home.

Hey all,

I got a message from my landlord stating that I need to be rid of my '71
bus. It's located in Santa Clara, CA (San Jose, south bay area). It's
in decent shape, the body has a bit of rust, but not too much, the
cabinets are pretty decent. The engine runs but could probably use some 
tightening up. I wouldn't recommend trying to drive it from here unless 
you're REAL close (within a few blocks). I'm offering it up free to a good
home. It has a clear title. It's gotta be moved by this weekend, or else
I'll have to have it towed to the wreckers (which I don't want to do).
Email me _at_ duelist_at_bigtiger_dot_net if you're interested.


-Marc
