        Steve has some really good points here, but I feel I should throw in
my 2 cents. :)
Steve says &quot;hold 2nd gear to 27-30&quot;.  I agree with 27, definitely NOT 
30, though.  Then, he says to &quot;hold 3rd gear to 45-47&quot;.  I really disagree
with this point. eP  I hold 3rd to 42 at the MAX!!  I think my engine would 
blow at anything past 42(in 3rd).
Lastly, he highly advises against ~30 or ~50 for any prolonged time.
I have to disagree here.  I cruise around all the time at 30/32 in 3rd.
This engine has over 200K.....

&gt; &gt; What really gets me is that the harder the motor works, the cooler it gets. I
&gt; &gt; assume that's a function of higher air flow at higher rpms. On the other
&gt; &gt; hand, the worst situation is simply loafing down the road. It actually runs
&gt; &gt; cooler on a hilly road than on a nice flat one apparently since the motor has
&gt; &gt; to work now and again What kind of through the looking glass scenario is
&gt; &gt; that?
&gt; 
&gt; Remember that your cooling system is bolted to the end of your crankshaft.
&gt; The greater the RPM's the greater the cooling. It runs cooler on hills for
&gt; two reasons:  First, as you go downhill, you let up on the gas, but keep
&gt; the clutch in so the RPM's stay up, pumping more air over an engine that
&gt; is burning less gas (and generating less heat as a result).  Second, you
&gt; *may* be downshifting on the uphills raising the RPM's and pumping more
&gt; air even though, with the pedal to the metal, you are generating more
&gt; heat.  On level ground you may be doing 50-55 in 4th with the pedal down
&gt; and the RPM's down too.
&gt; 
&gt; Last year I spent 8000 miles on the road driving from here (DC) to Seattle
&gt; to LA and back with a pair of VW virgins.  I spent the first 3000 miles
&gt; (to Seattle) banging on their heads every time they tried to mountain
&gt; climb in 4th at 50 mph.  After that, I took over the driving 'til we got
&gt; back to the &quot;flat states&quot; (NM, TX.....).
&gt; 
&gt; VW's *need* high RPM's to pump cooling air.  They run coolest at the top
&gt; of the RPM range.  Downshifting a Ford is a good idea in the mountains.
&gt; Downshifting a VW is *vital* in the mountains.  If your RPM's are too low
&gt; even on flat ground (45-55 mph in 4th around town) your engine *will* heat
&gt; up.  The solution is (for 'loafers) to hold second 'til 27-30, third 'til
&gt; 45-47 and try not to do either ~30 or ~50 in any gear range for extended
&gt; periods.  Splits (different gearing) may vary (and I am learning {slowly}
&gt; to keep my mouth shut during &quot;split&quot; post sessions ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; My mountain driving drill is to start at ~65-70.  As you start climbing,
&gt; if the speed starts to drop, back off to 3/4 throttle and let it.  When
&gt; the speed drops to ~55-57,  clutch pedal goes in and shift to third.  As
&gt; it drops past 47, out comes the clutch and try 3rd.  Do the same if you
&gt; drop to 35 (only once on that trip).
