Oh no the FART has returned. 

&gt; I want to replace the rear tires on my new '71 westy. the tread is pretty
&gt; thin, and there are some potentially bad cracks in the sidewalls. Anyone
&gt; have recommendations for what to get? I know that i shuld look for
&gt; light-duty truck tires, but i'm wondering there's a preferred brand/model
&gt; of tire i should look at. Since i don't have a lot of time, i was hoping to
&gt; just go to one of the big tire places, like Goodyear or Sears.

I really like my Michilen MXT tires I got from NTB (National Tire and
Battery) I got 205/70R 14 tires.  these are about as wide as it's possible
to get into a bus wheelwell and not rub.  the catch, these puppies are not
cheap, about $100 per tire.
