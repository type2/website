Subject: Re: Sunroof drain question

I got plastic clear tubes over those drains.. then installed copper
pipe on the deck in the engine bay.. the tubes run from the drains to
these short copper pipe assemblies and allow the water to drain
straight through to the ground... While water does go in there when you
are driving
installing the tubes/drains prevents water from just dripping and
sitting
in the engine bay from sunroof drain.
A while ago I gave up on fixing and refixing the slider and did this...

not for everyone but it works great for me.. Gives head room when
camping...

&gt; Subject: Sunroof drain question

&gt; 
&gt; I'm thinking of trying to finesse some plastic tubing onto the ends
&gt; of 
&gt; the drain tubes in hopes of routing the water out through the body 
&gt; drains.  Does anyone know how VW did it?  Any clever-er solutions?
