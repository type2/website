Hi All,

I tried to back my '78 up a steep hill and it wouldn't go.  As I gave it
gas and let the clutch out it felt kind of like the clutch was slipping, only
I guess it wasn't since the engine slowed and stalled after a foot or so
of movement.  It felt like something in the transmission  was slipping which
doesn't make sense since it is a manual transmission, and the bus didn't
move much before stalling.  Its hard to explain, but it felt like the energy
from the engine was making it through the clutch but somehow not reaching
the wheels.  I tried a few times before giving up.

I was able to turn around and go up the same steep hill forwards with no
problems at all.  I can back up on level surfaces fine, it was only on this
steep hill where I had the problem.

Is this the transmission or the clutch or? Someone told me that it could
be something in the rear brakes.  Something to do with which brake shoe
is 'leading' when you are going in a certain direction.

Any help would be greatly appreciated..

thanks!
