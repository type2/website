Subject: Re: [T2] Fitting a 34PICT3 on a 1600DP With alternator

Hello Jules  there are a couple of ways to fix this the bugs from 73-74 had 
the linkage that would work with out grinding or bending anything.  the other 
way is to  grind the screw down and bend the lever down then grind a little off 
the alt. caseing , If you dont want to grind anything then get the correct 
linkage from a 73-74 bug . I might have some of these but it would require 
digging thur a shelf of about 100 carbs,   later and have fun  Mark Dearing   Salem
