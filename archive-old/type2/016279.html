Subject: 74 Bay-window remodel (kind of long)

Hello list,

I have asked two questions during the time I have subscribed to this list:
1.  installing a sun roof, and
2.  removing the bulkheads behind the front seats.
I have received many responses, and I thank you for them. However, I think I
should be more forthcoming regarding the context within which I am asking my
questions. So, a short history of my bus and me.

This is my second bus. (The first was a '68, purchased in '70 when my kids were
young. I loved that bus and have often regretted selling it.) In 1993 I bought
the '74 (in Phoenix) for $500. The body was rust and dent free, but the engine
needed work and the interior appointments consisted of front seats only. The PO
was a high school lad and the PPO was a pizza parlor. The bus had been used for
delivering pizzas. More than that I do not know.

I was trying to finish college (Arizona State University) and there was precious
little money for the bus. I did have the engine rebuilt and the other mechanical
systems inspected and repaired, but the aesthetics had to wait. So, six years
later here I am in Chicago, still in school but now with a little money
available to spend on the bus, which I have decided to keep; if not personally,
at least in the family. Both of my boys have expressed a strong desire to own it
if I ever choose to sell it.

After three winters here in the great, salty Mid-West, there is more rust on the
bus than in 20 years in Phoenix. A condition that I do not appreciate! So, last
Thursday the bus went under the wrench, so to speak. If things go according to
plan she will spend most of her fourth Mid-West winter in various shops being
treated with TLC.

I know, for some of you sending your bus from shop to shop is as close to
blaspheme as a person can get without going straight to hell. Sorry, but I do
not do my own mechanical work. You see every time I try, even the simplest job
seems to take a week and ends up costing me $500, or more. So, I have learned to
trust in the expertise of professionals.

Anyway, my bus improvement plans are:
1.  have all mechanical systems returned to excellent operating condition,
2.  do something to turbo charge the heating system (a thread I have read with
great interest)
3.  replace all body seals and rubber,
4.  seal and paint the body (she still has her original paint), and
5.  customize the interior.

It is for item number 5 that I have asked the questions mentioned above. It
seems to me that having a sunroof would be nice. I also think I should not be
limited to basic bus front seats. Why not have the option to ride in the same
comfort that some of my friends have when they slide into their Q-45s? Thus the
question about removing the bulkheads in anticipation of reclining front bucket
seats. BTW, part of the anticipated interior improvements are two (maybe four)
nice bucket seats fitted into the presently seatless passenger compartment.

So there you are. The framework for my questions and my plans for the bus. As
always, I am open to your thoughts and comments. I have no desire to re-invent
any perfectly good wheels, nor do I feel the need to invent any bad ones.

Best regards,
Bob
