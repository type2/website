Subject: RE: [T2] Bus Depot

Yes.  Don't order anything online. They list lots of items. However, in
almost every case when I have placed an order a Bus Depot employee calls to
tell me half the item is out of stock.  I have had several items on
back-order for months.  I have had much better luck with Bus Boys (they got
a rebuilt '68 bus steering bos to my mechanic in one day - they are in
Calif.  we are in Maryland).  Rocky Mountain is also very prompt.
