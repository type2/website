Chip,
Try closing off the tailpipe with your shoe while the engine is running. If your
exhaust is tight, you'll be able to kill the engine. You might try having
someone in the cab while doing this with the heaters on. Maybe they'll be able
to detect an increase in fumes.

&gt;I have a new engine seal and decklid seal. Is there anyway to
&gt;test the heat exchangers to see if it is they that are the culprits?
