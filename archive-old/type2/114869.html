Subject: Charcoal Filter Canister cleaning or replacement?

I am in the process of replacing my fuel tank evaporation lines in my 73
Westy, well not the lines, but all the rubber connectors between the lines.
This entire system leads back into the charcoal filter in the engine
compartment. I assume that this filter has not been changed since new in 73.
Does anybody on the list know how to clean this or replace the filter? Is
this even possible? A new one cost $50 bucks from Bus Depot. Currently I
have a some fresh fuel smells when I fill up, so I want to eliminate the
smell as much as possible. How well would a new one really work? 

Anther question, The fuel lines leave the tank and go up into the fresh air
vents on the sides of the bus, what type of vent system are the cylinders
here supposed to be? I have the small cylinders, but they are covered with
paint from when the PO got it painted. Not that I could ever get in there to
change them, but I curious as to what they are exactly.

Thanks,
Corbett
