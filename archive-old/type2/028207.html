Hi Folks,

I've been struggling with excessively high oil temps recently, and have been 
thinking about replacing my oil cooler.  I have a 1979 2.0L GE-series FI 
engine, and live at 8,000ft elevation.  The current oil cooler is original, 
and is probably not working very efficiently anymore (clogged with oil 
inside, clogged with dirt outside).  I'm also considering adding an external 
cooler as well...

So, does anybody know if the stock oil cooler can be replaced with the 
engine still in the Bus?

Thanks for any help,
Jason Upper
