&gt;  I hate to say this but you are SO wrong!  Take the following scenario as
&gt;  justification for my opinion - you are driving down the road and
&gt;  unbeknownst to you a plastic bag gets sucked into your side scoop and 
&gt;into
&gt;  your engine fan.  The driver with gauges notices that his CHT and oil 
&gt;temp
&gt;  are suddenly going up very fast, pulls over and removes the bag.  The
&gt;  driver with no gauges motors happily along until his engine overheats and
&gt;  locks up.


Another Scenerio:

You're driving on a gravel road.  Because you can't hear the engine, you 
forget to shift from 3rd to 4th, so you're driving along at 50 mph in 3rd 
gear, until your engine overheats.  If you had a temperature gage, you would 
have noticed the temperature and figured out the problem.
