EXACTLY! The retard is purely an emmisions device. So, the 5 ATDC setting is
still required, unless you like replacing pistons.

&gt; So, in theory, one can set the dual vac to 5 ATDC with both hoses hooked
&gt; up, disconnect the retard hose, and run the distributor at that setting.
&gt; (i am learning here, any and all help/ideas appreciated.)
