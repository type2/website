&gt; A few years ago the 009 and the 34PICT3 were supposedly hot items.  Probably 

which never even considered the late Fuel Injected versions

&gt; it's still with us today despite all kinds of &quot;fix-ups&quot;.  In the intervening 
&gt; years a lot of folks have come to realize that the best way of handling the 
&gt; problem is to ditch the 009 in favor of a dual advance dizzy.
&gt; 
&gt; And that realization is simply based on the fact that the 009 is, at heart, a 
&gt; piece of racing equipment.  If we were to drive our cars at full throttle all 
&gt; the time the 009 would be OK for the street.  But we don't and it isn't.  For 
&gt; daily driving we need a dizzy with a dual advance to get us through the low 
&gt; end of the acceleration curve.

and no where is this more apparent than in stop and go driving, I live
&quot;Downtown&quot; in a major metro area.  a very large part of my driving is done
in stop and go traffic.  my 78 came with a 009 dizzy, I never felt like I
was going to get moving, merging into traffic was a nightmare and I caught
every traffic light even though they were supposed to be &quot;timed lights&quot;.
  put the spec dizzy in there and the darn thing can keep up with traffic.

if you do all interstate driving you might not notice much difference, but
get the Bus &quot;Downtown&quot; and believe you me you will assuradly &quot;NOTICE&quot; the
difference.
