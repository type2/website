&gt; A coupla questions for you smart folk!
&gt; 
&gt; 1)  What is this wierd little spring loaded doohickey center under my
&gt; dash?  
&gt; http://www.skanky_dot_org/bus/wonder/MVC-111F.JPG
&gt; Just wondering...

Well, it looks like a door jamb switch, but I've no idea what it would be
doing there.  What happens when you press it?

&gt; 2)  My new hazard switch has one more terminal than the old...  Pics of
&gt; old and new here:
&gt; 
&gt; http://www.skanky_dot_org/bus/wonder/hazard.jpg
&gt; 
&gt; The old switch has a resistor that Haynes sez: &quot;resistance which dims
&gt; the fascia warning light when the main lights are switched on.  When the
&gt; emergency signal is operated the warning light is bright.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; So, no resistor, and nothing to attach to that lug.  Consequences?  No
&gt; glow on the switch?

Hmm, hard to say.  Did you get the right switch?  I can't read the
terminal numbers on the bottom picture well, but it looks like the extra
pin is labeled &quot;54&quot;.  I don't see this one on any diagram I have.

AS far as I'm concerned, the only function of the emergency flasher switch
is to supply power to the turn signal flasher.  If it does that I count
myself lucky!

&gt; 3)  I found a little spring, slightly smaller than a std ballpoint pen
&gt; spring on the floor today after wrassling with this stuff.  Uh, could
&gt; this be important?  I've tried very hard not to be bruteful, and as far
&gt; as I can tell have not knocked anything else loose, but...

You'll have to wait and see.  It's amazing what will turn up in a new to
you vehicle.
