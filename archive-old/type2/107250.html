Subject: Canadian Tires / michelin X ? ??

Hello,

While on honeymoon last summer, I had to buy a new spare. the place only had 
one tire (Very small place) that would fit my needs, a 'Michelin X' 185/75 
R14 C XC M+S4. Apparently, Michelin made them from 1988 to 1999, then 
stopped production. These were sold exclusively in Canada apparently.

Well, I want another to match it. I have to make the drive from San 
Francisco to Minneapolis MN come mid October, and the aggressive tred 
pattern makes me feel a little safer/in control. Plus, they look really 
cool. =)

Anyway, any thoughts on where I might be able to track one of these down? Or 
am I forever stuck with an oddball tire?
