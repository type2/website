Subject: RE: '75-78 One-Piece Exhaust

&gt;&gt; This is a one-piece replacement for the  '75-78 Bus exhaust
&gt;&gt; system. Looks like the stock muffler, but with integrated tailpipe
&gt;&gt; and with simple tubes going to the heat exchangers instead
&gt;&gt; of the crossover pipe setup.  A bit more nicely put together
&gt;&gt; now that they're making it themselves in the U.S. rather than in
&gt;&gt; Mexico. My part number is 352000 and the price is $99.95.


&gt; Ron, is Pacesetter making the BODY of the muffler in the USA??
&gt; A while back, when I talked with S&amp;S Headers about their one
&gt; piece muffler for my '78, S&amp;S said that they imported the muffler
&gt; body, but made and connected their own 'pipes'.


I passed your question on to Pacesetter, who replied that the entire thing
is U.S. made.
