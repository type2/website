Subject: auxiliary blower

    I have one in my '71. I used the three-speed switch that came with
it. It seems to me that the defroster switch could handle the current
involved but you might want the three-speed switch anyway as that thing
is pretty loud at high speed. Mounting it to the rear of the tube might
help the noise.
    The aluminum tape that came with the blower sure was pretty but
there didn't seem to be enough of it for what they had in mind so I used
duct tape (hey, it's a duct, right?). In retrospect I could have also
bought more aluminum tape; they sell it in the exhaust section of any
FLAPS. I peeled back the fiberglass wrap as carefully as possible, cut
what tube needed cutting , taped the blower in place and then wrapped
that thing up but good. Replaced what insulation I could, duct taped
some more, ran one wire to a good ground on the frame and the other to
the dash and painted it all flat black. It goes. The noise doesn't
bother me as I use it mostly to clear everything up as quickly as
possible when warming the beast. In the dead of winter (which still
isn't that bad in Seattle) I may leave it on low to try to help the
drafty cabin.
    Overall; it was worth the $70 or so it cost and the afternoon it
took to install. It will be of even greater benefit, however, if you
also take the trouble to do your door seals, window seals, secure and
seal your heater boxes, etc. Like other places in the Veedub, the system
can be improved on but the first step is to make sure it's working as it
was designed to.
