Volks,
Turns out the 74 I bought for $800 is really a 73...started it up on the
third try after it sat for 6 months!!!  Rust free except around the battery
box, and complete interior.......No major restoration here!!

I am pulling the engine today and Saturday..........seems to have good oil
pressure, but weak compression.so am considering advice from a listee to
replace the heads and the P&amp; C and count my blessings.  I want to do all the
work on this car myself..to minimize costs and for glory purposes!

Any advice on what route to go here....I want reliable transportation...I
want to be able to hop in and go across the country in this car.  Thus, I
want to ensure the motor is solid.........Any combo info and your results
would be appreciated.
