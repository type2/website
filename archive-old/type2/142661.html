Subject: Re: [T2] smaller voltage regulator

Regarding that smaller style Bosch VR I posted about yesterday...

I put it on the engine last night and ran through my battery of tests (pun). It seems to work a lot better than any of the mechanical or taller style voltage regulators.

Engine off: 12.65V (before installing VR)
Engine on: 14.00V
Engine on, lights on (13.94V)

I've never been able to hold the charging voltage with the headlights on before. It's really getting the most out of the alternator changing nothing else except for the VR that's 3 years old. Even while revving the engine the circuitry in this VR seems far more responsive.

Engine off tests next moring:

Intial reading: 12.75V
Key on: 12.51V
Key on, lights on: 12.12V

15 minutes later... (to remove any surface charge)

Key off, lights off: 12.09V
Key off, 5 more minutes later: 12.53V

The battery is in a better state of charge than I've ever seen it.

Here's a photo of the newer style VR beside the older ones:

&gt;I knew the part number (0 192 062 007) was different that the usual ones:
&gt;
&gt;55A 0 190 600 016
&gt;70A 0 190 600 006

I got the part number for the old style 70A version wrong. It should be 0 190 601 006.
