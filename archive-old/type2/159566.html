Bob,

is it the correct size rubber? the few windows I have installed all fit
quite snug on the glass so that movement was about impossible. I did 
have a gasket that came in from a vendor that was incorrect and it did 
the same thing yours did because it was the incorrect gasket.


&gt; I swear I don't remember it being this hard before...

hehe. &quot;that's what she said&quot; (sorry how often do you actually get to 
type that ;)
