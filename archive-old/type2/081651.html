Subject: Re: [T2] partial brake job?

&gt;&gt;replacing just the master cylinder, adjusting the
brakes and bleeding, without doing any other brake
work?&lt;&lt;

i did this on an '87 Prelude i had a while back &amp; had no problems, so i'm
sure it can be done.  but you have all drum brakes, correct?  i guess the
only drawback would be that you couldn't fully inspect the inside of the
drums &amp; condition of the shoes, etc.

but yes it could be done.
