Subject: OTHER WHEEL CHOICES

All this talk about wheels inspired me to shop the &quot;mainstream&quot; (although if 
you are buying custom wheels, they might as well be bigger right?). I sent 
in the question below to tires dot com and they sent me back the response 
you see. i doubt that 17inch wheels with 7 inches of tread width would 
actually fit on a bay window, so i queried them again and haven't yet heard 
back. does anyone know of any other custom wheel choices that fit our 
hassle-laden bolt pattern and look &quot;cool?&quot; my local import vw shop 
(autosport, vancouver wa) said they had a choice from Rocket Wheels, but 
&quot;lost the faxed copy&quot; and said they'd look for it. anyway, follow the link 
and see how COOL our busses might be...

&gt;I would like to know what custom 15 inch and 16 inch wheels you carry that
&gt;would fit on a 1977 vw transporter. on the website, the only vw options
&gt;shown for 1977 were vw beetle and vw scirocco. do you know what would fit a
&gt;1977 transporter. i am interested in wheel/tire packages.
&gt;thank you
