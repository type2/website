It's a brand new carb, I would guess the wear is nil or minimal.  I haven't
checked the manifold nuts in a long time, but now I will.  This is
interesting:  I have a motor that shouldn't be running well.  I'm going to
poke around a little and find out what's up.

Without trying too hard to fix something that ain't broke.  Don't want to
temp the gods.

&gt;
&gt;How loose is the throttle shaft? Push it back and forth. If it moves a
&gt;little, it's too much wear, as it will leak excess air around the baffle
&gt;and lean out the idle ergo no idle.
&gt;
&gt;If the shaft is tight in it's races, it could be a vaccumm leak down line
&gt;in which case search the archive for &quot;Vakuum Schlucks&quot; in the subject. How
&gt;tight are the manufold nuts?
