Subject: Handicapped Type 2 set up?

I've lost the use of my right leg for at least three months and maybe  
a year.  Do you know of anyone who has converted their type 2 to a  
handicapped driver vehicle?

It would probably be easier for me to do this to a toyota or  
something, but the seats are so low in them that I will not be able  
to get out of the car.

-Gary
