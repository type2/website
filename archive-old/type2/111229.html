&gt;&gt; I know that 78 child's cots were collapsible some how but I figured all of the
&gt; cots would be the same size.  So how many different size child's cots were
&gt; there for bay window buses?  And where am I gonna find the right size?
&gt; 
&gt;What part does not fit?
&gt;All the bay cot canvas is the same size.  But they do shrink.....
&gt;The bars are different lengths:
&gt;68-73 are 56 1/4&quot; long.
&gt;74-75 are 57 1/4&quot; long.
&gt;76-79 are two piece collapsible, but the 74-75 will fit.... you just won't have a place to store them.
&gt;The half moons are mounted higher up on the A and B pillars on 68-73 buses.
