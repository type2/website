Hi Barry,

I've noticed improvement in speed and reduction in engine load when drafting 
trucks, but I've been pretty close.  I find there's a &quot;sweet spot&quot; that's 
about 1.5 - 2 Bus lengths behind a truck -- any closer and it's (even more) 
dangerous, any farther and there's bad buffeting.  When convoys of trucks go 
by you, check to see how closely they're following each other.  It's 
surprisingly close (for 80,000lbs of steel moving at 70mph), but those guys 
are professionals.

I've found that drafting can work well for helping fuel economy.  My problem 
is maintaining a draft: finding a good lead vehicle that's going the same 
speed as you is tough, especially in a Bus.  If you add hills, low engine 
power, and high air temperature to the equation, it's difficult to get much 
useful drafting done.  However, one night I drafted a truck for about 1.5 
hours while going across Kansas -- he and I were going pretty much the same 
speed, and my fuel mileage improved a few points.

Here's another trick for the drafting aficionado: when a truck sweeps past 
you, let the bow wave push you away (towards the breakdown lane) as his nose 
comes even with yours, then squeeze over towards the truck as he goes by.  
There's a narrow channel of smooth air right next to the truck, and you can 
use it to cut down the drag on your Bus.  If the conditions are right, you 
can almost feel your speed increase as the truck sweeps past you.  Then, if 
there's space behind the truck, you can pull out into the drafting sweet 
spot as the truck goes by and gain a few MPH for a mile or two.  I've used 
that trick to &quot;slingshot&quot; my Bus past slower traffic as I come up on it.

As always, YMMV.  Be safe and have fun!
