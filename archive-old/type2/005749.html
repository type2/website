&gt; Gentlepersons-
&gt;                        I've got the chance to pick up Lindsay Porter's &quot;VW
&gt; Beetle &amp; Transporter
&gt; Guide to Purchase &amp; DIY Restoration&quot; - Sight unseen, but cheap. Anyone
&gt; familiar with the
&gt; book

Bussers,
I am of the opinion that you can't have too much information.  I have
Bentley, Haynes, Muir, Porter, Wilson, Russek, and even an old Clymer I got
at a swapmeet.  Porter has some specific Bus info but it's about  2/3 Type 1
specific.  Lots of useful tables and info though.  If you are rebuilding a
bus, you'll be glad to have the book.
