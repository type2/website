Right Isaiah!

Also - does the 16 year old kid know when he's being setup or taken 
advantage of?

I'm 30 years old and worked as Military Police for 3 years, was enlisted 
for 6 years and am now a Police dept. radio dispatcher. Maybe it's the jobs 
I've had but there are some BAD people out there. Some of these BAD people 
will do what they do for no reason at all. I know at age 16 I was in no way 
prepared to deal with this type of person.

My advice - do what you think is right. You know your kid. Is he going 
alone? It's alot more fun with a pal along for the ride (or you, his 
father) and alot safer too. Somebody to share the experience with.

At about 16 or 17 a friend and I went to the Smokey Mountains for 4 days 
with our bikes (we were really into touring then) on the back of his Eagle 
(remember those?) Great fun and only 3 hours from home. We ate good, slept 
good, and most of all had more fun than I thought possible at the time.

Yes we could have met up with the wrong people there like anywhere else but 
we were close to home and could get family help if we had mechanical 
troubles (in that Eagle - SURELY not... &lt;grin&gt;). All done in the age before 
cell phones...

Just work up to it - for the bus and for your son.

&gt;Being 17...I thought I'd comment on this since I'm probably one of the
&gt;youngest busers out there....
&gt;
&gt;If the person in question has just turned 16 or just got their license, I
&gt;think it would be a VERY bad idea to let them go out on a &quot;mega tour&quot;
&gt;(meaning driving cross country?)  especially in a bus....unless they really
&gt;know the bus inside and out.  I got my first car (71 bus - Stella) when I was
&gt;15 and worked on it a couple months before I got my license to get it running
&gt;and driving...and I knew that if I didn't, I wouldn't have a vehicle to
&gt;drive.  I did a lot of work on that old girl before she was ready to hit the
&gt;road....I got to know that bus very well.  I got the bus last year in the
&gt;beginning of june, and I got my license on July 30th last year....4 days
&gt;after my birthday.  I didn't take the bus out of town for a good 2 weeks,
&gt;just in case something were to happen.  I got on &quot;the list&quot; about a month or
&gt;two before I even got my bus, and read the manuals over and over.....and
&gt;asked a LOT of questions  (I'm sure many of you remember that).  Then, Buses
&gt;Nowhere Near the Arch came up, and I wanted to go....but my mother frowned
&gt;upon it...so I just went up into northern WI for a 4 day camping
&gt;excursion.....I was ticked at the time, but now I'm glad she did what she
&gt;did, because I don't think I was ready for the actual trip....the bus may
&gt;have been, but I don't think that I was.  I started attending DBG campouts,
&gt;and got to know a lot of other local busers....this helped a LOT.  I'd drive
&gt;up to 2-3 hours to go to a campout...and sometimes had VW events every week
&gt;or weekend.  I drove Stella as my daily driver up to about the beginning of
&gt;this summer and gave her a break (thats when I got my 62 bus)
&gt;Up until last spring, Stella had never been out of state....so on a spur of
&gt;the moment decision.... about 30 minutes before we left...I decided to drive
&gt;Stella to Detroit for the show last spring.  I'm glad I did this...and I
&gt;really didn't have any problems.  I had a wonderful trip too...not that far
&gt;away from home (oshkosh, wi) but far enough for my first trip.    Then came
&gt;buses nowhere near the arch this year, and I went... I had to.  I drove the
&gt;62 down and had no problems with the bus at all (except the fuel line coming
&gt;off at 5:30 in the morning on an Illinois interstate) and it was a BLAST.
&gt;Now if I wouldn't have been working on my own buses, I probably would not
&gt;know what to do, and would have had to call a tow truck or something of the
&gt;like.... so make sure that the teenager in question knows the bus inside and
&gt;out...becuase problems will arise....and mechanics and tow trucks get very
&gt;expensive, very fast.  The only time a real mechanic has ever touched any of
&gt;my buses....was to put a helicoil in the head..._dot_cause i didn't want to screw
&gt;it up.
&gt;
&gt;Has the teenager in question ever travelled before?  The world is a big
&gt;place....and can be scary too....  My grandfather is a truck driver, and I've
&gt;been riding with him since I was 7 or so...all over the country....so that
&gt;helped me a LOT I'm sure...  It can be a mental thing too....if the teen in
&gt;question is ready for the trip....  not insanity or anything like that...but
&gt;a mental state....if he's actually ready to go through with it.
&gt;
&gt;I loved to travel...and always have... but I'm glad I didn't take off cross
&gt;country the day I got my license... it DOES take practice to really know what
&gt;you're doing..  Thankfully, I haven't hit anyone/anything yet (knock
&gt;on...uhh... the metal dash... yeah..thats the ticket) and things have just
&gt;hit me... so my insurance hasn't gone through the roof...  make sure the
&gt;teenager in question knows what he/she is doing while driving...  Teen
&gt;insurance rates are outrageous...and theres a reason for it... and I'm paying
&gt;for it right now....just because of my age...even though I have a clean
&gt;record.
&gt;
&gt;Just my little insight...thought some of you might want to hear it from a
&gt;younger buser...  I mean...how many 17 year olds do you know that drive a bus
&gt;and are proud of it??  ;-)
&gt;
&gt;Isaiah
&gt;all air cooled, all the time
&gt;
&gt;ps....maybe I'm bragging a little... but I've to take advantage of being the
&gt;&quot;young one&quot; you know?  ;-)
