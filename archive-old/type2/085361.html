Subject: Gas tank pics


I took these pictures of my rusted out gastank:

http://homepage.mac_dot_com/ratwell/78_Westy/PhotoAlbum10.html

I've managed to get out most of the rust out with a chain rolling around
inside and some muratic acid and lots of hosing off.

In the other photos you can see that some of the black sludge that came out
is actually viscous and runs: I let it sit overnight.  I imagine if there is
any left it will just run down and block up the tubes at the bottom of the
tank.

What's left now is this sludge layer you can see at the bottom.  The acid
has turned the sludge yellowish from black but it's still hard to scrape.
I'd appreciate any advice on removing this.
