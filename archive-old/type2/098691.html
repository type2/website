Subject: Re: [T2] A few cleaner/degreaser/degooper questions.

Hello,

I have found Marine Clean to be a very good degreaser.
It is sold on www.por15_dot_com

 Lacaur thinner also works well to wipe away sticky
residue. Most of the time, I use a wire brush on my
drill to remove weather strip glue. This is the
fastest method I think.

Good Luck!
