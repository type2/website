Subject: [T2] petronix &amp; vdo tach

Hello Volks,

Is there anything special about installing a new VDO tach (333 051) if I
have a Petronix ignition system + .009 distributor?

In particular:
1) Do I connect to the negative connector on the ignition coil as I would
without the Petronix?

2) Do I set the dip switches differently from VDO's suggestion for using a
tach with an ignition coil:

#1 - On
#2 - Off
#3 - Off

Cheers,
Victor
