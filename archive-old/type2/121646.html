Subject: 34pict3 on a single port

&gt;Will a 34pict3 carb bolt right onto a single port intake manifold?  I want to
&gt;swap off the 30pict3 to see if that's my starting problem.

Negatory. You need one of those little adaptors to go from the smaller 
manifold to the larger carb base.

I used to have one to go from my dual port manifold to my 30-pict-3 carb. 
(Used it upside down.) It was a cheap form of cruise control. On the flat 
highway I had a brick that I would just push over on top of the accelerator 
and it would hold the speed steady at 58 mph.
