Subject: Felt Strip Replacement

	Does anyone know a good replacement for the felt strips which are between
the ribs on the cargo area under the carpet panel in a '71 transporter?
Also the OEM carpet in the cargo area above the engine seems to be a very
thin type glued to a masonite type board.  I can get 1/8 inch masonite
board and am wondering what type of carpet people have had success with.
Is the thin stuff available?  I also want to replace the rear cargo area
quarter panels with new masonite boards with the same carpet.

Thanks,
