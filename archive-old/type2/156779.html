Subject: Re: [T2] loose sterring / front end?

Three words, tires, tires, tires.  
  
 Loose steering can  be adjusted out to a point then you need a new steering box.  I  recently replaced mine and it made a world of difference.  Drag  links can be suspect.  And I had a bent tie rod.  If they're  not bent and the ends are tight, you're probably alright there.   And when you get it aligned, take Bentley with you and search the  archives for Richard Atwell's advice on the matter.  They probably  won't know the correct alignment procedure even if their machine has  the specs.  
  
 Mine holds the road quite nicely with new  Hancooks up front, fairly new Bridgestones on the back, new tie rods,  steering box, and alignment.  Also fairly new torsion bars in lieu  of new ball joints.  Good luck....KR

It wanders .....  So my question is where to start the rebuild / replace 
of what parts in the front end?  I have no idea how many miles are on 
the bus.  

It doesn't shimmy or shake, but the bus wanders around the lane.  Wind 
aggravates the issue and that is some what normal but moving out of your 
lane?

What steps would I need to take to diagnosis the issues?  
Recommendations please?
