My experience differs on an early VDO dipstick sender on type 1 engines.
Possibly it is different than the unit you tested.  I compared it to the
sump sender, a glass thermometer and my Fluke meter with an extremely
accurate temp probe and they were all within a couple degrees. The tiny
dipstick sender is at the very end of the dipstick and mine is unaffected by
case temperature. The case would cool the reading if anything, being cooler,
right?  Gee I gotta go measure my case now!

Neat idea on the oil cooler fan Jake!  I just modified the &quot;doghouse&quot; and
use a type 4 cooler.

The sump sender is the best. I have done back to back DYNO testing with both
types on the same engine, and had a 25 Degree fluctuation in readings. The
dipstick sender is heated by the case, as it slides into the dipstick tube.
In our test I used 2 used, and one brand new sender in the sump location and
3 new dipstick styles. They aere all the same.

I then placed the 2 in a pot of boiling water, to do the old fashioned test.
Unbelieveably the dipstick sender was within 5 degrees of the sump style
sender, until the edge of the sender made contact with the pot, which
changed the temp 30 degrees.

We make a sender for the sump area on our large engines that incorporates an
actuation switch for the oil cooler fan, we use a rabbit coolant sensor to
do the job, and place the oil temp sender  adjacent to it, it works great..
