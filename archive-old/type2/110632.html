&gt; &gt;Anybody got good scans of all the Westfalia stickers?
&gt; 
&gt; I bought my stickers from GoWesty about a year ago.

&gt; BTW, I really like this tiny URL service but I was thinking when it's down or go
ne, nobody searching the archives will be able to follow the links. Running a simi
lar service from type2_dot_com would be more helpful.

The real problem is that the tinyurl links won't work from archives. The
URLs are recycled quite frequently -- they're only 4 characters long.
If you go on vacation for a week the posted URLs may be already broken
by the time you return.

I use it all the time, but only for disposable purposes.
