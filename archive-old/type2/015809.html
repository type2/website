&gt;The recent FART thread regarding type I vs type IV engines raises a
&gt;recurring curiousity for me.  Various discussiuons in past months infer
&gt;that engine cases are not all created equal.  From campfire experiences I
&gt;know that the typical (German) type I engine case is cast of an aluminum
&gt;alloy that contains a significant percentage of magnesium.  I've also heard
&gt;talk of other engine cases (type IV and possibly the beetlemex type I)
&gt;being cast entirely of aluminum.  Now I know that magnesium is often used
&gt;to create lighter alloys.  Is there a knowledgeable type out there who can
&gt;explain the differences and relative advantages/disadvantages of aluminum
&gt;vs magnesium alloy engine cases???

I know that the all-aluminum type IV case does not &quot;fatigue&quot; like the
magnesium-alloy type I case.  So, the type IV case can be re-used almost
indefinately, as long as it's not damaged.  A type I case will eventually
&quot;wear out&quot;.  This is what I gathered from reading Tom Wilson's book.  I
think aluminum has a higher melting point as well, that knowledge also
gleaned from campfire experiences.
