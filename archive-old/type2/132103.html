Subject: Bay Area help - need flywheel shims

I've found myself in a bit of a jam and I'm looking for some local help.

I was planning to get my engine back in the bus this Saturday because next
Monday a new seal coating is going to applied to the parking lot where my
bus is located so I have to move the bus.

I was about to set the endplay on the engine tonight and I discovered that
one of the shims I got from Bus Boys was bad and with the shims I have left
I can't get the endplay within spec. It was borderline spec before.

In case I can't locate a shim locally tomorrow. Does anyone have a a pair of
021-105-287 0.36mm Type 4 shims they can spare? I should have &quot;planned
ahead&quot; about bought twice as many parts but I bought these shims over a year
ago before I got in that practice and didn't scrutinize them enough.
