Subject: Right rear side window installation (update)

David, Rosemary, everybody -- thanks for the suggestions! And a BIG thank
you to John Connolly at aircooled_dot_net for coming through with a rush
delivery on the POR-15!

I didn't do anything to the frame, except take the old window out! :-) The
sill was fine -- there was just a teensy-weensy bit of surface rust at the
seam at the top, which is why I wanted to do the POR-15. I prepped it and
coated it with White-Cote (I know it's kinda Step 1, Step 2, Step 4). I
also did the outside and hinge of the fuel flap, which looked like it used
to be on a desert bus in a few sandstorms (bare metal around the edges).

The White-Cote is kinda messy in a glue-y kinda way; latex gloves rule! It
looks great, it's curing now. The plan is I'm going take it to the pro on
Tuesday (after it cures), and if *they* can't make this seal work then I'm
returning it and getting one from Bus Depot.

If they *can* make the seal work, I'll go with my theory that when she got
thumped on that right rear corner back in the day, it distorted that window
opening just a tad.

Then we'll see what happens when I do the other side. Whee.

Nikki

&gt;        Last week you mentioned that you were needed Por15.  Did you fill the
&gt;holes with plastic filler?  If so, this causes a smaller opening. Have you
&gt;sanded the filler down?   I had to grind down my window to make it fit in
&gt;because I did my repair with metal.

&gt;&gt; I suggest you return the seal and get one from Bus
&gt;&gt; Depot.
