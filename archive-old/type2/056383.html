Subject: Like a Phoenix... '76 Camper!

I am proud to say that Leilani and I just crossed the country, California to
New Hampshire, in the '76 Camper. This is the bus that had been sitting
around in my garage for two years, already mechanically restored, awaiting a
complete exterior refinish. Nothing like a new job 3,000 miles away to get
me motivated.
In fact, the trip was its maiden voyage as I spent the last days before the
move scrambling to make it road-legal. 
How did it run?
With the exception of a minor but curious and frustrating hassle on I-5 in
Cal the '76 ran superbly. Through torrential rains and frighteningly high
winds the intrepid Leilani guided our bus while I towed the trailer behind
our Ford pickup. The bus was absolutely rock-steady reliable.  
Yow! It is beautiful, too! Turns alot of heads here in the Northeast. I am
singularly proud of this bus. Hmmm...&quot;this bus&quot; needs a name. 
Anyway, it is great to be back on the list and we are looking forward to
traveling to a show this season in Connnecticut or maybe Maine.

Oh, BTW, I am currently situated in Laconia, NH and am looking for a FLAPS.
Can anyone familiar with the area give me some advice? TIA.
