&gt;Here's a question - I snapped a rusty heater cable on my

&gt;thought I'd ask anyway.  Anybody know if I can use the '60 bug
&gt;cables for the heater controls on the '77 Westy (without cutting

I doubt it.  Not only do different year busses use different cables, but even
between left and right there is a difference.  It would be sheer coincidence
if they fit.  But you can find out if you have a RMMW catalog:  they give
the lengths for the different years and L or R sides.  You could look the
cables up for the '60 bug and the '77 bus and compare the lengths listed in
the catalog.  (I'd do it myself but I'm at work and the book's at home!)
