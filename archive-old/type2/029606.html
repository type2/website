Volks,

Yeah, I know... Friday's over, even here on the Moon :-)  That's OK, I am
really hoping that the other list admins get so upset they hold a coup and 
kick me out :-) (Please!  Please!!! :-)  Seriously, this is partly a
teaser for my next post, and partly a philosophical discourse on VW value.

*IF* you want a brand new VW bus, it is perfectly easy to go on down to
your local dealer and buy one.  They are called &quot;Eurovans&quot; and will set
you back $31,300 to $36,147 depending on options.  

If you want a brand new air cooled VW bus, well, that will be a bit
tougher :-(  They still make them in Brasil, and some countries allow you
to import them but the US does not.

If you want an air cooled bus that is as close to new as possible, then
you are talking a price somewhere between $0 and $36,147.  Where between
depends on luck, patience, and the amount that you are willing to invest
after purchase, both in time and money.  Now, that includes:

Case #1 The Deluxe '78 Westy in Aunt Gertrude's barn that Uncle Henry
bought just before his heart attack.  The one they were going to tour the
country in, but she has not had the heart to drive it since he died.  She
does go out and start it every six months and sits in it and dreams for
half an hour or so, tho. Very sad, very mint, and less than 100 miles...
and it could be all yours when she moves to the nursing home next month
(or, of course, she could postpone that gift until she dies in 2025, after
the barn rots out and falls on the bus). 

Case #2 You keep searching the classifieds, the auction sites, the local
papers, etc. etc. call all of the owners on everything and finally...
there it is &quot;1988 Volks wagon, does not run, $1000&quot;.  You call expecting a
beat waterboxer that needs heads and it is a 1968 barn beauty, with a
typo.  It is original, under 50K miles, and needs a tuneup that the owner
just never got around to and his wife wants it *gone*.

Case #3, at the other end, you look in a couple magazines, pick the nicest
low-milage, original, unrestored bus they have featured in the last 6
months and call the owner, say &quot;How much?&quot; then pay their price. You
have a low-milage bus for $8-12,000, which has *still* saved you a neat
$20 grand over the price of that new Eurovan!!!

All that being said, back in the real world, you can buy the best bus you
can afford, from $100-5000 and work like hell over time to make it
&quot;yours&quot;.  Whether this would be showroom fresh or custom as all get-out,
makes no difference. Someone (and I have been racking my brain for a
couple hours.. please step up and take credit!!!) once posted during a
similar thread that a bus costs $5000.  Either as a $5000 bus on which you
spend nothing to get it nice or as a free bus on which you spend $5000 to
get it nice.  This will not *always* be true, but it is an excellent rule
of thumb. The cheaper the bus, the more work it will need.  If you set as
your goal to come in with a showroom fresh bus for less than the price of
a new Eurovan, I guarantee you will come in under budget, even if you
spring for the Porsche 6-cylinder conversion!

Now, on to &quot;I give up&quot;.... :-)
