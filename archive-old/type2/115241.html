Subject: Re: [T2] 73 Westy, won't idle, backfires after oil change, new

Okay-

This morning I took my coil, condenser, points, rotor, cap, and spark plug
leads from my working bus, and transplanted them into the '73. No change.

Jay's message below got me thinking though, and out of desperation, I
started messing with my point gap. I found that if I gapped them to 0.030&quot;,
18 Deg dwell (!) it ran reasonably well. WTF?

So, it seems to me that this is a timing issue. What could have happened to
cause this? Will timing the engine just be masking an existing problem? How
do I best time my engine as it will not idle with proper point gap?

Thanks for your help.

Cheers,

Matthew

 Hi Matthew,

 Having ruled out a vacuum leak, it sounds like your problem must be
 ignition based.  You state here that you did not adjust your timing, but
you
 say that you replaced your points in an earlier message.  If the dwell
 changes by even a few degrees it will have an effect on the timing.  You
can
 change timing without an effect dwell, but you can't change dwell without
an
 effect on timing.  Also, did you replace the condenser when you replaced
the
 points?  The symptoms you describe could possibly be caused by a bad
 condenser.
