Just for your info.  I bought a 2 L engine from a salvage yard complete
for $400.  I have had it in my 78 westy for over 2 years.  And not 1
problem.  Keep looking.  Cheap ones are out there if you look.  Also if
you need a good used one.  Let me know I might have one floating around
my shop.

Let me know
