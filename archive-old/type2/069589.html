Subject: List member meeting

Met up with Charles Webb today which was not only my first encounter with a
list member but also my first with an another air cooled  bus period.

Charles and some old  college friends gathered and camped at Lake Lanier for
a few days of Olympic events. Since they had Wed a.m. open I invited them
down for a little vw nuzzling and the men's cycling race. When i told my
daughter we would have visitors from the &quot;net&quot; she immediately warned me that
they could be murderers or at least sickos. I assured her that vw types would
be too busy trying to keep their vehicles running to entertain much mayhem.

The others anxiously headed for Peachtree to catch the race while Charles and
I did the vw thing. They seemed to understand the need to vw bond among the
afflicted. They're off to Athens tonight for the soccer game. Good folks, I
hope the rest of the trip goes well.

Weston
