Subject: Re: [T2] hot engine pictures

Peter Steckhan asked, with no more candour than needed in this case,

&gt;Have you tried that out?

	The 'recipe' for making such pix was not fully intelligible, 
and to the extent it made any sense it was wonky.
	{BTW	A good story told by Temple's biographer Iremonger:
At a meeting of bishops a letter was received, for the severalth 
time, complaining at the Collect for Trinity Sunday on grounds of 
unintelligibility.  Bishop Hensley Henson tried to dismiss this 
complaint by the rather original wisecrack &quot;Some limits must be 
placed on this unnatural lust for intelligibility!&quot; which I suspect 
of being a novel category of joke. }

&gt;
&gt;The image of the bug engine was taken with an infrared camera that is
&gt;sensitive to the appropriate wavelength, and no IR LEDs or lamps were
&gt;used.  The colours are indeed false - the image from the infrared
&gt;camera are the equivalent of black and white.

	The hottest temp explicitly shown on the 'calibration' scale 
was blood T  -  whereas a warmed-up airwarmer has many parts hotter 
than that.  If it's so hot you can't keep your hand on it more than a 
sec or two, it's well above blood T !


&gt;
&gt;As Richard points out, these cameras are not cheap.
&gt;
&gt;The bug engine IR photo can also be misleading - I don't think there
&gt;was any compensation for the different emissivities of the surfaces
being imaged.

	The generator pulley looks about as bright as any part  - 
implying it's at one of the highest temps displayed, even tho' its 
emissivity is lowish if it's shiny metal rather than dull black.

	IR scans might prove useful in early diagnosis of looming 
overheating  -  but this pic doesn't get that project far.
