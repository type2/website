Subject: Re:Steering box crisis? 

 Hi all,
    First Logan said .....&quot;My steering box started leaking sometime this
summer.  While dry this spring, its is now covered in goo in line with the
shaft. Looks like it is leaking from the top bearing &quot;.....

Then John Rogers said......&quot; So here's your dilemma. You may need a new oil
seal, and you may have trouble finding one,&quot;

    Many bearing supply houses also carry a full line of metric and inch
sized seals.  Bring the old one with you, measure every dimension of it, or
get whatever numbers are on the seal and they may be able to replace it for
you.  Open the phone book and make some calls, you'll find someone who has
them.
