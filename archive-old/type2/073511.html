Sue -

Ran into same type of problem with JC Taylor antique insurance.  I 
insure three '69 Plymouths with them - full liability coverage, and a 
total of 10K collision / comp. Total is $151 a year.  Since our bus 
is making the transition from daily driver to occasional camper duty, 
it needs cheaper insurance.  It's at $339 a year for liability only.

Me: &quot;I would like to add my 68 VW bus to my antique policy.&quot;

JCT:  &quot;We don't insure vans.&quot;

Me: &quot;Just VW 's ?&quot;

JCT: &quot;No - any vans at all.&quot;

Me: &quot;It's actually a camper.  You do insure RV's, right?&quot;

JCT: &quot;Not if it's a van.&quot;

Me: &quot;Why not?&quot;

JCT: &quot;It's not long enough.&quot;

You get the idea.........................
