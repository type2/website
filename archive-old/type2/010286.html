Subject: Grrrr... how do I get the damn instrument cluster panel back on...

I have a 75 Westy.

I had to take the instrument cluster off to get at some stuff. However,
I have no idea how the clips are supposed to be attached to replace the
panel.

Can someone walk me through this?

Thanks,
Norm Gall
