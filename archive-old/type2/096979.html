Subject: Re: [T2] Can I clean my engine tins at the car wash?

&gt; Yeah, can I go to the car wash and blast those suckers, or what? Do ya
think
&gt; it will get the grunge off?

Mine were so caked on I had to spend several days using a parts cleaner tank
and wire brushes, and even then I didn't get it all down to the metal.  A
listee had recommended taking it all to a powder-coater, because they can
bake the crap off before coating it.  That's what I'll do next time...
