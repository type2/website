Listees

I am planning to lower my camper, using the tried &amp; tested method of
fitting a Foksy adjuster. However, I've just read the &quot;How To&quot; article in
Volksworld and it says you need a heavy duty balljoint splitter, 27mm and
36mm combination spanners, and possibly a 7lb and 28lb hammer! The large
hammer is apparently for 'persuading' the beam off once all the nuts, etc,
are undone.

Is there anybody who's replaced a beam and can tell me what tools I do
need? I have (what I thought was) a well-stocked tool cabinet, but these
tools are going to set me back quite a bit (I mean, those size spanners are
a fortune!) And does the beam just drop out once the bolts are undone, or
do you really need to force it out with a sledgehammer (sounds dangerous in
the confines underneath a bus).

Any help, hints, etc. on this will be warmly received - hopefully if I have
the bottle I'll go ahead this weekend with it.

73 Devon conversion (soon to be lowered) (maybe)
