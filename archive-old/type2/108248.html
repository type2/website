Subject: RE: [T2] Temp Sensor II, Now what?

&gt; Rather than waving a can of combustible gas around in a
&gt; running engine I'd
&gt; rather pressurize the system and swab/spray soapy water
&gt; on all places where
&gt; leaks might occur.  Safer, and your engine comes out
&gt; cleaner!

Hahahahaha!  This brings an excellant mental picture with it.
Reminded me of those guys in the 1970's TV action shows with the
astbestos suits waiving their arms around wildly.  Don't have to
tell me twice.  Being on fire isn't fun, even if it does look cool
on tv.

I just wanted to say how much I appreciate this list.  The way
everybody kicks in and gives support to those of us on the learning
curve is truly wonderful.  Cause when it comes to tearing down a
motor, I am a total neophyte.  I can understand motor design
conceptually and can look at a catalogue and understand how it all
relates, but actually wrenching it together and apart,.. well,
that's when you all really help out a lot.  I genuinely appreciate
every one of you.  I'm getting misty over here, so I'm gonna develop
some new swear words while banging my knuckles on a few nuts and
bolts.
