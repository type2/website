Subject: RE: racing steering wheel

&gt; To answer the silent question &quot;how much harder could turning the wheel
&gt; possibly be?&quot;, the standard wheel is about 18&quot; OD. Following
&gt; is a table of
&gt; wheel-size and additional force required (rounded to the
&gt; nearest %) to turn
&gt; the wheel:
&gt;
&gt; 17&quot; = 6%
&gt; 16&quot; = 11%
&gt; 15&quot; = 17%
&gt; 14&quot; = 22%
&gt; 13&quot; = 28%
&gt; 12&quot; = 33%

I think the math here is not quite right.  A lever half as long requires
twice the force to achieve the same result.  So a 9&quot; wheel would require
a 100% increase in force to do the same as an 18&quot; wheel, right?  I think
the equation is (Original lever length)/(New lever length) = Fraction of
original force required.  So a 12&quot; wheel would be 18/12 = 1.5, or 50%
more force.  It looks like you extrapolated linearly from the 17&quot; value,
but the change gets proportionately greater with each additional inch
lost from the lever.
