&gt; Hello (;
&gt; I read that you use to have  a 1980 bus
&gt; -I'd assume there is no deferance btween the westie and V'gon.
&gt; (provided) Can you tell me a little about you story w/ the bus, I need a
&gt; little insight. You might have seen my post yesterday. I want to know
&gt; the down side of the model year 1980, I can convince myself that I 

&gt;From our experience I would say do NOT buy a 1980 vanagon.  Our '80 (the
VAN FROM HELL--I am not kidding) was our money pit.  Originally we got
it to have a larger car for the kids and to camp in(it was a Westfalia,
in good condition).  We had it checked over and drove it to south
Carolina, but on the way back it was acting funky.  Running good for a
while, then seeming to lose power.  Thus started our tale of woe. . . 

Eventually we went through about 2-1/2 engines, trying to find out why
it was running good some weeks and like sh*t others.  When it ran bad it
ran really hot, pinging, yadda, yadda.  It ran so bad that eventually it
literaly burned the catalytic converter out--the husband said it looked
like it had been melted, as well as shattered.  The biggest problem was
that this problem was intermittant, not consistent.  We replaced the
&quot;brain&quot;, the air sensor(meter), etc.  Hubby went over all the grounds
and checked them out, cleaned them up and connected them tight, just
short of soldering them on.  Professionals looked at it (VW dealer). It
was the proverbial money pit.

We ended up replacing everything on the engine electrical except for the
wiring harness.  We tried dual carbs on it, they were good, but hard to
keep in sync, and then ran it inbetween smoggings with a single
carb--and it ran fine, but of course would not pass the smog test. 
Since by that time we were disgusted with it and the harness was about
another thousand bucks AND the engine with the FI on was unrunnable--(it
would get so hot that after just starting cold, it would start to ping
idlingso we couldn't even drive it down to get smogged) we started to
part it out and ended up trading it to a mechanic for lots of labor on
my '71 bus (boy did we get the better end of that deal!).

I don't recommend one.  BUT I have heard of  people that have '80s and
love them.  

Ya picks yer vehicle and takes yer chances, I guess.
