Subject: Re: [T2] AIRS Q?

Cool!

An AIRS sticker would look great on Konrad the Tiki Bus, since we're  
registered.

Either way, we'd put one on our bus in a heart beat.

&quot;A man's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy,  
education, and social ties; no religious basis is necessary. Man  
would indeeded be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of  
punishment and hope of reward after death.&quot;
