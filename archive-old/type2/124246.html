&gt; &gt; BTW, I notice that you didn't have a &quot;plug&quot; for the hole in the center
of
&gt; &gt; your fan..neither did I...anyone know where to get one?

&gt; Nope. That part was disconnected in the 1/79 fiche (and even says NLA in
the
&gt; 3/75 fiche). I guess it popped out and VW decided it was a bad idea to
have
&gt; bouncing around in there.

We're talking about the roughly 1.75&quot; plug in the top center of the fan
housing?  Part #36 in the 009-00 fiche file?  Right?
