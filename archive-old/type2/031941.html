Since I'm unsure exactly what I've got in my two rebuilt heads (I 
posted previously about this) and as someone had asked what the effect 
of a flycut of .03&quot; would be on the compression ratio, I decided to 
build my own spreadsheet to calculate compression ratios, and see what 
the effect of an &quot;extra&quot; or &quot;missing&quot; shim between the head and cylinder 
would do to the compression ratio.  The thickness of the head shim 
shipped with the gasket kit seems to be right at .031&quot; or so, just about 
the same as the above-mentioned flycut.

(My problem is that I have reuilt AMC heads and VW heads and I'm not sure 
if I should be using the shim in the AMC heads, or not.)

The figures below labeled (calc) are calculated based on published figures 
for a stock 2.0L Vanagon engine, or &quot;typical&quot; figures mentioned by 
posters.  The (guess) figures come from other posts where people have either 
reported the measurements they've taken or read about.

                                    =======     =======

                                    =======     =======

Clearly the addition or removal of a shim (or flycut) has a big effect on 
the compression ratio.  Looks like I'm going to have to cc the heads or 
risk some problems.  Sigh.
