Subject: Re: [T2] coil question

Is the coil getting a full 12 volts?

Are the points working? Are they burned or pitted.

By the way the voltage regulator has NOTHING to do with the ignition. If 
the bus has enough juice to crank merrily over then it has enough juice to 
fire the coil sufficiently well. The regualtor isn't even doing anything 
until the engine is running over 1000 RPM.

Buy a Muir book and read the chapters on the VW that won't start.

Holler back if you are still having problems.






&gt;  I was driving my bus and for no reason out of the blue, it started 
&gt; running horrible, then 2 mins later stalled and wouldn't start.  i was 
&gt; towed home.
&gt;The problem is electrical, there is plenty of gas getting to the engine 
&gt;and the engine turns over fine.  I pulled the coil wire out of the top of 
&gt;the distributor and had someone turn it over while i looked at the 
&gt;spark.  It was orange and barely there, so i thought the coil went bad.  I 
&gt;changed the coil and same thing.  So i changed the voltage regulator and 
&gt;the same thing.  I just get one quick orange spark and then nothing out of 
&gt;the coil wire.
