&gt;I have a '76 Westy with 103,000 miles on the chassis and about 12,000 
&gt;since an engine rebuild. I'm having a problem with the distributor. So far 
&gt;all I can come up with is either buy a new one (about $500 from Bosch) or 
&gt;buy a used one.
&gt;
&gt;Suggestions? Does anyone rebuild these puppies? Is there an alternative to
&gt;paying the big bucks for a new one. 
&gt;Thanks to all,
&gt;

You can use a standard aftermarket Bosch 009 centrifugal advance 
distributor in your '76 Westy. This distributor is under $50 new. The 
advance curve is slightly different, but not enough to make any noticable 
difference in performance. (I used both in my '77 Westy.)  Also, you will 
have to time your engine based on the timing specs for that distributor 
rather than for a bus distributor.  But the 009 will work fine, and save 
you a lot of $$$.
I'm pretty sure I do have one or two good used Bus distributors lying 
around if you wanted to go that route.  But I'd just buy a new 009 if I 
were you.
