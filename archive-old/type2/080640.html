Subject: Good books - good resources for you


I recommend the Carroll Smith books, Tune to win, Prepare to Win, Engineer
to Win, etc  Outstanding references for DIY folks like us.  Well written
and practical.  Some is only applicable to race cars but much is about
doing things logically and safely.

For the SB Chev the Grumpy Jenkins book The Chevrolet Racing Engine is the
bible IMHOP

snip) 
&gt; Hey folks - just spent the past few weeks reading Smokey Yunick's book on 
&gt; wringing a few extra (alot actually ) horses out of a small block V-8. Lots 
&gt; of good engine building theory though little of it directly applicable to 
&gt; our VW situations. A bit dated but still good information.
&gt; 
&gt; That said - what other good titles do you good folks suggest for the 
&gt; general automotive enthusiast or the VW enthusiast (we are truly a breed 
&gt; apart!!!)?
