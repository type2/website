Subject: bus reonvation begins...

Being a single guy, i spent most of T-day gutting my 71 Westy and
discovering all it's flaws and relative lack of rust etc. Nice shape,
really... Caught the soggy plywood in time and removed all of it down to
the metal and the bus is empty and now clean and scrubbed.

At Home Depot, (toy store for big boys) I was shopping for 1/8 inch
skins and much to my surprise, they have stopped selling them.! Hmm...I
am considering a fiberglass reinforced white sheet panel that they sell,
as it would be waterproof, easy to handle and non directional. Any
comments on this? no wood product in it at all... Sounds good, and at
$24 per sheet, priced ok. also found an really good looking carpet rem
for the floor after i replace the underlay. I'll put this down and then
replace the Westy stuff for a good look. I was also going to use the
extra carpet to  cover the metal over the motor area for a bit of noise
insulation, 

Short of brute force, how do you get the headliner wood out? Slide it
forward? pull down then push edge out? Trick here?  It's in good enough
shape to use as a pattern, as is most of the old wood panelling.

Thanks for the info as i read the digest. This is a fun project.
