&gt;Okay, here's the story.  A friend on mine flew from Indiana to San Jose
&gt;to pick up a car.  He gets out there and the car is not road worthy.
&gt;Since he only bought a one way ticket he is looking for something to
&gt;drive back.  He has about $1500.00 cash.  If you have something or know
&gt;of something please email me right away.  He would prefer a bus but
&gt;anything that he could drive back would be considered.

How do people convince themselves that flying across country to buy a 30 year old vehicle to drive back sight unseen is a good idea?

Personally I think the money would be better spent on a return ticket. $1500 doesn't buy a very road worthy car for a cross country trip as he already found out. I hope he saves enough for the gasoline bill he'll have to pay to get it back home.
