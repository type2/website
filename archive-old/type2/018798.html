well...time to call it quits for the night...well morning here 12:40.
haha...thats love!
I pulled my westy interior....everything is out!  from the front seats
back is bare...the front seats are still in...but thats about all....all
of the panels are still in...but those will come out tomorrow.  as a few
of you know already... I went and bought some roofing tar/fibery kind of
stuff.  like kool patch.  just cheaper...at Fleet Farm.  Everyone around
here said it would do the trick.  I'm cleaning all of the metal/paint
and then coating it with a nice thick coat of this stuff.  This will
deaden sound and keep out moisture.  Moisture is a real PITA up here in
mid-Wisconsin....most of you know it as part of the &quot;rust belt&quot;
then, after all of this dries, I am putting down a dense carpet padding
for the floors.  This will deaden sound further, and give the floor a
nice cushy cozy feel for when I'm camping.  I also bought a bus length
of a thin fuzzy black carpet for all of the interior.  This will go down
over the carpet padding and on some of my panels (kick panels, behind
the driver/passenger seats...you know...the metal part that faces the
back...where the jumpseat and sink are) and will go onto my seat
supports/risers.  Before I do all of this though, I'm getting rid of
any/all of the rust that is on the floors and cargo area.  There isn't
much at all...especially for WI!... but what is there, must go.  then I
will prime that, and cover it with the kool patch stuff.  I am also
removing all of the black strips that are in the cargo area.  These just
collect whatever water that decides to leak in, and rots my cargo area.
There isn't much rust..mostly surface...the paint is starting to peel
off and expose the primer....I don't need this.  Under my bench seat/bed
I have 3 seat belt bases where the seat belts clip into, and one actual
lap belt....who knows why they took the other 2 out!  I decided to do
all of this while I have the money and motivation.  When I went tonight
and bought all of my supplies, it cost me a whopping $45 or so! Fleet
Farm....oh how i love you...
I have days off of work now too...so within the next 4 days, this will
all be done.  I also have the garage to work in...a lot nicer than the
hot blacktop driveway!
busses look sooo much different with all of their interior removed.
what a day! I removed all of this with my mother, and baby sister (1.4
years old...awwww...shes soo cute) sleeping in the house not too far
away (the garage is attatched to the house) and managed not to wake
them...thats talent!

Under my bed/bench seat I found two pipes that come out from what seems
like the underside of the bus....what are these??  They were plugged
with insulation when I bought her.

Stella is leaning a little bit towards the passengers side...what could
this be?  My shocks are shot and I need new ones...but this shouldn't
have anything to do with the ride height...right?

thanks for listening...
hopefully some of you will give some input!
thanks!
