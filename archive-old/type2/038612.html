Subject: Re: Air Shocks
Content-Disposition: inline

I have a set of Monroe air shocks on my camper in Germany. They were specifically made for the type2. Since mine were NOS, the exact same ones are NLA. But I remember asking my German LAPS about air shocks and their catalog still listed Monroe ones, but they were EXTREMELY expensive - something like $170 for the rear pair or so.
I think their air shock line is called Ride Leveler (or something like that). They come with tubing a little pressure gauge and a fitting to inflate with a tire pump.
I was thinking about mounting a little 12V compressor for this purpose. Does anyone know of cars that came with stock air shocks and might be a good source for one of these compressors?

Never say &quot;never,&quot; but I spent hours reading the measurements and
specifications for every make of air shock I could find; the result was
that nothing came close enough to fit.
