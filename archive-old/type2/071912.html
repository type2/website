&gt;I'd prefer my own heads back. Back in the 80's I dealt with Competition

&gt;parts, good service, etc. Is he still around?(He was getting up in years
&gt;15 years ago!)
&gt;Any other good reports?
&gt;I've got an 80 vanagone that needs a top end rebuilt and was considering
&gt;MSHP but now I'll reconsider.

There is nothing stopping you all from sending in your own heads to MSHP
and having them rebuilt and returned to you!!  Then you won't have to deal
with core charges.  Yes your bus might be down a little longer, but not
much.

I visited MSHP recently (in person) and I liked most of what I saw.  First
off, I'm sorry for those who are owed money by them - obviously they are
having some problems, but they are still way better than GEX as far as I'm
concerned.  The staff at Mark Stephens was courteous and knowledgable and
even let me into the shop to see my heads being worked on.  I can vouch for
the fact that they do not rebuild the shot cores!  There was a pallette of
them out in the rain waiting for the recycler.

I think their policy on exchanges is strict, but reasonable.  Why??  Well
how many of you would be willing to rebuild a cylinder head for $160?  You
would have to go out and buy new valves, new guides, new springs,
disassemble the head, cold-tank it, grind the seats and valves (3-angle I
believe), lap the valves, assemble, check seal with prussian blue, check
combustion chamber volume, and more.  That's a lot of work for the money.
If you then expect them to do additional work like welding in the ports or
replacing studs, it's reasonable to expect that to cost extra.  Why?
Because it's extra work!  And why should they do extra work for free?  If
my boss asked me to stay till 8pm every night for no extra money, I'd tell
him to get stuffed.

BTW, I was going to have them rebuild my heads but they liked my cores so
well that I went ahead and swapped them.  I was charged for three studs
that needed replacing, and I think one crack.  They were 1.7 heads that had
never been flycut.  It was worth it to me to not have to have my original
heads shipped back to Texas.

WRT compression ratios, combustion chamber design seems to have a lot to do
with it.  MSHP claims that their engines can be run with higher compression
and no detonation because of their mods to the combustion chamber
(presumably unshrouding and who knows what else).  My Mustang ran on 87
with 9.0 compression but now that I've bumped it to 9.4 I have to run 89.
Supposedly you can also run more compression with aluminum heads than iron
- when I put aluminum heads on the Mustang common knowledge says I can go
as high as 11 to 1 with 93 octane gas, but I'll probably go for 10.5
instead so I can hopefully run on 89, or even 87 if I stay out of the
throttle.  Maybe the Mustang has a more modern combustion chamber design
that allows higher compression - I just bring this up as a data point.
Yes, the type IV is aircooled but it also has better heat dissipation with
the aluminum heads.  I don't see why compression should have to be so low -
our engines would be so more efficient and powerful if we could run 9 to 1
or higher.  Wishful thinking, I guess.
