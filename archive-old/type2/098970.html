&gt;Hi.
&gt;
&gt;On a late bay (1978), are there any instructions/sites that give info on how 
&gt;to take apart the mechankical (the part with the key) ignition switch so 
&gt;that I can get to the wafers to re-key the 'cylinder'??
*******************************
Generally these are a pretty sealed up unit OG lock cylinders.  The
replacements from Hella or Ellen have a tiny roll pin that has to be driven
out to disassemble  Once apart, you pay hell to getting it back together (I
speak from experience on a 73 panel I once owned).  Good ole machined
assembled/press fit.  Now the 68-70 Lock Cylinders can be taken apart and
done with the greatest of ease.

If you're trying to get all the keys matched, most locksmiths will match
the ignition key to the doors - they can be disassembled and re-wafered
with little trouble.  The way you're describing is the hard way IMHO.
