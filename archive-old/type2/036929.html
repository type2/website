Subject: Westy Replacement Pop-Top

Hello all,

With the summer camping season quickly approaching, my wife and I are trying
to complete the outfitting of our bus for camping and adventure.  One of the
main projects is replacing the old pop-top with a new one.

However, I'm having a difficult time finding one of these.  I looked in the
archives and found PLF.  Sent a couple of e-mails and several telephone
calls attempting to purchase one.  I also sent a couple of e-mails and made
a phone call to Bus Depot and Cal Pacific J-Bugs requesting more information
on their pop-tops, but so far I haven't recieved a single reply.

Can anyone suggest who I should go through to purchase a new top?  Also,
anyone have any comments about the quality of replacement top they purchased

Darrin.
