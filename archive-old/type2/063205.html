Subject: 009 in pancake engine

&quot;Morris H. Arthur&quot; &lt;marthur_at_gibbs.oit.unc_dot_edu&gt; is planning to
put an 009 distributor in his '77 camper, but is having a little
trouble with the timing.

OK, the first thing I have to say to you is &quot;don't do it.&quot;  I've
done it, it *will* hose your performance except at one specific
speed/engine load combination, where you might come close to
normal performance.  I've tried it tuned and timed every way you
can do it--the 009 is just plain the wrong distributor for that
engine.  (Muir was talking about Type I engines when he said he
liked the centrifugal advance.)

However, David Schwarze tried to warn me before I did it and I
went ahead and tried it, so if you are like me, you will
probably go ahead too, so here's how to do it.

It doesn't matter that the distributor shaft is lined up
differently from the stock one.  All that matters is that the #1
cylinder be at TDC when the rotor points at the #1 plug wire,
and that the other wires are hooked up for the correct firing
order after that.  So that others can figure out what's going
on, it is a good idea to rotate the distributor around so that
the line on the rim is lined up with the rotor when this
happens, but it's not always possible for various reasons
(breather box in the way, whatever).  On my '72 bus, it's 180
degrees off, even though I'm using the correct distributor.

One way to make sure that you have it right is to get it to TDC
for #1 using the old distributor.  Or you can look down the
spark plug hole with a mirror and a flashlight and check that
both valves are closed and the piston is at the top if you're
not sure.

Then put the new distributor in and rotate the body around so
that when the cap is on, the rotor will be pointing at the #1
wire.  Ideally, the rotor will be pointing at the rim mark on
the distributor too, but like I said, that's less important.

If the turning range of the distributor body is limited, you may
need to rearrange the wires on the distributor cap.  If so, just
be sure to get the rest of the wires in the right order, 1, 4,
3, 2 going clockwise around the cap.  Here's a lame little
picture of which cylinder is which, since when I was first
figuring this out years ago, I remember thinking that &quot;1 4 3 2&quot;
was really unhelpful if you don't know which cylinder is which.

The other thing to get right, is that the points should *open*
just when the engine (and thus distributor shaft) is being
rotated slowly clockwise and #1 reaches TDC (or whatever static
timing setting you're using--with a 009, you're on your own
here).  If the rotor is a bit off from pointing straight at the
#1 wire's contact in the distributor cap (and this would be a
little hard to check anyway) that's OK.

Morris wrote: &quot;What am I doing wrong? or do I have to re-align
the distributor shaft gear such that the rotor points to the
cyl. 1 post AND the points are open?&quot;

Re-aligning the distributor shaft gear wouldn't make any
difference in the timing relationship between the rotor pointing
to a post and the points opening.  To change that, you'd need to
have a different rotor, cap, or distributor shaft.  The slot at
the top of the distributor shaft is in a fixed relationship to
the distributor cam.

I hope this clarifies instead of muddifies.  Let me know how it
goes!

Good Luck!
Dennis
P.S.  You're probably already doing this, but make sure the
distributor shaft is really seated correctly--it's pretty easy
to pre-align the offset tang to match the offset groove in the
engine if you look down the hole.
