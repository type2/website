I just sit the engine on a piece of plywood and use PVC pipe as rollers -
works great!  

Also I leave the rear cross support bar on and tie it to a small pallet. 
Used a chainfall to drop it on my trailer then unloaded at my bulkhead to
the basement - then slid it down on doubled 2 x 4's using a rope tied to
my H*onda.  My wife gudied me as a  drove the car to the bulkhead slowly
letting it slide down the ramp.  No hurt backs or need for lots of
friends (or a really strong one at least)  

Besides David &quot;stonger than my Mustang engine&quot; Schwarze lives too far
away!
