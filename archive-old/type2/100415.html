Subject: 79 showroom westfalia with bad engine please help.

I flew to south Dakota and planned on driving back to Baltimore on friday 
and picked up my new 79 westfalia sage green camper. I started the car and 
headed on my way through the empty state of minnesota. I noticed after a 
little while that the gas was going pretty quickly. I filled it up and it 
kept eating gas so I never have messed with the fuel injection before so I 
was going to leave it until I got home. I had gone through a couple tanks of 
gas and was just getting out of minnesota and I did the math and I was 
getting 11mpg. I also noticed that the bus on a flat straight away could not 
go above 65 and was a real struggle to get it even there. As soon as I hit a 
hill it would drop to about 45. I managed to get to Chicago by the next day 
and the bus felt like it was missing half the engine so I pulled off and 
went to an auto zone and checked if all cylinder were operating and I 
noticed that #3 was not and possibly #4. Hence why at this point I could 
barely hold 50mph. I managed to get into indiana and left it at a shop until 
I can drive out this week and tow it back. I know the engine is a 2.0 and am 
afraid that it is done. I pulled the wire off of #3 and could get nothing 
from it. I am assuming I burnt a valve. Can anyone tell me what they think 
happened and why I was getting such bad gas mileage and was definatelyu 
getting worse the whole time. I did the dipstick checks all the time and the 
engine always felt warm to cool. Will this engine have to be completely 
rebuilt or should I just look into that head. Anyone that has some help with 
this would be great. What would a good rebuild cost and what company should 
I go with. I had to take a shitty greyhound bus all the way back to 
baltimore took me from 9:00pm Saturday to about 6:00 today(sunday)
