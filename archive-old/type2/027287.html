Hi Volks,
   I am looking for some information regarding what it would take to put a 
1600 engine into a 74 bus.  A fellow member of the Long Island Bus Alliance 
has 2 1600s on hand and has an opportunity to pick up a 74 bus for next to 
nothing.  If someone could give me an overview of what's needed I would 
appreciate it, the details can wait until he decides whether to do it or 
not.  I checked the library and there are no articles there on this switch, 
maybe you could point me in another direction.  Thanks in Advance.
