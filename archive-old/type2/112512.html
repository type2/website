&gt;So, what is the correct &quot;factory&quot; procedure for putting the steering wheel 
&gt;on correctly?
&gt;
&gt;Let's say that your front end is aligned as per factory specs...do you 
&gt;drive it and stop in a straight ahead position and then unbolt and rotate 
&gt;the steering wheel till it is at the 9 and 3 oclock position?

The position of the steering box is independent of the tire alignment. I understand what you are asking but basically at the time the alignment is performed it's the time to unhook the draglink, center the steering box etc. Driving to a stop in a straight line will be good enough if there's no alignment in your near future. The library advice is good enough.

There is a punch park on the steering wheel under the button that matches a mark on the splined end of the shaft. Take a look and see if it's not. If not, then you are not factory aligned even if the steering wheel is centered properly.
