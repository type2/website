Subject: Re: [T2] On the road again...

The metal ring is an internal support of the fuel filler bird beck.
It is molded into filler neck right where the bird beck meets
the filler neck body, where the beck seperated in your photos.
I think the ring falls out first. I'm supposing that the PO of your
bus didnt pass visual inspection of the fuel filler neck at the CA smog 
station so he had probably had the necks replaced before the becks had a 
chance to seprate from the filler neck on the other fillers.
3 rings (3 different filler necks), 1 complete bird beck.
