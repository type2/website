Subject: Re: [T2] Hinge Hoopla

When I replaced the hinges on my new/old engine hatch, I used stainless
steel allen head bolts with little stainless steel washers.  It looks
unstock, but you have to look pretty close, and if you do, well, it looks
pretty clean.

As for security, you can pull a hatch off in about 3 minutes, pins or no.
