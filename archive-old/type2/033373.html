Subject: re:hardwood floors in westy

I just finished putting wood floors in my AW. I chose to go with the
pergo-esque tongue in groove method.( groove method not to be confused with
DM :) Wether this is right or wrong, Im not sure yet. I stripped the floor
and applied various chemicles and paints as we all know of to prevent rust
etc. I then placed my Nasa(tm) insulation topped with regular hand fill
insulation and sealed. On top of all that I placed my sub floor. Getting it
level was tricky as hell. It is still off by a few.. but my patience was out
by alot....then I wood glued my main center panel down and glued the tongue
in grooves from the first panel out in both directions. I  have yet to clean
the excess glue and have one more panel to put in( at cargo door.) Not sure
how to finish off that side yet. Once the 1/4 round is in place at the base
of the walls and new cabinets it should look sharp. I cant tell you about
hieght difference because Im making all new cabinets and it wasnt an issue
for me.
     I can say, in closing, it looks &quot;wicked good&quot; from any angle. very
classic and with the tounge in groove kit ($40 at depot 4 foot lengths, the
exact length youll need!) You shouldnt have to worry about spills or any
such thing as they are sealed from glueing much like the Pergo that goes in
homes.(although Im not willing to test that out yet!)
