Subject: Re: [T2] Hard Starting -- Lunchtime Test

Jason,

Cool on both tests, but they point opposite directions!

But! if you preloaded the fuel ring and it went back to starting like it 
used to, progress is being made.

I was just thinking about your eight &quot;pulses&quot;.  Can you translate to 
some number of seconds?  Here is my point....if you can count &quot;pulses&quot;, I 
would say that your starting system was &quot;weak&quot;.

Can you compare how the &quot;pulses&quot; sound versus some other car you have?

A starting system in good shape along with a non high compression engine
should not have &quot;pulses&quot;....If the engine is a high compression hot rod 
engine , then the starter may have a hard time turning it over cause it is 
working so hard against the high compression in the cylinders.

You bus engine starter should turn your engine over briskly and smoothly 
without you being able to hear the &quot;pulses&quot;.

I'm sorry that I didn't realize that the first time you talked about 
it...I think it time to seriously go thru the primary electrical system.

Battery to starter....everything.  Don't forget the trans/body ground 
strap.  Wire brush/sandpaper or rotatry wire brush *everything* and 
reinstall....probably wouldn't hurt to pop the starter motor out and
rotary wire brush the face where it fits into the transmission...do *not* 
try to run it out of the car.

Make darn sure that you have a good ground from your battery.

After you do all of this, then hook up your charger and let it sit 
for at least 30 minutes or so....switch the charger to &quot;start&quot; mode if it 
does that and then try and start the bus as normal...no preloading or 
anything.

My guess is that unless you have a bad/slow starter, it will fire off very 
well.

Let us know!

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt; 
&gt; A few minutes ago, I went outside on my lunch hour and ran a test on my Bus: 
&gt;   I pulled the air cleaner off, switched the ignition on, and pushed on the 
&gt; AFM flap for 5 seconds.  The fuel pump ran (smoothly and quietly -- good for 
&gt; an original) and pressurized the fuel rail.  I then tried to start the 
&gt; engine as normal (clutch in, E-brake on, no brake, no gas).  Eight pulses 
&gt; later, the engine caught and fired on the first try.
&gt; 
&gt; So, now I'm looking at the double relay to see if it's suspect.  If it's not 
&gt; running the fuel pump during starting, it makes sense that the engine would 
&gt; be hard to start.  At the very least, now I can manually run the fuel pump 
&gt; to prime the system until I get it fixed.
&gt; 
&gt; Thyanks again for the help, I'm getting there...
