Subject: Re: [T2] metal heat exchanger patches and spiders

David,

I hate it when that happens...liked your Freudian slip too&lt;grin&gt;.

&quot;I will go back and finish up in a minuet.&quot;

Refering to your dancing around the yard.
Hope your neighbors liked the show....and in all seriousness, that you did 
*not* get bitten!

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hello list,
&gt; Thanks for the tip not to use the fiberglass wrap.
&gt; Well, I was out side making patches to go in the heat
&gt; exchanger when I almost had a heart attack. I made
&gt; some paper patterns of what I wanted the metal patches
&gt; to look like. I them cut out a small piece of sheet
&gt; metal to work with using my air chisel. After that, I
&gt; casually slipped on my old leather work gloves and my
&gt; safety glasses so I could cut out the patches. Well,
&gt; as I was grinding away with my angle grinder, I felt
&gt; this tickling sensation running up my hand. I looked
&gt; down to find a brown recluse spider running out of my
&gt; glove and up the sleeve of my shirt. Needless to say,
&gt; I threw the angle grinder and commenced to dancing
&gt; around the back yard, yelling and stripping off my
&gt; clothes. I am now getting my wits together as I type
&gt; this. I will go back and finish up in a minuet. I am
&gt; sorry if I have wasted your time with my nervous
&gt; babbling. Have a great day! 
&gt;
