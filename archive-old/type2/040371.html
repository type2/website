Steve Dolan,
 
I noticed you have a 1980 Westie just like me. 
Mine runs fairly well, but the idle speed is too slow
when first started (almost stalls), and too fast when
hot. I would love to know a top notch mechanic in our
area who can diagnose this.  The adjustments for idle
speed and air/fuel don't seem to be doing much.  My
idle speed is screwed out 5.5 turns, the air/fuel was
out 13 turns but the screw vibrated loose and I almost
lost it, so now I have it out 10 turns.  As sloppy
as everything is. it's amazing I got it through
emissions.
 
Thanks for the post on wheel bearings.  What price
did you pay for yours, and where did you get them?  I
noticed that Bus Depot has them also.
 
I got rid of the gas smell after fill up by
sealing the leaking left grommet.  VW has a real bear
of a gas tank in these vanagons.  The price at Fairfax
VW for replacing grommets and hoses was $580.  As you
can guess, most of this was labor.  It seems really
tough to get the plastic Y connectors out of the tank
grommets which you have to do to lower the tank (the
cross pipe with Y connectors goes over the shift
linkage, and won't allow the tank to come down). 
I busted one last time I worked on the tank.  I
wonder if anyone has used a special tool to pry these
out. Sealing the leaking grommet was a lot easier
because you don't have to drop the tank.  Of course it
wouldn't be the best idea if the rubber grommets
were 20 years old.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hello All,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm thinking that my problem is bad wheel
&gt; &gt; bearings
&gt; &gt; &gt; or a loose axle nut.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, I agree 
&gt; &gt; &gt; (metoo! metoo! Sorry, just had to get that out
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; my
&gt; &gt; &gt; system :-))
&gt; &gt; &gt; Buy the bearings, replace them.  The whole set
&gt; is
&gt; &gt; &gt; under $60 and there is
&gt; &gt; &gt; nothing like taking this settup apart and
&gt; finding
&gt; &gt; a
&gt; &gt; &gt; dead bearing and
&gt; &gt; &gt; having to wait a week for a replacement to come
&gt; &gt; &gt; mail-order. Get the
&gt; &gt; &gt; replacements &quot;in case&quot;, then install them
&gt; because
&gt; &gt; &gt; you have them.
