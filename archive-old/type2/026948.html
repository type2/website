Thanks George Lyle  ...

You gave me a hidden nugget in your response.  I was wondering what was that 
plastic disk was that seems to just sit over the rotor.  You said  &quot;

&gt;since you have to open the distributor and remove the dust
&gt;cover and rotor just to get at the things.


So I guess that was/is the dust cover. And I should put it back on.

I looked at Haynes and Bentley this morning, and I think my points have the 
grey covering from being closed too much.

And from what I could see, the points were/are not flat against each other 
since the gap I do see appears (oh so very slightly) not an even gap; when 
opened, one edge of the set of points are closer than another edge.

For the first time do-it-yourselfer, this is NOT as easy as I would like it 
to be.  I. e.; Mike Benthin said to rotate the nut on the alternator CLOCK 
WISE.  The Haynes says the rotation of the rotor is CLOCK WISE.  I think, 
but I am NOT sure, that this is incongruous.  ALso, is it just as easy to 
replace the points, as long as I am going to set the dwell  (SURE, you all 
say!!  But remember, this is the first time I am doing this.   Do I have the 
courage to actually pull the points and set the dwell in one step?  The 
points were (professionally) replaced last summer, but the previous points 
had been in the vehicle 4-5 or more years, with over 40K miles on them.  PO 
kept meticulous records, better than me!!)

Anxiety sets in when I am trying to make sure the little foot is at the TOP 
of a lobe.  Is it really at the top, or should I tweak-twist the alternator 
nut one way or the other?  (I have an extra distributor, and I was 
practicing at my bench.  Somehow, the plastic foot on the set of points 
BROKE!!  ///It wasn't my fault, Mom, Bobby made me do it!///  Has anyone 
else seen the little plastic foot break??  No, just ME!!  Anxiety.)

I have an NOS Bosch blister pack, with rotor, points and condenser.  Should 
I replace the condenser too??  Heck, the blister pack is only 7 to 10 bucks, 
if I can find it again!!

My thanks to George Lyle, Al Brase, Michael Benthin and Sean Bartnik for 
responding off line.

I am posting this to the list because it is Friday, and I have the whole day 
off, and my daughter told me last night that the weather forecast for today 
went from thunder showers to sunny.

It's going to be a bright, bright sunshiny day..

its side, wanting to go some where and beat something up..)
