True enough, but we know other things as well. Mike said he wants to 
use the bus as &quot;a summer camp-mobile&quot; and he lives in San Francisco. 
Now, maybe I am inferring way too much. But if I lived in San Francisco 
and had a vanagon and wanted to use it in the summer for camping, I'd 
be heading up into the Sierras -- Yosemite, Sequoia NP -- and to the 
Cascades. So if his engine dies there (and it is most likely to die in 
the place where there is the most stress on the engine), then what? 
Should he save up his money for a tow bar?

As I see it, a person who wants to go camping and who is likely to 
drive steep grades regularly should have the best equipment they can 
afford, so that they spend their time driving and camping, and not 
fixing things or being stranded with concerns about how to get their 
bus home.
