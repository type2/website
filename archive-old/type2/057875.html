I use a 500ml coke bottle to put oil in the engine. I think they come 
in 600ml size now - around a pint I guess.

I keep the coke bottle topped up from a gallon bottle of oil (Shell 
Rimula X 30w). I have to use a funnel to get the oil into the coke 
bottle from the gallon container.

I find that the small size of the bottle means I can up end the 
bottle into the filler and I can leave it there to empty itself and 
there's not enough to run back out of the filler and make a mess.

I've put a mark on the neck of the bottle at the 500ml mark. This
means I can get a fair idea how much I've put in. 

Just thought I share my limited experience.
