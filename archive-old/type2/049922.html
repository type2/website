Subject: [T2] Re: engine problem (the first one)

I've seen some replies to this post but they all seem to focus on the 
second half (battery problem) instead of the no-idle/bucking problem -- 
which doesn't sound like a battery problem.

Not sure what kind of preheating is done on a 72 pancake engine, but I 
know I've had uprights behave like this when the preheat pipe was 
clogged or the air-cleaner preheater setup was gone.  In fact my '71 is 
doing that now.  This doesn't sound like a fuel delivery problem to me, 
especially if the bus starts right back up after it stalls.

Anyone else care to comment on the FIRST problem?

&gt; I have a 72 bus and I have been having problems with it recently.  When it 
&gt; gets real cold out the bus rarely idols it just dies.  So at a stop light I 
&gt; have to constantly keep my foot on the gas the car also bucks a lot when I'm 
&gt; moving mostly starting off in first or when I change gears and the engine is 
&gt; at a low rpm.  I've been dealing with this problem ever since it got cold out
