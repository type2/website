My personal favorite, and one I'd like to get a sticker or tshirt made 
up of is a line from the Larry Niven book 'Oath of Fealty'

&quot;Think of it as evolution in action&quot;

It fits so many situations. Especially on my VW Thing which is 
constantly evolving from a rusty state to painted then back again.
