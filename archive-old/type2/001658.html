Chris,

     Once a year I take the fan out of the housing &amp; clean &amp; lube the
bearings.  I have never had a totally bad fan that would not work.  My
present one will need new brushes someday but after my cleaning it hums
right along.

&gt; If a short or ground were the problem, it is more likely that the fuse
would
&gt; blow immediately when the fan powered up.  If it runs a short time and
then
&gt; blows a fuse, I'd guess that the bearings are worn and are starting to
sieze
&gt; when it heats up after a few minutes of use.  I have seen this happen.  I
&gt; believe that someone on the list recently suggested lubricating them,
&gt; although I have never tried this.

&gt; &gt; Twice now, the heater blower has failed to work, and I'm finding out
&gt; &gt; each time that it's because of a blown fuse. Any ideas on why I keep
&gt; blowing fuses?
