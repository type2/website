Subject: Re: [T2] Brakes!!  Pad, Shoes, Wheel Cylinders

&gt; Hey Everybody,
&gt;
&gt; Anyways,  The rear right wheel cylinder leaks pretty
&gt; bad, a quart in a week and a half.  I am going to
&gt; replace it tonight.  Since I see brake fluid on the
&gt; front of the wheel and tire (facing out) I am sure
&gt; that the shoes are ruined too.  Here is my question,
&gt; while I have done rears and cylinders on my other cars
&gt; (brat, F.O.R.D. etc) I have never done it on the 78
&gt; Bus.  Any secrets, or straight forward?

No real secrets, pretty straighforward.

&gt; Bleeding secrets?

Yes!  The rear brakes on a bus are not self-adjusting.  You pretty much
*must* adjust them tight to the drum before you bleed.  Otherwise the
stroke of the pedal goes into moving the shoes, not pushing air out.

&gt; Oh Yeah, gonna replace front pads while I am at it too. (sat for 6
&gt; years)  Secrets for that?

Pin punch to remove the pins, Vice grip 12LC to compress the piston back
in the caliper.  Nevermind, actually... if you have wet wheels, you are
going to be putting on new/rebuilt calipers.

&gt; Anything to look out for?

OH, my...  a invite to do a rap on brakes! :-)  YOU probably know a lot of
this from other cars, but I am gonna put it all down for the record.

OK, first, general rule...  Always do both ends of an axle!  Never install
one wheel cylinder, one caliper, or one set of shoes or pads.

Second, a whole bunch of random notes from my experiences:

Rears:

As Brian, Sean, and Seth have pointed out, the hubs and drums on late
buses are composite ('71 up), the drums on earlier buses are not.  For
late buses, removing the two small bolts that you will find on the face of
the drum after removing the road wheel *SHOULD* allow you to simply lift
the drum off the hub.  In an ideal world.  Right.  In the *real* world,
Joe is absolutley right that 20 years of road goop works just as good as a
MIG welder to unite the drum and hub permanently.  Of course, if you have
a '68-70, then you have the one-piece hub and drum and you are no worse
off (that is...  #$^_at_'ed :-).

If the drum does not come off the hub, you need a 46mm socket and drive
bar.  For about $50, you can buy the socket and drive bar from Sears, OR
for the same $50 you can buy a 3/4&quot; socket set from Harbor Freight...

http://www.harborfreight_dot_com/cpi/ctaf/Displayitem.taf?itemnumber=5494

The Sears stuff will be better, but a 19mm socket on a 3/4&quot; drive bar is a
wonder at removing the stubbornest lug nuts (and brake calipers.... see
below! :-)  and there are 1/2 dozen other sockets in this set that it is
nice to have.

Once you get the big nut loose, you may find that your hub is rusted to
the splines as well.  Put the nut back on, finger tight, and drive the bus
back and forth a couple times, applying the brakes with a will.  The hub
*will* be loose :-)  Then, once you have the bus back up in the air, road
wheels and big nut off, the drum will hang up on the shoes.  Try
de-adjusting the shoes (good luck!), try rotating the wheel as you pull to
&quot;unscrew&quot; it off, then go down to your local rent-a-tool place (most chain
FLAPS) and get a hub puller.

Now that the drum is off (wasn't that easy? :-), get your digital camera
and *TAKE A PICTURE!*  Note especially the orientation of the clip and
top spring on the bar for the parking brake!  Note that the bar has a
definite orientation up and down and back to front!  *DON'T* take the
other side  apart until you get the first one finished!  In the worst
case, it can act as a model for reassembly.

Pull the bottoms of the shoes out of the adjusters, then the tops of the
shoes out of the wheel cylinder, then rotate the assembly to release the
parking brake cable.  Note that the notch in the hub is there to allow you
to clear the shoes on and off wiht the springs and parking brake cable in
place (and you will *never* get the cable onto its lever with the shoes in
place!)

Buy a set of crow-foot wrenches to remove the brake line from the
cylinder.  Open-end wrenches will just strip it.  Inspect the metal line
closely... would you trust your life to *that* rusty piece of metal?  No
matter what, buy new flex hoses.  They swell shut on the inside, even tho
they look fine on the outside.

Remove the adjusters.  If they won't come out, remove the center screw
with a big vice grip or screw deiver, then run a long bolt down into the
barrel.  When it bottoms, keep cranking and that will push the barrrel
out. On reassembly, be sure to clean the living %&amp;*^ out of the adjusters
and apply a very light coating of anti-sieze to the screw and the outside
of the barrel.  You don't want them as rusty as you found them in a year
or so when you need to adjust again!

Front:

Buy rebuilt calipers.  Shop.  Shop hard.  Prices mentioned on this list
have gone from $29.95 to over $60.  I *think* John Anderson found them at
Autozone in WV for $29.95, but I am not sure.  Check all the chains near
you, Bus Depot, Bus Boys, etc.

Buy new flex hoses!  Again, no matter how good they look, they are
99% likely to be swelled shut inside and feeding degraded rubber scum into
your new calipers.

The bolts that hold the caliper to the steering knuckle have a 19mm head
and you will really love the 3/4&quot; drive set for them... the torque spec on
these is 116 ft/lb! and being in place for 20+ years has not made them any
easier to remove :-)

The pads are held in place by pins that are ~1/16&quot; in diameter.  Get an
appropriate punch, but they are rarely a problem to remove.

I don't think much of having VW rotors turned. Have them mic'd (new is
13mm, minimum thickness is 12mm) and either leave them alone or buy new.

Bleeding

Adjust all 4 rear shoes hard against the drums.  Start at the wheel
furthest from the M.C and work your way back to it.  then adjust the rears
'til they whisper against the drums.  Get in the bus and stomp the brakes
4-5 times and check the rears again.  they probably need further
adjusting.  This can go on half a dozen times 'til they are both adjusted
and centered.

Most of this is standard stuff and if you have done any other car, you
know most of it, but this way it is in the archives (I like the subject
line, it's likely to get hit on any number of searches.)
