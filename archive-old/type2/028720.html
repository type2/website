Subject: Oil Based Enamel Paint?

Searched the archives this morning; then headed down to WallyWorld to see
what kind of paint they had for my wife's yard swing. I had eyed the
Rustoleum the other day and thought &quot;Hey, why wouldn't this stuff work on my
bus if I could get the right color?&quot;

I'm not into form; it's function I'm looking for. In fact, I'm of the
opinion that a bus that looks less appealing is less likely to get ripped
off. I'm happy to have a few flaws in mine. But rust is another story. I'm
looking to get rid of that...and while I'm at it, why not match the paint
instead of going for that colorblind urban camoflauge look?

Anyway, to make a long story short, I ended up at a Sherwin Williams home
paint store and let the guy there let me talk myself into ordering a gallon
of oil based enamel that he's going to color match for me. I left the heater
vent channel for him to use. I figure I'll buff out the good paint on the
bus and then spot-paint as I fix the rust. If I get the time, I'll do the
whole thing someday down the line.

For those of you who know paint...unlike me...what kind of trouble am I
asking for with this shortcut? Keep in mind, I'm not interested in winning
shows or attracting crooks. I mainly want to stop the rust and come out a
little better than someone with a roller or a brush and a bucket of home
latex paint. I figure I'll grind/cut/sand the rust out; then I'll use
POR-15; then I'll use the Rustoleum Brown Rust-Inhibitor Primer; then I'll
spray on this Oil-based Enamel paint.

BTW, I've got a compressor and spraygun and I actually painted a bus once,
using $100 a gallon paint, though I'm not sure if it was the oil-based or
acrylic enamel. It was a Dupont brand, I recall. I got some orangepeel, but
it was a much better looking bus when I was done than it was when I started.

Oh, the Sherwin Williams stuff--$26 for a gallon; about $11 for a quart. My
bus is a blue '72. I'll try to get the formula if anyone wants it.

Thanks! Joe
