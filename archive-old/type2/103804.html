Subject: RE: [T2] [BP] What is this-Is it a compressor??

The cylinder shape with the really narrow bottom where the &quot;rod&quot; would be
makes me wonder if it isn't some type of external combustion engine.  The
electrical wires with fins indicate high current.  Maybe it is a
electrically heated sterling engine. Obviously it has no heads, so timing is
not an issue.  The wiring coming out of the &quot;distributor&quot; could be a magneto
used to recharge the circuits used to heat the hot side of the cylinders.
