Subject: Re: [T2] Highway Speed Oil Pressure

Who posted it to the list that 18 psi at highway speeds was safe oil
pressure to be running ?.
I've just quoted this statement with the assumption that it was right.
I think I'll give the archives a search and see who it was that said that
originally.

&gt; home in the heat was around 250 at 55.  Oil pressure is 20 now when 
&gt; hot
&gt; (60 cold), can be 18 at the lower rpms.  Rarely if ever floor it; 
&gt; shift
