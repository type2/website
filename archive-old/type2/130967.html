Subject: RE: [T2] Brake servo for a '71

I bet soon it will start killing the engine and you will have to plug that 
vacuum. Many of us have used H&amp;R to rebuild servos, it's about 60-70 or so 
including return shipping and they do a great job.  Or you could buy a 
rebuilt one, or a new one....but I think you need special tools to open it 
and replace the diaphram.

&gt;Is the servo easy to rebuild if necessary?
