Subject: Re: [T2] Pesky heater cables.

Had this discussion with my local VW guru last week.  He said that  he has tied a rope or long wire to the end of the cables, wrapped it  around the bumper of another car, and VROOM.  It pulled them  through.  He said it was the ONLY way they'll go through in some  cases.  No, I'm not kidding.  Cheers...KR

get them installed today.  The installation looks easy, you pull the 
old cables out, and feed the new ones in.

  I disconnected everything in the back, fed the cables down under the 
front of the van, attached a pair of vice grips to the front end and 
pulled.  The cable housing stretched about three feet, but everything 
else stayed inside.

I tried pulling on the cable to the other side, it isn't budging.

So... what's the trick to get the old cables out.  I'm assuming when I 
get them out, I should oil the outside of the new cable housings to 
make them slide in easier.

But I have to get the old ones out first.

Thanks in advance for the tips!
