&gt; ICBC the insurance corporation here in BC... does the same thing... rates it
&gt; as a Kombi. However, If you can show that the vehicle is a mobile-home it
&gt; can rate under a camper.
&gt;
&gt; To rate it as a camper it must have:
&gt; Sink
&gt; Sleeping Area
&gt; Stove
&gt; (and/or Toilet)
&gt;

ICBC rated both my old 78 Westy (which had no stove) and my current 77 (with a stove) 
as
a mobile home.
