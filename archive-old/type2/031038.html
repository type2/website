&gt; I am currently parting out the carcuss of a 78 Westy.  It has a (what I
&gt; think is a) owner built camper interior with Z bed, sink base, table and
&gt; cabinet as well as extra seat.  All birch construction and in good
&gt; condition.  I don't have a use for this but don't want to throw it away.
&gt; IT'S YOURS FOR $50.  Come and get it!

I don't need the whole thing, but would like a fridge, table, and single
seat (rear facing)
  would love to take em off your hands,  it's the &quot;Come and get it&quot; that's
the problem.
