&gt; we stopped in Oray and went swimming in the huge pool in
&gt; &gt;town fed by natural spring waters. What a great way to
&gt; &gt;unwind after a drive like that.
&gt; 
&gt; Ah, Ouray.  I almost hate to mention it, as I hope it stays like it is until
&gt; I hit the lottery and can go there permanently.  They have this outdoor pool
&gt; complex that is in (if I remember correctly) five sections, divided by
&gt; top-of-the-water height walls between the contiguous pools.  The hottest is
&gt; like the hottest hot tub you could really enjoy, all natural hot springs
&gt; water, up to your waist or so.  It's what, maybe 30' square?  More?  Soak a
&gt; while under the stars.  Then you roll over the wall and into the next pool,
&gt; a little cooler with river water mixed in, and up to your chest.  Swim
&gt; around, catch snowflakes on your tongue, then roll over the next wall to a
&gt; slightly cooler pool, up to your chin.  Swim laps, point out constellations
&gt; to your kids, wonder how many other places there are like this.  Keep going
&gt; from one pool to the next, each larger and not so hot, until you're in the
&gt; deep end of the biggest pool, a full size race worthy pool with a diving
&gt; end.  Year 'round, a stars only roof on the place.
&gt; 
&gt; I wouldn't spend a week in Disneyworld if you paid me to, but my Ouray
&gt; postcard lives in my cubical at work, just to remind me there really are
&gt; places like that.
&gt; 
&gt; And there's a  B&amp;B there that has a natural hot tub grotto in the basement.
&gt; Honest.
&gt; 
&gt; Sigh.
&gt; 
&gt; OK, before Friday is over:  what's the coolest place you've been to with
&gt; your bus, or want to take it back to?
