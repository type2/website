X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL - A

Depending on how thick the plywood is, a biscuit cutter is a good way to
glue plywood sheets together. Both Porter-Cable and DeWalt make good
ones, but Elui is best, but pricey. If you search the local thrift stores
and yard sales, a table tennis/ping pong table is big enough to be cut to
size for a one piece floor.
