Subject: I have pressure! - was Re: [T2] no oil pressure on fresh
  rebuild

Thanks for all of your input.  Pump primed, cranked some more, light 
turned off ;)

Ok, I now I gotta go creep the bus over to a parking lot and break in 
the engine for 20 mins.

After I do the 20 min run, I need to check the valves, right?  That 
means it needs to cool all the way down, huh?  solid valves..  yay ;)

thanks for your help!
Mike

&gt; mike,
&gt; 
&gt; this may or may not be normal behavior, depending on how long you
&gt; ran/cranked the engine for. it can take a while to get the oil everywhere in
&gt; a new engine. what kind of oil pressure switch do you have installed? it is
&gt; difficult to trip a VDO dual pole sender by cranking the engine only.
&gt; 
&gt; try this: remove the oil pressure sender and crank the engine (no plugs,
&gt; ignition disabled) until the oil comes out the sender hole. it is also a
&gt; good idea to pre-fill the oil filter on a new rebuild (i always fill the
&gt; filter on every oil change, in fact).
&gt; 
&gt; so long as you used lots of assembly lube, the engine is fine.
