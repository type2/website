Subject: Somewhere in AZ. . . . 

Long story short - my 82 Vanagon is dead in Casa Grande, AZ.  On a trip 
from So. CA to Dallas, TX I was about 1/3 the way there on Saturday 
morning and the engine melted down.  (Is it a bad sign when smoke is 
coming from the air vents on the back sides of the Vanagon?) 

Some generous people are presently taking care of the &quot;Brown Beast&quot; and 
trying to locate an engine.  I thought I may run this past the list and 
see if anyone may know of a source for a used engine or other advice.  I 
wasn't real keen on the idea of pulling it back since U-Haul wanted over 
$600 for the truck to pull it one way.  With that kind of money, I would 
have a good start on getting the engine replaced.

Any ideas short of a proper washing and cremation would be appreciated.  
Thanks!
