Subject: Re: Pertronics adjustment

John,

Now you know why my Pertronix lives in my tool box,
instead of in my distributor;-)

My first unit failed out of the box. The second unit
worked, but I had to time it the way you have, and I
didn't feel secure driving my bus that way, so I
pulled it.

I would be curious to know the answer on this
question, too. I'd like to be able to run mine safely
(I *did* pay $50.00 for it, after all;-).

I wonder if the Compufire's have this problem???


Jaime

&gt; Hello everyone.
&gt; I just installed a Pertronics Ignitor in my 72 type
&gt; 4 dual vacuum
&gt; distributer. It seems to work fine except that I
&gt; can't get the same timing
&gt; spread I got when it had points. Before it idled at
&gt; around 4 degrees ATDC
&gt; and tops out at about 38 degrees BTDC. Now in order
&gt; to get the 38 degrees
&gt; of advance needed to run normally I have to advance
&gt; everything and end up
&gt; with 4 degrees BTDC at idle, an 8 degree difference
&gt; from before. Is there a
&gt; reason for this?  What can I do to make the timing
&gt; spread more normal?
&gt; What would be the highest advance I could run
&gt; without overheating or
&gt; otherwise damaging the engine?
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you all.
