Anyone serious about heat in you bus/van should have a look at G. M.
Bulley's pages at http://bulley-hewlett_dot_com/VWindex.  A ton of good
heat/noise/rust info.

&gt;Hi folks,
&gt;
&gt;Well, it's starting to get cold here and although I don't plan on driving
&gt;my camper much in the winter months, I would like to take it
&gt;once in a while.  So I have a stock 1600 dp with NOS heat exhangers from
&gt;The Bus Depot,  since I've never really driven my camper yet I was
&gt;wondering how well they work when temps get down into the teens.  My
&gt;camper(70 Westy) isn't perfect in the door seal area but I plan on fix-
&gt;ing that soon.  Should I bring a sweater for city driving and long
&gt;sleeve shirt for the highway?  All the ducting under the bus is in great
&gt;shape and I have the belly pan.
&gt;
&gt;Just curious.
&gt;
