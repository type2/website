&gt; Respectfully disagree. The post referred to in the archives was possibly mine.
&gt; My 69 double cab has a heat tube in it made of 2&quot; PVC schedule 40 DVW. Even
&gt; though I've not driven it recently, I do believe it is still quite intact.

Al,

No worries, mate..  yer allowed to do that :-)

My only experience was a bus in a junkyard that had a plastic pipe, I
*think* it was PVC (DWV grade, smaller than stock, but I did not measure).
That pipe had obvious heat damage, saggy looking.  I saw it and thought,
&quot;check, not this stuff.&quot;  It may have been the earlier incarnation, as I
remember some early plastic pipe having problems with heat.

I dunno, volks... I like the metal pipe idea, especially wrapped in
fiberglass, but Al's PVC seems to be holding and he knows whereof he
speaks... make up your own minds.

For my '73, I bought a section of the metal ducting at Home Despot and
shrank it. I have a good set of snips and the sheet metal vice grips with
4&quot;  wide jaws.  Took about 1/2 hour to cut it down and remake the edge.
Works just fine.
