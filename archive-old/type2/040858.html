Craig-

When the sender senses a loss in pressure, it closes it's
contacts,
thus completing a pathway to ground.

For the buzzer to work, hook one wire of the buzzer to a constant

source of +12V. Connect the other wire to the sender. No current
will flow as long as the pathway to ground is not complete (ie
you
have good oil pressure).
