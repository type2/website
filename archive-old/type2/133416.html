&gt; On another note we're going to Philly, PA to buy a Cabrio this weekend

yeah, North of Baltimore, South of New York...

&gt; Anyone got any good suggestions for places to eat and sleep? Looking for

try Newark Delaware, seriously, I would stay at the Holiday Inn exit 3
North.  if you really want to stay near Frankfort, there are a lot of
decent motels on the NJ side of the river there, take any bridge over and
avoid the $$$$ of staying in Philly,  I wouldn't stay anywhere near
Frankfort area especially at night, not bad but not a place to be lost at
night. (IMO)

&gt; a non-franchise more or less $20 meal (what restaurant would you miss if
&gt; you moved away from Philly for a while?) and a decent hotel/motel not in
&gt; a scary part of town (made that mistake in Ashville once). Dealer is in
&gt; Frankford and we are arrived and departing on I-95 north.

they are working on the roads in the Frankfort part of town, especially
around the Subway terminal.

take the bypass around Wilmington (I-495)  forget where your coming from
but if you are going all the way South of Richmond I would HIGHLY
reccomend the 3/301 bypass around Washington DC, (unless you really want
to see the touristy stuff and don't mind some of the worst traffic in the
USA.

Take the I-895 tunnel thru Baltimore much shorter and easier tunnel than
I-95

If you need help I'm in the AIRS list where I-895 and I-95 come back
together on the North Side of Baltimore  (Moravia rd exit)

have a safe trip, watch for speed traps I-95 DC line to Fredricksburg. at
I-95/I-895 split (sudden speed reduction to 50mph on a downgrade, they
really mean 50mph) also from Susquehanna river to Delaware line.

wave if you see my blue/white 78 with canoe on the roof when going up I-95
