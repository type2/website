Subject: &quot;Hammering&quot; sound in 81

Acouple of weeks ago while I was returning from the store with my son when we
suddenly heard a loud hammering sound that lasted for about 2 seconds and
then quit. At the time I was doing about 25 up hill and in a hard right
curve. It was definitely a mechanical sound of the sinking heart variety but
I wasn't even sure that it was us since there was no effect on the vehicle.
The thumping was less than 10 per second, in other words less than what I
would expect of a reving engine. With no repetition, I forgot about it or at
least wished it away.

Now this weekend I take a 150 mile jaunt to the mountains and virtually the
same thing happens and under about the same circumstances; up hill and in a
right turn doing about 25 for about a second and then pause and then another
second. Didn't experience it again for the balance of the trip or the return.
What was different this time was that I had the windows up so it wasn't
nearly as loud and I had the impression that it was coming from the front end
of the van rather than the engine. Again no effect felt, just noise. 

Any ideas? Responses a long the line of &quot;Oh yeah, that's normal&quot; would be
preferred.

Thanks,

Weston
