Heading out to the mailbox yesterday and was stopped dead in my tracks.
There in the parking lot is a 70 bay with a dormobile top. Gotta stop and
take a look. Turns out it not only has a Dorm top, but also has the semi
rare so-69 westy interior which comes with the bench seat plus its got a gas
heater. Now my girlfriend wonders why I'm so weird that I had to call her
and tell her about it. &lt;sigh&gt;
At least you all will understand.
