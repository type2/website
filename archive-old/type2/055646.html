Subject: Dual Solex PDSIT Rebuild Query

Hello fellow listees:

I will probably make another effort to make my Weber progressive
drivable (chiefly by devising an intake pre-heater, but also just by
making another go at the tuning), but while I have the engine out, I
figured I might put some effort to assemble a stock set of dual solex
PDSIT carbs for my 1974 Westfalia (2.0. liter hyd).  I’ve searched the
archives for likely problems to look for, and found the following:

1) worn/loose throttle plate bushing (several listees report this)
2) worn/loose linkage
3) linkage too short for engine (?) (Eric Keppel)
4) bad/missing enrichment/lean-out resistor unit (Jim Thompson)

Is there anything else for which I should be on the lookout?  Mine seem
to have worn throttle plate bushings, though I have nothing to which to
compare them.  The linkage feels alright to me, and I won’t be able to
tell if it is too short until I get the heads back on my 2.0 liter (I’ve
got .090 cylinder spacers, but the heads have been flycut at least once,
I suspect).  I can’t figure out where the squarish resistor unit Jim was
talking about would go, exactly, but i don’t seem to have it, and I’m
not sure from which years the pairs I have are (any tips on this?) he
The manifolds for one pair are longer than the others, apparently to
make room for the EGR piping mounts -- which reminds me, do I want to
keep this piping, minus the connections to the heads, as a balance tube?
