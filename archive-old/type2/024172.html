Forgive me for posting this to the entire list, but our email is screwed up,
and this is the only way I can get ahold of him.

Karl,
I wish to buy the AFM from you.  Please send me the address where I should
send the money.  
Please accept my appoligies that my email hasn't gotten to you.  We are
having problems with our email system.

How much do you expect shipping to cost?

Thanks again,
Marcus
