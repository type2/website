Subject: [Fwd: [T2] Thermostat temp?]

Hm.  Guess I hadn't enuf caffeine in my ssystem when I posted this... 
The diff is actually 'bout 36 degrees farenheit, 20 C.

Seems to me this is a significant difference - keeping the flaps closed
longer and resulting in the heads heating up more.  

Anyone else???
