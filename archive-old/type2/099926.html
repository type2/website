Subject: Re: [T2]  help!

&gt;He can't find a place to store it and may have to sell it. It's a 
&gt;great bus but he has some time constraints to deal with here. He's 
&gt;coming out to Denver Friday for 3 weeks so has to find a place to 
&gt;store the bus tomorrow (Thursday). The tags and insurance have 
&gt;expired so he'll have to have it towed somewhere I guess.

Sorry if this sounds harsh, but isn't the obvious thing to get the insurance
and tags current and put some air in the tires?  There are some
responsibilities associated in owning any vehicle and these are pretty basic
ones.
