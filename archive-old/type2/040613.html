Chris:
you didn't mention that the valves were adjusted, even
a little loose, for this test.
and no, the oil squirt test is for rings, adds nothing to
valve sealing potential. and quiz this: if you squirt oil in to
temporarily seal the rings , where does it go to do that?
i've seen other engines, like where the piston is vertical,
and the oil distributes all the way around the ring sealing
surface. and unless it does, then what ?!
new exhaust valves are $ 3 each, and $ 6 for a pair. a $10 tool
installs them, and affords a look at the seats and guides.
a Time Sert spark plug repair is better than original- the threads
are steel...
