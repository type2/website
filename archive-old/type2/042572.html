Subject: Re: high top conversions

Adventurewagen made a high-roof conversion for the Vanagon. Alas, I have
not seen one (yet), but research on the Internet turns up these tidbits:

Here's the scan of the brochures I found under the seat of my 73:

Adventurewagen moved from Sylmar, CA to Fort Bragg, CA (not sure when)
A blurb on a Mendocino County commerce web site says: &quot;During the past
three decades, Adventurewagen has produced more than 12,000 compact
motorhome conversions.&quot; [The Adventurewagen link is 404.]

1986 AW Vanagon FS (no pic, wah! but I wrote and asked for one)

&quot;...the owner of Adventurewagen is retiring [96-98?] and it was our last
chance to move up from our 1988 VW Adventurewagen. (When the VW Vanagon
was discontinued in the US after 1991, Adventurewagen moved to the
[Ford] Club Wagon)....&quot;
