Subject: tires again

Yeah sorry to bring this up, but I just finished chatting with Brian at
etire and he states the ONLY reinforced 14&quot; tire they carry is the Goodyear
Marathon in 205/75-14. He says the Yokohamas and Bridgestone 603Vs on their
website are out of stock with no ship date... He has nothing for Nokkians
either.
