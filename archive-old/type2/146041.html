&gt; OK listers,
&gt; Need your opinion.  My sons 68 Type II requires a new engine.  Here are my
&gt; choices.  Let me know what you think.
&gt;
&gt; 1.  Buy a used 1600 which is said to have been rebuilt ($1,200 installed)
&gt; 2.  Buy from source like GEX or other new long block w/ 36 month guarantee
&gt; ($1,200 just for the engine)
&gt;
&gt; Also what size engine would you folks put in this old bird. 
&gt;
&gt;
You can buy a new, new minglewood blue 1600 from Mexico...

(I'll leave the GEX responses to others...My momma didn't
raise me to use that kinda language... ;-)
