The Inuvik Run -- Doing the Split

July 25 - Laird Hot Springs

It is twenty-five past ten in the evening.  The sun has set but
the sky is white, a curiously bright twilight without the usual
rosy reds, it is just... white.  People are strolling about,
there is no darkness in the literal sense yet there is no sun.  

I am near sixty degrees north latitude, parked in space number 14
at the Laird Hot Springs Provincial Park in the northern-most
slice of British Columbia, 2,672 miles north from San Diego.  I'm
sitting in the bus because if I sat outside the mosquitos would
be in my nose and ears and mouth.  The mosquitos of Ten Mile Lake
showed some respect for bug juice but these hot-spring mosquitos
are an entirely different proposition.  They pay absolutely no
attention to the advertised claims of Johnson &amp; Johnson, Cutter,
or any of the other makers of insect repellent, which is a real
disappointment.  Bug spray is expensive and bug bites are
painful.  I am poorer by several dollars yet covered with itchy
lumps and scabby little wounds.  

&gt;From Fort Nelson the itinerary had us traveling to Laird Hot
Springs, a mere 260 miles but none of it truly flat.  Since the
run was so short I decided to stay with the group rather than
leave early.  The next morning I waited until everyone was on the
road then fell in as Tail-End Charlie.

This was the most pleasant run I've had since leaving San Diego. 
For the first time, I traveled with the Inuvik group as a convoy
and it was fun.  By goosing the old bus on the down-grades I was
able to keep up with the convoy.  Well, sorta keep up.  That
lasted until noon.

The convoy stopped for lunch at Muncho Lake in a remarkably
pretty alpine valley.  The convoy splintered there, some pressing
on to the hot springs while others chose to take a swim.  The
lake is about 3,000 feet above sea level and while the air was
cool the sun was blazing hot.  The waters of the lake however
were liquid green ice.  I decided to pass on the swim.  I ate my
lunch of sardines, apples and crackers, sitting in the sun reading a
book.  Seeing no signs of movement from the picnickers, after
lunch I hit the road.  Eddie Heintz and his dad soon appeared in
my rear view mirror and I moved over to let them pass.

Between Muncho Lake and Laird Hot Springs we had to avoid
caribou, a solitary bison and whole flocks of mountain sheep,
attracted onto the roadway by the chemicals used to de-ice the
concrete bridges and other portions of the road.  We also saw a
small band of wild horses, the stallion neatly herding his
pregnant mares off the roadway with well placed nips
then stationing himself between us and them and we rolled past. 
The animals were in good condition with no sign of
lameness or split hooves.  There are shaggy Siberian ponys that
live north of sixty but I had no idea wild American horses, which
are of Spanish-Arabian descent, could survive so far north.  

By the time I arrived at Liard Hot Springs most of the group was
hanging on my bumper, their later-model vans having no trouble
making up my slim lead.  We had reserved spots months before and
my space was clearly marked.

Most of us took a dip in the hot springs.  We started at the Beta
Pool, a murky pond smelling strongly of sulphur.  The grayish
water was about one hundred degrees Fahrenheit.  The Beta Pool is
about fifty feet across and deep enough for swimming.

The women in our little convoy are young and pretty whereas the
typical camper at Laird Hot Springs is elderly, usually driving a
sixty foot motor home that cost as much as Nova Scotia.  Many of
these septuagenarians have grandchildren in tow.  When Yvette and
Jorge decided to take the plunge in the Beta Pool there was a
gaggle of teenage boys already there, most daring each other to
get into the hot, sulphur-smelling water.  Yvette removed the
towel from around her shoulders, displaying the top of a micro-
mini bikini.  She then removed the modest bloomers she wore over
the rest.  Two things were immediately evident.  Her bikini was
of a type and size suitable only for very slim young ladies who
make a habit of shaving in an interesting place.  The other
things that were immediately evident were the pronounced bulges
in the bathing suits of half a dozen tow-headed teenage boys, all
of whom sought refuge from their embarrassing condition by
thundering into the pool en mass, submerging themselves neck-deep
in the steaming water and remained there, red as lobsters for the
whole time Yvette was at the pool.  As we left, the boys were
helping each other out of the water to collapse on the wooden
boardwalk in a parboiled state.

Lower down the hill is a hotter spring of crystalline water.  The
hot stuff is contained by a small dam over which it spills in a
natural shower.  Below the dam the clear hot water mixes with the
murky run-off from the Beta Pool and frigid water from other
springs.  Most of the Inuvikerrs where there and it was very
pleasant.  A few of us tried the hotter water.  It proved cooler
than a Japanese bath and very refreshing, were it not for the
horseflies, black flies and mosquitos.

Laird Hot Springs is a remarkable place, worth a second
visit.  Although located north of the 59th parallel the constant
supply of warm water from the springs supports an incredible
variety of temperate-climate and even tropical plants.  And an
equally enormous mosquito population.  

Tomorrow the plan calls for taking the unpaved Klondike Highway
between Watson Lake and Carmacks.  Back when the itinerary was
first discussed I opined that given the age and condition of my
bus I thought it best to stick to paved roads whenever possible.
I have to drive the unpaved Dempster, there's no other way to get
to Inuvik.  But there is pavement all the way to Dawson. Driving
the 373 unpaved miles of the Klondike Highway would increase the
risk of mechanical failure for little return -- it's all new
country to me, one route as spectacular as another.  So tomorrow
I pull out of Laird Hot Springs heading not for the lead mines at
Keno but the Safeway in Whitehorse, about 412 miles away.

(After trip comments:)

The women in our convey were all young and pretty, every one of
them.  Age and appearance has nothing to do with it. - rsh
