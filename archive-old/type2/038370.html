Subject: A Metwiz Star is Born

Kelly Brown aka the Metwiz was sighted on local TV welding up Neil's (A.S.S.
chapter of NEATO) 1958 Deluxe. Also featured were Gene Hickman and his
beatiful 67 deluxe which was cut and welded by the Metwiz. Off-color
comentary was provided by some hack in a baywindow bus :)

Could be a quicktime version of this floating around soon :)
