&gt;I pulled the engine out of our parts '72 Bus.  This is the engine
&gt;with the oil filler and dipstick on top - probably out of a 411/412
&gt;or possibly a 914.  The serial number on top of the block is
&gt;EC014374.
&gt;What does this serial number indicate?

The EC series are 1974-1976 914 1.8 engines.  
Originally Bosch L-jet fuel injection.  
Displacement is 1795cc.
Rated at 76 DIN HP at 4800 RPM.
Compression ratio is 7.3:1.

Judging by the low serial number, the engine is probably from a 1974 car.
