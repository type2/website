&lt;&lt; These aren't necessarily easy to find if you don't know to 
look.  One of these latter screws is also obscured behind the starter, 
so you might want to drop the tranny a litle farther down.

Radio Shack has a nifty little ratchet wrench that takes 1/4 inch hex
ended bits... NOT a heavy duty tool but useful for tight spaces where
even a stubby screwdriver might not fit...It's in the Boy-when-you-need-
this-you-really-need-this tray in my tool box... ;-)
