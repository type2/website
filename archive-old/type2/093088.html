Subject: Re: [T2] Dixie Bus trip report My turn

Have you pulled out the idle jets??? That is exactly the habit my '73 Super 
Beetle 40 HP carb had when i was living in Italy.

They added dye to the fuel so that there was a tint to the color of the 
fuel and it could be identified by the guys at the stations.

Some of the dye was ground up fine enough and would create a sediment that 
would get stuck in my idle jets.

I would simply pull them (outside of the carb so it was easy) and spray 
them with a bit of carb cleaner.

Then I would suck on them to see if they flowed correctly.

After that came three tanks fuel of gas and STP ala Muir.

Worked every time and all was well.

Cost? $3.

Carbs generally dont just stop working...The jets wear out, the throttle
&gt;shaft bores wear out (to bad solex didnt bush'm when they
&gt;built'm!)...floats go bad, idle cutoff solenoids die...chokes stop
&gt;opening...but none of that requires replacement of the carb. (well, it's
&gt;debatable with regards to bushing the throttle shaft bores..)
&gt;
&gt;I suspect your bus is randomly stalling out at idle?  Sometimes it'll
&gt;idle, sometimes it wont?  (you only mention having checked the timing..)
&gt;Have to looked at the cutoff solenoid?  Often this little guy will work
&gt;his way loose from the body of the carb...and cause this /exact/ problem.
&gt;Just tighten it back up and you've saved yourself $200 or so dollars.
&gt;
&gt;If it wont idle at all, i'd check to be sure that the solenoid is
&gt;working...(assuming it's tight!)  With the engine not running, turn the
&gt;key on and pull the little wire off of the solenoid.  Spark warnings apply
&gt;here so be careful.  Now, tap the wire back to the contact...you should be
&gt;able to hear the solenoid &quot;click.&quot;  Pull the wire off and tap it back on a
&gt;few times just to be sure.  Clicking?  Keep looking. Not clicking?  Lets
&gt;be sure we still have voltage to the wire.  This wire should be attached
&gt;to the key-switched side of the coil and should get +12v when the key is
&gt;turned on.

The other problem that i had occasionally was that the timing would be off.
