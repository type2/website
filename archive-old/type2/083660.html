&gt; The indian peace sign is the swastika in reverse.  There was a car in the
&gt; early 1900's called the KRIT, and the logo they had on the radiator shell
&gt; was this indian peace sign.  Of course no one thought anything of it at the
&gt; time.

Actually, they went both ways.

&gt; There is a 1913 KRIT in the National Automobile Museum in Reno, NV.  The
&gt; KRIT is the first car you see when you enter the collection; it is a
&gt; beautiful car.  People are constantly insisting that the insignia on the
&gt; radiator offends them and demand that the car be removed.

We had a similar hue and cry here when somebody realized that some of the
folks at Van Nuys airport flying military trainers had a couple in WWII
Luftwaffe livery.  They had been that way for a decade!

&gt; The collection also has a marvelous red 64 Beetle convertible.

I remember it from its heyday as &quot;Harrah's Automobile Collection&quot;.  It
took two days to get through it back then, but they sold off a lot of the
vehicles.  Bill Harrah insisted that all the vehicles on display be
drivable.
