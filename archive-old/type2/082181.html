Subject: Re: [T2] 2WD to 4WD conversion

&lt;&lt; hello all,

heres what i'm wondering. would it be possible to get
a viscous coupling and some half axles and convert
your 2WD bus into a Syncro?  &gt;&gt;

My guess would be that with enough money, yes.

My other guess would be that same amount of
money would buy a Synchro and gas for a couple
of years.
