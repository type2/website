Snoopy sends:

&gt; Over Christmas I decided to take a couple weeks to tool around the Blue
Ridge
&gt; Mountains and the parkway.  Well the parkway was snowed over so just
camped
&gt; whenever and wherever I could on back roads.  Well I brought the AAA camp
&gt; guide and one night it was getting dark so I decided to go to FOX TRAIL
FAMILY
&gt; CAMPGROUND.  It is in Fancy Gap, VA.  Well it is about 5:30 PM and the
gate is
&gt; half open when I pull up.  So I drive in and go to the office. Other
people
&gt; are camping. Well the office is dark and no sign about late check ins like
&gt; most camp grounds so I turn around and start to head back out.  As I am
&gt; pulling away the host comes down from the house and asks what I am doing,
I
&gt; tell him I was just looking for a place to camp, saw the office was closed
and
&gt; was just leaving.  Well he pulls a gun and aims it at the under side of my
bus
&gt; and says I thought you were leaving. And I did.

Tell me you reported this to the consumer affairs section of the Virginia
Attorney General's office.
