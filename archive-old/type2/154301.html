Subject: Re: [T2] Shipping costs

Terry spouted his usual BS again.

I mail stuff  EVERYDAY. I damn near have a reserved parking spot.

People get the stuff I mail via Priority Mail 3 to 4 days before I get the check they mail 1st class at the
same time!

I don't read propaganda on the internet, just your rantings.

Maybe it is your post office in Podunk Illinois??  When you take a 1 lb package to the post office, do they
have a screen you can read that shows the weight and $$ for each choice? Look again at the screen. It also
shows approximate travel time. Priority will say 2-3, 1st class will say 4-6. That 1st class may get there in
4-6 days but I doubt it.
If your Priority mail doesn't make it in 2-3 days, then they aren't feeding the horses at your Pony Express
office.

&lt;&lt;No sir, do a little research. Priority is 2-3 days, 1st class is 4-6
 days.&gt;&gt;

 No Sir.
 Go ask the tootsie's behind the counter at any USPS office.
 No guaranteed delivery times via Priority Mail.

 Take two envelops.
 Put a first class stamp on one.
 Put a $4.05 stamp on the other.
 Mail them both to Bangor Maine.
 They'll both get there at the same time--or the first class will get
 there first.

 Here's another case of believing what you read on the internet Karl---
 Don't.
 It's all Propaganda

 I've been there, done it, and seen it all.

 I oughta file a class action suit on the PO for false advertising.

 Priority Mail isn't what it used to be.
Only guaranteed  next day, or overnight gets there on as advertised.

 Go talk a trip to the PO and ask some questions of your PO
 personel---talk to your postmaster---set the record straight .
