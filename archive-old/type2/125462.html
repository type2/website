Subject: steering wheel

If someone had or is having the same problem but knows how to fix or where to
fix:

T2 from 1968:
The steering wheel turns to each side at least 10 degrees (maybe even more)
before the wheels really start to turn....i think this is due to so many
kilometers with two adults plus the spare tire and it's steel mount and
sometimes one child in one chair between the front seats. So much wheight over
the front axle turned all the &quot;turning system&quot; lose....
Does anyone knows where the problem is? Can it be fixed or do I need to get
some new parts?

Thanks again to you all....
from Lisbon, PORTUGAL
Joao Nuno Ribeiro
