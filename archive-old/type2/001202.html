Subject: 1974 VW Safari engine questions
Date: Sun, 15 Oct 2000 17:30:50 -0400
	charset=&quot;Windows-1252&quot;

My father-in-law has a 1974 VW Safari Camper Van and it has a blown motor.
I am not even sure what motor it has in it.  Could someone tell me?
Anyways he was talking to a mechanic that supposedly knows VW's and he told
him to put a 1600 Dual Port engine in it rather than rebuilding the old one.
So my question is what VW's have this motor in it and does anyone know where
one can be found?
Also is a 1600 going to have enough power to pull a camper van?
Any insight would be greatly appreciated as I know nothing about these
vehicles except that the motor is real easy to take out.

Thanks for your time
