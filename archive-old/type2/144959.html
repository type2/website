Subject: Re: [T2] New Mr Heater portable buddy says NO inside use.

I got mine from the USA so no warnings were crossed
out.  You're right, it's a Canadian CSA thing and the
company would pay a heavy ransom to have it CSA
approved.

Did you get it at the sale price or $129?  

Let me know how you like it.  The pilot light had me
freaked at first then I started thinking about it as a
mini mini fireplace.

&gt; Different owners manual. The webpage of Mr. Heater,
&gt; clearly states it is ok
&gt; to use indoors. Typical Canadian baloney.
