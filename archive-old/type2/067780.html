&gt; Does anyone know what would be required to swap a fuel injected motor into
&gt; a '74 bus?  

I am currently the owner (and occasionally the driver) of a 1973 Westfalia
with a 1978 fuel injected motor and 1979 Transaxle.  The installation is
not physically difficult, but I recommend this only if you are starting
with two complete busses.  I started with a '79 running rustbucket that I
had driven back from Florida to Virginia.  The car contained the engine
from my beautiful '78 that I had wrecked in Florida (long sad story
skipped here).  In search of a good body I found a '73 Westy with no
engine or transmission and bought it cheap.  

In addition to the engine and transmission I also had to transfer the rear
main wiring harness, the gas tank, the gas tank cover, the air cleaner
support (and I wanna talk to the people who just posted about &quot;drilling
out the tack welds&quot;, that was a major grinder job on the '79, big fillets
of weld up both sides), and a couple of other miscellaneous bits.  I did
not, but should have, switched shifter rods, as the trannies are different
lengths and I still have a funky shift pattern (see below).


&gt; I already have converted to an electric fuel pump, so putting
&gt; in a higher pressure pump isn't going to be a problem, but what else is
&gt; involved?

First, your electric fuel pump for a carb engine is junk for FI.  It puts
out ~10-14 psi, FI requires 30psi. You will need to get and rig an
installation point for an FI fuel pump.  You will also need to:

carve an air cleaner bracket from a '75-&gt; bus and mount it in yours, 
open up the FI brain cutout above the battery,
transfer (drill out welds) the upper brain bracket on a '75-&gt;
drill 2 extra holes in your firewall to pass new wires.
transfer the rear wiring harnes from the '75-&gt; donor, or rig FI and fuel
pump connections onto your present harness;
switch gas tanks and cover plates (a great time to replace the guage
sender :-),
rig a mount for the blower fan above the engine (necessary, as it is a
major electrical junction point),
find a way to mount the charcoal canister,
and a bunch of minor stuff.

&gt; I understand there is some kind of electronic equipment on the fuel
&gt; injected buses, is this difficult to wire into a bus originally equipped
&gt; with a carb?  

The electrical connections turned out to be a bit easier tha I expected,
but then, I did a wiring harness swap and I had a full-color wiring
diagram in my ol' Bentley (DAMN BENTLEY! for going to b/w wiring diagrams
in newer editions)

&gt; I'd like to put in a motor, maybe a 2.0 from a later model
&gt; bus.  My carbs are dying, and I just like FI better anyway.

While the process was not especially difficult, and I would do it again
under similar circumstances, I would highly recommend that if you decide
to do this that you have a fairly complete '75-&gt; parts bus standing by to
donate bits.

One area where I screwed up was the tranny.  There is a definite
difference in flywheel diameter, bell housing depth, starter length,
overall tranny length and therefore shift rod length between early and
late breadloaf busses.  I don't know what the ideal mix-n-match between
generations is, but I know I am unhappy with mine (late engine, late
tranny, early body).  *IF POSSIBLE* (and I ain't tried this), I would
probably go with late engine, early flywheel and early tranny next time. 
Let me know what you decide and if you want an *extemely* long post on
what I remember of the procedure.
