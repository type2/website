Subject: Re: sand blasting/paint prep &amp; walnut media???

Hi ctonline_at_webtv_dot_net

On 12/06/03, you wrote:

&gt; So What are you trying say here Wil--- Because you messed around
&gt; with ceramics--your no longer going to Use a Mask--Or What??

I know I've got some accumulated silica already even using safety
equipment.

&gt; Or because your folks smoked your not going to wear a mask--I don't
&gt; have an iota of an idea where your going with this-- Buy a high end
&gt; mask and use it--period.

Not at all.....I use a mask no matter what I'm doing.....dust, vapor,
various kinds for various purposes.  What I'm saying is that safety
equipment limits exposure but doesn't eliminate it.

What the mask won't help with is the silica media that gets scattered
around my driveway and property...a quarter acre or so in an older 
development of houses (tracked into the house, kicked up when I mow the
lawn or dig in the flower beds).  Sometimes I feel its worth it to use
a less effective process depending on other potential issues.

An organic media will simply degrade...if it
blows around its less of a hazard.  Sure the silica media will wash/blow
away eventually but stuff tends to hang around the area it was used
for a while.  

&gt; Now--lets get to the definition of late model vehicles-

&gt; Your 80 Vanagon does not fit into this catagory--
&gt; Sand Blast it---get it over with--and paint it--

&gt; It isn't any way, shape, or form into the new millenum toilet paper
&gt; sheet metal syndrome--

&gt; It's not a 32 Ford--but it is plenty blastable--

Thanks...I thought that's what you meant.


Sincerely,
--
