Subject: The Rescuers

Just when I thought we were getting down to one or two VWs, Dad goes out 
a buys three more.  This time it was a '67 Beetle with no motor and a 
rusty pan, but a good title, body, all the glass, radio, etc.  Next was a 
'62 Sunroof Beetle (Baja) complete with motor, title, good glass, radio, 
original tails/turns.  The best find was a '61 15-Window Deluxe Bus, 
front end damage, cracked rear window, cracked stationary side window, 
missing a little trim.  It does have the corner windows, jail bars, 
radio, complete interior, and motor, but no title.  These will probably 
all end up as parts vehicles.  Purchase price ... $50 each.

The seller had been collecting VWs and Corvairs for quite a while and was 
liquidating his stash.  Dad missed out on the three Ghias, but is 
contemplating a '65 Corvair with *no* rust for $300.  I have no 
experience with these creatures, but I do like the body style of the later 
models.  There are still a couple of Greenbriar vans out in the field, but 
I'm not too crazy about the looks of these.

My '60 Double-Door Panel was finally rescued from restoration limbo this 
weekend by its new owner who drove from Cincinnati (sp?), Ohio to 
Springfield, Missouri in one day.  Gotta admire the dedication of a new 
Bus owner.  I'm sure it's in good hands and will be on the road soon.

Keep looking.  They *are* out there ...
