Volks...
  Thank you for your insight into my tyre purchase. I found a great deal on 4 185r14's at Tire Pro's here in SoCal. Most places didn't know what I was talking about, and the ones that did were charging close to $400.00!!!
  Tire Pros is awesome, check 'em out next time you buy!


Peace &amp; Harmony
