Subject: KYB Home Gym and Shock Bolts

New KYB Gas-A-Just shocks came today in my $400 box of goodies.

&lt;ACTUAL QUESTION&gt;:
Should the shock bolts be a higher grade than the &quot;Home Depot Bolt Bin&quot;
bolts?  Like a grade 5 or whatever?  My bus was missing back shocks and
bolts when I got it, and the ones that were shipped with my shocks (I
requested them) are too short.
&lt;/ACTUAL QUESTION&gt;

&lt;LATE NIGHT FRUSTRATION INSPIRED RAMBLING&gt;
BTW, if you forget to put the bolt in the lower shock hole before cutting
the strap - You will not have time to get the bolt in the shock by the time
it passes the hole. :-)   Then remember to put the bolt in and push the
shock up (Boy, those are stout).  You'll make it in the hole this time only
to find that the bolt is too short (swear some more).  Push the shock up
again enough to pull the bolt out (Wow, those ARE stout) and swear some
more at the bozo that shipped you a bolt that is too short.  Then swear at
the DPO for leaving the shocks who knows where.  Then swear at yourself for
finding a tear in another CV boot that you did not know about before you
were lying in such a great position under your Bus, then kick yourself for
not looking better the first time before you JUST ordered the ONE that was
obviously torn...Maybe they accidentally double shipped that boot. :-)

On the bright side, based on the force required to compress those shocks, I
was afraid the back of the camper was going to shoot into the air when I
got them on. :-)   They should do well.  I hear good things about them.  I
think it will make the 'ole Westy ride well.  If I can get the motor back
in that is.
&lt;/LATE NIGHT FRUSTRATION INSPIRED RAMBLING&gt;
