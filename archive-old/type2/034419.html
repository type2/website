&gt;I'm installing new valves in a set of new heads. I Ordered the valves,
&gt;etc. from MOFOCO. I also asked them to send me a set of valve stem
&gt;seals. They said that these are not needed. Is this so? Won't I be
&gt;burning the oil that leaks down along the stem? If I do need them are
&gt;they included in the standard engine gasket kit?

Let me start with a bit of background noise.

When your valve stems and guides become worn, opening the intake valve
will cause some oil vapor to drawn into the combustion chamber from the
valve gallery via the worn guide. When the exhaust valve opens some com-
bustion products will be blown INTO the valve gallery. Stem seals reduce
this process but can not prevent it entirely. (noise off)

Valve stem seals are not included in the standard VW engine overhaul gas-
ket set.

The purpose of a valve stem seal is to close off the valve guide when the
valve spring is compressed. The seal normally rides on the valve stem just
beneath the keepers, comes in contact with the head of the valve guide
when the valve is open.

The Catch-22 about stem seals is that they are of little value when the guides
and valves are new but are very useful in preventing excess oil burning and
exhaust blow-by when the guides become worn. The catch is, it's impracti-
cal to tear down a worn head just to install stem seals. Since you have to
tear down the head, you may as well rebuild the head.

The answer is that most mechanics, the good ones anyway, install the seals
when they rebuild the heads. For the first twenty thousand miles they prob-
ably do little good but neither do they do any harm. And between twenty and
forty thousand miles, about the maximum safe life for a VW exhaust valve,
they do a great deal of good.

All real auto-parts stores carry stem seals and 7mm is a standard size,
although some provincial parts clerks may not know that. Take a valve with
you, make sure the seal is a snug fit.
