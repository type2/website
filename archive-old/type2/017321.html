&gt; &gt;I disagree. Stick with the 009 its a superior distributor. You don't want to
&gt; &gt;have to rely on a vacum advance distributor.
&gt; &gt;They're ancient.
&gt; 
&gt; And the 009 is &quot;space-age&quot; technology?  This cracks me up!  You realize
&gt; that the 009 was first used on the 1959 &amp; earlier 36hp buses don't you?
&gt; 
&gt; Carb &amp; distributor technologies should be matched together - they were
&gt; designed to work together as a unit.  The 34 PICT 3 carb was designed to
&gt; use a vacuum advance distributor and will give a smooth throttle response
&gt; throughout the rpm range when they are used together.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;When using an 009 with a 34.3 there will be a dead stop upon
&gt; &gt;shift up through the gears.
&gt; &gt;Learn how to drive it best to eliminate that - overlap the clutch with the
&gt; &gt;gas pedal a bit more and it will go smoother.
&gt; 
&gt; This arguement is ridiculous at best...

Dave: 
Exactly right! 009, 010,&amp; 050 are all OLD Bosch numbers. Hot VW's and
their crony advertisers really love to push these things because they
must appeal to many peoples' imaginations and they figure they can
handle something as easy as a distributor change. In all the vehicles
I've had I tried 009's and NEVER found one that didn't perform better
with the stock distributor! I think they are mostly good for the people
that sell them.
I do think they'd work just fine with dual IDF Webers or DLRA
Dellorto's, however. I do know as well that 356 Porsche experts
recommend the 050 over the 009, I think it may have less total degrees
of advance.
I'd even drill a hole in the side of a Weber IDF if it didn't have the
right vacuum ports just to see if a vac advance carb might not work
better!
