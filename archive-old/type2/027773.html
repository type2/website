Subject: FS Drive away tent

Drive away tent -  Basic Orange and Blue, I guess.
For Bay Window Bus or camper

Again, I never looked at it, just the poles (easier, and I wanted to see if 
they were all there).  If I can get the '94 Nissan 240SX convertible out of 
the garage, I might set it up there, or on Saturday morning, back on my rear 
deck.

Was $225 yesterday - Thursday

Now $200  today - Friday

Barry Burneskis  703 440 0448  Springfield VA  (I answer the phone, not my 
e-mail - I will be hanging around Prince William Forest Park tomorrow, 
Saturday, and Manassas VA on Sunday - No, I am not taking the tent to the 
Manassas Bug Out!!)
