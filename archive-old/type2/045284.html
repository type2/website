There is a full length bench that replaces the 3/4 bench you have in there
now. The last seat next to the door has a folder down back to make enter to
the rear most seat easier. They seem to be fairly rare.

It is possible to put curtains in the passenger bus. I don't know if I'll do
that to mine but I've seen plenty of them with curtains.
