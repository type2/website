I pulled the engine from my '81 calif vanagon yesterday due to very low
compression in #1 and #3 (70 and 50 psi) by following Sean B's instructions
from the type2 library... very useful!!  Anyway, I've got the engine &amp;
transaxle sitting in my garage right now.  PO said that he had the heads
done about 20k before he sold it to me (no receipt though).  I decided to
check the torque on the heads before completely removing them.  Several of
the bolts were undertorqued (10-15 ft lb).  Could this be the source of my
low compression (adding oil in the spark plug hole didn't affect
compression more than 5 psi)?  Also, if I retorque the heads can I check
compression without putting the engine back in (remember it is still
mounted to the transaxle)?  If so, do I just apply 12 V to the starter
solenoid, or do I need to hook up any other wires?  Would I need to have my
alternator installed to get an accurate reading?  Thanks for the help!
