&gt; The most recent set are Bosch. Have a place up here called Halsey Import
&gt; Automotive, they seem to be pretty good, they specialize in VW parts
&gt; &gt;
&gt;

          Do they have the right air seals and plug connectors tho? And, just
because they're new, doesn't mean one can't be bad. Are they real copper wire or
that fake stuff?


&gt;
&gt; Heh, yes, in fact I did at one point, have the wires messed up. I didn't
&gt; even bother mentioning it, I got it straightened out right away, in very
&gt; much the manner that you mentioned. This isn't nearly as extreme as that.
&gt; When the wires were on wrong, it would hardly go at all. This is just a
&gt; minor loss of power. When I brought her home, she'd zip up all but the
&gt; worst hills at 55-60. Now I'm lucky if I can get 45 up a small hill. I
&gt; can't drive her on the freeway, but we do fine around town. When I had #1
&gt; and #2 reversed, I couldn't get anywhere at all.
&gt;

       Sounds like you're maybe not firing on all cylinders tho. What happens when
you pull a wire one by one?


&gt;
&gt; So, what would happen if I had hydraulic lifters, and I'd adjusted them to
&gt; .006, because I didn't KNOW they were hydraulics?
&gt;

     You' d lose power,  a little bit, and they'd be pretty noisy, I'd think.


&gt; Really!? Wow, that's good to know! &lt;smile&gt; Uh, can I get a second opinion
&gt; on that? I was under the impression that the oil would start to degrade
&gt; over 230... &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt;

       Yup, that's what I've read -- but that's life in VW land. Or any other
air-cooled beast. Best to change oil often. Especially with Type 1 engines and no
oil filter.



&gt; &gt;      Nowhere do you mention doing a compression test -- after the overheating
&gt; &gt; and vacuum leaks, etc, you really need to do one --
&gt;
&gt; Compression test has happened twice. I don't have the figures in front of
&gt; me, but as I recall, #1 and #3 were 125# and #4 was 100#. This was
&gt; consistant between the first and second test. The first time, #2 tested a
&gt; little lower. The second time, we couldn't get the tester to screw into
&gt;

       Were these test before or after you ran without a fan belt. I saw one engine
after they ran it about 20 miles ( I think, it was long ago) and the valves were
toast. Plugs were burnt away quite a bit too --
