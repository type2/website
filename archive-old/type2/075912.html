Subject: RE: [T2] Canvas replacement on 1971 Westfalia

&gt; I am going to replace the canvas on a 1971 Westfalia. It seems like there
&gt; are several manufactures making replacements as well as a
&gt; replacement from Westfalia themselves.
&gt; Who makes the best replacement.


Actually there is only one major aftermarket manufacturer. Which means
you're going to get the identical canvas no matter where you buy it. So save
your money and go for the lowest priced vendor (which would be me).  Don't
forget to ask for your 5% listmember discount.
