To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I have no idea why it wouldn't work, but T4's aren't
my specialty. A friend of mine is doing a 73 x 93 type
4 motor for his bus, so similar things are apparently
possible. I don't know what he's had to do to make it
work, though.

&gt; Hey all,
&gt;   As some of you know I am working on a Cali
&gt; converted type 4 engine for my 71
&gt; Westy. The parts I have available to work with are
&gt; what I want to use. I have a
&gt; 2.0L Vanagon engine with a good crank and rods, but
&gt; even though the case is
&gt; perfect I can not use it due to the beather casting.
&gt; It has bad pistons and
&gt; cylinders and bad heads. I also have a good 1.8L.
&gt; The heads are good and so are
&gt; the P&amp;C's. I will be useing the case form this
&gt; motor(or one of my 1.7Ls) for
&gt; the build up. I would like to use the 2.0L crank and
&gt; rods with the 93mm Ps&amp;c's
&gt; from the 1.8L to make a 1929cc. Is this possible? I
&gt; figure I will have to lower
&gt; the compression ratio, but to what? This will be for
&gt; a Westy so I need the
&gt; torque of the longer crank. Any sugestions?
