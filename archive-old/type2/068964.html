Subject: A Different Starting Problem - Resolution

Got the bus fixed, finally.

The wire that went to the add-on starter relay broke off at the connector.
I tried to bypass the relay thingy altogether, but that didn't work.  

Unfortunately, I installed the relay in a place where I can't get to it
easily with the engine in, so all I could do (without pulling the engine)
was strip more wire, and wrap it tightly around the pole for the connector,
and make a promise I'll fix it next time the engine is out AND move the dang
relay to a more-accessible place.

Also, the hand-crank option looked real inviting today!  I have everything
in place except for the nut, of which I have 2 sitting on my workbench.  I'm
not married, so I own them both.
