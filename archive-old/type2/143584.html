Subject: Sensor on engine - What is it??

Ok this is probably going to be vague but I hope you can help me.  I've 
pulled the engine and tranny from my '78 sunroof bus (converted to a carb years 
ago) and I'm going to install it into a recently purchased '74 westy.  On the 
back of the egine (side closes to tranny) there are two sensors.  One is larger 
than the other.  the smaller one on the passangers side is connected to a  
connect to round plug??? What is this sensor for and where does it connect to.  I 
think it is originally part of the FI system, but I have no idea.....while i'm 
at it, where does the second sensor go as well??

Any info will help.

Thanks
Mike Q
