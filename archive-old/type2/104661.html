Subject: [VB] Scammer selling gas heaters


I would normally never do this publicly, but I don't
want anyone else to get screwed by this guy like I
did. I just wanted to give everybody here a head's up
about a fraud who's sellling SW gas heaters on Ebay.
He is selling under the ID wcbono_at_peoplepc_dot_com, his
name is William Bradford and he is in Minnesota. He
currently has a couple of heaters for auction right
now.
I paid him via PayPal for a working SW gas heater on
January 22. A month went by and I received nothing, no
emails or heater. So I get the guys phone number from
Ebay and call him, his wife says she is shippimng the
heater &quot;today&quot;. Well 2 more weeks go by and I still
receive nothing. So I call the guy again and his wife
says she put the wrong address on my heater and that
it has come back to them. However, that same day, the
guy himself emails me and says that the heater was
returned to him because the post office smelled gas. 
So the guys says he will refund my money. Another week
and a half goes by and I receive nothing, so I email
the guy and he says he sent me the payment via PayPal
last week. Guess what, there was NO payment sent to my
account. So it has now been 7 weeks, no heater, no
refund and the guy has the nerve to tell me that he's
getting pissed off that I keep bothering him.
So protect yourself, DO NOT SEND ANY MONEY TO WILLIAM
BRADFORD IN MINNESOTA, EBAY ID WCBONO_at_PEOPLEPC.COM.
Peace, John Baker
