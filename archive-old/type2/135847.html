Subject: Engine stand

I'm getting ready to invest in the 1000 lb. engine stand from Harbor 
Freight. According to the archives, the best way to use this is to 
mount the engine on &quot;an old bellhousing.&quot; I don't have &quot;an old 
bellhousing,&quot; and I've never seen &quot;an old bellhousing&quot; or any other 
part of a transmission at the bone yards. Lacking that, there are the 
$300+ yoke mounts available from the Porsche parts places. Don't think 
I'll spend $300+.

What modifications, if any, do I need to make to the stand as it comes 
from the store if I only use it to build the engine (but not add 
ancillaries or exhaust)? I would be happy if I could use it to build 
the bottom end, but happier still if it would take me all the way 
through bolting the heads on.

Also, it makes sense to me to bolt the j-tubes to the heads before 
bolting the heads on (assuming that I won't have the luxury of a stand 
from this point on). But I have never seen this as a recommended 
procedure. Any reason why not? Does it effect the head torque?
