Subject: MOFOCO

While we're on the subject of MOFOCO, I bought a rebuilt PICT 34 from them 
that absolutely refuses to idle on my 73 bug. The carb I took off 
(subsequently rebuilt by yours truly) runs OK, with the typical dead spot 
induced by a 009..but that's another thread. Anyone out there have any idea 
why a supposedly rebuilt card wouldn't idle on a Bug? BTW, I did send it 
back once. They claim to have checked it out on an engine and said it was 
OK.
