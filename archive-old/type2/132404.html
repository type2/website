Subject: 72 Vac advance cutoff switch

On my buddy's 72 bus I found the cutoff switch located at the top of the
engine compartment by the aux blower fan. I found a few references to it in
the archives after locating the description in Bentley:

http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/type2/112681.html
http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/type2/104220.html
http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/type2/081121.html

I'm still left with the a few questions that need answers:

1) Is it worthwhile to hook up? It seem like there is no advance unless it's
very cold or you are in 4th gear. How's drivability?

2) Where is the temperature switch located?

3) Is the 4th gear switch on the nosecone of the transmission?
