Hi, since it is Friday..A few years ago, my wife and I took our '74 Westy over
the Mountains to the West Coast of Vancouver Island, and I made sure she was
warm, with a complete Eider down bag.  She was content and warm.  Halfway
there, the snow got deeper and deeper, and temp had dropped.  When I came to
the first set of &quot;twistys&quot;, at the top of the pass, I went to lift my foot to
use the clutch, but my boot was frozen to the floor mat!  Had to pull over to
the side of the road, and &quot;rip&quot; the frozen carpet and boot apart!  After that
I tapped boots to any song that came on the radio, while wife chuckled from
the warmth of the down bag!  Made it my main future &quot;fix&quot;, and am still
working on it!
