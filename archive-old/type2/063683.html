Subject: I Did It!

Hey Everyone!

After my initial post asking for places to take my '70 bus for a valve
adjustment, I received some suggestions as well as some *pep talk*
(Sarah Gallagher and Dworkin!) that I could do it...so I did it!  Took
Muir in hand and spent the better part of today adjusting the valves,
changing oil, and cleaning air filter.  Overall went well...with the
major tricky point for me being the turning of the engine for each
valve.  There were paint marks on the belt wheel already so I used them,
but occasionally had to adjust slightly.

Mostly it was tedious (but not too difficult) adjusting the valves...so
as the saying goes &quot;do it yourself and you know it's done right&quot; - well
since it was my first, I can say that I know it's done, and I'm *pretty
sure* it's done right :-)

One question regarding the oil change.  The Muir book talks about an oil
screen but when I took off the plate - no screen, only two gaskets
(which I replaced).  
Should there be a screen in there?  It's a fairly new rebuilt (8K
miles)...so I don't think it was overlooked..?

Thanks for all the suggestions and encouragement!
