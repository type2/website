Subject: body work?

Well, if I don't get replies I'll check the archives, but I figured with
this community there would be plenty of people who'd love to throw
suggestions, advice, and ideas out, and possibly even get into &quot;discussions&quot;
over the finer details of what grit sandpaper to use between paint coats and
so on...

I've got some various bodywork things to do on Lucy my 75 camper. I'm going
to put together a website with pictures and probably post to the list from
time to time with updates on the work. I've never done bodywork before, and
have absolutely no clue what I'm getting into. But, I've done several engine
rebuilds and such and figure I should learn the next thing.

So my first question then: any suggestions on a book or website that will
introduce me to the field of pulling dents, grinding metal, replacing rusty
bits and sections, and ultimately painting?

Thanks!

Bill Martin
Lucy - 75 camper
