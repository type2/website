&gt; I saw a list for a close-to-vintage westy bus with a stool.  What is
&gt; this stool?  Does anyone have a picture/description of use? 

The one in my nearly original '69 Westy is a four legged stool that is
upolstered identically to the back seat. It is at the same level as
the seat, so it makes a great ottoman for the back seat passengers. It
has a little leather strap that attaches to the sink cabinet so that
it doesn't fly around while you're driving.
