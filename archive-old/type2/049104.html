&gt; Listies I've got a 71 Westy that I'm using for a
&gt; daily driver.  The paneling
&gt; is in pretty sorry shape both in fit and condition
&gt; (originals were replaced
&gt; by PO). I would like to be able to create the
&gt; interior panels without using
&gt; the old one as templates.  Does anyone know of a
&gt; place where I can get a set
&gt; of templates?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for the help, Paul

&gt; Paul,  If you live in or near Va. you are in luck
because Mid-Atlantic VW parts and restorations just
happens to manufacture replacement panel sets precut
to fit,unfinished or finished. (804)732-7327 for more
info or e-mail me     Thanks Wayne
