Subject: breadloaf with discs

Hey, everybody!  I just signed on to the list, and I have a few tech
questions that I know somebody will be able to answer (you Volkswagen
smarty-pantses you):

Putting discs up front on my '59 Panel is pretty straightforward from what I
understand: post-'73 spindles and whatnot.  Are there any 'secrets' I should
know when buying or fitting the parts?  Should I fit a servo too (which
means the whole later front beam I guess) or are unassisted disc brakes good
enough for a work truck in a hilly part of the country? (I generally carry
500-700 lbs of mussels in the back, and I don't want them to be 'endangered'
by duff brakes. har har) Does a disc conversion automatically mean changing
the system to dual-circuit?  How much should I expect to pay for this stuff?

Thanks in advance.  This list makes for great reading!
