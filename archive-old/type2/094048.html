Subject: fuel line replacement - won't start!

list, for my fuel line job I did the following:

changed all fuel lines

new filter

pulled all injectors, used one new smaller seal on #3 as I lost the original (borg-warner)

pulled 3/4 intake runner (had to fix sheared stud)

disconnect main f.i. plug (gently to get to fuel ring)

disconnected airbox &amp; wiring (above)

everything is back in it's correct place. cranks but won't start.

going out now to get a fuel pressure gauge to test my work properly, starting with the pump.

can anybody throw out some advice, places to start?

thanks,

Billy
