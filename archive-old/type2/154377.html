-----I apologize for the non VW content, and the fact it is not &quot;Free load
Friday&quot;, but being a &quot;gearhead&quot;, irrelevant of brand, this is like &quot;ballet&quot; to
me, and I merely wished to share it with other &quot;gearheads&quot;!  &quot;shields up!!!&quot;

       There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is
a

       miracle. The other is as though everything is.

                  Albert Einstein



       Read the info first, then watch the clip....link below.



       And you thought those people that set up roomfuls of dominos

       to knock over were amazing. There are no computer graphics or

       digital tricks in the film linked below.  Everything you see

       really happened in real time exactly as you see it.



       The film took 606 takes. On the first 605 takes, something, usually
very

       minor, didn't work. They would then have to set the whole thing up
again.




       The film cost six million dollars and took three months to complete

       including full engineering of the sequence. In addition, it's two
minutes long so every time Honda airs the  film on British television, they're
shelling out enough dough to keep any one of us in clover for a lifetime.



       However, it is fast becoming the most downloaded advertisement in
Internet history.Honda executives figure the ad will soon pay for itself
simply in &quot;free viewings&quot;

       (Honda isn't paying a dime to have you watch this commercial!).



      There are six and only six hand-made Honda Accords in the world.To the

       horror of Honda  engineers, the filmmakers disassembled two of them to
make the film.

       Everything you see in the film (aside from the walls, floor,  ramp,
and

       complete Honda Accord)  is parts from those two cars.



       Oh, and about those funky windshield wipers. On the new Accords, the
wind

       shield wipers have  water sensors and are designed to start doing their
thing automatically as soon as they become wet.
