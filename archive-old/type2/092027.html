Subject: Re: [T2] Now I've Heard It All!

I vow to get to the bottom of this. I will have my partner call the Aunt
and Uncle this week and get the real scoop. Fact or fiction. Inquiring
minds want to know!

&gt; &gt; it and stuff.  Here's the kicker and she swears it's true. It had a
&gt; &gt; WATERBED in the back!
&gt;
&gt; Possible but dubious. =^ ) Assuming a 54&quot; x 75&quot; waterbed (a standard
&gt; double-size mattress, quite small for two people if they are pitching
&gt; about together but let's go with it) twelve inches deep, that's 48,600
&gt; cubic inches of water. At .036 pounds per cubic inch, that's right at
&gt; 1750 pounds. Let's add 300 lbs for two fairly light occupants.
&gt;
&gt; Assuming no other gear in the truck, 2050 lbs is not beyond the carrying
&gt; ability of a splitty, but it's at the limit of safety and definitely
&gt; pushing the limit of comfort. Stopping would be an ordeal. Stopping on
&gt; short notice would be impossible. Stopping in San Francisco would have a
&gt; VERY high pucker factor. It's very unlikely anybody would drive around
&gt; like this for long and survive to tell about it.
&gt;
&gt; This leaves aside the unpleasant prospect of an unheated water bed in
&gt; the first place.
&gt;
&gt; But it's a fun story anyway. =^ )
