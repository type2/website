Subject: Re: [T2] Starting problems in the DEATH BUS





&gt; Similiar thing going on with my bus. Next time it won't start trying
putting
&gt; it in third gear and pusing back on it.
&gt;
&gt; If that helps it means that the starter is getting hung on the freewheel,
i
&gt; haven't fixed the problem yet but I know that sometimes some bolts on the
&gt; starter have to be tightened per the Muir book.

I have been under the Bus with my wife turning the key and pressing the
button and I can't even hear the Selenoid engage.
