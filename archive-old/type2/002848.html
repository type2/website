&gt; While doing this I found
&gt;out I screwed something up with the distributor or &gt;distributor driveshaft
&gt;installation, because now when the distributor is oriented like it's
&gt;supposed to be on the engine, the notch in the rim is where #2 is when the
&gt;timing mark is lined up with the seam in the crankcase.  D'OH!  Well I just
&gt;switched around the plug wires and have not thought much about it.  Anyone
&gt;know what I did wrong?


If you find out let me know :)  BTW thanks for all the help Sean.
