Subject: Re: [T2] 1968 Bus

Hi David,

No this is not normal behaviour, you should be able to drive your bus as so=
on as the engine is on.
There are two things which immediatly come to mind.
Firstly the choke. with the engine cold pull the throttle arm on the side o=
f the carb back and the steped cam against which the top end of the throttl=
e arm rests should rotate (top of cam comes towards you) so that when you l=
et go of the arm it no rest on the top step insted of the bottom step. If t=
he cam does not rotate then either the choke is broken or its not hooked up=
 correctly. The choke spring is on the right side of the carb behind a smal=
l plate secured by 3 screws and with an electrical connector. Removing the =
plate will show you if the spring is broken, and will enable you to operate=
 the choke flap from that side. If its not broken then hook it back on and =
as you replace the choke turn it so that the stepped cam is in the 'down'po=
sition with the throttle arm pulled back.
As the engine runs the spring is heated electricaly and the choke flap and =
stpped cam returns to the up position. Therefore to engage the choke before=
 starting the engine press the throttle pedal once to allow the cam to rota=
te.=20

Secondly you may have a vacume leak. With the engine running spray WD40 (or=
 similar - see archives for extensive disscussions) around the joints betwe=
en carb and input manifold and maifold and head. (If you have a dual port e=
ngine - not standard for year - then there will be joints in the input mani=
fold too, so spray there as well) A vacuume leak will show itself by a chan=
ge in the engine note as the WD40 is sucked in. As the engine seems to idle=
 but not pull it may be necessary to do this test while pulling back the th=
rottle arm on the carb to increase the vacuume in the manifold simulating d=
riving conditions.

Good luck

&gt;=20
&gt; Hello all,
&gt;=20
&gt; I am new to the whole Volkswagen experience, and I just purchased a 1968 =
Bus
&gt; for $1500.  The engine seemed kind of worn out, and we couldn't=92t get
&gt; adequate
&gt; power.  Tried to adjust the timing to no avail.  The guy I bought it from=
 is
&gt; really into VWs, and so we switched the engine out for one he knew ran we=
ll.
&gt; Now it runs really nicely, but only after warming up quite a bit (20=20
&gt; minutes).  If I try to drive it sooner, it will practically stall and it
&gt; goes nowhere fast.  Is this normal?  What can I do to help this warm-up
&gt; process?  Thanks in advance,
&gt;=20
&gt; Dave
