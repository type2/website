&gt;         If you couldn't get the pushrod out when you installed the new pump it
&gt; probably means that the end of the push rod has 'mushroomed' as it has worn.
&gt; This also means that your pushrod is worn and too short so that could very
&gt; well be the source of all your problems.  You probably (I think...) received
&gt; a new pushrod with the new pump.  You will have to install that one to get
&gt; it to work properly.
&gt;So now your problem is getting the old pushrod out.  This is a real bugger
&gt; and I'm not sure how to do it without gobs of work. 

This sounds like an upright, right?  (non-electric fuel pump).

Just pull the whole bakelite assembly out of the engine.  That sortof
1/2&quot; high part that is under the fuel pump will come off if you pull
straight up, and the whole shebang should lift out.  You can then take
the pushrod out from the bottom of the &quot;stand&quot;.  A new stand is not
expensive, but gettting a broken one out may require some ingenuity
(SP?).  A new pushrod probably didn't come with the pump, make sure you
have the right length, there are two different ones, one is for
alternator pumps, the other for the generator version.
