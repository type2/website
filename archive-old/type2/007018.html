Hey all, a story to pass the time...

ok, so the summer after i graduated undergrad, i decided that i need
to get away for a little bit before starting the tortuous life of a
grad student. so i figured i would go hiking in the smoky mountains by
myself for a month and find my head, get a true perspective,  open my
spirit to the world and cleanse myself. that sort of thing. anyway i
am having the time of my life, there had been a lot of rain early that
spring so there were millions and gazillions of berries and wild
flowers to eat, smell, gaze, ponder, etc. i saw bear, wild boars,
deer, rabbits, and thankfully very few people. now the good part. as i
said there were a lot of wild flowers and hence a bazillion flying
insects feasting on the bounty. i was hiking along up somewhere on a
ridge and there are so many flying friends that they are constantly
flying into me and bouncing off. BINK DINK POP, off my head, arms,
back, tummy, tush, etc. this is fine, i am hiking along, my head in
the clouds when all of sudden POW, this crazy moth just happens to
collide with my ear, in just the right spot at just the right angle,
at just the right speed, to get sort of lodged in the opening of my
ear. WHOA! so being the calm and patient person that i am, i freak out
and try and grab him, let's call him bernie what the hell. this only
freaks the little guy out, so he starts squirming and tries to get
away from my fingers. unfortunately the only place he can squirm to is
deeper in my ear. so before long i can't even touch him! but by golly
i can feel him. now i don't know what was going on in little bernie's
head, but obviously he didn't like where he was, because he just keeps
squirming and trying to flutter his wings. now let me tell you, the
Chinese may have thought they were pretty clever with that with that
water trick, but having a live and frightened bug inside your ear is
enough to drive anyone CRAZY!!! so i am still being calm, by now i
have thrown off my pack and have been banging at the side of my head
trying to shake bernie out like he is water or something!

WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT?????

TUNE IN SOON FOR THE EXCITING CONCLUSION...
