        Dear listers,

        A few months ago i swapped my engine and now it's running after the
rebuild and i'll have to set up the electrical conections of the alternator.
My engine is a 2.0 ltr pancake engine and it seems to be an 411 porsche or
something. Well at least i guess so cause after messureing the crankcase and
the crankcase bearings i found out that they have exactly the same sizes
like the ones of the 914 porsche, 411 engine. Well the problem is that i
have to big wires coming out of the alternator. One is the big red one that
goes to the starter solenoid and the other one is just a hose that has 4
cables in it. Three of the these cables (red, brown and green) end into a
black plug with T shape also there's coming a short blue cable out of the
black plug that has a transparent plug at the end. There's one black cable
left that has a transparent plug too, but it's not conected to the black
plug. Where do i have to conect all of these cables? Which one is the cable
that goes to the control light in the dash?
        Thanxs beforhand for your help guy's...

        Michel
