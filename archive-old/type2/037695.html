Subject: Brake warning light wierdness.

          I took the bus  to work this morning after an all night rain/wet
snow.
Noticed that when i put the bus in reverse the brake warning light came on!
After poping outta rever. into first it went out .
Next noticed that selecting left hand signal that the brake warning light
would flash in unison with the signals!
Tried right hand signals and it worked fine.

Does anyone think this may be rear tail/brake lights getting moisture in
them?
Just got home and it's dark so will have to drive the Chr*sler tommorrow.
Any other thoughts? I pushed on the relays on the fuse panel as i was
driving thinking there may be a prob
there but no change.

Could anyone give me some suggestions as to where to start troubleshooting
this snag?

Thanks Alot
