&gt; hey i have a question about my windshield wiper fluid. its not working, its 
&gt; filled up, and i see a tube there, with a litttle nozzle thing at the end. it 
&gt; looks like it needs to take some air. does anybody know what i have to do?

put some air in it, it is an air presure system, I personally would start
with very little air from a hand pump, that way if it leaks less mess, it
should have on the tank the max presure.
