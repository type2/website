&gt; Subject: 69 split for sale upstate south carolin
&gt;
&gt; my boss came in this morning after seeing my bus in the parking lot and says that he seen another bus yesterday for sale..
&gt; i asked about it but he didnt know if it was a split or bay or year or condition just seen it ,,,
&gt; i called them and they said that it is a
&gt; 69 split with a 914 flathead engine in it...

Wow, and we thought '72 single/double cabs were rare! Lets see now...split windows ended in '67 and the Type 4 (914) engine came out in '70 in the
cars. Must be a pre-production model that has both early design (because customers complained that they didn't like the new bay window styling) and
the new engine configuration that was being developed for the next generation.
