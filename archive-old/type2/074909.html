Bob:
If it's holding torque, you might be okay. Like they say, hindsight is 20-20! It
was no doubt cracked previously, probably even before GEX got it. They should have
found it and TIGed it back to original. (Imagine that! They didn't find it!) Waht
a pitiful excuse for an engine rebuilder. The &quot;shotgun&quot; motor in my 80 westy is a
patched together GEX failure, too. I wonder how those guys sleep at nite!
The bigger lesson here for the list is to always check the strainer boss for
cracks/ deformation when the case is split. Maybe someone with more digital camera
savvy than me could give us a picture for the archives?

&gt;    I guess I know the answer but I have to ask...is there any way at all
&gt; to fix this without spliting the case????  this is a DAMN GEX case, last
&gt; remanant of the disaster I had with them years ago.....they are a curse.
