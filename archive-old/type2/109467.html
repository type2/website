Subject: Re: [T2] Rubber

Well,
In our harsh environment in Australia protecting rubber is a real issue. The
problem is what type of rubber you are trying to protect!
Unfortunately I'm no expert on the types of rubber compounds, so can only
share my experience.
I used to use Amoral (silicon based) type protectants on my Japanese motor
bikes, and on vinyl etc will excellent results. When I upgraded to European
bikes the Amoral would cause the rubber to perish very quickly, so I stopped
using it.
When I installed the new rubbers in my Kombi (mostly West coast metric) I
was recommended by a number of people to use Zymol, which I have not been
happy with as the rubber still looks dried out very soon after applying the
protectant, so again I have stopped using anything.
Cheers,
Richard
Brisbane Australia
