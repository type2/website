If you read the site, they show the costs of running it. About 1.50 Euros to
recharge the tank for another 2-300 km. That is cheap, compared to gas.

That would rock for puttering around town! Zero gas! WooHoo!

You guys forget the 2nd law of thermodynamics...there's no 
Free lunch... ?-( 
 
Zero gas??? How does that air get compressed if not by some 
Energy source? Hydroelectric...Natural gas...Newclear (wink, 
Wink)...Ethanol (BTW, corn's no free ride, either...Since a gal- 
Lon of ethanol already has a $.59 per gallon subsidy in addition 
To the petro-based fertilizer, insecticide, and farm machinery 
Used to grow it...)
