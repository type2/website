&gt; I still have ~30 of the original www.type2_dot_com window stickers. These are
&gt; dark blue ink on shiny silver Mylar and they are absolutely indestructible
&gt; and fade-proof. By convention they are placed on the lower left corner of
&gt; your rear window but of course you can do what you want. I have no
&gt; intention of ever printing another run of these.
 
&gt; We'll send one sticker to each of the first 30 contributors who send $5.00
&gt; or more to Steve. Enclose a mailing address.
 
&gt; Steve thinks we're flush but we need RAM, guys. Pony up. =^ ) &gt;&gt;

In the spirit of the season and just in time for Christmas shopping, the next 
11 Type 2 List Hats sold ($9.00 + $3.20 shipping per order)---the full $9 per 
hat will be donated for list finances.   

Hats can be seen at:

I appreciate and value every list member--both those I have met on this list 
and in person at VW shows.
