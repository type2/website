&gt; &gt; &gt; I have been running MXT without any problem for years.
&gt; &gt; I didn't have any problems with the Michelins I was using on my utility
&gt; &gt; trailer until one day the tread peeled halfway off with no warning.  Wiped
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I've heard of others having problems with sudden tread peeling on
&gt; &gt; Michelins too.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Considering the fragility of my VW fender wells, I won't be running
&gt; &gt; Michelin tires any time soon.
&gt; 
&gt; I have been running Michelins exclusively on all my cars including 20+
&gt; VW's over 30 years and the only time I had a tread peel was when I had
&gt; passenger car tires on a bus, and they lasted 45,000 miles or so...didn't

The thing that bothered me about the michelin is that it peeled completely
without warning.  No vibration, no nothing.  Suddenly
BANGBANGBANGBANGBANG!  I've had othe tires separate, but they gave plenty
of warning through vibration so I could replace them.
