&gt; hydraulic engine for my 1976 7 passenger van. I am stoked the engine runs
&gt; beautiful i couldnt't be happier the new question is my bus is saggin in the
&gt; rear it's been like that for 7 years does anyone have any tips of how i could
&gt; fix that problem my lolcal aircooled vw mechanic says 700-800 will fix the
&gt; problem.

the fix is to adjust the torsion bar, not hard but a PITA.
