Content-Disposition: inline

Hello all...
  Summer is upon us and it's getting hot. Does anyone have any suggestions for air conditioning in my 68 Bus? Are there any after-market products that utilize the bus' current ventilation system?
  It gets extremely hot here in the summer, 110 or better most days. Haven't got to Monterey yet, but I'm workin' on that ;0)

Peace &amp; Harmony
