Subject: Busted '73 bus (1 of 2)

This is an ALERT message.  Part 2 of 2 will be longish, and probably not
suitable for disinterested lurkers.

It is about a '73 bus that is broken down in Northern Virginia, and the
owner, David Karis, who is trying to deal with this, and life in
general, in the best way that he can. 

So, skip Part 2 of 2 unless you are local, or can provide some advice,
or can provide what he needs most, which is a visit by some people who
give a sh*t about another person.

(Sorry about the out burst.  I am a little upset.)
