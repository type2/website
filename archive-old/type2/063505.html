Subject: split winshield wiper

Has anyone ever put a late model windshield wiper (the one that is multi-speed and 
sideways oriented with the four spade lug connectors) in a earlier model (e.g. 1965) 
bus?

If so, did you use the associated switch for the wiper or can you rig it to work with 
the single speed switch?

TIA,

Steve B.
