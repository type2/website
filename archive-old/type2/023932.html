&gt; All,
&gt;  
&gt;  I need to change the anti-roll bar mountings on my bus (rusted through) and
&gt;  I was wondering if anyone has any hints they would like to share.  Haynes
&gt;  has about 2 sentences on the subject, I don't have Bentley, there is 
nothing
&gt;  in the type2_dot_com library and the archives aren't working properly.
&gt;  Is it easier with the wheels on the ground or not?  etc...

Hi Dave,

Yep Haynes is not very helpful; I spent hours trying to do this, until I 
learnt the trick....

The &quot;horseshoe&quot; (in cross-section) part of the clamp has to be squeezed 
together in order to 'slide' the other piece on.

To squeeze the ends together use two pairs of mole grips - use the first pair 
to squeeze the ends together a bit, then use the second pair to squeeze them 
together a bit more, remove the first pair and repeat untill the edges are 
sufficiently squeezed together to get the other part of the clamp on.

Note also the on the horseshoe part of the clamp the edges taper together so 
start to slide the other part on by putting its wide end on the narrowest end 
of the horseshoe shaped part.

Then 'slide' it on by hitting it with a hammer! As the sliding part reaches 
the molegrips apply the other set further down the clamp - again using them 
to pull the edges together a bit more

Once I knew how to do this I think it took me about 15 mins per side - no 
need to jack up the vehicle

If the above doesn't make sense send me a p-mail

Good luck and see you at Vanfest
