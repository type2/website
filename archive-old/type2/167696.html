Subject: Re: [T2] Perfection is welding - I'm nowhere close...

&gt; I was out last night doing a little zapping on Zoe, and as usual, my welds
&gt; look like crap. I know I have heard about the benefits of using a shielding

&gt; useful mainly for welding aluminum. I would certainly like to look at
&gt; something that is going to make the learning curve easier for me and if a
&gt; gas is the way to go, which is the correct one for MIG welding on steel?
&gt;
&gt; --
I use the &quot;MIG mix&quot;  of Argon and CO2   I am far from the good welder
but the gas shield makes it much easier to get a better weld.

besides, a good weldor is only as good as he is a grinder...;8*}

so I must be good, because I'm great with an angle grinder!!!
