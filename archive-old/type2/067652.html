Subject: Re: '61 23 window deluxe

&gt;I have a chance to buy a '61 23 windows bus and I was wondering if you
&gt;had any idea what one is worth.
&gt;
&gt;The engine was completely rebuilt about 1500 miles ago.
&gt;
&gt;The inside is completely gutted and the driver side and passenger
&gt;windows are missing.  The canvas sunroof is also missing.
&gt;
&gt;There is very minor rust throughout.
&gt;
&gt;If you could give me a ballpark figure as to what it is worth I would
&gt;appreciate it

I think I just replied off the list, but...

When you say the roof is missing, do you mean the canvas or the whole
shottin' match?  That assembly is hard to find, and $$$ when you do - prolly
~$500!!!

Why are all the windows missing?  How about the roof windows?  Corner windows? 

Is it a walk-through or bench?

The seats will run you some $$$$ too - the front seat will be ~100, middle
~300, and rear ~100.  Interior panels will runn ~250 for repros that are not
that great; a nice used interior will probably go for ~400-500.  Front mat
~50-$100 for a NICE one.  Roof glass will run you ~100-140;
since windows, popouts, ~10-~20 each with nice rubber; door windows ~25
each.  Corner windows ~75-100 a set.  It adds up fast.

Unless the rest of the bus is really clean, DRY, and straight, I would not
pay more than $1000 for it, and even then...

Also, check the floors, rocker area, battery compartment, belly pans, cargo
area, nose, etc for rust and straightness.  I'd rather have a straight dry
car with a rod thru the case than a screaming motor and a crappy body.
Motors are much easier to fix/replace than bodies.
