&gt; I've been told that Amsoil is better than most  other syn oils.
&gt; Any other opinions?

No, Sorry.  There are no other opinions :)

In fear that this will grow into an &quot;oil thread&quot;, which is second in
virulence only to a &quot;gun thread&quot;, I suggest that a search of the
archives might be useful.  Lots of opinions there!  You might also try
a Dejanews search using common synth-oil names.  This will yield
volumes of information.

Unfortunately, most information on this subject is based on hearsay,
one-data-point &quot;studies&quot;, sales men's hype, etc.  You have to dig
through a lot of chaff to find any wheat!

George Lyle, (Usin' whatever oil was cheapest and changing it often!)
