Subject: Re: [T2] Rim Color

I've known Harold Coker for some time.  He's the one who started  it.  His son Corky runs the vintage tire company. Harold still  runs his local tire shop, Coker Tire, and dabbles in local politics.    Harold is one of the biggest car collectors in the country. And  one of those guys who you'ld never know had money.  In fact, he's  a tightwad.  He really likes steam-powered cars  (locomotives).  When he couldn't find tires for some of his cars,  he started having them custom made.  Now they're the only real  vintage-car tire supplier.  So yes, they can be very expensive as  they are produced in such small quantities. Really only useful for  hard-core collectors.  Do we have any of those here?   Cheers...KR
  
All of their tires have always been really expensive.
