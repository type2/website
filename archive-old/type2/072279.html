Subject: 68-72 front bumper rubber

in hopes of taking the best components from three front bumpers and making
a perfect frankenstein i became curious before i removed one of the step up
rubbers. before i accidentally doink one of the holddown clips are there
any recommendations for taking them off/putting them on. the one being
transfered is on the dry side. any new thoughts on rubber conditioner.  -
