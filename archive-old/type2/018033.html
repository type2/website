OK, it's not the two screws at the bottom--it's the top that's giving me
a devil of a time. I can swing the firewall up like a garage door,but
the top is held fast by the metal lip above it. I can wink at my gas
tank, but I can't really do anything about the broken fuel sender.

How do I get the firewall OUT without deforming it...and how does it go
back in when done?
