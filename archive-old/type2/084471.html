Subject: Odometer Gear

My little plastic gear on my odometer broke and I had robbed one off a parts bus I have but it was no good. Does anybody know of a source for these gears. I have heard that there are brass one's avaliable that were used on earlier model vw's? Or does anyone have a used on that isn't cracked that they want to get rid of. My bus is a '76.  Thanks.
