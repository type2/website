&gt;If you want to glue metal to metal sections get FUSOR&lt;

Haven't found a local source for Fusor.  The local P*P boys has Versachem
and Permatex two part epoxy goo, appears to be the same idea.  Is it as
good?  Experience with it?

Also, it occurs to me that this stuff might be just the ticket to plug the
holes in my windshield lip.  Comment?  There's a zinc primer over the
sandblasted lip now, should I take it back down to shiney metal again before
doing an epoxy job?
