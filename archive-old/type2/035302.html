Subject: Side step cut out for propane-equipped Westies?

List:

Question: Are there two types of OEM side steps for 68-79 Westies??

Background:

I'm looking at acquiring an OEM side step for my '78 Westy.  I think I
might of just hit a snag. I think there might be a &quot;straight&quot; type of
side step (the long one that fits in the jack channels)for most applications.
and one with a cut out for Westies that have the propane tank (so you can
turn the knobs). I went down to visit my green Westy (which turned out to
not be there!) to check for a fuel pump.  I noticed a side step on a '75
Westy 
with a propane tank like my '78.  In looking at it more closely, I noticed
there was an indentation in the step rail, apparently for the knobs of the
propane tank.  I talked a bit to the owner and he said that only the Deluxe
(propane tank bearing) Westies came like this and that all the 
rest were straight across the rear edge.  I'll attempt a crude drawing:

&gt;&gt;        [------------------\  TANK     /----------------]
&gt;&gt;  STEP: [                   -----------                 ]
&gt;&gt;        [-----------------------------------------------]

The little indentation or cut-out for the knobs on the propane tank looks
like good factory welding. It looks like you might not be able to turn the
knobs at all without the cut-out...


As usual, thanks for any input and info,
