ok, use a test light not a meter, operate starter, light should flicker
WEAKLY.

IF you get the light check
. check presure in fuel ring
. check fuel pump operates

IF no flickering light
. check double relay, power out from center slot and vehicle ground, test
light should light, if no light check ground

if light here check wire between series resistance and double relay
terminal 88b, if it is ok, replace double relay

....
other things that could cause this problem but less likely
. break in wire between term 1 on distributor and term 1 on the ECU
. bad ign points
. condenser shorting to ground
. also check the connector off of teh intake air sensor, term 6&amp;9 200-400
ohm,  term 7&amp;8  120-200 ohms


&gt; spray!  when we disconnected the plugs at the injectors and put a meter on 
&gt; the plug... nothing.  tried this both ways with the key on and while cranking 
&gt; the engine over with the starter. nothing.  we are getting 12 volts up to the 

I'm assuming this is the injector plug not spark plug

&gt; series resistance block from terminal 88b of the double relay when the 
&gt; ignition is on.  we have continuity at the resistance block plug through each 
&gt; individual resistor.  all very equal.
&gt; about this point we ran out of light.  does any of this make sense to anyone 
&gt; or has anyone been down this same path before, and could give me the next 
&gt; possible step?

yes, one of the quirks of the fuel injection system is that you need a
test light rather than an VOM meter to check out most of the connections
(keep both handy, and download the VW fuel injection trouble shooting
manual from the archives)

&gt; this bus was running fine six months ago when he shut the key off.  the bus 
&gt; is a 77 camper with a 2.0 hyd engine.

it is most likely a loose connection somewhere, check em all

good luck 
Bob
