Subject: Seat Belts

Hello,
    I bought a pair of retractable seat belts from JC
Whitney for my 77 and have not been very happy with
them so far.  I thought I'd try to find the ones that
originally came with it, but a little bigger brand
new.  I have checked all of the catalogs including jc
whitney.  I can't seem to find the non retractable
seat belts for bucket seats.  Does anyone know of any
store that carries them?  Thanks a lot.

Peace,
Tim
