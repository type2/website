&gt;Hey again
&gt;     Anybody have a use for a Bosch GR17X generator? It supposedly 
&gt; fits buses
&gt;from midyear 69 thru 71. Here's the story- I ordered this unit for my 
&gt;bus
&gt;when my generator died. Had it half installed when we realized that it 
&gt;was
&gt;the wrong unit. (I have an early 69 bus, I ended up getting a GR15X)
=============================&gt;
I'm just guessing from memory, but aren't the 12 VDC generators the 
same except for amperage capacity and length.
The length can be accommodated by just using a different mounting 
plate, as I recall !?
Can somebody comment?
Again, I am going by what I think I remember, duh !
