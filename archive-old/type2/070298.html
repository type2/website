&gt; 
&gt; Per below, I'd check the serial number (VIN number) against published
&gt; listings to make sure it's really a '71. Doesn't sound like it. Post the
&gt; VIN number to the list or send it to me. I'll check tonight, or if you
&gt; post to the list, someone will probably tell you sooner....whether it
&gt; fits in the range of known VIN numbers for '71. You might also have a
&gt; European bus. What type of bunk do you have up top? a  cot? or a double
&gt; bed? Do you have a refrigerator, or a cooler? 
&gt; 
&gt; Welcome! Joe

Hi Joe,

Thanks for the reply.  Yours are postings that I have followed quite 
closely.

Let's see -- my wife has the bus right now (hard to get it away from 
her:-)) so I'll send the VIN later.  We have a pop-top that pops up at 
the rear (the luggage portion is at the rear of the bus).  We have a 
cot (a folding metal frame contraption with canvas on it) and we have 
a cooler behind the passenger seat.  There is a compartment above the 
cooler and a sink on top of the whole cabinet.  The cabinet has a little folding 
table next to the sliding door.  There is a rear-facing seat behind the 
driver's seat.  The forward-facing rear seat pulls out into a double 
(cozy) bed.  That's about it.

Were there busses with wrap-around, integral step bumpers and high 
mounted turn signals?  Or do you think someone changed the bumpers on 
this bus?

Wife just got home and I got the VIN -- silver tag on driver side 
door jamb says manufactured 08/70, 2312019045#.  There is another tag 
behind the passenger seat that has the same number on it and &quot;typ 
23-517&quot;.  There is yet another tag (painted white, same as interior) 
behind driver's seat with a whole bunch of things on it.  If important I'll send those 
numbers too.

Thanks much,
Les Lampman
