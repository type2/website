&gt;I'd like to build a spare type4 engine for my bus, but the one I have in it
&gt;is just fine so it may be up to 10 years before I need the next one.&gt;

&gt;Is it possible to build a new engine, but in building, prepare it for long
&gt;term storage?  Would lubriplate on the bearings and oil/STP on the
&gt;cylinder/pistons/rings be ready for pre-start oil pressure in 10 years?

&gt;I know there have been deals in the past on some VW of Canada engines on
the
&gt;list - I assume these have been sitting a while.  What do they do to keep
&gt;engines ready and fresh?

Ten years?  I can't see keeping an engine on the shelf for that long.  If
the crank, cam, or cylinders began to rust from simple condensation it could
cause pitting which would obviously be a bad thing.  Even if you oiled the
engine down to prevent this and turned it over by hand every few months it
would not be worth the hassle over 10 years.  I would be even more concerned
about the seals drying out and shrinking.  This just sounds like a bad idea.
The VW of Canada engines may has sat for a while, but I seriously doubt that
it was by choice.  Take the $1,000-$1,500 you would spending building the
spare engine yourself and put it in the bank.  Ten years from now, and
anytime between now and then, you'll have the spare grand to build an
engine.  Take care.
