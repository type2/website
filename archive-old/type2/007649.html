I removed the Westfalia luggage rack to wax the
paint under there and found some rust.  It is
limited to a few scratches on the roof panel and
two spots where the luggage rack attaches to the
trailing edge of the roof.

The rack is held to the roof using sheet metal
screws.  The screws pass through the fiberglass
and some tall rubber bushings.  The rust formed
between the rubber bushings and the steel roof.

The original bushings are brittle and scaly after
25 years in the weather.  Does anyone know where
to get replacement bushings for this application?   

The tie-downs and metal tube slats are horribly
rusted.  I think I could make new slats out of
electrical conduit pipe that is flattened at the
ends. But where to get replacement metal tie-downs?  

Thanks,
