Subject: RE: Free Vanagon kitchen--Need Pop Top seals in So Cal

Hey Volks,

Just the sink/stove/fridge unit, not the water tank section.  I pulled
it from my Vanagon and used it in the bay for awhile.  Fridge and stove
work, I think there is an issue with the faucet connecting to the supply
line.  It's been a few years and we never used the sink.  Anyway, we're
heading down I-15 through Vegas and then over toward Barstow and into
Claremont probably on Friday maybe Saturday.  If anyone can put it to
good use, meet us near the highway and it's yours.  I'll put it on the
truck last.

Getting the bus back on the road.  During the replacement of the poptop
canvas we are painting the poptop and replacing the seals...herein lies
the problem.  I could swear I already had the seals but, I sure can't
find them!  We're thinking we could find them along the way
easier/quicker than calling BD.  Anyone have any suggestions for picking
up the seals in Vegas or somewhere east of LA for a late bay?

TIA,
Bill
