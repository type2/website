You must have some problems with your tent as well.  The front luggage rack
is a seal, if it is not in place, wind and rain will come up into the tent
as you are driving down the road.  But if your tent is in good shape and
the window is closed, it should stop any drafts coming up under the seal.


&gt;Well... I finally make it to colorado springs late Monday night.  yes...
&gt;husband packed the computer for me to bring with me.  But I nearly froze
&gt;driving here, so I have a few questions.  I have installed the pop-top
&gt;seal, and the flat seal (that goes on top between the luggage rack and the
&gt;pop-top) but for some reason, it has a really big draft, just like having
&gt;the window open.  Is there any way to seal this so it will not freeze the
&gt;people in the back? How about the luggage rack seal?  I was told it was
&gt;not really a seal, but.. could it be causing this..... as I have not yet
&gt;replaced it. any help would be appreciated, as I may be taking my grandson
&gt;home with me and he would freeze.
&gt;thanks
