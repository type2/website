Hi,

EB03 was, in my humble opinion, a great success. Several folks 
pointed out that this years turn out was a bit lower than in the past 
and they are correct. The final semi-official count was 108 buses 
with about 5 additional buses coming out for a day visit. The effects 
of the early date, the war, and the Riot Act etc may have been 
contributing factors but quality is far more important than quantity 
anyway!

I want to thank a few key folks.
Richard Palmer for printing and selling shirts.
Great Potts for the logo, generous donations of door prizes, and for 
being an all around booster of the event.
Tootsie, Nissa, Emily, Cassady and the nice lady with the crew cab 
for helping with the door prizes.
T-bear for the cherries and the gold rose ceremony!
Mad Uncle Dave and all the judges of the chilli cook off.
And a BIG THANKS to Judy for cover the registration desk all weekend 
and all the door prize help.
If I forgot anybody I am sorry but I appreciate you anyway.

I will gather up links to trip reports and photos and post them to 
www.everybus_dot_com in a few days.

Thanks to all those that attended. I hope you had a great time and I 
look forward to seeing you next year.

Thanks
Chris
