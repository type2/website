Subject: Powder Coating

At a Home and Garden show today, there were a couple of powder coaters 
there pushing their work on lawn furniture and the such.

One guy had a wheel on display.

I asked him the price for a blast and powder coat job on a wheel, and he 
said $50.00.

I then asked about bringing in 12 at a whack, and he said &quot;around&quot; $40 each.

That in the realm of being high, middle range, low, what?
What have others been paying ?
