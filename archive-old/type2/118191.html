Subject: Temp Sender Q

I have acquired a VDO dipstick oil temp sender new in the box but 
with out instructions. My intention is to replace the sump mounted 
sender with the dipstick sender but I am a bit confused. The dipstick 
sender has two terminals on it -one of brass and one copper. I am not 
certain how to properly hook it up. Anybody have know which terminal 
goes to the gauge and what the other one is for?

Thanks
Chris
