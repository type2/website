Subject: Re: [T2] Westy Top Compatibility

I have one of each at my shop and would say you should be able to swap  them, 
but will double check. 
 
to make this an informative post, when you have the top off you should  paint 
it and if the tent section is bad replace it. I have done a few and  
understand the benifits.
