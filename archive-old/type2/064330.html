Subject: RE: Stainless Steel Heat Exchangers (Re: Torque those CVs!)

Ron hopes there might be stainless steel Porsche heaterboxes that would
fit an upright VW engine.  No such luck, I think.  356s have rectangular
exhaust ports and besides I *think* they all preceded the &quot;CleanAir&quot;
heaterbox concept (ie interior heat was from cylinders rather than ex-
haust pipes).  914 stainless heatexchangers would work on a Type4 bus
engine with the appropriate heads, EXCEPT that the exhaust would run
forward (front is, unfortunately, front) to where there isn't a muffler.

Buy new (VW) heaterboxes and have them Jet-Hotted is probably the best
bet.  Maybe use Thing J-tubes in the summer so that your heaterboxes can
spend part of each year in a cool, dry place.
