Subject: Another Westy Pricing Story

&gt;Reason being, I recently
&gt;purchased a 1970 Westy from the second owner with only 56K miles.  The
&gt;second owner bought it from the origianl owner in 1980 and stored it in a
&gt;warehouse from then until I bought it.

Ok. Now it's my turn.

I had heard that a guy at work had a 1969 Westy just sitting in his garage.
Now a little about Kaz. He is a meticulous person and an engineer, who does
strength calculations for satellite structures. I knew that if this guy had
an old car sitting around, it would be in great shape.

So my friend Al and I keep working on the guy. Every time we see him, &quot;So
how's that camper doing? You know I'd really be interested in looking at it
some time.&quot; You know, like that. This has been going on for years.

Well, a couple of months ago, Kaz calls me and says, &quot;Are you still
interested in my camper? I can't give it to you, but I'll let you buy it
for a dollar.&quot; My mind raced. &quot;Uh, er, can I come see it?&quot; He says that he
wants it gone by the weekend. I said, &quot;Ok. Sure. We'll come by tonight.&quot;

Now, I just got married six months ago, and my wife shares my eclectic
taste in vehicles, but it still quite a bit to just say &quot;Hi, honey, I just
bought another Volkswagen--but it was only a dollar&quot; without letting her
see it as well. It was really the first major thing we'd be buying together.

So we went over there with Al, of course, not knowing what kind of
condition this old bus would be in. As we drove up to the house, I saw it
in the garage. It was nearly perfect. This bus didn't look like it had ANY
miles on it, much less 82K. Sure, the curtains were faded and tattered, and
there were a few love taps from being a garage queen for so long, but other
than that, it certainly was pretty. And there was a big lump of vinyl
laying on the floor of the garage. &quot;What's that?&quot; I ask. &quot;It's the tent,&quot;
he said. The tent! A Westy tent!

We talked to Kaz while we waited for a flat bed tow truck to take it home.
He had warned us that the vehicle had not been driven for 3 years or so, so
the brakes might be dodgy. He told us how they'd had 6 kids, and took them
all camping in it, and that it was a lot of fun. But now that he didn't
have any kids, he wanted to put his other two cars in the garage.

Looking through the records (nearly complete, of course) I see that the bus
was originally picked up at the Hanover factory and driven around Europe
for a couple of months. Then it was shipped here to the bay area and sold,
and then in around '75 or so Kaz bought it, becoming the third owner.

Now, I had expected to pay a couple of grand for this vehicle, but never
thought I would get it for so little. I have put some money into it, but
when you add the costs for insurance, registration, a complete brake job,
new door lock, a tune up and changing all the fluids, it's still only up to
$800 or so.

Still if anyone wants to give me $10,500 for it, I'll think about it. But
I'll warn you, we like it a lot. We're calling it Cazbus. You know, like
&quot;Rock the Cazbus&quot;.
