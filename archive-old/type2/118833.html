It appears that the stock distributor on my '78 has given up- the shaft
wobbles- so I'm looking for a new one.  I'd really like a stock unit, but
haven't found one- everybody wants to sell me a 050.  Anybody have any
experience with the Mallorys sold by aircooled_dot_net?

Anybody got a good extra they want to part with?
Thanks
