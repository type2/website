Subject: Re: Building (trying) a hitch for my '71

I'm using a stock VWofA accessory hitch on my '71 and was a little
concerned that I would have problems with my new Berg exhaust but the
beauty of the stock hitch is its ability to be assembled on the Bus and I
ended up having no problem at all with the installation. I'll
take some pictures of the setup tonight.

&gt;
&gt; Glen,
&gt; I will share when I get it done.  Although I don't know how much help it will be because of my 1904cc and custom exhaust.  I have an
&gt; obstacle or two that I have to bypass.
