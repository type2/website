Subject: Re: [T2] Rehash piston/cylinders for sale

From: &quot;Casting Fool&quot; &lt;jester_at_cfnson_dot_com&gt;
&gt; Is anyone interested in those 2L pistons/cylinders that I have for sale?
&gt; Part number 029 198 075, in the original packaging.  It's a partial kit, 2
cylinders with pistons, a 94mm piston kit for a 2L.  The pistons are in
their original wrappings and have never been used.  There's also an open set
of seals and gaskets, a Victor Reinz gasket set for a 2L 914.

I've lowered the price to $140.00 plus shipping for the cylinders.  I'll be
posting this to the local club website and to the Samba later tonight.
