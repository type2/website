&gt;Well, we are ready to reassemble the engine for China Cat, the 75 Westy.
But, 
&gt;I have a problem. I'd like to get advice from an experienced engine
rebuilder.
&gt;
&gt;The engine is a 1800cc dual carb, but we have a single Weber conversion done 
&gt;by the PO. Further, this engine is a &quot;temporary beater&quot; as we have a 2L FI 
&gt;engine (bus originally had a 1.8L FI) which we are going to build from the 
&gt;ground up. I hope to have a perfectly usable engine in this 1800cc even if
it 
&gt;has to run 25K miles before we get the 2.0 ready.
&gt;
&gt;We have cc'd the combustion chambers and measured the deck volume and end up 
&gt;with 2.8cc max variation. Here is the way the individual cylinders work out, 
&gt;giving the variation, not the absolute compression volume.
&gt;1= +2.8cc
&gt;2= +0.4cc
&gt;3= +3.0cc
&gt;4= net
&gt;
&gt;I know that I could skim pistons and/or grind out the chambers, but I don't 
&gt;want to unbalance the chamber volumes in case I need to use these heads on 
&gt;the 2.0L engine, nor do I want to unbalance the piston weights. So, how much 
&gt;variation would you accept for a &quot;beater&quot; engine???
&gt;

If you want a &quot;beater&quot; engine, don't bother with specifications. That, in
essence, is the definition of a &quot;beater&quot;. If you balance the cc'c, they
will still be balanced if you install them later on another specification
headspaced balanced cylinders/pistons set.
