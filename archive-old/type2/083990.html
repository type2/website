Subject: Re: [T2] Michelin MX availability?

Sean,

It seems like I saw them at Wally World.  I think that's what I'm
running on my wife's water cooled POS, er beautiful Chrysler.

&gt; Hi guys,
&gt; Today someone slashed the left rear tire on my '79 Bus.  This Bus has
&gt; Michelin MX 185R14 tires which are basically in new condition, they don't
&gt; have a lot of miles on them.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd like to get a new MX to match but I'm not sure if they're still
&gt; available.  Tire Rack doesn't seem to have them, though they do have a
&gt; Michelin Agilis in that size.  I'm kind of iffy on mixing tread patterns.
&gt; Does anyone know if the MX is still available from Michelin?  If so, perhaps
&gt; I can have a local tire shop order it.
