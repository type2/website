&gt; While it's still Friday, can we entertain Clara's question about

&gt; I miss the VB people, Clara especially.

As the owner of a baywindow with a type 1 engine I sidestep the problem
by simply subscribing to both lists.  I see everything, but those who
don't want to see bay or split traffic still have the option to view only
what they want to see.
