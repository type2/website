Hello volks,

This isn't entirely T2 material, but I hope it is OK.

My son wants to buy an aircooled VW that is a good daily driver, for $1000 or 
as close to that as possible. No limits on type/style except no super Beetles 
(Ghia or Thing would be nice :-).

We are located near Knoxville TN and would drive as much as 4 hours to 
retrieve it.

Cheers/Don Carron
