&gt; 
&gt; Don't forget that the 914 has flat top pistons..... the bus has dished
&gt; pistons. 
&gt; The cam is different also.

karl,

there were also dished 914 pistons, but they have a much smaller dish (6cc
vs. 15cc) than a bus. the flat pistons were found on european models, though
it is common to see them on us models which have been rebuilt.

i have a set of the 914 pistons in my bus motor, they give a CR of about
7.8:1.
