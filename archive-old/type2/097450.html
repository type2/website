Subject: Brake Adjusters!!!

Oh, wise and giving list........HELP!

For the first time in our nearly two year relationship, my bus has defeated
me. Neither experience, native wit, luck or brute force could prevail over a
stuck rear brake adjusting screw and star wheel.

Here's the specs: 1974 bus, stock brake system. I started to do a rear brake
adjustment today and found (you guessed it) that the star wheels were all
frozen solid. I expected that and was prepared. Some penetrating oil, some
heat, some hammer and punch work, and they were free. All but one, that is.
This one is s-t-u-c-k stuck, folks. My best efforts couldn't make it budge
the merest fraction of a millimeter in any direction.

Here's the question: I see that the housing for the adjusters is held in by
two bolts and a pin, or maybe a rivet. Has anyone suceeded in taking these
off the backing plate and then putting them back on? I guess the pin can be
driven out, or drilled if necessary, and then replaced with a rolled pin or
similar. I think if I get the housing into a vice I can muscle the star
wheel out. Then I can clean the housing and put in new wheels and screws all
round.

Opinions? Dire warnings? Suggestions? All are appreciated.

Thanks,
Dave
