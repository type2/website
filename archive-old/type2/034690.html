Mine have the original tubes threaded in and they are brazed off about 6&quot; from
the head.

&gt; &gt;My brake servo is not connected to any vacuum how much loss of braking

&gt; &gt;this cause?

You already know about brake booster assist, but i wanted to advised that
maybe, since this booster line isn't hooked up, there is something that it is
not hooked up to, and that is a vac port somewhere in the intake system.  If
you're running a single Weber, there oughtta be a big 0.5&quot; port on the
manifold.  I don't know where it hooks for duals or FI, but if the vac port
for the brake booster is not hooked up to the booster or plugged, you have a
vacuum leak and you're running leaner and hotter than you should - potentially
dangerous for your engine - specifically the heads.

Just FYI,
clark gordon
