I posted awhile ago about needing a wiring harness for a 70 standard. A few
people replied (thank you) but I couldn't find what I was looking for: a
complete, new loom for my 70.  It seems impossible to find and even the few
wiring shops I've talked with were reluctant to sell me anything but the
main loom.  My poor bus is in dire need of wire - the PO replaced every wire
with a makeshift one of his own.  A complete mess and hazard.   Any help
would greatly be appreciated.
