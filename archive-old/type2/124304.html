Subject: Re: [T2] CHT sender follow-up redux

We have an aircraft mechanic that builds T4 for aircraft. I asked him about 
the accuracy problems in CHT for VW. He said accurate instruments that are 
aircraft certified are hundreds of dollars.

&gt; Now that I've taken things for a test drive, I have found the the
temperature gradient curve is logarithmic instead of linear.  What this
means is if you test your sender with boiling water and it reads a
little bit off, it will read WAY off by the time the temperature gets
up into the 400 degree neighborhood.
