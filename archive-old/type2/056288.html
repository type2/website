Hi,

&gt; .. it turns out to be a 76 and on ge (2000)
&gt; motor. .. there
&gt; is only 4 more horses from the 2000 than the 1700. does that 300 cc make that
&gt; much difference? what about mpg?

 The 2.0l has little more power but a lot more torque, especially at the bottom end, where you need it in a loaded delivery vehicle. Check the maximum torque spec. and you'll find it is higher, and developed at lower revs. 
Horsepower sells cars, torque wins races (and delivers goods! :-).

Cheers,
        W.
