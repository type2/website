&gt; I agree with those that said you are better off with

&gt; work withstand snow loads
&gt; up here (PA)... Mostly.....


Luckily I live in Colorado now. I have had 1/2 the
paint stripped down to the bare metal for a week
(until I get a chance to prime it) and there has not
been any rust starting. 

If I were still in Hawaii, the nose would have been
eaten thru already!
