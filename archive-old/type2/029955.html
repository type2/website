Volks, 

To change the subject slightly...

I am about ready to take my '67 down to Kelly (Metwiz) for w whole lot of
de-rustification :-)  I finally have good brakes (priority one), good
steering (priority two) and a decent engine.  Before I take it, I am
stripping it out of *everything* other than the glass I need to keep the
interior dry, the driver's seat, and the electrics that will keep me legal
:-)

As I remove the interior, I am *amazed* a the amount of fiberglass that I
am pulling out from behind every panel!  This seemed to be the sound
deadening material of choice for the Westfalia Werke, at least.  Now there
are places where this has led to rust forming, but never against the metal
where the FG was placed! Rather the rust seems to have formed at the
bottom of the cavity where the water drainded and was unable to escape.  
The compartments where the rust formed were also usually compartments
topped by a window.  I have always been afraid to use FG as a sound
deadening material, because I feared that it would trap moisture against
the metal and cause rust. I am now wondering if this fear was not
baseless.  It now seems to me to be more important to keep water from
entering the compartment (good window seals) and to be very sure that any
drains at the bottom of the compartment are clear.

I am kind of awaiting this trip just to see how loud a tin can a bus can
become if you remove *all* of the sound deading material :-)  An adventure
fersure!  Earplugs anyone? :-) I doubt that I will have *any* problems
hearing exactly what the engine is doing on this trip :-)

Lastly,  there have been a couple of mentions of using roofing products or
asphalt-based products as sound deading materials in your bus... IMHO,
this is a very bad idea!  In addittion, I would be careful of any spray-in
foam.  Check to make sure that the words &quot;urea-formaldehyde&quot; do not appear
anywhere on the can!  Off-gassing from foams even after they have cured
can be a serious problem!
