In-Reply-To: &lt;199812161147.EAA08736_at_yiff.azaccess_dot_com&gt; from Erik Meltzer at &quot;Dec 16, 98 04:47:52 am&quot;

&gt; Having thought about and discussed this idea of Barry's about coping 
&gt; with too-low garage doors:
&gt; &gt; Let me see.  Combining your top two ideas, if you remove the 'junk'
&gt; &gt; rubber from the wheels by pulling each side OVER the rim (so that the
&gt; &gt; rubber tire sort of flops around OUTSIDE of the rims), you could scootch
&gt; &gt; the 'bus' into the garage without damage to the floor.
&gt; 
&gt; I found it would not work: the inner sidewall would interfere with 
&gt; suspension parts, brake lines etc., probably resulting in damage to 
&gt; at least the latter -- sorry :-)

Would it be possible to get some leetle tiny tires (maybe from a Yugo or
something like that), with an OD of slightly more than 14&quot;, cut them open,
put them snugly on the junk rims, and then staple them back together?

I mean, junk (like, worn out, no treat, completely toasted) tires can't be
very expensive.  :)
