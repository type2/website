Subject: RE: [T2] Chrome Locking Gas Caps are Back!

&gt;   I got one of these from Ron and it is nice looking etc. BUT while the
&gt; cam comes out like it is supposed to, with a little wiggling I can still
&gt; get the gas cap off in the locked position.

&gt; I got one too, although mine seems very snug and couldn't wiggle
&gt; it off.


I recall being able to extract the stock locking gas cap off of my '77 quite
some years ago without too much difficulty after I broke my key (which was
actually quite a relief under the circumstances!). The latch mechanism on
the late bus locking caps is not an ideal theft-proof device, but it is what
it is if you want a stock locking cap. For what it's worth, the caps I have
are from the German supplier to VW, and are the same as sold by ALL sources
(including VW) for many, many years (until they went unavailable last year;
now only I and VW have any left).  If ultimate security is your goal,
perhaps your local FLAPS has something generic that might lock more
securely, I'm not sure.  But I can say that there are no _stock_ looking
ones available that do.  Personally, though, I doubt that, seeing a locked
gas cap on the bus, most criminals would go to the trouble of seeing how
easily they could jimmy it; kind of like an alarm, the existence of the cap
is the largest deterrant.  (One note: while the VW locking cap may not be
jimmy-proof, it should stay on securely; it should not feel like it's likely
to fall off when you drive down the road. If it does not latch securely,
make sure that the metal around the filler opening is not bent and that the
gasket is present.)
