Subject: gas heater ducting

I am looking for some suggestions on how to duct the output of my
southwind heater to the inside of the bus. I have a few ideas, but
have never gotten the chance to look closely at one that was from the
factory/dealer. where is the penetration for the duct? Anyone have any
idea If I can connect the output to the input of the aux heater fan?
TIA
