Hey Volks!

I've just replaced my break lines and M.C.  My problem concerns the area 
where the front break line connects w/the splitter that distributes 
fluid to the front breaks.  The line leaks like a SOB and I've put two 
new lines in and both have leaked.  It looks like fluid is getting 
between the tube and the threading/nut thing.

I've tried teflon tape (but that was a real mess) and I've tried pulling 
the flanged end back against the thread/nut thing while screwing the nut 
into the splitter (make sense?).  All to no avail.

Have I gotten two bad lines or is there some obvious answer that my 
feeble brain just can't conceive?  Any suggestions would GREATLY be 
appreciated!
