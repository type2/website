Subject: Advice on Purchase of 77 Auto/Air

Hello fellow lovers of VW Buses and Campbuses!

I need some advice...in a hurry.  I have previously owned 2 VW Campers
(70 &amp; 71) which I was talked into selling because my ex-husband got
tired of getting them fixed and he didn't have the time or patience to 
repair them himself.  

Now I find myself longing for another VW Campbus and my brother 
located one for me about 3 hours from here and went to see it (he lives
in S.C and drove 3 hours round trip to check it out).

It is a l977, gold with good interior, air conditioning that appears to 
work (!) and automatic transmission.  The problem was it cranked once
but the second time it wouldn't.  He said there was more rust than he
liked (Daytona was it's home for many years) but it was a two owner and
it was originally imported from Germany by the original owner.

Now you can see I am NOT a technical expert on anything drivable.
Is it ridiculous for me to try to get this bus which may or may not have
a good engine and trust my brother (who is a BMW-VOLVO freak)?
He has advised against this because I am single and wants me to have
dependable transportation for myself and my girls.

BUT I WANT AND NEED A VW!!!!  You guys/gals understand this
problem.  I have gone 3 years without one and I have gotten tired of
screaming &quot;CAMPBUS,CAMPBUS!!!&quot; every time we see one one the
highway.  Many of my friends have had slight heart-attacks from this....

Thanks for any advice you can give me... and by the way, they will take
$1000.00 for one!

J. Martin
Soon to be owner of SOME KIND OF VW BUS!!!
