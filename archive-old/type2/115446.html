Did they advertise in HVW's?  The photo shown on their website is of the 
smaller Porsche lug pattern.  The ad I saw stated you could use the wide 
pattern.  Perhaps they machined a modified hub.  I'm looking for quality 
stopping power that'll still allow me to use my wheels.  There is a kit 
available, but it has GM calipers, and I'm not a big fan of their design.
