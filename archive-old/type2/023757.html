Shawn,
	Note that the front studs are 45mm, only the rears are 35mm. You can
use
the fronts on the rears to get an extra 10mm but need to get longer ones
still
for the front!!

Cheers,
	W.

PS I posted this info for Rick in heidelberg last week but didn't see it
appear
in the list reflector at www.type2_dot_com. Maybe my posts arn't getting
through?
