Subject: RE: [T2] Valve Clearance .006 or .008?  

Also, if you have chromoly push rods and solid rockers, can't you tighten 
the adjusters to the point where you can still just barely swivel the push 
rod without it binding (Loose 0)?  I got this in VWTr3nds recent budget 
beater series where they shortened their push rods and put them in using 
that method.  I had never heard of that before, but my typeI uses the 
chromoly pushrods, so I am curious.  Here is a link to the article:

http://www.vwtrendsweb_dot_com/archives/tech/0702_tech01.shtml

What do the machine heads about this?  Doesn't that risk leaving a valve 
part way open if you are off in finding when cylinder 1, 2, 3, or 4 fires 
when you zero it out? I find it TypeIV related as well, since when I rebuild 
my TypeIV motor it's definitely getting the hardened push rods.
