Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Trans dilemma...

The 74 trans most likely contains the same ratios as the 75.  I say most 
likely because the manuals don't make it clear when the change from the 
5.375 ring and pinion to the 4.86 ring and pinion took place.  It was 
either the middle or the beginning of the '74 model year.  All '74's that I 
have driven had the 4.86, but I have only driven a few.  The '75 tranny 
case has a few more ribs than the '74, but I believe they are completely 
interchangeable.  Bottom line, if it's a '74 tranny you should remove the 
rear cover of the tranny before you install it (make sure to obtain a new 
gasket first, it may not be easy) and count the teeth in the pinion.  If it 
has 8 teeth, it is 5.375.  If it has 7 teeth, it is 4.86 and the same as 
the '75 tranny.  I would go with the 4.86 ratio unless you want 
stump-pulling ratios in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd (4th is about the same in the two 
trannies).

&gt;Hey folks,
&gt;
&gt;I have a dilemma,  see I have a 75 westy with a blown 75 transmission and a
&gt;74 1800 pancake with a single Holley dual progressive carb in Bam-Bam and I
&gt;want to change the trans but not sure if I should get the 74 0r 75 trans to
&gt;match my 74 (1800) pancake.  If any one has any prior experience with this
&gt;match or ideas on what year trans would best suit my engine/vehicle any
&gt;advice would be greatly appreciated.
