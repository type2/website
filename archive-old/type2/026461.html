Subject: RE: VW engine modifications

&gt;instead I got &quot;buy a ford&quot; and &quot; A VW is not for you&quot;.  

Those sort of responses were probably not called for.  The fact that you
have taken the time to join our little family of listees show that you have
at least the makings for another bus nut and should be treated as such.
Your original post did come across with a presumptive attitude which is why
I didn't bother to respond to it.  Don't let some negative responses turn
you off, though.

&gt;what successful modifications do you recommend and what 
&gt;kind of gains did you get? (I.E. carbs mods, rocker arms,
&gt;external oil coolers, engine rebuild kits, high voltage ignitions etc.
&gt;thank-you.  And please lets be postive to each other!

The fact is, a 3600 pound brick-shaped vehicle with a 30 year old
technology, 60 hp, 4cylinder motor is just simply not going to go very fast.
However, you can minimize the performance limitations of an early loaf bus
if you are willing to throw a little money at the problem.  

There are really NOT any bolt-on power improvements that don't involve
rebuilding at least the top end of your motor.  Adding hot ignition systems
or high performance carbs to a stock motor makes as much sense as putting
racing slicks and a blower on a yugo - it just makes for a more expensive
pig.

One possibility is to build up your 1700 motor with a set of 96mm cylinders
and pistons, bigger valves, and a pair of Weber carbs.  That should give you
quite a bit more power.  Another, more popular choice is to get a 2.0 from a
later model bus and transplant it.  It's pretty much a bolt-in process.
Either route will boost you HP by as much as 50% (up to 90hp from 60).  I
prefer the idea of a stock 2.0 just because they've got a proven track
record for reliability and longevity with stories of well over 100k miles
before rebuilding.  This type of solution will range anywhere from $700
(cost of parts for new P&amp;C, head work, pair of Weber carbs on your existing
engine) up to about $1000 (cost of good, used 2.0 plus cost of parts for
stock rebuild).  Of course, costs can be higher depending on the work that
needs to be done and whether you do your own work.

If that's still not enough umph, you can always build a bad-ass type IV
motor that will pump out 140 - 190 hp.  But those tend to be hot-running,
short-lived motors.

Then, if that's still not enough go-go juice, you can look into engine
transplants.  A 911 3.0 6 cylinder with 200+ hp in a fairly bullet-proof
case is a nice option.  Of course, it'll cost you $3000 just buy a decent,
running motor plus another $600-1000 for the conversion.  Others have
transplanted VW Rabbit motors, Subaru motors, and even Chevy or Buick small
blocks.  Again, the conversion costs of these can get quite substantial and
if you're using a water-cooled engine, you gotta find some asthetically
pleasing place to mount the radiator.

Some folks are perfectly content to tool around in their bone-stock buses at
60 mph.  Nothing wrong with that - I've been doing it for 8 years.  But I'm
currently building a 2.0 to put in my 73.  Figure out the balance between
your needs and your pocketbook and go for it.  There's lots of answers and
opinions here on the list.  Ask what you will and you'll probably get good
answers (even if they're not always the ones you want).
