Subject: Re-tired

You can also run 27x8.5 x14 if you want mud and
snow or sand performance.  I currently run a set
of all terrain tires on my 70.  They aren't loud
and ride nice.  The road noise from the engine
drowns out any tire noise, if there is any.  You
can search them on tire rack, using the select
tire size option, and inputting &quot;LT27&quot; &quot;8.5&quot; and
&quot;14.&quot;  Most generic places will have these also. 
All that I have seen are reinforced load range C
with around 1540 lbs max and 50 max pressure.    
 

Also, consider these Coopers.

They are the ones on the left. 

These are my favorite bus tires, bar none.  Nice
true all season tires that had no problem with
West Virginia winters.  They were really stiff
and firmed up the steering on the highway.  If
I'd known they were still being sold, I would
have bought these 195R14C with the 2000lb max
load.
