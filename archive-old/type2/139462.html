Subject: Re: [T2] VWTrends rumor

Hi Dave,

Odd that they would be leaving the scene just as a few local bookstores 
have started importing large format European VW mags.

But not all that surprising... I think it's at least partly due to 
VWoA's persecution of the community, making smaller shops more cautious 
about advertising their products lest they catch VW's corporate 
litigator's eye.  And due to the high quality advice and entertainment 
available free on the internet.

It was nice to see their coverage of Canadian VW events, I got pictures 
of my bus in there twice and Dad's westy was in there once as well.


Happy trails,

Greg Potts
