Subject: Re: [T2] Pain(t)/body

Has anyone done any 'how-to' guides on this process?

I see those all the time, although ive only seen the offroad trucks 
around here sporting that paint job.

I like it. Call me crazy, but I think it looks great.

&gt; At BBBX, there were a few guys with Bays that they had painted with pickup
&gt; bed liner material.  Looked pretty darned good and it was extremely
&gt; scratch resistant.  Nice bright colors, too.  You have to get into the
&gt; texture, though.
