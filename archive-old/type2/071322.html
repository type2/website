I'm currently trying to get my 78 sunroof bus running.  I've done some trouble shooting on the motor and found that the Fuel injection was not working.  I checked the combi-relay and found that it was not function correctly, so I replaced it. I also replaced a fuse that was blown.  Now it works.. The question i have is, with all the plugs in the engine the engine turns over hard and will not start, I know its getting fuel.  If i remove all the plugs it turns over freely with out any problem..Do you have any suggestion about what I should try next..I have spark and the coil works.  I did have one wire that had no place on the coil so I put it on term. 1.. Maybe I should also ask if you know what wires go on each term of the coil..Thanks for you help. Mike
