Volks,

OK, it's like this...  On the one hand, it is very possible for me to post
a set of hard rules and come down like a ton of bricks on any violation.
On the other hand it would be a pretty small list.  In large part, tho I
can talk and moderate like crazy, it is *you* collectively who determine
the personality and content of the list.  If I suggest something, like
off-list surveys, and the posts don't even slow down there is very little
that I can do.

I try very hard not to control the content of the list.  The ebay series
started because, in addition to a growing number of posters, I started to
get significant numbers of complaints.  It is the first topic that was
even close to the list that I have moderated in the past year.  When posts
drift off-topic, I tend to P-mail the poster and suggest that they may
be drifting, rather than coming out and banning topics.

I often dissagree with posts, but I don't go public unless it is a grave
violation of the charter or I perceive some danger to the list.  I try
very hard to be king log, but by times I just get upset.  Right now, the
sore points are:

-Surveys. This past Friday, I asked that surveys be conducted off-list and
the results posted.  There is a very good reason for that.  Here in the
US, we get unlimited no- or very low-cost access time, or get access at
work.  We assume that is the standard.  It isn't!  We are not
type2-us_dot_com.  We are world-wide, and in most other places people pay by
the minute for access.  Keeping traffic down is not just nice, it is
necessary.  In addition we are approaching 1000 members. A universal
response to a survey would swamp the server and put us out of business.

-Friday lasting until the next Wednesday.  The very last time zone passes
midnight at 1200 GMT on Saturday.  Any Friday posts after that upset me no
end.  I know digest subscribers may miss out because a digest does not
spawn before the deadline passes, but that's what patience is made for.
Wait 'til the next Friday, please!

- non-moderator complaints.  If you post a complaint to the list, it goes
to (as of 9:00 this morning) 908 people.  907 of them can't do anything
about it.  I can.  Please e-mail me, not the list.  I take all comments
that I get very seriously.

-posts on dope.  These are *really* not on topic.

I am at something of a loss.  I would like all of the above to cease, but
I do not want to be more of an ogre than I abolutely have to be.  I would
much rather that you all just sat back and had a good think before you
posted.  (Note also the following post, however.)
