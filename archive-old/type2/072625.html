Subject: a  hot key

On my '71 Westy,  I'm diagnosing electrical problems under the dashboard.
Specifically, random toggling of the high beams and intermittend buzzing of
the ignition key alarm buzzer,  usually triggered by moving the key around
in the ignition switch.  I have been tracing the voltages and resistances
with Bentley in one hand.  Today, I put a voltmeter on the ignition key
while I pushed wires around. I found there is 12V on the key almost all the
time.  Does anyone know if this is normal?

Jack
