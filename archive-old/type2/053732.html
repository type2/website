Subject: 1st Time Bus Owner Needs Help

Hello Everyone out in VW Land

My name is Jeff and I'm a 1st time bus owner.  I was lookin' for a bus
for about 2 yrs. and finally saw my baby!  She's a '71 westy and is in
mint condition.  The prevoius owner took great care of her and it had
only 47k original miles.  I feel like I must refer to the bus as a
women, cuz it looks so great!  She has the orginal bug engine, 1600cc, 4
spd., and all the rest...

So this is the deal...

In August I plan on travelling out East, I live in Ontario, Canada so
out east is heading towards Newfounfland, blah blah blah....   So I've
taken some measurers to help myself out.  Bought a book, but was
wondering what the deal is about the Bentley manuel or the Haynes
manuel.  I'm also going to have a bunch of spare parts.  Any suggestions
on what to bring?  Starting to work on her to get her in shape for the
trip, but I also realize that I'm going to have some problems.  I also
don't drive her faster than 55 mph.

So this is what happend...

I was driving along, about 4 hours into the drive, and all of a sudden
there was a loud noise and the bus lost power.  Was unable to get it
started and eventually got it towed to a shop.  I realized later that I
had a vaccum leak in the carb and popped the distributor cap.  There was
also bad sparkage so he replaced the plugs.  Two weeks later I'm driving
and once again it losses power.  So I get it fixed again and I put in a
new fuel pump, thinking that it might of been clugged due to running the
fuel low, and once again there's bad sparkage and I put in new plugs,
and change the oil.  Then one more time I was driving and it felt like
it loss power but didn't die this time.  I haven't had a chance to look
at the plugs yet, but she's still running.  I'm beginning to lose it
with her.  I can't even drive 4 hrs with her not having troubles and I'm
going travellin' soon.  I'm willing to spend some good money on her to
fix it up.  Either doing some of the repairs myself or getting a shop to
do it.  I'm also willing if anyone in my area works on vw's, and would
like to do it for some cash, that's cool too!!  I had to try!!

I'll be putting in a fuel filter to help out with the fuel not
clogging.  So the bus keeps having problems with the spark plugs so I'm
thinking on replacing the wires.  Like I said I'm willing to spend a
good dollar so that she'll be ready for the trip.  If you have any
suggestions on things I should do before the trip to the bus, spare
parts to bring, or just any common knowledge that would be very
appreciated!  I've also signed up with AIRS and in the process of
signing up with Limbo.  I thank you very much for all your help and
thanks for reading all this!

Thanks again,

Jeff Talosi
