Subject: Re: [T2] '71 westy interior question

&gt; PS Isn't there a link to a westy manual online somewhere?


The link I had to the manual is broken apparently:
http://www.i405_dot_com/vw/Tech/70Westy.asp

If the owner of this site has a new link let me know. Or if somebody else
has a link already. I do have the manual and can scan it if nobody else has.

Here is a link to the dealer brochure:
http://www.72camper_dot_com/71westy.htm

This is the brochure that covers 70/71 as far as I know. There is one for
the 73, but I have never seen one specifically for the 71 or 72. The 70 and
71 are very similar, except the brakes and the 72 and 73 are similar too.
Here is the one for the 73:

If anybody has a dealer brochure for a 72 or 71
specifically let me know.


Westfalia made all the Campmobiles. Some had an optional pop-top, among
other things.
Here is a link to see some more brochures of Westies and their available
options:
