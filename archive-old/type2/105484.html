&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, I have remembered that part of bus driving.  Hence my desire to move
&gt; &gt; &gt; the spare to the front of the bus.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I don't think VW had that add-on in mind when they did their crash testing
&gt; &gt;because the body will deform before the bumper can absorb the impact. The
&gt; &gt;Euro models had the extended bumper for the tire carrier for a reason: with
&gt; &gt;the tire mounted you increase your chance of nose damage if someone
&gt; &gt;accidentally backs into you.
&gt;
&gt; As opposed to what?  Having some SUV just back into the nose itself?

Most of the cars on the road match the bumper height of the bus relatively
well, particularly if overriders are installed.  The bumper is designed
with a little &quot;give&quot; to it (that's why the mounting holes are slotted, to
allow the bumper to slide).  If you get hit on the bumper at low speeds
you are unlikely to sustain damage.

OTOH, the tire mounted above the bumper will transfer any impact loads
directly to the front sheet metal of your bus.  There is no &quot;give&quot; to
that, it just dents.

Also, the high-mounted tire will cause more damage to the other vehicle,
since it doesn't match the other car's bumper.  That's the major complaint
against the &quot;evil SUVs&quot;

&gt; I had a little girl pull out right in front of me on a state highway, when
&gt; I was driving
&gt; my Thing(tm).  If it were not for the spare tire on the front, and another
&gt; on top of
&gt; the hood, rather than just having part of the steering column go under my
&gt; kneecap,
&gt; I'd have most likely had the leg removed.

I really doubt that the spares made that much of a difference.  A wheel is
a very rigid object for its mass and doesn't really make that good of a
&quot;crush space&quot;.  A tire on the hood of a thing is more likely to be pushed
through the windshield into the faces of the passengers than it is to
cushion an impact.

The dynamics of energy absorption during a crash are very complex.  Just
putting an object between you and the colliding vehicle doesn't always
help matters.

&gt;
&gt; I keep my spare on the front of the bus.
&gt;
&gt; I also broke the windshield with my face.  Twice.  So if your &quot;old&quot; car
&gt; didn't come stock
&gt; with shoulder belts.  INSTALL SOME FOR GAWD'S SAKES!!  There's been one or
&gt; two actual improvements, in automobiles, since the early sixties, and
&gt; that's one of 'em.

True.  One caveat, though.  If your bus lacks hard points for the shoulder
harness, make sure the ones you fabricate are as strong as the later
factory ones.  Picture having that attach point tear loose and whip around
your body with a jagged piece of body sheet metal attached!  Not pretty!

PS:  Driving as if you were an Aztec sacrifice strapped to the front of
the vehicle is also helpful.  This was one thing that John Muir was
correct about.

PPS:  I believe that the accident rate would plummet if the law were
changed to prohibit seat belts and air bags entirely and to mandate that a
6&quot; sharpened steel spike be installed in the center of every steering
wheel.
