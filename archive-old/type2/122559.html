&gt; I hooked up a vacuum gauge and measured 12'', but this engine doesn't

&gt; your engine is still breaking in.

With the engine tight vacuum should be high.

&gt; For kicks, I pulled the gauge off
&gt; with the engine still running, and the resulting vacuum leak did not
&gt; seem to affect the running of the engine in the slightest.

That should cause it to stall. Vacuum should be 16-18&quot;.

&gt; Putting the 
&gt; vacuum cap back on the tee didn't change it, either.  Now I'm wondering
&gt; if I have a vacuum leak ... there are new hoses all around, except for
&gt; the brake booster.  I suppose I should pull that off the Y fitting, cap
&gt; off the Y, and check vacuum again.

Install the brake booster valve I gave you...

&gt; Hm.  &quot;Sat for how long?&quot;  When I was over at Richard's place helping
&gt; him drop his engine, we needed some place to put the fuel that was
&gt; drained from his tank.  We had a little left after filling up his
&gt; wife's car, and so we dumped the rest into my tank.  I know he hadn't
&gt; been doing much driving of his Bus ever since his clutch started
&gt; slipping... but his best guess at the time was that the gas was maybe 2
&gt; months old?  Anyway, it couldn't have been more than 3 or 4 gallons
&gt; that we transfered into my half-full tank, and afterward, I topped it
&gt; off with 89.

It was no more than 3 gallons. I watched the gas come out: it was clean but
two months old. You drove home 40 miles without incident...plus the filter
would show any blockage before the pump got contaminated. I'd feel
uncomfortable draining a bus gas tank and pouring the contents into another
bus if I had not POR-15's the tank and made it better than new.

The other car didn't even burp on the 4-5 gallons of that same old gas. I
even fired up the motorcycle and dumped 2 gallons of 6 month old gas into
the other car. It didn't care. The Chevron site says gas is good for a year.

It sounds like something is clogging the tank outlet.
