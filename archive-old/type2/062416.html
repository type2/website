        ...was sorta OK.

        Not a lot to buy this time 'round, which is the norm.  About half,
if not fewer, people swapping this time.

        Bought a barndoor/split-window radio, $200 (Philips); 2 of the cargo
door latches I needed, $5 each; an early Columbia bike; a set of high-hinge
cargo doors; a cool TootsieToy car hauler with 3 oval window bugs on it,
missing the ramp; barndoor starter button ($20); early engine lid holdup,
$10; a few other bits and pieces.

        Saw the '54 ambulance thats for sale: very rough.  This thing is
going to need a lot of work!
