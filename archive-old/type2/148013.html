Usually it goes out right away: 1-2 seconds. I've found that with  
hydraulic lifters the light will stay on longer (5 sec) if the  
lifters don't pump up immediately.

&gt; Oil pressure goes to 60psi at idle.
&gt; Pressure stays 55-60 psi at speed and at idle as long as oil
&gt; temp is &lt; 180F.

Seems normal.

&gt; As the temp approaches 180F, the idle pressure starts
&gt; to come down. Once engine is warm, oil pressure at idle is 15-20psi.

OK.

&gt; Does the 2.0L engine have 2 oil pressure valves?
&gt; If it has two, I know one is to prevent excess pressure from going
&gt; to the cooler and the other is to bypass the cooler when the oil
&gt; is not hot.

The second valve limits overall oil pressure. The solid lifter  
engines have two, the hydraulic lifters engines have one.

There is a better photo of this diagram on page 40 of Wilson.
