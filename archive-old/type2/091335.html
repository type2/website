&gt;
&gt;  Wrangler RT/S
&gt;
&gt; Size 195R14
&gt; External diameter 665.48 mm
&gt; Wide 198.12 mm
&gt; Wheel wide 5.5- 6.5
&gt; Max weight    949 Kg
&gt; Max pressure 65 psi

These seem pretty good.  They are slightly larger than stock, so the
engine will turn a bit slower.  Load range is good.  Wish we could find
this size in the US!
