Hi all - The sad day has come. I need to sell my bus. She is a 1978
Transporter. Very little rust, brand new front axle beam, new front tires,
new front shocks, new battery, her heating system is intact and works - but
there is no additional fans on there to help it along, she has a new stereo
with cd player (obviously not stock - but will help to keep you sane on long
drives!). The only thing is that cyclinders #1 and 2 are dead and so she
will either need a rebuild or a new short block. The estimate I got for all
of this is around $4500. She is in pretty good condition other than that -
and with a real nice paint job. I do not have the money for this and i'm a
little strung out on the unreliability. At the moment - even if I could
afford it I'm not sure I would because I can't take it right now. I think I
need a break from the &quot;vintage VW's&quot; for a while. Please pass this on to
anyone who might be interested. She will need towed but I could store her
for you until you can get here. I'm not sure what a good asking price is but
I paid $3900 for her less than two years ago and have put in $5000 in her
since. I'll have pictures soon - just gotta get organized so email me for
more info.  I'm just looking for someone to give Gertie a good home. Thanks
Chrissie
