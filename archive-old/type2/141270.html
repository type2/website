Subject: RE: [T2] who sells the cheapest TMI headliner

Jim Thompson wrote...

&gt;  Acme makes the best quality and fitting headlinder
&gt;  for the Bus and Pickup Models, hands-down; heck
&gt;  they've been producing them for over 40 years. I've yet
&gt;  to get a TMI headlinder fit worth a dang in a Type 2,
&gt;  no matter what year, they still have a long way to go
&gt;  in fixing their design(s) and cut(s) for proper fitment.
&gt;  Acme does cost a few bucks more than the TMI, but
&gt;  here's a situation where I think you get yer money's
&gt;  worth - ya get what ya pay for.


The headliners we ship are almost exclusively Acme, not TMI (except in
isolated cases; i.e. if Acme doesn't have the pattern). I would second Jim's
opinion on their quality, and also add that their customer service is better
(they ship faster, and tend to be more responsive in the rare case where
there is a problem). If you shop around, you'll find that our prices for
Acme headliners are frequently LOWER than many shops charge for TMI.
