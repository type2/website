&gt;How do the vacuum lines go on a 74 dual carb setup?
&gt;
&gt;Right now I've got:
&gt;1) From the body of the left carb to the lower (inner) inlet on the 
&gt;distributor
&gt;2) From the base of the right carb to the upper (outer) inlet on the 
&gt;distributor
&gt;3) From the base of the left carb to, oh I don't know, I guess it's the 
&gt;EGR check valve
&gt;
&gt;Should I probably have both dizzy lines going to the left carb?
&gt;And then what, from the base of the right carb to the EGR(?) valve?

Phil,

If I had a dollar for every time I've answered this question I wouldn't be 
rich, but I'd be able to buy a few tanks of gas for my bus.

It should be a simple matter to find the answer to this question in the 
archives at www.type2_dot_com.

Your hoses are hooked up wrong.  There shouldn't be a port at the base of 
the right carb.  The port at the base of the left carb should go to the 
lower (inner) inlet on the distributor.  The port on the body of the left 
or right carb should go to the upper (outer) inlet on the 
distributor.  There, that's one more gallon.  :-)
