My fire story is a good one.  I was road racing a Mazda rx2 and we =
needed a small hose clamp.  My brother lent one from his 65 beetle.  =
Guess what never got back!!  About 1 mile from the course on the way =
home, my friend says &quot;boy matt's car really runs rich, look at all that =
smoke!&quot;  I knew it was on fire immediately, as that smoke was rolling =
out of the top vents.  Matt pulleed off the road, l;ooked in the =
compartment, and saw a small fire.  He LEFT THE LID OPEN! and casually =
walked to the front of the car.  I stopped my bus in the middle of the =
road, quickly got my 5lb extinguisher and ran to the car.  The engine =
compartment was totally engulfed by now, but a combination of closing =
the lid and two quick bursts from the extinguisher killed the fire.  The =
only damage to the car was the wire form the coil to the points and some =
soot.  The entire episode lasted only 1 minute of so, but any longer and =
it would have been all over

CARRY A GOOD, BIG FIRE EXTINGUISHER
