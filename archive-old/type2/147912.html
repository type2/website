Subject: Re: max safe cylinder head temps (was: Diagnostic expertise...)

 &gt;Our 1978 bus with FI 2.0 cruises at around 425-450 at 60 mph on a 70
 &gt;degree day, depending on wind direction and grade.  I have played with
 &gt;timing, mixture, and made incremental cooling improvements, but those
 &gt;cruising temps don't seem to change.  The bus will happily cruise at
 &gt;65-70, but head temp readings rise to 450-475 at those speeds so we've
 &gt;kept it to 55-60.

Assuming your gauge is accurate those temps are too high. The problems I've 
seen recently mentioned on various lists resulting in high head temps are: 
vacuum leaks, flaps attached to the thermostat not fully opening, and a 
cylinder with low compression.

Have you tried taking off sparkplug leads one at a time when the engine is 
idling? If the cylinder is firing properly there will be a noticeable drop 
in revs when its lead is removed.

Cheers,

Martin.
