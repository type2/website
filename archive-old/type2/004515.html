I tested the Berg device in boiling water.  The wire rotated to within about
1/8&quot; or a little more from contacting the screw, basically what they (Berg)
say it should do in their instructions.

Flaps are in place and open - T-stat and link rod are MIA (but on order).

I don't understand your procedure for vacuum leak testing with the fuel
hose, old main jet and water bottle - could your explain in more detail?  I
did look for vac leaks using the carb cleaner spray test method - and found
none.

Oil is Castrol 10W40 dino, new about 500 miles ago.

Fan and all shrouds are in place and correct and as far as I know are the
originals that came with the bus.

What do you mean by cool tin vs standard &quot;forget me nots&quot; under the
cylinders?

VDO gauges (OP, OT, CHT) are on order and should be in my hands by next
weekend.

I was not planning on modifying the relief valves, only replacing worn out
parts with new stock type parts if determined that they are in fact worn
out.

As always, your suggestions are most appreciated and helpful.

I suggest testing it out in boiling water.  If it's coming on at 212 degrees
it's gonna be on a lot and you'll never really know if you are overheating.
The VDO gauge setup is really the way to go.

Improve your cooling capacity. T-stat and flaps in place?  Cool tin or
standard &quot;forget me nots&quot; under the cylinders? No vacuum leaks...test with a
water bottle that has a 2 ft fuel hose on it and an old main jet in the end.
All the other basics in order?  Then if you are using decent oil (I like SAE
40 above 68 degrees), 240 is acceptable on the highway at 65.   55?  I think
you have something amiss unless it's real hot outside.  Remember, 10 small
air leaks around the shroud can equal one big one.  Triple check and *seal
all air leaks*.  Metal tape is great on the shrouds.  Might be worth
checking to make sure you have the correct fan as well.  I've seen many
shops put in the narrower one.

To your q's.

1. Possible but very unlikely.  It's fairly idiot proof with a stock oil
pump and can't open at the wrong time
2. The stock spring and &quot;grooved&quot; plunger always works best for me. Leave
the front bypass alone.

In my ongoing effort to see if I can get my 71 Westy to run cooler, last
night I removed and inspected the oil pressure relief valves.

This is a basically stock 1600DP, doghouse, dual relief case engine, with
about 40 to 50K miles since the last rebuild.  I recently installed a Berg
dipstick temperature switch, and found that the thing goes off whenever I
exceed 55 to 60 MPH. As soon as I drop below that speed, the light promptly
goes out.  There doesn't seem to be much relationship to ambient air
temperature.  I've got new manifold boots, new spark plug air seals, the
carb (Brosol 34 PICT 3) has about 30K miles since new, engine to body seal
is good, and all other cooling related items I can think of and easily
inspect are normal.

Both relief valve springs and plungers were whistle clean, and dropped out
easily when I removed the threaded plugs.
