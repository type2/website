Subject: '79 newbie questions

Hello to all!

I've recently (today) been given a '79 bus and I have lots of questions.
But before I inundate you with questions undoubtedly telling of my air
cooled experience, is there a searchable archive for this list as there is
for the vanagon list? And, is there some basic literature available for me
to digest and begin my new journey properly?

Now, a bit o' history. My first car (in 1983) was a '71 superbeetle, and I
owned an '81 rabbit diesel in between before my current '83.5 vanagon
wasserboxer. So I do have a little, although limited, experience with vw's.
I am thrilled to have the '79 loaf as the vanagon just seemed to wet my
appetite for return to air-cooled's.

The most noticeable problem, based on my entire 2 hours of ownership, is
that the bus will not go over 25-30 mph on a flat without sputtering and
threatening to stall. The 4spd tranny seems to shift fine, breaks are ok -
ie it stops :) -, but the exhaust is quite loud and fumes can be smelled
from the outside of the vehicle, the bus starts immediately with no
hesitation. Sooooo, any advice on where to begin? I apologize for my
naivety (sp?), but I figure I have to start somewhere.

Oh, and I sure have missed you all since the split :)

good spirit,

tony
