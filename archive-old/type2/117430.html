&gt; &gt;ok guru's, who can answer my next question.  i have the autotranny bus now
&gt; &gt;and am still thinking i want to go with a h2o motor.  is this even
&gt; &gt;possible,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; is the tranny too weak 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; I suppose it would ultimately depend on the power of the motor.  Folks 
&gt; who upgrade their hp big time ultimately need a trans to compensate. 
&gt;  This is why people put bus trannsmissions in sandrails, add better 
&gt; trans mounts and stuff like that

auto tranny is not as strong as manual.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;next ?  can i have FI with an auto tranny?

absolutely, now what FI
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; assuming that you're talking about stock FI that was put in later buses 
&gt; that's a much more practicle idea.  The bracket for the aircleaner would 
&gt; have to be added and the place for the ECU.  There are several FI buses 
&gt; with auto transmissions on the road as we speak.

there are two basic types of auto tranny the 003 73-75 and the 010
76-79(83 modified)  the 003 is a vacuum shift, while the 010 was govenor
shift, the 010 is by far the stronger and preferred.

&gt; 76 with a blown engine but I basically didn't feel good replacing it 
&gt; with anything other than FI for fear of not passing emissions and 
&gt; whatever else.

the FI is very different but once you understand how it works it is quite
reliable and fuel efficient.
