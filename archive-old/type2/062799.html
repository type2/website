Subject: 23-window dreams

On my way back from an appointment today I spotted a familiar shape out in
a field. Turned around and found the right driveway; knocked on the door.

Me: &quot;Hey, saw your bus out in the field and thought I'd see if it's for
sale.&quot;

Him: &quot;Yeah, it's a 21-window, but it's kinda rough.&quot;

Bottom line, it's a 1959 23-window and it's REALLY rough. The top's
probably salvageable, but not without work. If you went to the Eureka
show, it was up there. You saw it; you passed on it. Guess the guy wants
like $350 for it. If you'd sink another $8000 and 600 hours into, you'd
have a bus. Of course, for the really adventurous, I know where there's
another '59 23-window in about the same (or worse) shape.

Personally, I don't need no steenkin' 23-window bus. I'm not an dubaddict.
;) Joe
