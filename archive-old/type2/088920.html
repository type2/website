Subject: Re: [T2] pressure plate

From: &quot;Bus Gypsy&quot;
&gt;I have a pressure plate for a 71 bus in my 69 now.  Only problem, I need the
pre 71.  Have a 71 engine in a 69 bus.  Need the pressure plate with the ring
on it.  First off, does anybody have a new pre 71 to trade for a new post 71?
I have contacted bus depot a few times on shipping, but no reply.  I am
willing to buy one if anyone knows where.  I also found one for a 61 at a very
good price.  Will the 61 fit my 69?  Need 1 bad.  Only thing keeping my bus in
the driveway right now.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Measure the 61 across the face but more than likely it will be 180mm. Wrong.
You need a 200mm pressure plate.
