 Nikki -

&gt; I have written it all down in: http://www.hrps_dot_demon.nl/jwbus/T2-tires.htm
&gt;

I thought that web page was one of the most informative I have seen
regarding tires. I remember reading it weeks ago when I became a list
member.

I don't know if you got the answer to your question, though - why all the
math? The above web page alludes to it.

The tire diameter is the last equation in a car's overall gearing. The
taller (in diameter) the tire, the lower RPM needed for a given speed. The
smaller diameter tire will give you more pulling power.

You can sometimes experiment a bit for your particular driving conditions.
For instance, if you live in a relatively flat area and carry a light load,
you might want to try taller tire to cruise at an extra 1-4 mph with the
same RPM as before. Conversely, if you haul a bunch of stuff up hills, you
might try, say, a &quot;60&quot; series tire (with proper load range, etc..) to
tighten up the overall gearing a bit.

The difference between a 205/75 and a 185/60 is almost 15% (9mph_at_60mph!), so
there's some room to play with.
