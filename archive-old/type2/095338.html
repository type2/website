Subject: battery isolator

Hola,

Someone posted a link to their site with a VERY tricked out vanagon westy 
last week, solar panels and bikes mounted to the front/etc.

Anyway, they were using a battery isolated made by purepower or surepower, I 
forget which. I went to find one of these and it mentions something about 
Bosch alt and needing a specific kind of one. It of course did not say if it 
was that one or not. Anyone using a battery isolator, and if so, what 
band/model? From what I found, I think they sell that pure/surepower one at 
most auto parts stores, so someone here probably has one.

Thanks,
Christopher
