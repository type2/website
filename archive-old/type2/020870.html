Yeah, the numbers between the two compression tests are close, but what
about the variation of 40 psi between the lowest and the highest
readings in both tests?  I guess that's really what I'm concerned with,
and given that the motor's out I can be proactive before something goes
sour.  What bad can come by running an engine with such varied
compression readings?

And I searched over the Weber Progressive that came on the bus, and have
found what I think is the proper (carb) vacuum connection to run a vac
dizzy.  Now which dizzy should I run?  Does the amount of vacuum between
carburetors differ greatly?  In other words, do I need to check vacuum
pull specifications for the carburetor through the working rpm range
against the advance characteristics of a dizzy to get the right
combination between the two?

Thanks

&gt; First, adjust the valves!! The numbers are so close to the last readings that
&gt; it could be the difference in the guage or (more likely) the battery
&gt; condition.
&gt; Second, Pitch the 009 into the trash. Forget about 050! You need vacuum
&gt; advance, stock woud be best, but any vac advance for a type 4 would be better
&gt; than what you have now.
&gt; Of course, then you have to hook it up to the right place(s). Find a
&gt; distributor first.
