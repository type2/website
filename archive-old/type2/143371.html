&gt; If the panel is too short, one &quot;should&quot; be able to weld-on an extension. 
&gt; The
&gt; trick is to make an offset in the extension, so that the upper surfaces
&gt; remain
&gt; flush.  In other words, you have a lap seam with the overlap toward the
&gt; inside
&gt; of the Bus.  Tools for making such an offset are generally available...
just
&gt; can't recall at the moment, but I would start with autobody tool sites,
&gt; maybe
&gt; rust panel sites, even try Horrible Freight....  Glenn

&gt;    Try the Eastwood Company...They've got flangers for panels and a pair
of Vise-Grips with flanged jaws....
