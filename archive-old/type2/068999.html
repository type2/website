I know that Walter Miller in NY sells automotive lit. They 
advertise in Hemmings, sorry don't have their info close at 
hand.

&gt; 
&gt; I'm looking for a place that has out-of-print / hard to 
find owners 
&gt; manuals.  Not only for VW but also for (specifically) a 
'76 BMW 2002.
&gt; Are there businesses like this or will I need to just go 
junkyard hoping?
