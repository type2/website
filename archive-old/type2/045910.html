Subject: [T2] spare key

A few months ago, having lost the key to the bus, I pulled a door handle and
took it to have a new key made from it. Turned out the key opened all the
doors like a charm, but wouldn't start the bus. Luckily, the old key turned
up
and I compared them. The key made from the handle was missing one crucial
cut, so I can store this key (in an unmentioned place!:) if I ever lock the
keys in accidentally---and if found by a person of devious behavior, they
may get in, but they can't take her anywhere (unless they know how to
hotwire...and most joy-riders don't know how)
                          FWIW
