&gt; My mirror on the driver side is already busted off, and theirs rust
&gt; under the passenger side mirror.  So I was thinking to maybe mount the
&gt; mirrors on the pillars instead of on the doors themselves. That way they
&gt; would be a little more forward, and theirfore require less 'eye' time

but wouldn't you also hit them with the door when you opened it??
