It's easy:park your Westy in the direct sun on a 90+ degree afternoon and
pop the roof and begin to remove your old canvas. My God they staple that
stuff on there very well! To make it harder, I am trying to remove the old
stuff without tearing it up ( I may still make my own, using the old as a
pattern) but it is so dry rotted just barely touching it rips it. After
about two hours I finally go it off, as well as the luggage rack section,
and had sweated off at least 5 lbs. in the heat. This weekend the pop top
section comes off, then its on to some serious sanding and a spray of Dupont
Velvaseal then the top coat color, but that's still a couple of weeks away.
My Westy is now sitting in boxes all over my basement and garage-geez, I
hope I can remember how to put it all back together!
