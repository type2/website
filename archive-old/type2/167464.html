Subject: RE: Help!  For anyone with Hankook tires on a Vanagon/Bubble
  Bus

Bill,

There's another consideration as well.  I put a set of these on my 80
Westy, and the handling got definitely squirrely on the highway, relative
to the Michelins I had been running.  With every side gust, it felt like
the bus was going over.  You might not like the effect.  I don't think I'd
put another set on there now.

Also, one of them came apart on me on the highway with quite a bit of
tread left, say, a half inch.  It could just have been a bad tire since
it hasn't happened again on any of the others.

&gt; I'm trying to decide on the purchase from the Bus Depot of a set of Hankook
&gt; RA-08 195 series (not the 185's) tires for my '87 Vanagon Westy.  Perhaps -
&gt; OKAY! - I'm definitely getting anal about this.  I'm hoping that the outer
&gt; tire diameter of the 195 series Hankook's is a bit bigger/taller than the
&gt; Michelin MXL 205/70R14&quot; tires currently on my Carat alloys.
