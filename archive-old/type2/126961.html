 &gt;&gt;I'm all ready to go, got cherries packed, clothes,
camping gear, etc. Call John B. for directions to his
house where we are to meet AND FIND OUT EB IS
NOT UNTIL NEXT WEEK&lt;&lt;

This happened on Wednesday, so of course the next day,
I had to call Ted about 10:00 am on Thursday and
exclaim: &quot;Teddy, where the hell are you? We've been
waiting here for you to leave for EB since 8:00 this morning!!
