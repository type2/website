&gt; I'm splitting a junkyard 2.0 L case. All the bolts are out. (Yes, even

I know you said all the fasteners are out, but first make super extra double
sure, because it is really easy to miss one, especially on a dirty case, and
if one is still on there, the case won't split at all, not even much of a
crack. The permatex shouldn't be gluing the case together, it is very
brittle once it has cured and should split easily.

I like the two hammers method, two soft face hammers, one in each hand, pick
two good spots on the rear of the case and gently hit them at the same time.
You can do it on the front of the case as well. Take your time.
