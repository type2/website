Subject: Yet Another Smog Story

So we took the Guac down for a smog check today. Failed on CO: 3.16% and
allowed is 3.00%. We pull around to the parking lot, turn the mixture screw
2 turns, and get back in line. CO: 1.06% LOL!

Pulled back into the parking lot, turned the screw back to where it was, and
drove merrily to the DMV.

After waiting at the DMV for a while, we finally get called up. After going
through all the paperwork and everything, the lady says I can't register in
that county because I live in a different county! ARRRGGHHH!!!
