Hello, type2 listers..=20
  I have followed some of the discussion on painting, especially =
comments by professionals, and I am all pumped up and ready to buy an =
HVLP painting system! I have a big, rusty horse trailer (1947 Hoger) in =
surprisingly good condition, but needs painting or it will be lost in a =
few years. Also have a few other vehicles that badly need painting. Two =
will be sold soon.. old trucks. They could hardly look worse than they =
do now, and not worth having painted professionally, even discount. =
They'd make good practice for me and the effort will be repaid in the =
price realized. I was reading some tips posted on a site recommended by =
a lister, and the HVLP system sounds perfect for my needs.. happily also =
the state-of-the-art way of being environment friendly and doing a nice =
job, too. It looks like these systems go for around $600 to $800, and =
they are very compact. Can you make any other recommendations regarding =
the relative quality of different brands? Are systems now much better =
than older, used ones? Any other comments or tips?=20
Thanks in advance! Jan B
