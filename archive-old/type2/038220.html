&gt;Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;      I was fixing a split cv boot.  I found some wear on the joints but I
&gt;do not know what is acceptable.  I thought the balls would snap into the
&gt;middle cage.  Most of mine just fall out.  There are shiny spots on the
&gt;outside of the cage but you can't feel them with your fingernail.  There are
&gt;wear spots on the outside part of the joint where the balls ride.  These you
&gt;can feel.  Interesting thing,  one of the circle clips that hold the shaft
&gt;to the inner part of the cv was not there.  I looked for it in the greasy
&gt;flange but it wasn't there either.  Someone had to put it together that way.
&gt;Any insight  would be appreciated.

Pat, sounds fine.  I run REAL ugly CV's all the time.  Falling out of the
cage is not to be worried about, minor wear that catches a finger on the
races is fine, I begin to draw the line at ugly smeared galled metal, but
even then just usualy reverse their direction.  I don't typically toss a CV
till it has wear on the balls, or ugly galling on more than 2 tracks on either
inner or outer race, or is actually making noise.

That is me, I've run CV's that would terrify most for 50k beyond ugly before
I broke down to replace them.  But I am prepared to change one in the dark
on the road, I always carry a greased spare.  They are relatively cheap from
Bus Depot, and they will stop you cold.  A little bright dip in a couple of
tracks
on a race is NO reason to change them.  Reversing them is a great trick, axle
to axle, changes the contact path that is being worn, I do that every time I
regrease a set, maybe every 25k or so.

John
