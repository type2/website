If the dust boots are intact and the car is not sitting in a pond, leaving
it unattended should be no problem, at least insofar as lubrication is
concerned. This doesn't mean that you don't have a squeaking ball joint or
some other front end component. Keep in mind that the stuff that moves up
and down is at the outside of the suspension - this makes isolating the
source of the noise a bit easier. If you can duplicate the squeak by
bouncing the van up and down in place you can usually put a &quot;listening
stick&quot; up against various parts of the suspension and find the source that
way.

&gt; I have a general question, I hope it isn't inappropriate for this venue.
&gt; My bus, a `74 transporter with a safare camper aftermarket
&gt; package, had begun
&gt; to intermintently sqeak while driving. The sound is with almost no doubt
&gt; coming from my front end, and happens only when straight on with
&gt; the wheel, it
&gt; seems to have been sparked by some bumpy asphalt. My brakes are
&gt; solid, the
&gt; steering has had no apparent change in feel. I've looked at my
&gt; grease fitting
&gt; thinking I'd give them a going over, it has been at least two
&gt; years since I
&gt; greased them. The bus sat for a year, I didn't think it was
&gt; neglect to not
&gt; grease the sitting vehicle. Tell me if I'm wrong.  Does anyone
&gt; have an answer
&gt; for me? Please email me directly.
