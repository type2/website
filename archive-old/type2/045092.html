Subject: Re: [T2] Blue Wire to Alternator

The blue wire from the alternator warning lamp connects to the D+ terminal of
the regulator.

Keep smiling,

&gt; My dash alternator light has never worked. I assumed it might have something
&gt; to do with the blue wire that comes out of the right rear wire cluster below
&gt; the regulator. The wire was cut and now just dangles. Is this the wire that
&gt; controls the dash light?If so, where does it connect to?
