Subject: Cleaning Type 4 oil Cooler
Content-Disposition: Inline

Hi all
Is there any satisfactory way to clean a Type 4 oil cooler? I have 3 or
4 that look like there is just dirty oil inside but Bentley says
 to replace cooler if any filings etc are found in engine. Tthe cooler
is downstream of the filter so HAS to be cean but I have serious $
problems with a new cooler, especially when I have 3 - 4!
All help appreciated.
