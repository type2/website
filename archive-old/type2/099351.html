Subject: Wiring Diagrams for 74 bus..What the..?

Ok, I took off the the top plate to the dash board to inspect the wiring in 
my 74 bus, manufactured August '73. Well, I checked it with my Bentley, and 
it doesn't appear to be wired that way.

So....I skipped over to Type2_dot_com, to check their wiring diagrams...There are 
3 that my van falls into. 1)73-75 models, 2) 74 1800, 3) 74 ....I hope I can 
figure this out...
