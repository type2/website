Subject: Trip Report - Pt 2 little long

12/26 - Woke up pretty groggy and with a five hundred mile hangover and sore 
gas pedal ass thinking about the red light and the woe it usually brings - I 
mean the right hand red light, the one with the oil
can on it, that’s the one that when it comes on at speed your’re supposed to 
take the key out, put it in neutral, grab the grab handles and close your 
eyes and scream, but I didn’t do that in front of my wife, I gunned it once 
and as I did the light winked out but came right back on so I turned the 
motor off and coasted to the Sleep Inn. Tired we checked into the room then I 
ran back out to scope the motor. I was hotter now for sure and the dipstick 
was pretty damn hot but not as bad as others have been. with some smoke 
coming out the vents. But this had been happening from the right side earlier 
in the day which I was positive was from the leaky valve cover dripping 
lighter multiweight onto the boiling heater box in frigid weather. It had 
been zero when I left and about the low 20s now. I took my coveralls in from 
under
the busbed, heated them on radiator. Christine was coming down with 
something, so I got us breakfast from the food and coffee pantry down the 
hall., went out and checked the belt which had loosened a bit but didn’t have 
the appearance that it was slipping. The oil was back at the bottom line - 
okay through in 
a little, all wires and all four plugs connected, fuel line intact. Drained 
the oil and found metal shavings. Hate to see that. Well, something is not 
good, but I decided to put in fresh oil, get in turn the key and start it up, 
both lights came on and went out. ran nice, warmed up then I pulled back on 
the carb and heard it missing, not smooth. Rechecked the idiots light both 
out, check the timing mostly because I have the thing and its something to do 
to make you feel like something happened. So I get in and start driving it 
around the hotel complex, like 3 or 4 motels all surrounding each other, with 
ramps and parking lots good for getting it up to 2nd and in one spot to 3rd - 
still nobody around except this older outdoor maintanence guy, who came over 
after awhile and said ‘having trouble, eh?’ and so I gave him the most benign 
description of what happened I can conjure. Meanwhile I conclude that 
something is wrong with the bus, but it seemed to drive around the parking 
lot okay, maybe I should take a compression test and find out if I can get 
back on the highway? Compression test - The coucil waits for you. But it’s 
not in toolbox - forgotten at home so now a little disgusted I find the 
phonebook call Autozone yes they  have one I get directions it’s ‘just in 
town’. I tell Christine of my plan and depart but find out that now I’m on 
route 264
a secondary road that actually is pretty long. Town isn’t in site, I’m 
actually passing an airport, I get to fourth put it in realize that it’s not 
going to make it to the other autozone, but was going to conk out in this 
autozone so I try to find a place to pull a u-turn then rule that out as the 
oil light comes on and expensive noises start, I pull it over and turn it 
off. I’m just around an extremely busy right turn with multiple lights. I try 
pushing it off into the dirt but keep hitting the curb. A kind stranger 
appears at my side and up it goes. I thank him and write a ‘be right back’ 
note set off to find a phonebook and phone, call a 24 hour tow. The driver 
says the best place to go in the area for VW parts and service is Bunn &amp; Son 
at the next exit. Good to know I thank him and this time ask him to unhitch 
me behind the motel because I was going to be keeping a low profile. He put 
me next to a motorcycle also with new york plates and we were the only 
vehicles on the back side of the building at that time of just past noon. The 
motor was cooked. Called Bunn &amp; Son a few times but it just rang they weren’t 
around on a Sunday. I called all the places that were open. I got it in my 
head that I needed a longblock to solve this problem quickly enough to 
continue the journey. I needed to find one and I needed a way to get it to 
me. My friend Tony who drives a 90 vanagon in Minnesota was heading to 
florida as well, but first had brought his family somewhere in North Carolina 
for the holidays, then would fly down and meet us. He’d left a message on my 
machine giving me his mothers cell phone number, to meet him at the show. I 
try calling and leave a message but it’s no dice. I call my landlord and ask 
him to go in my apmt and read the caller id back to his call and give me that 
number. after some more prodding he does it and when I call there he is on 
the other end in Durham which is not too far away, maybe 60 miles he is 
renting a minivan for wife and kids while there. Yes he will help with 
delivery if possible! Next I pull out some AIRS members names I pulled
off the list for area. All I have is VA and a couple SC and FLA - a good 
amount. What I want is to post a message to see if anyone has a good used 
longblock in the area. I see Jon Dawson’s name on there and call him up in 
Richmond and he goes right on the internet and posts a message for me 
requesting a longblock if there was one around - thanks alot Jon! so now I 
choose from the 3 fast food places that surround me, bring it home to the 
room and have a sit down. some talk. I decide I’m going to try and buy a 
longblock on Monday morning if I can find one. the phone rings and I get a 
call from Bill Divers offering help and some suggestions about places I might 
find motors in Raliegh and Durham. Mechanics were recommended as well. I got 
a call from Charlie Ford who gave me a great list of AIRS members in the 
state, as well as mechanics and the two longblock sources.  I really 
appreciate the help and response I got from the AIRS list. So armed with this 
knowledge I went outside and quietly removed the motor and stripped the motor 
down to the longblock in the last two hours before sunset, left the wheels 
blocked in neutral with the scissor jack under the tranny. People have been 
pulling in through the afternoon and the parking lot was beginning to fill 
up. my coveralls were covered in that black grease that doesn’t come off, my 
goggles gave the impression of a biosphere project escapee, and despite my 
efforts to blend in, I was probably noticed. Anyway things were looking good 
if I could get an engine the next morning!
