&gt; I notice two different opinions on slicking down the rubber bushings
for
&gt; the rear torsion bar/spring plate connection.  I seek additional
&gt; guidance.
&gt; 
&gt; Bentley says: &quot;Coat the inner &amp; outer rubber bushing with talcum
powder
&gt; only.

I used talcum powder, mostly because it was available.  It worked fine.

&gt; Just Kampers says: (on a different topic, but still appropriate ) Do
not
&gt; use normal liquid detergent for a lubricant on the window rubbers,
&gt; because most of these products contain SALT!! (my paraphrase)
&gt; 
&gt; My question:  How would it be if I used mineral oil (specifically,
&gt; Johnson &amp; Johnson Baby Oil).  Since it is not petroleum based, would
&gt; this work fine??

Mineral oil is petroleum based!

  And how about vegetable or other type of cooking oil??
&gt; 
&gt; I will go the talcum route, but I just wanted other technical
opinions.

Talcum is available, cheap, works, and seems to be what VW had in mind.

&gt; On installation of the spring plate rubber bushes, 
&gt; 
&gt; Bentley say: 1 install inner rubber bushing, 2 install spring plate &amp;
&gt; adjust torsion bar, 3 install outer bushing. 
&gt; 
&gt; Haynes says 1 &quot;Having reset the torsion bar so that the plate angle is
&gt; correct, make sure the rubber bushes are in good condition.  Renew
if in
&gt; doubt.&quot;  This means that I first adjust the angle, then removing and
&gt; replacing the spring plate to replace the rubber bushes.
&gt; 
&gt; Is it that difficult to work with new rubber bushings?  Does the inner
&gt; bushing HAVE to be on the spring plate to get the proper angle?

No, and No.

The angle is determined by the splines while the bushings locate the
torsion bar in the vertical plane.  If the whole bar moves up and down
a bit it won't have any effect on the spring plate angle.  I've had no
problem working with new bushings.
