Ladies, Gentlemen, (and the rest of you, too :-)

I think the tax deduction thread is reaching the point of diminishing
returns.  Tax laws vary world-wide.  What works for one will not work for
others, and the best thing to do if it interested you is to inquire
locally.  While making buses cheaper to own is definitely on topic, tax
law quickly gets arcane beyond belief, and that's just in any one country.
