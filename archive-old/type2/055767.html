Subject: RE: loaf layout idea

Dave (and other interested parties),
You may be interested in the layout of my bus.  I think it's great but I
haven't seen any others the same.
I have a stove behind the passenger seat in the same place as the Westy
sink.  This swivels out so you can cook outside or can be removed
entirely.  Alongside this is a bench seat that flips over to face either
way and slides on rails back and forth.  This gives you the advantage of
having a standard 6/7 seat layout with walkthrough right to the back
when not camping.  The middle seat can be removed just like the drivers
seat.  The base of the seat is a wooden box which is used for storage.
It wouldn't be difficult to fabricate the mechanism, which is simpler
than the z-bed arrangement.  The hardest part would be making the rails
to weld to the floor.  I could measure it sometime if anyone wants to
make one.
