Subject: potentiometer

quick question because the reason for asking is too long to go into, can the
potentiometer be adjusted back to the stock position if for some reason or
another a shop thought to be reputable had &quot;adjusted&quot; it?  i guess better
late than never since Goethe is in the same shop as they, on their dime,
reset the potentiometer.  this is the FI on a '75 ED engine.

TIA,

jeremiah and Goethe the two tone bullet (brick)
