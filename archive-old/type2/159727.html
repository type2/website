&gt; Anyone have recommendations as to a shop in the San Pedro/Long Beach

Hey Steve,
I'd highly recommend Tom from TNT Automotive.  He's a great guy and does 
great work.  He's located in Long Beach, right by PCH and Redondo.  His 
phone number is (562) 439-6720.  He does all the work on my bus that I 
don't do myself and is very straightforward and honest.

Mike
