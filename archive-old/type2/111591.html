OK. It appears that the mech did a hack job on Alice, but enough about
that. I truly believe there is a vacuum leak between the engine and
the brake booster. Just go out unplug the booster line and plug the
vacuum hose bibb. Then see what happens. only take 10 minutes, and I
suspect you will see a huge improvement.
