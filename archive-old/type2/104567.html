&gt; From your previous message, you say you have a carb? What happened to your
&gt; fuel injection?
&gt; If you had FI, you would have a rubber hose going from the tank to the drivers
&gt; side frame rail. There are 2
&gt; plastic clips mounted to the floor for the hose to sit in.
&gt; The 7.5mm hose goes to the filter, then a short piece of 10mm hose connects
&gt; between the filter and the FI
&gt; pump. Then a short piece of 7.5 hose goes between the pump and the metal fuel
&gt; rail connected to the 3/4
&gt; injectors.
&gt; If you have a modified fuel system, no one can tell you what you have unless
&gt; they see it....

My FI bus has two more pieces:

* This metal piece from the tank to the filter...

* This metal piece that goes after the pump. It connects to a very short
piece of hose that connects to the 1/2 fuel rail which protrudes through the
firewall.
