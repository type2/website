Subject: [T2] (T2) Patterns for Interior Panels for 71 Westy

Listies I've got a 71 Westy that I'm using for a daily driver.  The paneling
is in pretty sorry shape both in fit and condition (originals were replaced
by PO). I would like to be able to create the interior panels without using
the old one as templates.  Does anyone know of a place where I can get a set
of templates?

Thanks for the help, Paul
