&gt;LOL.  Certain Maaco franchises have the reputation of being fairly contientous and careful even with the ridiculously low $200 &gt;(or
whatever it is now) price.  Others are known to do a really sloppy job.

Unannounced visits to the shop to inspect the current day's production
give you a real good idea of what to expect.  A conversation with the best
painter ( and a $20 ) might prove valuable in returns.
