There's no such thing as &quot;the Volkswagen horn sound&quot;.
They used generic single-tone horns, AFAICT from a variety
of manufacturers even, and the ones I've heard sound all
differently.

Maybe all that Detroit iron sounds markedly different,
that I couldn't say, but compared to German contemporary
cars, Volkswagens don't honk any differently.

Airhowlingly yours,
