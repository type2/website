Subject: header tape

My experience with header tape is not good. I found that the exhaust tape
DID hold the heat in, but the exhaust pipe rotted from the inside out. The
wrap tends to hold water. FWIW

&gt; I was going to do the same (wrap my pipes) until an old racer warned me of
&gt; the potential damage it could/would do to the steel. It was just that I
got
&gt; excited b/c I knew something that I wanted to share with you. It does make
&gt; power but it leads to periodical pipe replacement. I guess it just depends
&gt; on what you use your vehicle for. I'm always lacking cash for replacement
&gt; pipes or spares...
