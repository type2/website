Hope this helps, Mike.  Go Ruptured Duck!

&gt; Hiya All,
&gt; 
&gt; Just got a surprise call from my painter and I have to meet with him
&gt; after work today to discuss paint codes.  So...........  I have a white
&gt; over beige 1970 Bus.  The beige is Savannah Beige and I think the code
&gt; for that color is L620.  The white is Wolkenweiss (I think that translates
&gt; to Cloud White) but I do not have the code for that color.
