Subject: 1974 Westy main cabin lamp

First I'd like to thank all who helped me with my search for the fuse for the &quot;house loads&quot;.  It was located on the positive lead to the AUX batt.  To my surprise the reefer and DiHydrogen Oxide pump work, however, the fluorescent lamp is still inop.  I got 12.37vdc on the leads and replaced the bulb but still no worky.  I checked for continuity on the circuit board components and found all ok except for a blue, round component I think may be a capacitor.  Does anyone know for sure? Or does anyone know where one may purchase,barter, or otherwise procure the entire assembly?
                             Thanks in advance,
                              Denny Weaver
