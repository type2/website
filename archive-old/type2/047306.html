Dear James.

I appreciate your dilema regarding lack of availability of genuine VW 
replacement heat exchangers and accept that for the present time, you may 
have to make the best of a bad job!

However, assuming your poor quality heat exchangers are made by Dansk, would 
you please send an e-mail complaining about your problems, to Martin 
Pedersen (e-mail: info_at_jpgroup.dk), managing director at Dansk Autopart A/S, 
in Denmark, so that does not remain blissfully ignorant of what is 
happening; sending a copy to me for my records.

Regards.
               Nigel A. skeet
