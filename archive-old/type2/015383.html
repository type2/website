&gt;How did China Cat's clutch plate end up glazed (apparently oily in there
too) 
&gt;when there is no oil on the flywheel or the pressure plate?
&gt;

Could it be the PO just put in a new seal and reused the clutch? All the
Ficktel and Sachs German clutch parts I've seen are dated on each part, the
disk and clutch anyway.  Or was it a NAPA clutch??

&gt;I have read of soaking these in lacquer thinner and resurfacing them with a 
&gt;grinder. I hate to toss itk, as it is nearly unwarn, aside from the glaze. 
&gt;The archives even tells of a lad who soaked his in gasoline and set it 
&gt;afire...numerous times.

Burning it in effigy can be done in several ways.

Drive it carefully up to a big tree and rest the front bumper against it.
Rev the motor and dump the clutch in first. See that big cloud of smoke???
That's the oil burning out of the friction fabric from the intense heat. It
will seem to work better for a few days or even weeks, but you also burn up
the adhesive matrix and fresh oil comes around too soon. Replace the seal,
have the flywheel ground, put in a new disk, clutch, t.o. and pilot
bearing. And don't forget to check for wear of the cross shaft fingers and
bearings. If anyone heated the clutch up enough to heat stress the surface,
those springs all got very hot and some of them will be weak. Makes for
very poor, short life function. 

&gt;
&gt;Any way to save the clutch plate?

Could be used as a discus in a competition for the kids of all ages at a VW
meet. CV put, anyone?

Sorry, Don, but it appears you bought a bus from a PO who fixed it up so he
could sell it. Join the club. 

Fix it right and be done with clutch probs for a long long time. Use German
parts if you can get them. Mexican parts are trash in comparison. Even the
disks assembled in Mexico of genuine German steel parts have misformed
rivits with perfectly drilled and deburred holes done in Germany. The
Latinos can't seem to keep their presses in spec or care to inspect the
parts. The last cross shaft I saw from Mexico was unusable in new
condition. Obviously not jig welded and very poorly stamped fingers. Half
of any HS shop class could do as good or better by hand with mild steel.

It took the Japanese some 25 years to start putting out some quality
products after the WWII. I suspect the Mexicans will get there too. They
just have need of a few more years of practice and feedback from the buyers
and non-buyers for incentive to improve.
