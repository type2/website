Subject: Re: [T2] upper to lower brake resevoir connection/seal

Hiya Steve,

I ran into this little problem on my 70.  Those boots were just so much gunk 
after I got them off.  I could not find them for the life of me.  
So..........I went with a whole new hose from the upper reservior to the 
lower.  It worked great.  If you need the specs on the hose P-mail me and 
I'll zap the info to you.

Meanwhile I'm still trying to get that *&amp;^%^_at_^%$ vent window and frame out.  
Looks like I'm gonna have to get the window out of there before I can remove 
this thing.  I sure would like to know how the guys who wrote the manuals did 
this!
