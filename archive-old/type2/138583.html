Subject: Re: [T2] winterizing a bus :)

What's funny is at least we can drive our busses here without smog testing
them,
and all that hardship.

And it costs me $200 a year (canadian $ = about 50$ US ;) ) to drive for
insurance and plates. :P

But back to the original reason for the post.. anyone know what I should do?

James
Canadian 74 Westie and 78 partso bus.

&gt; &gt; Drive it to Cali and hang here for the winter! We really don't mind
&gt; &gt; having more busses around!!!
&gt;
&gt; don't forget to change the anti-freeze
