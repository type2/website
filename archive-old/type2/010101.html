I suppose this idea of using a Westy as a &quot;dinghy&quot; for a monster
motorhome is no more ridiculous than towing a 1999 Explorer or Cherokee
as a &quot;dinghy&quot;.  We see combos like that all the time on I-5 in Western
Washington.

It's not really your problem if the guy buys your bus, but I'd think
really hard about towing it on the drive wheels for any distance (like,
say, across the USA and back).

&gt;Hey Everybody,
&gt;
&gt;There is a gentleman who is considering buying my 71 Weekender. He 
&gt;wants to
&gt;tow it behind his motor home when he and his wife travel. He says he 
&gt;needs
&gt;to know the weight of the bus without passengers and cargo. He also 
&gt;needs to
&gt;know, and he is researching this too, if the tow bar is capable of 
&gt;towing
&gt;the bus. He checked the tire size (195 R14) to see if it will fit the 
&gt;tow
&gt;bar. Has anyone trailed a bus before? Has weight been a factor? Is a
&gt;hardtop Westy even capable of being towed long distances? Is the frame 
&gt;and
&gt;front end strong enough? What other things should be taken into
&gt;consideration? Any help in this matter would be greatly appreciated.
&gt;
