Subject: caught seat belt in steering wheel-horn blows!

While visiting a fellow listee last weekend, I had a freak occurrence-
while putting on my seatbelt AND turning the car I managed to catch the
belt around the shift lever and get the belt twisted into the space
above the shift lever housing collar.  Very embarrassing- in the middle
of the street we had to remove the seatbelt bolt to get this untangled.
Since then, I had to remove the horn wire because it will blow when I
turn the wheel to  one side; also the signal lever &quot;sticks&quot; sometimes.
I thought the horn wire comes up inside the steering tube to the horn
button ring that grounds this wire to the steering &quot;tube&quot; when you hit
the button- so why would this be affected by what happened to the turn
signal collar?    78 Westy  221,000 mi original engine....
