&gt;Sorry, please excuse me for not including Electricians.  Electricians may 
&gt;even have a better grasp of automotive electronics than some EE's.
&gt;
&gt;I haven't heard from any EE's on the list, by the way.  At the risk of 
&gt;sounding ignorant, who is Beckett???  I know of books written or published 
&gt;by Beckett, but I just want to make sure Beckett isn't a list 
&gt;member.  There are some comments in the e-mail sent out the other day, 
&gt;credited to Beckett, that has some really bad advice in it.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;

&gt; &gt;As an ex-Navy Electrician I enjoy these discussions and usually find myself

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Fire away. I might even remember a few things I want to ask before it is
&gt; &gt;all over. Just keep the subject lines concise and to the point (accurate)
&gt; &gt;so I can save any good messages.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;(I've forgotten alot of info in the past 6 years!!! Not much left when I
&gt; &gt;figure how little I think I really knew well.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;There are a lot of misconceptions, old wive's tales, tall stories, etc. on
&gt; &gt;&gt;electricity in general.  It would be nice to clear things up a bit.
