Hi Frank,

I'm no expert, but I'd suggest that the first thing to look at would be your 
carb's jets. Sounds a lot like a blocked idle jet, if it's that, the engine 
will run OK while the revs are up a little, but stall when it drops to idle 
(sound about right?). I've had that with a few old cars (VW &amp; other), and it 
was fixed by cleaning out the jets.

Other than that, if your idle screw is set too low, the revs will drop below 
stall speed, hence stalling. Doubt that it's that, though, as the choke should 
kick up your idle speed when the engine's cold.

Good luck,

Neale

&gt; Hello All,
&gt; A few questions for the experts!  71 Westy, dies at stop.  Doesn't
&gt; matter, warm or cold.  Timing, points, valves etc adjusted or replaced
&gt; 500 miles ago. Looking for hints as to what to investigate.
&gt; Many thanx!
&gt; Frank
&gt; 71 Happy Bus
&gt;
