Subject: Alloy rims and drum screws

I finally was going to get the CSS snowflake rims I've been waiting to use
mounted with the Vredsteins that I picked up from Troy's yesterday. The rims
came off a 71 bus so I knew the bolt pattern was correct, and the offset
would be close if not perfect.

But before heading to the tire shop I decided to test fit one to the rear.
::rockrockrock:: It didn't set flat against the drum. Hmm.... A little
exploration shows the two drum screws are preventing the rim from setting
where it should be..

My question is: Did the 71 drums not have those screws?

And yes, you know I thought about removing the screws and using the rim to
hold the drum in place. heh
