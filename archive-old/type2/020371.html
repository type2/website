I'm back! Well, I was never quite gone....
http://home.earthlink_dot_net/~shrike3/parts/nixyard.html

I've signed up with PayPal, which facilitates SECURE credit card
ordering and I think will make sales to Canada more convenient. The
access button is at the bottom of the page.

I've got a couple more sets of 73-74 heat exchangers.

Now for the part I really hate:

Sellers, be sure to get payment up front from Kevin Winter
(thebus82_at_yahoo_dot_com). I sent him parts on September 11. He hasn't paid
up and he's not answering my e-mails.

And my other old cat died: http://home.earthlink_dot_net/~shrike3/wally.html
That's been my sole focus for the past two months.

Nikki
