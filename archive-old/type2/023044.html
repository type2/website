I was wondering how long it would take the truth to come out.  At least I 
might have had people believing my bus was fast for a day or two.  :)  I do 
have the Dellorto DRLA 40's on there now instead of the stock duals when I 
raced you but it's still pretty slow.  Someday I would like to remove the 
spare batteries, fridge, tools and other heavy stuff and see how much it 
picks up.

When I get time to build my TDI-powered 140hp 30+mpg bus, things will be 
different!

And yes, &quot;bracket racing&quot; wins are achieved by predicting your elapsed time 
and getting as close as possible without going under, combined with good 
reaction time.  You can win a bracket race with any vehicle, even a 
bus.  Automatic transmissions have an advantage since shifts are usually 
more consistent.

&gt;David, you just got lucky and caught me with my RPM down!  And let's 
&gt;clarify:
&gt;it was YOUR first and second gear you got through - I had just shifted to
&gt;second (at 33 mph) where my power really comes on.  And when I hit 3rd at 55
&gt;mph, watch out!
