Subject: ADMIN List Mood (was Re: [T2] Type 4 Thermostat)

Yeah, what is going on lately?  The signal-to-noise ratio has gone down 
quite a bit.  All this hostility is going to do is drive a stake through 
the heart of the greatest bus resource on the planet.  Dave Raistrick and 
the other admins will tire of hosting a forum for people to tear each other 
down and the list will go away.  Please think about what it is that you 
want from this list, and then contribute more of the same or take it to 
USENET (a.k.a. rec.autos.vw).  Here's some advice from yours truly who has 
been on this list or one of its predecessors for almost eight 
years:  Choose your words carefully and remember that the guy or gal on the 
other end is a fellow bus driver.  State your opinion once and then let it 
go.  Don't post when you're angry - go have a beer, go to bed, come back 
the next day and ask yourself if it's really worth starting a war over.

Thanks everyone,

-David
  (type2 List administrator)

p.s.  Replies to this thread should be sent directly to me 
(schwarze_at_ev1_dot_net) or one of the other admins, not the list.
