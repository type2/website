Subject: RE: [T2] CHEEP BUSES

The initial cost of putting a bus on the road will pay off in the long run,
IF you do it right.
I paid $1000 for my 72 bus back in 81, put another $1700 (which probable
with inflation equates to $5000 today) into  paint, engine and rebuilt
trany.
75000 miles later and I only had to replace the brake master cylinder and
booster in the last year with the usual change the oil, set valves, two sets
of points and plugs and feed it Gas. 
To me, that is a cheep bus and your right I'm hanging on to this bus!
