Subject: bus woes

Ok list heres a story for ya, I decided to have my stock carbs rebuilt on
my 74 westy. I took it to the local VW guy who I know does good work. He
priced it out at $200 not a bad price so I said go for it. That was a week
ago, and the final bill turned into $457 The carb rebuild was painless, it
was after the fact that hurt. He told me he couldnt get it running right,
it was running on three cylinders, and it wasnt charging. I finally got it
back Tuesday but once getting it home it would not start. So i push started
it and took it back. The mech was not happy to see it and so it sits. Found
out it needs a new voltage regulator. Still dont have the bus and we were
supposed to drive it to Las Vegas last Saturday, so much for my first road
trip in Pug.
