Subject: Odd tire wear, right rear tire.

While crawling around under my '71, I noted that the right rear tire was
wearing in a very odd fashion.

The inside edge was scalloped (cupped), but only for half the
circumference of the tire.

The center and outside edge of the tire was wearing satisfactorily.

Since half the tire was affected, I'd expect that this had something to do
with the brakes or bearings on that wheel.  I doubt it is alignment, as
the opposite tire is fine.

Pulled the tire and drum.  Nothing odd going on with the drum or brake
shoes.  Hard to check the bearings with the axle hooked up but they might
be a bit rumbly.

The left side wheel bearings went bad two years ago and were replaced.
The right side bearings are at least 8 years old and may be as old as the
bus.

  Play in the right hub was slight in the up-and-down direction
and nil in the side-to-side direction.  The opposite hub (bearings
replaced two years ago) had slight play in both up-and-down and
side-to-side directions.

Tires are Bridgestone 185R14,RD603, highway tread, load range D.  It
doesn't seem like a belt separation, as every belt separation I've seen
has been in the middle of the tread.

I suspect the bearings, but I thought I'd run it past the list before I
tore it further apart.

Has anyone here been down this path before?

George Lyle
