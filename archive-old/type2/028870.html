I was under the impression that the campers have the same metal mount
brackets on them as do the micros and kombis. In fact I believe that all the
chassis are the same. Therefore all you need are the original VW seat clamps
and bolts. Which of course we have, used. But if you are pulling the seats
from a bus then just take the ones that came with it. You obviously need to
remove the floor covering on your bus. They make a mat for the back that has
the cut outs for these seats. Grab that out of the junked bus if you can. If
not then we have those too.

&gt;Might take more time get the sink out of the bus than a second jump
&gt;seat in. There are only four bolts holding it to the floor. Drill
&gt;hole use big washers to back up the nuts under the bus and you should
&gt;be good to go.
