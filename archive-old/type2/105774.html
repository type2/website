Subject: RE: [T2] Engine stand

&gt; Does anyone have a disused one.  You know, just taking up space in the
&gt; garage or shed.  I have a floor stand, just need the 'hooks to
&gt; engine' part.

Go to your local salvage yard a pick up a bus bell housing.  Bolts right to
your stand, and if you're lucky and have the right size flywheel, you'll be
able to start and run the engine on the stand.
