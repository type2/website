Subject: Re: [T2] Emissions parts vs. non-Emissions

No, Ron. What you are describing is 1979 CALIF- ONLY.
Go to the 68-79 Bentley, section 5, page 15. Bottom right drawing is 79 Cal. The
79 heads are square port. That left side manifold will only fit on those heads.
On page 15 in the main pic [not the drawings] is the 75 to 78 system. Same as
what he should have and the your website drawing that I included.


&gt; &gt; &gt; I have a '78 camper and was wondering what was added to
&gt; &gt; California models
&gt; &gt; &gt; for emissions control.  I've seen a part for a catalytic
&gt; &gt; converter and I've
&gt; &gt; &gt; heard that the gas tank is different.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Two questions:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Can the converter be bolted onto the non-emissions exhaust?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Yes, it takes the place of the straight pipe between the U pipe
&gt; &gt; and the muffler.
&gt; &gt; Ron at Bus Depot has a drawing of it:
&gt; &gt; http://www.busdepot_dot_com/partsimages/exhaust27578.JPG
&gt; &gt; You should have #5. The cat takes it's place.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Yes, as the aforementioned diagram shows, you can add a catalytic converter
&gt; to the 49-state setup, simply by putting it in place of the straight pipe.
&gt;
&gt; However, while this would add a cat, it would not in fact make the setup
&gt; identical to that used in California.  There was a different layout in
&gt; California for '75-78, which used a smaller drivers-side heat exchanger with
&gt; the cat converter tucked along side of it (facing front to rear). The
&gt; crossover pipe was also different to accommodate this setup. The actual
&gt; California setup would require using that unique left side heat exchanger
&gt; (which we do carry but it isn't cheap) and the California-only crossover
&gt; pipe (which is no longer available).   I can't see any reason to switch to
&gt; that particular setup on a non-California bus, though.
