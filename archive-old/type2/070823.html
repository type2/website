Subject: V.W. Show in Kansas City this Weekend
Message-ID: &lt;a68c279a.24861038_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

  All you midwesterners don't forget that K.C. is the place to be this 
weekend.  Friday night before the Saturday show join us at the Argosy Casino 
for free food and drinks!  Camping sites at the park next to the Casino fell 
through due to flooding earlier which set ground work behind.  We will find a 
place for you to park your Westy, but it may have to be on asphalt!  No 
flooding now, the show Saturday will probably draw about 200 VWs to show and 
a huge swap meet (the largest in the midwest, with those good ole midwestern 
prices).  E-mail for more info. pinknewell_at_aol_dot_com or call evenings at 
816-587-2838.  Looking forward to seeing you all there!
