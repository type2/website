Yes it uses a one-year-only BUS upper front apron.

On the distributor, go here: http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com/ignition.htm
And scroll down. You will see beetle 72-73. Click on that. Look at the dist
#....113 905 205AN....now scroll down to 74.....oops quite a few different
choices then a 73.....now scroll down to 71 bus.....oops, it uses a 211
number, but below that it says 'can also use 043 905 205D...that is a 74 bug
Calif Auto stick dist. Good luck finding one!


&gt; I was recently given a '71 Campmobile that was stuffed
&gt; full of parts, including 3 engines. Unfortunately,
&gt; none of them were installed or running.
&gt; The one I decided to use had originally come from a
&gt; Beetle, I think - prefix number begins w/AH. That's
&gt; 73-74 according to the Wilson book, right?
&gt; Here's where it gets confusing:
&gt; The case has been drilled and correctly tapped for the
&gt; rear bus crossmember - fits, I checked. Bolts right up
&gt; to the bus. However, I'm at a loss as to shrouding. I
&gt; know some of it is the same, but I appear to be
&gt; missing a couple of pieces, including the one that
&gt; attaches to the front of the doghouse and seals to the
&gt; firewall. Also, I think I'm missing the airflaps that
&gt; the list seems to agree should ALWAYS be present.
&gt; So, what are the differences here? Can I use Beetle
&gt; sheet metal, or are there special bus pieces/pieces
&gt; for this year of bus?
&gt; Related Q: what type of Bosch dizzy does this year
&gt; engine use (assuming that I'm right and it is a
&gt; 73-74)?
