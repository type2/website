KR:
Mike Dwyer's warnings are well worth bearing in mind, but I have to say that
I love my freeway flyer. I used to cruise at 65, and can now cruise at 75.
Still, pay attention to the issues Mike notes. For example, the biggest
problem spot I have is shifting from third to fourth; in order to avoid
lugging the engine (and thus losing your cooling power) I now run out third
gear to a little higher RPM than I had in the past. It isn't a high rev, but
I am self-conscious about RPM in the 3-4 shift range. In addition, hilly
areas can be difficult, since the lowered RPM with the freeway flyer means
that when you start dropping speed in fourth, you will have to shift down to
third a bit earlier.

So the trade off is there. Rev higher in third to maintain engine RPM when
moving in and out of fourth, or sacrifice higher top speed and maintain
sufficient RPM for efficient cooling. I think that if I lived where there
are a lot of hills, or the freeways had noticable grades, I'd stay clear of
the freeway flyer. This is almost certainly a flatlanders tranny -- and I
love mine.

It takes a certain amount of energy, heat, to push the bus through the air
at
60 MPH.  The VW's cooling system is based upon engine speed.  Over size
tires, or a higher geared final drive ratio will cause the cooling fan to
turn slower and remove fewer BTUs from the engine at a given highway speed.
The bus will run hotter. And actually, you may not see an increase in fuel
economy as you may find it now takes a larger throttle opening to maintain
your speed.
