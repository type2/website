Subject: engine question

[Hi Listers,]
                 I have an engine that has been standing for about 6 months,
when I first took it out, I drained all the oil out of it then put in about
half a litre, as this is all that I had at the time, I have left it like
that for 6 months, obviously I will put more oil in before I fire it up, but
is there anything else that you think I should do before I turn it over?
