Is the flywheel off of the engine now?

I have seen a 1600 that wouldn't budge past a 1/8 turn until the flywheel
was on. It had to do with out-of-spec end play and the engine in question
had to be abandoned--it had already been cut twice. Had it not been cut
twice, I could have had it align bored again and put in oversize bearings,
so even if this is your problem, all may not be lost.

Good luck! Joe


&gt; Okay, I'm lazy, I'll admit it. The 2L 77 I bought has a stuck motor. Can
&gt; turn the engine over a quarter turn in each direction before it sticks
&gt; solid.
