+AD4-could get and send to me a SET of headlights

Do you get Volksworld magazine where you are? There's plenty of ads for UK
spec headlights, but aren't you just referring to the side lights which are
incorporated in the headlight unit?

Nobody actually drives on sides any more, though they used to one time.
Nowadays we only use them for parking. So what have you got for parking
lights?
