&gt; The difference between the Motor and Research octane numbers have to
&gt; do with the way the test is run.  The same test engine is used, but
&gt; the test parameters are changed to meet the standards for each type of
&gt; test.

The research octane test is conducted at 600RPM, with inlet
temperature at atmospheric and 13 degrees BTDC spark advance

The motor octane test is conducted at 900RPM, with 100F inlet
temperature and 14-26 degrees BTDC spark advance.

As you might suspect, the motor octane test is more severe and will
result in lower octane ratings than the research test due to the
greater intake temperature and spark advance.
