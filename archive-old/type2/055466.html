Subject: 6V to 12 volt gas gauge plans (long)

A few people responded to my post about a low-current voltage supply for
running a 6V gas gauge on a 12V system.  I've decided to post the plans
here on the list since I don't beleive in intellectual property.  Besides,
it's a simple emitter-follower circuit found in any first year electronics
textbook.  If you understand the following description, though, it's time
to be honest with yourself,you are a true nerd.

Here's what you do:(mind you there are about a thousand different ways to
do this, bu this is what I did, and it works)
Parts list:
1 330 ohm resistor
1 220 ohm resistor
1 MJE3055T Transistor or equivalent
1 male spade crimp connector
1 female spade crimp connector
1 screw-eye crimp connector (I forget the correct name for it)
some 16-18 AWG wire
a small piece of PC board
you chould be able to get most of this stuff at your local Radio Shanty but
if you're a nerd like me, you've been saving these things for years along
with aboout a thousand other things knowing that someday you'd need them.

One end of the 220 ohm resistor is soldered to the collector (C) of the
transistor together with a short (1-2&quot;) piece of wire that has the male
spade connector on it.  The  other end of the 220 ohm resistor is connected
to the base (B) of the transistor along with one end of the 330 ohm
resistor.  Solder another short piece of wire with the screw-eye connector
on the other end of the 330 ohm resistor.  Last, solder a third piece of
wire with the female connector to the emitter (E) of the transistor.  You
might want to do all this on a small piece of PC board to keep bare wires
from touching or you can heat shrink every bare wire.  Here's the classy
part:  Wrap the whole thing (with the exception of  the terminals) in
plenty of electrical tape or cast it in epoxy if you want to be classy.

Take the whole thing and plug the male connector into the hot 12V wire
coming form the speedo, connect the female connector to the + terminal on
the gas gauge and screw down the screw-eye connector with one of the
gas-gauge mounting nuts, and you're done.  Everything else should be hooked
up as original.

As I mentioned, this should also work on clocks, but I certainly don't have
one and, hence, never tested it. So try at your own risk.  This will NOT
work on a wiper motor!  At least not for long.  I'm still wirking on that
one.

         Ground           +6.6V

If this is all chinese to you, or you can't admit to your friends that you
understand this, but you still want one of these things, let me know.  If
there are enough people interested, I might put a few of these together.
Depending on how many I have to make, I'd say they would cost about $25.
All proceeds would  go directly to the paint-that-ugly-thing fund.  Let me
know and otherwise - enjoy.
