&gt; Drove up to a red light today behind a big,
&gt; military-looking sort of  hi-tech dump truck.  It
&gt; had a big, black, square body with some  kind of
&gt; lift in the middle.  I'm sitting behind it wondering
&gt; what  the heck it was when I saw the big, black on
&gt; yellow sign across the  back:  STAY 50' AWAY.  I had
&gt; to back over 3 cars!  Nah,  but I had to laugh.  I
&gt; wish I could find one of those for the back  of the
&gt; Bopmobile.  I do detest tailgaters.  Cheers....KR

No problem making the sign, but some thoughts I have
had:
A remote windshield washer nozzle (a) with water in it
OR (b) with soapy water in it OR (c) with light oil in
it!
Install somewhere kinda high, one or two gas-filler
doors with servo-type mechanism to open them and the
brightest HID lights that would fit, aimed to an
appropriate point...
A sign / bumper sticker warning that vehicle leaks oil
/ stay back! Add the spray nozzle for validation!

I really want to do these, but wonder how thick the
metal plate that I put behind the driver's seat and in
the door panel will need to be, as well as the
bullet-proof window!

Along that note, the company next door has done
repairs to Microsoft Bill's Lexus several times. The
doors on that thing must weigh 500 pounds each! The
window is prob an inch thick. -BaH
