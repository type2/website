Subject: Re: [T2] Windshield - hammer - teardrops!

&gt; Folks, let's not get paranoid about &quot;hitting&quot; the glass! I've seen at least 60
&gt; Bus windshields installed(10 were mine!) by pro installers, and to a man, they
&gt; all hit the glass, and not a light tap. I installed a junkyard glass myself, 5

Real life experience here,
My old '69 had a cracked windsheild for quite a while. My sweet wife got
me a windsheild for the holidays and I had a pro shop install it for me
and they did not have an easy time of it. One edge of the windsheild/seal
bothered me because it didnt seem to be fully seated in the frame. On e
day a few moths later while we were at a friends house I decided to give
it a little push, and then a harder push, and then a few more persuasive
efforts with open disributed palms. DOH! I never replaced the windsheild
in the '69 again and lived with it until I got a new bus. 
Dont hit I say!
My 2 pfennigs.
