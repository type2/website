Hi.

I've determined that whenever I work on my van, something must go wrong
immediately afterwards.  Alas, after I worked on the van this weekend I have
noticed strange engine noises. Particularly a loud clunk, which I suspect, but
have not outright identified as existing. Second, a rattle, like a plastic baby
rattle, which I am sure of.  The rattle occurs especially loudly at higher revs,
like say, anything above idle. While &quot;fixing&quot; the van, i cleaned the oil bath
air cleaner, added a little transmission oil, pulled the plugs to look for any
unusual residue, and... well that's it. It's probably something that I've fouled
up somewhere.

Thanks, 
 - Ian Bridwell
