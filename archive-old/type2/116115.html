Subject: Re: [T2] Oil pump for type IV Whose to Use

Hi Volks,

That would be me, I admit it.  I was ogling Bob's dash-pod full of 
gauges as he was pulling out of Ebus.

Bob's engine has Very good oil pressure.

Happy trails,

&gt; some of the folks at everybus saw my guage when I was there so can 
&gt; vouch
&gt; for the readings
