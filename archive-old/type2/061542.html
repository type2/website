Subject: Source for 6.0cm ID flexible heater ducting ?

Does anyone out there have a source for 6.0cm inside diameter flexible 
heater ducting ?

-this is the cardboard covered aluminum tubing VW used.

I've mounted a BA4 under my bus, and need this tubing to connect it to my 
heating system.

-any pointers would be appreciated.
Thanks
