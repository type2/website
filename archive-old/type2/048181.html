Subject: [T2] Intermittent starter failure

Hey Volks,

First a long description of my diagnosis of an intermittent starter
problem in my '78 Westfalia, then some questions. Bear with me please.

I've been having intermittent problems with my starter failing to start
(bright headlights, but no click of the solenoid, no sound when I turn the
key. Lights dim but nothing happens) since mid summer. First time, I
inspected the numerous electrical connections to the starter and replaced
one old and suspiciously frayed looking connector (turned out to be the
one that goes to the FI brain) and it didn't make any difference. I banged
on the solenoid with a hammer, then tried the key and it started.

I removed my starter and replaced it with what I thought was a reliable
used one. Brushed up all the various connectors to the starter (the 5 on
the hot terminal and the two female blade connectors). Started right up
then stranded me at my next stop. I tapped on the starter solenoid with a
hammer and it started right up. Was reliable through two more months of
heavy use, then started doing it again. Maybe this starter is old too?
Tapping the solenoid generally got me going every time. I drove around for
a week validating stereotypes about VW buses (crawling under the bus to
tap on the starter and get going in public places all over town) and then
replaced the second old one with a new rebuilt Bosch one. It started right
up, then stranded me on the second start. $^_at_*! Vigorous tapping on the
solenoid made no difference. Bright lights, key on = dash lights dim, but
no click, no nothing. So I took a screwdriver and jumped the hot pole on
the starter relay to the one that receives the ignition wire. And the
starter fired. Repeatedly. I tried the key, and it started.

My alternator is new. Voltage regulator is newer. Bettery brand new.
Battery clamps are new and secure and brushed up. I have a good quality
(but old) starter relay installed (the black plastic, barrel-shaped one
with two small connectors and two big connectors. Came with the bus, but
not original equipment). I figure that little test with the screwdriver
shows that the starter relay is still good. That leaves the ignition
switch and the wires that connect it to the relay.

I brushed up every connection to the starter relay. And then I found the
(rather hidden) connector that takes the ignition lead and routes it to
the starter relay and not to the starter itself (as in the vehicle's
original condition). This connector looks kind of melted, like too much
juice had been sucked through that wire once upon a time. I replaced the
melty-looking female connector, brushed up the apparently intact male
connector, reconnected, covered with shrink tubing, nice and clean. The
bus started. It has started 4x more since then.

So my best current working theory is that the melted connection on the
ignition wire was causing intermittent failures to start. And maybe while
banging on the solenoid I directly or indirectly tweaked that nearby
connection enough to get it working again. Despite the appearance that I
had a sticky starter solenoid (that responded on nearly a dozen occasions
to hard tapping on the solenoid), I really had a flaky ignition conection
near the starter.

So at long last, my questions:

Is my working theory correct?

How did that copnnector get melted? What condition might result in too
much juice being sucked through the wire from the ignition switch to the
starter relay? I don't know if I did that recently somehow (perhaps at the
time all my starter troubles began?) or if it's been like that for 20
years.

How common is it for the ignition switch to go bad? If I still have a
starter problem in the future, it seems like that is my only remaining
part to replace. And replacing that sounds like an expensive PITA.

How common is it for the starter relay to go bad? Anyone have any
experience? At FLAPS, I was told that a failing starter relay will start
&quot;burring&quot;, i.e. making a ticking sound. If this sound is very quiet, I
might not hear it from the front of the bus. I have not had the benefit of
an assistant in any of my starter situations. I hear no burring, only
silence. A new one would be $20. I'd replace it in a second if I thought
it would solve my problem.

So what do you all think? Any personal experience welcome here.
