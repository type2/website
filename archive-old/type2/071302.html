Couple of things...often the tubes can get dinged on the end and out of 
round, get a flairing tool to make sure they are round at bothe ends (careful 
not to enlarge them)...next gently sand (very fine grade) the inside of the 
tube holes to remove  nicks and burrs...when you install them use good ole 
vaseline to slide m in.  On your valve cvr gskts...you probably dented 
them...remove them and replace them (in fact do this every time you take them 
off)...they are cheap...when you do this make sure you don't have any solid 
residue on them...clean them and make sure that they are not dented around 
the seat...at the very worst, buy new ones from Ron at Busdepot_dot_com.  Also 
check the head rim for burrs etc...
Hope you are leak free soon.
Aloha
