Subject: RE: [T2] Vac Hoses

Yes that is the page that I used - He shows a port on the right hand side of
the manifold for the pres reg to decel valve - I can not find this port on
mine - I have two ports on the throttle body itself one facing forward (
firewall ) one facing to the rear( lid) my dist has the vac advance going to
the throttle ( forward) and the retard side of the dist going to the port on
throttle ( facing deck lid)
However the hose going to the tb from the vac advance is tee's and going to
the small port in the manifold right by the brake booster
Is this correct ?

&gt; My 75 FI bus has what looks like 2 vac ports on the throttle body - can
&gt; someone tell me what connections need to be made here- I believe the port
on
&gt; the firewall side of the throttle body links to the distrib - does the
front
&gt; port link with the pressure reg ?

The small port off the throttle body goes to the distributor &amp; the air
cleaner. the larger port (actually on the manifold) goes to the decel
valve &amp; the pressure regulator for the FI.

&gt; Just want to confirm - used the colour diagram posted by Richard but my
set
&gt; up seems slightly different from his -

is this the one you went from?
