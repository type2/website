Subject: Re: [T2] junkyards!!!

Lot's more European imports in the North East than down here in the south.

Find the VW clubs and ask where they shop. Another option is to hop on the 
web and search for Used+auto+parts+Volkswagen+NY



&gt;I'm in the New York area...most of the mail I read seems to be people from
&gt;out west or down south...bummer!!! ...this doesn't seem to be much of VW
&gt;country out my way...or is it??? ...I'm about 45 minutes west of Albany,NY
&gt;...anyone know of gathering's for VW people or junkyards where I can go and
&gt;browse???
