Subject: Re: [T2] seat belts in a splitty

Hi!

&gt; All of the Bay Window's come with pre-threaded and reinforced lugs in the

Only Buses and Kombis; Panel Vans don't.  And neither do Splitties,
which was the OP's question; although it may hurt, I'd recommend
welding in such mounting points.  Bolted-in seatbelts (bolt through
the floor, nut on othe side) will be torn out in a collision, which 
is when you'd really like them not to be.  At the very least, spread 
the load by bolting in a *thick*, *large* piece of sheet steel on the
underside of the floor.
 
&gt; Attach them through the floor, not the seat frame.

Definitely.  The seat frame isn't built for that kind of load.
 
Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
