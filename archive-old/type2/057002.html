Subject: Commuting in a Bus

I say go for it! My company car ( a butt-ugly Dodge Dakota) has been in the shop for the past two days, so I've had to drive my Westy. I've loved every minute of it. People at work that I've bored to death talking about it finally got to see it (polite comments) Also makes for a nice place to go eat lunch, rather than sitting in my office. But, the shop called late today, and the Dakota is fixed, so I'll be driving it again Monday. BTW, my commute is only 16 miles, but usually takes at least an hour, sometimes more.    Jeff
