Subject: RE: [T2] turbo your heat.

Putting the bilge blower before the heater boxes only helps marginally. This
is what the stock fan does anyway, but even the increased bilge blower
volume will not do much. Once the engine fan produces higher pressure inside
the heater boxes the blower will not do much (the reason for the flaps in
the stock blower ducts). Pretty much the same effect as the stock blower
which helps at idle and in town, but once you are on the highway, I doubt
that this will produce much extra volume.

The volume the inline bilge blower produced was good, but just not for very
long. Plus, the bilge blower was pretty noisy even before it failed - not
sure if I want to have two have these. I have thought about the
recirculation aspect myself and I am planning to try that with another bus
which has ductwork left over from an Eberspaecher installation in the engine
compartment.

Simple - put the blower BEFORE the heater boxes like VW did with the OEM
blower. Safer too - won't put you at risk of sucking CO into the system
through leaky (or potentially leaky) heater boxes. 1 list member set his up
with two bilge blowers. 1 took air from the rear interior of the bus and re
heated it (re-circulation feature) and the other Put fresh air into the
heater system like stock.

I parted out a '69 Beetle once that had a steel blow housing and squirrel
cage fan in-line. I think only steel would with stand the heat for any
length of time. Probably sourced via JC Whitney b/c this car had alot of JC
Whitney items on it including an a/c system.
