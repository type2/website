Subject: [T2] Cuting brake:

Lukas,

    A cutting brake works by having a separate handle to each emergence
brake cable. On a dune buggy, to turn right just pull up on the right
handle, cut the wheel to the right, and vice-a-versa. It will literally yank
the car into the turn. Probably not a good idea for the street. Plus it
would be hard on tires on pavement.
