Hello List!!

 Well, I haven't been able to read the list in a couple of days and I was
surprised at the amount of posts concerning the bus rally. Count me in for
bringing the baton to the Josh Rogers Memorial Beer Bash and Campout! 

 The memorial campout will be held at the Turner Falls Campground in Davis,
Oklahoma, right off of I-35 in south central Oklahoma. As of today, there
has been 20+ individuals who have comitted to attend. I will be
coordinating with the park officials on obtaining an area large enough to
have 25+ buses. Once that is complete, I will be able to inform you of the
cost (I think around $8 per bus) to park for the event. Current plans are
for the memorial to be on Saturday night, but I will be there on Friday for
any early arrivals. 

 Once again, for those who didn't know him, Josh Rogers was a very outgoing
and caring indivdual who loved life and friends. He was best known for his
69 red, white, and blue painted bus and love going out sand railing. He had
at one time a pretty extensive web site devoted to the type2's and still
has a library which can be found on the type 2 website. He is missed amoung
his extended type 2 family and hence, the reason for the gathering to honor
this man.

 More information to follow as it comes available!!!
