&gt; I've remarked recently that my steering is becoming quite loose.  It is
&gt; fine at low speeds, however when I'm passed by big trucks on the highway I
&gt; feel the burst of wind will blow me off the road.  It's scary sometimes,
&gt; especially on windy days.

First off, this may or may not be your steering box. What size load
range of tires are on your bus? This will impace how it handles with
that stuff a LOT! Also worn tie rods ends will cause sloppy handling.
I would jack the front of your bus. Take the wheel that is off the
ground &amp; rock it back &amp; forth the direction it will move while
turning. Do you feel any movement? If so things are worn. Check this.

&gt; Apparently there's a screw that I can tighten that will adjust the play for
&gt; the wheel.  I plan on getting under the bus to see if this adjustment will
&gt; fix the issue.  While I'm under there, is there anything else I should look
&gt; for?  Any advice for setting the proper play for the steering?

I doubt it will fix the issue. On my split window bus when I adjusted
the steeing adjuster It didn't help anything, just created a &quot;hard&quot;
spot to turn. I just moved it back out to where it needed to be so the
wheel turned freely. but check out everything else first.
