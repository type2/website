&gt; Anybody out there have a setup so they could bench test injectors? I was 
&gt; thinking of doing this myself, good thing I didn't try and &quot;let the magic

&gt; is the pulse rate? I would like to be able to bench test some injectors 
&gt; before i go installing everything.

see the link I just sent for the generator to make the pulses, as far
voltage and pulse rate. I think the voltage is still a nom 12v. But
the pulse rate should be engine rpm x 2. One thing this doesn't
account for is the variable of how long the injector is open. could at
least let you see how the spray pattern is on the injector.
