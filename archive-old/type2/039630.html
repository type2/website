I concur with Bob, coupler is a likely candidate.

&gt;1) TO bearing(?) has been making minor noise  (engine running in
&gt;neutral)
&gt;when clutch pedal is depressed.

Noise when the pedal out may be minor, noise when the pedal is depressed is 
likely more important.  However I doubt it's at fault here since you said 
the clutch disengages properly.


&gt;2) Shift lever making noise for a few days. Sounds like computer
&gt;hard drive
&gt;when reading a big file. Small up or down pressure on lever makes
&gt;noise
&gt;go away.

Doubtful that this is a major problem.  Mine does this due to the shift rod 
bushings being sloppy.  One of those things that I'm gonna fix when I get a 
round tuit - even have the new bushings sitting in a box in the closet (Bus 
Depot).
