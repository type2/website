Subject: Need advice on repairing my Crew Cab

Hello all!

I have been on the list for quite some time but never really read it because 
it often comes in the form of a download file that cannot be read by my 
computer.  Anyway, I have a few questions for all of you.  I'd appreciate an 
e-mail off list if that is not too much trouble.

Sticking Caliper:  My Crew cab had been sitting parked (garaged) for about 8 
years and now it's back on the road.  I bled the brakes and all seemed fine 
until I started driving it. I could feel the truck dragging after I let off 
of the brakes.  Apparently, one caliper is sticking when I press the brakes.  
How can I fix this?  Will more bleeding do the trick?  Will the caliper need 
replacing?  What year calipers will work (the truck is a 1971)?
LOWERING:  Does anyone make lowering spindles for the front of a bus?  I'd 
like to keep the stock ride while lowering it a bit.
Tire &amp; Wheel combos:  I thought I was really smart.  The new Passat and Jetta 
use the same 5 X 112 mm bolt pattern as a Bus.  So, I bought some Passat 
wheels only to find out that the centers are hub-centric and will NOT fit 
over the type II  hub. $%&amp;#*_at_!!!!!!  Arrgh!  What is a guy to do for cool 
rims?  I don't want to spend a lot (less than$100 each) so I am limited in my 
choices.  Besides the OLD Mercedes wheels what will fit?  Any suggestions for 
some cool wheels?  What is the largest size (wide) I can run?  Has anyone 
ever installed Porsche 911 rims?  Is it difficult to adapt the type II to 
accept the rims?
Rubber pieces:  Does anyone make seals (windows) for a late crew cab?  I'm 
looking for the small rear cab area side window seals.
Broken Door handle?  My driver's door will not open from the outside.  I 
thought the handle was broken so I removed it.  It was perfect. I greased it 
up and put it back and everything was working.  Then I locked the door and it 
quit working again.  When I squeeze the handle it feels really loose like it 
isn't making contact with the inner door.  Has anyone else experienced this?
One last question!  Wiring:  I have one black HOT wire that is a mystery to 
me.  I is running over towards the wiper switch but no wires are missing 
there.  It's not even in my shop manual!  It is a factory wire because it has 
the plastic wiring sheath on it.  Any ideas?

Thanks in advance for all of your help!

Dave
