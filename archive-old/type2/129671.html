Subject: vacuum port on carb

Does anyone have a picture of the proper place to tap in a vacuum port to a
set of solex carbs that does not have this port, so that a vacuum advance
distributor can be run? Carbs like these:
http://cbperformance_dot_com/catalog.asp?ProductID=1214

This guy says that he will tap it for a $40 fee, but his carbs are only 40mm
Kadrons. Anyone have any experience with this person and his product? Looks
like he does some work to the carbs before they are send out to the owner.

Thanks,
Corbett
