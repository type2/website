&gt; Justin Condon sends:
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I just spoke with someone that said that some engines take the o-ring,
and
&gt; &gt; some take a paper gasket with four holes in it.
&gt;
&gt; The paper gasket goes over the dowel pins on the end of the crankshaft.
&gt; (There's also a metal gasket with four holes in the seal kit--some engines
&gt; use it instead of the paper one.) The o-ring goes into a machined recess
in
&gt; the flywheel.

Justin,
 you probably diden't notice it before, because, as Jim says, it's recessed
in the flywheel.
