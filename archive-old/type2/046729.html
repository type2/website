you should have taken the hint- the tank is clean already...and those little
paddy things come off real easy to paint the tank and then reglue them...

&gt;I'll have it back in a couple of days. Is there a way to determine if
&gt;the gauge mechanism is NG before you install the engine and hook
&gt;everything back up?


this is too easy- connect the sender and ground it, then move the float and
see the level at the dash gauge. if the gauge was accurate before, then don't
bend the arm, but if not, then when you install the tank, check the gauge at
empty and then either adjust ( bend ) the arm or fill the tank, check the gauge
at full mark and adjust it there.
