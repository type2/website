Subject: Clutch cable

After removing my clutch cable to inspect it, I noticed a &quot;plastic&quot; sheath 
on it about a foot from the front pedal hookup point.  The sheath does not 
slide on the cable in either direction, is it supposed to slide freely on 
the cable?  What purpose does it have?  TIA
