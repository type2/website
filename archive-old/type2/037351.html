Subject: Overheating engine

Scenario #1
Would a missing engine compartment seal solely cause an engine to overheat? 
Consider that the outside temp was about 10F, I was travelling at 50mph and 
with no significant load.

Scenario #2
Or would it be more likely that the crankshaft seal came out then the engine 
overheated due to lack of oil?

What would cause the crankshaft seal to fail?

I appreciate your help.
Thanks

Peter
