Subject: [T2] Warm Starting Prob

&gt;Have a '71 Westy.  All stock engine and parts.  About 20 K on a rebuilt engine.  No probs other than recently it will not start
&gt;after it's fully warmed up and I shut the engine off.  If I wait over a few minutes and try to restart it while it's still warm, it
will &gt;not start.  The engine/starter turns over no problem.  Getting good spark at the plugs.  Cold start, no problem.  Have a
starter &gt;relay installed.  Cleaned and checked all the important electrical connections.  Clean plugs.  Strong fuel pump.  Carb
&gt;adjustment, timing, dwell...no recent changes.  Appear to be right on.  Ideas?
&gt;Thoughts?

Since there is an obvious problem, something in the diagnosis is incorrect.
The failure to start when hot may include excessive pumping of the gas pedal which floods
the carburetor, an unconscious habit. Does the ignition fire at all, or backfire ?
Suspect failing coil or condenser, swap in a known good one and / or verify by Bentley procedures.
Verify ignition points, timing, carb adjustment- &quot; appear good &quot; is not good enough.
Improper electric choke adjustment.
malfunction electromagnetic cut-off valve.
This item can flood the engine with fuel.
( Check oil for a fuel smell. )
valves set too tight, verify compression test procedure.
