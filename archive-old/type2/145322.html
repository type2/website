&gt; I got mine installed and have almost 100 miles so far.  Mine came the same

The other difference from the stock engine is that the plugs are long
reach!  The installed plugs are BP5ES-A, but the -A is the designation
that NGK uses for OEM applications.  Replace them with straight BP5ES
plugs.

The long reach plugs are better for keeping the threads nice.  The heads
are thicker which may be better for avoiding cracks.  VW should have done
this originally!
