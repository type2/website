Subject: RE: [T2] Type 4 dual carb spark plugs

According to Bill May(worked at Bosch in California &quot;forever&quot;) the 
platinum plugs are *not* for a air cooled cars.  He says that
they used to give them to the employees to try out and that on his
a/c vw's it made them run hotter with not much other changes.

Bill is on the vintagvw list and has been &quot;doing&quot; vw's since back
in the Gene Berg days in California....actually, I am not sure that
Bill and Karl are not brothers&lt;grin&gt;.

Bill is extremely adamant about *no platinum* in a/c vw's but never said
anything about the porcelain.

Wonder what late model a/c porsche engines came with from the factory???


Just my 2 cents worth!

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi Richard
&gt; 
&gt; The only plugs besides the recommended Bosch W8CC I would try in a type4 is
&gt; the Bosch W8DTC or the W7DTC (cooler for the summer) plug that is a Copper
&gt; triple electrode, I have noticed a difference in performance with them, I
&gt; would stay away from the Platinum plugs in an air cooled , I have heard of
&gt; several reports of the porcelain coming loose and blowing out! 
&gt; Do a Google search on &quot;sparkplugs_passenger.pdf&quot; and use the &quot;INTERNET
&gt; PLUGS&quot; link this is a vary good reference glide from Bosch for there plugs.
&gt; I have tried to put the link in but it never works :(
