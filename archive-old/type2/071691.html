Subject: Pulling the engine tonight, anything I need to know?

I'm pulling the engine tonight on the &quot;new&quot; (to me) 83, I just 
bought.  Anywords of wisdom.  The last VW engine I pulled with the 
tranny (A1s and A2s excluded) was a 69 square back 20 years ago. 
With the D jetronic frying valves on a regular basis I got quite 
adept at pulling that engine.

Bentley is rather non descriptive on this issue.  Do I need to remove 
any engine tin?  Where do I need to place the jack.  Where is the 
center of gravity.

Any and all help is greatly appreciated,,
