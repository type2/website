Subject: RE: [T2] Really long RCA cable for Type2

Or go to Radio Shack and get a female coupler to join two RCA cables
together to make them longer. I do it all the time. We push audio well over
50 meters without much sound degradation.

Where can I get an above average quality RCA cable, that is shielded so I
can run a remote wire and speaker wire alongside of it, that is 25' long?

I don't want to spend a lot, I am thinking $65.00 maximum
