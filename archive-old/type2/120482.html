Subject: shift coupler

Hey every one. 
Last time I was home I replaced the shift coupler, and
I was wondering was I supposed to put greese on it?
The old one was covered in what seemed like bearing
lube, but it didnt seem like a good idea (imagine the
old coupler covered in 1/4&quot; of greese and road dirt).
So I just put the new one on and drove away. Should I
lube it or let it be?

Duncan
