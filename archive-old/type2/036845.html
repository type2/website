Subject: re:RE: speaking of brake cylinders (64-70 made in taiwan?)

I have a  large supply of Varga left and right 64 to 70 front wheel
cylinders in stock, also aTe and FTE (both German companies), also the same
in rears. I personally don't like LPR (italy) I dont feel that the castings
are that good and have seen some premature failures in the last 5 years,  my
suppliers group them in the same class as India and Taiwan.
I personally have used most of my products in the vehicals that i own and
drive and will only sell items that i would use myself (which i have).

I have also just recieved some 1955-1962 front wheel cylinders that are made
in China, these will sell for a lot less then the now only available aTe,
but i will not release them till i have tested them (am installing on my
1960 DD to test), I feel that after a month of daily driving I will have a
fair idea on how well they will hold up. The good point is they use the same
rebuild kits as the 64-70 wheel cylinders.

ps. blow out sale on all TVS (india) and LPR (italy) brake parts





&gt; I just got an order delivered from Bus Depot for my 67. I ordered 2 left
&gt; &gt; fronts, 2 right fronts, and 2 rears.  Both left fronts and both rear
were
&gt; &gt; Brazilian. Both right fronts are from China.

Duh!  I have no idea what I was reading on the left front boxes. The boxes
are made in USA and the cylinders are from India. Oh well,
China/India....both 5 letters, both have an i and a n, and both end with A.
