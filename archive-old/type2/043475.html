Subject: HELP! Pilot bearing gone
Content-Disposition: inline

&gt;If so my old one was fried and its outer remains seem
&gt;welded to the sides. Is it supposed to just slide out? I'd like to get the
&gt;what's left of the old one out, and put the new one in.

I went to a auto parts store and bought a pilot bearing/bushing puller, or
rented
one, but it didn't work that great because it wasn't designed with the
2 liter VW motor in mind. (I think I broke the tool) It did eventually work in
conjunction with a cheater pipe stuck into the ground behind a block of wood
abutting the bottom of
the flywheel, up under the puller and then prying outward while someone stands
on the motor. Be careful putting the new one in. The first one we bought didn't
fit - turned
out to be a Rabb*t pilot bushing. I also heard of someone forcing grease
in there to the point where it would push out.
