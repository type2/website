From: &quot;John Baker&quot; &lt;harmony_at_buszen_dot_com&gt;
&gt; Anyone have an extra old &quot;VW&quot; nose emblem for a 74-79
&gt; bus laying around?  I have a ton of Bay window parts
&gt; to barter or I can do it the &quot;new fangled&quot; way and
&gt; just pay you some money for it.  Doesn't have to be
&gt; perfect, just use-able and reasonably in-expensive
&gt; (read John is a &quot;cheap b*stard&quot; ;^)

Same here as John, but I'm interested in repro'ing the emblem.  Not sure of
the legal implications, but at least having an emblem I can easily replace
for my own bus would keep me safe from souvenir hunters. :O)

Giacomo is a '77 if that makes a difference, and I would need to pay for it
(few items to barter).
