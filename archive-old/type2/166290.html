Subject: blue vanagon cap'n seats

Someone in Colorado should snatch these up for $50 for the pair.  They 
can be seen on South University in Denver during normal business hours. 
  I have no connection to Andrew the seller.  His phone number is in the 
ad.  I have these same seats in my bay.  I was lucky and got mine for 
$50 for the pair as well.  This is one of the best upgrades I've done to 
my bus.  My butt thanks me every single day.
