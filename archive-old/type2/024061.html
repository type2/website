BUZZ, BUZZ, BUZZ the alarm clock throbs at 5:15am, and it's still dark. I had 
been out at Beetles UK on Tuesday to get the first 6 month service on the 
Amazon Snowbird; Chris Jones (one of the owners) asks if I want my van to be 
on TV. They don't have a camper in stock at the momement and I'm the owner of 
a Brazilian camper living closest to Bournemouth where &quot;Meridian Television&quot; 
will be doing the filming is to be done. The programme is to be an edition of 
&quot;Roadshow&quot;, a motoring series looking at various vehicles for enthusiasts.

At 5:15am on the Thursday morning agreeing doesn't seem such a good idea; but 
Holywood beckons so I drag myself out of bed and get away from home just 
after 6; fill up with petrol, and point the Amazon Snowbird on the road to 
stardom.

There's more traffic on the road than I expected and I'm being baulked by 
slow moving lorries on twisty, single carriageway roads. Hang-on a bit I'm 
doing 80km/hour a speed I would have been quite happy with in 'Primrose' (my 
old camper); it's amazing how quickly I've got used to a 64hp fuel injected 
aircooled 1600cc engine.

The instructions say to take the A338 into Bournemouth, follow the signs to 
&quot;BIC&quot; (Bournemouth International Centre), and meet up on the sea front next 
to &quot;Harry Ramsdens&quot;. The A338 is a dual carriage way packed with rush-hour 
traffic and lots of exits; but there's a sign for &quot;BIC&quot; and another, 
eventually turning off the dual carriageway I follow the signs and I'm at the 
&quot;BIC&quot;. Down to the sea front and there are some other VW campers, but I've 
seen them to late, have to drive past turn around at a roundabout and a 
minute or two later I've drawn up next to them and checked that they are 
there for the filming too.

The other VWs (two splittie campers, one bay window camper and one bay window 
crewcab) are local to Bournemouth and are driven by members of the &quot;Passion 
Wagon VW Club&quot;.

Film stars have to look their best so I spend some time removing the latest 
collection of dead flies off of the front panel, before we all drive down to 
the promenade where the vans parked looking out to sea and watching the first 
filming of the day.

The continuity theme of the programme is to be the use of VW campers by 
surfing enthusiasts; and is to include some shots of the local lifeguards 
surfing. Shots on the beach are done with the camera hand held. On completion 
of the beach shots a counterbalanced, trolley mounted boom is built to mount 
the camera on. It's amazing what the camera man can do with this - camera can 
tilt, turn, zoom and focus at the same time as the boom moves up and down and 
side to side.

The presenter, Lizzie, is on the beach and, while speaking the opening lines, 
walks up onto the promenade, past a line of parked VWs and into my camper. I 
have to start the engine as soon as Lizzie finishes speaking and drive off as 
soon as Lizzie has shut the door. Sounds easy, but I've got an automatic 
immobiliser which will only give me 10 seconds in which to start the engine; 
I solve the problem by removing the immobiliser key from the key ring so I 
can keep the ignition key in the lock while timing when to turn off the 
immobiliser and every thing goes smoothly.

After the open shots Lizzie interviews Dave inside his camper; Ian, the 
camera man, even gets his boom mounted camera iside of the van too!

We all get interviewed in turn about what is good in our campers, Lizzie is 
filmed inside of the Amazon Snowbird with the kettle on the stove 
'pretending' to make a cup of tea.

They want shots of Lizzie driving my camper, so here we go up the promenade 
with Lizzie, camera man, sound man, director and me in the camper. All goes 
well until a skate-boarder, looks at us then deliberately reverses out in 
front of us. Thank God VW put power assisted brakes on my camper. We almost 
come to a stop, the skate-border flips out to the side unharmed, 
unsuccesfully tries to grab the engine air intakes for a tow, then tries to 
chase us along the promenade. I'm just glad the twit hasn't achieved his 
death wish today.

Varrious other sceens followed including the 'aircooled' drivers giving 
oppinions on a &quot;Bilbo's Breakaway&quot; camper based on a T4 Transporter. We all 
liked the body colour but thought the inner gray was rather dull and the 
storage was limited. I think I would have problems taking mountaineering kit 
and two weeks food on holiday in one of those! Quite a bit of interior volume 
is lost by having a front engine and bonnet. This was the cause of my major 
dislike of the vehicle as the view from the drivers seat of the front corners 
of the camper was nonexistant - OK thats the same as on a T1, T2, or T3 
camper but their corners don't stick out so far.

A Swift Gazzle motorhome based on a VW LT35 was brought on the sceene 
dwarfing our little campers. This would comfortably carry 10, and sleep 6; 
with central heating, cocktail cabinet, luxury kitchen, and bathroom (with 
shower). Very comfortable, but rather large to park outside my house and in a 
different league from our line up aircooled happy campers.

Then it was up and down the promenade again for some &quot;two car tracking&quot;. The 
camera man sits in the open hatch back of the lead car while a camper is 
driven up to two or three feet of the rear before passing first on one side 
then the other under &quot;radio control&quot; of the director who's driving the other 
car and watching a TV monitor at the same time. It was 'nervy' driving my own 
camper that close to another car at 20mph; but then Lizzie 'borrows' my van 
so that she will be in shot for the overtaking sequences - me I'm sitting on 
the floor out of shot thinking about skate-boarders.

As the day draws to close the camera man finishes off a collection of shots 
of my camper from all sorts of strange angles and I make my way home while he 
finishes off on the other campers, arriving back just before 10pm. A long day 
but that's the price of stardom.

The programme should be going out during July - for the benefit of the 
'Brits' I will post the date and time when I know.

Good Luck
