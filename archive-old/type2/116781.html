Subject: engine overhaul

So ... I've got the engine OUT of the van and almost naked.  Now, I realise 
that I dont have the time or all of the equipment to do the FULL overhaul 
myself.  I think I'd like the case split and pistons and cyls replaced.

So, anyone know of a good place to take this to in Vancouver BC?  Ideally, 
I'd like to watch the process so I can get as much education out of this as 
possible, but I realise this isn't a very likely possibility.  How long 
would this take at a shop?

Alternately, anyone in the Vancouver area that has a couple of days to kill 
which could help me do this properly?  I'm willing to pay or exchange for 
the service...

Cheers,
- Ian
