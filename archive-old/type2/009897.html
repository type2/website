Volks,
  I've finally found a working window wind mechanism in a junked bus to
replace the current arrangement manufactured by Wooden Peg &amp; Duct-tape
inc., one of the many advantages being that the window will now come down
when I actually want it to. Getting the old mechanism out of the drivers
door wasn't too much of a problem, just a little brute force required (NB:
Always wear thick gloves when doing this kids, you need your knuckles).
However, I am having trouble working out a procedure for putting the
replacement mechanism in, the sticking point being the indentation in the
door frame where the bottom of the cab quarter light is attached. This
creates a clamp which was overcome by pulling down on the loosened old
mechanism whilst an assistant pryed a small gap with a screwdriver, the
reversed procedure does not seem to work for installation though.
 Anyone know a good way of getting the replacement mechanism in, then?
