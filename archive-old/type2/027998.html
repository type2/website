Howdy
Just completed first camping trip with new engine etc...Finally got all bugs worked out (most of them at least). I just had a few minor questions that normally I would search the archive for, but for some reason I am unable to retrieve any messages from it?  ANybody else have this problem or am i doing something wrong?
Well, anyway, here goes:
1) Ideal timing for 82 2.0 CA emissions w/ electronic ignition...Book says b/t 4-6 atdc.  I tried that and under load it still sounds a little advanced (slight pinging sound).  New engine, all new injectors, etc...no vacuum leaks.  Any other ideas?
2)  Where can i find the little circuit breaker for the AC elec system that mounts below the 3prong plug  to the left of fridge?  
3) How is the propane filled?  I'm hoping that the service station attendant will know, given the rigorous mental and physical training they undergo at hiring, but I am not going to hold my breath. 
4)  what is safe temp range for cyl head gauge and oil temp gauge?  finally got them both working, but I can't find anything in my book (haynes).
5)what is the largest size tire i can put on 2wd westy and not rub fender/suspension/etc...and still be able to handle the steering wheel?
6) Where can I find the thin/ deep-V belt for the a/c.  My unit is mounted in the dash and the control plate says &quot;Behr&quot;.  Is this a factory,dealer or aftermarket unit?  I can't find the belt anywhere and i only have fragments of the original.  ANy suggestions?
Muchas gracias
