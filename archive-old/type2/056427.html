Subject: Re: Miles per gallon

Hi Volks

 OK, not to start an MPG war, but our 76 Westy with 137,000 miles and
the original fuel injected 2000cc engine gets 19 around town and 23 on the
highway.
On our last trip into New York we got 23. Our mileage does drop however
when 
the temperature outside is  minus 20F   : (
   There has been a lot of discussion about carbs vs FI,
and I had a '71 bus with the old carburated engine when we lived in
Virginia, as 
well as still have a 72 Beetle with a carb. I have no intention of going to
carburators on the 
76 Westy. For all around starting and driveability (-40F to +110F) FI is
the way to go.
If carbs were so great all new cars would have them...

IMHO of course,
