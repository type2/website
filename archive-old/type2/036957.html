I have a 71 Westy that runs hot.  It has the stock DP 1600 with oil bath air
intake.  When I shut the engine off after driving it, the tin around the
engine is very hot.  Is it supposed to be this hot?  What should I check out
first?  Should I replace the oil bath setup with a paper element?

Thanks,

Bryan
