Subject: Re: Push Rods

&gt; It's a '79
&gt; automatic bus that's been converted to a camper. The owner says that the
only
&gt; repair it needs are new push rods, and depending on my offer, he will have
&gt; that done for me. Roughly what should a repair like that cost being done
at a
&gt; garage?

Somebody is blowing smoke. The 79 should have hydraulic lifters with steel
pushrods. They don't go bad! Perhaps a lifter or 2 has collapsed? You or he
needs to take it to a different mechanic and get the true problem diagnosed.
