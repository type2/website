Subject: 050 distributer timing
Mime-Version: 1.0

Just when I was about to replace the dual carbs on my 74 westy, I decided
to try an old distributer that came with the rest of the junk when I bought
the vehicle.  Anyway, the one that was in there was an 009, yea!  The one I
stuck in late last nite was an 050.  Made it to 60 mph with out the first
idle jet or main jet clogging up, or fuel filter for that matter.  Anyway,
you get my point, it must not be the carbs, as getting over 50 was tough
this past weekend, especially up hills with a loaded camper, 35 in 3rd &amp;
losing steam.

I checked the library, and the section under 050 distributer says it is a
stock vacume/mechanical distributer.  CB performance catalogue says it is
mechanical, with no 3rd cylinder retard.  The one in my vehicle now is
mechanical.  I have had little luck finding archive material with an &quot;050
Distributer&quot; search.

The best performance with the old 009 was setting the timing at 10 btdc,
and it would advance to 32 btdc at 3,000 rpm.  The 050 seems to have a lot
more total advance, but as I tried to set the idle timing closer to tdc,
the engine would start to stall.

Could somebody with some 050 experience let me know where to set this
timing, and what are the limits on  the advance at say 3500 rpm?  I don't
want to burn the engine up.

set up: 1800 type IV (the kind with the plastic timing scale), Dual
Dellorto 36 DRLAs.
(would gladly install a stock vacume distributer if available at a decent
price)
