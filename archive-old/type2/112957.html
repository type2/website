Subject: Re: Oil, is my dad full of it?

What a load of crap. I have 5 different vehicles, and switch oil often,
including between synthetic and dino oil. All oils are compatible to federal
regulations. In the old days there might have been some truth to this, but
those went out with flatheads and strombergs. :-) 
I have a hi performance VW engine with approx. 160HP and I use either
Penzoil or Valvoline, whichever is more reasonable that week at the local
flaps. In my motorcycle I sometimes use synthetic if I'm going to be driving
around town alot as it has great anti-scuff properties. I would say you have
more of a danger of screwing up your engine by using the improper viscosity
than by changing brands. Tell your dad to re-educate himself, many things
have changed since the 40's and 50's technologies.
Regards,
Courtney
