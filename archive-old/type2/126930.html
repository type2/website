Subject: dumb CDI questions

So I installed the CDI yesterday and it runs great.
Then I decided to drag out my tach dwell to double
check the advance curve and hooked it up as per normal
(ie to the negative side of the terminal and ground)
and it didnt work...duh... so where do I hook the dang
thing up to now?

Also, before the operation, my timing (1800 T4 weber
ICTs 009 (gasp) dist.) was set 6D BTDC idle to 30D
BTDC max advance. After it was 7.5 DBTDC and 32 D BTDC
max. is this a big difference? (I checked the libary
and the timing 009 article said &quot;about 30BTDC max . .
. is 32 ~ 30? I dunno.) Ken you tell me.

Lastly while dinking I noticed that the weber had a
vaccum fitting on it (tucked away on the Right
manifold.) Im going to be doing some milage tracking
for awhile and Id like to do some milage expirements
on a vaccum advance dist vs. the 009. Unfortunetly I
have the wrong vaccum advance dist (113-905-205T type
I) so if anyone needs one of those and has a
021-905-205 (N or AB? I dont know, I only see one
vaccum advance port on the carb) they want to trade
let me know.

Next the thermostat coil.. but not today.

Duncan
