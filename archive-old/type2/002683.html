Subject: Existential Vac Advance question
Date: Sat, 16 Jun 2001 22:46:47 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I just read on page 73 of Bentley's Engine &amp; Clutch chapter that the vac
advance had a temperature switch and was cut off in all but 4th gear at 54
degrees.

Well, like every other up to date VW person I have gotten religion on the
subject of vac advance, and its superior ability to respond to load not just
RPM.  Now I find that  (at least here in the balmy latitudes) it was turned
off most of the time.  Saint Hoover save us!  Should I doubt my faith?  Can
I spend that $400 I was saving for a Mallory vac advance dizzy on slow women
and fast gin?

Regards,

Grant
