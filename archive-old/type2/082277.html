&lt;&lt;  Well, this has been done to death. Just fill the freaking thing with a 
good 
&gt; GL-4 lube or Redline MT-90 and Shut the F*&amp;k up. ( to borrow a saying from 
&gt; D. Leary). Christ, you folks should know better than to argue with the 
&gt; newbies, it never works out. Let 'em fry a tranny or two......They'll

Compassionate conservatism...?-( 
Any (accurate) info is good info, especially for newbies. We weren't
all born with innate VW knowledge, BTW. A lot of what was considered
common knowledge has been empirically proven false - 009 distributor,
cooling flaps removal, etc. 
Case in point, a counterman at a local FLAPS, (who drives an early 911,
BTW), argued with me about GL-4/GL-5...His defense of GL-5? The 
Porsche dealer he gets his parts from said it's OK...Now this guy's no
mechanical dummy...His Porsche is rebuilt and reliably fast.
Besides, in a purely self-serving mode, I'd rather keep a newby's trans
in good working condition...Maybe he'll keep the rest of it up too, and
buy parts from BustedBus, or BusDepot, keeping them in business so
you and I have a place to buy parts from...
As an aside...Anybody else remember dealing with British cars? I've
often wondered how many ended up trashed because of using the
wrong brake fluid (a GL-4/5 comparison)...?-(
