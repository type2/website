Subject: Re: did the brakes, new axle leak problem

THe big rubber thingy with the ring is the seal ya wanna replace.
Also, I like to use some permatex aviation sealer on the gasket
sealing surfaces.

I forget where, or if, the rubber rings go.

The axle tube is hollow, which will continue to fill your reduction
boxes.  Remember to top off the tranny before you're all done.  When
I do this partucular job, I always drain the tranny first.

BTW - I think I'm looking at new reduction box bearings soon. :(
$25 each for the bottoms, $30 each for the tops, X 2 sides :(

I'm getting some play in the rear wheels...
