Subject: Re: [T2] How much Loctite #518

&gt;I pay about $8 for 
&gt;a tube of Curil T and I think 50 ml of Loctite 574 is about $30 if you can

All the places that mark it up would like you to think that.

I get it locally in Sunnyvale, CA for for $18 at RS Hughes:

They also have bulk pricing.

Some of the local machine shops have offered to sell it to me at a good price but I've never taken them up on the offer.
