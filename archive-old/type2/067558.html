&gt;Subaru made a mini van and PU that looked much like the VW... 

Subaru made a few different aircooled cars in the 60's....
They were called &quot;360 Deluxes&quot; as cars, (displacement?) and
I dunno what as vans and trucks.  Rear engine, two-cylinder
Kawasaki 2-stroke powerplant.  Cylinders fired together.. 
very simple motorcycle engine!!!  4speed tranny also, and they
sound like weedeaters driving down the road.  I've driven a 
67 360 Dlx, suicide doors(!) and all, and you can barely fit
one person in these things.  Ten inch wheels, for cripes sake!
They also made a pickup trick that had a ramp-side bed gate.
Oh yeah... And the Subaru dealers can still get PLENTY of NOS
parts for them at _REASONABLE_ prices!!!!!!!

Try that at yer local VW rip-off Dealership (Home of the
$450 34PICT)
