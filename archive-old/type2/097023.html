Subject: Points &amp; Condenser for Bosch 050

Does anyone know the correct part number for the points and condenser for a
Bosch 050 (mechanical advance only) distributor (same as for 009?)  I keep
this dizzy in my spares as a backup, but I think I might have the wrong
points and condenser for it.  Just want to double check now instead of
finding out at 3am in the rain...
