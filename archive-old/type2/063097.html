Subject: Empi center cap stickers

Volks Folks,

Does anyone know where I can find replacement Empi logo sticker for the
center caps on my Empi Sprint Stars?  I have a set of 5 luggers.  I
understand it is the same sticker for the 4 lug and the 5 lug.  If anyone has
a center cap with a nice sticker that I could BORROW that would work out
great too.  Any help would be appriciated.  I have been thinking about
reproducing these myself.  Anyone else need some?  Please reply direct.

BTW, if anyone is looking for Empi stickers for the center caps on either the
5 spoke or the 8 spoke Empis (or look-a-likes) try Matt Joy at 402-488-5947.
 He is kind of hard to get a hold of, keep trying.

Thanks,
Dan
