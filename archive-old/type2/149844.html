I've seen it and I've been warned.  I changed them all on my vanagon.
Didn't do it on this rig because I didn't think 4 yrs was very old?!!  The
ones I switched on the 80 Vanagon were 25!???

&gt; WHOA!!!! if you are saying the fuel lines on your bus are approx 4
&gt; years old, replace them all now. Engine fires are a major problem with
&gt; our buses. Fix that first. Do a search on thesamba for fires and see
&gt; what can happen if you don't.
