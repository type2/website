Ray Hale rote:

The problem occurred that night when we
&gt;went out to dinner and found out in the parking lot at the restaurant
&gt;that the left turning radius was severely decreased.  You could turn
&gt;on a dime to the right but hardly anything to the left.  Apparently
&gt;that's how the wheel got straightened out.  Took it back yesterday &gt;and
&gt;waited for it while they gave us back the proper turning ability &gt;and
&gt;
&gt;I'll live with a crooked steering wheel until I can take it off and
&gt;&gt;hopefully move it up top.


So I sez:

Can't be done I'm afraid. The type2 steering wheel is not splined; it is
aligned with a woodruff key, thus only one position on the shaft.

You can't adjust the steering if it becomes skewed. Only one tie rod is
adjustable so you can't compensate for changes in the steering wheel
position caused by toe-in adjustment. What your aligners may have done was
to adjust the linkage between the steering box and the lever on the front
beam (dunno what it's called). As they discovered, that adjustment is for
centring the steering box not the steering wheel.

When I bought my 63 Dormobile it had bad tie rod ends on the solid tie rod
and my local flaps didn't have such a thing, but they did have ends for the
adjustable tie rods so I bought them and went home and pulled the
adjustable tie rod from the Green Machine (split panel, murdered by teen
driver jumping red light), fitted the new ends and replaced the worn solid
tie rod with reconditioned adjustable and now I've got perfect alignment of
front end and steering wheel. Call it a retro-fitted stock improvement;-)

Have fun
