&gt;Here is my problem:  My wife has been VERY tolerant of my VW obsession,

&gt;when it gets really hot on those long trips.  For those of you in cooler,
&gt;or dryer climates, you might not understand, but here in Kansas, it can be
&gt;100 degrees or more and have 100% humidity!!  Now that's hot.

Similar weather here in Dallas, but for a greater portion of the year.  :)

&gt;What do you think?  What problems will I run into?  Does towing a small
&gt;trailer burn up a 2000 engine?  I am going to install an earlier (69-72)
&gt;tranny for lower gears.  I like to drive 60-65 M.P.H. so the lower gear
&gt;tranny wouldn't be a problem.

It won't kill a 2-liter engine, especially with the lower gears.  

&gt;Advantages:  (please feel free to add more)
&gt;1.  No need to install all the &quot;plumbing&quot; on the bus.

But don't you have to cut through your poptop and roof?  That's pretty major. 

&gt;2.  The roof AC and generator would cost less than trying to put a new AC
&gt;unit on a bus.

I wouldn't assume that.  If anything, I think the cost would be close.  

&gt;3.  AC ANY TIME, even when parked at the store, or camping at night, engine
&gt;does not need to run.

Not the bus engine at least.  In my mind there isn't much difference
between running the bus engine and a generator - both make noise and one
uses somewhat less gasoline.  A catalyst-equipped 2-liter at idle is pretty
quiet.

&gt;4.  Extra power for lights when camped.

Minor IMO.  DC lights and propane lanterns are more than adequate, and they
are quiet.

&gt;5.  When you didn't need it, unhook the trailer and leave it.
&gt;6.  No need to load and unload a heavy generator when camping, just leave
&gt;it in the trailer.
&gt;7.  Extra room for camp gear in the trailer.
&gt;8.  Only 1 AC unit and it is self contained.
&gt;9.  When you get home, just leave the camping gear in the trailer.

All true.  I think the biggest benefit of all is that it's relatively
simple and pretty much guaranteed to work reliably.

&gt;Disadvantages:  (please feel free to add more)
&gt;1.  Expensive.

Yes.

&gt;2.  Extra weight to tow.

Not only that, your mileage will go down, you will pay more on toll roads,
you will have trouble finding parking spots, you will have to worry more
about braking, crosswinds, rough roads, etc..  To me, these are the kinds
of disadvantages which more than make up for all of the benefits.  I am
going to try the dual A/C setup instead, but that's just my preference - I
would encourage you to try the trailer setup if you don't mind these
disadvantages.

&gt;3.  AC unit would have to be permanently mounted to roof of Westy on the
&gt;luggage rack.

Here's a thought - put the A/C unit on the trailer too!  Use removeable
flex dryer ducts to route the air into the bus.  The major problem is where
to have the ducts enter the bus.  I'm lucky, I already have a hole cut in
my spare tire well and a rotted out battery tray that could be cut also.
Hmmm... the ducts would have to be insulated as well.  Okay, so it's not
the greatest idea in the world, but it's a start, right?  :)

&gt;4.  You have to tow trailer if you want AC.

There are other possibilities, but none are very attractive.  For instance,
Damark is now selling a 1500/3000 watt inverter ($300 I think) which could
probably power a rooftop A/C unit.  My 5000 BTU Panasonic suitcase A/C only
draws about 4 amps _at_ 120V, which translates to about 45 amps _at_ 12V
(including losses).  Installing a 100+ amp alternator (or an additonal 55
amp alternator) and some deep cycle batteries might make it feasable to run
the A/C while on the highway and even for short periods when stopped.  To
get the current down you could even swap in a D/C blower motor instead of
the A/C one, although that would be some serious engineering.

Another possibility is to install engine-driven A/C and a large 110V motor
to drive the compressor while parked (with hookups of course).  The biggest
problem with this is that you would have to swap belts every time you
wanted to switch power sources.  I can't think of an easy way to make that
one work but I'm still thinking it's the best solution since the only
redundant part is the A/C motor.  I've already bought the motor so it will
be tried before long.  :)
