Jeez, here I am FARTing again!

Read on....

Again, I dissagree. So does my VDO head-temp guage. I
conducted this test for almost 2,000 miles and found
*ZERO* difference on my '69 1600 sp/.009/single-quiet
exhaust. I ran premium for a month on my daily drive,
then a month on plus, then a month on regular
unleaded. This went on for over a year....also did the
old &quot;one-way-with-premium-the-return-with-regular&quot; on
road trips. Nada.

&gt; 
&gt; I've posted on this before. How many on the list
&gt; complain
&gt; that their engine runs hot, even with everything
&gt; timed and
&gt; set perfectly. I'll bet you they run cheap fuel.

Ah. Cheap fuel. THAT is something else alltogether
(that too, is covered in the FAQ you sent to me)!!!
There is just no excuse for running crappy fuel IMHO,
and that *will* cause different running temps (hey,
I've been poor and had to use crap-gas a few times
myself;-).


&gt; Others on
&gt; the list have posted that they note lower engine
&gt; temps with
&gt; higher octane.

And for them, running premium is the right thing, just
as both George (not to mention your pals at MIT) and I
have said...

&gt; 
&gt; Run what you want. I just like to see facts rather
&gt; then
&gt; opinion. I think MIT (the people that approved the
&gt; FTP site)
&gt; can be relied upon for the facts.

As I said, re-read the FAQ.... it clearly states that
unless your vehicle *requires* that you run premium,
and/or, you are experiencing ping/run-on, a lower
octane rating is *fine*. That's a fact. It says so, I
read it!

Sean Bartnik also covered the different rating
method... a 91 octane rating at the pumps in Germany,
equates to a *lower* rating here in the states.
