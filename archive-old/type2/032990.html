I am looking for a new/rebuild/working used starter for my 77 baywindow
2.0 FI.  Any suggestions?


I have a suggestion. Buy one locally. I have sent a lot of cash to BD and
other mail order houses this year, and they are fine. In the case of
starters, alternaters, regulaters and the like, I would buy one locally.
Why?  The fail rate on these items is so high that you may go thru a few of
them before you get one that works. The last time I replaced my alternater,
the first never worked, the second was fine, but I had to also buy a second
regulator because the first defective alt ate it.
    I was on the road in Florida in 94 when My starter needed replaced. I
let a shop do it...thrice! THREE starters to find a good one. It is still in
the bus today. They mechanic made about ten bucks on average because he
&quot;honored the warranty.&quot; He wasn't happy.
    Buy you a good Bosch rebuild and hope you don't get one that was rebuilt
on a Monday or Friday. YMMV
