Subject: Re: [T2] Thanks from the friend with an electrical question

Start counting the number of 30 or even 20 year old vehicles that are
still being registered and driven on a daily basis and I'm sure that the
VW's will be very high on the list. 
Once an individual overcomes the neglect, abuse and storage woes of the
VWs previous owners its a very good investment.
I've got the same expanding file folder as I see every other VW owner
using and my total expenditures including the purchase price, all the
tires, batteries, a rebuilt engine I've used in seven years and I've been
145K for just about $4000.00 and I've still got a $4000.00 Westy left
with a 8K engine, 4 new tires ... Yada Yada it continues. 
One of the best things is that if you're got a nice van of any year:
there are buyers out there if you decide to bail out.

&gt; Thanks to all who replied to my last post about the guy who now owns 
&gt; my old 66 and had NO electrical power.  You all were right on the 
&gt; money (but of course!) Seems that the wire going to the starter from 
&gt; the battery had come loose and was loosing contact.  He tightened 
&gt; everything up and his new '66 is back in business. Plus it makes me 
&gt; look like less of a heel, being that it was a minor thing, because I 
&gt; PROMISED him when we made the trade that the bus was VERY reliable 
&gt; and NEVER gave me an ounce of trouble (and that's the truth!)  
&gt; Thanks!
