Subject: Re: [T2] Manassas bug out this weekend

You must have misread.  Just saying not much of a &quot;vintage event&quot;  H20
guys.I could care less about, but the organizers of the show bush it as a
vintage event.  It is not anymore.  I can see a 2003 new beetle convertible
at the mall, or a 2002 passat at the grocery store.......well I guell the
ones around here don't have 17&quot; rims and $2000 stereos..........but still,
not a whole hell of a lot of restoration involved............

There are a few sweet rides that come, But, after an hour of walking around,
you have seen all the vintage stuff in Manassas.  Maybe 1 1/2 hours at the
swap meet, and then the drags.........but to me, after a hour or so of that,
it is the same thing over and over again.  Same cars win.    It would be fun
if local, but all i am trying to say to those driving great lengths to
it...don't get your hopes up.

I can see a sweet splittie at Snoopy's house that would win a trophy
there.......and only have to drive 20 miles to see it! I am saving up to go
to the classic next year.......until then, maybe the bug jam if my 412 is
restored by then.
