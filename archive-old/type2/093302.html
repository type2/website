Subject: Re: [T2] bucket seats

Do that Vanagon seats work in the early baywindows. I put Vanagon seats in 
my late bay window and see them fairly often on the Vanagon list for $50 a 
pair plus about $50 for shipping.

I tried GTI seats in my bus only to find them too high. I cut the legs off 
and lowered them as far as i could and they were still quite high. Oh well, 
they'll go in my Beetle when it returns to the streets of TN.
