Hi Again Chris, 

I built the engine around a used case that was reconditioned and 
modified by Ahnendorp in Germany, I pulled the crank out of my 
stash, and kept measuring till I found an acceptable base, it is 
still stock size, and was balanced from the pulley to the pressure 
plate, each part individually, and the whole assembly as a unit.
The rods were rebuilt by Ahnendorp as well, balanced to within 2Gr. 
difference between them, I corrected them to less than 0.5 gram 
difference, the 4 wrist pin bushings were reamed in one go, in a 
fixture, forged 90.5 Mahles, came from Ahnendorp, and are 
considerably more expensive than in the US, shipping would 
have made those more expensive, I wouldn't want 92s, not in 
my Bug, and surely not in my Bus, I wish I would've started out with 
a new case though. The cylinders have been scrubbed as per Hoover, 
The heads are Genuine VW, bored, reshaped and CCd chambers, 
all casting flash between fins removed, Berg head studs and nuts, 
Berg pulley bolt and chromoly gland nut.

The oiling system starts in a  Berg sump, then through a Berg 30mm 
pump and Berg pump cover with built in relief valve through Racimex 
hoses to a Racimex filter adaptor, Fram HP1 (costs $20 here), pipe-
plugged galeries, through a genuine VW, new, not rebuilt, German 
oilcooler, which was around $150, new genuine VW OP pistons and 
springs, Porsche OP sender/switch, $75.

The valve train is built around a very mild and torquey Engle W100, 
(can recommend for a Bus) Ahnendorp hardened lifters, Berg 
push rods, VW Brazil new rockers, Berg rocker shafts, new VW 
rocker stands, Porsche swivel feet adjusters ($152 a set without the 
nuts) Berg keepers/retainers/springs/shims, Genuine VW aluminum 
spring loaded push rod tubes, these are $43 each, come with the 
seals, if you really want to do something about leaky push rod tubes, 
get the original soft rubber seals, from the top of my head: 113 109 345 C, 
but you might want to check the number.

Breathing starts through a $375/set of Porsche 356 airfilters, surrounded 
by K&amp;N prefilters, then 40 P II Solexes, $2200 a set, Berg manifolds, 
Ahnendorp linkage, Ahnendorp big(ger) diameter heaterboxes, light weight, 
no aluminum fins around the tubes, flanged where they meet the stainless 
Ahnendorp header, then into two stainless steel mufflers which are placed 
left and right next to the engine, the complete system is Ahnendorp, and 
costs about $775. 

All tinware except the front and rear tins and the pulley tin that goes with it, 
are NLA from VW, is new, genuine VW, most of it came from Berg, 
except the valve covers (dealer) and the fanshroud which orignal VW, 
new, german, and cost me roughly $225. The used parts were selected 
from my stash again, particle blasted, and the new parts were stripped from 
their original paint, zinc plated, and re-painted. The thermostat system was 
built up from new VW parts, ordered every possible part from the micro fiche,
from the shutter to the smallest washer and spring, all this was zinc plated, 
even the bracket that holds the thermostat is new.

The only used parts in this engine are the case, crank, alternator stand, 
front and rear tins, pulley tin, rear engine brace. Every nut bolt, washer, 
spring, clip came from either VW, Porsche, or Berg.The Type III case 
has no dipstick hole, instead I used a Berg coverplate for the filler tube 
hole, drilled and tapped for an oil level inspection glass, the top edge 
of the glass corresponds with the maximum mark on the stock dip stick.
I aim at 150 Kkm with this engine, the oil was changed very frequently
during its first 5000 Km, and prolly will never see more than 2500 Km 
intervalls, I guestimate that it produces about 90-95 Hp, and that it will 
do so for a very long time.

I shopped around for parts since I got the car in '90 or '91 or so, and I 
started driving it March this year. I have had my share of experiences with 
non genuine parts and/or recommendations, I realize my standards may 
be unnecesary high, you don't need 356 carbs, yet I love them, like the 
fact that they were made for a very similar engine, and run well even with 
stock jetting, parts can be had from any Porsche dealer around the world, 
the place where you can still order an owners manual for a 1950 car, 
VW doesn't do that, many 356 are still available from the dealer, even while 
production stopped in '64-'65. Of course that alone doesn't justify such 
expensive carbs. The Porsche shops manuals are also a great help in 
providing detailed info about these carbs, the maintance they require, and 
have trouble shooting tips, genuine Porsche. I'm also not rich, far from it, 
I had a lot of time to gather the parts. The only part that the Alfa Romeo 
dealer could supply for my 36mm Dells was the top cover gasket, or the 
whole carb for which they quoted around $175 each before tax or discount. 

I like building a car from the ground up, but when I'm finished, I want to 
be finished, do the maintance, maybe investigate performance upgrades 
if the character of the car permits, and t should be -very- reliable. 
The bus was valued by my insurance company two weeks ago, the dash 
is still in primer, and the door panels are not in place yet, they set it at 
$18K My next project is based on a new Mexican Bug. I'll CC this to list, why 
not :)

BTW, I've seen prices In Germany for turn key 2.4 and 2.7 liter T4s, including 
carbs, exhaust system, and 911 Porsche cooling fan conversions, starting
around $10k, some produce well over 200 Hp (din).

Brian.
