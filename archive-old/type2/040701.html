FWIW, the Devcon........ didn't really work...... Still drippin'....... But
you have to admit, it *was* worth a shot.... Mind you, it's not spewing
forth as much oil.. But its only 4 days since it was done...
The clutch though..... what a dream.... (see, holding on tight to the good
news.....)

Well, he's back in my driveway! $428 later, which I thought was reasonable
considering I was paying for labour costs.
I gave the mechanic the list of things to check re the clutch, all of which
were done.
