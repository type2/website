Subject: 78 Bus starts but won't run!

Hey everyone- came out of work Saturday morning and my 78 bus started
right up but then died.  Started it up again and the same thing
happened.  It is cranking fine, it just won't keep running unless I keep
my foot on the gas revving it, and it backfired a few times.  When I
turn the key to the accessories position I can not hear the fuel pump
running.  Does this mean bad fuel pump?  I am getting it towed Monday-
help!  Thanks, Beth and Prudence the 78 Bus.
