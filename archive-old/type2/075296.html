Subject: Bad Situation.........anyone help?

Hello all,
     This is alot more than I ever planned to ask the
list but I don't have alot of options.  My families
Pontiac GrandAm crapped out this morning and the only
other car we have is my 78 Bay.  Well, its at the shop
having the fuse panel rewired.  In short, the mechanic
says he cant figure out 6 wires related to the FI.  I
bought him the Bentley manual but he still can't
figure it out.  That or he hasn't taken the time.  I
am wondering if there is anyone in the
Asheville/Hickory, North Carolina area that would be
able to help me.  Maybe with the wires and possibly a
ride the the mechanics shop in Hudson, NC.  I have run
out of options and have no way of transportation, so I
am trying to do anything that I can think of.  You
have all helped out greatly in the past and I
appreciate anything that can be offered.

Sincerely

Troy S Wical
