Subject: RE:  POR-15 &amp; fiberglass

I don't know about POR-15, but I just re-painted my top with Rustoleum =
Professional white (got it a Lowes in a 1 Quart can, not a spray can).  =
Before painting it I hit the roof with a palm sander with 220 grit.  I =
painted it in my backyard with the cheapo $0.59 disposable brushes.  =
There are a few drips as I didn't really take my time, but considering =
that I spent less than $20 to do the whole roof (I also repainted all =
the luggage rack bars and the brackets with an old can of grey paint I =
had lying around) it looks great.  It definitely meets the 20/20 rule =
(looks good from 20 feet or at 20MPH), hell it meets the 10/10 rule.  My =
neighbor's comment was that he didn't know you could buy brand new =
pop-tops anymore!
