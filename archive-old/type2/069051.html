Subject: VW Vendor Listing On-Line

Well, it's still a little ragged around the edges and I could really use
some tagging help (like how do I adjust my columns so the middle part of the
table is wider)? ...but I just put up a list of almost 300 VW Vendors...and
I'm missing a bunch. Right now you have to search using your Find or Search
feature on your browser. Every listing is alphabetical, but I know some lead
off with the word VW or Volkswagen when they really shouldn't. I'll get it
right in time. I'd also like to provide a feedback form to ensure I get all
the info on proposed vendors, but my HTML is rustier than the windshield lip
on a Jersey yard bus!

The list is at: http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~jfournier/vwvends.htm

PLEASE help me clean up bad addresses and phone numbers...and add missing
vendors, etc.

Thanks! Joe
