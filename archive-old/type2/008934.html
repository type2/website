Hey All,

Several people expressed interest in locking latches
for their engine lids. My pal Ashley at Always V-Dub
in Portland, Or has them NEW for $18.00! Made by Hella
and comes with 2 keys. Look stock. '68-'74 (ish) or
whenever they changed...don't know what year.

Call him at (503) 235-2757 or e-mail always_at_always_dot_com
