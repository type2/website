&gt;&gt; Single vac, tall(like 009), has a 3 pin connector mounted to a bracket
&gt;&gt; near the bottom.
&gt;&gt; 311-905-205 AF
&gt;&gt; Whats this from and what is that connector for asks I.

&gt;Fuel injected type 3.
&gt;
&gt;the wires go to the fuel injection.

Steve is, of course, exactly right.  The VW type 3 and all Porsche 914's had
Bosch d-Jet fuel injection on their type IV motors.  There is a removable
module (held in by 2 screw) where the connector is.  The module is called
the trigger points and it sends a signal to the FI brain telling it when to
open each pair of fuel injectors.  I haven't tried it, but I'm told you can
use the distributor even after removing the FI.
