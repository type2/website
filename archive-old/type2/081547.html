Subject: camper &amp; tent picture

Hi-

I have been enjoying the pics of EB, esp. the green/white Westy with the
green/white tent.

Anyone have any other pics of their camper with their tent that they could
send?  I am purchasing one soon, and want to see what is out there, for
real.

Thanks-

Lori
