Subject: Are there different kinds of 34 PDSIT 2 Carbs? 

Hello,

I am about to rebuild a left side carb for my 1700 motor for my 72 van. I 
have a couple of carbs to pick from, but as I was trying to decide which is 
best I realized there were two different carbs. The first difference is that 
one carb has a rectangular thing that Bentley says is a &quot;idle mixture 
enrichment&quot;. The other carb has nothing there but has a square thing on the 
opposite side, which is not identified in Bentley.

The second difference is that one (the one with the idle mixture enrichment) 
has a &quot;hot idling valve&quot;, which is for automatics. My van is a standard. Can 
I use this on my engine? Will it affect performance if I do?

Which carb is correct for my motor? Why are they different? Which is better?

Thanks, Phil.
