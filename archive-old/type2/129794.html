Subject: RE: [T2] Westy need seatbelts in NJ?

I don't know about NJ, but here in MA my bus without rear seat belts is not 
illegal since it is older than 25 years
and according to federal law it doesn't have to meet EPA nor DOT regulations...
I have a 1960 Studebaker and it doesn't have seat-belts either, front or back.

PS:
Regarding the out of order comment regarding south of the border, just for 
&quot;Barry's&quot; info, the best &quot;special blend&quot; cigarettes come from our north of 
the border neighbors... and the biggest market for them is &quot;people&quot; from 
the USA...

&gt;Tom, you are obvious very adventurous.
&gt;
&gt;You may wish to go over the southern USA border into Tijuana Mexico, and 
&gt;offer a ride up north to San Diego for 'people' willing to pay $100, 
&gt;provided that they sit in the back area of the Westy that does not have 
&gt;seat belts.
&gt;
&gt;You could ask them to bring some of their special blend of cigarettes with 
&gt;them if you are really looking to push the envelope
