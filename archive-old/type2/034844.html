Per the March, 1993 HVW, they run a 1776cc engine with a 135
main jet, 65 idle, 50 accel. pump and 50 aux. idle.

They also caution that the adjusting screw on the linkage
arm (fast idle screw) should not touch the fast idle cam
when the choke is off. The throttle plate should be closed.
If not, you by-pass the idle circuit and the carb will not
work properly. The carb is made to adjust from the idle
circuit to the progressive circuit ports above the closed
throttle plate. With out the proper transition from idle to
acceleration, you get a flat spot.

Rio Grande Tools sells metric drills in 0.10mm steps. You
could go 5 over or under.

A Speed Shop might sell 0.050mm step drills.

Or you can use standard number drills. A #55 drill will get
you 132 (1.32mm, 0.0520&quot;); #71 will get 66 (0.66mm,
0.0260&quot;); #76 will get 51 (0.51mm, 0.0200&quot;).

If you over drill, soft soldier the hole up and redrill it
to the size you want.

I run a 019 (iron body 009) and like it better then the duel
vac dizzy.

&gt;     I am attempting to rejet my 34 pict 3 because of a noticeable
&gt; leaning out in the starting of acceleration of each gear.  I read an
&gt; article in some VW mag that I cannot remember the name of off hand, and
&gt; it said that to remedy this flat spot the idle jet needs to be
&gt; enlarged.
