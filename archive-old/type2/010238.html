Damn quote filter!!

&gt; Okay, okay guys. I shouldn't have posted that.
&gt; 
&gt; It appears 'underpanels' or whatever were std on some early bay sunroof
busses
&gt; and i just had never seen it.
&gt; 
&gt; My learning continues.

&gt; &gt; two of the best busses I have seen seem to lack the bottom panels that
&gt; &gt; &gt; close off the underside.   When you look underneath - you can see the
big
&gt; &gt; &gt; girders going lengthways,  and the out-riggers that stretch from these
to
&gt; &gt; &gt; the side of the bus - above this is the corrugated metal &quot;floor&quot; - but
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; thin metal panels are missing.   
&gt; &gt; &gt; The question is:  DOES THIS MATTER ???
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; ???
&gt; &gt; I'd say not since they probably were never there.  Could this be
something
&gt; &gt; exclusively euro?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Never seen a bay that you couldn't grab the frame on - or a split for
that
&gt; &gt; matter.  Maybe you're thinking it should look like the underside of a
type1?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The bug is a unibody = no frame whereas the bus is a more traditional
&gt; &gt; body-welded-to-frame-construction.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'd like to know if you have *ever* seen a bus that was not 'exposed'
&gt; &gt; underneath and who/when/where manufactured that bus?
