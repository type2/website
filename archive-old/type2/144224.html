Yes.  Just let the engine turn (in neutral) while tightening the nut.  The
motion lets the belt &quot;ride up&quot; the pulley while the pulley halves come
together.  You can feel when the halves come together tightly if the belt
is sufficiently loose.  At this point, you can use a screwdriver to hold
the pulley for final tightening.

At this point, you can wiggle the belt to test for tightness.  1/2 to 3/4
inch of play is what I run.

As you can see, it is best to start with too many shims between the pulley
halves and to remove them one at a time until the play is correct.
too loose is better than too tight.  You'll probably need to
re-adjust a new belt after 100 miles or so.
