Subject: Model ident ?

Dear All,
a few more points about this model -

1 - apparently, there is a red equivalent with the same series no. and &quot;Cafe
Hag&quot; on the side, and
2 - what is a &quot;Fourgon&quot; ?
3 - Does anybody know when these were built by Majorette and are there any
others in the series ?


Thanks again

Dave
