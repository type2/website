Subject: Re: Indicator arm is done!


Isn't it nice to know how to get the wheel straight too!
Not so scary once you try it. However, i would look up the torque for the 
steering wheel nut, just to be sure it is properly tightened.

&gt;Thanks for all the tips guys.
&gt;Jeremy, you turned out to be on the ball.
&gt;I had to buy an entire arm/switch assembly.
&gt;The steering wheel lifted right off, though, &amp; the
&gt;horn button  I could remove easily.
&gt;In fact, it was MUCH easier than replacing the starter
&gt;motor, which I've done before.
&gt;For the record, the steering wheel nut on the '77 was
&gt;a 24mm nut.
&gt;In fact, I had to buy a socket especially to do the
&gt;job.
&gt;:-)
&gt;Cheers

&gt; &gt; Well, you probably already got it fixed, but i will
&gt; &gt; reply anyway. I have a
&gt; &gt; 77 and the same EXACT thing happened to me a few
&gt; &gt; weeks ago. you have to buy
&gt; &gt; a new turn indicator lever assembly. i spent about
&gt; &gt; 28 usdollars on one.
&gt; &gt; then, you use a knife to pop off the horn button.
&gt; &gt; then, you use a 17mm
&gt; &gt; socket (i think it was 17, maybe bigger) to undo the
&gt; &gt; nut in the center of
&gt; &gt; the wheel. Then, you use your knees to pull the
&gt; &gt; wheel off. Then you look up
&gt; &gt; under the plastic by your knees and see where all
&gt; &gt; the wires go. you pull the
&gt; &gt; wires down, the old assembly comes off with just a
&gt; &gt; little patience. you
&gt; &gt; slide the wiper switch off first. put the new lever
&gt; &gt; on, put the wiperswitch
&gt; &gt; on, and reassemble everything. took me about 20
&gt; &gt; minutes, i would double
&gt; &gt; check the torque setting on the steering wheel nut,
&gt; &gt; just to be safe. good
&gt; &gt; luck!
