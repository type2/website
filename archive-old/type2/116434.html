Subject: Re: [T2] Rust removal

I've been thinking about this too.

My 76 had no underside rust but my new 65 has it all over. 

My thought was that removing the rust first would be best too, but isn't the product called:

(P)aint
(O)ver
(R)rust
(1)
(5)

???

&gt;I can't remember what Por-15 says about aplying on &gt;rust, but I really don't think it's a great idea.
