Subject: measuring tools

All,
We've had discussions on the value of measuring tools, i.e. dial indicators,
micrometers and calipers.  Bob in one of his sermons talks about an
&quot;apprentice kit&quot; from tool manufacturers and had recommended Enco to me.

I got their latest sales catalog in the mail and they have the following:

Enco 3-Pc. Tool kit - 0-1&quot; micrometer, 6&quot; dial caliper, 6&quot; flex ruler; model
number 600-0000.  All three pieces $25.99

Enco 26-Pc Magnetic Base &amp; Indicator Kit - magnetic base holder, 1&quot; travel
indicator (0.001&quot; graduations, reads 0-100 with revolution counter),
22-piece test indicator point set, universal dovetail clamp for test
indicators, 3-diameter rod (5/16, 7/32, 3/8).  Model 625-0309.  Cost $24.99

Don't personally know much about this stuff, but I'm learning.  I ordered
both sets.  I have no connection with Enco other than being a customer.
Usual disclaimers.  But I thought someone else might be in the market, like me.

Enco phone - 800-873-3626.  They also have lots of other tools.
