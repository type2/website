&lt;&lt; There is always the latex paint applied with a brush. I've actually seen 
this done. There used to be a pretty decent Model 'A' Ford that ran around 
near where I lived 20 years ago. He painted it with house paint and a 
brush. From 50 feet it looked okay. Closer it still looked okay if you 
closed your eyes... &lt;grin&gt;

There was a Morris Minor in a backyard near me that was painted in latex
forest green to match the foundation of the house...Every year would be
my guess and every thing except the glass...Last I saw it, it was a green
house (lotsa flora growing inside it), and nothing but a thick latex shell
holding together whatever metal was left... ;-)
