Subject: howdy, and some questions

Hi everyone, I've been away for awhile but now I'm back.
Been reading the list but haven't said much...

My bus has been running pretty good and I love driving
it more then ever. I've got two questions though I
hope you guys/gals could help me with.

First on rebuilt engines whats the general thought
on retorquing the heads.
From the archive some one said VW said it wasn't needed?!
While others said they did it, the best idea problay would
be to do it.  I'm at 350 miles right now on a rebuild
I was going to wait another 100 miles because I have to
remove the engine to fix a oil leak in the clutch area.
Would it be OK to wait till then to retorque the heads?

My second question is about CV joints. I was thinking about
getting a inexpensive press some where to remove the
joint from the drive shaft. A big hammer isn't doing the
trick so its either this or someone at a machine shop
with a press.  So how big of a press do I need for the
CV joints and what would be good for other bus projects
also, multiple uses i'm hoping :)

Now to get working on that heat!

Thanks
