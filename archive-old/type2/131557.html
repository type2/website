Subject: Double Relay?

Well I finally have finished moving in and settling to some extent. Back to 
the bus...I was testing the Double Relay per the Vanagon Type II Fuel System 
Manual and the directions that Greg Potts sent. It doesn't look good for the 
relay.

I tested the various connections with ground and without and so forth. I did 
these tests with the ignition on and the harness connected. My question is 
when testing the terminals on the relay should the harness be connected to 
the relay? I did not try testing with it removed, just hoping this is the 
reason.

Thanks,

Michael Knight
