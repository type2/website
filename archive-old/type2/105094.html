Subject: Re: [T2] blue smoke startup

&gt;Have you looked at your air filter? For a while I used to get a fair-sized 
&gt;blue cloud at start-up until an overdue tune-up where I discovered oil 
&gt;deposits in the air box . After replacing the air filter the problem 
&gt;disappeared.

I've gotten blue smoke starts from parking on an incline.

I've also heard that it's better for an aircooled head to be rebuilt 
without valve guide seals - at least on the exhaust valves. This can 
contribute to puffs of blue smoke at startup.
