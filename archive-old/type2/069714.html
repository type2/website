&gt; Lisa Quinn asked what Ellis meant by the reference to a &quot;Frankenstien&quot; bus...
&gt; 
&gt; I meant to indicate the various stories and factual accounts of VW bus type
&gt; vehicles that have been manufactured and sold in South America (Chile,
&gt; Argentina, Brazil, Mexico etc.) which look like a mixture of what we refer
&gt; to as the typical '68-'79 &quot;Bay Window&quot; style but with rear corner windows
&gt; and early style interior panel material (mint field and darker green
&gt; stripped/houndstooth etc.) or Salt and Pepper seat material. One such bus
&gt; was owned for a short time by Dan Lawson, owner of Competition Enginering,
&gt; Phoenix, AZ, USA. This bus was an example of all of the above. The VW emblem
&gt; was stamped into the front sheet metal compared to the US standard of a
&gt; separate emblem that was attached to the nose. To clarify, the emblem stuck
&gt; &quot;out&quot; of the surface of the nose skin. It also had disk brakes in the front
&gt; but had the old style reduction box swing axle tranny instead of the IRS
&gt; tranny. The tail lights were of the 63(?)-71(?) style. The front nose
&gt; resembled a 70's vintage. Dan appropriately dubbed it the &quot;Frankenstein&quot; bus
&gt; refering to the monster created out of misc. parts.
