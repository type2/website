Subject: Re: '74 vs. '77 fuel tanks

&gt;I'm talking to a list member about buying a fuel tank from him to replace
&gt;the iron-oxide-and-varnish model I have now, and he raised some questions
&gt;about the compatibility of his '74 tank with my '77 bus --- specifically,
&gt;that the supply and return lines might differ. My bus has been retrofitted
&gt;with a 1600cc upright, if that matters.


Speaking purely from memory here, the only difference that I recall is the
existence of a return fuel line port on the later tank (due to the fuel
injection system on the '77).  Since your '77 has been converted to an
upright engine, I am guessing that it has also been converted to carbs,
hence the second line on your existing tank has already been plugged up
anyway.  If this is the case, I do not believe you will have any problems.
