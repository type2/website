The pancake returned to its lair about 3:00pm. As you may remember, the
engine came out to replace the clutch. Replacement was stalled by a shredded
pilot bearing and no replacement available.  There was much sadness.

Scott from Foreign Accents ( VW FLAPS in Greensboro, NC) saved the weekend.
He let me in the shop after hours to get the part I needed and loaned me a
clutch alignment tool. Heck he even dropped by and helped us wrestle the
engine back in. That's service.

The big question mark was the shredded pilot bearing. Many thanks to George
Lyle, Dave Easterwood, Tom Young and Joe Fournier for answering the call for
help and support. Here is how it played out. Removed flywheel. Used big
scredriver across housing with a block of wood for a fulcrum point. Then we
applied several persuasive blows with a 5lb  sledge and out it came. It was
more work to get the flywheel off than remove the bearing:)&gt;

Dave Easterwood pointed out that the pilot bearing for the T4 engine is same
as the one in the T1 gland nut. If you find yourself in the same situation
you may have more luck with the FLAPS finding that and removing the bearing.


It took  awhile to sort out the mess in the driveway and the engine
compartment but by 7:00 it was all done but the scrubbung so I did a couple
of victory laps around the block and called it a day. I plan to treat the
bus to a nice wash and wax next week.

My deepest gratitude goes out to Chad Sibert who spent the weekend working
on the bus with me. Without Chad I would still be out there now and not even
halfway done:)&gt;
