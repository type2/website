Subject: Throw-out bearing for '71

Does anyone know how finicky '71 buses are about their clutch throw-out
bearings?

I'm on my second '71 bus (I'm not fickle, I just switched from a
passenger bus to a pop-top). On my previous '71, I was never really able
to adjust the clutch very well, and it never felt right. I also had to
replace the clutch and pressure plate about once a year. When I did the
replacement, I often found that the spring &quot;fingers&quot; of the heavy-duty
pressure plate were worn unevenly; all had a groove worn in them where
they touched the edge of the throw-out bearing, and  some of them didn't
spring back all the way up when the plate was unbolted from the
flywheel.

I now need to replace the clutch on my '71 pop-top and would like to try
to avoid whatever it was that was messing me up previously. One thing
that I wonder about is what the proper throw-out bearing is for a '71.
The books show a bearing with a white plastic ring bonded to the the
surface that meets with the pressure plate splines. However, parts
stores always sold me one that was all-metal, claiming that it was the
correct one for my year.

Can anyone help?
