Mike,

I know this will have absolutely no relevance for you but I paid a 
wrecker $A60 for one shaft. But they sent the wrong one, twice. They 
sent a green one (for a camper) and I wanted a red one (for a bus). 

So I drove down to Sydney (286 miles return) to return the wrong one. 
The guy ended up giving me two, one for each side, plus a pair of the 
rubber doughnuts for the spring plates. 

I ended up being very happy with the deal and that wrecker is my 
first stop for s/hand parts now.
