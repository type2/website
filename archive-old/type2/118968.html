Hey thanks Vincent.
I do have that book, I never noticed it there!
That option, although not common here in Australia, I have seen quite a few,
and had a few seats to choose from when I bought the one I have.

Well, I don't know if you call it trouble with road authorities. If it's a
standard option I need to get an engineers approval to the change in seating
capacity, then make the change to the registration with the road
authorities.
If I can't prove that it's original, load tests and a few other things need
to be added to the engineer's approval process to do things officially. The
load testing subjects quite high loads to the seat and mount, much more so
that factory fitted seats need to comply with.

Cheers,
Richard

&gt; &gt; Does anyone out there have a VW brochure showing a
&gt; &gt; Kombi fitted with a middle front seat?
&gt; &gt; It's the ones that go between the driver and
&gt; &gt; passenger seat over the walk
&gt; &gt; through section.
&gt; &gt; If so, could I get a copy of the page showing the
&gt; &gt; picture.
&gt;
&gt; Sorry for my late reply on this (it was posted on
&gt; 09-feb).
&gt;
&gt; Do you have the book Original Volkswagen from Laurence
&gt; Meredith? It shows this option of having a walkthru
&gt; bus but with three seats in the cabin (this option
&gt; makes no sense to me but it was available as M501).
&gt; The picture is on page 93. It is actually a very rare
&gt; option and so far I have only seen it for real in the
&gt; bus pictured in this book.
&gt;
&gt; Do your road authorities give you so much trouble on
&gt; this?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; yours,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Vincent
