Subject: Re: [T2] Seats from Vanagon in Late Bay

From: &quot;Jack Hattaway&quot; &lt;jack_at_law.utah_dot_edu&gt;
&gt; Nope. There is a boxish channel on the outside of the door panel on my
&gt; 75, 76 and 78. Sits a couple of inches above the vent.

I bought a pair of captain's seats from a local RV'er who'd upgraded his RV
and didn't need the older seats.  I thought that they would be neat
replacements for the missing front passenger seat and completely shot
driver's seat in my bus.

One little problem.  They were too tall to fit. :O(

So, we went without for some time.  Then I took a long look at the seats and
realized that the sliding/rotating base came off of the captain's seats.
Hmm...

With the bases off, the seats fit without my hitting my head on the roof of
the bus.  I had to drill four holes to accept the hold down bolts, but the
holes all missed the original brackets on the seat bases.  I can retrofit to
vanagon or other VW seats later.

The new seats are a little high.  If I wasn't almost 6' tall, I might not be
able to get the clutch pedal down enough to shift.  But we now have almost
&quot;new&quot; seats, reclining and with adjustable lumbar support.  Have to duck
sometimes to see traffic lights and I have only a few inches between me and
the steering wheel, but at least my butt is happy.

I had to remove the outer arm rests because of the aforementioned air duct
along the doors.  I've though about removing the ducts to let me re-install
the arms.  I'd much rather replace these seats with vanagon seats, but
haven't found a set at a good price yet.
