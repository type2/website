Subject: hydraulic valve adjustment

The first round of hydraulic valve adjustments on the rebuilt engine were as 
per Bentley.  After a 100 miles or so I readjusted them again as per Bentley.

After reading Bob Donalds information on hydraulic lifters I decide I would 
give it a try.  I reset them a couple of days ago with the engine cold to 
.006 ths and have run it for a few days around town and on the highway.

Should my next (and hopefully final) valve adjustment be on a cold or warm 
engine?  
Should I now use the 1/4 to 1/2 turn in after contact with valve setting or 
should I use Bentley's 2 full turns in?
