It could be the filter. I use a NAPA 1088 filter which gives me good oil 
pressure. It also has an anti-drainback valve.

Is the light on only at idle, or above 1,000 rpm?

&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;I guess that's where I left off six years ago
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Why did you stop?
&gt;
&gt;House remodel got in the way.  In fact, I oughtta' be on the roof instead
&gt;of working on this bus..........but we need a bus, and it can be at the
&gt;body shop while I'm on the roof.  That's the official excuse, anyway.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;Isn't it amazing how the brain fades with years of drug
&gt;&gt; &gt;abuse and abnormal sexual practices?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Umm... I don't remember.
&gt;
&gt;Funny how that is.  Isn't it?  8o}
&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;When I figure out where I stashed the seat belts, ten years ago,
&gt;&gt; &gt;I can venture out onto the road.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Just change the fluids.
&gt;
&gt;All fluids changed.  Seat belts located.  Now there's just the oil light
&gt;that won't go out.............swapped in two new pressure switches
&gt;without result.  I don't suppose the full-flow filter could be responsible
&gt;for that?  Sticking pressure relief valves?
&gt;

&gt;'70 Westy &quot;The Carcass&quot;                             for faults in the
