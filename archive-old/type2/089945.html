Subject: engine stand

Does anyone have any experience with the 750 pound=20
engine stand from Harbor Freight?  Seems like a good
price and shipping is only about $10.  Would I have
to fabricate/buy/modify anything to get this stand
to adapt to type 4 or type 1 engines?

Here'a a link to it: =

Thanks,

Rob
