&gt; For long term storage I agree... but I've also had good luck with a battery
&gt; tender - it monitors the battery and gives it a trickle charge when it needs
&gt; it.  I like to keep the battery in the vehicle so I can start it once in a
&gt; while &amp; you never know when you might get a really nice day and you want to
&gt; go for a ride.

I use Battery Tender Plus for charging. You can leave the battery on the
charger for weeks at a time but I don't like leaving items plugs in and left
alone.
