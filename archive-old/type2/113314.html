Subject: Re: [T2] 80 MPH Type 2

&gt; sometime when no one is around try stopping that beast at 80mph, while you
&gt; can make it go faster, getting it to stop is still 4,000lbs and 4 tires on
&gt; pavement without antilock etc, especially if you are running stock
&gt; tires....I refuse to drive mine faster than 65max and generally leave more
&gt; space between me and the vehicle in front, 3-4 second spacing minimum.

I don't remember what the exact specs were, but the Bay Window bus was always
praised for EXCELLENT stopping distances. Part of this is the narrow STOCK
tires with ALOT of weight over them. Wider tires create a larger surface to
slide on and distributes the weight over greater space. The reason you
hydroplane in water is that the contact surface becomes completely smooth.

Dragsters and race cars use smooth, very soft tires so they melt in the
pavement and give added traction - but they don't care about stopping!
