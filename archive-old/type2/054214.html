Okay,

So exactly how large a fuel tank do I have.  I left home for work this morning 
and grabbed the wrong key ring...the one without the gascap key.  The needle 
is sitting on the white line all the way left that marks the end of &quot;R&quot;. I go 
to gas station and go &quot;DOH!&quot;, as realize I've got no gas key.  So back home to 
swap key rings and then back to station. All in all about 15 miles since I 
started up this morning.

Gas pump receipt says 13.808 gallons in.

Question One:  Anyone have an estimate on how much further past &quot;R&quot; I had 
before I'm going leather express?

Question Two:  How big is the tank on a '76 FI Westy?
