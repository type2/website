Subject: Re: Engine Dies

Hey David...

This sounds like a classic example of a leak in the vacuum assist brake
system, or other vacuum leak.

One way to check this is to block the vacuum port on the intake manifold
(left side) where the vacuum assist hose runs towards the front to the
booster.  Block this off with some tape and have someone press on the
brake and see if the engine dies.  You might have an leak in your booster
diaphram, or a hole in the tubing along the length of the bus.

The other thing to do is spray some carb cleaner at different points where
there are gaskets or other fittings where parts meet (carb base, etc.).
See if any of the carb cleaner gets in past the leak and affects the
engine performance (sputtering or revving).

Other listees can verify or add to what I'm saying.  Or prove me totally
wrong if you have no vacuum assist at all:)

Cheers,

Tom
