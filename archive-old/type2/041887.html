&gt; Over time the lock mechanisms get clogged up with greasy dirt, debris, dog 
&gt; hair, etc.  By carefully prying off the trim panels you can access the lock 
&gt; mechanisms.  You can then clean them with a dose of WD-40, some clean rags, 
&gt; and perhaps, some compressed air (if needed).  Usually the WD-40 will float 
&gt; away the accumulated crud and your locks should function nicely again.  Good 
&gt; luck.

After you do this, make sure that the locks are truly freed up.  If
they're still stiff you'll break the cylinder itself.

The usual culprit for stiff locks isn't the cylinder itself, but the
breakage of a tiny spring on the latch mechinism.  This spring operates
a lever that allows you to lock the door from the inside by holding the
trigger while you close the door.  If the door will lock when you close it
without holding the outside trigger then you need to replace the spring.
For details see the library.
