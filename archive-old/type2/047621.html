&gt;to get tan Idea of how much the Insurance Company would value a 72
&gt;Restored Westy Camper. I understand that this value
&gt;is different than say Kelly Blue book value, any one know?

Hey Meredith,
As you know I was in 2 accidents back to back, and they valued my The 
SnoopyBus at around $3000 for everyone else a 73 daily driver that has seen 
better days.  There is a green book that lists values for classic cars, but 
good luck trying to get an insurance company to pay that.

You could also go to the http://www.fullmoonbusclub_dot_com webpage on the 
second page about 5 things down their is a link that says What is my bus 
worth. Click that and it has an estimate for buses in mint, good, and fair 
shape for may years.

Hope this helps.

Peace Brother,

Snoopy
