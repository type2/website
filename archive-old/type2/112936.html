Subject: &quot;Official Factory Microfiche Archived on CD-ROM&quot;

    After being amazed at how everybody is impressed at Richard's 
diagrams and watching everybody scratch their head over a silly little 
T-connector my curiosity was raised over this CD-Rom that Bentley has 
(recently?) put out featuring microfiches at a hefty cast of $99.  It 
sounds tempting considering how comprehensive it claims to be but I'd 
never never do anything too rash without consulting the list.  First, 
has anybody used this?  And to all you retailers out there... can you 
beat the price?

    From what I understand this disc covers all engines and transmissions:

        This one is type two specific and would cover my '76:
        http://www.bentleypublishers_dot_com/product.htm?code=VFT2&amp;subject=20

        I personally think microfiche are useful.  It would be nice to 
have more than what is in the bentley manual and currently available on 
the web.  I just don't know how comprehensive these CDs are.

    Poke around and there's something for everyone.
