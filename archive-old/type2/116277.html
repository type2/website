Subject: Overhead AC

It's interesting that you mention that. I've been considering installing A/C
in my transporter since I got it. It's more or less for HER, than it would
be for me. One of the ones I've seen was pretty large actually. It attached
to both overhead bars in the roof and had something like 8 or 9 air vents
comming out the sides. It was an off-white, and I found it in an old 1971
Transporter.
The other one I've seen was MUCH smaller, and I DID see it in a Westfalia.
It looked like maybe a 1973+ Westfalia.. Orange, with the matching plaid
orange interior. This one, while it was smaller, looked EXACTLY like the one
in the 1971 Transporter, but it was shorter by about half the length.

Other than that, the only other A/C system I've seen was one that I snagged.
It was an extension of the dash-board... it ACTUALLY attaches to the
underside of the factory dash. It contains the A/C radiator thingys (?? what
are they called?) and about 6 A/C vents. I also grabbed the matching BOSCH
A/C compressor too. Luckily enough, the clutch on the compressor seems to be
fine. I didn't get the lines though.. :( 
Luckily enough, the A/C control unit that I got matches the dash of my car
TO THE T! It's made out of the same material... I'd guess it was factory
except that there's a little emblem on it that says PBI or something... 
Even the buttons match the dash!

Subject: Overhead AC

All this talk of consoles and the pic that was posted got me thinking about
the 
stock overhead AC system for the bus. Does anybody know if it will fit in a 
Westy? I've found one in my local boneyard in good condition and was
thinking 
about the feasability of installing it.
