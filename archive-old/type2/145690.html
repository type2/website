Subject: oil temp sensor

Hi Guys.  I got out my new jack and stands today and did a few  things to the bopmobile.  Fixed the horn.  Old one was bad  but that wasn't my only problem.  After a bunch of measuring  voltages and continuity I ended up pulling off the steering  wheel.  The contact was bent.  Easy fix and I now have a loud  horn.  Luckily the local foreign car parts store stocks  them.  But I hate giving them my money.  Lots of bad  experiences with them. 
  
  Next I changed the oil and wired up my new oil temp sensor/sender that  goes in the drain plug.  Only problem is, it's not the right  type.  It just has a flat side.  My plug has a little  recessed piece that fits up on a nipple where the oil drains.  I  hadn't noticed that before.  So the sender won't fit on  there.  I'm planning on calling BD monday morning but does anybody  know why I got the wrong one?  I only showed them listing  one.  I'll check again.  Now I've got a gauge and a wire but  no sender.  Thanks and cheers...KR
