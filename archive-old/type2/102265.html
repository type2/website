Subject: Starter Problem

I was loosening one of the nuts on the solenoid that hold the + wires onto 
the starter when the nut came off with half of the screw inside of it. Is 
there a way to screw a new stud onto this solenoid or do I need a new 
solenoid all together. Please tell me there is a way.

Yhanks Casey
