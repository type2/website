Subject: Re: [T2] Early Bay Rear Bumper - What year bus??

quote

&quot;&quot;Andy said that the push button front door handles were from the '68
model.
I can see from your linked brochure that the bus with the guy driving has
push button door handles.  Your link indicates this is a '70 brochure.&quot;&quot;



Beware the pictures on the brochures.
&quot;Anything Goes&quot; was the theme of the graphics department.
There is no telling what mix and match graphics showed up in any brochure.
