Subject: Re: [T2] Oil light flickers on new rebuild.

Wow Jake! Lots of questions. Thanks for the input!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Did you use a regrind cam, used cam/new lifters? Itis normal for
&gt; the cam to settle a bit but thats a little much.

The cam and lifters were both new. So were the adjustment screws and I noted
that the ends on some of them were not uniform as some had a dome and some
were more &quot;pointed&quot; on the contact surface. I actually filed the point down
a but on a couple of them before installation.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Ws this a new case? used case? what machine work was done if it was a
used case?

The case was used from the 1971 DP bus. Universal Mexican case that was in
that bus when I bought it around 1983. It was bored .020 for new bearings.
Does that sound right?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Whats your compression ratio set at? ignition timing _at_ full advance?
how black is the tail pi[pe or plugs?

Compression ratio 7.5:1 Timing set at 28 degrees maximum advance. I did not
notice the tail pipe or look at the plugs yet.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What weight oil are you using?

Run in was done with straight 30w oil. I put it straight 40w after the run
in (Paranoia again).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; How did they balance it, static or dynamic? If they balanced it
dynamic and did it corrrectly the flywheel and pressure plate should have
been indexed
&gt; (marked by them) so the two could be mated as balanced. Balancing is a
tough
&gt; thing without the right equipment. Did you take them all the rotating
parts
&gt; including flywheel, pressure plate and pulley along with the crank  rods
and
&gt; pistons?

The crank was balanced dynamically on a machine. I asked about marks when I
picked it up and the shop owner explained that the parts were balanced
individually. That troubled me some at the time, but what do I know? The
pistons were balanced on an electronic scale as were the rods. The shop has
a good reputation but they *did* press on the wrong timing gear which cost
me one days work. Now I wonder if there was some mix up and I actually have
someone else's crank. No way to find out at this point. What will the mild
rpm dependant vibration mean in the long run?

Thanks!

&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; After 20-minute run in and then a short 5-mile drive, I waited until
today
&gt; &gt; to readjust the valves cold. All were loose except one. They were set at
&gt; &gt; .006 before run in and short drive. Today were .009 to .013. The one
&gt; &gt; exception was .004. I figured the opposite would be found today. All
were
&gt; &gt; set back to .006.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Did you use a regrind cam, used cam/new lifters? Itis normal
for
&gt; the cam to settle a bit but thats a little much.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Anyhow, I took her on a road trip to continue the break-in today. Nice
&gt; &gt; conditions with hilly roads some stop lights. Many different rpms and
&gt; &gt; speeds, up and down moderate hills (except Boyd Smith's driveway- a
&gt; mountain
&gt; &gt; goat would get winded). After about 20-25 miles, I pulled into my dad's
&gt; &gt; driveway and at idle, the oil light started to flicker. It would go away
&gt; &gt; when revved a bit. The temperature was only about 210 degrees.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Ws this a new case? used case? what machine work was done if it
&gt; was a used case?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  After the
&gt; &gt; drive back, this did not occur, but is had cooled outside and the
&gt; &gt; temperature only went up to about 180. Any ideas about that?
&gt; &gt; This may seem very paranoid (build an engine for the first time and I
dare
&gt; &gt; you to not be that way), but the bus *seemed* to use more gas looking/
&gt; &gt; watching the gauge.
&gt;
&gt; Whats your compression ratio set at? ignition timing _at_ full advance? how
&gt; black is the tail pi[pe or plugs?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  I wonder if some gas is getting into the oil to make it
&gt; &gt; thinner. How can I tell? After the 20 min. run in, I changed the oil and
&gt; it
&gt; &gt; *seemed* thin (very unscientific I know but I have changed the oil when
&gt; warm
&gt; &gt; before).
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What weight oil are you using?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I also appear to have an engine vibration at a certain RPM. I am
&gt; &gt; disappointed with that as I had the whole thing balanced at the machine
&gt; &gt; shop
&gt; How did they balance it, static or dynamic? If they balanced it dynamic
and
&gt; did it corrrectly the flywheel and pressure plate should have been indexed
&gt; (marked by them) so the two could be mated as balanced. Balancing is a
tough
&gt; thing without the right equipment. Did you take them all the rotating
parts
&gt; including flywheel, pressure plate and pulley along with the crank  rods
and
&gt; pistons?
&gt;
&gt; . I have no tach installed so can not tell exactly what engine speed
&gt; &gt; this occurs. Occurs at about 28mph in third gear and about 40 mph in
&gt; fourth.
&gt; &gt; I guess I will have to live with that.
&gt; Give us some answers and we'll try to help you.
