Subject: Double Cab Questions
Date: Tue, 6 Feb 2001 08:55:30 -0800 
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

		I have been looking at some DCs the last few days, and not
finding much. I have seen some though that they call &quot;Binz&quot; Double Cabs.
What is this, I see it on the older ones (50's-60's)
		Also, anyone know of any DCs for sale any year, any
condition? I would prefer a 68+, but am open to any. 
		Now for a hard question, has anyone ever converted a Bus
into a Double cab? How did it look? I have seen one splitty converted, but
the rear treatment was poorly done. If I do something like this, I will want
it to look good and retain factory body lines and may even use a double cab
door and side window. I have all the tools, some experience and a shop. It
would be possible for me to do, but I would like to learn from others first.
I have done a bunch of work on the computer with drawings I have of Buses, I
played around and it will look O.K.
		Right now I am just exploring.
