Subject: [T2] NEED Square port MSHP Stage 2 head

Well I wasn't going to, I was just going to sell the damn '82.
Then I cleaned it all up to sell this weekend and realized I don't
want to, it's to damn nice and I like the auto tranny.

This means I must rebuild the MSHP engine as it is unliveable
with a stock 2.0.  Although I can probably whittle something out
myself and get Eurorace to do the seats, I figure whay the hey.

If anyone has got a used in good condition &quot;Stage 2&quot; Stephens
head with say under 50k miles that will pass inspection as uncracked
solid in good shape with 42x36 valves, and ideally around 60cc in
the chamber, I WANT IT.

I'll give a reasonable amount commensurate with condition and
use.  Say $150-$300 depending.
