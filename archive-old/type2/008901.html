Y'All,

This recent thread of resto-ing Jalousies got me
thinking.... 

I was choosing to stay quiet, thinking that far wiser
folks (Ken Hooper,et all...) would give better answers
than I ever could,... and.....nothing.

Then it occurred to me. Maybe this list works like
*real* life!.... 

Some people understand and know how to rebuild a VW
motor (God help me, I wish I did!!!), while some of us
know how to clean a pop-top...
-or-
repair/resto Jalousies (or anything else, for that
matter)...


So...since so many of us have web-sites that are
type-II related....why not specialize? Why not link to
one-another? Why not &quot;organize&quot; our skills/knowledge
to make this data-base (also known as the type II
list) a FAR more powerful tool?


SERIOUSLY!!!! 

Joe Clark has the &quot;Definitive Type-II Tent&quot; page, and
he doesn't even sell them!!! He does it out of: a)
interest, b) passion, c) perversion, or some
combination of the above! 

Dawn at PLF has info on her canvas, but also offers
advice to those who choose to buy other products...

Todd Hill makes his living rebuilding trannies, but
look at all the info he's given for free...

George is an electronics (as well as just about
ANYTHING VW-related *freak* &lt;I mean that well!&gt;)...

Mike G. Benthin seems to be the source for Type IV
info....


I could go on and on. There is *infinite* info on this
list: it comes from the members! Why not make a
web&lt;site&gt;-ring that deals with that?

Lots of us have web-sites devoted to busses...

SOME even offer good info on those pages...

BUT....

But, we all deal with our individual ISP's and they
give 10 megs (at best) for web pages. 

WELL....10 MEGS is a lot, when used properly. It gives
you the chance for a *LOT* of photos as well as a
*LOT* *MORE* script. At least for a personal web-page.

NOW.....If we all had our personal web-pages and
devoted the &quot;memory&quot; space wisely....

We could conceivably negate the TypeII Archive
altogether. It would be replaced by individual
web-pages spotlighting what we've done for our busses
as individuals.

That would free-up a LOT of band-width for Type-II. It
could make this list move more smoothly.


Well...what do you all think?


This is *SO* easily do-able! 

By the way... for anyone interested in this idea who
doesn't have a scanner....I do. I will scan your
related photos for free. They will, of course, be
free-domain, RIGHT?
