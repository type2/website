Hey Randall,
	I don't know the details about the Pert. ignition, but with the
Crane that I have you'd better not use a Bosch Blue Boy!  It has an internal
ballast resistor which is a definite no-no.  I'm running a crane coil as
well.  If I'm way off on that point, perhaps the brand of cap/rotor is the
issue.  I was in the AP biz for years, and I have discovered that not all
tune up parts are created equal.  I'd stick with the allmighty Bosch, the
Nascar/Borg-Warner, NAPA's Echlin line, Accel, etc.  Stick with something of
quality.  Many are just plasticky junk, but the Big Boys use heat resistant
materials, and the B-W stuff even has brass contacts.  I've also replaced my
cap with a watercooled equivalent that has posts instead of holes for the HV
wires.

Hey List,

I'm running a stock distributor and Pertronix ignition on my 1978 2.0L with
fuel injection.  I finished rebuilding the engine and have been driving it
regularly for about 3,500 miles.  This weekend it wouldn't start so I pulled
the distributor cap to find the rotor burnt to a crisp and the cap full of
welding slag.  I replaced the cap and rotor with new ones and drove about
150 miles home.  I checked it when I got home and it looked fine, but what
would have caused this?  Do I need a California emission/electronic ignition
cap and rotor with the Pertronix?  It already has a new Bosch blue coil.
The bus has been running great and timing is in spec.  Any help is greatly
appreciated. 

Thanks,

Randall and Kermit (The lean, mean, green machine)
