Hi,

&gt; I'm planning on simply soldering in an extension and heavily electrical
&gt; taping the connections.  Does this sound alright? Am I doomed? Will it work?

 You may find it difficult to solder heavy guage wires, as they conduct heat so well that it's difficult to get them hot enough for the solder to flow properly. I suggest getting some serious cable connectors, the ones that are like a short tube with a couple of screws to hold the cables, and using those. Get as much contact area as you can to improve current flow. I might use a section of bicyle inner tube and some tie wraps to insulate it, as insulating tape may come adrift with heat. Hey, use both!

Cheers,
        W.
