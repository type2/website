Hi again -

Yes, it's me, the guy w/the GEX engine (belay the reply, I've been 
thoroughly forewarned).  As I've told a few people, I don't have the time or 
money to turn back now.  The reason?  Of a personal nature, so call me a 
schmuck, but my circumstances dictate that I get moving now.  Essentially, 
time is of the essence RIGHT NOW, &amp; I can always get more money (no, I don't 
particularly care to throw it away)  Maybe I can serve as a test (dummy?) 
subject to check latest standards of GEX.

Good Dr. Tim recommended checking the &quot;crankshaft endplay.&quot;  I have the 
Hayes, &amp; think I have an idea of what you're referring to, Doc.  It sounds 
like I'd have to break open the case to do this, yes?  Anything else I might 
be able to inspect, to give me a better feeling?

So:  forging ahead, against the advice of many.  I have some more install 
questions, and would be most appreciative of list member input.  A few folks 
said:  yes, put the cooling tins/engine compartment seal on before putting 
back in.  OK - BUT, this sounds difficult.  What about the &quot;shaft&quot; that goes 
between the transmission &amp; the engine (don't know the common name/couldn't 
seem to find in Hayes).  Is there any special way this should be installed 
into the motor &amp; the tranny?  Will there be any problems w/this while 
jacking the motor back into the compartment?  Any tricks y'all know of?  I'm 
just thinking of how far we (my buddy &amp; I) had to back the motor out of the 
tranny (w/tin already removed) to get &quot;that shaft&quot; clear.  With the tin on 
before installation, it doesn't seem like I'll have enough play to slide it 
in there, also considering the angle.

If anyone knows of a website w/pics of the process or has pics they could 
e-mail me, that would be most helpful.

Tom &amp; Dana - thanks guys.  I think I might be able to get a few pics into 
the &quot;digital medium.&quot;  I'd be most appreciative if you would take a look.  
Plus, then I'll have some on file should I need them for a warranty matter.  
I guess I won't mess w/the EGR until I've taken the pics.  Where, exactly, 
is the dime-sized thingy to indicate an overheated condition?

A most apprehensive, but equally grateful,

Mark
