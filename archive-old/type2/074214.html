Subject: vacuum dizzy

I found an old dual vac dizzy for a 74 that has been sitting on an engine
outside for some time.  Would this be usable?  What would I need to check?
I know I would have to replace the condenser, points etc...  But if the
shaft spins and the vac is still good, do you think the dizzy is good?

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
