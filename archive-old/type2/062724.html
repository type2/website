&gt;  some panels just need to be replaced, and not patched... rockers on
&gt; &gt;both sides, and the piece in front of the rear wheels on both sides.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;So that's my question, I guess... who should I buy them from? Right now,
&gt; &gt;the only catalog I have with panels in it is JC Whitney... I know a lot
&gt; &gt;of people have bad stories about them, but I've never really had a
&gt; &gt;problem...
&gt; 
&gt; I posted a similar request a week or so back, and all replies but one
&gt; said to go with parts from Das Bulli Haus, which you can access from
&gt; Thom Fitzpatricks web page.    One person said Rocky Mountain Motor
&gt; Works was great to work with, but that parts didn't fit esp.  well.  From
&gt; my browsing I know that JCW's prices are only a little lower than
&gt; RMMW's and I'd be leery of buying body panels from them.  As for
&gt; Das Bulli Haus, I emailed a request for a parts list, so we'll see.

You can see all the parts, and their prices, on the web, too... thanks 
to a wonderful setup.
