Subject: front triangular window

Hello List!

My front triangular window (vent window?) was busted (and my radio stolen).
Looking at it I'm not sure how the assembly comes out - do I tear the seal
out to get to some screws or do I remove the door panel to get to some
screws?  Are these junk yard items?  Thanks in advance!!
