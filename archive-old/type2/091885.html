Subject: Re: [T2] fuel pump/FI question of the day

That is the correct operation.  When the engine first kicks over the 
flap of the air flow sensor will move slightly to where it now contacts 
the plate and signal is sent to the double relay to power the fuel pump.
the pump should not run in acc position.

&gt; On a stock '77 bus, when you turn the key to the first (accessory)

&gt; I have come to live with this condition over the years, but I just 
&gt; switched intake air sensers(AFM) and now it no longer happens.
&gt; The old AFM tested out of spec and the pump ran with key in accessory 
&gt; position.
&gt; The new(used) AFM tests in spec as per bentleys terminal tests, but the 
&gt; fuel pump does not run.  Can you guys verify that it is correct for the 
&gt; fuel pump NOT to run until the starter is turned(Bentley says it gets 
&gt; it's first signal from the starter.)
