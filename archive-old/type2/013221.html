&gt; Hi and THANKS to everyone that has helped me in the quest to getting my 
&gt; 78 bus running.  Just one problem, its still not running.  It turns 
&gt; over and gets fuel but will not start, not even a putter.  I've tried a 
&gt; bunch of stuff, such as testing the FI, Starter, seloniod, distributor, 
&gt; spark plugs, combi-relay, compression test(on a cold engine) and some 
&gt; other smaller stuff.  Actually, My next step is to check the ignition 
&gt; switch.

if it turns over, it's not the ignition switch.

It sounds like it's not getting a spark.  This assumes that it's getting 
fuel, as you mentioned above.

&gt; My Question is;  Could my problem be valve related??Could the valves 
&gt; cause the engine not to start?? The engine sounds ok.  No odd noises, 
&gt; grinding or loud pops.  I'm not sure what I should try next.   Does 
&gt; anyone have any idea how to fix this problem????  Please help!!  Thanks 
&gt; Mike.

have you verified that it's getting a spark by having a friend turn the 
engine over while you do something
silly like hold a spark plug wire near a ground and watch the spark arch 
to the ground?

Are the spark plug wires:

a) on the right plugs
b) on the plugs and cap tight

even if one of these were wrong, the engine should try to catch and you 
should hear it...


When you turn the car over, does the rotor turn?

those are just some places to start...
