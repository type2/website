Subject: A Few New Goodies from Europe

A quick note to those who bought (or plan to buy) the rear hatch window Jail
Bars that we have been carrying from Just Kampers...  I now have the
matching side window jail bars in stock:

Also I have brought in an assortment of special VW Bus commemorative items
produced by Haynes/UK (of Haynes Manual fame).,  These feature the cut-away
image of a Bus found on the Haynes manual cover.  There are drinking
glasses, coffee mugs, lunch boxes, wallets, key chains, playing cards, drink
coasters, and notepads.  You can find them throughout the Gifts section:
