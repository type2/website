Subject: cat converter and canvas

------=_NextPart_001_0000_01C1FD2D.E5B84920

If I understand correctly, from 79 on all CA model buses and all non CA m=
odel buses came with catalytic converters.  But the CA cat is different f=
rom the non CA cat.  The crossover pipe and heat exchangers are different=
 also.  Does any one know what the difference is or why they are differen=
t.

Also, I posted a few days ago about sewing a poptop canvas.  I learned to=
day that Joann Fabrics has outdoor canvas and duck cloth on sale both for=
 $4.99 a yard.  I am going to try to use the old canvas as a template.  H=
ow hard/time consuming is it to remove and install the canvas.  Any one h=
ave any thoughts, recommendations, or concerns.

Thanks,
Kyle
