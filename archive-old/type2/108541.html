Subject: Re: [T2] Flat seal

Mine actually came a little long and needed some trimming. Its been on for
about three months and I havn't noticed any shrinking yet. Did you get the
push on with the clips or the glue type? Maybe someone was a little stingy
with the ruler that day. I cant think of any way of stretching that would
not shrink back to original size.

&gt; Did anyone get a flat seal from BD and it came a little short? I thought I
&gt; stretched it enough but are there any tricks for elongating it? Is it
going
&gt; to shrink over time and look like this anyway?
