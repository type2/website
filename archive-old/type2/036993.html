Subject: RE: Bay Sheet Metal (was: Engine Hatch Hinges)

 &gt; Multiply by 1.62 last I checked, so like $40.50 and they have to pay this
&gt; jaw-dropping 25% sales tax, but we don't--so it amounts to prices you'd
&gt; expect for Mexican rustbait IF the shipping does not kill you.


And therein lies the problem.  Sheet metal is oddly shaped and generally
rather large, so it takes up a rather large amount of space even when it
isn't worth very much.  Shippers base their charges on &quot;dimensional weight,&quot;
meaning that an item that takes up X amount of space will be charged based
on a certain minimum weight, even if its actual weight is much lower than
that. Add to this the fact that it is rather fragile and easily dented,
requiring careful packing that takes up even more space. The result is that
on sheet metal, shipping costs tend to be disproportionately high relative
to the cost of the item. To put it another way, it would cost as much to
import $5000 worth of brake shoes as it would to import $500 worth of sheet
metal, since in the former case you are mostly shipping product, whereas
with the sheet metal you are mostly shipping air.  The cost difference is
even larger when you are bringing in a small amount (i.e. a few busses
worth) of items; when dealing with a large shipment like a 20-40 ft
container it tends to even out somewhat since you're working with averages.
For this reason, I usually order the compact, more valuable stuff first,
then fill the rest of the container with as much sheet metal as space will
allow.  This is the only way to get it here at a low cost, because in a
sense the more compact items subsidize the sheet metal (which otherwise
would have been uneconomical to import).
