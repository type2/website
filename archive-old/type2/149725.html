Subject: Comment and question.

Its Friday so I wanted to offer this: I have never seen a better community 
of communicative individuals. Not working on a college campus, not in many 
families.  For the most part even when people have something to say that i 
don't want to hear, they have said it and been respectful, nice and truely 
concerned.

Someone is looking to purchase my AW for what i have into her.  Even though 
she looks perfect for me, I think I might need something that has less 
tragedy surrounding it and thats less of a handful of work.  Anyone have an 
opinion?

Even if I do sell the current van, I would like to get one that I can handle 
a little better (spend the money and get some &quot;context and history&quot; from the 
buyer) and then get some dub buddies, cause you guys rock. seriously.  I 
want to be more helpful to everyone so after I learn more, I will help the 
best i can.

Some
