Dave,

The FI is significantly better at reliablity.  It is significantly better
at gas mileage.  It may be slightly better at acceleration performance,
depending on air temperature and humidity.

I have a '78 engine and FI installed in my '73 body.  It can be done.  It
has been some years, so I have probably forgotten a couple items but here
is what I remember having to flop:

main wiring harness (to get the wiring for the fuel pump)
gas tank
gas tank fire  wall
fuel pump
trans support bar  (FI throttle comes out in a different place)
throttle cable

sheet metal work:
mount for air cleaner
cut hole for FI brain

I was going for as stock a conversion as I could get, and it does look
good.  When I take it to a shop, I can say &quot;treat it as a stock '78&quot; and
that works.

If you have a donor bus on hand, I highly recommend going FI.  If you
don't, I suggest sticking with dual carbs.  Living where I do, in the
cool wet mid-atlantic region, I don't like the single carb conversions
because they have no provision to prevent icing in the intake manifold
runners... and those are *long* runners!  If you live in AZ or in SoCal,
you can probably get away with it, but not here.
