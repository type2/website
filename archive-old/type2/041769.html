Subject: New engine, part 2

Compression test came out ok on my troubled engine:  107, 116, 105, 112.
I still suspect a vacuum leak somewhere, I even think I can hear it in the
engine compartment, but can't track it down.  I've blocked off the decel
valve, brake booster, aux air regulator and EGR valve.  Covering the vacuum
hole that goes to the fuel pressure reg. seems to bump engine speed a bit.
How do I go about looking for a crankcase vacuum leak?  Where can they
occur?  Cylinder 2 is still not alive.  I've driven the beast about 50 feet
and it seems like I could drive it around the block, but it'd probably stall
at every stop sign.  I've retorqued the exhaust system (which loosened up a
bit after initial run-in).  Now I'm giving up for the day.  Come Monday I
think I'll take it to a mechanic, or maybe sell it.  This is not going the
way I was hoping it would.  Any kind souls in Berkeley feel like making a
house call tomorrow or tonight to help me out?  Maybe bring a vacuum gauge
and a fuel pressure gauge and some knowledge?

Later volks,
Niall
