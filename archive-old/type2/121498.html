Subject: Re: [T2] To New York- Mid Trip Update

Well in that condition 50 mph might be pretty scary. However in 100% 
condition these German vehicles are designed for the Autobahn and 100% 
speed. That means they are ready for 70 MPH. Being they are a bit aged 
these days 60-65 mph is still prob reasonable...



&gt;Guess I just don't give the Bus enough credit!
