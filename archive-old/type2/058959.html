&gt;Anybody know why the front brake caliper has two bleeding tubes?

If you're just wanting to bleed the air out of the system, you only need
to use the upper bleed valve (air rises to the top).  If you want to
completely flush your system, use the lower one (contaminants tend to
settle to the bottom) and then after you've got clean fluid in there,
use the upper one to bleed out the air.
