Subject: VW CDROM Campaign Update

Hi y'all

        Well, we've recieved a lot of inquiries into the air-cooled VW cdrom
campaign, unfortunately not enuf yet to spark any interest in management.

        In trying a different tack, I changed the way requests are
submitted.  Instead of ending up in one guys mailbox, to possibly rot there
forever, I set up an account (hey, I _am_ the SysAdmin) for the requests to
funnel into, as well as being forwarded to the product guy.  In addition,
I'll recieve a copy of it, and you'll get a cute auto-reply message.  This
will give me better control of the project.

        We are gearing up for an &quot;amateur&quot; version of the product, and a
couple other product offerings, so they may be much more receptive to this
idea than previously.

        So, even if you've already submitted a request, or are not sure if
you'd actually need the product, please submit a request under my new system.  

        Thanks for the help!

        PS: We are also hiring database editors: they want people with lots
of shop experience who can also use computers.  Lemme know if you're
interested in applying.  I think the pay starts in the mid $30k or so.  My
work email is thom_at_alldata_dot_com.
