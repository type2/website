&gt;I have a junk 1970 tranny- can this (bell hasusing with a starter) be
&gt;made to fit a later engine like a 75 or a 78???

If an SR17X or 15X starter will fit those years, then an earilier bell
housing should work, with spacers on the lower engine/tranny stud and a
longer bolt for the upper engine/starter/tranny hole.

One issue crossing those years is length of the mainshaft, but that would
not be in play here as a starter adaptor only. The other is length of
engine studs for the thicker bellhousing on the later T-II's. But I
confirmed the same starter will fit 67-82 T-II's, both T-I and T-IV
engines, and also includes 67-79 Beattle T-I's. This would be a universal
adaptor, benefit of the continuity designed in by aforethought of German
Neandereering. Same reason a front wheel bearing for a 53 356 Porsche was
still stock on 89 911's. In fact, since the SR17X is stock for 912/911
Porsche motors as well, this early Beattle/Bus bellhousing adaptor would
also interface with all Porsche air cooled, with perhaps the same stud/bolt
matching issues.

A early tranny case, Bus or Beattle, will need spaces to mount on the
later, longer bolt/stud motors. If you use a later bellhousing, the early
motor studs won't reach. You would have to pull the early stud and put in a
longer one and use a longer bolt for the upper, then put the stock stud
back in to use on the long stud latter engine interface. Get an early
bellhousing for the easier universal use across all years via use of
spacers on the lower longer stud and an early short bolt or later long bolt
with spacers on the upper starter bolt.

So, a 70 tranny bellhousing, bus or beattle, would do the job for some 20
years span of VW/Porsche starter/motor/tranny interface. If either an SR15X
or SR17X is shown as stock or alternate on the Bosch list, this early
bellhousing adaptor will work.
