Might have to tear it down
to
find out where it's binding. Also that compression is questionable at best
anyway
so maybe a rebuild is in order.

Seems to be the general consensus I am getting from the list.  Driving it
with the problems it was having must have done some damage to it.  I guess
I'll pull the motor, and rebuild it in the shop.  It could have used it
anyway.

Thanks folks!  I'll update on what I find when I get there.
