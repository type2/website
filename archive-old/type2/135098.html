Subject: Re: [T2] Installing a BN2 heater in a Westy

I had a '73 Westy that had the heater in the back where the second battery 
went.
It continued forward a bit of course.
I never had any trouble with it, but the guy that bought the camper from me 
did.
The bus went up in flames in the night about 6 months after he bought it.
Shudder...

| Does the proximity of the wood and the flame not scare you?
|
| Why not under the bus between the frame rails?
|
| Build a splash shield to keep it dry. Send the heated air through the 
central trunk or into the rear floorboard outlet.
