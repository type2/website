&gt; What years are your buses....I picked up 4x8 plywood before I started
&gt; working on my bus last year and it was *not* a tight fit at all...at least
&gt; an inch or so on each side cause I measured it before i went.

Mine is about an eighth of an inch on each side, if you find the right
height!  Another good reason to have a roof rack!

OTOH, the yard boys at the lumber yard were amazed that a 4x8 sheet fit at
all!

&gt; Hmmm...maybe I need to go measure again(78 champagne edition).

&gt; George, have you got pics of the devices that slide into the jack
&gt; points?  THis sounds like the coolest thing yet....I can envision what
&gt; it would look like, but pics would be nice!

No pics, as I only saw it once.  really simple, though.  Just pieces of
square tubing that slid into the jack points, secured by a pin behind the
jack point.  The outer end of the tubing had a 3&quot; piece of flat stock
welded on projecting upward.  The flat stock had a hole drilled in it for
the tiedown, which extends up to the drip rail.

The way I saw it used, a sheet of plywood was placed on the hooks, a
blanket was laid across the top of the plywood to protect the paint, and
two nylon tiedown straps were used between the &quot;hooks&quot; and the drip rail
to secure the load.

I don't think I would want to take this on the freeway without securing
the load better, but for around town it looked like a good setup.
