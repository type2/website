Subject: I've had it up to my fuel filler neck with gas smell....

Folks -
couple of qeustions. I have a '78 with a torn fuel filler neck. I bought a 
stock, non restricting replacement, #211201119, but it turns out that's not 
what I currently have on the bus. I think it has an inner and outer sleeve 
that fit over the metal fuel filler pipe, and the neck does taper down to a 
smaller diameter hole with a metal ring in it. What kind of neck does a '78 
normally have? Any one familar with this, have a part # and instrx on how to 
replace? I tried just pulling it out, but I didn't try really hard once I 
realised the replacement part I'd bought didn't match.

I just bought a Bentley, and was bummed at the lack of information in the 
Fuel system. No specific diagrams for fuel lines and the breather lines for 
a late bay. Any one have better diagrams? I've seen Richard's picture of 
fuel breather lines, but are there other diagrams, and how about the filler 
neck?

My bus has been sitting for two months since I broke my ankle and it's 
developed  STRONG fuel odor. I slid under the other day, and even though I'm 
not seeing any leakage, I get a pretty significant smell under the fuel pump 
and filter. Think that's just from sitting?

If anyone's interested, I'll sell the bus, but in the meantime I'm going to 
work on it as time and money allow. I'm in New Hampshire.

Thanks
Mat
