Subject: Re: What to see

&gt;Between Arizona and Louisiana there is nothing to see [except] Grand
&gt;Canyon...next stop
&gt;New Orleans..

Oh, quit. There is, too.

- --Santa Fe, NM: Oldest state capitol in the US. A very fine town with a lot
to do (free!) on the Square. Walk Canyon Road, free parking anywhere you
choose to leave the bus.

- --Taos, NM: Take the route north from Albuquerque that is not interstate
(don't remember the number). This takes you through Madrid and Cerrillos.
Cerrillos is the home of the finest, bestest saloon in the US. Madrid is a
decaying mining town. You'll end up in Santa Fe. From there,

- --North on two-lane past Chimayo, through Truchas. Astonishing views.
You'll wet your pants. I'm not kidding. Up to Penasco then over to Taos.
This is the route Eddie H. took to Taos the other day. Ask him if I'm
exaggerating.

- --Taos; skip the town because it's a tourist trap. Go on up to the Wheeler
Peak (about 14,000 feet). Nothing to see my foot. This is the most gorgeous
contry on the Earth.

- --Back south by way of Velarde and Nambe, winding beside the Rio Grande
where it really is grand. Watch for the canyon on the right upon leaving
Taos. You can drive to it/through it if you watch close (I don't believe
it's marked but there is a dirt road). Well worth it.

- --DO NOT STOP at Espanola. Muy mala. Just drive through.

- --Over to the country above Los Alamos if you have time, back to I-40 if
you don't.

Public campgrounds are practically unknown in New Mexico. I know where a
few are, ask me, but there are no reliable facilities (read &quot;bathrooms&quot;).
Your best bet is to be self-contained (read &quot;not very modest&quot;).
