Subject: [T2]Re: 1600 T3 in a 78 Westy Q's ...let me explain...

 Well... I can see from the many replys, off list and
on,that I wasnt clear in the original post of my
intentions... or maybe I was just mistaken...
 Anyways... first off... this aint my first rodeo when
it comes to T4 powerplants.... the race buggy had a T4
that I built... dyno'd right _at_ 165 horse... right
where I wanted it... a good decent HP to weight ratio,
but it was also very dependable...
 And have built my share of stock ones too... 
But... you can ask anyone that knows me.... Ill hop in
the truck, bug, bike... whatever, in a heartbeat, and
not think twice about a 1000+ mile trip... now dont
get me wrong... there is a fair amount of spares/parts
that I tote everywhere I go... be it across town, or
cross country... 
 The 78 Westy DOES/WILL HAVE the 2000 in it, altho not
FI'd yet... but it will be soon. I fired it up (with a
carb) a week or so ago... and it was pouring oil from
the cooler/PR tubes/VC's/oil filter mount.... so its
getting all new seals in it as we speak... well not as
we speak... but Ill get out there sumtime tonight...
funny how seals go bad after setting on a shelf for 23
years....
 Heres the reason for the T3 in a 78 bus Q's... Was in
NM last weekend in the 62 SC, broke a part that NEVER
breaks (who really carries a rocker arm/shaft
washers/and clips with em)... set me back about 5 or 6
hours tryin to patch/rig sumthing up so I could be on
my way... If Id had a spare engine with me,even a long
block with no cooling tin... I couldve been back on
the road in 1-2 hours tops... that engine I can
lift/move... it aint got the power of a 2L... but it
has more power than a dead 2L... all Im doin is lookin
ahead &quot;incase&quot; the magic smoke gets let out of the
2L... If theres a T3 engine (T3 is the choice cause of
no doghouse, thus easier to store) then all I gotta do
is uninstall the dead 2L...let it hit the ground, and
tose that T3 in, and Im back on the road...
 Im crippled up pretty good from a crash in 89... dont
get around to good anymore... and I sure cant strike
off walking 5 or 10 or more miles to see if I can find
an oil filter bracket that just got scored from
something that the tire picked up and threw at it
crackin it clean into...when I break down... thats
where Im at... I have no choice but to rig sumthin up
to be on my way... if possible:) Im at the mercy of
the &quot;highway gods&quot;... Im glad thier good friends with
the &quot;VW gods&quot;:)
 A T4 engine I cant lift... its just to durn
heavy...well... I take that back.... it only took me
two days to get the 2L in the bus... by myself, at the
house, with sufficient light/heat/food... but on the
side if the highway, at night, with cars flyin by a
few feet from your feet... I dont think so.
 All that is trying to be accomplished is to get to a
shop/FLAPS/phone/friends/or better yet home....so
&quot;proper&quot; repairs can be made... home is the best
bet... in the shop is 5 complete 2L FI engines that
were pulled when the engines were fairly new, a couple
of 18s w/carbs... etc... if there were a place to
store one in/on a bus, AND if I could lift one, that
would be the way to go.... but there aint, and I cant.
Been a member of the AIRS list since its conception...
helped many a folk over the years... but Ive always
been self sufficient, there for the bus should be
too:)
 I didnt mean for this to get into a &quot;OH MY GOD... hes
puttin a 1.6 in a 78 bus&quot; scare... just wanted to know
what to do to the engine to prep it for an install in
the bus tranny... and I still havent found out:) The
main thing is the starter to flywheel to clutch to TO
bearing combo... not sure if I gotta do anything else
to it... have been to a T4 engine to a T1 trans
party... thats not a prob... never been invited to a
T1 engine to a T4 trans party... theyd prolly just
invite me as a joke to throw rocks.... &quot;theres that
guy!!!&quot; :)
 If it ever gets used (the T3).. Im not at all worried
about the cab heat, or AC or cruise control .... or
whatever.... just want to get back on the road ASAP...
If its sumthin simple, no prob, fix it and be on my
way... by whatever means is possible... but sumtimes
that just aint a option... know what I mean?
 Well... that about sums it up. Yall prolly think
&quot;oh... hes just an ex VB dude that got one of those
new fangled buses and is about to gut it&quot; but it just
aint true man...
 Rambling mode set to &lt;off&gt;
Happy bussin...
