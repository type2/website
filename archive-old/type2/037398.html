Hi,

&gt; Thanks Sean Bartnik for your thoughts.
&gt; I have manual transmission and off course the engine does not have a
&gt; variation like this. The engine runs very stable and nicely. ...

	Check your voltage regulator. I've seen a twitchy tachometer
as a result of a dodgy VR or failing battery. If the input to the tach
isn't stable the needle won't be either.

 If your VR is OK but the problem still occurs then you could put
an electronic regulator inline to stabilise the feed: a three wire
12V solid state unit would probably do the job.

Cheers,
	W.
