Subject: Brakes squealing

A week after I did my front wheel bearings (febi) the wheel starts the
squeal after about 15 minutes of driving.

The squeal can be made to go away by applying the brakes hard.  Then it
returns.

I took the wheels off on each side to take a look and I spun the rotors
(brembo) to see what was up and I found that each rotor rubs one of the pads
(pagid) for about 30 degrees of rotation making a squeal.  I can't tell if
the rotor is warped or is the hub wasn't rebuild quite right.  The rotors
seemed perfectly flat in the box so I think maybe the races didn't go into
absolutely true.

Any ideas before I go get some measuring tools and start taking things
apart?
