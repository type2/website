Subject: Free Engine in Seattle

Volks,
I need to make space in the garage so everything must go and go fast.  I =
have a 1800 type IV engine that Im giving away.  The engine is basically =
in boxes but everything is there.  All the engine tin, hardware etc.  The =
engine has a single carb and the smog pump assesmbly is long gone.  I =
think the motor is out of a 74.  The valve seats look bad but the heads =
look pretty decent and probably are salvageable or at least good for a =
core.  Heat exchangers are in great shape. =20

Please let me know if your interested and we can set up a time to meet up. =
 I also still have my 78 Westfalia project bus for sale for only $500 =
bucks!!!  Excellent body.  No serious rust.  Motor has had recent service =
but is currently not running.  Hate to sell but need money fast!  Please =
pass the word.  several have shown interest but nobody has passed over the =
green so its up for grabs.  Dont miss out!

Thanks,
Chad

78 Champange Edition
78 Westy Deluxe (for sale $500)
