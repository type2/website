Subject: Re: [T2] Help getting bellhousing needed 

&gt; Some of the VW shops sell an item that's made out of resin for that very
&gt; purpose. I don't know if the size that you're looking for is avaible. It's
&gt; only enough to mount the starter. You still need a stand or bench. You might
&gt; ask around.

Thanks -- I shall. I have an engine stand, and as long as I can mount this
resin starter holder to either the stand or the engine I'll be fine.

I just wasn't expecting this to be such a hassle.
