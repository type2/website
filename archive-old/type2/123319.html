George,

This is the internet!&lt;grin&gt;  Tons of his stuff(mp3's) available all over 
the place.

Nobody dies on the internet, they just fade into bits.

http://www.wolfmanjack_dot_org/audio/

I grew up listening to him when he was in Del Rio, Texas.
He was about the only thing you could get in the &quot;olden&quot; days
before FM radio in the far reaches of West Texas.

Mandatory bus content.  I probably listened to him while driving my 1967
bus thru Mexico in the late 60's....now you know!

Cheers, dave

&gt; IMO the best sound for a bus comes from an AM broadcast, transmitted
&gt; through the dash-mounted speaker in Marvelous Mono.  Is Wolfman Jack still
&gt; on the air?
