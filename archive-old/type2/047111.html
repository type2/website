&gt;Ah, yes, the dreaded &quot;PUNISHMENT COT&quot;.  I removed and stored mine.

You mean the one in the hole in the roof?  I can't get either kid to sleep
anywhere else.  Someday I'm going to put my foot down and tell 'em I get it.
Hey, to massacre Bob Dylan's song, what could be better than to &quot;...sleep
beneath the diamond sky with one hand dangling free...&quot;?
