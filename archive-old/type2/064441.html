Patrick, (and all of you just tuning in :-)

The variety of different ways you can put a VW van together will never
cease to amaze me.  And indeed I stand amazed (or at least bemused) by the
variety of things VW actually did install, both inside and outside

A while back, I had an exchange with a list member who had the same rear
preheat hose setup you have (forget who or on what year bus).  I went out
and did not find the hoses he was talking about.  He did some further
describing and I finally found the unpunched flats in my tin where the
hoses could have gone.  The Bentleys confirms the setup, but only through
chassis #226 2077 584 (and if you have one on a later chassis, I don't
want to know ;-).  I was gratified to see the installed setup on yours,
and finally see what he was talking about.  Both of you have some preheat
tin wrapped around the crossover pipe, and a hose from it to the air
cleaner, but neither he nor you have anything on the other end (???).
Wanna bet one of our non-North American colleagues weighs in with a
dual-carb dual-preheat T4 setup made somewhere else that the other hole
was punched for, but never used in NA?   Either that or there *was*
originally a hose that led back into the engine compartment so the tube
pocked up clean air :-)  Opinions anyone?

The original system for '75-78 consists of 2 manifolds, 2 U-turn pieces, 2
heat exchangers, 1 crossover pipe (with air preheat tin in '75 and early
'76), 1 &quot;Y&quot; junction, 1 straight connector (or CAT in CA in '78), 1
muffler and 1 tail piece for the stunning total of 11 separate pieces of
pipe!

The manifolds, U-turns, and heat exchangers you are stuck with (as far as
I know), but there are aftermarket exhaust systems that replace the last 5
pieces with one assembly.  Two that I know of are the &quot;Monza&quot; exhaust
system (which I have also seen advertised for the trapezoid port models)
and a stock-looking one-piece system.  I also understand (but have never
looked into) that the stock pieces are available from non-VW sources.
There are plusses and minusses to going either way.

Minusses:
For your '75, you will lose the air pre-heat tin with a non-stock system.
Secondly, if you go for the aftermarket system, you will lose the
&quot;factory stock&quot; designation.  I realize this sounds silly today, but
you are bringing down the future curses of some poor restorer (maybe you
when you retire ;-) who wants to go back to box stock in thirty years.
Knowing your bus this strikes me as a distinct possibility. Also, not for
you but for the others listening in (y'all are still there ain't ya?)
if you were in CA, with a '78, I believe you would be stuck with the
stock system, because of the CAT, but elsewhere and/or earlier, you may
choose to stay stock, go for the one-piece that &quot;looks&quot; stock, or go for
the Monza.

Plusses:  The stock pieces cost (as I remember) $50-$400.  The complete
5-piece rear system from VW cost on the order of $450, when I priced it 5
years ago.  Ouch!  The aftermarket systems are $65-100.  What a
difference!

I have no experience with the Monza style, but have had very good luck
with my one-piece.  It was German made, and is the one still on my car.
It is 5 years and 70,000 miles old and has outlasted both the original
engine and the original body.  I have no idea what company made it, but do
remember having the traditional Mexican vs. German choice and choosing the
German. As I remember I bought it at Olympic, and it cost on the order of
$100 vs. $50-60 for the Mexican version.

All this is of course just food for thought and, as always, YMMV.
