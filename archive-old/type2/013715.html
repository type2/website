Jeff,

i really like this idea.  i dont want to splice into any existing wiring &amp;
its also an economical solution.  but i have a few questions...

1) i would assume that this probe is taking the place of your dipstick. if
this is true then could you please elaborate on how it is secured in
place while driving?

2) any special tools or advice on how to straighten the probe w/o
damaging it?

3) anyone know if these are still avail. at radio shack?

Here's an idea i followed and it worked...and its cheeeep.  For $20 or $30 
you get a digital oven temperature thermometer (they used to sell them at 
radio shack) with a probe...the probe is about 10&quot; long and curved and the 
wiring is sheilded for about 3 feet with steel braiding...straighten the 
probe.  Get the kind that at the other end of the probe is a mini plug and 
this plugs into the digital readout...get an mini plug extension wire...male 
on one end and female on the other...run the wire in some plastic tuping 
under the van to the readout on the dash...the whole thing runs on a aa 
battery...the other end goes down the oil level stick tube and is corked 
witha test tube stopper... the one I have also has an adjustable warning 
beeper when it hits a temp. you have preset...they are durable, independant 
of the bus wiring, and cheap...and accurate...
&lt;end of quote&gt;

mahalo in advance!
