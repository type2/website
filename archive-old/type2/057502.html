&gt;Now when I get hold of old boots that
&gt;are in good condition, I save them.

I'll second that.  A month ago I replaced a torn CV boot that had not
lasted more than about 5,000 miles.  It was one that had been previously
replaced, manufacturer and source unknown, but it was not from VW.

What I replaced it with, because I had it on hand, was one of the
original VW boots, previously saved, that had untold mileage on it and
was more than 20 years old.

I'm looking forward to seeing how much longer it will last.
