&gt;Actually, the best antenna is a quarter-wave on 11m, which is a

&gt;15 feet, a bit more than the 13-1/2 feet allowed.  This is why I

I am not too knowledgeable with the theory behind the radio, but I have
tried just about every CB antenna out there and I have to agree with Joe -
the firestick gives you great range.  I think mine was a bit shorter than 6
ft, and was top-loaded.  I have the full length high fiberglass roof, so I
can't really mount anything on top of the bus.  Here is what I have tried,
in order of effectiveness:

Top loaded firestick mounted to the rain gutter.
108&quot; whip mounted to rear bumper
Small center-loaded whip mounted to the rain gutter
Short Mag-mount on cab roof (inside top)
22&quot; through-the-glass window mount on highroof side window

All were tuned with an SWR meter.

I am currently using the glass mount, even though it sucks, because it
looks good.  :)  My priority is to have the CB when I'm traveling with
another vehicle and in this case range is not too much of an issue.   The
firestick on the gutter looked gaudy and I was concerned (maybe without
good reason) about the stress on the gutter.

If I had a Westy, I would use a good mag-mount antenna on the roof inside
the luggage rack.
