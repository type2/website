&gt; Ouch. Sounds like I need something fairly pricey. Maybe I'll just buy a new
&gt; body and transfer my engine/tranny instead. I've found a few in pretty good
&gt; shape for under $500, but then I got thinking that I could probably get the
&gt; tools to fix up mine for less, but it's looking like it might not only cost
&gt; just as much if not more, not to mention being a LOT harder.

&gt;    I've got a Miller Cricket 120V mig welder and one bus...Your plan
takes one bus out...They're makin' more welders but not more
busses... ;-(
