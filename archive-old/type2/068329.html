Subject: Off-road Busses?

Before I bought my '90 Crew I had a Ranger for hiking, climbing and WW =
kayaking.  All these pastimes involve serious &quot;backroad&quot; driving.  It =
always amazed me that when I got to where I wanted to be some guy was =
camped there in a Bus.  There were many times when I would barely make =
it in my Ford only to sit and listen to how well the &quot;Westy&quot; handled the =
trip.

I sold the stupid truck and bought my Crew and a 73 Camper.  I have yet =
to be stuck.

Once, while in Baja, I was miles off the Transpeninsular at some surf =
haven and it started to rain.  This expatriate American came over and =
asked me if my Crew was  a 4X4.  When I said no he said I would never =
get out until the desert had dried and that might be days.  The desert =
had turned to &quot;gumbo&quot;, a slime like mud of incredible ability to stick =
in everything.  Well, somewhat worried, I quickly piled the family into =
&quot;Ute&quot; and started for the road.  We made it.  Sometimes sliding =
sideways, never in complete control, but always making progress. =20

Is that why Ben Pon designed it the way it is?  Didn't it have something =
to do with poorly designed English &quot;lorries&quot; that had the weight =
unevenly distributed over the wheels both loaded and unloaded?
