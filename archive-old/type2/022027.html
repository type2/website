&lt;&lt; Hello Fine List People:

We're all familiar with the spare tire mounted on the front of a bus, but has 
anyone mounted a spare on the back hatch, kind of SUV-style??  I figure you 
could use the same mounting kit as used for the front.  Also, the sheet metal 
may have to be reinforced, and maybe a lift-gate shock absorber-type of thing 
may need to be added to handle the extra weight of the tire.  Has anyone done 
this??

I have a question regarding the front mount....will that harm the bus?  Did 
the Spare ever come mounted up there from Factory?
