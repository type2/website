&gt; I'm kinda a bike racer as well as a vw dude and have done the Mt Washington
&gt; Auto Road bike race several times. The race is easy, its just 7.6 miles with
&gt; only one hill. One problem though it averages a 12.5 percent grade with 18
&gt; percent sections and a 22 percent short kick at the end.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone ever done it in a bus? Id love to try. F'n scary road. How about
&gt; those brakes?

Would that be this Mount Washington:

And if so, then I wonder if anyone has participated in the race in a bus
(any vehicle built before 1970 is eligible).  I imagine an empty 1964-67
delivery van would have little trouble climbing and might even place
decently.  In that sort of event torque and cooling are all-important.  I
see that the list of makes displayed in 2004 includes Volkswagen, so at
least one bug has shown up.

OOK!
