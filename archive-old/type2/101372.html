Subject: fuel and vaccum lines

There are two lines that go to my carb in my 72 bus. I have a solid rubber 
line which is the vaccum line right??! And I also have a braided type of 
line, which I thought was the gas line but after taking a close look im not 
sure. The braided line goes through this small box that is attached to the 
chassis and on the box are a bunch of numbers (im not sure if they were the 
part number but it didnt look like it) and it says &quot;FLOW&quot; with an arrow. 
Then i remember when i was looking and learning about my brakes, that they 
said something about a box like that that controlled the vaccum to the brake 
servo. So is that the valve that they were talking about. I was trying to 
get some pictures with my new camcorder (its really cool) but i didnt have 
enough light and i havent bothered to go back outside. So really the 
question is, which line is for what??? Thanks for your input everyone
