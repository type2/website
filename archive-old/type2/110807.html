Subject: gas smell.....

Hello fellow listee's!
I have a question, and yes I checked the archives (I
did a search, and didn't find anything definitive). I
have a gas smell, and it is there most always. Not so
much when I get down to a gallon or two, but other
than that, always there. My question is this: Is there
a good resource on the type 2 website or any other for
that matter, that shows how to replace all of the fuel
system rubber, including pictures? I understand that
the filler elbow at the top of the filler pipe is a
bear to get to. Has anyone successfully done this? If
so, how?
Thanks in advance,
Matt '78 westy 'blue'
