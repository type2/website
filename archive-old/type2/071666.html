Subject: Cv bolt question
Message-ID: &lt;ee1d2356.24c0c260_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

hi everyone, 
		I have been having trouble keeping the bolts tight on the 
pasenger side of my bus. I keep checking on them to make sure they are tight. 
The last time I checked I found one had snaped off and another one is loose 
and won't tighten. I was wondering what kind of bolts I should replace those 
with. Also I was wondering if I had to rethread the flang that the bolts 
actually bolt on too? or can I just get a different thread bolt?  also I was 
wondering what are tell-tale signs of bad Cv joints. I just bought this bus 
about 1 1/2 yrs ago and I know some of the history of the bus but I don't 
know everything and while I was fixing the  bolts I figured I'd check the CV 
joints. 
Thanks for you help
