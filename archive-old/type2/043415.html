Subject: Buying a bus?

It seems to be the time of the season that many are looking to buy a
new/different Vanagon/bus.  As a public service, The WetWesties would offer
Tobin and Christa's Bus Buyer's Guide for those prospective purchases.  Though
specifically aimed for bay window bus purchases, there is much info there that
is appropriate for any automotive purchase.  To grab yourself a copy, point
