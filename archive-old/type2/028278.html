I was moving some furniture with my roommate and when we pulled into
his parents driveway my bus stalled out and started making really
funny noises.

I let the engine alone for a bet while moving stuff, and when I started it
up again the battery light was on and the engine was idling at about 600
rpms.
It is also making new noises.

After I get the rpms up to 2000+ it sounds/runs better.

Any clues/diagnoses?  Is my alternator shot or something?  The belt looked
fine.
