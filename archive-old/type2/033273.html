Subject: Anyone buying the 70 westy for sale in Belvidere, IL ( Houston,
	Texas)

I just received a call from the guy who is sell this camper and a man from 
Houston Texas called him up and told him he has a 70' camper already and he 
would buy this other 70 camper. so if you are from Houston Texas and you are 
buying this bus plese get a hold of me. so i can meet up with you when you 
are here picking it up. If you are on this list i am glad you are getting 
this camper and you won't be disappointed in it. Plus i know it is going to a 
good home.
Thanks
