&lt;&lt; I saw this bus on the way home from work... pretty cool!  Has a F*rd
engine in it.  Check out the Cadillac seats.  Nice skylights!  Wonder
what that bumper is from?
 &gt;&gt;

The front bumperettes look like 63'ish rear Vette...The rear bumper
looks like a 55/56 Chevy front bumper...
The grill on the engine lid looks like an MGB... ?-)
All together I'd like to see it appraised on Antiques Road Show...
&quot;What we've got here is a unique example of American automobilia
folk art and if I had it in my auction, I'd guess it would fetch any-
where from a hundred bucks to twenty thousand...&quot;
