&gt;Tim,
&gt;
&gt;I think if you pull the oil pump cover plate off and then have someone move
&gt;the flywheel while you watch, you may be able to detect play in the
&gt;camshaft. Absent of that, I would say you're probably stuck. I don't recall
&gt;if you can see the rivets once you remove the oil pump.
&gt;

ah-hah! sez i, spying the partially disassembled 914 motor sitting on my 
floor...peering into the the hole formerly home to oil pump, while spinning 
the flywheel, you can, indeed, see the rivets

hope this helps
