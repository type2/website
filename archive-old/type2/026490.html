&gt;Re the suggestion to glue magnetic stripping to the front doors;

You misunderstand.  The idea is to glue the magnetic strips to the netting,
not the doors.  Since the doors are metal, the magnetic strips (with the
netting attached) stick to them.  That way when you're not using the
screens, you don't have any kind of fastener left on the doors.
