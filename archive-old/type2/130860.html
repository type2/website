Subject: frozeen rear end??

greetings,
after tuning up the 77 rusty bus to drive this Fall/Winter i couldnt back it 
up! i moved it forward in the driveway about a bus length, but i couldnt 
reverse!? i tried to rock it a little bit, but when i tried to reverse the 
whole bus would torque, but it wouldnt budge. i know its not the tranny, as 
i drove it about 5000 miles last fall/winter before i parked it.

could the E-brake or rear drums be so froze up that they would allow the bus 
to nudge forward, but not in reverse?

THANKS in advance!
