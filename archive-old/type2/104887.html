Subject: RE: [T2] Can I borrow a backyard in Bellingham, WA?

&lt;snip&gt;What would be really cool is if we could all
pool our money together
and
purchase this in the name of Type2.  What better
donation to the list
than a
whole bunch of VW's.  We could keep the Bus stuff and
sell the rest.  I
would be willing to pitch in for something like this. 

&lt;snip&gt;

I got $100 I can chip in!  I need some parts for my 85
Vanagon, 68 and 71 Westies too.
