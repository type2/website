&gt; The BA6 would be your best option.  The archives and library at
&gt; www.type2_dot_com has an article on installing a BA6. 

I have a BA-6 attached to the underside of my 78. I've been thinking
about taking it out and selling it.

The PO told me it didn't work. But i've been told by many people that
it's repairable. make an offer.

Peace
Keith
