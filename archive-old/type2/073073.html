&gt;I have just discovered that most places simply don't have an adapter to do
&gt;anything for my wide-5 bolt stock rims on the '69.

Nobody can work with wide fives here either. JC Whitney has a bubble
balancer for something like $269, and Hoover has an article on bubble
balancing I'd be happy to re-run. That is a lot of money, but maybe if you
have ten or fifeen wide fives to look after it is justifiable...
