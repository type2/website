Subject: RE: [T2] 1973 Bus - how to tell which carb is installed?

Thanks I just ordered the weber rebuild manual to help w/ my carb.  This
will come in handy and will help identify my carb + the leaky component(s).

I also ordered another Bentley, since my original one seems to have gone
missing in the last year or two.

Best regards,
Shawn


&gt;the Haynes Weber rebuild manual which has pictures to identify yours.  If
