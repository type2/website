Subject: Re: [T2] Runs fine until it warms up

Hi Michael,

The low gas milage, black smoke and poor running when warm all point  
to an over-rich condition.

First off, check the fuel pressure, and make sure the fuel return  
line is not kinked. If the fuel pressure is above 35PSI at idle you  
have a bad regulator.

Secondly, bypass the cold start valve with a short section of tubing,  
as it might be stuck open.

Thirdly, verify the wiring between the head temp sensor and the ECU.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; After
&gt; that happens I cant start it again until the engine cools  
&gt; sufficiently for
&gt; it to start again. Now its not getting hot. I can pretty much place  
&gt; my hand
&gt; anywhere on the engine and its not hot. The dipstick feels like the  
&gt; engine
&gt; temp is somewhere in the mid 100's range for temp.
