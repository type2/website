Subject: Re: [T2] heater knob question

Cover your fresh air intake. On my 83 Westy I remove the grill and tape
over the fresh air vent. Works good.

&gt; i'm closing in on finishing my heat setup.
&gt; 1. Good heater boxes.
&gt; 2. Flaps locked open.
&gt; 3. Insulated the duct pipe to the front of the bus 
&gt; 4. Set of  circa '71 bus heater blowers hooked up.
&gt; 5. Doghouse holes blocked
&gt; 6. Plugged the vents under the &quot;way-back&quot; seat
&gt; 
&gt; Heat temp good, but the air velocity at defrosthers is
&gt; meager. (Part of it is that Those VW blowers aren't
&gt; exactly tornados.)
&gt; 
&gt; I'm trying to figure out how the narrow vent under the
&gt; walk-through between the front seats works. I have a
&gt; knob under the driver's right leg that has something
&gt; to do with it. Is out ON and in OFF? Of course, it may
&gt; be disconnected--where does that cable go? I can't
&gt; find it under the bus. The terminus of the ducts is
&gt; covered with a vinyl/asbestos boot that I'm afraid to
&gt; move without an EPA permit.
