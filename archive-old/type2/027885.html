Subject: WA '79 bus being dumped in Chicagoland
Date: Mon, 23 Jul 2001 14:54:22 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I just got a call from a friend in Chicagoland about a couple who are
traveling through from/back to Washington state in a '79 bus.  Seems they
pulled into the lot next to his shop and he went out to see what was up
(he's a VW fanatic also!).  Their story is they ran out of money and need to
sell the bus to fly home.  He described the bus as about as rust free as you
can find, white over a faded orange, and a broken windshield.  It ran very
well and they wanted $1500 for it.  The catch is the title is back in WA.
So, he offered them $1000, but only if the title was FedEx'd before he gave
them the money.  They asked if they could park the bus in his lot and sleep
in it for the night, which he agreed to.  Anyway, no agreement has been made
at this point, so we'll see what happens.  She did produce the registration
for the bus in her name.

The bus is missing the middle seat and is back in WA, but they said they'd
work something out to ship it back.

Has anyone else run into this pair?  Her name is Michelle, but I didn't get
the guy's name.  It seems like a strange story.

Brad
