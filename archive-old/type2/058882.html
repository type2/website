&gt;For you T4 engine folks, it is very important that the muffler be

&gt;check these occasionally (like now, before it gets too cold) because if
&gt;they break, the copper rings under the exhaust manifold are not going to
&gt;stay sealed too long, and worse you will eventually distort the whole
&gt;exhaust manifold.

I've never had those supports connected - driven without anything other
than the 8 studs holding up the exhaust system for 11 years.  I'm not
saying it's the right thing to do, but saying that your exhaust will not
seal may be a bit extreme.  Next time I'm under there I'll look and try to
see where the supports are supposed to be.  It is an awfully lot of weight
for those little studs.  My apologies to the friendly list admin.  :-)
