Subject: Time Capsule Spare Parts Kit

I inherited yesterday a spare parts kit that looks like it was
assembled in 1977. A co-worker, John, had a '74 Westy and his
friend Hank, who travelled to Baja California years ago gave John
the kit, stored in a small metal box. John said the kit contained
'fuel injector stuff.' Since his '74 was not fuel injected, John
never used the kit, and may never have opened the box.

When I opened it I couldn't believe what I found. Stuff I was
meaning to get was there: double relay, gas cap, etc. Even an air
intake sensor.

I knew the air intake sensor is specific to a particular year, so
was prepared for disappointment, but when I checked Bentley, the
part number matches the requirement for a '77 Van, which mine is.
Hey, what luck!?

The kit contains:

Cold Start Valve        022 906 171 B
Double Relay            022 906 059
EGR Adjustable Linkage
Engine Hatch Latch      211 827 503 J/L
Fan Belt                021 903 137 A
Fuel Injector           023 906 051
Fuel Line               5.5 feet
Fuel Line Clamp         20 mm.
Fuel Line Clamps (6)    13 mm.
Gas Cap                 211 201 551 L
Intake Air Sensor       022 906 301 D

There's only one receipt in the kit; it's for the latch and fan
belt and is dated 07 Nov 1977.

I wonder about the age of this stuff and whether some parts have
been superseded by improved versions. The spare double relay has a
shiny metal cover instead of the black plastic on the one running
my engine now. The spare double relay has a bosch part number of
0 332 514 104. The one in my van is 0 332 514 120.

The cold start valve has some corrosion on the injector.

Still, who am I to look a gift horse in the mouth?

'77 marinogelb ( school bus yellow ) Westy.
