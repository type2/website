Subject: Type4 Thermostat update

Hey gang,

Thanks for all the pointers on a thermostat for our '78 bus.  At the 
suggestion of The Bus Depot, I went down to the local VW dealer.  After 
a few phone calls, the parts guy confirmed that he could order part 
021-119-159-A for $58.94.  From what I've seen, this would appear to be 
the real thing, not a type I hack.  I'll let you know if it actually 
comes in.  Either he talked with an optimist, it's no longer NLA, or 
VWUSA found a stash.  Here's hoping for options 2 or 3!

I'm still trying to track down the bracket, pulley, and hardware.  I 
work in a bike shop, so I think I can get by (or maybe improve things) 
with the cabling.  I have an email in to thebusco; otherwise, I may 
need to enlist some help as there ain't many busses around here.  If I 
only had space, there's a great intact '77 w/ blown engine down street 
I'd love to strip down for parts.  Oh well, someday!

thanks again,
joe and rachel broach
