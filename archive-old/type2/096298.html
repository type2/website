&gt; in the San Fernando Valley I found the only foreign car parts store bought a
&gt; bug cable and drove it home as a hand throttle.

yeah reminds me back (way back) when I had a buggy I broke the cable and I
had a friend aboard so he rode back there and operated the throttle via
&quot;voice actuated remote control&quot;  faster faster ,stop
