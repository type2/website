&gt;Hello all, just a quick question, I was wondering if
&gt;anyone on the list has bought or used the solar
panels
&gt;being sold on that auction site we can't mention. 

I bought one but haven't had a chance to try it yet,
as I still need to install the 12V socket in the
bus... I will give a report when it's in... as for the
propane heater, I use a Coleman BlackCat secured
between the front seats...
