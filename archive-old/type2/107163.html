Subject: Re: [T2] avp longblock..am I nuts?

This engine looks like a very poorly painted, low quality plastic 
model!!!!!!!
Look at the pushrods, painted at the same time the engine 
was!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Men, men, men, is that a rebuilt engine, am afraid!
Sorry, thats how i feel.
Yes, you are missing some bolts!

Folks,

look at pic #1 here    http://www.shockwaverider_dot_com/avp/

and tell me that t4's really aren't supposed to have bolts along the
top of the case half's....???


Remember, it's been about 20 yrs since I last did a t4 engine and I 
haven't pulled mine out of the 78 yet...and the fi plenum is sitting over
this part on mine.

Am I really missing about 6 case bolts???


bewildered, dave&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
