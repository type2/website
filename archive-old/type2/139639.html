Subject: 10-14 degrees this morning

I need to brag a little here since my 78 Champagne is making the 
transition from &quot;show&quot; bus to semi daily driver.

Moved it out of the garage last night and let it sit over night outside in 
10-14 degree temps.

Went out this morning and fired right up.  Let it idle for awhile and then 
off to the bumper car races on the interstate ...took a little longer to 
get comfy heat inside, but was nice after about 5 miles.

The only problem occured as I was pulling out of the driveway...radio 
turned itself off cause of low voltage to headlights...very dim...reved 
engine up down the driveway and the VR musta finally kicked back 
in...looks like I might need to replace the alternator sometime in the 
near future.

Cheers, dave
