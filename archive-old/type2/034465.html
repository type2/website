Subject: oil pressure switch

i decided to do some holiday upgradeing on my bus. was going to install
my new oil pressure/temp guages, not that i need them in this weather.
just another thing to get out of the way befor summer. Anyway, the new
VDO sender dosent fit in the hole in the cooling tin that the old one
came out. It is significantly bigger then the other sender. Will i have
to cut the tin? Did i get the wrong sender? or am i missing something,
the bottom part of the sender is a little (not much) bigger then the
top, was it designed this way to be more air tight? or what is going
wrong here? the thread's look the same, except the new one is a bit
longer.
