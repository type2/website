Subject: Re: Brake vacuum hose question

The little doodad David Greenland is refering to and that is screwed
into the engine case is a temperature switch for the vacuum-operated EGR
valve found in '75 and early '76 models. Thus vacuum only goes to the
EGR valve when the engine is warm. It is not clear to me, though, why
the vacuum source is tapped on that side of the firewall.  

Neither does this answer Ed Woenker's original question, whose '74
shouldn't have an EGR valve, AFAIK.
