Subject: Re: [T2] Endplay update (when is it rebuild time?)

Painter has the kits and  Painter should even be able to tell you how to=20=

set it up for your altitude. Inspect the carb closely on cleaning to see=20=

if any of the fittings are coming loose.  BTW counterman, a trade mag=20

things on my bus i will be sending him this fall for some machining.  he=20=

does all my machining for me.  type 1, type 2, type 4.  The kit comes=20
with parts for about 5 different carbs so look at the old parts closely=20=

when putting the new gaskets in.  some of the little holes move around.
