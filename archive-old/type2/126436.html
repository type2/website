Subject: Engine Swap Info?

Anybody besides RoadCow have a Toyota engine in their bus? 

I've got the KEP catalog for the adapters and such, but need to get
specs for the modification of the crossmember, if anyone has them...

RoadCow had cut the center of the crossmember out and welded in a U
shaped part to mount the engine.

I've got a free 20R and all accessories from an old Celica. The engine
is fresh (less than 50k) and I can pull out whatever I need from the
donor car. I'll take for sure: Engine, manifolds, exhaust, radiator,
electronics (coil, etc).

Having a donor car, I'm thinking about cutting the mounts from the
Celica's frame instead, but I'd like any info and experience others
have...

Looks like my high school welding classes will finally come in handy. ;-)
