well, sorta. my 79 2 liter has a metal gasket in between the cyls &amp; the
head. When i pulled it off for a problem valve i noticed &amp; replaced
these parts. pulling it off would influence the Compression &amp; i didn't
want to do that.

&gt; &gt;I will be replacing the head gaskets. &gt; 

Why are you replacing the gaskets? i really can't see these metal
washers going bad, at least not with something much more important
breaking as well. perhaps we might want to revisit why. (:
