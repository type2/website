The Yoko's are back, the Yoko's are back!!

I put them on my 84 westy last spring and they ain't too bad. They are a
solid tire with a moderately agressive tread. As a result they are a little
noisy at highway speed but not too bad. They are 8ply rated VERY important
for westy owners, and are nicely priced. My last tires were 8ply rated
Bridgstones and were much quieter but were strictly a highway tread. My
wife and I like to travel the back roads of the national forests so the
Yoko's have the edge.

&gt; Yokohama has done another production run of the famed Y370 tires. Any
&gt; Yokohama dealer should be able to order them, TireRack
&gt; (http://www.tirerack_dot_com) says they have them as well. Ask for Y370 size
&gt; LT195-75-14, load range D. You may have to give the dealer the Yoko part
&gt; number which is 37047.
