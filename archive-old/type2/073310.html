if things don't work out, i can recommend a really good VW mechanic in
albuquerque. last fall, i drove to AZ with a friend in his recently, ahem,
&quot;restored&quot; '73 superbeetle. the week before we left, we replaced the
convertible top, installed the entire interior, replaced the windshield,
popped in a new tape deck and speakers, and put on all the trim. not once
during that time did he start up the engine. so anyway, the car did ok
until we got to Moriarty, NM, about 40 miles east of Albuquerque. then all
hell broke loose, and i had to pull into a place called blake's lotaburger.
flourescent lights all the way, and the smell of charred flesh everywhere.
yeech.

seems that something got lodged in the fan shroud, dragged the fan to a
complete halt [accounting for the eerie silence before the dashboard lit up
all pretty-like], and caused the engine to overheat nearly to the point of
a complete meltdown. fortunately, we were able to get it towed to
Albuquerque to a place called Anton's Auto Haus  [1041 Central NE is the
address]. it was a mess. spark plug wires were basically gone, and what was
left of the plugs was melted into the block. the valves were shot. the
massive vibration before the eerie silence caused the alternator to rattle
so much the cast iron pedestal that hold it in place was broken in two. the
connections to the muffler were completely shot, and they noticed that the
muffler was pretty much gone. all told, it was about $1000 worth of work,
but that baby drove like never before when Tino was done with it. they said
another couple of minutes and severe damage to the block may have happened,
but we saved it in time.

the moral: never let your sculptor friends tell you that the car is &quot;almost
done&quot; before a huge road trip. the custom fenders sure looked good, but he
never had the engine thoroughly checked out. it ran, so he assumed it was
ok.

anyway, i was very happy with Anton's - they took the car in with no
appointment, worked on it all day, and made it infinitely happier than it
was when we left Cape Cod. we were in Arizona on time, despite the beetle's
near-death experience. i'm planning on stopping by to say hi in my new bus
later this month. they saved our butts.
