Subject: Re: [T2] ball joint thread size?

&gt; I cannot find a tool place near me to help measure the thread size
&gt; using the nut, But I'm guessing it's somewhere around 17mm 1.5 pitch?
&gt; Please if anyone knows, or can direct me to a resource, It would be
&gt; much appreciated, so I can try to locate a die to clean up the threads

When I needed a tap for my thrashed CV I took a CV bolt which I was not
certain of the size/pitch of to the tool supply
Dewitt Tool Co here in Miami. He went in the back
and found a tap to match.
Pretty sad that a tool supply wouldnt go to that minimal effort for a
customer.
