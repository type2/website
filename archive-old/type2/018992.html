&gt; I do say that up front when dealing with folks, nothing worse than trying to
&gt; sell a car, agree on a price, then you don't hear from him again.  In the
&gt; mean time you've told three or four callers it's already sold.
&gt; First come first served is the best policy with used cars.

Yeah, sure, but, having said that, how do you deal long distance with
the guy that says you have a deal? 
I've done two different things:
1. If you're sure that you really want this thing sight unseen, wire
transfer him the money.(Get his checking account number and your bank
can handle it- it'll be there in a couple of hours.) I did this back in
the 80's when I was the first one to call out of Hemmings ad for a 58
Porsche Speedster for $1700. When I'd driven the 1000 miles pulling the
trailer, I was a LOT dismayed! I couldn't BELIEVE cars could rust like
that. I took it home anyway, it was still worth more than THAT! (But
watch out! I think it's human nature to visualise a perfect car with the
flaws added on rather than to visualize a HORRIBLE  car with a few
redeeming features!)
2. Get there in a hurry! Back in 1986, I'd been trying to buy  the 69
double cab for about 2 years- either it wasn't for sale or I was broke.
When the owner called me at 9AM and offered it to me for $700, I'd
collected my tow vehicle, towbar, all the tools, the cash, my wife (her
support is ALWAYS KEY, and not always forthcoming) and  driven some 200
miles to his front door by 8PM!
Seems to me the guy should hold it a short time while you drive, or
inform you that you have NO deal till money is in his hand! (Even the
Porsche guy held off for a few hours till the money got there!)
