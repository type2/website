&gt; We are assembling the engine for china Cat, my son's 75 Westy. We are nearly 
&gt; at the point of getting the heads on, and I'm worried about the tin. When we 
&gt; disassembled this 1.8L T-4, we had to wiggle and force the cylinder tin off 
&gt; as the heads came off. I don't look forward to doing the reverse of that 
&gt; process, as it was not at all &quot;procedural&quot;., but rather like random force.
&gt; 
&gt; I've looked through all my books, and there is no detailed procedure for 
&gt; this, so I'm thinking somehow I did it wrong in taking this tin off.
&gt; 
&gt; Will someone who has done this please tell me the sequence and the method ro 
&gt; re-installing this tin?
&gt; 

there seems to be two ways to get the heads on past the upper tin


1.  the official and D method, take everything off the top of the engine
and remove the upper tin.  this is how VW and the manuals all say to do
it, it adds at least an hour (usually more) to a head removal.

2.  cheat,  in this case you bend the corner of the tin that blocks the
head (pulley end) flat remove the scews that hold the upper tin and just
lift it enough to get the head on and off.

have done it both ways, have never had any trouble gettin the tin bent
back to shape (work carefully) or getting the head bolts torqued.

it is real tight on the gen/alt side (cyl 1/2)

pays yer money takes yer choice
