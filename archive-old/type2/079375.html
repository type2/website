&gt; Yes- before this incident I was under the impression that living bodies
&gt; would make for rather elastic collisions,

The last thing that you want is an elastic collision!  If something
bounces off the front of the bus it will impart even more momentum change
to the bus and you.

but noooo. Apparently deer also
&gt; routinely total cars, though they must weigh hundreds of pounds less than
&gt; cows on average.

Accelerating any multi-hundred pound object from 0 to the speed you are
going in a few inches will cause incredible forces.

&gt; And I've heard that those unfortunate enough to hit a
&gt; moose really have a hard time, partly because moose are so tall and
&gt; they tend to come in through the windshield even on big tall trucks. Owie.

Something I pondered seriously as I drove along Canadian roads with forest
growing right up to the edge of the road.  On a motorcycle.  Someone told
me that moose can even run through thick woods despite their racks.

&gt; BTW, the cow in question was a juvenile, maybe 1 year old.

A few miles north of the place where I hit the deer we had met (the year
before) a fellow in a pickup that had hit a yearling steer with his F-350
F*rd truck with a very hefty full-width grillguard,  The impact had bent
the frame and shoved the grillguard into the grill, as well as wiping out
the radiator.  Coolent, transmission fluid, and diesel fuel were all
running onto the ground.

Be careful out there!
