&gt;However now it seems that when I depress the gas pedal it revs up

&gt;What could be wrong?

I had a similar problem with my '73 recently although the revs did not drop
off again.
The cure was a squirt of WD40 lub oil on the hindge at the base of the
accelerator pedal.

To qoute others &quot;grease is a buses best friend&quot;
