Subject: '72 Safare For Trade or Sale

Well, the day has come.  I hate this and is why I would prefer to trade 
it rather than sell it.

I would like to trade my '72 Safare Custom Camper for a '71 Poptop Camper 
of some sorts.  My '72 features:

The Good
~~~~~~~~
 o 1977 2000cc F.I. engine, 15,000 miles on complete rebuild
 o Hard Top Safare Conversion all there and in excellent condition
 o 5000 miles on new tires (with paperwork) (Goodyear Wrangler GSAs)
 o Cargo floor sections are solid

The Bad
~~~~~~~
 o Needs a tune-up and valve adjust
 o Needs some body work and paint though minimal.  Rust hole has formed 
   on passenger side on the bottom just in front of rear wheel.  Rest is 
   just surface rust and one small dent in the back.
 o Rear bumper dented (from previous owner)
 o Transaxle is starting to show some signs of wear.  Shifting is not 
   what it use to be and shift coupler is new.  Bad syncros likely.
 o Needs wheel bearings in front, some grinding is noticeable but only at 
   highway speeds through the curves.
 o Fuel tank is leaking when completely full, possible hole in filler 
   tube.  Can't tell without pulling the engine.
 o Calipers needed for front, bleeders are frozen.  Brakes fine though as 
   long as you pump it once.
 
All-in-all, it is a very nice and clean Bus.  Rare Camper in great 
condition on top of it.  

What I want
~~~~~~~~~~~
I would really like to trade this for a Poptop Camper of some sorts.  
pre-72 is preferred as I want an upright fan chassis.  Must be a poptop 
camper, I am really growing tired of hardtop campers at my height.  I am 
looking for a solid bus without an engine as I have a new one on the 
bench ready to go.  1971 is the ideal year, the Bus I am trying to find 
will be prepped for Inuvik next year and is my primary need for a Poptop.

Replying via email is the best way to get in touch with me.
