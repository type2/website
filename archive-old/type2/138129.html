Subject: Fwd: VERY IMPORTANT: Bentley Publishers donates 100% of web
  revenue to tsunami relief through Jan 10!!!

Forwarded from the Vanagon List. If you were thinking of buying a
Bentley manual in the near future then here's a good reason to spend
your $$$ sooner rather than later:
____ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ __ _

VERY IMPORTANT!!!

Buy those Bentley service manuals and CD's before midnight Monday,
January 10, 2005.

I just saw this on  www.bentleypublishers_dot_com:

Tsunami Relief Effort
&quot;In solidarity with those affected by the tsunamis in South Asia,
BentleyPublishers_dot_com will be transferring 100% of its retail web
revenue (revenue rather than earnings) collected from Midnight December
31, 2004 through Midnight January 10, 2005, to the U.S. branch of
Doctors Without Borders/Midecins Sans Frontihres (MSF)
&lt;http://www.doctorswithoutborders_dot_org&gt;. Funds will be earmarked for
victims of the tsunami. We have chosen this organization because of
their quick mobilization and their effectiveness in delivering a high
percentage of funds received as direct care.&quot;
