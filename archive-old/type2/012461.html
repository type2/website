Hi Craig,

I think you're right about the York requiring lots of
horsepower (6HP vrs 1.5HP for Sanyo).  When my York AC
was working last year we were at the outer banks in
blazing heat.  The AC worked great, and never seemed
to affect the engine oil temperature much, but boy did
it affect the gas mileage.  I think mileage dropped
from 19 to more like 15 mpg.  After working all this
time to get it fixed, I was a little dissapointed.

I've been told my aftermarket system was made by a
company called DPD.  I never could locate them, so I'm
sure they must be out of business.  At one time,
however, I heard they were in Texas.  I have 2 pages
of the installation schematic for this system. 
Unfortunately the diagrams have no parts list, so you
can't tell who made parts like the evap motors, cond
motors, or even the 4 1/2 inch pulley on the clutch
assembly of the compressor.

Check your pulley diameter on your York.  If it's 4.5
inches, I'll bet your system is the same as mine.  On
my 80 Westy, the pulley has to be small (and
non-standard) to clear the bus frame.  It only clears
by a little over an eighth of an inch, so I always
marveled that it worked at all given all the road
vibrations and motions.

Rob
