Subject: [T2] Wipers and headlight woes


&gt; Hello listees, can't wait to see you all at Everybus!  Prudence just
&gt; came home from the body shop and looks very shiny and happy; they really
&gt; did a great job.  But now there are two problems stumping us:  the
&gt; wipers do not turn on even tho we can hear the motor running,
Shine a flashlight up under dash to see the connecting rods coming from the
motor, you should see a rotating arm at the motor and it may have been
disconnected from the arms that run the wipers.
 they
&gt; worked prior to going into the shop but it will be a pain to drag her
&gt; back there if we can fix it ourselves.  Also, I have no low beams
Probably a fuse&gt;

.  High
&gt; beams work fine-where do we start to look to fix this?   Thanks in
&gt; advance for your advice!  LOVE, Beth and Prudence the newly painted 78
&gt; bus.
