&gt;Actually both are for the A/C.  I don't know what they are called, but
&gt;that's what they are for.  Never been much for knowing my A/C


Sean is quite correct, the late VWoA dealer install (COOL system) include
two, lets see must be condensors underneath the van, one immediately forward
the front axle beam, the other having dual electric fans mounted amidship
between the frame rails.  The much superior DPD installation (much nicer
interior unit with dual fans) had only a single under the mid section again
with dual fans.  On the '77 I've been thinking recently about a compressor
upgrade to a rotary Sanyo I have laying around, as it is needing new hoses
all round, and a change to 134A at the same time.  I'd like to ditch the
front condensor as it is quite prone to damage and blocks adjustment of the
hand brake.  But I'm leery with regards to already losing capacity from the
134A.  Any opinions out there.  FWIW the DPD is a much nicer install with a
louvered steel gaurd over the condensor and the improved interior bits.  The
COOL system compressor adjustment is superior though.  Neither are really
worth a damn in real terms, but one must try.
