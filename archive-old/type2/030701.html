A few years ago, I had an exhaust manifold stud pull out of the 1.8 914 motor
that I bought from a volume rebuilder located in Californa that frequently
advertises in the T&amp;A rags.

Anyway, shortly after first startup, an exhaust leak developed due to an
exhaust manifold stud pulling out of the head. (The oppisite head to the one
that had an exhaust valve break 30,000 miles into the motor's life, splashing
pieces of piston all over everywhere.)

I repaired it using a case saver.  I dont recall what size though.  I took the
stud to Dune Buggy Supply Company in Hopkins, Minnesota, and the machinist
sold me a new stud, and a case saver with internal threads to accept the stud
and external threads a bit bigger than those of the stud.

Laying under the car, I drilled and tapped the stripped hole and installed
the case saver with high strength Loctite.  The tricky part is drilling the
hole straight.  In my case, I was able to get it straight enough for the
stainless steel heat exchangers my 914 has as they are held on just by some
loops that are welded to the pipes.  Bus heat exchangers however, (at least on
my '78) have a fairly long hole through the cast iron (I think its cast iron?)
that each stud fits through quite precisley.  When I rebuilt my '78's 2.0 last
winter, I remember it being difficult to get the manifolds on and off due to
the fit of the studs to the manifolds.  So I suspect there is little room for
error in straightness with the Bus manifolds.

One idea I had, but have not needed to try yet, was to get a spare manifold,
and drill the hole corresponding to the stud you are repairing for size you
need to drill into the head, on a drill press.  Then mount the manifold using
the other threestuds, and use it as a fixture to keep the drill straight as
you go into the head.
