Folks,

I have a friend (internet deprived) who is taking a two week trip through
Southern California.  He will be travelling from Bakersfield to San Diego
during this trip and would like to find out what places to hit as far as
parts for his 79 Westy.  Please pmail me this info since he does not have
email yet.

Thanks

Ed Woenker
74 Westy
