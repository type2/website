Subject: RE: [T2] '79 Door on '74 Bus?

No ...

The hinges changed in 76 - everything else is the same. You need to
find a pre-76 door for your 74. But you can use all the internals - the
glas will fit.

Subject: '79 Door on '74 Bus?
Message-Id: &lt;20040301213628.7A5431C17D_at_mail.neale_dot_org&gt;

I know that this has been covered in the past, but for some reason I
can't 
find the messages when I checked the archives.

I had some delightful child smash in the passenger window of my '74
last 
night to rifle the glovebox, given that the parking area of the Units I

live in is open to the public (how the little &amp;^%*&amp;% gotto it last
night), 
I can't afford to leave it open like that.

The quickest way to fix it, IF it would work, would be to go to the
garage 
where I've got my bits n pieces and swap the passenger door for the 
passenger door off '79 DC I stripped a while back. Problem is, I seem
to 
remember the hinges etc changed sometime between '74 and '79, in which

case I couldn't swap the doors over.

Can anyone give a catagorical answer on whether I can just bolt the '79

door into the '74?

Thanking you in anticipation.
