Subject: Re: [T2] Birth Certificates

&gt; Has anyone seen the new style birth certificates? It looks like they
&gt; are a little more useful now with some M-codes listed but their
&gt; records still seem to be incomplete.


Didn't someone recently post on the Samba about providing the wrong M-code
to them and getting an inaccurate birth certificate?

To me, if I have to provide the info, it's a little silly and pointless. I
want them to tell ME something.

&quot;Yes, Doctor, I know my new baby is blond and blue, but please put brown
hair and eyes down on the birth certificate.&quot;

It just doesn't seem right.
