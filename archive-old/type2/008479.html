. Tell me how you did your alternator conversion. I
&gt; don't think a generator is going to cut it. I want to be able to run
a good
&gt; set of fog lights.

Well this question was asked personally, but I have seen the question
asked before on the list so I will post it here for the good of all (I
hope)

This is for 71 and earlier Busses, at least back to 68, if not earlier.

 The best place to start is with an Alternator convertion kit,
intended for a Bug, but works great on a bus. 
  I used a Bosch Alt with the internal regulator. 
Pull the motor and remove the old Gen. and related tin and gen stand.
Remove the regulator from the engine compatment.
Remove the fuel pump and push rod.
Replace with Alternator type push rod and fuel pump ( they are shorter)
Install Alternator with its tin and Alternator stand.
Use the fan that you were using previously.
Install the motor
On top of the Alt. there will be 2 terminals.
1 large and 1 small.
Find the large Red wire that went from the starter to the regulator.
Extend or replace as nessesary to make this wire reach to the large
terminal on the Alt.
The small blue wire that was on the regulator that ran to the dash
light will now go to the small terminal on the Alt. 
That is it. It is very simple.
Some notes, the fuel pump must be changed, the Gen fuel pump is to
tall and will hit on the Alt, you must change the push rod at the same
time, they are different.
Be sure the tin you have for the Alt. is ment for the one you have.
The easiest way to do this is to pull it as a unit off a Bug, or to
get a kit with all the parts in it. I am told that there is different
tin depening on the Alt.
Also after start up the Gen light will remain on untill you rev the
engine past 1100rpm the first time. The light will remain out at idle.
This happens at every start up.
I hope this helps some of you out. It is a very easy and worth the
investment.
Drop me a note if I need to answer any questions about this.
There was an Alternator in use in VW's that was externaly regulated,
but I don't recamend it for the convertion. Too much extra work, extra
wires and its not as clean looking.
