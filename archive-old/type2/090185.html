Subject: Re: [T2] Buster's New Bits

&gt; faces. :) We spent another 1/2 hour struggling to put it back in place.
&gt; It's hanging there precariously, but from outward appearances at least
&gt; you wouldn't really know that the door isn't attached. Unless of course
&gt; a stiff wind comes by and knocks it loose. So this weekend I will be
&gt; spending time with my manuals, and the door, trying to figure out how
&gt; it's supposed to work first and then why it isn't working. Wish me luck.

Sherri read this I believe by our beloved Mr Steve Dolan.
