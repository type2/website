&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; These are the noises &quot;Rattle,humm,grumble,growl&quot; that
&gt; my shift linkage makes at various RPM ranges.  I was
&gt; wondering if any VW sages had such advice on repairing
&gt; this most annoying/maddening racket.  Of all the
&gt; issues this bus has, this one is the only one I can't
&gt; live with much longer :-)

Oyez!  Me too!  I thought the rattling was coming from the dash, but a
keener eared passenger traced it to the stickshift, and sure 'nuff, if I
gently hold it in place, the noise is significantly lessened.

Something loose?
