Recently I saw in an overheating response that someone suggested 
retorwuieing the head bolts. I have had a couple of people tell me to do 
that in the past, just check the torque on the head bolts with the rocker 
arms off. (Thus the 4 bolts you can get too with the engine still in.) Now 
someone else told me once (a VW mechanic) NOT to do that, since you are only 
torqueing the 4 bottom bolts, not the 4 top, hidden by engine shroud and 
only accessable with engine out (I think). I'm talkng about a 1600 dual port 
here (mines a 71 westy). As this makes sense, I'm confused. Those that told 
me to check only those I could check say don't worry about the top bolts. 
Any ideas? Does this unevenly torque the head sufficiently or is it no big 
deal?
