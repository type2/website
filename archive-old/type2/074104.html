Subject: junkyard update

Just got back from pick-a-part in Hayward, CA

2 Vanagon not much left.

1 68 or 69 poptop Westy it was also pick over.
2 75 Westy with what was left of the A/C some left but still pick over.

I see less &amp; less of the buses coming to yards and when they do show up the 
type IV engines &amp; trans go fast.

Chris
