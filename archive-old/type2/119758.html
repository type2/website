Subject: Re: [T2] scratching head after several repairs???

Sounds like you are in the same boat with me, I have a
80 Westy, got all the air leaks stopped on it now it
wont idle right but my AFM needs to be adjusted and I
can't find a co tester to set it with here in SC. Do
not adjust the AFM without a test machine, mine was
fine untill I played with it. Phil
