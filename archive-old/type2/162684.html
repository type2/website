there's a real good photo in chapter 10 fig 6-8 of the Bentley


&gt; adjusting the linkage needs to be done EXACTLY as it
&gt; &gt;is step by step in the Bentley.
&gt;
&gt; if it's not too long and if you still have the Bentley, would you be able to
&gt; tell me the procedure?
&gt; JT

it is Chapter 7, job 13.2 pg's 44&amp;45  figures 13.6 &amp; 13.7

this is a case where the Bentley manual is indespensible, if you don't
have one, beg, borrow or uh, beg you really need the manual for a lot of
settings on the Type 2  no other manual (except the rarer and more
expensive orange shop manual) will do the job.

the 76-79 tranny looks different but this adustment is done the  same
