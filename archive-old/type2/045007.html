Subject: [T2] any VT Listees?

hey volks,
i was just wondering if there are any Vermont listees
out there?   my wife and i will be moving out there in
about a year and i was wondering what the vehicle
inspection process is like out there.  we are still NY
residents but have been living in Nebraska for the
past 2 1/2 years so none of my vehicles have been
inspected in about 3 years.   in fact since ive owned
the bus ive never had it inspected:)   i figure i
better try and find out some info so my perfect
&quot;non-inspected&quot; world is not shattered all at once
when we hit Vermont.   any info is greatly
appreciated.
