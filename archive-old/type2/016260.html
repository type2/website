I'll keep sitting for the few minutes it takes to let the engine
warm a bit, longer in really cold weather. It isn't just a question of
VW vs. Muir -- ask anyone in the trucking and/or heavy equipment
industry. In fact there are aftermarket items sold to deal with the
problems of coldstarting -- electric oil pumps which provide positive
oil pressure to the whole engine before you ever turn it over, for
instance, which are a very good idea. Also engine block heaters, oil
heaters, etc. which not only help get the beast started, but also
definitely add life to to the machine by warming up the metal *before*
any stress is placed on it.
      You really have no idea how brittle steel can be in cold
temperatures unless you've worked daily with logging and/or heavy
equipment in the winter. When it's below zero (F.), massive chunks of
steel break so easily that it makes one wonder if it even pays to go to
work.
     A slower warm up is a plus, it allows a more gradual stressing of
parts. Also don't forget here that we have engines which don't evenly
warm up, expand/contract, etc. at any time -- steel, magesium, and
aluminum all warm up and expand at very different rates.
     I don't respect VW's manuals in the slightest -- I had a brand new
'68 bus which was maintained by the dealer and had to have a valve job
done at less than 25,000 miles. Clearly their ideas on maintenance
scheduling sucked bigtime. And after I starting doing it myself, I
learned to totally ignore VW's nonsense. Warm it up, adjust those valves
every 1000 miles (solid lifters), check the timing and points then too,
and go no longer than 2000 miles between oil changes (non-filtered
engines).
