&gt; I just changed out my tranny and am replacing the fluid.  Does anyone
&gt; know the proper gear oil to use?  GL4 is what Bently's says but does not
&gt; give a weight.  Also what is the difference between GL4 and GL5?

85w90 is probably about all you're going to be able to get these days--new
vehicles use GL5, so that's where the different weights are going to be.
NAPA and Pep Boys will both have Sta-Lube GL4.

The difference between GL4 and GL5? To stay as untechnical as possible, GL5
will corrode the bronze synchronizers in your transmission, and GL4 will
not. FWIW, synthetic GL5 ($$$$$$$$) won't corrode the synchronizers either,
but some people have trouble keeping synthetic GL5 from leaking past the
seals. If you have new seals in the transaxle, you should be okay.
