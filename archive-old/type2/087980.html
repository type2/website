Subject: Re: [T2] Headrests (again)

I have replied on the list to every headrest question.....

Headrests were 1st offered in 1973. They were one-year-only because of the
release button on each post.
74/75 were soft vinyl with a zipper along the bottom from post to post. Age is
getting to them. Almost all have the material between the zipper and the vinyl
deteriorating and splitting.
76 to 79 were hard vinyl. The sun hardens them.....

They all will fit any 73 to 79 bay bus seat. They will not fit Vanagon seats.
I have not seen any original 72 and back seats having the tubes welded in the
seat back frame....

I have almost every color 76 and up headrests in pairs, EXCEPT black. Black is
very tough to find. I have a few pairs of 74/75 headrests also but they are
not in the best shape.....



&gt; I see this every so often come accross this list, but I never see a reply -
&gt; maybe the replies have been private so far?
&gt; My Bently book says that head restraints were optional in '68-'73.  My PO
&gt; didn't get that option, but I'd really like them in front - I'd feel safer
&gt; driving around.  I'll be re-covering the seats anyhow and they all came with
&gt; the mount spots for the headrests.
&gt;
&gt; Does anybody have a set of these for the front?  Or, even one of these?  Any
&gt; color, any year (68-73), any shape?  Or, does anyone have an idea of who
&gt; might sell these?
&gt;
&gt; I have checked with the salvage yards around here and have done an online
&gt; salvage yard part request.  Nothing...
&gt;
&gt; I was even thinking that if I could just know how they were made, maybe I
&gt; could make some - I can weld and sew....
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Jen
