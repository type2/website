Subject: Re: micrometers

I had a project at work one time.  To measure the variations in the 
thickness of a thin sheet of stainless steel, both before and after 
some chemical etching.  I used a micrometer that had divisions at the 
.000 010 mark.  By interpolating between those marks I could read to 
half a millionth of an inch.  What makes this relevant is that I was 
measuring several thicknesses of material and I used my personal 
feeler gage set from my VW toolbox as the standard for double 
checking the mic, &amp; to be able to compensate for temperature changes.  
I had to take frequent breaks to allow the mic to cool off, since my 
hands warmed it up and changed the readings.  ANYWAY
I had my feeler gage set checked by our calibration lab using the 
most sophisticated technique then available, a laser system of some 
sort.  BOTTOM LINE NOW, set rambling mode off

Those feeler gage sets are VERY VERY accurate.  None of the the 
feelers gages was off more than .0002 from the indicated thickness.

&gt; I did check the thing against a few feeler gauges once, and it fell in
&gt; perfectly. That ain't philosophical proof--the caliper and the feeler could
&gt; both be wrong--but it's a hop, skip and a jump toward scientific proof,
&gt; which means that it is likelier than any proposed alternative. ;)
