Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Overheating / to those who use Gene
  Berg dipstick ...

you could try using a smaller upper pulley (Porsche) in summer.    I hear 
that works very well.   I had a smaller upper pulley  (non-porsche) on my 65, and 
it ran too cool in winter, so I took it off and lost  it.  Didn't run hot in 
summer anyway.

We're  having trouble with temp creep in hot weather in our 62 with the
1776  motor. But from all that's said about speed and temp, maybe we
just need to  accept driving slower in hot weather. We had to keep
around 55 mph to keep  temp under 225 last summer.

&gt; ya, I'm surprised that the oil temp is  high when your head temps are within
&gt; a good range.
&gt; I prefer to  keep oil temps 170-210F, and don't want it over  225.
