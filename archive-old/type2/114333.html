Subject: Wheel balancing in CT?

Has anyone been able to find a tire shop in CT to balance old style 5 
lug wheels?  I've been calling around all afternoon, and the closest 
I've gotten is Town fair tire saying their warehouse truck tire place 
can balance any rim with at least three holes, but I'd have to buy my 
tires there. (tires are already bought)  Even the old timer place near 
my house said they hadn't used their adapter in years, and think they 
got rid of it.

I live in the New Haven area

thanks
