Subject: Re; What to fix first.

Fix all the safety items first before you worry about that distributor.

It'll keep your son from taking it out on a joy ride before you work
on the...
-- brakes
-- wipers
-- lights
-- safety belts
-- replace the fuel lines
-- valve cover gaskets
-- you said you'll change the fuel lines, but I just have to repeat,
-- change the fuel lines.
-- change the vacuum hoses
-- change the fuel lines
-- Any corroded wires
-- comprehensive insurance policy.

Then you can replace that screw and let him out of the road.  I only
mention having a comprehensive policy so you can get it repaired
after the un-insured driver down the road decides to use the
restored VW as a skateboard ramp for his SUV.

Oh, and remember to change the fuel lines,
