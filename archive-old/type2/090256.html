Subject: Re: [T2] push tube rod seal replacement

with a type4 engine like yours, this is very easy. you don't have to
remove the head like on the type1 engines. The tubes just pull out the
head :) While at it I would pay the extra $$ &amp; get the viton seals
(they work fantastic) &amp; I would also replace the valve cover seal as
well. the only other piece of advice I would give is to
beg/borrow/steel a torque wrench if you don't aleady have one. the
studs that hold the rocker shafts to the head are pretty small &amp; the
torque rating is low as well (i think like 10ft-lbs). Don't want to
overtighten those guys &amp; strip it out of the head. Make sure you
adjust your valves after doing this as well. It's a very easy
procedure &amp; you should have no problem doing it, as long as you pay
attention. good luck.

&gt; checked out.  I need new push rod tube seals.  The mechanic wanted
&gt; $240 to replace them.  Since they cost about $0.40 each I think I am
&gt; going to attempt this one myself.  This will be the 1st time I do
&gt; any real work on my engine.  I have manuals ready and another person
&gt; to read them to me.  Is there anything else I should look at or
&gt; replace while in there?  Any other seals or gaskets I will need?  I
&gt; know I will need to replace the valve cover gaskets, but what else?
&gt; Any recommendations?  Anything to be emphasized?
