Subject: Re: HEAT:Combustion or Friction?

&gt;&gt;Next time your van runs out of gas at the top of a very steep hill, put 'er in
&gt;&gt;4th and ride down the hill with the engine engaged (being turned by the
&gt;&gt;force of
&gt;&gt;gravity, not internal combustion). Think she'll get hot? I *don't* think so.
&gt;&gt;Might louse up something else, but it won't be from heat.

&gt;I'm confused...this paragraph seems to contradict the one I'm about to
&gt;comment on.


&gt;&gt;Which came first? The chicken or the egg? When you compress anything, air, for
&gt;&gt;example, it gets hot.

Eric, in the first paragraph I mean the heat relative to when the engine is
being driven by combustion, not gravity. Not relative to an engine at rest. And
most of that heat will be created by the compression of the air in the
cylinders, not friction.

Comments on the second paragraph are well founded. Technically, the mechanical
energy used to compress the gas is converted to heat. However, if the heat
cannot be given off, the compressed gas will remain hot. 

The state of refrigerant at the inlet port of a compressor is a low pressure
gas. The compressor compresses the gas into a high pressure high temperature
gas. Because of the increase in pressure, the heat in the gas has been
concentrated and therefore is increased above the ambient air temperature. This
heat in excess of the ambient temperature dissipates via the condenser (the
outside coils in a refrigerant system). The high pressure, high temperature
(hot, lots of stored energy from the COMPRESSION, not friction ;-) ) flows thru
the condenser and is cooled to a high pressure liquid as it gives up its heat.
From the condenser the high pressure liquid flows to the receiver/dryer and then
to the expansion valve where the pressure is reduced and the liquid is allowed
to expand in the evaporator (the inside coils of a refrigerant system). When the
pressure is reduced the refrigerant will sucessfully transform itself from a
high pressure liquid to a low pressure liquid, then to a low pressure gas. As
the low pressure liquid expands and becomes a low pressure gas it absorbs heat.
To satisfy the refrigerant demand for heat, the air passing over the evaporator
gives up heat to the evaporator and in diong so it becomes cool. The low
pressure gas then returns to the inlet port of the compressor where the cycle
repeats itself.
