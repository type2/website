Hi people.  Does anyone have any ideas as to what I can use for the rubber
molding which is on the rear pans between the bumper and the body on a 68-71
bus. No one that I checked with ( all the usual suppliers) have any. One guy
even laughed. If anyone has any ideas, I could sure use one. TIA TBear

Don't take life too seriously- you'll never live through it.
