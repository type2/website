Subject: RE: [T2] '68 master cylinder kaput.... need one bad by thursday
  eve...

&gt; wow... I am getting the bus ready for the maiden family
&gt; camping voyage (Friday morn. depart) to Manassas Va.
&gt; battlefield, then to Manassas bug out... and I discover the
&gt; brake pedal goes, further to the floor than before the winter
&gt; hibernation.
&gt;
&gt; So, wife is flipping, kids are still wanting to see the
&gt; Karmann ghias and herbie.... And it is Tues. night in western PA.
&gt;
&gt; Can the list direct me to a source of a '68 bus master cyl.
&gt; that can be at my door by thurs. afternoon?


No problem. Mark. I can have one at your door on Thursday if you order it
soon. Order it from the following link, choose Red Label shipping, and email
me to let me know how early on Thursday you need it. (About $12 for delivery
by end of day, or $20 for mid-afternoon.)
