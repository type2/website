Your SO apparently doesn't understand the function of a VW cooling system.

The engine draws air from the engine bay (supplied from the vents on the
sides) and drives it with a fan past the cylinders.  The magic is in
getting the air to go exactly where it is needed to cool the hot parts of
the engine.  The tin is what directs the air where it needs to go.

A great amount of engineering time and talent went into the design of the
cooling system.  &quot;mounting a few fans&quot; around the engine bay is unlikely
to be as effective as the stock system.
