Subject: Re: [T2] problems with 68-70 directional switch

&gt; Well,  got my bus back from the shop, and after $570 spent, I came out
with
an inspected bus, with everything working. When it was in the shop, I was
told that the directional switch was only working sometimes. My bus is a 69,
&gt; and that particular switch is NLA.

It's available from DUS DEPOT for $119
