Subject: Re: rotten beam fix?

my beam on my 69-westy also cracked(the night before we were to leave to get 
the hubcap in okeechobee florida)the local vw shop here welded it i havent 
had any problems and everything still looks good but i am checking the local 
salvage yards for another one.40-50 buks for a good used one its cheaper than 
if you got it welded.
