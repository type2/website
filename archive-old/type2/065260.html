Subject: rubber; goodies

Hi all - thanks for the responses to the Goodies post... I'm talking again
to my friend tomorrow.
This all started when I went looking for new window rubber for my 70 Deluxe
Neunsitzer. He had a box of COMPLETE RMMW rubber he'd sell me for $100
(told you he was a good guy!), but it is all *cal look!* I happen to like
the chrome widgets on my bus; he says that A) you can't find replacement
rubber for that and B) when you DO find it, it's more trouble than its
worth. Says if I *really* want to keep the chrome, I should take an Xacto
to it and cut a channel - carefully, of course. Any thoughts?
- -Craig
