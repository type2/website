The new J.C.Whipme catalog, on page 125, lists an air/fuel gauge which
requires an oxygen sensor for a sender. It is a nulticolored bar graph type
gauge showing a rich to lean condition. Being a gauge fanatic, this sounds
great to me (one more thing for my paranoid self to worry about). Anyone
ever used one? Anyone see any benefit aside from tuning the engine? TBear
