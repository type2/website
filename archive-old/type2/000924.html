Dear Listas,

Got a pretty big trouble with my 32-34 pdsit-3 solex's, i turn on my engine
and leave it spining round 10 minutes and it consumes 2 liters of gas!!!
It's insane !!! Every time i acelerate a big black cloud comes out of my
exaust pipe, too much gas is being suck into the carbs. I have an 2.0 79' T4
engine. Do u guys know which size of jets do i have to use to make the gas
consume afordable?! How am i supossed to travel, when i'll have to spend a
fortune on gas (100 lts x 100 km?) Vacum lines are all conected, timing is
at 7,5° BTDC, engine is rebuild. When the engine is cold, it drowns on the
too much gas being injected, it does not respond to the acelerator at all.
What have i done wrong?
Please help reducing these insane gas costs
Otherwise my 77° Kombi will stay inside the garage for ever...
Thanks beforhand for ur help

Michel
