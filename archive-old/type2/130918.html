Subject: RE: [T2] Re: yellow film/oil snot/mayonaisse

I'm using Castrol and I get it (yellow film/oil snot/mayonnaise)

I get it with both &quot;Castrol GTX&quot; and &quot;Castrol GTX high mileage&quot;

I used to have the same problems with Castrol myself.  I have since switched 
to Chevron's Delo400, and it stays foam-free for it's lifetime in the 
engine.
