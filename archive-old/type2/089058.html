Subject: Re: [T2] FI cyl head question

Why would the FI temp sensor hole be plugged? It is a blind hole.
The temp sensor hole is 10mm x 1.0. Looks like a large tin screw hole.

Are you sure these are not 1800 heads with air injection passages plugged? The
air injection passage goes thru into the exhaust port.
The threads are deep in the hole.

What is the cast-in part number on these heads?


&gt; i just received shippment of my heads from rimco. they hadn't removed the
&gt; plug that lives in the threaded hole for the cyl head temp sensor. any
&gt; ideas removing this plug? its round; not allen or hex or anything.   -steve
