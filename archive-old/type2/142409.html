Subject: Re: [T2] Opinions on backfire

Hello Dave  How ya doing   well I hope   Are you finally going to camp with 
us in your own Bus?   If you dont have it ready for naturalbus let me know and 
you can use the GHOOST again .    On your backfiring it sounds like the carbs 
aren't set right. I bet you will find that they are still open when you  
aren't on the throttle and the butterflys are still open slightly. This will cause 
fuel to get sucked into the cambers and they will pop just from the heat .  
later  mark dearing
