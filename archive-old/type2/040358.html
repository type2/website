&gt; 
&gt; I'm currently looking at the Subaru SVX 6-cylinder.  I am trying to figure
&gt; out if the Subaru tranny can have its ring gear flipped like a VW's for
&gt; bus use.  This would give a nice 5-speed transmission with the ratios to
&gt; match the power!

--&gt; I've heard it claimed that flipping the ring gear in a VW transmission
(for example, to use it with a Corvair engine) makes it last about 5,000
miles instead of 500,000, due to everything turning the wrong direction
inside.  Might want to think twice about doing that to a Subaru tranny.
