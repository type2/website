I was just reading a few postings on taking compression tests on a hot ,
or warm engine.
The fear here seems to be getting burnt fingers by the hot plugs.
There is a very easy solution to this, and I have used it many times.
Loosen the plug and unscrew it almost all the way out.
Take a piece of small vacuum line, or fuel line, and push it down onto
the plug, and unscrew the plug the rest of the way out.
The plug can be started in the same manner---------no burnt fingers, and
this also allows you to start a plug that may be difficult to get to.

Simple--

Later,
