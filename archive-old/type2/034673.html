&gt;Thanks for all the ideas and tips on my suddenly weenie '78 2 liter.
&gt;Tried everything suggested thus far except for the clogged cat/con
&gt;idea (the guy at the muffle shop thought I was nuts when asked to
&gt;take a look at the rig.  He said &quot;...the little mice inside can't
&gt;run that fast if there's a clogged converter.&quot; Ha ha. . .).

I like the clogged cat idea.  You might try loosening the flange between
the muffler and the cat a little to relieve the (assumed) pressure.  If
that's your problem, it will wake the engine up (and your neighbors too -
don't do it at night!).

&gt;# 6 is the only thing that made any difference.  The engine could rev.
&gt;a little higher but still had poor power.  A new symptom appeared--the
&gt;oil light now comes on a idle and must be adjusted quite a bit higher
&gt;to prevent it staying on.

That indicates to me that the motor might be overheating, which would go
along with the clogged converter problem.  Your motor is making the same
power, just 90% of it is being used to push the exhaust out.  Also, put
your hand over the exhaust pipe at idle (cold engine).  Do you feel strong
pulses and lots of air coming out?  If not, another vote for the clogged
cat.
