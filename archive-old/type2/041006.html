Subject: Re: Oil temp

I have heard/read a myriad of conflicting information on this topic.  Some
people say it should not go over 180. Some say 220.  Others say 260.  During
summer in Florida my temp is regularly at 220 around town and as high as
240-250 on the highway.  During winter it usually never tops 200.  Others
say that the guages are useless anyway (i.e. Gene Berg).  I use my guages as
a day-to-day indicator.  I know what my van usually runs at and if it gets
too high above normal, I let it cool down.  I don't think anyone can give
you an exact answer, based on your particular
bus/guage/sender/location/local temperature/driving habits/angular alignment
of your town to the 3 largest  moons of Jupiter/, as to how high it should
go.  If it gets hot, you'll know.

&gt; Just bought a VDO Oil temp gauge with a dip stick temp sensor. What is an
&gt; acceptable temp and where do I pull off the road and let her cool down.
I'm
&gt; planning a trip to the rockies in a few weeks and an oil temp gauge was
&gt; suggested. Just took a trip to the store and back and it just topped 220F.
