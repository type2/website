Subject: Re: [T2] junkyard engine and trany prices

Hi,

The cors seem to be around $400 or so.  If the bus is wrecked and not in the
boneyard for a bad engine, you have a chanve at a deal.  Watch where all of
the F.I. wires go and remove those components also.  Remember the brain, fuel
pump, and double relay.  If you study the wiring diagram, you will see it is
not too difficult.  Do you have an automatic now?  Check with other listers
and ask if changing from the manual to auto trans is a good idea.  I am not
sure, are the drive axles the same for both the manual and auto trans?  I
rebuilt a VW auto trans once and it was fairly easy.  I have rebuilt several
auto and manual trans for other, mostly American vehicles over the past 30
years.

Keep smiling,

Mike
