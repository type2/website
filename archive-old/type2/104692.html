Subject: Re: [T2] NAPA  ball joint snafu

Shouldn't her address be &quot;gothernailed_at_aol_dot_com b/c I think the mechanic 
needs to be replaced and is looking for reasons to jack the price. 
Measuring her ability to pay and how much she does or does not know.

Good luck - Casey - I've got to second Dave's statement. If he can't get 
the old out, I have no confidence he'll get the parts installed correctly. 
Make sure he stays away from the arms with a torch. A little heat might 
help (shouldn't need it) but alot might ruin the heat treatment and you've 
got an instant safety hazard on the road.

&gt;Would anyone else care to forward a note
&gt;to Casey &lt; GotUnailed_at_aol_dot_com &gt; and
&gt;explain why a hacksaw is not the proper tool
&gt;for replacing ball joints in the torsion arms ?
&gt;Her NAPA machinist is having a hard time.
&gt;He says it's the &quot;worst&quot; set he's ever done.
&gt;I'm thinking she misunderstood, and he
&gt;actually said it's the &quot;first&quot; set he's ever done.
&gt;I've suggested she take a Bentley to the store
&gt;and request to see the tools required.
