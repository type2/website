The PO of my '78 Westy did that.  I'm not impressed with it.
Granted, the heater boxes aren't the best anymore, but IMHO
this setup delivers too little warmth up at the windshield,
where in winter you need it the most, and not enough warm
air in the rear to be noticeable by the driver at all.

I'd rather have all the warm air I can get up front.  But
of course, YMMV.

Airhowlingly yours,
