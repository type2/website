Subject: clutch lever adjustment?

Hello all!

This weekend I was installing a new clutch cable and noticed that the PO
had placed various other bolts and washers under the wingnut in order to
obtain the proper pedal freeplay (i assumed this was from the cable
stretching and went on with my work).  However, when it came time for me to
adjust the freeplay using the new cable, I realized that I was in a similar
situation.  This appears to be caused by the clutch lever arm not being
oriented straight up and down, but rather angled somewhat towards the front
of the bus...

Is it possible to adjust the orientation of the lever arm without removing
the engine, or is this a situation I'm going to have to live with until the
next engine pull?

Thanks.
Chris.
