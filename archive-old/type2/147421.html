Subject: Re: [T2] I need a part and the bus depot doesn't have it!

Just curious, how did you determine it was shot?  Did you use a 
multimeter and test the resistance between the leads?  The unit can be 
cleaned and also disassembled if you're careful and make alignment marks 
to put it back together properly.

&gt;   I have determined my auxillary air regulator is shot, and I need a new one.  Unfortunately the bus depot doesn't have it!
