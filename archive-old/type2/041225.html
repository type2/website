Subject: 73 original slide top removed/now has permanent bubble top

Hello all,
just towed in a 73 type2 automatic, it originally had a slide top over the
passenger area. don't know what you call that model. It's been sitting here,
at the beach, for about 2 years.  The slide top has been removed and an
aftermarket plastic bubble top was installed by the P.O..

the P.O. had some outside oil coolers installed on each side and the
mechanic who sold him the job ($500) ran copper tubing from an adapter at
the oil filter to each side about 6&quot; from the muffler to each side. what an
idiot!  Well for some reason the  P.O. had it towed and the tow truck driver
raised it up and towed it from the front and knocked off one of the tubes.
I removed the oil coolers and the copper tubing &amp; capped the lines at the
oil filter adapter.

I have adjusted the valves (to .006 intake and exhaust) cleaned the gas
tank, replaced: oil filter,fuel lines, fuel filter, main air filter,
replaced: spark plugs ( it had autolite plugs  ) with bosch W7CC, did
compression check 130 to 135 all around. I will be changing the points, cap,
rotor, condenser, and setting the timing today.

I got it running, though it's strong when you rev it up, it doesn't  idle
very well.  Maybe after the rest of the tune up it will be okeh, or, may
need to do carb kit's.

It has the original carbs, and, I believe a 1700 stock engine.  I am sure
there is much more to check out vacuum leaks?  and the electrical cutoff
switch stuff to the carbs etc. Just wanted to share this with the list and
maybe get some additional tips, or ideas, of what more i can do to help get
it to running smooothly.

Once I get it running  well, it will be for sale if your interested let me
know at: orgvw_at_yahoo_dot_com

Bob
