Subject: Re: [T2] Ac compressor on a Type iV 2L?

lukas sends:

&gt; Dear all,
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to put a compresor in the back of my 1979 2L to use as
&gt; an air compressor.
&gt; I have heared that a &quot;york&quot; would be good. Has anyone got an AC system on a
&gt; 2L?
&gt; WHere does the extra pulley go? Alternator or fan?
&gt; Any input welcome including parts and pictures.
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; 
&gt; Lukas
&gt; 
&gt; PS: Want to be able to pump the tires on the move after driving in
&gt; sand, in case you are wondering...

Pump the tires on the move? Oh boy.

If you have an army base near you, go to the town close to it and look for
an army truck. There are two kinds I know of that have on-the-move inflation
systems, the new-generation 5-ton and the Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles
2.5-ton. You would not believe how complex the air plumbing out to the tires
is--I don't think you could do it on a Bus without replacing a *lot* of
parts on the wheel hubs.

I'd just get one of those little tire-inflator compressors they sell at the
FLAPS and use that.
