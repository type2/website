Subject: WHY ARE YOU STILL SENDING ME MAIL

I BLOCKED YOUR E MAILS MONTHS AGO AND HAVE STARTED RECEIVING THEM AGAIN AT A REDICULOUS RATE. I DO NOT WANT THEM AND HAVE NOW STARTYED REPORTING THEM AS SPAM TO AOL. I AM GETTING SEVERAL HUNDRED E MAILS A DAY FROM PEOPLE ON THE TYPE 2 LIST AND I HAVE A BLOCK ON IT. NOW THE E MAILS ARE COMING FROM OTHER SOURCES BUT STILL COMING. IF I WANT MORE E-MAIL FROM YOUR SITE I WILL REMOVE THE BLOCK UNTIL THEN PLEASE STOP THESE FROM COMING.
THANKS,
