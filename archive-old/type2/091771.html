Subject: head temp sensor length

I took four hours putting a oil pressure gauge into the westy today 
because i set a rule for myself.  I measured out a 16.5 foot length of 
wire and set out trying to run just that length to dashboard of the 
westy.  Reason for that is that this is the max length i could find 
advertised for a head temp sensor and lead.  Could not do it.  Shortest 
run  is  18.5 feet to where the gauge will be positioned.  Does anybody 
know if VDO makes a run longer than 15 foot?  cant seem to find one.
