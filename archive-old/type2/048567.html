I believe it's from moisture in the oil.  Something to worry about if you
were water cooled - (leaking head gasket), but probably just from humidity
in your case.  I get it all the time with my '77.  I've never smelled it
though.

The thing I'd heard about multi-weight oils was that they brake down easier
when overheated and that's why some folks say to use straight 40 or
whatever.  Though this could be folklore also..  Does anyone know?

Good luck,

&gt; I went out this morning and checked my oil before I left for the day, it
was
&gt; about 25 degrees, I was a little low, so I opened the filler lid on my 74
&gt; and there was a cream colored substance that smelled like gas! My dipstick
&gt; had normal oil on it, and didn't smell like gas, so I topped it off and it
&gt; ran just fine. Has anyone ever had this happen before? what is it? I just
&gt; had my engine rebuilt about 5,000 miles ago, so i hope there is nothing
&gt; wrong with it. Anyways, it appears to just be on the underside of the
filler
&gt; lid, I am runing 10w40 Any thoughts would be helpful.
&gt;
&gt; Another question I had was about something on the list I read a few days
&gt; ago, I believe someoe said not to run 10w anything if you want your engine
&gt; to last. My mechanic told me to use 20w50 in the summer and 10w40 in the
&gt; winter, I haven't had any problems yet, is there something he and I don't
&gt; know?
