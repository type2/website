Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel line replacement

Guess what I discovered while underneath trying to get the starter out? 

The hose from the tank to the fuel filter was NOT replaced when the
shop replaced my fuel lines for $100. Grrrrr... It is still in good
condition so I can wait until the bus is running again to go buy some
more. I just couldn't believe they charged me that much and didn't do
the part that spits onto a sparking electrical device!

(Note to self: Shops suck. But we already knew that...)
