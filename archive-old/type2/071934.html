&gt;Problem.  Had an engine rebuild 1500km ago on a 2 ltr   '74 Kombi - ran
&gt;pretty well when I picked it up but I noticed the vacuum guage I fitted
&gt;ages ago showed there wasn't as good a vacuum as the old motor.  I'm
&gt;sure that when decelerating, the previous motor used to move the gauge
&gt;into the 'Decelerate' range - i.e. over 22 inches of mercury and under
&gt;pretty strong deceleration it would get up to 24   &quot; Hg.  Now with the
&gt;new motor, the best vacuum I get under deceleration is about 20 (this is
&gt;around the middle of the 'Drive' range of the gauge).

If it's a &quot;new&quot; new motor, give the rings some time to break in.  A new
motor will not pull as much vacuum as one with a few thousand miles on it.

Also, how does the compression ratio of your new engine compare with the
old one?  If the old one had a higher compression ratio, it would pull more
vacuum.

20 is not really bad - that's what I see on my 2-liter with dual carbs.
Sometimes I see 21 if the engine has been working hard and is good and
warm, such as when I'm coasting down a freeway offramp.

&gt;After a few other problems I'm now having trouble getting the bus to run
&gt;smoothly and had a VW mechanic tune it; after that it seemed to have
&gt;less power.  I suspect there may be a problem with loss of vacuum
&gt;somewhere.  I have isolated the balance pipe that feeds the brake
&gt;booster to rule out anything in front of the engine bay by bridging the
&gt;two carbys direct with some hose &amp; idling it, and I have checked and
&gt;double checked the balance pipe between the two carbies. I've sprayed
&gt;WD-40 around the various gaskets and pipe joints hunting for leaks there
&gt;to no avail.

You probably don't have a vacuum leak then.  Have you checked that your
idle jets are operational?  If you have those stupid cutoff solenoids,
check them carefully.  I often find the little hole in the end plugged up
by some piece of crud.  Check your timing too, I'd go with 7 BTDC if you
have a dual vacuum distributor.

&gt;Before I start pulling the carbies apart looking for ill fitted
&gt;diaphrgms etc I just want to find out what the standard vacuum should be
&gt;when its running on idle at operating temperature.

Mine is around 15 at warm idle (1200 rpm).
