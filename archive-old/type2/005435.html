in addition to confusion, proper plug orientation in the distributor
prevents plug wires from crossing one another, which CAN LEAD  to ignition
energy crossing from one wire into another, firing the wrong plug at the
wrong time, which is a surefire way to break stuff real quick. If you run it
this way, BE SURE the plug wires are in great shape or better.
