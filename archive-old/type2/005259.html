It turned out to be a rusty distributor, the mechanic cleaned it and greased
it and now it works great, he said this might last a week or a year, but I
will have to replace the original distributor that is a vacume advance with
a 009 distributor, but he said the old ones are much better so another idea
he said for the same cost is to put an electric distributor thing in
conjunction with my old distributor so it will still use the vacume advance
stuff.

Any thoughts?

Thanks,
Bob
