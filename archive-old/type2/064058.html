Subject: Want list (Wanna sell some parts?)

As I sit here tonight, composing my want list for the Bug-Out next
weekend, I figured to post it in case anyone has a basement full of parts
they are lookin' to get rid of, or are just willing to part with.  If you
have anything on the attached list and want to sell (give?) it to me,
please send the part name and price.
