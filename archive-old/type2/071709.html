Pat:

  I bought one last month and have been going to report to the list 
its effectiveness as soon as  I can thoroughly test it and become 
competent in its operation.  I don't feel I  am there yet but with 
your query I feel I must give a preliminary response.

I ordered the basic model (CO only) for $170.  They shipped me the 
&quot;deluxe&quot; model (listed for $250) for the same cost. This model is a 
dwell, tach and volt meter also.   It arrived promptly within a few 
days which is not normal for my previous experience with JCW.

I began using this unit to diagnose my 87 Vanagon's richness and HC 
problem.  At first this was a frustrating process.  You first have to 
calibrate the unit to outside air and a 2% calibration.  Because It 
kept coming up with high CO figures I originally questioned the 
accurracy of this unit.  Finally when my family brought home other 
vehicles with what I feel were accurately in spec CO readings I 
determined that the unit was indeed accurate and would read CO under 
1% somewhat accurately.

I finally found the problems with my 87 and it confirmed that these 
corrections did indeed bring it into spec.  So far I would have to 
say that the unit does indeed work.  Having said that, I wouldn't at 
this time recommend anyone else buy one.  First it's construction is 
crap.  Very cheap plastic.  Very poor construction.  What it actually 
is and does is not worth this kind of money.  They have taken a 
similar technology to a lambda sensor and just fitted it with a 
metered read out.  I have seen better dwell/tach, and volt meters for 
less than $30.  Let me repeat though that it does appear to work.  I 
am satisfied for my use that I didn't get taken to much in its 
purchase.  I say this because I have 12 vehicles with different 
emmissions systems for which a simple O2 sensor and Volt meter won't 
work or at least be convenient.

I would not recommend this unit to others though.  First, a cheaper 
and just as efficient means of testing a closed loop system is 
applying a good digital volt meter (say $40) to the O2 sensor 
circuit.  I welded a 18 mm threaded insert to my 77 Bus's exhaust 
manifold and it gives me just as accurate idea of CO output / 
richness as this unit does and it costs under $30.  The problem is 
neither shows HC content and to accurately set up your FI sytem you 
need to balance each.

If any one is interested in doing their own CO adjustments I would 
recommend first reading the Bosch FI articles in the bay window 
library.  If you are still interested I would recommend reading two 
books available at you favorite &quot;free, public&quot; library---Barnes and 
Noble:&quot; Bosch FI &amp; Engine Management&quot; by Charles Probst and &quot;How to 
Tune &amp; Modify Bosch FI&quot; by Ben Watson.  I know Digifant is not Bosch 
but it is very close to Bosch Mototronic and is also the successor to 
Bosch L Jetronic and the same principles apply.  In the chapters in 
these that have to do with basic emmissions sciense is very 
interesting and if studied will give you a better idea what the 
relationship is between CO, HC, and NOx before and after a CAT.


Anyone local I would be glad to use this unit to test your FI.  I 
won't lend it out because I fear this unit is to fragile to come back 
in one piece.

Steve

I am considering buying a exhaust analyzer.  There is one at JC Whitney MDL
#12ZX5486B that I am thinking about.  Anybody have any experience with this
or any other consumer model?  Are they accurate?  It sure would seem to save
me some money.  About the only reason I go to mechanics is for the CO
adjustment.  This model is also a ignition/battery tester.  Thanks.
