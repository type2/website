&gt; Just a reminder, I have seen more than one Volkswagen burnt to the ground
&gt; from an engine fire. One thing I have noticed is most of the time the fuel
&gt; inlet tube is missing from the carburetor. This tube is a press in fit. I
&gt; make it a habit of taping this tube in any time I have the fuel line off.
&gt; Another thing is fuel filters between the pump and carburetor. This is the
&gt; pressure side of the system, the filter should be on the suction side.

There is considerable debate on this.  A filter on the suction side makes
things more prone to vapor lock.  However I have never experienced this on
a VW, and I believe that some models actually came with a filter just
after the tank.  I use a filter on the pressure side, but it made of metal
and is securely clamped on the line.  The filter is the same configuration
as the normal in-line filter.  I forget the exact number, but it was
stocked at the local FLAPS as a replacement for a Japanese car.

&gt; Anytime you have a failure on the pressure side, fuel is spraying until the
&gt; engine dies from lack of fuel in the carburetor. By then you have a very big
&gt; fire going.

True, but even a break on the suction side is bad news, since the system
is gravity-feed.  The prime location for breaks is where the fuel line
passes throught the front tin, right above the exhaust pipe.
