List,
I pulled the tank from my 71 today. This is a bus with no engine or tranny.
Just thought i'd post the procedure for anyone else that needs to half-ass it.
;p
Realized that there are four screws underneath holding the cover on after
pulling and cursing for a few minutes. (RTFM) Found that my filler tube is in
good shape (whew!).

Anyway, i pulled it, removed the sending unit (wonder how to test this
thing?), threw a couple handfuls of gravel in it and shook for a while.
Knocked alot of rust off like that, but wanted to go further.

As far as cleaning agents are concerned, the only thing i had handy (i tend to
work with whats available) was some 'The Works' household cleaner.  From what
i can tell, this is phosphoric acid whith some other stuff.
I added some more gravel, and shook for a while.
I discovered that phospohoric acid likes limestone; when i drained it, the
rocks were etched - and a white residue (lime?) rubbed off them.

I put a gallon of water in the tank, sloshed it and poured out white, foamy
water.
Filled it again with a couple gallons, sloshed and poured out some more white
foamy stuff.
Kept on flushing until i got clear water.

To dry it i took a hair dryer, taped it to the fuel inlet and set the tank on
a milk crate with the sending unit hole facing down.
With the dryer on high, the tank was dry in 10 minutes or so, but still
smelled like the cleaner. I flushed it again a few times and dried it again.
Still smells faintly of the cleaner, but the internal surface of the tank
looks as good as it is going to get without a professional job.
The tank was reinstalled after i 409'd, scrubbed and sprayed out the engine
comartment. Boy, what a difference that made. Nice, clean engine comartment
now.

I plan to flush the tank with a couple gallons of gasoline before i use it.  I
feel confident the tank will do well, provided i didn't commit a booboo by
unsing the phosphor.

Thanks folks,

clark
