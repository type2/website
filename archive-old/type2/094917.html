Subject: how a tach works?



Hello,

Never owned a tach before, and one was in the blank clock spot when I got 
the bus, but never worked or was never connected.

There seem to be only two wires coming out of it, what do these hook up to?
I would guess one to a ground and one to the coil maybe?

Here is a picture of the tach I have :
