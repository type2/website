Subject: [T2] emergency flashers work, turn signals don't?? 

So flicked on the emerg.flashers today, no problem all lights blinked 
merrily away on my newly acquired 79 Westy. No turn signals at all 
however. I also don't have a hi/low that is working. The turnsignal 
stalk doesn't seem to be doing either function. What should I check 
next, open up the steering column? Any suggestions (besides researching 
the archives) :-)
