Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] using a cyl head temp sensor for oil temp?

The risk is that the plug might not sit properly in the hole.
-----------------------------
I've had #3 spark plug out three times and each time the sender goes back
in with the same tight bend, keeps working. Anything else that you
require for $12.00.
You could of course pull some engine tin and put it under a head bolt.
