Subject: how do I test my fuel pump?

Is there an easy and safe way to test my fuel pump?  I've got a fuel 
injected 77 westy.  I had posted earlier about my starting troubles and 
decided to check the fuel filter.  The gas that came out of the line 
when I replaced the filter was brown.  It looked like rust.  The filter 
didn't seem to have particles of anything, but it had lots of that brown 
gas it in.  Is it possible that the fuel pump died because of the bad gas? 

I'd like to find out how I can check the pump.  I'd rather not spend the 
150 for a new pump if I don't have to...   I'm going to check the FI 
also and see if the injectors are gummed up.

Thanks.
