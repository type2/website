&gt; Good Dr. Tim recommended checking the &quot;crankshaft endplay.&quot;  I have the 
&gt; Hayes, &amp; think I have an idea of what you're referring to, Doc.  It sounds 
&gt; like I'd have to break open the case to do this, yes?  Anything else I might 
&gt; be able to inspect, to give me a better feeling?

No, endplay is checked externally.  Just attach a dial indicator to the
case with the stem touching the flywheel and pointing parallel to the
crankshaft.  Push the crank into the engine ,, note the indicator reading,
pull the crank out of the engine, note the reading again, tne subtract to
get the end play.  A properly rebuilt engine should have an endplay in the
&quot;new&quot; range (.003-.005 inch)  The wear limit is .006 inch.  Do not accept
an engine with an end play greater than .005.  Even if you have to walk
for a few days, it isn't worth it to install a junk engine.

&gt; So:  forging ahead, against the advice of many.  I have some more install 
&gt; questions, and would be most appreciative of list member input.  A few folks 
&gt; said:  yes, put the cooling tins/engine compartment seal on before putting 
&gt; back in.  OK - BUT, this sounds difficult.

Nope, it's impossible to do the other way round.  Well, not impossible,
but pretty difficult.  You leave off the rear and side cover plates, as
well as the oil filler, until the engine is in

  What about the &quot;shaft&quot; that goes 
&gt; between the transmission &amp; the engine (don't know the common name/couldn't 
&gt; seem to find in Hayes).  Is there any special way this should be installed 
&gt; into the motor &amp; the tranny?

OH-OH!  Are you telling us that the transmission input shaft came out of
the transmission?  If so, you've got a transmission repair on your hands
before you can install the engine.  The input shaft should be firmly
attached to the transmission.

  Will there be any problems w/this while 
&gt; jacking the motor back into the compartment?  Any tricks y'all know of?  I'm 
&gt; just thinking of how far we (my buddy &amp; I) had to back the motor out of the 
&gt; tranny (w/tin already removed) to get &quot;that shaft&quot; clear.  With the tin on 
&gt; before installation, it doesn't seem like I'll have enough play to slide it 
&gt; in there, also considering the angle.

Ah, now I see.  You leave off the side and rear cover plates, as well as
the oil filler until the engine is in.  This gives you the clearance you
need.
