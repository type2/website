Subject: Re: [T2] tune-up madness

Thanks,
I figured something like what you propose was
possible. It seems like there should be a knob or a
allen-head on the outside of the distributor so you
could adjust while the engine is running. But that
wouldn't build character.

Don't have a helper so I think what I'm going to do is
buy a new set of points. Feeler gauge the gap, pray,
then check with the dwell. It should make it a little
easier.

i owned several VWs in my 20s--ghia, bus, single cab,
squareback. I always set the points with a feeler
gauge and a file. Now, i get the 68 bus (i'm 50) and
try to use a dwell meter and I'm baffled. Now, I gotta
wonder if the point settings I did in my youth were
even close!

&gt; OK,
&gt; 
&gt; Here is my trick on setting points.
&gt; 
&gt; You have to have a helper or remote start switch
&gt; though.
&gt; 
&gt; Put the new points in and adjust &quot;close&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; Start the engine and see what the dwell says.
&gt; Pull the dist cap and rotor and have your buddy
&gt; crank the
&gt; engine long enough for you to get a feel for the
&gt; difference
&gt; in what it was running v.s. what it is when
&gt; cranking.
