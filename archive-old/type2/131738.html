Subject: Re: [T2] Distributeur and progressive weber kit

Michael Knight
'77 Westy Deluxe, &quot;el Verde&quot;





&gt;From: Paul Manning Now, I had the 009 because a PO replaced the dual carbs 
&gt;with the Weber,
&gt;replaced the stock distributor with the 009 and removed other
&gt;components as well. Here are a few things you shouldn't do when you
&gt;install that carb:
&gt;Do not remove the cooling air flaps nor thermostat. You still need them
&gt;regardless of what your mechanic or documentation might say. For some
&gt;reason, Webers, 009's and missing cooling air systems seem to travel in
&gt;packs (at least that's what I hear, I'm pretty new to this, but it
&gt;happened with hapy).

I bought a '77 Model with the exact same PO options installed. Going back to 
the Stock FI.

&gt;Do not disconnect the fuel vent lines and charcoal canister. Unless you
&gt;want gas fumes venting into your engine bay (boom), figure out a way to
&gt;connect them back into the new air filter. I'm still working on this
&gt;one myself, so hapy stays put until I do.

If you have the oil breather line going into the carb you could tee into it.

&gt;Do not disconect the air preheating system. The documentation and/or
&gt;your mechanic might say you don't need them. Untrue. Warm air means
&gt;better warm ups in winter, and smoother running when the ambient temp
&gt;changes. I found a Sprint aircleaner instead of the chromy did the
&gt;trick.
