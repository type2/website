Subject: Re: [T2] securing strap

Its like a little belt with buckle. A bracelet sized belt.
In the early bays anyway yours may be
the same. I can snap a picture if you need.

&gt; I was looking through the &quot;Campmobile&quot; supplement and saw that the
&gt; camping stool is supposed to have a securing strap that attaches to
&gt; the side of the icebox on my 73 Camper.
&gt;  I have never seen this strap. I have the metal bracket attached,
&gt; however.
&gt; Does anyone have a spare one of these they could sell, or can anyone
&gt; tell me how to fabricate one?
&gt; Is it the plastic snap on kind, or a webbed affair like on the spare
&gt; tire?
