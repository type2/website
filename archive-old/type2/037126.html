Next time you'll know better!  You should be able to install the engine
without forcing it with the bolts.

&gt; The clutch package is one I found with the 71 SC and parts that I had gotten

Not a good assumption!

&gt; I pulled the engine today and found the end of the guide sleeve(covers the

&gt; feels a little odd when turning it by hand(maybe just me) and the ring that
&gt; was on the little fingers on the pressure plate was dangling on the input
&gt; shaft when I pulled the engine out.

There is your problem,  You have a late model throwout bearing and an
early pressure plate.  Late pressure plates allow the throwout bearing to
ride directly on the fingers without the ring that you found dangling.

You need to replace the pressure plate with a late model item.  Since the
throwout bearing is questionable, then you need to replace it with the
proper late model part as well.

The clutch disc is the same for early and late.
