&lt;&lt; Hardly.  The stock OIL cooling system on a type 4 is marginal at best.  The
5% grade, 100 degree air temp scenario you mention with heavy throttle for
longer than a few minutes will cause oil temps to skyrocket to unsafe
levels even in a meticulously maintaned Stock engine.  Been there, done
that.  Have to be extra stingy with the throttle under those conditions to
protect the motor, or become another statistic, broken down on the side of
the road. &gt;&gt;

Speaking of statistics...Anyone have 'em on the Vans when they actually were
new? MPG, repair records...etc. Be interesting to try and figure out what the
lifespan of various components was originally supposed to be and how far most
of us have gone beyond that figure. The engine life interests me most...I 
don't
think that &quot;new&quot; owners did much beyond what the warranty required - normal
service at the dealer? Present owners, by necessity, are much more involved
with their van's mechanicals...Were &quot;new&quot; owners? I wonder how many &quot;new&quot;
van engines survived their laissez faire owners?
Anyone know if something like Consumer Reports kept tabs on the vans when
they were still on the showroom floor?
