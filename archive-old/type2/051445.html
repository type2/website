&gt; Gentlepersons-
&gt; A friend of mine came across (most) of a wooden roof rack that will fit my
&gt; type 2...Alas, some of the pieces that are missing are spindles. Now I've
&gt; already got a wood lathe so I could spec out the existing spindles and
&gt; duplicate them that way, but I know that other pantograph assemblies are
&gt; available to facilitate replication. I'd rather not buy one and was curious if
&gt; anyone knew of a site/source for a DIY machine or, if anyone has one, was it
&gt; worth the price?

Ask on the Usenet rec.crafts.woodturning. Someone there will know.
