Re: the meaning of flashing on's beams to signal whether or not it is safe
for the car/truck ahead of you to slide into your lane:

        Malcom is right.  The flashing means &quot;it is safe so go ahead.&quot;  Ask
any truck driver.  It is a clearance/courtesy technique at least 20 yrs
old.
        The meaning of flashing to anyone in the opposite traffic direction
should also be obvious to everyone.  This is all old news.
