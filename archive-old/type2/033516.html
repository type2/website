Whoa...  If the engine doesn't budge with that sort of punishment, it must
be well and truly seized.  The best thing to do would be to drop the engine
and tear it down to find out what's happened to it.

&gt; I hear no starter sounds.  I had a friend tow me while I tried to pop
&gt; the clutch.  I was unsuccessful.  In fact the tires just locked and
&gt; dragged.  I got no engine turn over... Any ideas.....
