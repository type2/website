Subject: Re: [T2] Driving with a bad valve

I also agree with towing it...
 BUT if you have to drive it as mentioned above, I definitely agree with
removing the push rods, this will eliminate the valves from moving therefore
reducing (not eliminating) the potential valve seat breaking into pieces and
hammering your head, piston cylinder, and could possibly do much more
damage.
 Once, I bought an 81 AC engine out of the junkyard, and the previous owner
had driven it even after the power/compression loss (valve seat dropping
from head) and the seat had broken into peices, hammered the head (cuts
almost 1/2 deep!) and actually had hammered a hole through the piston.
Unfortuantely the bits of valve seat had made its way into the crank
bearings and case bearings, even scored the lifters and cam. Nothing was
salvagable from that engine.
 If you have another vehicle that can tow it home, or even if you have a
neighbor or friend that has something to tow it with, that would be the way
to go. Dont risk it. (Even if the engine is already toast, you wouldnt want
to be stuck on the side of the road).
 Good luck!
Happy bussing,

&gt; &gt; I'm looking at an '80 that has (what I was told) a bad valve (valve

&gt; &gt; If I was to ground the spark plug wire to the bad cylinder (it's
&gt; &gt; already running on 3 with the bad valve)... I was thinking that
&gt; &gt; without the cylinder firing the valve wouldn't be stressed and it
&gt; &gt; ought to make.
&gt; &gt; Any thoughts?
&gt;
&gt; well if you are adamant about driving it home, I would agree to use a roll
&gt; back, but if you have no other choice. I would
&gt; . remove the spark plug,
&gt; . remove the fuel injector wires
&gt; . remove the push rods
&gt; . remove all excess weight from the bus
&gt;
&gt; removing the push rods is probably the most important,
&gt;
&gt; drive at very slow RPM even if it was SLIGHTLY lugging.
&gt;
&gt; stop at the first indication that ANYTHING was amiss.
