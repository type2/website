Subject: Re: [T2] timing question

[...]
thats almost 13 degrees variance, which is about the vacuum advance.  
Are you getting vacuum to the dizzy?  or is the can diaphram bad?

&gt; I believe the timing is advancing as I increase speed... I'll have to
&gt; double check.  I am setting the timing with vacuum attached.  By no 
&gt; power,
&gt; I mean the bus is sorely underpowered across the whole spectrum; at full
&gt; throttle the bus limps along.  When I set timing to 7.5BTDC, everything
&gt; is magically better and the bus is responsive.
&gt;
&gt; Other oddities still persist, which may or may not be related.  The gas
&gt; milage (checked yesterday for the first time since the rebuild) is about
&gt; 11mpg, city driving, with timing set at magic optimum.  Also, high
&gt; temps (260+) continue with sustained usage.  I'm just trying to isolate
&gt; what is happening here...
