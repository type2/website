Subject: Re: thermostat and flaps

I can't believe that the VW engineers were so off the mark on this design 
that we should throw away our thermostats.
When you have trouble with the flaps not opening sufficiently it is usually 
because your thermostat is fatigued (stretched) and so when you hook up the 
flap wire to such a thermostat (tightly closed flaps when engine is cold) 
the thermostat is limited mechanically as to how much further it can stretch 
out. As a result, the flaps open only partially no matter how hot the engine 
gets.
The solution is not to remove the old thermostat, but rather to buy a new 
one! Even in California, you'll warm up more quickly, and get really good 
heat when neeeded, if you have a properly operating thermostat.
For what its worth,
