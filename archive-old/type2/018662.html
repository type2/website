Bus sighting:
Front page of the Chicago Tribune Monday, June 21, 1999. A Reuters photo
by Russel Boyce. The caption doesn't say anything about the bus in the
foreground, but it's in Kosovo, no doubt, and it's a 73-79 white loaf
with several serious modifications. It has a radiator mounted on the
nose,aftemarket mirrors, no drivers door handle, possibly all left side
windows blown out, and, possibly most significant, a bullet hole that
looks like it got the driver right between the eyes. (Ain't war great!)
This has not dissuaded the occupants, three of whom are pushing the bus
down a hill. Maybe it was stuck?
Looks like it was a pretty clean loaf before the war.
