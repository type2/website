Good Morning List,
I received this from another list I am on and thought many on this list may
be interested. 

Randall and Kermit the Bus (The lean, mean, green machine)

New Magazine!if you are feeling jaded by endless recounts (!) and want
something to look forward to then read on! Finally there is a glossy mag
dedicated only to buses. Initially it is bound to be Brit-orientated but I
will be freelancing for the new mag and am keen to get Neatoites and bus
lovers on the other side of the pond interested...there are some wild and
awesome buses with you guys and it would be nice to get some stories and
spec and pics..the new mag does not want to be parochial ... so if all you
ever get is  little bus bits in VW Trends and Hot VW's then maybe you wanna
check out this new publication and feed your addiction! First issue has a
fabulous Westy featured!
check out www.vwcamper.co_dot_uk for a bit more info and a sneak preview of the
first issue cover (the website is something that is planned to be special
and unique once things get up and running.)
Pass the news onto your chapters and friends, and to any bus nuts who might
be interested.
Can someone pass on LIMBO contact as I appear to have lost it..and the
Vintage VW guys...
The new mag will cover ALL buses..and its kinda appropriate that in the
fiftieth anniversary year that the VW Bus finally gets its own special mag!
Drive your buses...enjoy your buses...happy greetings from England 2/3 of
which which is currently under about 20 foot of water!

NEW MAGAZINE

from Jazz Publishing (publishers of Total VW)


The Volkswagen Type 2, Transporter, Bus, Kombi, Camper, Van, Microbus... 
whatever you want to call it... is one of the best known motor vehicles of
all
time. More than just a van, it has become to many people - to use a well
worn
phrase - a way of life. Over the past 50 years the VW has been seen in every

corner of the world, being driven by every type of person of every age and
background. It's a classic vehicle that has seen many changes but always
remained true to its original premise - a box on wheels. But what a box...

The broad appeal of the VW remains, and it's popularity remains undiminished
- in fact many would say it's growing every day. Older 'split-screens' are
now
true collectors items that can be worth small fortunes. 1970s 'bay-windows'
are
gaining respect as a real classic while remaining a practical everyday
vehicle, 
and 1980s 'Wedge' Type 25s are now finally being accepted by the purists, 
being the last link to the companies' original product - the Beetle. They
all have
their place within 'Volkswagen Camper and Commercial', a new magazine
designed to appeal to anyone with an interest in these most unique of
vehicles.

The publication looks to cover all aspects of buying, owning and running a
VW
Type 2 in the 21st Century, from purchase guides to lead prospective owners
through the minefield of buying a 20+ year old vehicle, to tips on keeping
them 
running, articles on original and restored examples of all ages and types, 
different camping conversions, practical upgrades, accessories, even ideas 
on places to visit...

The VW Camper is often seen as a vehicle for the young, and many magazines
only concentrate on appealing to them with modified vehicles - 'Volkswagen
Camper and Commercial' looks to a wider audience, including the purist to
whom only 100% originality will do, to the average family who simply see the

VW as a cost effective (and more practical) alternative to a £40,000 mobile
home.
Even the older individual who fancies recapturing some of their youth when
they
owned a VW in the '60s or '70s... full circle! A van for all people, with
now a
magazine to match.

Volkswagen Camper and Commercial will start life as a quarterly magazine
with the first issue going on sale the 15th December 2000. It will only be
available
to purchase by subscription, certain retail outlets or via the internet:
