Subject: Starter woes - fixed

Just an FYI, I finally replaced my starter again (this time AutoZone gave
me a rebuilt VW). This one works perfectly first time, every time. I
didn't even realize how bad the other starters were (figured it was a
problem elsewhere in the system).

I also realized that my alternator was bad since my CD player started
working again after the new one was installed. All the tin is back on and
everything is running great.

BTW, I still didn't replace the starter bushing - I have no idea how to
coax the old one out. Any hints?

-Eric
