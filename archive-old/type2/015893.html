&gt;If you look at a &quot;Engine Oil Viscosity Specification&quot; chart and compare temp 
&gt;ranges, you will see 20/50 craps out at 80º. There is one on page 5 of 
&gt;section 9 of the 68-79 Bentley. Also in bus owners manuals. Bob in Texas 
&gt;talked of driving in 110 degree temps. Here in Fresno, Calif., the summers 
&gt;usually have 30 to 40 days with temps 100-110. The temp range for 40 weight 
&gt;is 68 to over 100º [the chart stops at 40c/103f]. Even a Mercedes owners 
&gt;manual [85] says &quot;SAE 40 may be used if ambient temeratures constantly 
&gt;exceed +30ºC/+86ºF&quot;.

That's very interesting.  My only problem with 40wt is that I've never seen
it in a synthetic (and I'm sold on synthetics).  I wonder if synthetic
20/50 craps out at 80 degrees also?  I sure hope not.  Anyone know?
Regardless, if I could find Mobil-1 40wt I would certainly give it a try in
the summer months.
