Mmmm, well,well,well...so you've caught the dual cab
disease, have you.
I saw that early pic of Kimm Garland's now GM
supercharged V6 powered 71 DC on your site.
Ever been for a ride in it?
It's a WEAPON!!
I prefer single cabs myself.
You're in Sydney are you?
Boris's Picnic Day is on at Milperra Motor Boat Club
this Sunday.
It starts at 9am.
Mail me if you'd like more details &amp; maybe we can get
together for a few beers and a yarn or two.
I've also been interested in starting up a fairly
informal bus club, without the politics &amp; just to
enjoy driving and working on our buses.
Wotcha reckon?
:-)
Cheers
