Subject: Oil Flow Questions

Hi,

I'm reinstalling my 1600 engine today. It's 70(F) degrees here in
upstate New York. Happy June-uary.

I erroneously did not label the oil lines to my external oil filter
and cooler so I have two pertinent questions.

1) Which oil passage on the engine block does oil flow out of, the one
toward the front of the vehicle or the rear?

2) Which direction is oil supposed to flow through an oil filter? Does
oil enter or leave through the center of the filter?

Thanks!

peace
