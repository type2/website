Hello,

i'll throw in a guess....  i bet its the switch for the rear dome lite.
If the wires are thin and the swtich is located jut to the right of the
steering column, between the windshield wiper switch and the column, thats
probably what it is.

&gt; &gt; Hi list,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have been removing some of  the dash wiring today in anticipation of
&gt; &gt; replacing the front panel and came across something that strikes me as a
&gt; &gt; bit odd. There are three different switches upfront. The light switch, the
&gt; &gt; hazard light switch and a third. This one has never worked and so I don't
&gt; &gt; know what it did. Today I found it has only two wires, a live red which
&gt; &gt; goes to the fusebox and a brown, that later becomes blue with red spots.
&gt; &gt; This second wire goes up the side of the windscreen and then down towards
&gt; &gt; the back of the bus. The PO though  must have thought it was useless as
&gt; &gt; they cut it. What is it? Where does it go? It is a 73 westy, British
&gt; &gt; registered. Any ideas?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks
