Subject: Re: bad heater pipe

Hi,

Today I went to Home Depot to get the PVC pipe to fix the heater pipe under 
the bus and walked by
the HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) ducts and figured out 
that they were a good option.
The 3&quot; duct fits around the heater pipe and comes unfolded, making it easy 
to install it over the pipe without
having to remove it all or use rubber couplings. I put some pictures on the 
web of the repair:
http://home_dot_comcast_dot_net/~rpalomera/VW/heater_pictures.html

Total cost for the repair came around $10 with a tube of HVAC caulk to seal 
the ends of the duct over the pipe.
Since I was repairing the pipe I thought about installing the in-line 
booster fan, but since H.D. didn't have one
and given the simplicity of the repair I left that for another occasion...

Happy busing.
