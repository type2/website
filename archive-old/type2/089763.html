Hello All    Well let me tell you guys what I did with the Ghoost 66 westy,  
I put a lock on the engine compartment cover. So remove the rotor button and 
then lock the hatch. It also gives me a place to put things and lock them up 
like cameras, tape players , tools, etc. old buses are way to easy to break 
into.  Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service  salem va
