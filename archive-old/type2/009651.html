I recall the reason for specific oil viscosities was that the oil also acts
as the cooling system and the oil pressure relief valve was two stage. If
the oil is too thick when it's warm then not enough flows through the oil
cooler. The engine gets too hot and the oil breaks down. I used straight 30
winter and summer back in my beetle days. Use 10w30 now in the Westie and
HD20 for the winter.

| ambient temp limit of 80F on 20W-50. Your current name-brand oil is
| API service SJ, much tougher stuff in the opinion of the oil companies,
| VW and most other automakers. But if you want a book to refer to, don't
run 
| 20W-50 when its more than 80F outside.

| 	If you think oil technology has improved enough in the last 
| 21 years, you might consider 20W-50. My water-cooled Corrado runs oil
| temps around 235-240 on a hot day and a long cruise. For the Corrado's
| VR6, VW requires API service rating SF or SG, 15W-40, 15W-50, 20W-40 or 
| 20W-50 for ambient temps of 104F/40C and above.
