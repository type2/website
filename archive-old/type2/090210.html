Subject: Re: [T2] quick horn button ?

&gt; Sorry, this has been covered before, but can't find it
&gt; in the archives.
&gt; '68 horn works only rarely. Seems to be button.
&gt; How do I get it off? Pry under the edge of black
&gt; button or the silver ring?
&gt; TNx for any help. Email directly if it saves bandwidth.

Carefully pry just the black cap off.
Use like a thin knife blade and work around between the cap and the silver
ring. careful the cap may be brittle. Also it can be stubborn. there is a
metal ring in there around the lower perimeter of the cap which snaps it
in place and it can be a bit of a bugger.
