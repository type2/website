Subject: Seals....not the swimming kind
To: Type2_at_type2_dot_com

Greetings to the List........

I'm in the middle of putting together my 70 Bus.  Right now my attention is 
focused on the rear bumper.  I've got most of the parts for a nice OEM kinda 
restoration but I am missing the rubber seals which run along the outside of 
the bumper splash pans.  I know somebody (probably a bunch of somebodies) on 
the List has had to have run into this problem before.  Where can I find 
these seals?
