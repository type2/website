Ok List I'm stumped and I hope one of you can help. Got the 74 Bus back
from the Mech who told me it needed a new Alternator. So I charged up my
battery and drove it home. Today I pulled the Alternator and as i was
getting ready to pull the wire to the starter I saw that it wasnt
connected! Since I had the alt. off I took it and had it tested. Tested ok.
Put it back in but the volt meter still only reads 11 or 12 and goes down
with the lights on. Also realized everytime I step on the brakes the light
comes on.  Hmmmmm any ideas?

Ps does anyone with a 74 westy know where the city water comes in?
