Subject: timing mark!

I have looked at the stuff on line, read the books and can not find a timing mark on the pulley of my 72.
  I am struggling here to get my svda installed and everything like it should be.
   
  I finally, after lots of bad words, got the dizzy down in the case and engaged.  it is waaayyy off from where the 009 was.
  Should I be concerned?
   
  Any advice on this procedure.
  I am pulling the few hairs I have left out!!!
