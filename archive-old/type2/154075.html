Subject: Re: [T2] stinger S2402 multi-battery isolator

----- Original Message ----- 
From: &quot;dan radom&quot; 


&gt;A friend of mine has one of these he isn't using ( 3 post 95amp model).  
&gt; Is it as simple as attaching the alt to the middle post and the 
&gt; batteries to the A and B posts and then rewriting my radio, interior 
&gt; lights, and 12v power outlets to one battery and leave the rest on the 
&gt; other?  Does anyone have any experience with this product or other 
&gt; multi-battery isolators?  


Dan,,, here is a link to a page I wrote about that topic.

I personally prefer the relay over the diode style isolator...
