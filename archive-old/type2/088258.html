My 71 Westy, new to me is getting around 10 mpg.
All the other buses have had (4) did 20 or better.
It has just been tune &amp; runs strong the thing that comes to mind is that =
it has the .09 distributor but could it be that bad. =20

The old suburban I drove did better than this.

Hope you can help.

Thank you,

Chris=20
