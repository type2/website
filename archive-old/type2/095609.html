Subject: RE: [T2] Seat covers question

&gt; Thinking about restoring my front seats in the 75 bus. Found what looks
&gt; to be an excellent price at Bus Depot on part number 432115. Can anyone
&gt; tell me their experience with this product? I have always gotten good
&gt; stuff from them but this price seems a bit too good compared to other
&gt; vendors so I thought I'd check the lists' opinion


It's made by TMI, as is the VW upholstery sold pretty virtually everywhere
else, given that they are by far the largest VW upholstery supplier. The
only difference is the price.  TMI's quality is generally good, although
their delivery can be a bit slow unless they happen to have one on the shelf
when you order.  (Like most vendors, we have them dropship the upholstery
directly to you when you order it; allow a few weeks if they have to make it
to order.)
