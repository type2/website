I agree and I don't think this is the place to &quot;vent&quot; stuff like that...we've all had much worse...suck it up and keep it to yourself!  It doesn't help us and we can't help you with it.
Sorry for the lack of bus content..I'm just sick of this being a place for b*tching and &quot;commenting&quot; and not for actual help.  Don't forget over a thousand people all over the world get your message.


&gt;umm WOW michael can i suggest some herbal tea...LOL&gt;. sorry for your loss or frustration or agrivation....
goood luck...
peace
chris

the parts came in that I needed to continue the rebuild on a friends bus. 
New Pistons and Cyllinders

minute the box looks all f%#$*&amp; up. Open it up and find every single 
cyllinder has some busted fins on them. GD it, MF it, ............where's my
