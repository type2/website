Subject: Are Gas and Diesel tanks similar?

My 82 Westfalia has suffered severe gas tank rusting, to the point where it looks
unusable. Does anyone know if a similar year Diesel tank is the same shape and
configuration?
A local junk yard has a diesel tank in a T-boned 82 that is available.
Thanks from London - Dave H.
