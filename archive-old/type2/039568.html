Hi list

I have been on this list for months now. Its the best I’ve seen!
I recently bought a 78 westy for a good deal. Until today, It was
starting but would die after a few second. While I was investigating the
wires here and there on the bus, getting familiar with the EFI, I must
have done somthing wrong... but what?
Now nothing but the lights are coming on. I can also hear the fuel pump.
But nothing coming from the engine...?

Any ideas where to look first?

I have also something else I can’t figure out. On The control unit
cable, Out of the 3 first wires coming out of there, 2 are not connected
to anything. They are the same lengh with small plastic connectors. By
looking at page 213 of the Haynes manual, they should go to the
injectors, but not mines.. The injectors are already hooked up and the
connectors are smaller anyway.

Any ideas?

Thanks!
