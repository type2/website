Subject: New Crazy Rays in Baltimore MD

Yesterday, the NEW  Crazy Rays opened (Curtis Bay, exit 1 (south) off 695 .5 
miles, turn East .2 miles and on the left....).  Now there are three Crazy 
Rays in the Baltimore area.

For air cooled VW people, forget about the new yard!!  There are no Vanagons 
or buses, and the 4-5 AC VWs that are there are in a special fenced off 
holding pen with the antique and specialty cars

All the other cars are NOT fresh meat; they have been picked over.

Unless you are looking for some non-bus tires (Marcus??), don't bother with 
the NEW Crazy Rays....
