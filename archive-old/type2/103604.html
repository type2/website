&gt; Hey List,
&gt;
&gt; The other day someone posted pictures of a bus they had just bought.  In
&gt; one of the pics was the spare tire in it's well, in the back of the bus,
&gt; with a nifty looking hard plastic cover for it.
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone know where one of these hard covers can be purchased?

You mean the one with the VW emblem in the middle?  Those came stock with
the bus!  I don't know of anyone repopping them.  Watch the wrecking
yards.  Perhaps Busted Bus might be able to help you?
