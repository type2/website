Hemp's probably still illegal because the hippies are so into the hemp-thing, and love to go around sporting &quot;help gear&quot; decorated with &quot;420&quot; images.  I've even seen the word &quot;hemp&quot; and a marijuana leaf on the same garment - if that isn't shooting the hemp movement in the foot, what is?  Most people probably didn't know what help was until they saw some wannabe smelly hippie kid with dredlocks and reeking of that pitchuli (sp) oil crap with one of those shirts.   It's an easy, harmless political issue for the kiddies to latch their soft little minds onto, and I'm sure a lot of them have dreams of growning their own hemp in their backyards when/if it's legalized.

The only &quot;advantage&quot; of hemp seat covers is the bragging rights to tell all your pictuli-oiled friends that you have hemp seat covers, while you're sitting around banging disrythmically on your bong (oops, &quot;bongo&quot;) drums late into the night while everyone else at the show is trying to sleep.

One thing I read said that it was originally made illegal as a protectionist move by the cotton farmers, but I have nothing to confirm or deny that statement.

Hemp may be the strongest natural fiber on earth, the cure to anything that ails this little blue planet, but until the trendy slacker wannabe hippie kids shift their attention to something else, it will continue to be cast in a bad light.  Maybe they should turn to plutonium or something, and get it banned.  (BTW, I hear plutonium gives you a great high!  No really! My cousin's mom's ex-boyfriend's sister's mechanic who used to follow the grateful dead in a Ford Econoline and worked at Oak Ridge Lab told her)

So what if it (hemp) *was* legalized?  Immediately large commerical hemp farms would spring up, and it would be a commodity like cotton and soybeans.  Maybe then the hipsters could trade hemp futures - &quot;yeah, dude, I just made a fortune in the hemp market, and now I got the munchies, dude, duuuude, dude.&quot;  

But legalizing it would take all of the fun out of it.  If it was legal, having a shirt with &quot;hemp&quot; on it would be as exciting as a &quot;Milk&quot; t-shirt.    

BTW, I'm not anti-hippie, as long as one realizes the fact that no real hippie was born in the wild since ~1960 or so.  The rest are &quot;MTV hippies,&quot; born in captivity were spoon fed their hippiness from bad movies, TV, and grateful dead album covers, and use the hippie schtick as an excuse for their chemical indulgences and abhorrence of bathing.   It's like the difference between a panda in the wild in China, and a stuffed panda you get at the state fair.

Buses existed before hippies, and they'll exist after the last hippie has faded into the acid-enhanced sunset; I just hope I live that long...
