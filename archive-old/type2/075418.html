Jim is right!  Do be careful to look at the model year on the page, tho,
not the label in the index.  For example, the diagram labelled &quot;1969-1970&quot;
on the page is for 1970 model year buses, which were manufactured from
August of 1969 thru august of 1970.  Go by your VIN to find the right
diagram!
