&gt; The self-drilled plate positions the sender outside of the main crankcase
&gt; in a slightly more sheltered area, and closer to the outside of the engine

The 914 plate came with a cover to keep the sender from being cooled by the
passing airflow in addition to cradling the sender.

&gt; It also makes a difference what engine case code you have as to how the
&gt; gauge/sender works, the 914 engine case and the early bus TIV cases are
&gt; different than the late cases in the sump plate well area. If you use a sump
&gt; plate sender in a hydraulic case it will read very slowly because the sump
&gt; plate well area is almost completely isolated from the main volume of the
&gt; sump.

This is still a mystery to me. I only keep mentioning this because I think
people should inspect their cases rather than conclude it won't work just
going by the engine number. I have a GE case and the case is opened up right
where it needs to in order to get a better oil temperature reading:

Perhaps it's the 79 GE cases starting with engine #039333 that lack the
opening but mine is a factory case that's never been split.

Who knows, so for those interested, next time you change your oil, drop the
sump plate and inspect that area of the case to see if it's worthwhile
installing the sender. Having said that thermistors (like the VDO
temperature senders) are notoriously slow to respond to temperature
increases. This is something that thermocouples do easily but nobody I can
locate has a M14x1.5 sender and matching gauge.

I've been toying with the idea of drilling out the VDO sender and epoxying a
themocouple inside that responds quickly to oil temp changes just for fun. R
the oil temp is that important to me while I drive but it would be
interesting to try out.

I don't think that installing the sender in that location is as useful as
what Hoover suggests which is to tap the case at the oil gallery plug right
before the pump. Here's a Type 1 example:

&gt;It will still work at full operating temp and be useful, it will just
&gt; take a very long time to reach temperature.

This is party due to the thermistor behavior. The 914 senders (VDO) were so
precise there were no numbers on the factory VDO temp gauge...
