Subject: Re: [T2] Shift Pattern Drawing

Hi Rogelio,

It's a common sight that the shift pattern has faded away.

However, someone made a photoshopT document of it (.psd document)

If you use transparent sticker foil in your printer and print it onto that
you can re-apply it to the ashtray.

The page is in Dutch language but i have given the translation already here.

The direct link to the .psd document containing the shift pattern is here.

Good luck with the printing!!

Subject: [T2] Shift Pattern Drawing


&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone has the shifter pattern drawing that goes on
&gt; the ashtray of the bus. After 34 years, mine faded away,
&gt; and I thought that I could draw it and print a stencil to
&gt; paint it on the ashtray.
&gt;
&gt; I know there is a decal out there, but I'll probably end
&gt; up paying more for shipping than for the decal.
