&gt;Also, I hate the curtain rod system and am thinking about making a velcro

Try the rare earth magnets the size of watch batteries.  Just sew
them into the edges of the curtains.  This holds all sides of the
curtains against the window, which keeps the light out far better
than the stock set-up.  The curtains can be stowed away when
not in use, so as not to block your view when driving.  There won't
even be any velcro strips stuck all around your windows!
