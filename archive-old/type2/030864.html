I'm looking for an auto tranny, BUT I have heard that the vanagons have a

lying around than older vans.

my shift linkage is on the passenger side, I have heard it is on the
drivers side of the vanagon tranny???  also the accelerator linkage is
linked to the tranny too

&gt; would love to throw in another engine and tranny (read
&gt; more power) in the near future. I'm thinking '78&gt;

&gt; top of engine was burned, FI and all plastic
&gt; components were garbage. Would this fit in a '73? Is
