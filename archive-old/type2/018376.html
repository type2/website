well, ive got my bus running, barely. it only started when i poured gas
down the carboraters. it backfires alot (only when starting). it ran
smoothly only with the gas pedle half way down. i think the timeing is
off (as it just had new points) and the carbs need to be ajusted. i have
the bently manual but i thought id ask for opinions here. there's some
pictures below, no new one's though, hopefully more to come too.
