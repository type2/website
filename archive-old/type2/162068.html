Hi Neal 

If you look around in the right side hatch hinge area.. you might find a 
wire or 2,, the wire resembles mig welding wire... it is painted. It may be 
held in place at the very back with a gob of putty or seam sealer like 
material. 

That wire runs from the rear hatch hinge area... to the glove box area. 

You can use it as a fish wire to attach speaker wire to... and pull it thru 
the body.... 

I have seen it in many buses .. maybe it is in yours.
