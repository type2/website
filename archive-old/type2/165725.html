It sounds like an original seat finally dropped.

Are these AVP heads you recently had rebuilt or AVP rebuilt heads  
from 3K miles ago?

The budget rebuilders aren't in the habit of replacing the seats:  
they just replace the exhaust valves, regrind the seats with stones  
and ship them out.

&gt; There could have been issues before I got it, the seats may have  
&gt; been pressed with inadequate interference fit.

The factory interference fit was probably a compromise between fit  
and mass production. You can get a better fit these days if the  
rebuilder takes the time and charges for it.

With regard to peening: you can't know if this process has induced  
cracks or if the stress from the compacted metal will create one later.

&gt; I do not drive the Van hard, 60-65 on flat highway, no wind, is  
&gt; fast enough. I had it in second gear going through the Rockies a  
&gt; few times trying to be gentle and humble.

No harm from that.
