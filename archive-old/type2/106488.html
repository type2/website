&gt;the problem with T-4s is they only have a 1.3:1 rocker ratio, so the lift IS

It can vary from 1.58 (stock) to 1.72.  I run 1.6.  But the same rocker ratios are available on VW engines whether or not they are hydraulic - I still don't understand why hydraulics would have limited lift capability vs. solids except in very extreme cases.  I'm not trying to be argumentative here - I just want a good technical explanation of why hydraulics are not suited to moderately aggressive cam profiles on a type IV.  Maybe I should just call WebCam.

&gt; You'll notice with VW hydraulic grinds the available lifts are much
&gt;lower then with solids, because they have to be so much milder on the on/off
&gt;valve seat events with hydraulic lifters, &lt;snip&gt;

Why do they have to be so much milder on/off the seat?  The cam in my Mustang is very aggressive in that respect.  265/275 advertised and 218/228_at_.050&quot; with .520&quot; lift.  Makes 1hp/ci at the rear wheels with hydraulics.  Only difference is that they are rollers, but if the limitation is the hydraulic lifters like you are saying, then that shouldn't matter.  If the limitation is cam wear, I can accept that as I don't consider the type IV  valvetrain to be very robust.  But again, that has nothing to do with hydraulic vs. solids.
