Subject: Re: Speaking of Hubcaps

&gt;Does anyone know where the touring hubcap and associated items are?

Hey there Paul (and Volks),

I beleive that Kelly http://www.metwiz_dot_com/ has it. 

We really need to get that thing to go west, it's been east of the
mississippi for too long (since Oct 1999). I was driver #2 see
http://www.type2_dot_com/~chuff/1999.htm for details. 

I don't think that many vintagebus members have had a turn carrying
the hubcap yet either 8-)

Hopefully after everybus the hubcap will eventually find itself
heading west.

Hubcap trivia: I think that Steve Dolan is the only person to have
had the hubcap in his possession more then once (twice? 3 times??).

Later...
