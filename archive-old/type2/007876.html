I'll bet dimes to dollars that George Lyle can give a better explanation 
that what follows. But here goes.

What you are talking about is adding the angular momentum of the moving 
vehicle to the static weight. Except it doesn't work that way.

The short answer is, weight decreases. That's why eventually a vehicle 
making a screeching turn will go up on two wheels and eventually tip over.

Here's the longer version. What you want to do is to calculate the 
angular momentum of the bus through the turn. That will depend on the 
mass of the bus and the velocity through the turn. But now it gets 
complicated, because that angular  momentum will be for the bus's center 
of gravity. (and you are right that the center of gravity is higher on a 
top-heavy camper).

Now, you need to work out the stress on each tire relative to the center 
of gravity. That's going to be different for each tire, and it's going to 
be a vector relating the angular momentum to weight (where weight it mass 
times force of gravity [g]). This will also depend upon the camber of the 
front wheels, the condition of torsion bars and shocks, the condition 
and composition of the road, accleration through the turn if any, and on 
and on and on. For instance, the tires will tend to skid on a gravel road 
or on a rain-slick surface before weight reaches zero.

But that's the bottom line. At some point, &quot;weight&quot; will be zero.

It would be fun to get George to come up with some numbers and see what 
his best students can come up with.
