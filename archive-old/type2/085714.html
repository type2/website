Subject: mustache bar question

Currently dressing out an engine built in a new 'universal' case.  The lower 
of the three holes for the mustache bar is a different diameter than the 
upper two.  My old case (Mexican) had three holes of the same diameter.  
Does anyone know, or have access, to information regarding the size of the 
lower hole on my new case?  I either need the info or will be buying lots of 
bolts from the hardware store for a trial and error session.

Thanks a bunch.
