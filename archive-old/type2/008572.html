&gt;  I said in the earlier post that the parts amounted to about the same
&gt; weight/size class.  Its primarily a function of distance.  Socal is
farther
&gt; than Bus Depot and that saves money for Midwesten bus fanatics.  As
far as
&gt; time for shippment goes.  SoCal &quot;forgot&quot; to tell me that half of my
order
&gt; was backordered.  It took a mont for my carbs to arrive.  i had to
call
&gt; four times and got vague guesses everytime as to when I would get my
parts.
&gt;  Bus depot told me when to expect my parts (one week)  and they came
six
&gt; days later.  I hope thats enough info for whoever cares.  Anyways
For us
&gt; folks in the MidWest its a good option and owing to their great
costomer
&gt; service, I don't mind plugging the Bust Depot.  8 or 30 bucks...its
your
&gt; choice....shop wisely

I live in SoCal and still favor generally the Bus Depot over my nearer
suppliers.  My orders have been handled quickly, honestly, and
professionally.

Shipping time is a bit hard to judge, since much of the merchandise is
drop-shipped from other locations.

What many suppliers try to do is to low-ball the prices, then make it
up in &quot;shipping and handling&quot;.  J.C. Whitney, the grand-daddy of them
all, is famous for this practice with their &quot;E-Z rate shipping&quot; that
greatly penalized smaller and lighter orders  If I bought a $20 part
from 'ol J.C., they would add a $9.65 shipping fee to it.  Of course,
if you ordered a truly bulky or weighty part then it was &quot;exempt&quot; from
the E-Z rate plan and you had to pay the full cost of shipping!

It's also common practice for a supplier to fail to mention that a
part is out of stock unless they are asked directly.  The theory is
that if they already have your order, then you will leave your
business with them while they order the part from their sources. 
Inventory costs money, and some outfits play the game of ordering from
their wholesalers _after_ your order is in.  I always ask specifically
whether each ordered part is in stock or not.  Occasionally, I have
been lied to and told that parts were in stock, but this only happens
once per company.  Fool me once...

To me, it's worth a few bucks extra to know that the parts I am
ordering will be to me in a reasonable time and will be as described. 
Bus Depot hasn't let me down.
