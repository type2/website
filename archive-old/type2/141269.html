Subject: Re: [T2] Starter trouble

&gt; And I am betting 1 good virtual 6 pack of german beer that Mike has a
normal &quot;un-sealed&quot; lead acid battery in his bus.  In which case, his new
expensive battery cables will benefit from the 99 cent corrosion inhibitors.

Yep, Dave's right.  I haven't quite gotten to the point where I can afford
the neato batteries.
