Hi Ken,

This applied to a Vanagon, but since the early vanagons were A/C, I'm going
to put it out there.  Might also apply to a loaf:

I just had to change out a shaft in my '87 that ran from the steering box to
the rack and pinion. One of the universal joints had began to rust and get a
hard spot.  Penetrating oil helped for a while,  long enough to get a
replacement shaft located.  I don't know if you are talking about a loaf or
a vanagon, but either one has u-joints that might go bad.  I also found that
the shafts on vanagons are different lengths from '87 to '90.  This didn't
pose a problem, as the u-joint comes off of the shaft.  Just an idea that
might help.
Mark
