&gt;&gt; I'm using Michlin 185-R 14&quot; Tires, sidewall also says 91T M7S 
&gt;&gt; which means
&gt;&gt; nothing to me. Max load 1356 LBS Per tire.
&gt;
&gt; It means that they are underspec. for your bus: the load rating
&gt;is not high enough and they are likely to fail prematurely. 

I'm going to interject in these matters in general, FWIW I've owned
more buses than most of you have likely, and more Vanagons, and
a lot of them have come with passenger car tires.  It isn't right, maybe
they are more likely to fail catastrophically, but I've put a lot of miles
on a lot of these tires.  Some have failed catastrophically, Sears
Roadhandler SCR's by Michelin come to mind.  Other are as solid
50k on as 6 ply raters (some of the Dunlop SP5s? come to mind.)

In general I always replace with a proper tire, the best deal now
days being the reinforced Conti CR21 for $47 each from Tire Rack,
though at this moment backordered.  Correct reinforced tire and
a nice M+S tread.  I've had the Yoko 356, and the Bridestone 603/4
and as all are highway rib treads I don't like them myself, they are
quiet, but the Yoko's particularly I though were a bit squirlish wet
and useless in the snow.

Another thing to note is some tires are sufficient load (a 95 marking)
but aren't &quot;reinforced&quot; per say as no-one in the US cares.  If it is
above 1450 or so and has a 40psi or better inflation you can probably
consider it perfectly safe.

That all said when I have a tire fail I tend not to do stupid things and
tend not to roll my vans, I also check tires visually frequently regardless
of their load ratings.  It's your life, and the life of your kids, and of
bystanders folks, you make the decisions.  However personally if
I had the choice between a worn out set of XZX's and a new set of
some passenger tire that has a 40psi inflation rating I'd take the latter.
This list tends to make people forget that as a rule I'd put money on
the fact that over 80% of the '68-'88 or so transporters on the road
out there today are running on passenger car rubber.  Very few owners
beyond the first even know that is incorrect, and a lot who do know
don't take the time, effort, and expense to track down proper stuff when
they need to.  Like I said, the CR21 is a heck of a deal though so I
can't imagine if you need NEW tires why you'd use anything else.
You can get it to your door and installed locally for less than what any
local fool is going to charge you for whatever.

It also goes to say in your local searches 195/75R14 or 205/70R14
are close enough sizes.
