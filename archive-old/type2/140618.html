Subject: Autocad Drawings of Westy Panels

Hello,  Some time ago a member was producing autocad drawing of his Westy's
interior panels and headliner.  The site he posted these seems to be no
longer around.  Does anyone have these in their archive and can direct me to
a source of these drawings?  I am particularly interested in the headliner
as I am converting my non-Westy vinyl one to a birch one.
