I work for a company that is under contract to store spent nuclear fuel.  
Sorry to any the anti nukes out there!  But the job allows me to spend money 
on my two VW's, 1973 Campmobile and 1973 Beetle.  Currently working on the 
beetle replacing transmission and repairing heads.  Camper is a project car 
for my 15 year old son, plan to start on camper this fall.  I have enjoyed 
this link, if any of you are in the Augusta area please p-mail me.

Paul, Augusta Ga.
1973 Camper
1973 Beetle
1987 Renault Alliance Covertable
1998 Daihatsu Carade
1992 Mercury Sable
To many cars, but like them all and can't decide what to get rid of !!!
