Subject: Sliding door inside handle 70-72 swapable?

Hey list!

Are all 68-79 Cargo door inside handles the same (interchangeable)?
My '72 Westy came without one (not even sure if the inside lock
mechanism works)
Bus Boys has 1 for $35, Wolfsburgs is $40, and I don't see 1 at PartsVW.

But I may have found 1 from a '70 and want to make sure it'll fit first.

Thanks

-PM
'72 Westy
