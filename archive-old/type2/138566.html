Subject: RE: [T2] AFM core value

I'm more of a type 1 engine guy but last I checked AFMs are very $$$$$$$ and 
require a core which just adds to the $$$$$$$$$.

Keep it incase you need to ever order an AFM or sell to someone as a known 
core. I tend to not throw ANY part away that has any value to anyone.

&gt;does a used AFM that doesn't test to spec have any value, is it repairable,
&gt;is there core value, is it all out trash?
