Subject: Re: [T2] choking fuel injected  Westy

Standard problem, standard fix...

Remove the temp sensor II located on top of the #3 cylinder head.  You
won't need tolls 'cause it's already loose.  Clean up the threads and
put it back in.  Snug it up with a wrench (14mm I think) and all will
be well.

&gt; Hi everyone-
&gt;  my bus started to kind of choke now and then.
&gt; It seemed exactly like it wouldn't fire for a second, and then pick up and
&gt; keep on going... As I drove it started to get worse and that's about the
&gt; time I pulled over and slept for the night...Anyhow, the next morning it
&gt; wouldn't start--seems very much like it's not getting gas. t
