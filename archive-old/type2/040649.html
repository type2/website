Pull over and towed it home.  Bus starts right up, loud clacking seems to
come from right head.  All valves seem loose (stock hydraulic) except one
on the left head.  Pulled all plugs and compression test is 110 in all
except #4 which is 90 (left, rear cylinder).  With the plugs out cranking
the motor for compression test sounds just fine--clacking gone.  Going to
clean plugs and see if it was a collapsed lifter.

Had same thing happen on 78 loaf we used to have. Took off the valve cover 
and futzed around with the pushrod ends only-didn't really do anything. 
Sound went away for 40 miles, when it reappeared at start of NC trip the 
next day. Futzed in the same manner on the roadside, sound went away for 
ensuing 20K. Grandson-in-law has put an additional 30K or so on it with no 
problems. Hope your's too is just a stubborn lifter :)
