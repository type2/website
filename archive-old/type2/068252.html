Subject: Jalousie Window Cranks

Hi Y'all,
  I also noticed that the window cranks for the Jalousie windows switched
sides between '69 and '71.  They are to the left on the '69 so I am gonna
swap the passenger side windows where the cranks will both be toward the
front of the '71.  (Vacation Westy)  So someone with a '70 Westy;  Which
side are the Jalousie (louvered) window cranks on?
