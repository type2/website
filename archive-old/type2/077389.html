Subject: RE: Yukon's great &quot;I (nearly) don't know diddley&quot; '69 sunroof project

&gt;Could the 1600 upright engine in this bus have been transplanted 
&gt;from a Porsche 914 like the seller implied?  It strikes me that 
&gt;914s all had the Type IV.

Not a chance that it's from a 914.  All 914-4's had type IV motors.  70-72 were 
1.7 only, 73-74 were either 1.7 or 2.0 and 75-76 were either 1.8 or 2.0.  All 
Bosch d-jet fuel injected.  This includes the European cars as well.

It could, however, be a 356 motor or a 912 motor (not the 76 912 as these used 
the Porsche version of the type IV 2.0).  They'll bolt right up and run.  These 
356/912 motors are becoming very scarce and, subsequently valuable to Porsche 
owners.  They've got more HP than the buses and bugs, but I don't know the 
specs.  Nor do I have any engine codes since I don't do 356's or 912's, but you 
could probably check to see if the engine codes match those for bugs or buses.
