Subject: RE: [T2] Aftermarket parts

&gt; To a bus owner, a part is a part. A bolt is a part. Unless the 
&gt; marketplace has been swept clean of them, there are still a lot of 
&gt; counterfeit bolts (I think they came from China) that shear when you 
&gt; look at them.


Okay, you've got me there. I was thinking in terms of VW-specific parts,
as opposed to generic hardware that fits lots of makes. We don't do much
in the way of generic hardware (other than a selection of metric
fasteners etc. that we buy from a well-regarded import supply house), so
that goes beyond my area of expertise.
