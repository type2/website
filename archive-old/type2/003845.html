Subject: Temp Sensor Copper Washer

Excuse this silly question, but does the copper washer for the Oil Temp =
sensor go on the inside with the nut (and sensor) or does it go on the =
outside with the wire terminal?

Gonna try and put some RTV silicone on as suggested in earlier posts. =
It's the Permatex, Sensor Safe, Ultra Blue, RTV silicone.  Never as easy =
as just walking into store and buying RTV, hope this is the right =
variation.

Anyone have pictures posted of their gauge sensor installations =
(especially the oil pressure sensor)?

Thanks,
