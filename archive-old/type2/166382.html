Subject: 1971 Type 2 Engine Recommendations

Although I know the risk of being laughed at and I know this question
will probably lead to the someone saying, &quot;Opinions are like
A$$^*!#$...everyone has one&quot;... my question is...

Which is better... Rebuild your engine, buy a longblock, or buy a
turnkey?

I own a 1971 VW Westy that I bought off a guy for storage fees.  The
Westy was put into towed into a storage lot after stopping to run on the
Interstate.  All cylinders have little compression but I actually got
the engine to run after doing a valve job and priming the carb with a
little petrol.

I have never a rebuilt a engine (VW or otherwise) but do belong to local
VW club and have some knowledgeable friends.  I am, however, fairly
mechanically inclined and am not afraid of doing the standard
maintenance, valve job, rebuilding a carb, replacing the odd part, and
doing the occasional body work (panels, patch, and paint).

I own several other VWs...1972 Beetle, 1976 VW Transporter, 1961 VW Dune
Buggy, etc...

Time is the one thing that I have not had, recently, and that (along
with funds for other projects) has led me to the crossroad.  There are
so many vendors and options out there I would like to hear some feedback
from y'all with a good bit more experience than I.

Thanks,

Michael Martin
