Having recently parted out a Bus (salvaging the gas tank) I would have to
say that the easiest way to replace the hoses are with the engine out and
the access plate removed.  Your problem may, in fact, be a leaking vent hose
rather than the filler hose.  The filler hose is best tackled by removing
the tank.  Then you can slip the new one on as you put the tank back in
place.  By the way, once you think you have all the screws off of the access
plate (and still can't force it off), look underneath as there are more
screws facing the ground.

&gt; 
&gt; Im now thinking about the days off I have coming up, and figure I may as 
&gt; well attack this myself. But, what is involved in this?
&gt; My Haynes doesn't really give any details on this area of the bus, and
&gt; what 
&gt; im getting myself into. When I take the gas cap off, I can see those 4 
&gt; screws that hold the neck in place, but im curious how this fits over the 
&gt; rest of the fuel neck thingy. Am I going to have to get into this area 
&gt; another way, or can I just pull it off from the outside of the bus and
&gt; slip 
&gt; the new one over it?
&gt; 
&gt; I see that little circle thing behind the airbox, and im guessing that is 
&gt; some kind of access to that area, but I dont want to go pulling anything
&gt; out 
&gt; of there until I know for sure how big of a hole im digging here.
