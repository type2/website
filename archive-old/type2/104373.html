&gt;      So today I finally get the old Bentley out again, and start testing
&gt; componets one-by-one. It appears that the temperature sensor in the air
&gt; flow meter is dead. It reads no resistance at any temperature. All other
&gt; Fuel Injection componets test out okay.

Sure sounds like when my AFM went south.

&gt;      My two questions are as follows. Would such a failure cause my
&gt; symptoms? 

I believe so.

&gt; Second, if it's agreed that this is the cause, I've done some
&gt; searching about replacement units. Most places sell a remanufactured
&gt; unit for around $150, including my local FLAPS (which is a &quot;Beck&quot; world
&gt; part. Busdepot also sells them for this price. Considering a new one is
&gt; $300, and the original lasted 25 years, I'm willing to pay the extra
&gt; cash to have peace of mind. But does anybody have any experience with
&gt; the rebuilts? Are they just a good?

I bought a rebuild one from BD about 1/2 year ago. It didn't fix my
problems, actually made them much worse. BUT...after talking to BD &amp;
then directly with their vendor it turns out I got a small batch of
AFM's that they said were calibrated on a bad test bench. I got
another a few days later &amp; all the problems were gone.

Where in TN are you?
