Hi,

 David Writes:
&gt; I have noticed my engine seems to be running hot.  It is a 68 campmobile
&gt; with a 1600 in it.  I have recently switched out the vaccume advance for a
&gt; 009 distributor, and had the timing adjusted correctly and the engine seems
&gt; to be running smooth, except for climbing hills.

 I don't know about the hot running but I think your &quot;power loss&quot; is because of your distributor. The 009 won't give you any advance at low revs, because it doesn't have the vacuum can that advances the ignition when you have the throttle open at low engine speeds. Hence when you climb a hill the revs drop, the ignition retards, you lose power and have to downshift.
 This is theory, as I havn't done this myself, but the concensus that I have drawn from the list is that the 009 isn't the best choice for a bus for precisely this reason.

 Try putting the stock distributor back on and see if it fixes the torque problem. It might fix the overheating, too.

Cheers,
         W.
