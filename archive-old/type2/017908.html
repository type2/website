I agree with what is wrote below 100%, and much more eloquent than my 
particular ranting on the subject

&gt;I find this (suggesting we not allow customer complaints) scary, frankly. I 
read this list to get information. If there is a business
&gt;I'm thinking of ordering from, I'd like to know of the problems customers 
have had. I would think that would be a *function* of
&gt;this list, not something to be discouraged. Yes, this list reaches lots of 
people, which is why it's so important to share this information. 
&gt;It isn't as if Ron Salmon has no defense. He posted tonight about the 
complications he was having, and I was glad to hear his
&gt;side of the story. I believe him to be an honest and sincere person, from 
reading his posts. If anything, this is a way for him to be
&gt;aware of the public image Bus Depot develops, and help shape it as time goes 
on. It wouldn't be fair for him to be able to talk
&gt;about the business without other people being able to talk about their 
dealings with it. 
&gt;Finally, the post I have quoted below seems to suggest that by talking about 
problems some have had with Bus Depot that
&gt;people are making personal attacks against Ron Salmon, but this is simply 
not the case. Talking about problems with a company
&gt;does not suggest the owner is bad, it just means there might be some 
problems to look into.

A 'for instance' would be that I work on my car late at night or very early 
in the morning. one of my landlords sticks his head out the 
window and says 'Your being ever so blanking quiet in the loudest possible 
way!&quot;  and slams the window shut. Okay, point taken. A week 
later, the other landlord's got a troop of screaming 4 year olds galloping 
across the ceiling and my wife has a horrible head ache. I phone him 
up and say 'so, how bout that noise?' 'he says, &quot;noise? what noise, there is 
no noise, I am enjoying myself with my family! and 
hangs up.'    

Now you see the first landlord transcended our specific relationship of 
money-giver, money-taker, to our greater relationship of
two humans sharing space in the same part of the world, to say &quot;shut up&quot; and 
I have no problem with that. I didn't stop, but...
 the other landlord cannot take any complaints because he owns the land. He 
goes to the other landlord and says 'how dare he complain to me
about noise?!!!?!'    He also believes he owns the street, but that's another 
story. You see the point is, we don't all have to become
incontinent over this issue. It's local, its normal, and we all should 
welcome expression over supression.
