 I and a friend dragged a '71 wewst  from a garage where it has sat for 21
years. Mold everywhere, not engine , and the whole lower half rusted away.
Inside was a Bentley manual covering '68 thru '79 ( An older edition). First
one that NEEDS it , gets is, postage paid, ( at least within a week). TBear.
( PS bumpers and side step are Primo) TBear
