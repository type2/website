&gt; I called the number on the website (206.227.7355), and spoke to
&gt; Christopher Goodwin himself. Apparently, Christopher Goodwin Tools has
&gt; not been around for a couple of years. He is now Christopher Goodwin
&gt; Motorsports, and seemed surprised that the website was still up and
&gt; running
I'll bet that has been a real moneymaker for him.  I ordered the fuel line 
clamp also and
never heard from him and doubt I will.
