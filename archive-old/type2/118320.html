Subject: oil pressure sensor

Hi, I recently bought one of those vdo oil pressure sensors that have
two outputs, one for the idiot light and one for a gauge.   There are no
instructions.   One of the outputs is labeled 'BK' and the other 'G' (or
maybe it's '6', my eyes aren't what they used to be).   Anyway, does
anyone know which output is which?  
 
thanks,
