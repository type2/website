does this squareback have a good engine hatch in it?
I'm looking for one, and if you haven't put one in your 72 I would
recommend it!

Thanks!

&gt; The time has come for me to do the right thing and tear our the
&gt; converted 77 FI engine and replace it with a 72 engine. I have been
&gt; looking around for awhile and have found a 72 squareback, smashed up
&gt; with a great engine. So, is engine identical to the 72 engines
inType
&gt; IIs? They are both TypeIV engines, right?
&gt;
&gt; TIA
