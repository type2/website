&gt; So, with all of this running hot and oil cooler talk of late, I have to say, 
&gt; on every one of my long trips so far, my bus runs way hot. I have the gene 
&gt; berg oil temp thingy, and if I try and go over 60 for any period of time, it 
&gt; starts flickering. Now, this is going up and over hills mind you, but its 
&gt; 
&gt; I just don't understand if this is normal, since VW never included an oil 
&gt; temp gauge then wouldn't everyone just using them for normal day to day 
&gt; vacationing be possibly running them way too hot without ever knowing it?

probably why many never got a whole lot of mileage on em.   

&gt; Before I installed the temp gauge warning system everything seemed fine, and 
&gt; now I constantly worry about ruining the motor. I don't want to push my bus 
&gt; any harder, but part of me thinks this can't be right.

the VW had a heck of a margin of error for heat.  and lots of high speed
driving wasn't the norm back then,  also getting a 100,000 miles out of
any car was unusual

&gt; The motor is a type 4, 2l with hydro lifters. It only has 50,000 actual 
&gt; miles on it, not rebuilt and not removed from the bus since it's original 
&gt; installation.

wheeee where'd you find it?  it is still 20+ years old

&gt; Either, I need to just learn to drive slower, or somethings wrong, or there 
&gt; is something I can do to help a somewhat inefficiant system.

drive slower on hot days and enjoy the scenery

&gt; If it is B, I guess maybe the thermostat that open and closes the flaps? 
&gt; Maybe mine isn't cooling itself properly, if that makes any sense.

easy enough to check.  it's in the Bentley
&gt; 
&gt; If it is C, I better get cracking soon. An oil cooler for my motor is around 
&gt; 200 bones, plus getting someone to install it for me.

nah!

BTW - what do you consider hot?

&gt; Im getting married in 22 days now, and have WAY too many things to try and 
&gt; tackle a learning experience right now. That plus we are going to be taking 
&gt; the bus on our honeymoon from San Francisco up to Montana, through Canada, 
&gt; and back down the coast. 3.5 weeks I will be driving Jasper and I would like 
&gt; to do anything I can to keep him chugging along happy.

get a tune up, pack some spare parts and your AIRS list, make sure your
AAA is paid up and enjoy your wedding and new wife

&gt; Any thoughts, suggestions, or tomfoolery is always welcome...

tomfoolery is for you on your wedding night
