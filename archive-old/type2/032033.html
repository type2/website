Hi,

I wrote earlier. I'm the guy with the oil leak, the broken exhaust
manifold stud and various other less notorious problems.

Its a '79 with a type IV engine--manual transmission.

I let some friends borrow my bus for a day or so thinking &quot;what could go
wrong.&quot;  Well let me tell you.  Since none of them are mechanically
inclined i became worried when one of them told me he had been &quot;working on
it&quot;  Anyways that left it not starting parked illegally on my college
campus.  I reconnected the vaccum advance hose and a couple other hoses
that had been disconnected in the midst of their work.  I troubleshot the
starting system and it looked like it was the solenoid.  so i ordered a
new one and after picking it up this morning noticed the relay that has
been installed in the engine compartment for making starting easier.  I
hadn't checked that fuse because i didn't know about.  fuse was blown.
promptly returned the solenoid muttering something to the guy at the
counter about how &quot;i don't think this looks quite right--maybe i'll just
get an original vw part...&quot; so that he would ignore the large sign
proclaiming &quot;NO RETURNS ON ELECTRICAL PARTS&quot;  got my money and replaced
the 15 amp fuse with a 20 amp since thats all i had.  Now to reconnect the
solenoid as i had it ready to pull.  God there's a lot of wires.  Gee i
don't remember where they all go.  I got the wires coming from forward on
right.  However there are five othe wires and two post terminals.  the
wire which runs from the solenoid to the alternator had all its insulation
burnt off and was covered by oil from that oil leak.  This is all made
more exciting since i decided not to disconnect the battery--&quot;I'll just
put on some thin cotton gloves.  I think the correct way to hook up these
wires is the alternator one on the post closest to the starter and the
other four on the post farthest away.  I think this because when i hooked
all five up to the post farthest away--with battery power running--as i
got the screw tight I noticed flames and smoke from the wire leading to
the alternator as the rest of its insulation burnt off.  I swore and
quickly disconnected that wire.  I started the van with alternator
disconnected from solenoid and all four othe wires on post farthest from
starter and drove it the eigth of a mile to a spot where i won't get
monster parking tickets.
	I figure the solenoid to alternator wire was burnt initially
because one of the other wires going to the solenoid might have shorted it
some and when i hooked it up wrong with juice going through it finished
shorting the length of the wire.

SO..A few questions.

1. is the 20 amp fuse gonna be ok in the easy-start relay? And is the
initial shorting of the solenoid to alternator wire what caused the fuse
in the relay to blow?
2. Am i correct in which post of the solenoid i think the alternator is
supposed to bolt to?
3. this burning of the wire which i noticed--did that likely damage the
alternator or am i lucky?
4. is there any other ways this might have got burnt? 
5. should i just rewire it and pretend its OK until the fire trucks are
putting out my bus on the side of the road?
6.what gauge of wire is this?  its hard to tell without insulation on it
and everything blackened.

Thanks for all the help.

P.S. don't worry those friends won't borrow it again soon.

Sorry if any of this is in the archives but the archive server wasn't
