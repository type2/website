Subject: Re: [T2] stripped exhaust header bolt/case threads

its' a type 4 1700 fi
Sorry for the initial confusion of my message.

The holes in the case where the header attaches.
One of the holes has stripped threads, not badly but
getting there.(the stud has nothing to grip, or not much)
I have a leak which I want to fix before
I store it for the winter.
What's the best way of fixing it?
I checked the archive but there was no real info on it that
was helpful.
Should I take it to the VW shop and ask my guru to do it
for me.

Thanks
James
