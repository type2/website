I wanted to ask a question.
I have a 73 Automatic..I want to know if it is possible to convert this to a standard and if it is worth it. Also it sounds like the engine is screaming! when I only am going 55mph. The gas milage is crap and I am not sure what to do at this point. I have changed the modulator and the vacume lines. 
Any suggestions would be great!
Please send to akleinhenz_at_chantest_dot_com

Thanks!
