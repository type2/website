Tom,

&gt;According to Bently and Muir I need to check the inner face of the cam
&gt;gear for pitch radius departure numbers +/- 1,2,3 etc....

As I recall, the number is very small and found on the outer face of the cam
gear. You'll have to get it very clean to find this number, but it's there
somewhere, with the + or - right next to it. You might try looking in the
vicinity of the dots (and try the inside-side of the cam gear as I might be
mistaken).

&gt;Been shoping the net for a new stock cam. (the old one is in bad shape)
&gt;None of the catalogs say anything about ordering the cam with any
&gt;optional gears, just the one that comes with it.

I think you'll find only random values on the cam gears you can buy out
there. If you match the crank gear within one or 2 values, you're doing
great. I think the spec says 3 or 4, but I'd have to look to be certain.

I got my hydraulic cam from Bus Depot, but it was a TRW cam--drop-shipped at
that. I went to a local race shop (where they build cams for top-name
drivers) and had them pull the gear off the old cam and install it on the
new one. They had to use *very* low-profile bolts and tap out threads into
the cam, but it worked fine. I put about 5000 or more miles on the engine
and then parked it pending a fix to an unrelated problem.

FWIW, AVP uses a medium grind cam for both their hydraulic and non-hydraulic
engines. I have one with hydraulics. I'm probably a little underpowered with
this, but for the price, it was worth the trade-offs. The biggest downside
with them is that they use &quot;rebuilt&quot; valves for the hydraulics and I think
these are more prone to failure than good new valves. When I had one go dead
2 or 3 months after getting the engine, they sent me a couple more without
any hassle.

Hope this helps! Joe
