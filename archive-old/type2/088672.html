Followed your procedure, Tim. It went very well, the switch and key are back
in good working order again.

Thank you.

&gt; Put a few drops of light oil in the slot. Oil the key. Then nurse it back
&gt; in and wiggle wiggle wiggle while turning to and fro. If a few minutes of
&gt; this won't free it, the lock cylinder is jammed/broken and must be
replaced.

&gt; &gt;  I was able to get the wrong key removed but the ignition
&gt; &gt;is now in the on position, and the correct key will not go in far enough
to
&gt; &gt;move it's position to off.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;So my questions: 1. Have I ruined a perfectly good, original switch, and
&gt; &gt;need to replace it? 2.  Can I remove the switch and re install it to the
off
&gt; &gt;position, and be ok to use the correct key in it again?
