Subject: Replacing fuel line hints

This is a good time to replace the screen and the discharge elbow, too.

It's a lot more fun if the bus is up in the air some amount so you've got
more head and elbow room down there.

A golf tee works nicely to plug the line if you're not replacing it all, but
next time I'm going to drive the tank nearly dry and then just drain the
rest.  Don't have to be so careful underneath that way.

Take the battery out.  No spark possiblities that way.

Get the correct, metric, rubber tubing.  The American stuff looks close, but
it isn't close enough.  It will work loose in no time.

I used a short piece of rubber tubing, double clamped, as a sort of flex
connection at the elbow out of the tank, then hard piped with steel brake
line in one long piece from there through the firewall and up to the rear
(rear is rear) of the engine compartment.  I split two layers of larger
rubber tubing and clamped them around the hard gas line where it passes
through the firewall.  I wish I'd added one of those metal electrical
grommets you put on electrical panels at the firewall too, but I didn't.
You bend the the brake line slowly and gently with your fingers and/or those
coils that slip over the tube so it doesn't kink.  It's fun to get the shape
right in a PITA sort of way.

I like Bob's idea of a shut off valve, too.  Would be a painless theft
protection of a sort as well.
