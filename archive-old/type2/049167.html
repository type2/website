Subject: [T2] Cab doors - vapor barrier &amp; speaker install

Hi all,
This is my first posting in quite a while.  I've been listening but not had
anything useful to contribute.
I've taken the panels off my cab doors in preparation to install some
speakers.  Does anyone know *exactly* how the vapor barrier sheet is
supposed to go on? (ie as in the factory)  Pictures would be a bonus.  The
original stuff was removed a long time ago by a PO.  Last time I did it I
used double sided tape to stick it on, which worked great, but I couldn't
figure out how it went along the bottom of the doors, with the result that
the rain still gets through.  Someone did tell me that there was a special
&quot;one way&quot; arrangement behind the sliding vents, but I'm not too bothered if
they get covered up.
I'm also debating whether it would be useful to put something
(non-absorbent) in the doors to act as wadding to stop the speakers
sounding boomy.  I couldn't find a definitive answer in the archives.
Would any advantage be outweighed by the reduction in ventilation and
consequent ideal conditions for tinworm?
Keep on keeping on bussing.
