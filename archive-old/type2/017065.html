Andrew:
I've always practiced clutch free driving so I'd be ready when the
clutch cable broke ( and also because it was a challenge to do it well).
Almost all big trucks don't use the clutch between certain gears- just
let off power and shift), so it seemed okay to me to do it . I'd say
about 15-20% of the time I don't. I did change the trans once, because
of a bad pinion bearing, not the synchros. 
The key is to be gentle and careful at matching the two gears' speeds.
When you have a good speed match the gears will engage effortlessly.
