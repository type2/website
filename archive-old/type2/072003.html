&gt;        Actually, performance should decrease. Reason being that higher

This is fascinating.  I have read Mr. Seaver's posts, and so I certainly
respect his knowledge.  So, does this mean that I am &quot;wishful thinking&quot; the
perceived difference in pep when I switch from regular to higher octane?
I'm driving a '79 fuel-injected 2.1 Westy, and in Canada the gasses
involved are Unleaded:  Regular is Octane 89, Premium varies from 92 to 94
(92 sometimes called &quot;mid-grade)  I've noticed better ferformance after a
fill-up with 92, and I almost get speeding tickets when I use the 94.

What &quot;stuff&quot; gets added to unleaded?
