Subject: Re: [T2] hooking computer into baywindow FI

Cool!

Anyone in Kalifornia done this yet???

I'm interested....but need to find out more...started
reading the web-page...

wondering how much more efficient you can be? and
power...sounds cool..am thinking for both the '78
westy...and my '66 mercruiser140-powered '66 Land Rover.
Have been planning on installing chevy throttle-body
injection on that beast instead of the geared webber...

Paul(thinking evil engine thoughts....)

&gt; You just need to switch to Megasquirt.  Dump the original
&gt; ECU
&gt; in the process and plug your laptop right in.  Build it
&gt; yourself and get 
&gt; the source code to boot!


&gt; Two(or more) people have already done it to their
&gt; buses....look here.
