Subject: E-bus, Thanks Chris
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL - S

Hello list,
    I must start by saying thanks to Chris and all who
helped put on this wonderful event. This was my first
big gathering other than Dead shows( which are not as
condensed with busses as this was). I rode down in my
73 sunroof transporter which was running a bit rough
but made it. I met up with Matt Freeman and Judy( cant
remember last name) in Carrboro. From there we
traveled some wonderful roads with amazing scenery.
   At last we made it to the campground and found a
quite spot to make camp. We arrived around noon on
Friday and there were already more than  a dozen
busses. I pitched my tent and went to meet some
wonderful people from all over the east coast. 
  I sat back and watched the busses roll in from all
over and had a wonderful content feeling inside as I
lay there in bliss. I am from Iowa and to see so many
busses and great people in one spot was amazing. 
  Falling asleep to music on Fri. night and waking to
the smells and noises of Sat. morning brought me back
to what makes me happy: Good friends, Good food,  and
VWs. 
 Sat. nights chili feast and  awards ceremony were
fabulously done. They could only be topped off by the
most perfect music imaginable. The bluegrass band was
beyond a wish that anyone could have made to make the
night perfect. The lady that sang was AMAZING!!! Her
voice was haunting in the best way possible.
  Sunday morning was relaxing and time was spent
watching people drive out waving and honking. I met
some great people and made some good friends.
  Chris you should be proud of all the hard work you
did to create this event. I know it will last a long
time and has become, at least for me, &quot;A don't miss.&quot;
I hope to see you all again next year and some of you
earlier than that.
  Jeff.     Hillsborough, NC.
