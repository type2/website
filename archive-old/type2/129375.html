Subject: 1700 HEAD QUESTION

Happy Friday,

I am looking into having a 1700 head fly cut to fit
an 1800 cylinder sleeve. just wondering what the purpose
was of the extra ports beside the intake on top of the heads?
some kind of smog thing? they had these bolt looking thingys
screwed in the ports. and some solid piece that joined both sides. you dual
carb people probably know what i mean.
can these be plugged off? what will that do?

thanks and happy trails.
Darren
