Subject: Re: [T2] cold start injector

PG 215 of Hanes states: Cold srart valve 47: This is
in fact an additional fuel injector which sprays fuel
into the air intake distrubtor when the engine is cold
and the starter is operated. It is controled by the
thermo-time switch.(I stand corrected there is a time
switch) 61: Thermo-time switch- controles on a
decreasing scale, maximum of 11 seconds. If you crank
for over 11 seconds there will be no fuel added to the
start. this is to prevent flooding. Phil
