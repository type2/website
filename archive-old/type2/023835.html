Subject: Defroster, The Rear Window Type

Holiday Greetings to the Esteemed Member of the List

I was following a discussion concerning rear window defrosters over at RAMVA. 
 They were referring to application in Bugs.  But I got to 
wondering..............are new replacement rear windows (with the defroster 
grid) available for the Baywindows which originally sported these items?  I 
think my rear window (a 1970) is too far gone for any of the &quot;touch-up&quot; stuff 
my FLAPS is selling.  
If there are no aftermarket replacements for these rear windows, does anybody 
out there have any other ideas?

As always, Thanks!
