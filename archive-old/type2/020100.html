I agree with this.  I've had syn oil in my '76 westy  for a year (including oil
changes) and it runs smoother, starts easier cold and stays suprisingly clean.
This may be also that I used an engine cleaner before the switch and the PO was
VERY nice to her while he owned her.

&gt; I run 5W-50 synthetic and change the oil at 5k (after break in), I have a
&gt; 2liter which has an oil filter, this keeps the oil much cleaner.
&gt;
&gt; advantages are that it is much easier to start in cold weather, I ski.
&gt; also there is far less where on bearings and moving parts, synthetic
&gt; really does lube better
&gt;
&gt; .  make sure your engine doesn't leak, as mentioned syn is more $$$
&gt; .  it seems to have no effect on cooling, if you run hot you will still
&gt; run hot, in tests there was little or no effect on oil temp
