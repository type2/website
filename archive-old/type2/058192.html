I didn't mean my &quot;Ok, so how come the 091 ...&quot; question to sound snide.
Actually, I really just want to know why I didn't run into any problems,
when I expeced them.  I had heard that the 091 was longer; but didn't
find any evidence of this in the installation (and I didn't have the
original tranny to compare).  I had an extra bellhousing, nosecone,
input shaft, etc, and didn't need any of it.  The tranny went right up
in there, with a minimum of fiddling (I had a couple of different
variations of that little chunk of metal that holds the two fingers of
the nose mount: one with two grooves, and the other without the grooves
and with the holes closer to one side than another, so it can be simply
reversed for more or less room).  But setting aside the reports of
problems just getting it in, if it is longer, shouldn't this require a
shorter shift rod?  Otherwise, the stick shift would angle more
backwards.  I don't believe mine has this problem, however -- or would
this be too slight to be noticeable?
