Subject: ign switch continued

Ok I was able to remove the electrical portion on the switch without
removing the steering wheel etc. That looks hard especially as I have no
puller. Anyway, the switch seems fine. I can start the bus just fine (no
jugging) with a screwdriver in the electrical switch. Does this mean any
thing, or does the consensus continue to be that this is the bad part.

The Bentley is less than helpful.

Since I already had a key mechanism on hand (bought it a few months ago) I
attempted replacement in the bus. This does in fact appear to be impossible.

This site:

http://www.specialpatrolgroup.co_dot_uk/spooky/barrel/barrel.html

Shows the removal of the peened on lock mechanism cover. Is this necessary?

Since I have no electrical part available for now, I'm going to just put it
back the way it was for now and hot wire it in the engine compartment.

&gt; Ric,
&gt;
&gt; Just went through this and did a huge writeup on it.  Probably not in the
&gt; archives yet.
&gt;
&gt; Electrical switch:  probably the culprit.
&gt;
&gt; Mechanical lock cylinder:  probably not, but mine was bad (tested with 3
&gt; elec. Switches) due to the months of wrenching it to start with gorilla
&gt; strength.  Had to replace elec. and mechanical components.
&gt;
&gt; Having to hold the key in place indicates some cylinder barrel trouble to
&gt; me.
&gt;
&gt; It CANNOT be replaced in the bus.  There is a hidden spring on the lock
&gt; cylinder you have to press down through an access hole in the switch
&gt; housing, so you MUST pull it from the bus, but believe me, it is not that
&gt; bad.
&gt;
&gt; The hardest part is depressing the spring correctly and pulling the
&gt; cylinder.
