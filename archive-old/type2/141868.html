Subject: Headliner Removal

Removal of the headliner is very easy.  At least mine was, it was falling
apart (1972 vintage).  I had a new one professionally installed.  The new
TMI Headliner was so heavy, solid white vinal, that it took 9 guage edge
wire for the bows to hold it up.  You would think that 9 guage wire would
not move, it did.

It also required wiring the ends of the bows together and tying each side to
the front and the rear.

Now everything is perfect with the headliner, all the side windows are
reinstalled, just have the windshield to go.  That job will be tackled this
weekend if I can scare up some help, or I just may pay someone to do it.
