Subject: Re: [T2] New starter on 78 Westfalia

Is the trans standard or auto?  Typically, the 2 versions of transmission
require different starters.

Subject: [T2] New starter on 78 Westfalia


&gt; I am working on my first Starter installation on my 78 Westfalia Bus.
&gt; I have researched the list and found some great information for
&gt; installation instructions.. Thanks !
&gt;
&gt; Couple questions:
&gt;
&gt; 1) Do I have the right starter ? I ordered a new starter from one of our
favorite
&gt;     vendors and they sent me a brand new (not rebuilt) Bosch starter. On
&gt;     the order paperwork it says product number SR87X. On the actual Bosch
&gt;     Starter is says 9 000 042 035. The problem is I looked at my old
starter
&gt;     and I have 2 seperate wires plugged into two spade connections on
&gt;     the starter selenoid. On the new stater there is only one spade
connector.
&gt;
&gt;     I called the vendor today and they said this is the correct starter
and
&gt;     that I may need to wire it differently !! ??
&gt;
&gt;     Can anyone shed some light on if this is the correct starter and how
&gt;     I should connect it to this starter with only one spade connector ?
