Philip,
I found a few small pictures of this cinema conversion bus.  It's a high top 
split window. About a '65.  It's in the recent book, &quot;VW Bus, The First 50 
Years 1949-1999&quot;, by Keith Seume with Michael Steinke.  The pictures are on 
page 30.  There must be pics on the web too, but I'm not sure where.  This 
bus has been shown at many SoCal VW shows and is owned By Charlie Hamill.  
Hope this helps.

&gt;I believe that one of the conversions available for Type 2's was a van that
&gt;could be expanded(?) to show movies or at least public
&gt;information/instruction films.
&gt;
&gt;I have looked through my various books and never been able to find out
&gt;details of this conversion apart from the fact that it existed. Does anyone
&gt;have any pictures of such a van on-line ? or better still a drawing ? or is
&gt;able to tell me of a book with these in ?
&gt;
&gt;At the moment the most I am likely to do is make a model of one, bit who
&gt;knows perhaps someone might consider building the real thing. How about 
&gt;that
&gt;for an unusual project !
