I have just finished down-loading &amp; printing the full BA6 manual from
vintagebus_dot_com &amp; would just like to thank Thom for taking the time to put
such info on a web site. It just goes to show the commitment made by all us
Bus owners, not only to our own Bus, but to others as well. I used to be on
a Mini mail list &amp; although the input was more light-hearted -but over 200
messages a day :( - the support between members was not as active as here.
As they say you only miss something when it's gone &amp; with the new host down
time &amp; digest probs, I really felt with-drawl!

Thank you to all those who help to keep this list &amp; all the web sites, not
only up, but full of one-of-a-kind, up to date info.
