&gt; Where is the data for synthetics???
&gt; I *know* that you know your stuff, but share!

&gt; I use mobil 1 in F**d, but am afraid to use it in my bugs.  Every time
&gt; that I do, it seems to get sucked up faster than 1 qt/3,000 miles.

I use 5w-50 synthetic in my buses and have since 1976.  just now have
switched from Pennzoil to Castrol since Pennzoil discontinued the 5-50

my 78, 2liter is using 0 oil between changes. 

gotta work at it to get a VW engine tight but it is not impossible
just doing the basic stuff by the book, Vitron seals on the push rod tubes
helps too!
