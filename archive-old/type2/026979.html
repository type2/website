Subject: FS:  VW Drive away Tent - Best Offer

A basic Drive away tent.  Condition unknown.

Located in Springfield VA  (10 miles off Route 66; On the way to Manassas 
Bug Out 50, stop by and see it)

I bought it because the owner was leaving the area in 6 hours, and I thought 
someone in my Northern Virginia 'community' could use it.

It has all the poles, but I never took the basic tent out of its bag.

(One of the 'Y' tubes was repaired/welded.  The others poles are original 
condition)

It is NOT a show tent, but a camping tent.

$225 or best offer.  &quot;Best offer&quot; to me would be someone who wanted to spend 
10 hours helping me to get my '72 Westy on the road!! or a team of 4 people 
_at_ 2.5 hours each, and then you all could flip a coin for the tent!?!?!
