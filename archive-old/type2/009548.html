&gt; &gt;      I'm hardly an expert here, but I've been told, and it makes sense,
&gt; &gt;that oil's come a long way since Bently published those specs.
&gt; &gt;Incidentally, the same chart exists on my '78 owners manual, so this is
&gt; &gt;pretty old data, I wouldn't be surprised if oil is better made these
&gt; &gt;days.
&gt;
&gt;


The oil chart is the same in my 85 MB owners manual. The quality and/or
additive package may have changed over the last 14 years but 40 weight is
still 40 weight. The viscosity rating hasn't changed.
