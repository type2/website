On the archives page http://vw.i405_dot_com/ there is a link to &quot;Sample of how to
use Complex Search&quot;. Click on this link.   It will take you to a page
http://vw.i405_dot_com/sample1.asp with some samples of complex searches . On this
page, there is a link to &quot;Tips for Complex Search use. &quot;. Click on this link. 
It will take you to the &quot;Tips For Searching&quot; page
http://vw.i405_dot_com/ixtiphlp.htm .  

Read this page.

At the bottom of this page, you will see a link to the &quot;Query Language&quot; page
http://vw.i405_dot_com/ixqlang.htm . On this page you will find detailed
information on the language of search engines.

If you need more information than what is on http://vw.i405_dot_com/ixqlang.htm ,
consult the CIS department at your local university. ;-P

Happy searching,

Clark

&gt; I have found the instructions for doing a search of the archives a little
&gt; confusing. I don't know much about search criteria and was wondering if
&gt; someone could help me out a little. Please assume I am younger than 9 or
&gt; older than 40. 
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to do searches for multiple word criteria such as &quot;disk
&gt; brakes&quot; or &quot;oil cooler&quot;. How would I present such criteria to the search
&gt; engine so that I only get pages that contain the words as written and not
&gt; everything containing &quot;oil&quot; and &quot;cooler&quot;?
&gt; 
&gt; Any other search tips, tricks are welcome.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
&gt; John
