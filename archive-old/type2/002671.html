Subject: Shift linkage adjustment help needed.
Date: Sat, 3 Feb 2001 17:09:59 -0800

Hi all:

Completed the installation of my rebuilt trans and it sure sounds
better than the old one!

But... I'm having trouble getting the shift linkage adjusted properly.
Instead of the nice, straight &quot;H&quot; pattern I've experience for 20
years, I'm having to fight the reverse lock-out to get into 1st and
2nd, and when I'm in either of these gears the top of the shift lever
is so far left it's almost grazing my leg.

I've done the usual adjustment - trans in neutral, unclamp the center
shift rod from the rear shift rod, make sure there's 19mm of distance
from the front shift rod to the right-side shift mechanism housing,
reclamp the 2 shift rods - several times and I still can't get it
right.

Can anybody offer any thoughts on how to get this right?

TIA.
