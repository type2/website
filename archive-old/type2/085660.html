Subject: monitoring 2 batt with one voltmeter

Hello,

Is this possible?

What I am considering doing is setting up my Stereo/misc camping things to a 
switch, where I can toggle between running off of the main battery and the 
AUX one. I will run everything on the main one till we stop, switch over to 
AUX so I do not run the main dry while not moving/recharging.

Is there a way to hook up the voltmeter to monitor only the power source 
going via the switch - meaning it will tell me how much is on the main 
battery when driving and how much is on the AUX when stopped (and I have 
switched over?)

The VDO directions talk a lot about hooking it up to a switched 12v source 
and some kind of light switch power via the fuse box, but could I just give 
it it's power via the switch I use to toggle between batteries? Granted, I 
should hook one of them up to a switched source, so it doesn't stay on all 
the time..

thoughts, opinions, suggestions, derogatory statements?

thanks!

Christopher

PS - I bet most people mispell Westfalia as Wesphalia because of spell 
checkers.
