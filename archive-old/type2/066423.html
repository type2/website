 &quot;Snivel&quot; might be more appropriate.

 I just &quot;miked&quot; 32 intake and exhaust valves, used. 
Why? $10 per is why.

 I started out to build this &quot;quick and dirty&quot; engine so I can get this van
mobile.

 I've got as many old parts as the rest of you. Ought to be able to
get some kind of &quot;trasher&quot; out of all this stuff.

 Anything I had to have was &quot;rebuilt or re-ground&quot; or just plain
&quot;used&quot;.

 So I put some major hours into an old case that came out just fine.

 Selected a crank from my pile and got some bearings that don't fit 
too bad. Fit the case so fine it has to be illegal.

 Reground cam and lifters from FLAPS.

 Since stuff is not all &quot;new&quot;, I'm doing a lot of fitting and measuring to
make sure it's gonna fly.

 Everything is looking good, had the case apart 6 times just checking stuff.

 I'm putting in the last lifters (reground) when I playfully took a look at
the faces of the last 2 by putting them together and look at
the &quot;curved&quot; faces.

 They have none. . . . Flat.
I finished putting them in anyway while I thought about it.

 Then in another fit of whimsy, I pushed one up against the cam to
watch the smooth action as the &quot;bump-stick&quot; does it's thing.

 These flat lifters are hitting on corners and dropping on centers
and what in the hell is this?

 It would seem the curved face is to match the &quot;lobes&quot;. DUH!!

 So I'm back to the FLAPS 30 miles away waving flat things in his face
and saliva all over his counter top.

 He has about fifty sets of these so he just gave me 10 sets to pick 
from.  Matched against a new one.

 While I'm doing this the local farm boys come in and buy $200 worth
of chrome. They're happy. It will go fast with that stuff on it.

 I ended up getting &quot;new&quot; lifters.
 
 I'm happy now, right?

 I was so happy I went home and set up the cam in vee blocks and put
the &quot;clock&quot; on it.

 Besides not being straight there were no two lobes even close to
each other as far as lift. As in .030&quot; difference.

 Back to the FLAPS. . . . . this time I did a &quot;Hoover&quot; on him and took 
my measuring sticks with me.

 One out of three new cams was &quot;in spec&quot;. A mere .005&quot; diff.

 Now we get back to the 32 valves. They're all border-line or under.

 I should re-bush the heads I have but I just can't afford any more tools.

 So I'm going back tomorrow and get all new valves.

 I would use the ones I have if I was stuck in the desert in Zaire
and only had a quart of water to get me to town. They will suck some
wind.

 I've already replaced all the studs in the heads, had to have two more taps
to chase threads and still need one for the spark-plug holes.

 Valve Springs: I have springs I can push with my fingers and some 
that I can't. Supposed to be 126 _at_ x dim.
 Now I have to build a spring tester.

 No-one seems to have one in the whole Southern Oregon.

 Can't trust the new springs either.

 If I just add up the cost of parts, I'm spending more on these heads
than a &quot;cheap re-built&quot; with &quot;new valves, springs and bushings.

 Makes me wonder just what they are selling you.

 I can hardly wait to match-weigh my pistons and check for &quot;head-height&quot;.
Little things like &quot;ring clearance&quot;.

 Maybe I should have just bought the chrome engine tin.
