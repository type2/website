Subject: Cheap ball joints, anyone?
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Another quicky cheap-parts offer.  One of my suppliers sent me a dozen
'68-79 ball joints (the good German Lemforders, not the cheapo Brazilian
ones) that I didn't order.  Before I return them to him next week, anyone
want them for a bargain-basement price of $13.95 each?  Shipping would be
$3.75 for up to 2, $6.00 for 3 or 4.
