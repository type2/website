Subject: Re: Fuel injected 1600

&gt;Ok Listees,
&gt;
&gt;I have a question but I don't mean to start a flame war. ;-)  With all 
the
&gt;supporters of fuel injection out there, how come no one has a fuel 
injected
&gt;1600 in their bus?  

Because all the supporters of fuel injection drive Type 4 engined Buses 
that already have it :-)
I believe Scott Allred has an aftermarket FI system in his '71 Bus.




VW has had a number of fuel injected 1600s in the type 3
&gt;and later beetles.  It seems that with all the frustration out there 
over the
&gt;34 PICT 3 carbs someone would have tried to transplant a FI system from 
a
&gt;beetle or type 3.  

This is an idea.  The FI system used on the '75 and later Beetles is the 
same as used on our '75 and later Buses, Bosch L-Jetronic.  The system 
used on the '67 and later Type 3s, though, is Bosch D-Jetronic, which 
seems to have a reputation for being finicky.  

I am highly tempted to take a fuel-injected Beetle engine and put it in 
my '74 Karmann Ghia.  I would, however, need an FI gas tank (has an 
outlet and a return inlet), I would need to run a fuel return line from 
the engine to the gas tank, I would need to figure out how to rig up an 
air cleaner.  I'd need to see what needs to be done with exhaust -- 
could I use the stock exhaust and heat exchangers or would I have to go 
with those from the FI model years?  If the latter, will they work with 
my heat ducts/cables (they probably should since the pans of the Beetle 
and Ghia are similar, but you never know).  I think the engine would 
physically fit in the engine compartment just fine, but it's the details 
that will get you.

It would be a lot of work, I think.  And probably much more of a pain in 
the butt than just buying a new Solex 34 PICT-3 which is probably what I 
really need to do :-)
