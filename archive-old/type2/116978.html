Subject: belly panels

Of the two large belly panels on the '68 bus I have, the drivers side has
about 1/2 of it hacked out for what appears to be an a/c condenser.  So now
there is a large hole there which is great for collecting mud and holding
moisture in the remaining panel......  Are these structurally needed?  Can
I safely remove this panel for the summer and replace it this winter during
hibernation?  My '72 does not have these panels......
Thanks list!
