Subject: Alcohol In Fuel
Date: Tue, 17 Nov 1998 21:49:43 PST

As I read Freds report on alchohol in fuels I thought I should add 
something. He states that feul lines, carbs, and other pieces will have 
deterioration problems. Let me add this...Dual port heads will have the 
same problem with thier manifolds. The rubber seals will fail over time, 
from what I beleive is from bad gas. Given that I have had to work on VW 
dual port manifold seals far more frequently over the last several years 
gives indication that this is true. No wonder I always run a single 
port. Additionally, I have seen the barrels or jugs of engines running 
high alcohol fuel look like sandpaper hit them.
I would say that with a type 1 engine for daily driving, I would use 
single port heads, and possibly use Marvs Mystery Oil to overcome the 
alcohol problem.
My thoughts,
Jason S.
