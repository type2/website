Subject: Looking for a cover for the late westy spare tire cabinet

I've searched TS for a while now.  I'm still looking for the Westy spare 
tire cabinet cover from a late westy (78).  I'm not sure what other 
years have the same camping interior.  75-79 perhaps?  Anyone have one 
of these they're willing to part with?
