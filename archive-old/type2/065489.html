Jeff plans to build a pair of platforms to safely hold a car 8&quot; in the
air.  One step more ambitious plan was in Popular Science and Mechanix
Illustrated years ago:  a pair of wooden triangular prisms.  Viewed from
the side, a very squatty triangle with a base 2 feet longer than the 
wheelbase of the car and a height of 1 foot.  Viewed end-on, 1.5 feet 
wide.  Place one prism, upside down (ie triangle base up), in front of
each front wheel.  Drive on, and position the car close enough to the
balance point so that you can rock the whole car nose up, tail up, or
both ends one foot up.  

I probably wouldn't have the confidence to construct the prisms the way
PS&amp;MI recommended (of 2x4s and plywood).  I like to hold up the car with
wood.  Not with wooden *structures*, but with wood.  Like a stack of
2x12x12 tiles.  They're not going to bend, snap, break a weld, scratch
the car.  Maybe the triangular prisms could be made out of a pile of 
12x2 planks of decreasing lengths.  Probably end up costing just a little
more than the electric lifts that I've always coveted, in the color
pages at the front of Hemmings.

PS when my engineer brother in law saw the main beam of my rather small
deck, he asked me if I planned to park my car there.  It's 2 2x6s 
sandwiching a 4x4.  Better safe than sorry.
