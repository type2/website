&gt; I'm curious becuase I love the simplicity of my air cooled engine, but
&gt; I'd love to get to something more sustainable, like a diesel engine
&gt; running on veggie oil.  This is especially pertinent in Cali where
&gt; there's legislation under consideration which would drastically raise
&gt; the taxes on gasoline over the next 6 years, as coupled with other 
&gt; programs to gently prod (v|f)olks towards more enviro-friendly transport.
&gt; 
&gt; Sure, electric is one solution, but at present, it's not a long-distance
&gt; (700+ mile roadtrip) solution -- at least not until there are more
&gt; charging stations nationwide.

I'd like to attempt to pre-empt any threads on how environmentally
friendly diesel/bio-fuels are versus electrical vehicles, etc., by
saying that anyone interested in debating that topic should
contact me directly as opposed to clogging up the type2 list.  This
topic is already on the fringes of bus content and there's no need
for a debate on what's enviro-friendly and what's not -- at least not
here. 

cheers,
