I have a 73 Westy with 170,000 miles on it and leaks some oil. Compression
is 65, 70, 70, 70. I'd be thrilled if it was in the 80s! But, it runs
beautifully, albeit gutless. Chip, the mechanic, refuses to replace the
motor until it actually quits. His theory is &quot;If it ain't busted, don't fix
it.&quot; It is a little hard to live the anxiety of wondering when it is going
to quit on me, but I've been driving it for three years like this with very
little trouble. Triple A helps me deal with the worry. This bus isn't my
daily driver, but it could be. I live in Tucson and the temptation to drive
the F*rd with airconditioning is more than I can resist.

Sounds like your motor is tired, but still serviceable. Listen to it
carefully, make yourself familiar with its quirks. I believe the most
important diagnostic tool we have for our busses is our ears. You will know
when the end is near. Get Triple A for the inevitable. 

Happy Bussing!
