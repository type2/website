Subject: 1600 DP engine (new) with bad #2 cylinder

Ever since the accelerator pump injection tube got sucked into the 
engine, #2 cylinder misfires.  I had first discovered the problem when 
I pulled the #2 spark plug and saw the the electrode was bent so that 
there was hardly any gap.  I looked down into the carburetor and saw 
that the aforementioned tube was missing, so I deduced that is what 
caused the spark plug electrode to get bent.  I straightened it out, 
but it never ran right.  I pulled the spark plug again (actually all of 
them - to do a compression test, which was dead even at 115 pounds)) 
and the #2 spark plug was black - all the rest were OK.  I put in new 
spark plugs and #2 turned black again.  Pulling spark plug wires with 
the engine idling causes RPM to drop on all cylinders, but less on #2.  
Switching spark plug wires (#1 for #2) makes no difference.  They all 
register about 1000 ohms.  Valve lash is fine.  What am I missing?  Do 
I have to pull the engine?  It's a new meximotor which I had installed 
about 5,000 miles ago.
