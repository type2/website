Subject: EGR and Charging light on

Hi,

The EGR and carging lights came on this weekend on my 78 westfalia. As far
as I know there is no EGR stuff left on the bus. I am trying to figure out
if my alternator is charging or not. Unfortunately, the poles to the
alternator are not accessible. When I start the engine the reading on the
battery poles stays at the same 12 volts as before it is started. THis test
on my friends BMW showed 14v when started vesus 12 before. When I pull the
connector from the voltage regulator and connect my meter in series with
each of the D+ and DF there is no measurable voltage. Does this mean that
the alternator is not putting our any power? The test in the Bentley is more
detailed for the 71 and earlier bus setup and that test was the best I could
do  without a variable resistor. 

Given the earlier post about the periodic EGR light could that have
something to do with my carging light as well and in fact my tests are
inconclusive?

Bob
