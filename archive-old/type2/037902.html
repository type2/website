Subject: Replacement sill panels

Hi all,

Does anybody out there know of a source(or at least a lead)on
aftermarket sill panels for Double cab pickups? This is the
one located below the rear passenger door,or the corresponding
position on the non-door side.

They were still available new from VW in the Fatherland until
recently and a few years back I had no trouble ordering one here 
in Oz.Stupidly I only ordered one and as the restoration of my
'76 DC is in (kinda)full swing I have decided to replace both
the sill panels as the one I thought was still good is showing
the very first signs of rusting through.

Now the panels are NLA from VW (just when you really need the
bloody things) but I thought perhaps there may be an alternative
source of these kind of things from a repro type place somewhere
in the US.

Any suggestions or am I just p*ssing in the wind...?
All responses gratefully received.
Thanks,
