Missing the Microbus

Q. Why is there so little information about the VW Microbus on any
of the official VW Web pages? The most informative page I have
found is www.scottvw_dot_com.

A. That's because the Microbus is only about halfway from
introduction as concept to full-scale production car.  It was
introduced at the North American International Auto Show in 2001
and will go into production in 2005, ready for sale by the end of
that year.  Even the Web site you mention offers no more than the
www.vw_dot_com, other than extra pictures of the concept car.  Tony
Faladpour, VW spokesman, says the production car, which will be
built in Hannover, Germany, is likely to be faithful to the concept
car, with an aim to combine fun with the practicality.  The concept
car was powered by a 230-horsepower V-6, and I expect a similar
engine will end up in this retro-yet-futuristic people hauler.
