Subject: Re: [T2] my $100 paint job

Two excellent marine paints are made by Awlgrip, or Petit---but are not
epoxy.
They are a urethane, and much easier to work with than the easypoxy, and
are readily available at West Marine, as well as Boat US--which both
have web sites to order from.

This stuff is really bullet proof--no Tony, this isn't the brand
name--:&gt;)

&lt;&lt; Alas, it's $85 a gallon and it would've taken me a week and a half to
get 
it. I've already been sitting in primer for a week and want to finish
this 
project. The paint I found was called EASYPOXY, available from
WestMarine 
(store name, not company). There were about 20 colors. 
Mat &gt;&gt; 
Try and get a brand name on that paint...A buddy of mine has a boat and
looks at the WestMarine catalog first to find out what he needs, then
does a search for the same &quot;stuff&quot; at non-boating prices...In general,
although WestMarine carries quality &quot;stuff&quot;, I found their pricing to be
masochistic:-(
