Subject: Cleanin' ol' brake drums.

Hey all:

I have a question to put out to you all [and no fear of a Hoover
knuckle rapping as he should be in the Yukon today].

While I am waiting for my wheel kits to arrive from Bus Boys ;), I
thought I would have a closer boo at ye ol' brake drums.
Surprisingly, after soaking for a week much of the rust just wiped
right off.  None of them appear to have been turned before [this is a
good thing given that hens teeth are easier to find around here] and
they do not appear to be scarred all that bad [I will check for
roundness tomorrow].  However, one of the rear drums [the one that
was not at all impressed about leaving the axle] has a light film of
rust on the inside.

Since I would rather not turn the drums now if at all possible, what
are the pros an cons of using a very fine grit [say 600-1000] wet
paper to clean the inside surface rust off the drums?  Is this a
definite bad idea...or am I just being overly cautious?

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Splits...Oh, my!

Roy
