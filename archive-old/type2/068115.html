Subject: GEX advice sought

The mechanic  has now removed the left-side cylinder head on our 2 litre
Vanagon engine. The intake seat for no. 3 is  dislodged and needs to be
repaired. The bottom end is in good shape as many  on the list predicted. I
have spoken to both the Mark Stephens people and GEX. Here are my options.

1. A fellow at GEX (named Mick) when pressed, offered to repair the cylinder
head at their cost, if it could be demonstrated that the engine had not been
overheated. Initially he insisted that I return the head to them for
inspection before a decision could be made. I made it clear that I did not
want to go through the same hassles as many others have in negotiating a
deal with GEX. The mechanic here has  since determined that the engine has
not overheated. If that is indeed true then GEX will replace the head (or
rebuild it) at their cost plus pay the shipping, or so says Mick.

My main concern here is ensuring: a) that the head that  comes back is
improved over the version that failed and b) that I will actually get the
head back at no cost. Given the current situation (failure at 20,000 miles,
change in ownership at GEX and their reputation problems), I am reluctant to
take up GEX's offer. GEX claims to now follow a procedure similar to MS in
rebuilding heads. GEX also failed to respond to any of the three e-mail
messages that I sent out three days ago.

2. MS will rebuild both heads (or just the one) for 180.00 not including
shipping with a turn around time of 3-5 days. Initially when I balked at
naming the company who sold the engine, the MS guy said &quot; was it G-E-X?&quot; so
he seems familiar with their reputation. They also rebuld heads for VW of
Canada.

Which path would you take?
