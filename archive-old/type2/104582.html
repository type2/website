Subject: Re: [T2]  Whats goin' on?-type 4 gurus

&gt;Symptoms ;Type 4 1800 engine which starts and runs fine until you stop 
&gt;and shut down for gas or whatever-start engine and the engine  starts 
&gt;but will only just run until you have held the gas pedal down ,
&gt;eventually the revs slowly pick up until its reving at full with lots 
&gt;of smoke,smoke clears and bus runs fine until the next time this 
&gt;happens-any ideas type 4 gurus

Single (probably Solex) carb, right?  Sounds like vapor-lock to me.  Make
sure your fuel filter is clean and make sure your fuel line is NOT touching
the engine case or anything else that gets really really hot.  Use some
plastic wire ties or whatever you can think up and support the fuel line so
it gets better air flow around it.

You'd be amazed how hot it gets in your engine compartment when you shut off
your motor.  I've got one of those nifty indoor/outdoor thermometers in my
73 with the &quot;outdoor&quot; sender mounted inside the engine compartment.  On the
highway on a 80 degree day my engine comparment temps read around 90-95
degrees.  Shut off the motor for 5 minutes and the temps spike past the 120
degree limit of my thermometer.
