Subject: Re: [T2] Horn Button Removal

&gt; I am parting out my '73 Type 2, and was wondering how I remove the horn
&gt; button from the steering wheel?

pry the button up carefully.
around and around with a thin edge like a knife between the button and the
aluminum ring. until you pop it out.
it has a spring metal ring around the side of the button that kind of
locks it on a little so dont get frustrated.
