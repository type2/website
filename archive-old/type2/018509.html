Isaiah,
I  have an extra light assy I picked up at a swap meet, fairly good
shape, can't attest to it's &quot;non-leakability&quot; but it's got a seal with
it (again, fair shape). This one also has a drain hole, which I don't
have on mine, perhaps a PO drilled it, but it effectively make it a
right side lens, i.e. passenger side US. If your other lens has no hole,
you can swap 'em. Yours for the postage, p-mail me.

While we're at it, anyone have an extra wiper arm for a '68? The kind
that clamps around the wiper shaft, about a 1/4&quot; diameter, the arm is 15
1/4&quot; long (I know, it's not metric). One of mine is cracked, and a bit
wobbly. It may be one of those &quot;one year only&quot; parts, I haven't been
able to locate one new OR used.
