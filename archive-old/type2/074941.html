&gt;A bumper sticker we'd like to see on the next gas guzzling SUV with an=20
&gt;american flag on its antenna -..... &quot;I Just Don't Get It!&quot;.....


UH, don't our buses get just about as poor gas mileage as those SUV's?
Ok, some of these monstrosities get about 8 mpg (I hope I'm exaggerating =
but probably not)
but that is the extreme.  If we're lucky, we get 20.  Better than 8, but =
not too good. =20
But I don't drive my bus for the gas mileage, I drive it because it has =
style.
