DONE!!!!

I got sick of dicking around with this thing, so I did a little logical
thinking and came up with what I thought was the correct order. Got that
gasket around the bore and finally got the damn bolt in.

I really didn't think it did much, but after I took it for a ride, I could
feel a REAL difference. I still have a little play in the wheel, but it is
not nearly as sloppy as it was before.
