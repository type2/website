                       &quot;My mind tells me there was a plastic connector the
goes to the
regulator on the R/H side of the firewall.I think I may have removed it and
am wondering if that is correct&quot;


I corrected myself tonight while cleaning the engine tin I saw the plastic
connector on the end of the Alt wires:)
Just had to look I guess.

Thanks
Phil
