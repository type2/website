My 2 cents... I have to agree with Harmon. I wouldn't have burned my valves
up on the last engine if I had known that the CHT was climbing when the AFC
started to act up on the FI. Now I have a CHT gauge and I have come to rely
on it as kind of an early warning system for the basic health of the engine.
I don't have oil temp but intend to put it in this summer.

As always, FWIW. 8)

»&gt; By the way, I think that CHT is an ideal candidate for idiot light
»&gt; status. Either CHT is 'getting too high' or it's 'okay.' Who cares what
»&gt; the actual temp is? (Oil temperature is a different story).

»temp. I watch my CHT during my initial warmup to tell me when it
»gets to 200
