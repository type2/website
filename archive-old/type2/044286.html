&gt;Has anybody heard of 'electric in-line heaters' for buses?  I have a 77
westy that I am thinking of cutting out those useless rusted heater boxes,
and would like to replace with a 'engine to muffler' combo.  Has anyone
heard of such a thing?
&gt;
&gt;A friend showed me the electric heaters in a catalog about a year ago, but
neither one of us can find that catalog now.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Mike


It seems like a great idea but if you're thinking of an electric fan heater
or the like, the amount of power you'd need to pull out of the
generator/battery would probably be too much to get anything useful. I had
an electric windscreen demister for my Beetle, but it was so pathetic I
demanded my money back.

I suspect the in line heater you are thinking of is a fan you fit between
the heat exchangers and the cab. That is reported to be very effective, but
you still need those heater boxes in good order.
