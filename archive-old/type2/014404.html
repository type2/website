Subject: Re: [T2] 75-79 exhaust WHATS THE BEST?

  I am sure the orig is best and it is super expensive with?

I've got an 83 Air Cooled and I prefer the quiet OEM for several reasons,
I actually get some heat out of the heater boxes and the quiet muffler
system lets me hear potential engine problems, CV rattle, loose cargo
etc. I've bought and sold several 80-83 Vanagons and Westies and although
I liked some of the after market systems I still prefer the stock quiet
system. There are several Empi and other brand systems available from
list vendors that are good quality for less than $100.00 if you want
after market sport systems. Ask for you list discount when you order, it
is often enough to cover your freight.

Stan Wilder.
