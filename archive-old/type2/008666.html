Once again I take keyboard in greasy hands.....

I have the following available after some hours of turning wrenches on
the 2 beasties in the front yard...

2 (pair?) right side FI intake manifold tubes w/injectors
2 (pair?) left side FI intake manifold tubes w/injectors
1 FI intake manifold center section

(Don't have any idea if the injectors are good or not)

2 FI control boxes (brains)

(Don't know if they're good or not either)

All was just pulled off a '77 2.0L and '79 2.0L bus.

Both have been carberated (hence the unknown status of the injectors)
and I am replacing the intake manifolds.

Price?  Make me an offer.....

I'm willing to swap if someone has anything I need/can use.

I also have a complete A/C setup that i'm considering pulling out of
the '79....  Anyone interested?
