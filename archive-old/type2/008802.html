How many of you watched the first episode of &quot;The Century&quot; on ABC on Mon
and noticed the minimum 30 busses (mostly Westies) shown parked/camped in a
flyover of the then Kennedy Space center waiting for the manned rocket
launch in 1969?    Looked more like a current VW show!

PS- before next Fri the ol' 78 Westy should pass 200K on its never failed
engine!  To celebrate I got a new canvas top, poptop seal, and new front
rotors from the BUS Depot.   Am considering going to that NC campout over
the 17th- anyone from Pa/DC area going?
