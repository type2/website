Hi Listees!

If anyone wants to see a VERY cool installation of a water cooled engine
into an air cooled type 2, go to http://home.earthlink_dot_net/~dmh012/v6vwp.htm

I particularly like the &quot;stealth&quot; radiator.  This works well for loafs as
they often have the spare tire on the front.  Check it out.
