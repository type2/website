I have one of these that I pulled off my 73 and put on the bumper of my 71.
I did this to cover the Empi Muffler/header. It looks good and would look
better if it were painted. I know of no new ones available, I would sell
mine, but I notched it for the trailer hitch. So it is missing a section 1in
by about 6in out of the middle. I really does look good on the early ones.

Hope this helps,
