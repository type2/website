Subject: Reliable Garage In LA

Gang:

Obliviously, from my last email I need a new starter for my brothers 78
Campermoblie.  However, the camper is down in LA with my brother.  I would
do it if it was up here, however he can not.  Can someone give me the name
of a good garage for air cooleds in LA?  Someone that can handle electrical
problems?

-Wayne
