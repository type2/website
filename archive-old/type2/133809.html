&lt;&lt; You know, restyling the EV to be somewhat more
microbus-like is a nice thought, but I'd probably
be interested in damn near anything that VW would
bring to market if it was economical and
utilitarian.  &gt;&gt;

Boy are you out of the marketing loop...;-)
Try as it might to escape the Beetle and
Bus connection (the Nouveau Beetle was
not completely favored by the VW high-
erups, although they did want a piece of
the retro pie), VW (as well as most estab-
lished automakers) would really prefer not
to make economical and utilitarian (read
low-priced, plain) vehicles...You've got to
sell too many of 'em to make a profit...
The big buck is obviously in high end cars,
or SUV's...Which all the biggies are making
(even Porsche and having quality control
problems with it, BTW)...Companies try to
distance themselves from their own products
(Ford has Lincoln, Honda has Acura, etc.) but
VW has one of the most recognizable names
in the industry and can't realistically add another
name to the $60,000 Phaeton to justify the cost
of a very expensive VW...The low sales of the
Phaeton are a result of this...No matter what the
Phaeton is, quality and performance wise, the nag-
ging question remains...Who pays that kind of money 
for a mere VW...?-(
I'm sure the marketing boys at VW are tearing their 
hair out at VW...They've got a great marketing tool
in the VW logo...But what they'd prefer to sell is not
what the logo is remembered for... ;-(
