Subject: [T2] 1969 Westfalia Owners Manual Supplement?
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-Virus-Scanned: by Reliable-Net
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL - S


Does anyone know if there was ever a Westfalia owner's manual supplement 
printed specifically for 1969?  I've searched high and low and I've 
obtained ones dated 1968 and 1970, but I have yet to see one dated 
1969.  I've searched eBay, checked at Vintage Motorbooks (the one Fred S. 
recommends), searched places on the web, but no luck.  So now I'm starting 
to wonder if one exists?  Anybody have any proof otherwise?

Thanks.
