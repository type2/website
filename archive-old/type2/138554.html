Subject: Hopefully my last post about calipers…

Bob _at_ VW tech of Encinitas kindly ordered yet another caliper for me today 
and it was again not built properly: double bleeder screws but pistons 
cutouts at the top. That was the sixth caliper ordered in 7 days. We had 
enough and I decided to keep it.

However it was hurting my feelings to install a caliper with the pistons 
upside down. I called a machine shop and a mechanic to ask them whether they 
could turn the pistons of my double bleeder rebuilt caliper for me. Both 
yelled at me and told me that if the part I got was wrong, I should return 
it and get the right one. That was some really useful advice. One guy also 
said that by &quot;tampering with brakes, people get killed&quot;.

Eventually I used my foot air pump to blow the pistons out, turned them half 
a turn, put them back in and refitted the dust seal. It was simple to do and 
I cannot believe I did not think about this before. Hopefully the my job was 
decent and it won't leak.

FYI, the pistons started sliding out with about 4 bars of pressure (~60 
psi). It would probably take quite a bit more on an old caliper.

If things go well I should be able to hit the drying puddles tomorrow 
afternoon.
