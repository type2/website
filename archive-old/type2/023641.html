&lt;&lt; Are there any bus experts out there in Colorado Springs that might be able 
to 
 give me a hand on saturday afternoon doing some diagnostics on my bus.  I 
 can't figure out what's making me stall so consistantly, but I'm assuming 
 it's a pretty simple problem that can be fixed with a little help.
 please email me.
 thanx

Dave,

  I used to live in the Springs and plan to move back next year. Does it buck 
and kick before it dies or does it die on deceleration, like when your 
slowing to come to a stop. If its bucking and kicking you may be suffering 
&gt;from vapor lock. From what I understand because of the altitude, gas boils at 
a lower temp. Does it happen much more on warmer days? If this is the case 
you have some options.
 Make sure your fuel line is not touching against somewhere where it can 
absorb heat from either the engine or tranny. If it is, resecure it and 
insulate the line. I've used that foam tape that they sell in hardware stores 
to wrap pipes to keep them from freezing. One typical spot for it to absorb 
heat is where it runs through the engine compartment near the cylinder head .
 If this doesn't do it for you you could buy an aftermarket electic fuel pump 
and fuel pressure regulator ( if the pump is set up for more than about 3.5 
pounds of pressure ). I've never had to use this method but hear its a sure 
fire way to stop vapor lock.

 If its just dying on deceleration I would do a complete tune up and check 
your carb for possible problems such as the needle valve sticking.Gunk in the 
fuel tank and filters could cause this problem also.
