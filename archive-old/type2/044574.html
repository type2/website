&gt; pain in the butt to adjust but not difficult, follow the Bentley

Thanks Bob, I just did this adjustment yesterday (as per Bentley) and it seems
fine now, but I had to extend the shift rod 3/4&quot;. I also have a little
vibration I didn't have before.. who knows, a road trip is called for to shake
her down I guess.
