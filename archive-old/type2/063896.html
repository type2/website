&gt; Is there a Splitty Rescue out there serving the same function?  I ask that
&gt; question because I have never seen a '67 or earlier in any of the junkyards

I've been thinking about this same issue.  I've even thought of a t-shirt 
design that would use the typical USA symbol for fire departments, but it 
would be for a Transporter Search &amp; Rescue squad.  

Richard Palmer.  Was it you who made the Vanagon list shirts?  How 'bout 
another project?
