Subject: Re: [T2] John Muir's son

&gt; When John Muir used a 009 dist, he used them in pre 70 VWs, which they do
&gt; actually work good in. I have a German one in my 65 Beetle (28 PICT carb)
&gt; and it works great. Its only when the 009 is used in a type IV engine or a
&gt; type I engine with a 34 PICT 3 carb that it sucks, especially now since most
&gt; 009s that people are using are made in Mexico or Brazil. I doubt that Muir
&gt; even owned a VW with a type IV engine. The fuel injection and type IV info
&gt; in the idiot book was written by Tosh Gregg.

the 009 and carbs that were designed around emissions control with dual
vac distributors are not a good combination.
