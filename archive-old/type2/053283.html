Thanks!  Midas quoted me a ~$500 repair job on the brakes.  They wanted to
replace both my rear drums at a meager $99 apiece as well as both wheel
cylnders for $60 each.  Of course the shoes were bad too, etc. etc.

Needless to say, I took the quote with the parts list down to my local
junkyard and got 2 freshly turned drums, 2 wheel cylnders, 4 new shoes,
cotter pins, castle nut removal tool, and a few odds and ends for $100.

I'm going to redo my brakes this weekend. I've never fussed with wheel
cynders before so it ought to be fun and worrisome!

Thanks for the thoughts!!

&gt; 
&gt; One of your probs sounds like your master cylinder has a good leak in it
&gt; causeing the pedal to go to the floor and you having to pump the brakes to
&gt; get them to work. I would suggest you order new hardware for your brakes,
&gt; master cylinder, check out the calipers to make sure they are in good order
&gt; meaning no cracks on the boots. I have never had work done by midas but i am
&gt; sure they do fine work. I am pretty sure they give you free quates so if i
&gt; was you i would go there and have them check it out and see what they say you
&gt; all need so you can pick up parts if they don't have them. The chances of
&gt; them having your brake parts in stock is slim.
