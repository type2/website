Subject: Re: &quot;One man brake bleeder&quot; Gravity addendum

We gravity bleed brakes all the time at work.....   mind you that they can
not always be gravity bled....  if it is just a line that is replace it
usually can be gravity bled, but if replacing wheel cylinders, or calipers,
it should be pressure bled ( either manually, or with a pump of some sort)
and masters cylinders should always be pressure bled....

when the bleeder is cracked open while gravity bleeding you can see the air
escaping through the bleeder valve, by not seeing this it is hard to imagine
it working.... but it does.....  you can feel the diference in the pedal
also...  it feels no different from a pressure bled system.......
