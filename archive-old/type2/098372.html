Subject: Re: [T2] Back Window leak

is the rear hatch seal new also? my window seal was ok but the hatch seal
was bad, so water came in down the window from the top of the door.

&gt; It is possible that the seal is good but the metal
&gt; under it is bad. I had this problem with my bus.

 Got a leak inside the back window of my 71 Westy.
&gt; &gt; The rubber seal looks
&gt; &gt; brand new, one of the best rubber pieces on the bus.
&gt; &gt; Can't figure this out.
