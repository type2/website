Subject: Re: [T2] Major electrical problem

Jason,

This symptom sounds very much like a little bit of &quot;fun&quot; I had Labor Day 
Weekend.  I pulled the negative lead off the battery and it looked 
clean, but I cleaned it anyway.  Tried to start it again and it cranked 
for a second and then everything went dark again.  Pulled the positive 
side and it had a lot of corrosion on the inside, outside looked clean.  
Cleaned up that lead and the van started up and ran just fine... until 
the next stop.  I came out from the store and the same thing happened.  
I tweaked on both connections again and hooked them up. 

This time as I was connecting up the negative lead I got the usual 
little tiny spark, but not at the terminal.  It was about three inches 
down in the woven cable.  Aha! Bad cable! 

That's when I discovered the kludge job of a cable installation that a 
evil previous owner did. He had run a webbed cable from the negative 
terminal on the battery down to a bolt on the frame rail, then back up 
to the ground point on the bulkhead 6 inches from the negative terminal 
on the battery.

Anyway, I replaced the negative cable and all is well.  In fact, the 
starter seems to run faster (to my ears).

Anyway, there's another vote towards checking those battery cables.

Good Luck!

&gt; The Bus didn't get driven at all on Monday.  Now today, I went out to 
&gt; start it up and move it to a different parking spot.  I crank the 
&gt; engine over, and it cranks for about 10 seconds (I haven't had a 
&gt; chance to deal with my cold start problem yet).  Near the end, I 
&gt; notice the warning lights are blinking.  I turn the key off.  I turn 
&gt; the key back on, everything looks normal, then to start -- nothing.  
&gt; Turn the key off, back to on, nothing - no warning lights, radio does 
&gt; not work, etc.
