This one (first link below) looks a bit cobbled together (note the 
late model table) but this a Westfalia with Dormobile top. The 
interior is basically the same as the S044 which was a 1965? to 1967 
spilt camper from Westfalia that was available without  hardtop, 
Dor-Top or short Westy top. I do not know what to SO## is for this 
model.

Next is the bench seat version of the SO69  (baywindow to 1971 laminate)

The above was available in walkthru with a sink/icebox unit that is 
familiar to all here is the US. Also  it could be had with a standard 
blindspot cabinet or full width rear bed.

Thanks
Chris
