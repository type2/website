&gt; What does it take to convert a pancake bus(78) to upright motor(bug engine
&gt; 1600dp etc...)
&gt;
&gt; I hear Busboys has a tin kit for that purpose, I have a crack at a 78 west
&gt; in pretty clean shape, but the motors fried.   Thoughts, comments on
&gt; conversion vs repair(I hear quality parts are getting scarce on the ground
&gt; these days).  comments on Busboys(I've heard of delivery problems from a
&gt; couple people up here in the great NW).
&gt;

That's a lot of work to go through and have that little engine push that
westy.  I am in the process of a COMPLETE rebuild of a '78 2.0L.  Contact Bob
Donalds at Boston Engine Exchange.  My rebuild kit did not cost much more than
a rebuilt type I long block and parts are plentiful.
Bob is at http://www.bostonengine_dot_com  go through his web site.  He does know
what he's doing.

BTW, I'm in California &amp; he's in Boston and the shipping costs (both ways) was
less than buying local and paying sales taxes.
