Subject: RE: blinkers

&gt; My blinkers have been fine and then a few days ago (after a
&gt; ton of NE rain) I
&gt; get nothing except a quick click and the blinker lights don't
&gt; stay on, same
&gt; with the hazards, no blinking.

Seems like this is the only subject I can give any useful advice about,
but at least I get to give it a lot:

Sounds like the rain is more than a coincidence.  If your windshield or
washers or turnsignal housing leaks at all, water often trickles down
the inside of the bus and fills up the upside-down mounted relays for
the turn signal/hazards and high beams.  Find yours (they're below the
fusebox, IIRC), pull them out and give them a shake.  If they sound wet,
open them up, dry them out and clean the contacts, if necessary.  Or you
could just replace them.  If you can't easily find or fix your
windshield leak, you could try sealing the relays with silicone.
