kind of a trip report
kind of a breakdown story


I drove from pullman, WA to Olympia, WA and back last weekend in my
recently accquired '79 camper for a training session for a trip I am
taking to China this summer and to pick up a pressure washer and some
ladders for some houses I am painting.

About an hour out of pullman with headlights on and dire straits blasting
I saw a red light come on and quickly pulled over thinking damn I should
have checked the oil.  poured in a quart checked it-looked
overfilled--started it up and the light didn't go out--Oh thats a battery
light not an oil light.  Oh yeah the oil actually was OK when I left.
Hmmm alternator belt looks tight.  I'm the guy who complained earlier
about a burnt wire from my alternator to my solenoid so i looked to see if
the wire had shorted again and it looked fine.  I decided to keep on
driving and try to get to olympia were i could check things out at my
leisure.  I also had to be at a conference by seven that night.  so i shut
off the lights and stereo and kept driving.  made it to North Bend another
150 or so miles and stopped to pick up a guy hitching to the auto parts
store to fix a slipped out driveshaft on his ford pickup.  nobody in town
could/would charge the battery or had a new or old alternator to sell me.
so he got his parts and I started driving him back out to his rig when
my battery finally gave up and stopped.  He gave me ten bucks and kept on
hitching. I pulled my battery and carried it a 1/4 mile to a truck stop
and they charged it for an hour for me for free--nice.  hiked back--wow
batteries are heavy.  got to my conference. went home the next day and
found the store had got my wrong the wrong alternator--kind with round
hole and no bolt on back.  I returned it and got the right one.  Upon
removal and testing they said it was putting out about five something and
was definately bad.  I also noticed that when my wire from the alternator
to the solenoid burnt it ran alongside the wires fromthe alternator to the
regulator.  they were fried but i hadn't noticed when I replaced the other
wire. I rewired the harness installed the new alternator and am back up
and running.  I kept the old alternator and want to rebuild it and have it
as a spare--seems like a good spare part to have in the bus.  anybody else
carry a spare?  Can I rebuild it myself? how?  a book that will tell me?
Isearched the archive but didn't find much. any special tools i need?
cost of these?  is it worth it? or should I just have someone else do it.

overall it was a great trip in the bus and my left arm is sunburned from
hanging out the window on the westward leg.  its agood feeling to be able
to break down and fix things by youself without any tow trucks involved or
lots of expense.

I think i'm gonna like owning a bus.

have a great day.
