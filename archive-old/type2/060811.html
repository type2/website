Subject: Adjusting hydraulic lifters?

I know, I know.  Everyone says you don't need to adjust hydraulic lifters,
but I want to check 'em anyway.  I know how to do it on a solid lifter
beastie, but how are those hyrdaulics adjusted. 

I am doing this because I think that I am hearing lifter noise.  its a '73
bus, but it has been retrofitted with a 2000cc hydraulic with lifters,
engine.
