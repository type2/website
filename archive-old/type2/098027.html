How much heat do they really transfer, though?  Since most of the heat
comes from air and oil vapor, there is a limited heat transfer to the
cover.  Not much we can do about this, since even such actions as finning
the inside of the cover would be useless as there is little airflow inside
the covers.  As another poster said, the purpose of the cover is to hold
the oil in.
