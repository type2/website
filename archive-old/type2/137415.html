Ok, I've developed this annoying squeak in the front. It doesn't
squeak when I jump up and down on the bumper or rock it back and
forth, only when it's driving. ...snip....
Chris and his big green troll.
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
Hello Chris....You indicate that the sound is only heard when your bus is 
traveling. To me, that means it is coming from some unit that is always 
moving during travel. Since the sound is there most of the time, the unit 
that is causing the sound is not some part that is always moving, but some 
part that is in contact with a moving part.

Three suspects come to mind: The speedometer cable that ends in the 
driver-side front wheel; the disk brakes; and the rubber CV joint boots.

Since the boots are rubber and you describe the sound as a &quot;rubber squeak&quot; 
they deserve nomination. But they are moving all the time that the vehicle 
is in motion.

You could eliminate the speedometer cable by disconnecting it at the wheel. 
Undo the clip holding the cable to the dust cap. Then pull the cable out 
from the _inside_ of the spindle assembly. You could read in the archives 
the following post about an EGR box connected to the cable, that rumbled 
for one lister:

If the sound continues after eliminating the speedometer cable, you 
could  give closer attention to the way the calipers ride against/operate 
on the rotors. Another possibility is contact with the splash shield that 
covers the inner face of the rotor.

I had an annoying sound from the front end for years, and it turned out to 
be due to a crack in each of the small metal clips that hold the brake pads 
from rattling. (Name is &quot;anti-rattle clip.&quot;) About the size of a 
fingernail, bridging the space between the brake pads. Had to actually take 
them off and inspect them to find the crack, which had resulted from about 
25 years of metal fatigue. Hard to find replacements.

Well, there you have it....my suggestions. Others will supply more information.
