I have seen a few late model buses (with front mount spare tire) that have spare tire covers with the big VW emblem on them.  I have a 75 camper with front mount spare and I am dying to find one of these covers.  I've tried Motorworks, BusDepot, Bus Stop, and many other parts suppliers but can't seem to find them...Any one have any idea where I can get my paws on one???
Thanks, John Baker
