Volks,

1) I have had this strange gas smell for a while. Went away
after a couple of miles. Checked hoses, carbs etc etc.
 Finally today as I was leaving work I noticed a small wet
spot in a unusual place.
  Got under das bus and found that the vent hose from the
fuel pump (mech) was damp. Now this vent hose goes into a
hole in the tin under the heater box/valve cover etc. Why
it goes there I can only speculate. So I pulled it out of
there so any gas that came out would not go on the
tin/heater box area..... put a new longer hose on and
partially plugged it up and directed it away from anything
hot.
  Question becomes now... Should I get the mech. fuel pump
from Ron's Bus Depot or convert to the electric one?
Mech. = $138.oo or so.
elec. =  $39.00 or so.
  Is there and advantage to the mechanical one on a 74 dual
carbed engine or will the electric one do just as well?
2) to the guy who has bus is lugging when he puts his foot
into it on his 71... perhaps your fuel pump is &quot;short
stroking&quot;. Ron has that part to. They will wear and the
result is not enough stroke to operate the mech fuel pump
properly.
3) On Z beds... you can go to the Z products site as
someone already posted or you can check out wrecking yards
and pull one.

4) Seattle Spring meet is coming up on April 29th. Info on
my site.

   Happy trails!
