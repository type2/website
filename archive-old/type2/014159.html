&gt;Hi all,
&gt;Also, I'm looking into purchasing a rebuilt MOFOCO 1800 CC longblock
&gt;dual carb engine (milwaukee) and was curious if anyone has any feedback
&gt;about their work.
&gt;thanks much,
&gt;mark

Mark:

I've never bought anything from Mofoco personally, but when I was recently searching for new semi-performance heads, the folks at Gene Berg told me that Mofoco doesn't use the correct aluminum alloys in their heads, and that they're softer and more prone to valve seat slippage.  Berg recommended CB Performance heads.  What does this have to do with the engine you're considering buying from them???  Maybe nothing, maybe alot.
