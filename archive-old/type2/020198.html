We just had our first cold week here in Northern California (dipped into the mid 30's).  Anyway, the first day there was frost on my windshield is also the first day I had
trouble with my (new to me) used transmission.  I can't get the Beast into 1st or 2nd when it's cold.  The previous two months of driving on this (new to me) tranny were
just fine, but now I can't gently coax or forcibly push the shifter into 1st or 2nd.  And I can only get it into 1st or 2nd about 80% of the time when the tranny is warm.
I replaced the tranny oil with 85/90 GL4 but that didn't make a difference.

Does anybody have any ideas as to what the problem could be?
Does anybody have the address of a rebuilder near Northern California?

Thanks,

Dan Evans
