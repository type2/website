&gt; If you have the old one you can make a new one via the
&gt; paper mache method.  Line the old one with saran wrap. Shred cardboard or
&gt; newspaper and put it in a bucket of water till it is mush.
&gt; Spread the mush over the saran wrap in the old one then let
&gt; dry (in the sun if available). After it is dry smooth with
&gt; light sanding if desired... spray with clear seal or krylon


Or just get a new one from me for under $20.
It's plastic rather than cardboard, so it should be the last one you ever
have to buy. Old one comes out with two screws (or falls out in chunks as
the case may be :-), new one pops in just as quickly, and you're done.
