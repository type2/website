Subject: 79 FI will not start

Greetings all,

I acquired a 79 westy this weekend that according to the PO was running 
fine then just quit.  I have checked the usual suspects, replacing the 
fuel filter (it was pluged) cleaning and testing the fuel pump (I put 
it in my adventurewagen and it works great) and checking for spark, etc.

Still, I do not have it running.  I noticed that it makes a loud 
buzzing noise when the key is turned on.  I thought it was the fuel 
pump but the noise did not follow the pump to the adventurewagen.  I 
don't think I am getting fuel to the injectors.

I was wondering where I can obtain a fuel pressure gauge.  Also I am 
wondering how to proceed.

Any help is appreciated.

Thanks,

Dave
