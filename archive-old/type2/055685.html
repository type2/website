Probably True for authenticity sake.

BUT

the newer seats (68-79) appear to fit nicely in a '67.

I'm living proof!  They may not be exactly correct, but they are usually
cheaper to find.

I'm not sure when the floor pattern changed...'65?

yes the seats are interchangable interms of being able to be bolted in, I
think you could put a bay seat in a barndoor FWIW.   In terms of authenticity,
a 67 is one year only.     I have a couple bay middle seats as carport
furniture.  One is a 68 one year only, or maybe 68-69, with tan vinyl and the
arm faces one way.  The other is later with black vinyl upholstery, and the
arm goes the other way.   If someone really wants one, I may be convinced to
part, but I live near Seattle, so think about shipping.
