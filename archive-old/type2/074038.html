Subject: Re: [T2] that hole ain't supposed to be there!

Thanks for all the ideas!  I will take a look at it again and I don't
think I'll have a problem getting the wrist pin out now!

Now, on to the next problem.  I'm going to need to get a new piston and
cylinder.  Do I have to replace both 3 &amp; 4, or can I just replace 4? 
Plus, I can't read the piston labels (size, weight) because it's all
black on the the surface of both of the pistons that I have access to. 
What should I do?

Thanks for the advice!

Mike
