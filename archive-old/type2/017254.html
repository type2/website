Subject: Clutch Cover Question?

Hellooo Volks,

I have a little question concerning Clutch Covers.  I have a '71 Westy
&quot;Janis&quot; and recently the clutch has started slipping in third going up
hill and if the clutch cable is tightened up it wouldn't slip but it
would be a booger getting into gear, 1st and Rev mostly, also it would
urge forward while starting with clutch fully engaged.

So I pull the engine to exchange clutch cover and put in new disk (which
was very worn).  Here is where the Clutch Cover question comes in, the
old cover's springs have a higher profile pt#113 141 025.1 than the
replacement cover pt#113 141 025.4 ,  Was the difference in prior
performance due to the combination of higher springs and disk or did the
diff. in hights contribute to the detriment of the disk?????   I'd very
much like to know before I put it back in and just see what that diff.
means in real time.

May the busma provide the answer!
