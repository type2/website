Subject: Carb flooding!

Good day guys, on this beautiful (NOT!) first real winter day!!!
http://pages.infinit_dot_net/engine/test/hivert1.jpg  (over 15in of that
dam* white S**T, soory!)

After i rebuilt
http://www.letambourin_dot_com/west_carbu_rebuilt1.htm
my /$%$/% Solex Carbs i was thinking that i should be OK for a wile!
Well, Not!!!

I just found out this weekend (before we had this beautiful  Snow, NOT!)
that my carbs where flooding each time i was stopping the engine for a
few minutes when the engine was warm (no problem when cold), I didn't
know at the time that the carbs were flooding, just that the bus was
very dificult to start when warm!!! But when i removed the air filter
housing (i was stuck at the corner store-engine was flooded) saturday, i
saw that the carbs (mostly the right one) were dripping fuel from:
http://pages.infinit_dot_net/engine/test/carb201.jpg
Those 2 location for at least 1 minute (engine stop and fuel line
disconnected) resulting in an engine flooding!!!!!!! (like i said,
mostly the right one).

Any advise on that matter? (This didn't happen right after i rebuil the
carb!!!! just lately)

Secondly, i am tired of those carb and i wil buy new one, probably the
Dual Weber 34mm, i don't see any other brands out there and i don't want
any used one!!
My questions:
-Can i use the stock distributor with the Weber carbs
-do those one have a nipple for the advance vacuum.
-Are they calibrated for the stock distributor
-If not, which distributor would work with those carbs (050!).
-Do you have any other suggestions for NEW carbs

Thanks guys.
Ben (the snow man)
