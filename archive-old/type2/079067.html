Subject: tonneau cover info

Gentlepersons-
                       Any of you DIY-ers out there know of a reference/how-to
book on making a bed cover for a single cab and a &quot;tonneau cover&quot; for a
KG...Even if it's not VW-specific, that's fine. Just looking for general dir-
ections on fittings, measuring, tips, etc. I have one book on reupholster-
ing and directions like &quot;.._dot_carefully cut the old one apart to use as a pat-
tern&quot; aren't helpful when starting from scratch...
TIA.
