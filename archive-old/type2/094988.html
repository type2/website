Subject: Question #3 Starting and resin

O.K. were getting close to a great running bus I just have two more 
questions. :) First one is quite often when I try to start it everything 
looks fine, oil and alt lights come on then when I turn the key to pos 3 it 
clicks and everything goes dead. No radio...alt or oil pressure 
lights...nothing. I go to the back and give the main battery wire a little 
tug, go back and everything fires right up. Do you think it's just a battery 
connection or something else I don't know about?

#2 When I got the van there was an exhaust leak that pretty much was pumping 
the exhaust into the engine intake. Everything was like a well used pipe in 
there...lots of sticky oil (if only it was the right kind) Filters been 
changed (was absolutly horrible) and I cleaned what I could get from 
throttle body but there is some sort of air flow sensor right after the air 
box. What is the best way to clean this without damaging it? What would it 
make my engine do if it was covered with crap?

Thanks for reading and any suggestions. Oh it's a '75 Westy.
Jon
