&gt; Dear List,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm posting this for a friend.  About a year ago after doing a trip with me 
&gt; in my 79 Westfalia he decided to sell his Toyota van and stumbled across a 
&gt; running 78 Champaign Edition Westfalia at a good price. Since then he's put 

&gt; the head?? But its winter and its been a number of years since I've had an 
&gt; engine that far apart.
&gt; For the curious Logan Utah is about 90 miles north a Salt Lake.


when I was desperate some years ago I picked up a working 1700/1800 from a
411/412 at a salvage yard, these engines are similar enough that they can
be swapped and people don't seem to price them anywhere near as high, 
  did have to swap the FI system between the engines but that was a couple
hour job, otherwise it just bolted in and worked fine until I could get my
engine rebuilt
