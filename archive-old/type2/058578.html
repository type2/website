If you're going to this much trouble, then you should finish the job.  
The smoking lamp is out for this entire procedure!

Run the tank dry, put in just enough to get home, then drive home. 
Alternatively, you can just syphon the fuel out at home.

Put on old clothes, have a bucket handy, and crawl under the tank.

Disconnect the rubber hose, let the residual fuel drain into the bucket.

Unscrew the big nut around the fuel outlet and pull the finger screen
out of the tank.  Clean the screen.

Put the bucket where it will catch the gas and pour a couple of
gallons into the filler.  The idea here is that you want to flush out
the tank, so you have to pour the gas into the filler rapidly.  Don't
just trickle it in.

Let the rust settle out of the gas in the bucket, pour off the clean
gas, and clean the spooge out of the bucket.

Put the bucket under the tank again and run the clean gas through the
tank again.  Repeat until no more grunge comes out of the tank.

Replace the screen and outlet, attach the hose (time for replacement?)
and motor on.

The gas you used to rinse the tank should _not_ be used in an engine. 
It'll make good &quot;liquid boy scout&quot; for the next few campfires or
barbeques or can be used for desert candles.  Use common sense here,
of course!
