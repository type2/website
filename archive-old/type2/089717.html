By the time you getdone rigging up this off the wall inetrior cooling
system, you could have bought a nice nostalgic Swamp cooler out of E-Bay
at a quarter of the price and aggravation.

Plug in and go---simple, and a  done deal--

&lt;&lt; Take a medium-small sized heavily insulated cooler (6 or 12 pack
size?), possibly one of the new ones that have a DC powered cooling
plate? Install a cheap 6-8 pass transmission/oil/or motorcycle radiator
block style cooler on the lid. Mount one or two 12V high output computer
case fans (or DC car fans of some sort) either right on the radiator, or
at one end of a custom housing to force the air through the radiator.
Run vinyl or silicone tubing from the radiator through holes in the lid
(sealed around edges with expanda-foam), one for intake, one for return.
buy a cheap aquarium or marine bilge pump that runs on 12V DC and use
that to circulate the cold water through the radiator. &gt;&gt; 
That DC cooling plate is gonna heat the bus (ask Maxwell's Imp ;-) I
tend to think that there just isn't enough mass in the ice to cool much.
Try an experiment...Fill the cooler with ice and put it in a closed bus
with a thermostat hanging from something. Leave the cooler open and see
if the temperature of the interior goes down by much...
