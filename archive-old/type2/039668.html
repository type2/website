Subject: Re: Cup Holders in Bus 

Now see, here in Florida, we jus' hold them sodas 'tween our legs as we 
drive, and that serves as both cup holder, and a/c. Or maybe that should 
be,&quot;there conditioner&quot; huh?  And, when some bozo cuts you off, and ya spill 
the darn thing, it jus runs down your leg and cools yer hot feet. And rinses 
out your footwells. Aint science grand?
