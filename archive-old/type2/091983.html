(Re my tightening lugnut sequence)  This is done in 2 stages,

&gt; 
&gt; I actually do it in three stages, one to snug up the nut, one to get it
&gt; tight then I lower the wheel onto the ground some and really get it socked
&gt; down tight.

OK, I forgot to mention I lower the car and then do the &quot;sock it
tight&quot;....wound never do that on the jack....But the sequence does
insure the rim centers into the tapered nuts, and I often go back to #1
to check it's drawn up.
