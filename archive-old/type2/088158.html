Subject: Re: [T2] Shocks

[...]

Try NAPA......   75598 for coil-overs or MA758 if you want air shocks.....

&gt; My rear shocks are shot, but I've been unable to find any replacements...the
&gt; ones installed by the PO were coil-overs.  I've considered using stock
&gt; shocks and possibly adjusting the torsion bars BUT the wheels on my bus are
&gt; apparently larger-diameter Audi wheels.  Since the shocks have to replaced
&gt; anyway, buying coil-overs would save me the trouble of doing the torsion
&gt; bars, and I'm afraid that the larger wheels might require the coil-overs to
&gt; maintain clearance...any comments on my thought process here?  Anybody know
&gt; where coil-over shocks might be had?
