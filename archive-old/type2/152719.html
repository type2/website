Subject: Re: [T2] FS: Locking Engine Hatch Handle for '68-'71 Bus

Several years ago these were brought in by an importer and *improperly*
identified and marked as 211 827 503 D (Maybe they work on Brazil Type 2
Engine Lids, who knows?). In actuality, these are 113 898 503 A (sometimes
sold as 113 827 503 A). These fit 65-66 Beetle Decklids and 66 Only Type 2
Engine Lids.
 How do I know? I got stuck with a HUGE box of them several years ago and
the outfit I got them from went belly up. I must have 3 or 4 dozen of these
lying around in the box somewhere. I figured someday I'd dig them out.
 CIP has oodles of them at $15.95:
http://www2.cip1_dot_com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=VWC%2D113%2D827%2D503%2DA
 The difference between the Engine Lid Latch/Locks:
 113 827 503 A = Bug 65-66, Bus 66 Only. When the screws are removed, falls
apart into a bunch separate components just like the Original VW German
ones. These from Brazil are actually put together quite well. NOT
interchange w/113 827 503 F.
 113 827 503 F = Bug 67-71, Bus 67 Only. 3 Screw style similar to the 503 A,
but one piece and is NOT interchangeable w/503 A.
 113 827 503 H = Bug 72-79. 1 Screw Style. If replacing Rear Decklid w/new
current Brazilian on 68-71 models, you must use this Latch/Lock. Although
not correct for it, it will work on 68-71 Bus in place of the 211 827 503 D.
The difference between the original Bus style and this one is that the
finger pull is slightly shorter on the Bus one.
 211 827 503 L = Type 2 72-79. 1 Screw Style. Only fits this application.
Originally available in Chrome, VW went to Black in later years and as the
replacement offered until recently by VW for the outrageous price of around
$90! &quot;L&quot; was locking and although the fiche doesn't show it, I have seen NOS
in the box 211 827 503 K as the non-locking variety.
 The REAL 211 827 503 D was discontinued by VOA early this year and the
price was $86.15. I've never seen a Mexican or Brazilian version of this
Latch/Lock.

&gt; I mistakenly bought a locking engine hatch handle for a '68-'71 bus
&gt; several

&gt; The part number is 211827503D. It attaches with three screws, not with
&gt; just
&gt; one, as in the later buses. It comes with two keys. It's brand new, never
&gt; used.
