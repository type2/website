Greetings all,

I've a 77 Riviera with dual batteries, I have been having some issues with.
I have replaced both batteries and still have the same problem. The auto
zone guys checked the alternator with there fancy lil machine and tell me it
fine. So here is my problem....the bus starts fine, blinkers work, head
lights work, but If I have the lights on the blinkers are slow, if the light
are on the hazard lights wont come on. If the lights are off the hazards
will come on. So it seems I don't have enough power to run all of these at
the same time.

Do I need a new regultor? or could it been some thing else? Tiss the first
bus that I am trying to work on myself so IM on a steep learning curve, any
thoughts would be great.
