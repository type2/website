&gt; &gt; This time a year ago, we were trying to find a bus to buy and

&gt;I think it may be a momentary blip on the nation in general, what with
&gt;high fuel prices, the Hurricane, being bogged down in Iraq and the time of

I spent a month or so looking for a VW bus or Vanagon (The Samba- WA 
&amp; OR, craigslist_dot_org- Seattle &amp; Portland and all the papers want 
ads). I was not going to spend thousands on it either. I'm not a 
collector, I wasn't looking for an investment. I just wanted to drive 
a VW again.
I was truly amazed at what some people wanted for a 25+ year old 
vehicle that had not been started in years, had peeling paint, rust 
holes and &quot;I&quot; had to pull the mouse nests out of the engine 
compartment (the mouse used the insulation from the engine cover). I 
saw this 'type' of VW more than once. I stopped looking at those when 
I realized they were asking those prices because they honestly 
thought they would get that kind of money.

When you get past the investment/classic mentality we are talking 
about basic transportation. Classy transportation but a transporter 
none-the-less. &lt;shrug&gt;.
The '91 Grand Caravan I drove for over a year (over 200k miles and 
the engine gave out, I traded it for a tow to the wrecking yard) was 
more comfortable that my Vanagon, got better gas mileage too. I could 
camp in it or carry sheets of plywood or all the kids. It did not 
have the room the Vanagon has, the visibility or give &quot;me&quot; the good 
feeling I get from driving my VW.

Over the course of that year I had less money in the Caravan than I 
spent buying my Vanagon.
I wanted to buy an air-cooled VW, I tried to buy an '80 that had a 
bad head but the guy was too busy to find the time to take my money. 
I ended up spending $800 on an '87 with 216k miles on it. I drove it 
home and have been driving it since than. It's had some head work 
done and has a few other problems but it's a VW and it's basic 
transportation. It was a fair price (IMO) for what I got. I have had 
to do some minor work to it &amp; have more to do still.

I took a look at the '78 in question. With the asking price of $4k I 
wouldn't have even bothered to send an e-mail. It's a 27 year old 
air-cooled VW Transporter.
At $1.5k I'd have written you, the 500 miles was not too far to go to 
get one but I wouldn't have gone past $1k. It's just not worth more 
than that to me for something to drive. Even if it is a VW.

But that's me... I suspect that if you wait long enough you'll get 
close to what you are asking. That's the same thing I said to the guy 
with the '79 that had orange paint showing where the blue peeled off 
and the mice nests in the engine compartment.

I've had the '87 for 3 weeks now and love driving a VW again!
