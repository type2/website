Subject: Leaky Doors???

Ok, sorry for all the e-mails. 

	One more question... I have all the proper window gaskets and such
installed on the front doors. Now, my question is.. that after the REALLY
REALLY heavy rain storm, I noticed a little bit of water starting to pool at
the bottom of the doors (I have no door panels so I can look inside). Now...
I DO have the door gaskets installed, and they're installed pretty well too
and definitely keep a good seal. I was wondering if... it wouldn't be a good
idea for me to drill maybe 1 or 2 small holes in the bottom of the door so
that the water could drain out if any happens to get in there? Is this a bad
idea? I would of course sand the area down, and re-paint the inside of the
holes, etc. It would be to prevent the base of the door from rusting now.

You could say.. &quot;well, the door has lasted this long without rust... what
makes you think you need to do this now?&quot; well, the way I see it.. my
finacee loves this car, and I seriously doubt she's EVER going to get rid of
it. She keeps a picture of it in her purse to show her friends and
co-workers. So, I'd like to do whatever I can to make it last for a LONG
time.


Thanks,
