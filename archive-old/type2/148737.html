Subject: 73 alternator testing / removal?

alternator is not charging. Light on the
dash is ON....
 How can I test voltage regulator and alternator?
 How do I remove the alternator? Does the engine
need to be removed from the vehicle? I looked
in the VW manual. It shows parts breakdown,
but not removal instruction. There is one bolt
that goes into the &quot;adjuster&quot; side, and a nut/bolt
that goes on the &quot;pivot&quot; side of the alternator...
it looks like there is some tin in the way. If it
comes out underneith the motor, I'll need to
remove the heater box/exhaust/ some tin. If
it will come up from the top, it looks like some
tin needs to be removed.
 any tips?
 thanks, Jen
