Subject: [T2] Brake Drum Puller

Yes, a brake drum puller really does exist - I have one. Can't imagine why
you can't find one. The guys at your local FLAPS are idiots.
It's a very simple, effective tool. It is simply a 1/2&quot; metal rod about 1'
long with a handle and a 2&quot; long piece of 1&quot; bar welded at 90 degrees to the
rod. The business end is threaded to accept either a seal puller or the drum
remover, which looks like a small curved spade with the tip bent over. To
use it, you simply place the bent end over the drum flange and pound on the
crosspiece with your big hammer. Keep turning the drum as you do this, or
move the tool around the rim. Works like a charm, but takes a while.
BTW, a slide hammer of a good size could also probably be modified to work.
