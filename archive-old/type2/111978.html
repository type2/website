Subject: hubcap question

ok, prior to me buying a 69 single cab a couple of months
ago, i had always had the later bays with the 'regular'
hubcaps.

but now of course i have the 'wide 5' pattern with the half-
moon hubcaps. this might seem like a stupid question, but
how are those little tabs that hold the hubcaps on
repaired?

i polished my new/used hubcaps last night &amp;
one of my rims has 2 of those little tabs missing so the
hubcap won't stay on.

thanks in advance,

Joel Wilson
