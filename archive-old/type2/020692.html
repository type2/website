Subject: My experience with a published internet list

This is for Steve G, K. Hooper and the general list:
Sorry to take up list wandwidth, but I speak with some authority here.
A number of years ago, I was active as a contributor to a Compuserve
forum or bulletin board dealing with ADD (attention deficit disorder). 
One had to sign on to join the forum.  Obviously Compusere owned the
forum.
Sundry experts were also on that list, and were influential in getting
Compuserve to publish the forum as a book for the benefit of others
influenced or plagued by ADD. The money generated presumably went to ADD
research and keep &quot;experts&quot; available to the list.  Everyone who was in
that book had to be contacted and first agree to have their words
published, for which our &quot;pay&quot; was a free copy of the book.  
   The bottom line is that a mailing list is like a bulletin board,
where all who have access (sign up) get to see what is on the list and
what everyone else wrote.  If experts join and write in, then they are
donating their experience for the benefit of the list.  The bulletin
board is owned by those who erected it.  An archive is like taking
pictures every time you refresh a bulletin board and leaving those
pictures in a book.
   We may own our words, but those who set up the mechanics of the list
really do own the &quot;book&quot;.   They have the right to allow it to be
accessible to the members of the list and even the general public if on
a web site.  If they give it to someone to keep on a site, he does not
&quot;own&quot; it.  If he makes copies of that &quot;book&quot; or archive and sells it,
then that is publishing.  Yes, we have the right to have our words
removed for any reason, be it fear of others profiting by them (ie,
Hoover's sermons) or we may think we were wrong in the past. 
Fine........Now Steve, why offer to even sell the information on the
list, unless you can argue it's to help computerless persons- in which
case we can argue it was our sweat to create that list and we are
entitled to a cut of the profits, or see insurance that the monies go to
say, keeping the hardware working and recompense some time to the
administrators.  You really can't proceed to publication without getting
the permission of first, the owner(s) and then every contributor.
