Subject: Later front disc brakes in a 70 bus?

I'm considering returning to the aircooled ranks with
the purchase of a 70 westy.  Just wondering about
those drums up front.  Is it possible to swap front
discs out of a later bus?  Need whole front end,
master cyl, some way to tap vacuum, right?  Any
hangups with this?  Rear brake circuits compatible?  

Thanks,
Das Kapitan
