Subject: RE: [T2] brief trip report - norcal

I just love these bus stories that Type2 folk (or &quot;volk,&quot; right?) 
occasionally send the rest of us.  Whether about how one bought or stumbled 
across a bus or is excited about his/her new bus, about childhood memories 
of being in a bus, or about the details of trips such as this latest one in 
San Fran...I've so far really enjoyed everyone's unique writing styles &amp; 
perspectives!  Keep 'em coming and thanks a lot for sharing.
