&gt; I have 2 Eberspacher BA6 gas heaters with ALL the components (no swap area
&gt; mystery heaters that are missing 90% of their parts - these are complete) total
&gt; cost to me: 50 bucks each.   They are what the VW buses originally came with if
&gt; ordered with an auxillary heater booster from the dealer.  I personally have
&gt; been in a friend of mine's stationary, engine stopped, '76 Westy last winter in
&gt; 15 degree temps here in Allentown, Pa, with the BA6 gas heater running and it
&gt; was *very toasty* inside the bus. Almost to the point that it was too warm.  the
&gt; gas heater had been running for approx 2 hours (even tho the bus warmed up
&gt; nicely within 4or 5 min. of turning that little green temp. knob on the dash)
&gt; and there was NO exhaust smell and there was only the quiet whirring of the
&gt; furnace under the bus. I almost fell asleep, if I hadn't a class to go to! My
&gt; buddy has used it NUMEROUS times while camping at night, turning the knob and
&gt; letting the timer run while he was sleeping.  And he's not dead yet! they are
&gt; just as safe or safer to use while sleeping as a propane heater is!  With a gas
&gt; heater you don't have to go thru the trouble of locating a tank, and figuring
&gt; out where to mount it as you do on the propane heaters, and you never have to
&gt; worry about running out of fuel (for the most part, unless you are a person who
&gt; drives around on empty all the time) Or constantly checking &amp; refilling the
&gt; propane tank.  If you have gasoline in your gas tank then your heater will run.
&gt; Simple.  The Eberspachers are very safety engineered, there are quite a few
&gt; cutoff switches in the event of  malfunction. And the whole unit mounts under
&gt; the center of your bus, out of the way - not under the back seat taking up much
&gt; needed storage space like a propane heater would.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not biased, I'm just warm......gas heaters - safe, practical, the way to go!
&gt; 
&gt; chris         I looked at a 72 Weasty that was for sale and noticed the
gas heater was located in the engine compartment at the left rear 
corner.
        Is this a normal mounting location? Peace Phil
