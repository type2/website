Subject: Re: Brakes

&gt;  What about Porsche 944 brakes? 
&gt;  They are popular with the Super Beetle crowd because they are pretty much
a bolt-on upgrade. Due to the similarity in rear axle design at least the
rear discs might be an option for a bus maybe even the front ones.
&gt;  I have been thinking about this myself but have not done any field
research on it yet. I use my camper to tow car trailers (up to 1.6 tons) and
at times the stock brakes seem to be insufficient for that.

thats not a bad idea...the only draw back i can see (at least trying to
visualize the process in my head) would be that you would need to also use
the porsche wheels to bolt up to the 944 rear disc brake assembly.  or does
a pors. wheel fit the late bays?  having rear discs would be a step in the
right direction.
