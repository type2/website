Subject: I need 1.8l or 2.0l heads

X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

If you read my previous post you know that I got the short end of the stick
on a motor, so now I need to find a set of 2.0l or 1.8l heads. They need not
be new, just useable. That means with out the valve sucked up in the head. I
would love to buy just one good 2.0l 1979-83 head, I have the heat
exchangers for that kind. If I get 1.8l or 76-78 2.0l heads I will need
different heat exchangers. If anyone can help me with this, let me know.
