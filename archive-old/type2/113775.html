Ron helps remind us that businesses are run by real people, just like 
everyone else on this list. While it is a part of business to lose money on 
bad luck every now and then, it still sucks every bit as bad as anyone else 
that experiences bad luck. Sometimes we forget that and look at a business 
as a THING and not a group of people trying to make a living. As a business 
owner sometimes you need to vent a little and you'd like people to at least 
hear your pain a little bit. That's what everyone else, including myself, 
does on this list....look for a little support every now and then and some 
good ears to listen.

My company experienced flooding a few months back and we ended up having to 
move to another building. This is the busiest time of the year for us so it 
was real bad timing. While we were able to keep things together like Ron is 
doing, it cost us some money. I hope OUR customers are able to appreciate 
the fact that we worked hard to keep from having our bad luck affect them.

Being a VW business Ron, I know most of your customers, while they may be a 
little dissapointed, will appreciate the fact that you are working your 
best to have your troubles not affect your original aggreement with them as 
customers.

Hang in there buddy.
