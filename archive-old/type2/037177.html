Subject: Re: Type 4 conversion

&gt;Has anyone ever put a type 4 (72 and later) engine into a pre 72 type 1 Bus?
&gt;What is needed to mount it in the Bus?
&gt;E-mail replies would be appreciated!

Unless you have a good knowledge of metal working equipment including
welding, fabricating the needed parts and replacing the sheetmetal will be
very difficult.

The rear &quot;frame&quot; that is under the sheetmetal at the back (your bumper
attaches to this frame) is wider after '71 so the wider type 4 engine will
fit in there.  I don't know if you would have to widen the frame, but you
would have to cut all the sheet metal out of one bus, then weld it in the
other, then fabricate the mounts for the engine brace.

You can figure at least 40 to 60 hours to do a decent, workable job if you
have done this type of work before.

A lot of work.  Not worth it in my opion.  The type 1 engine will work fine
and your resale value will not drop.
