&gt; Mufflers? He said, veery slowly, yes, we do. I pondered this for a moment,
&gt; and asked the inevitable question: do you guarantee them for life? He
&gt; paused, looking unhappy, and answered slowly, yes. I asked how much and he
&gt; said $100. (how much is a bus muffler german issue for a 68-71? About $90) I
&gt; thought to myself gold mine! Ok I don't have a bug. I have a bus, I don't
&gt; like mechanics, I do it all myself, but what if they could do the work for
&gt; me?


The only catch here is that they only gaurantee the 'muffler' but not the
gaskets, clamps, tailpipes, or labor. Miraculously, the cost of those add up
to about $100 if you come in for warantee work.
