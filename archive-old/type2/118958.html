Subject: Confederation Bridge Crossing

I was watching the live video from the Confederation Bridge website today at
2:25 EST and thought I saw a splittie crossing the bridge.  The video wasn't
all that clear, and it jumped just as the vehicle got close.  Wild snow
storm, though.

Was any listee on the bridge traveling from New Brunswick to Prince Edward
island (or vice versa, I don't know which camera they're using for the
website, or which direction it facing.  The bridge appears to curve to the
right in the video.)
