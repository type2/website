I'm new to the list and have been doing some research. Just bought a 73 =
bus...and everything I read seems to be about repairing them. One story =
recounted - as almost miraculous -  driving 2,000 miles without a major =
problem. What's the scoop? Am I going to have to get into the Tao of VW =
repair or go nuts in denial (turn the radio up when I hear a noise, take =
it to car wash when it seems to be over heating, etc.?)    Trudell
