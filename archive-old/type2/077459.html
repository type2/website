For the information of whom ever can use this information. There are a lot of 
insurance company's out there that will pay to have your winshield replaced 
(because of the safety factor), with out paying the deductable or reflection 
on your premium. Just plain out right free. It varies from state to state and 
different insurance companies. Check with your insurance company for their 
policy. I've done it twice on two different cars. I've had other friends do 
the same, I've also had some say their insurance companies would not do it. 
So ya have a could or could not possibility, let the insurance company tell 
ya no instead of assuming they won't, and with the money saved, tint them.
