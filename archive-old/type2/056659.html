Subject: FS 70 Bus

I posted this a week or so ago.  I am hoping to sell this bus intact.
The body in in great shape, minus some surface rust.  If I can't sell it
in a week or so I'll post it elsewhere and then part it out.  Which I
really don't want to do.

It is a 70 bus.  Original green paint.
No engine, late model tranny.  If not needed I'll drop $200 of price and
remove.
Use to be a daily driver, about 4 years ago.  Been parked since then.
Only to small dents in rear corner.
Brakes work, with the exception of 2 wheel cylinders which need
replacing.
Rear seat folds out to a bed.
Has a full length middle seat, in excellent condition
Both front seats are in excellent condition.
Everything else works
Clean interior, all good glass.

I was planing on restore it myself till I saw a 72 westy I just had to
have.  Now this needs to go
in order to replentish my checking account

I'm asking 1000 w/tranny, $800 without.
Of course price in negotiable.

I live in Annapolis, Maryland.

Brent
