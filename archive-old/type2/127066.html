Subject: 68-69 column/ignition parts

hello, 

does anyone have a 68 or 69 they are parting out? 

i need some steering column parts: 
-lock cylinder (need key too, but thats ok if you don't have it) 
-ignition switch housing

also i'm trying to find the exact part #'s so if anyone knows what they
are that would be a huge help! 

apparently these are 68-69 only parts. Buddah is giving me spare parts from a 72 
that will probably work in a pinch, but i'd rather find the exact, correct 
parts if possible. 

please help &amp; thanks!

parts! you guys rock. i would definitely recommend them to any bus driver.
