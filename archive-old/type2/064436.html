Subject: Re: air-conditioning for a '71?

&gt;There is a company in your area called International Conditioning Enter-
&gt;prises that specializes in airconditioning for bugs/buses and squarebacks.
&gt;Here's their address:
&gt;
&gt;              International Conditioning Enterprises (I.C.E.)

        When I spoke to ICE on the phone about 1.5 yrs ago, they said they
wouldn't sell a package for the bus. There was a fellow around Houston who
would, but his price was around $1600, a little steep for my tastes. So I
sweat.

        Around the same time I got ahold of some information from the
National Renewable Resources Lab (URL at my home page) about using
evaporative cooling in humid environments. If someone has time, desire, and
a little manufacturing know-how, a workable system might be designed. I
have all but time... A company already markets these type of systems, but
they make them for *real* busses, not our little ol VW's. Someday I may
have the time, but if someone else wanted to do the hard work, I wouldn't
complain...   ;-)

Peace,
