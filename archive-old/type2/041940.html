Subject: Wanted to Buy: rebuilt 205S dizzy

Hey there Volks,

I'm having a problem with my 022-905-205S dizzy (aka 0231-170-093),
and although I intend to rebuild the upper end (thanks for the tips
Steve), I'm wondering if someone can direct me to a source of a
rebuilt one. This dizzy came stock on 76-78, and 79 FED 2.0L type2's.

For those who are interested, details on this dizzy can be found
here:

I've heard rebuilt dizzys can be bought for $90, but I can't find
one. The local VWFLAPS say new _at_ $400, (busdepot has 'em for $338 new
- no rebuilt ones), so I'm hoping I can get a rebuilt one. 

I'd like to put a rebuilt in there for now, so I can drive the bus
while I play with the old dizzy. If I can somehow take the original
apart, clean and grease it, *and* put it back together correctly,
I'll have a spare too. (fyi - points plate is stuck/binding, not the
vac diaphram leaking).

Thanks in advance,
