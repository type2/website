Subject: Re: trailer hitch - bay windows

I just checked out there site and they have 1973 up listed, but none for 
1972 on down. I just emailed them to see if they could produce one and if 
so, maybe we could get a list together and see how many folks would want one 
and maybe get a discount of some sort since they might have to design one.

THere site is:

http://www.hitch-web_dot_com/dalan.asp

Email them with the same interest and maybe they will get the hint to 
produce what we need.

&gt;Better yet, contact Da'lan company directly, and get the hitch a bit
&gt;cheaper.
&gt;
&gt;Better, better yet, ask the lovely lady at Da'lan about distributors.
&gt;She will give you a name/number, and the distributor will look the hitch
&gt;up in their catalog, and the distributor will offer it at a discount,
&gt;somewhere in the neighborhood of $87 plus shipping.  (Da'lan says that
&gt;they cannot offer a discount because they are using (a) distributor, and
&gt;would be undercutting.)
&gt;
&gt;However, Da'lan offers free shipping.
&gt;
&gt;But, of course, you may not get the RMMW 'lifetime' guarantee..!!!
&gt;
&gt;BTW, if you ask the lovely lady why she is not using the '009
&gt;distributor, she may not get the joke!!.
&gt;
&gt;[[  do an 'altavista' search on    +&quot;trailer hitch&quot; +dalan   and see
&gt;what you get.  ]]
