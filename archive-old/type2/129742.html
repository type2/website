Mike, would you be so kind as to describe your megasquirt setup?  Are 
you using a mix of L-Jet parts along with something else?

Megasquirt is MAP-based, not AF-based, right?  Using a stock plenum 
modified to handle the meqasquirt sensors?  Using stock Bosch injectors 
on stock intake runners?  If the AFM is not used by the megasquirt, did 
you remove it from the air intake or just leave it in place?  How did 
you mount the O2 sensor?

This is mostly a learning exercise for me -- I'm currently quite happy 
with my stock L-Jet.. but megasquirt is interesting from a &quot;build a 
dream engine&quot; perspective, so I'd like to hear about the particulars 
from someone who's actually built one with it :-)
