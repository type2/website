Subject: Re: to buy the '71 or not to buy

what he is talking about is the 'horns' that the beetle, and split window
busses have that suport the transmission, which in turn holds up the
engine.......  which the early bays do not have....  to use a beetle engine
you must use the oil pump adaptor, for the rear mount which has mixed revues
about it's use.......

&gt; Owner doesn't know what he is talking about.  '71s came with type 1
&gt; motors from the factory.  The owner probably thinks that it should have
&gt; a type IV engine.
