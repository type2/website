&gt;Cold and hot idle!!!
&gt;
&gt;When it's cold, say sitting for a couple of hours, etc. it fires right
&gt;up but idles at about 600 RPM.  Then, after a couple minutes, when it's
&gt;hot, the RPM climbs to about 1100RPM.  The AUX air vlalve seems to
&gt;be OK.  I took it out cold and put 12V across the terminals and the
&gt;little slide closed in it.
&gt;
&gt;Any ideas? &lt;G&gt;


 Un plug your cold start and see if the idle stablizes.  If so check your
Thermo Time Switch.  If not it still may be that your cold start is
leaking.  Undo the tubes leading to it and by pass the cold start to see if
this corrects it.

Test with a warm engine.

Have fun
