Subject: Re: [T2] Snake oil cooling info???

Bill sends:

&gt; 2. On an older topic of cooling - I recently read again (somewhere I can't
&gt; remember) that the cast aluminum valve covers will help keep the engine cooler
&gt; than original covers.  I also remember in a forum that someone said the
&gt; original valve covers worked just as well and that the cork gaskets served to
&gt; insulate the cover from much of the engine heat.

They might help keep the lifters cooler than the original covers, but that's
about all I can think of. Like the forum said, those cork gaskets are good
insulators.

You install cast aluminum valve covers because you think they make your
engine look good. There's nothing wrong with that, and if they're well made
they won't hurt anything by being there, but that's why you get them.
Because they're pretty.
