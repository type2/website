Subject: Re: [T2] Still seeking 71 bus air preheat stovepipe

Hiya Mike,

The stovepipe has not been a hard item for me to find.  If you have turned up 
high and dry in your search you might want to consider doing business with an 
online boneyard like Way-Out down in Arkansas.  Zillions of parts and nice 
people with which to deal.

By the way, you might luck out and get one in pretty good condition, but it's 
been my experience that these things are usually pretty well banged up or oil 
soaked.  Or both.  I'd be happy with it if the insulating (asbestos?) jacket 
is in reasonably good shape.

Mike
