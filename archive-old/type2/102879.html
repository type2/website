Subject: A real offbeat question

Hi all:

I was cleaning up the fan housing and cooling air control flaps for the
engine I'm going to install in the Westy and I noticed that the right flap
(passenger's side) had a rubber &quot;plug&quot; in it.  Looking at another set of
flaps I have I saw that on that set the rubber plug was missing, leaving a
hole in the flap about 1/2&quot; in diameter.

Does anybody know what purpose that rubber plug in the flap serves?

(Told you it was a real offbeat question.)
