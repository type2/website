Subject: Backup lights...the continuing saga

OK, I crawled under the bus this weekend and found a sensor/switch, on the 
right side of the trans. just above and a little forward of the pan. 
However, I did not find or see a black wire with an in-line fuse to attach. 
What I did find are two wires that are not connected to anything, a gray or 
white one that was taped off at the end, and a blue and red stripped one 
that has a rubber cap over the end.

I called a local VW shop and was told that there 'is not' a switch on the 
trans. for the backup lights. The switch that controls the backup lights is 
in the shifter 'box'.

So my questions are:

     1.  What are those 2 wires supposed to be connected to?
                         (the white or gray and the red and blue stripped 
ones)

     2.  What is the sensor/switch on the side of the trans. for?
                         (it is not connected to anything, but should it 
be?)

This vehicle is a '75 bus with an automatic.

                    Pete
