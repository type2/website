Hi all. It's been a while since I've had anything worthwhile to post, but I've
been out here faithfully lurking none the less:-&gt;
I'm finally getting off my lazy butt and finishing up the resto on my 71 bus.
I've had the outside done for about 5 years and have procrastinated about the
interior
until now. Seems it was always too hot, too cold, or I had too many beers. Out
of fear of all my new rubber dry rotting while siting in the garage, motivation
has finally struck. In the last 2 days I have charged my batteries, installed
the electrical portion of my ignition switch (was going to do the mechanicals as
well but couldn't figure out how to remove it. Manual didn't help. Found out
afterwards that I didn't need to), had new keys made, and reinstalled the fuse
block where it is suppose to go (was just hanging there.) Which brings me to my
reason for posting in the first place. Does anyone out there in &quot;Type 2 Land&quot;
have a spare cover for a 71 fuse block? I checked Ron's site but it looked as
though they stopped at 1970. If ya got one you can spare please p-mail me:

Thanks a bunch,
Tim
