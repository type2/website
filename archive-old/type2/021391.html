Subject: buying a bus and bringing it to CA

Does anyone have any experience on this subject?  I'm considering
purchasing a bus from Washington state and I just started thinking about
the smog requirements for CA.  
The current owner said that it is not a CA bus, yet it does have a newly
rebuilt engine (7000mi) so it shouldn't be too difficult to get it &quot;into
tune&quot; for CA.  (it's a 78 btw)  It does not, however, have a catalytic
converter, nor would it have the EGR (right?) but the guy didn't check
for it on mine when I got my current bus smogged in CA.  Do non-CA buses
have different requirements in CA?

I do have a 76 with a cat on it, so I guess I could swap the exhausts
because they are compatible.  I wonder how much of a pain in the a**
that would be?  Any comments/suggestions?  Actually, the bus I had
before in CA didn't have a cat and it passed.... hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm..

any help/advice/suggestions/comments would be much appreciated!

Thanks,
Mike
