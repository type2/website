Subject: Re: [T2] Hard Starting When Cold

Hi Richard,

The battery is new (about 4 weeks old), and I make sure to drive the Bus 
long enough to charge the battery well.  The spark plugs, wires, cap, and 
rotor are all new (also 4 weeks old).  The fuel, oil, and air filters are 
all new.  The gas tank was drained before the Bus was put up for storage.  
The alternator was replaced 2 years ago.

It's been about 30F here in WNC the past several days, and I've noticed no 
difference in harder starting than when it was warm.  That is, my engine had 
the same problem 2 weeks ago when it was 50F in the morning.  Incidentally, 
even before this rebuild, it took 8 pulses to start.

I installed a CHT gauge, and it reads 325-375F when running on flat ground.  
The highest I've seen is 450F when climbing a hill, but I make sure not to 
overdo it -- I read somewhere that 475 is too hot.  I also have a vacuum 
gauge installed.  It reads around 10&quot; when first starting, but reads 15-18&quot; 
once the engine is warm.

That's the thing that's frustrating me -- the engine makes great power, it 
doesn't stumble or bog, the gauges read correctly (oil press &amp; temp, CHT &amp; 
vac, volts, tach), the heads are brand new, and the bottom end is far from 
used up (only 26k).  I just can't get it to start easily.

Oh well; perhaps I'll pull the engine, rebuild it again, and see if that 
fixes it.  If not, maybe this is a sign that I should get rid of the Bus.

Thanks anyway,
