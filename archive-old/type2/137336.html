Subject: RE: [T2] Pimp My Ride on M-TV

That is why it is called Pimp my ride and not Restore my ride...... I love the
pimping that they do to these rides and if I lived in CA and was between the
ages of 18-22 I would let them pimp my bus. A good way to get a paint job, if
you can stand the wild colors....

They may look crazy, but West Coast Customs in one of the best in the business
for custom cars. Take a look at their website and see the cars they have done.

The guys may be good at what they do, but they cannot act at all.....

Bus Questions:

Does anyone have the height of a 73 westy with pop top? I am building a garage
and looking at a car lift. I was going to put in a low profile lift with no
beam going over the lift so that the bus would not have clearance issues. Then
I found a different lift, with the overhead crossbeam, for a much cheaper
price. I just want to make sure that the bus will not hit the cross beam when
lifted.

Thanks,
Corbett
