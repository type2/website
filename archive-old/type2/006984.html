I found several references in the archives to an article in vwcruizin (on 
online mag?) that was supposed to be an excellent step-by-step guide to 
removing the gas tank in a bus.  My '78 Westfalia's tank is full of rust, 
and I'm hoping I can pull it without dropping the engine.  Does anyone 
know of a newer link to the article or a suitable substitute?  Has anyone 
pulled the tank with the engine in?  My Bentley manual implies that it's 
possible (barely).

Thanks,
