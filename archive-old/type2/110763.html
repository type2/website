Subject: re: jackstands

&quot;What is the proper place to put the jackstands on a
bus? &quot;

  In the back on your next trip to the dump.

I'll never use jack stands again.. but hey.. feel
free!
you can get a decent hydraulic floor jack these days
at a reasonable price.. and 4X4's are even cheaper.
Cut them in 2' lengths and crib them under your bus
anywhere under the frame.. block the wheels.. your
set.
I use the floor jack and then build a 4X4 crib under
the frame and ease the bus back down to the 4X4's.
Never use the hollow concrete blocks.

JMHO
