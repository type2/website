I remember reading from Mark Stephens the California
rebuilder and head supplier, that you really took a
chance rebuilding a Type 4 if you didn't line bore it.
 Otherwise you have a rebuilt engine that has low oil
pressure.

I know one Virginia Type 4 rebuilder who would love to
buy a line bore rig.  Anyone know of any shops ready
to get rid of theirs.
