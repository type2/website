&gt; Hi all,
&gt;  
&gt;       I realize that this is the Type 2 list but I think it's applicaple.  I
&gt;  just test drove a 82 Westy.  The first time I have ever driven a Vanagon.  
I
&gt;  have always had bays.  It seemed to be in very good shape.  Is there
&gt;  anything different to look out for?  The heater blower does not work.  
Where
&gt;  is that located?  Is it a PITA to get to?  It seemed to drive &amp; shift nice.
&gt;  A little more sluggish then my bay windows but I attribute that to the
&gt;  weight.  Any hints or tips would be appreciated.  Thanks.

The heater blower for the early Vanagons is _belt driven_, on the same pulley 
that drives the alternator (directly behind it -- rear is rear).  Yes, it's 
slower than a late baywindow.  
Properly rated tires are even more important than in Buses, as the Vanagon 
body is heavier.  See the Vanagon_dot_com site for details.  
Do not reset the tripmeter while in motion -- Vanagon odometers are a bit 
fragile, and doing this can break one.  The Vanagon mailing list archive has 
repair instructions for this problem.
The large engine bay hatch is nice.
That's all I can come up with at the moment.  Hope it helps.

the T2 list but hit reply too quickly.)
