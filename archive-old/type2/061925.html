Subject: RE: Silver Socket on Dash

I own a 75 campmobile that has this socket but if I remember correctly
there were no wires attached to this, in fact I have been stumped about
its use. If I want to utilize this does any one have any recommendations.

                                                                        Patrick Flynn

                                                                        86 Golf
