&gt;&gt;STAY AWAY FROM GEX!!!! 

GEX is not the only supplier that uses every compromise in the book to bait
those in the need for CHEAP. If they took the money they pay for three color
flashy wizbang ads and put it in the motors, they might just last more that 
a coupla seconds/minutes/hours/months/years. Getting fools to transfer their
money of their own free will and accord for such bait has become the
American way. How to get rich in America: troll for those who will buy into
a facade. With 250,000,000 prospective buyers, you only need to make $1 off
a million bottom feeders to be a millionaire.

Psychic hotlines are more proof of this rampant form of charlatanism
prospering
in our new dark age.
