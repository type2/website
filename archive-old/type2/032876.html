Subject: Westyfalia says Farewell!!!!

The computer gets packed on Tuesday and I already am chin deep in unfinished 
projects that require immediate attention.  I wish all of you the best of 
luck in your travels ahead.  If you need to reach me, feel free to contact me 
direct at Westyfalia_at_aol_dot_com  Once again its been fun and I hope to rejoin 
all of you in spirit in about mid-January once I get my computer unpacked and 
setup again.  Thank you all for a lot of memories, short cuts and ideas. 
Peace Out 
Rick
