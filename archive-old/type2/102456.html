&gt; When I had the 75 rebuilt, I used the exhaust system from a 74 bus, and

well I have a 78 I put the 72-74 exhaust system on, since I have removed
my heat system (use gas heater exclusively) so I have not put the tin
under the pushrod tubes (BUT MUST PUT IN THE above pushrod tube tin) it's
been several years now, nothing appears no be affected.

&gt; &gt; If I were you, I would keep the &quot;skid plate&quot; tin because it redirects flow
&gt; &gt; of the air....think about the air pressure to each side or the engine..... I
&gt; &gt; would bet that the outflow aperature is different slightly to keep the amout
&gt; &gt; of air flowing over the cylinders equal.... this is just a hunch..I can't

couldn't detect anything different.

&gt; &gt; back this up with fact. But, if I was in a hot climate where heating isn't
&gt; &gt; ever needed, I would still keep the shell of the heat exchangers and the
&gt; &gt; associated tin in place.

I'm in a cold climate but my heating system was shot
