Subject: [U] Towing a Bus in Killeen Texas

Classification: UNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY


Volks,



I need to take my 72 Westy to the local VW shop, that will normally not be a
problem, but since I'm currently in Iraq and my wife will not drive it, means
that I need to have it towed. I remember reading somewhere that buses
shouldn't or couldn't be towed the way &quot;regular&quot; cars are. Is that true? Or
it really doesn't matter? Any feedback will be appreciated.  I really want to
be able to drive my bus as soon as I get back, rather than have to wait for
the work to be done, Thanks.



Vic
