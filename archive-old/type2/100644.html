Volks,

OK... so we all know that VW put four fasteners between the engine and
trans for a reason.  Yup, I know that and, yup, I try very hard to get all
....


Well I too in the early bug days had the habit of losing things. so I was
famous for leaving nuts and bolts out. However, on the bus I imagine that a
minimum of two (one on the starter and one on the opposite lower would be
necessary to drive to the nuts and bolts store to pick up the remaining
hardware. On the bus the engine is under greater strain to push our
lumbering giants down the road. So I imagine that things wouldnt be right
for long without all four.

Tyler.
