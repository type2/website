Of course,
&gt; if you already have a good stool but in the wrong color, reupholstering the

&gt; some plaid out from the underside of the upper bunk mattress since that area
&gt; is never visable.

Heck, go all the way!!!

Take both bottoms COMPLETELY out of the two top cushions.  Have sewn in something like corduroy into both bottoms.

Then you will have enough fabric to replace the tacky coverings on your rear seat...  And it will be 'like new'material, without all of the fuzz balls..

If you take the rear seat fabric off, you will have a neat patern that you can take to any seat cover place (with your fabric) to have them stitch up a quick replacement.  A simple job...  BUT be sure your fabric lines up, stripe for stripe between the seat bottom and the seat back (and the rear deck cushion!!) or you will be disappointed. (Nope, didn't happen to me... nope, nope nope..)


BTW, I recently had a whole bunch of fabric washed in my home washing machine. both the cushion coverings and curtains.  Everything came out fine.
 
I also had some top cushion fabric Dry Cleaned before I tried this home laundry thing.  it was money NOT well spent.  better to wash at home, with fabric softener to get out the musty smells!!
