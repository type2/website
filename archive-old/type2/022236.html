Hey folks,
I made it, all be it just a few days late.

I pulled into Running Dog campground the Thursday after the get together.
It went to 39 degrees that night in the dark of the woods.
I was the only one in my camping area.
It was neato!

I WILL be at Running Dog next year.
It is exactly 1,000 miles from my house to Running Dog.
No sweat for a stepper.

Casper, after the heart bypass surgery on the engine, runs just super !!
