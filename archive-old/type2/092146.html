Subject: 81 Vanagon camper sink/stove + engine block

I still have this stuff from years gone by.

All from an 81 Vanagon

sink/stove/fridge combo
water tank, folding bed. rear closet, etc.
2L engine block+crank+cam+rods
BA-6 heater + squirrel cage fan + fuel pump

It's in Iowa. I'm in Colorado. going back in a month
and I am sure my parents would love to see my collection
of VW parts leave with me....

if you are interested in the stuff, drop me a line

thanks for reading
Matt
