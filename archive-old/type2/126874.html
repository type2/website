Subject: Re: [T2] SS magnetic or not magnetic, that is the question

&gt; &gt;And that is conected to a dansk?? (I think) stainless steel muffler.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Get out the magnet. SS is not magnetic as far as I know...

I have one of the SS stock style mufflers that ron had awhile back for
100$
it is magnetic. yes, some stainless is magnetic depending on the alloy,
like has been mentioned.
other than the tailpipe mount clip breaking off requiring a little
creative rigging it is essentially like it looked over a year ago.
best muffler ive had.
fyi
