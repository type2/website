Subject: Re: [T2] Air Fuel Mixture Logic

&gt; When I set the timing by ear and by what provides the best vacuum, I still end
 up with timing that is way advanced from what it should be (7.5 BTDC), 20 for
 one and worse for the second position. The engine dies if I ever try to set it
 near 7.5 BTDC. Vacuum gets around 15-17 InHg when I rev the engine to 1500 rpm.

Jeff, do me a favor and tell me what you get:
Remove the 3/4 valve cover. Rotate the engine in the direction of rotation and watch the #3 valves. At the
exact point of rocking, when the exhaust JUST closes and the intake JUST starts to move, STOP and see where
the timing mark is pointing to. The exact point at the point of rocking. Do not look at the mark or move it to
line it up to zero. I want to know where it is pointing at the exact moment of where the #3 rocker arms will
rock. As you sit there and move the crank back and forth you will actually see them rock.
