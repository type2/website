Well we have moved up into the bay window world.  After 2 splits and two
years on the other list, we just picked up a 68 double cab with disc
brakes and 71 tranny.  We will be looking for bay unique information.

It needs a rear door seal, does someone make it?


   Never found a source since the OEM one became NLA.  WCM makes the
   various seals for single cabs (like the storage door seal under the tray)
   but the rear double cab door does not seem to be catered for by anybody
   that I have found....(anybody with contrary info?)

   Luckily the seal on the rear door of my DC is pretty good so I haven't
   actually had to do this,however if you're desperate,check out the seal from
   the sliding door of a bay window van....maybe one from a junk yard
   to begin with.
   Cut down to the appropriate length,top &amp; bottom,it may well fit the rear
   DC door..The height's gotta be right,just the length needs to be altered.

   Cheers,
