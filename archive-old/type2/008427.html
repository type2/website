John,

Regarding the deck height on the 2.0 Vanagon, I recently put new pistons
and cylinders on what appears to be an previously unmachined case and
stock crank and had a deck height in the 0.035&quot; range. I had planned to
leave the gaskets out at the cylinder bases, but with a deck height of
only 0.025&quot; with this configuration, I thought better to include them and
bump it up to 0.034 to 0.035&quot;.   Wilson mentions 0.040&quot; being the
minimum, but then again there is several comments that do to apply to
Type IV's especially late Type IV's (oil baffles, bolting in oil pick-up
tube, etc).

I searched the Bently and Haynes manuals, but no mention of deck height. 
I called the VW shop that put my crank together (30 years with an
unlisted tel no. - they must be pretty good!) and when I told him I had
0.035&quot;, he said &quot;Your there now you can have a beer!&quot; So based on the
opinion of one, 0.035&quot; seems fine, but
