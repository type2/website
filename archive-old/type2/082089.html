Subject: Re: [T2] pit thoughts

Ric
Several friends of mine had pits in England.
You have top be careful to make sure that CO does not collect in the pit.
The generally are about 5 feet deep, have duck board (boat slats on the 
floor) and can be covered by using 2X4's.
I sort of remember that you have a hillside with the Tennessee fainting 
goats, so you can build it into the hill &amp; not gas yourself.

Have fun &amp; hope to see you all in early October
