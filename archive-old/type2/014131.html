Subject: Re: [T2] Mountain passes in NC



&gt; Volks,
&gt; 2 weeks ago I conquered Old Fort Mountain on I-40 in NC in my 81
&gt; vanagon............looked for a t-shirt stand at the top and definitely felt
&gt; like some sort of gold star should now be worn on my cap!  Took at at 45 MPH
&gt; in 3rd gear...........7 mile 6 % grade.............
&gt; 
&gt; I thought Saluda grade was bad on I-26 ( about a 3 mile 6 % grade) but Old
&gt; Fort puts it to shame!!!

We've got to get you out to the Left Coast where you can climb some real mountains!  How about US 395 between Bishop and Carson 
City in the Sierras?  Start at Bishop, elevation 4100 feet.  In the next 15 miles, climb to Sherwin Summit (7000).  About 30 miles later you 
get to Deadman Summit (8041).  30 more miles gets you to Conway Summit (8138) and another 20 to Devil's Gate Summit (7519).  From 
there you drop into Gardnerville at 4700 feet.  Typically, my stock 1600DP bus (low compression Mexican engine) will maintain 30-35MPH 
on the 6%+ grades on this route.  With the thin air, I doubt that it's making much more than 30HP.  The scenery is so pretty that the slow 
speeds aren't a bother.

Another route for hill-climbers is from Badwater (280 feet _below_ sea level) to Emigrant Pass (5318 feet) in Death Valley.  This route is 
about 50 miles and the temperatures can be a tad warm.

I still think that the worst climb I've done is the western approach to Jerome.  That road is literally carved out of a cliff.
