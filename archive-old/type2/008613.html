Re copyright laws and copying parts manuals:

(-}  I rather doubt that VW is ever going to republish their parts manuals
for pre 80's vehicles or care to waste the time/money if they still own the
 copyright and find out someone is copying the manuals.  Now to make
everyone groan, I wish I had been there when the local dealer threw these
and a lot of speciality tools into the dumpster!  If the worker there who
informed me of this when I went to buy a part had only the forsight to save
them for eBAY, he'd be rich!!!!!
     Now, copying a Bentley or a Haynes; that is another story........MB
