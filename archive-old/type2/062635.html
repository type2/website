DO NOT USE RADIATOR HOSE.  Gas will eat it.  It will probably last for a while 
but in a year or so you may be spewing gas again.  Until then you might get a lot 
of gunk in you gas.  If you get the silicone type of rad hose it will last longer 
since this is more resistant to gas but not completely.

Get a piece of 2.25&quot; inside diameter straight fuel hose reinforced with string 
(not wire).  This will be pliable enough to bend to the required shape.

Hopefully I'm talking about the right hose.  I didn't read the original post but 
I figure you're talking about the 4&quot; hose from filler neck to tank that I was 
inquiring about on the list a few weeks ago.

If Jim _at_ BusBoys is lurking....what's the status on the import efforts for this 
part?  Personally I think you could make much more money if you just had someone 
fabricate the for you.  As long as you sell them for less than $90 you'd be able 
to sell them.
