Subject: Distributor Endplay

Hi All:

Anyone know what the end play specification is for the Bosch
distributor? I have heard that the maximum is somewhere around 0.002 to
0.006. Anyone know where I could find the factory specification? I am
rebuilding a couple of the 022-905-205S (Bosch 0-231-170-093)
vacuum/mechanical advance distributors and would like to know what to
set it at.

I think that it must be more than 0.002 as the dog gear has at least
0.002 play around the retaining roll pin.

TIA

Regards,
