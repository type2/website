Hi Dave et al,

Despite the fact that VW had a good idea with the OEM fan switch, I found 
their execution to be pretty cheap and cheesy.  I installed 2 blowers (one 
above the engine and one under the cab floor), and have hooked them up to a 
VW headlight switch.  The rear blower is on the running light circuit, and 
the front one is on the headlight circuit.  One switch for both fans, with 
individual control of each.  Plus, the rear stays on when the front comes 
on.  I've been using this every day for almost 2 months now, and have had no 
problems.

Good luck with your individual solution, and keep us posted.

Regards,
Jason Upper
