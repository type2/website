Subject: Re: [T2] gas tank swap?

Tanks are identical 68-71 on trucks &amp; vans, according to my 73 dated factory
parts book.

&gt; Guys,
&gt; I'm finally getting round to doing some work on my 68 dbl cab and have
&gt; pulled the gas tank out of it.
&gt; Ugghh...the outside bottom of the tank is waaay more rusty than I would
&gt; like and I am worried about it pinholing when I get it boiled out.
&gt; Anyone know swap limits between busses and trucks?
&gt; I hoped that a tank from a bus between 68 and 71 would be the same?
&gt; Chris as Busted Bus has one out of a 71, but fitment is unknown for sure.
&gt; Cheers, dave
