Subject: Re: [T2] the hubcap

Hi Jim,

I agree that it needs to go west. The problem is that no-one can  
effectively manage the &quot;herd-of-cats&quot; that surround the hubcap. There  
is far too much chaos involved, and no way to make everyone happy.  
Everyone who tries to do it winds up offending *someone*, and hurting  
feelings.

If you want to step up as 2007 Hubcap Tour Co-ordinator, the job is  
available.

I managed to find it and get it moving again.  My work here is done.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

&gt;&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; OK, we've now determined that the hubcap is stranded in  
&gt;&gt; Albuequeque NM, and I should soon have the email of its current  
&gt;&gt; custodian.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Somehow I seemed to have stepped into the role of cat-herder  
&gt;&gt; again. You think I'd know better by now.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Are there any listmembers who travel near ABQ??   Who wants it  
&gt;&gt; next??  Right now the preference is to get it into the hands of  
&gt;&gt; the west-coast listees.  I'm thinking Ratwell, George Lyle, John  
&gt;&gt; Kolak, Don Tujela &amp; Troy should be high on the list, and so should  
&gt;&gt; Mark Hineline, even if he's just riding along inside a bus with it  
&gt;&gt; for a while. But there's plenty of hubcap to go around... p-mail  
&gt;&gt; me if you're interested and we'll see if we can get this thing  
&gt;&gt; moving again.
