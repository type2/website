Subject: Brake lights &amp; Speedo:69 Westy

Once again....:)

First, the speedo: anyone have anyidea how to fix it?  it varies 
widely...at 90 i'm doing 65, with the speedo pegged, 69, yet at 45, only 
40. 
And various speeds inbetwixt. All &quot;real&quot; speeds locked ona 74 super that 
was following me..

As for the brakelights, anyone have a simple method to check the itches, 
so i can narrow the problem down? preferably w/o having to use a 
multitester..:)nodavaliable! It's not the bulbs, or the fuse..:)
