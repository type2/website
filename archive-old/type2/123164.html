Subject: Re: [T2] 77 Automatic - Selector Cable needed !

&gt; I'm searching for a selector cable for my 77 automatic

&gt; The bentley manual has a decent diagram though not
&gt; exact for my model year, on page 43 of Automatic
&gt; Transmission, it'd be part 12 in the diagram.
&gt; 
&gt; The cable peice that attaches the wire cable to the
&gt; selector cable is pulled right out. 

I know I got one for my 78 couple years ago, but derned if I can remember
where, but I suspect it is from this VW repair shop in southwest central
PA.  I have his card here somewhere, but he claims to have several
containers full of every cable VW ever made....he has had every cable I
needed, 

  if you can't find one I will tear my office apart for his card it's here
somewhere

&gt; not sure of the validity of putting another old part
&gt; on there, but if it's in decent shape I might try.

yeah that is a cable that used is not real easy to put on

good luck
Bob
