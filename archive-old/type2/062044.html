Tom, JDR sells a kit called &quot;The Zapper&quot; and they say that it will 
activate any radar detector within 3/4 mile. The kit costs $39.95. 
They don't seem to worry about transmitting on this frequency, 
although they do also call the kit a &quot;10Ghz Amateur Transmitter.&quot; So 
maybe if you call it an &quot;amateur&quot; transmitter and it is under a 
certain power level there is no license required?
