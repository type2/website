&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; FYI
&gt; I found out that a 1700 transmission can be altered
&gt; to fit up with a 1600 engine.
&gt; If I get it done I will let you know what this involves.

It doesn't involve anything.  The 1600, 1500, or 1200 will bolt right in,
as long as it uses a 12v 200mm flywheel.  You'll have to use a late clutch
pressure plate (w/o ring on the diaghram springs), and the appropriate
throwout bearing...but the engine and transmission will bolt together
fine.

Mid/late '75 on transmissions have a deeper bellhousing or shorter input
shaft, and require modifications for such.  But 72-mid75 bolts up fine.

Now, if you want to put the late transaxle in a 68-71 bus (or the 1600
enigne in the 72+ bus), that's a whole different story.  Usually a
nosecone and bellhousing swap will get the late tranny into the early bus,
but the early engine in the late bus means it's time to search the
archives. :)
