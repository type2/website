Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Pedal =&gt; Excessive Travel

Barry,
A few suggestions
- Maybe you adjusted the brakes in the rear the wrong way. If the
handbrake does not grab earlier than before, there is something wrong
with the adjustment you did. To know which way to turn the star I
imagine that I am the screw in the star adjuster. Then it is easy to
know how to turn the star to make the screw move out of the star (and
bring the brake shoe close to the drum)
- Double check that the system was bled properly. Maybe after driving
around a bit, a big bubble will show up somewhere.
- Mark the level on the brake fluid reservoir, turn the engine on (to
have power brakes) and pump the brakes hard several times. Does the
pedal go to the floor eventually ? Does the fluid level go down ? That
would say fluid leak or faulty master cylinder.

Talking about brakes, today (Sunday) Kragen turned my two drums for 9$
a piece, between 10.30am and 11.30am. It's not nice for the guys there
who have to work sundays, but I darn like that store open Sundays.

- Arnaud
