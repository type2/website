Subject: Re: [T2] towing weights?

Hi Dave,

In the old days (When I was young and stoopid) I had a 72 westy with a 
914 engine. I had no problem using a tow-bar to pull a baja beetle 200 
miles to a friends cottage. It took a lot of patience to get up to 
highway speed and a lot of planning to get it stopped again safely.

I'm nicer to my buses now than I used to be.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Love this list...got to thinking about my tow hitch that I haven't
&gt; installed on my bus yet and wondering what the weight capacities
&gt; were....went an looked it up on our site and &quot;wow&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; Trailer weight for my 78 is 2645lbs with trailer brakes!
&gt; without brakes is 1322 lbs.
&gt;
&gt; but tongue weight of only about 110lbs....hmmmm
&gt;
&gt; Anyone ever pushed this limit and lived to tell?&lt;grin&gt;
