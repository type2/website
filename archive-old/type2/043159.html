Subject: alternator install

hi all,

In teh past i have recommended getting an original volkswagen alt stand as
they fit better, but i must revise that.

I bought an alternator for my 61 and put it in last night, and trying to
use an original old school VW alt stand there were some ribs on the bottom
of the new alt that hit the stand, made the thing sit all cockeyed.

Luckily i also had 2 aftermarket stands, one of recent manufacture, and
one old one.  The old one was the same as the VW one, the new ones are
designed entirely differently to clear the ribs on the alt, i/e the round
part of the tower goes up less far before narrowing down to clear the alt.

So... i would say that if you buy an alt make sure you have a stand that
fits it.

I am saving my old school stand to go with a motorola alternator i have,
but even then if that alt dies, and i have to buy a new one it'd be nice
to already have a stand that will fit it on my engine.

But anyway, the install went fine otherwise and i now have a charging
system again :)

take care,

Steve

(my generator died east of indianapolis and i had to drive all the way to
saint louis on battery juice alone.  Luckily it was daytime or i never
would have made it! 6+ hours straight through with one stop for gas.)
