Subject: Re: [T2] high octane gas

I do not believe the increase in mpg for 91 octane vs. 87 octane is 
'minute' - I know I get at least 3 mpg more with 91 octane - my bus also 
just runs better, it sounds better and it goes faster.

I cannot believe anyone can't notice the difference in performance with high 
vs. low octane gas - on both of my buses it is obvious to me ... and I have 
complete records that show the better mpg with 91 octane.


&gt;
&gt; I am a firm believer that regular gas is a better buy than premium, even 
&gt; with a minute MPG increase factored in (if it even exists).  If your 7.6 
&gt; engine is pinging on regular, there is something wrong with it.  Too much 
&gt; timing, damage to the piston or combustion chamber, overheating, bad gas, 
&gt; etc..
