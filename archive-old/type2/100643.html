Subject: Interior fun

Listerines:

Well, having two busses is cool. Recently I've finished removing just about everything left rear of the &quot;B&quot; pillar that makes my bus a camper, and temorarily installing seats &amp; gear from my deluxe sunroof till it gets back on the road.

Made some new panels out of 1/8&quot; thick &quot;Luan&quot; as it's called at the Orange place (H Depot), and used old panels as templates.

Came out pretty good with the jigsaw. Also installed some R13 insulation underneath them and foamed some areas in for noise reduction. One note! If you want the 3X expanding foam that dries hard, watch out for the Dap label stuff, it dries soft and spongey and doesn't expand at all.

Got some curtains out of a '77 that went to the yard and put them in too.

Keep in mind, before flaming, my bus originally had blue plaid interior, long gone, had green/yellow installed which passed it's time, is a 76 with a 79 motor and many other atrocities long ago committed before my ownership. So everything's an improvement from here.

Enjoying my bus,

Billy
