Subject: Re: [T2] Need 17mm hex plug socket

You know, for a quick fix, you can also find metric bolts that have a
17mm head that fits right in.  Lock a couple of nuts onto it and use it
in your 17mm socket (kinda) like before ;)

Later,

&gt;&gt;Howdy. All my tools got stolen a while back, and I keep finding new things
&gt;&gt;that I'm missing. I'm looking for the 17mm hex plug socket, for the tranny
&gt;&gt;plugs, that fits onto a 3/8&quot; ratchet. I've checked around at all the
&gt;&gt;FLAPS, even the VW place, and no one has them any more. I guess I can
&gt;&gt;always just get the big hex wrench, but the one for the ratchet was always
&gt;&gt;a lot easier to use. Any leads or sources? Thanks,
