X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

hey all,
 I am sharing this with all lists due to it being a general VW type thing.
Last month my neighbor gave me a set of driving lights, the small ones that
look like eyeballs. I put all the wiring in, but I did not like the look of
those goofy lights. I had recently parted out a 68 type 3 and on the rear
bumper they have a set of small back-up lights.(they use the same lenses as
the pre 72 Bus back up lights) These can also be used as turn signals or
what ever. Well I got to looking at them and found that if I pulled the
bulbs out I could put in the small Halogen lights from the light kit. I then
drilled holes in the bottom of my bumper and they look great. They are very
bright, but they do not cast the light out very far due to the lens. This is
perfect for me, I am going to put in some H4 halogen headlights and they
tend to cast the light way far out, but not close to the car. These little
lights will fill in the void. To get the wiring to look stock I used genuine
VW wires, and the lights have a grove around them to hold a little boot. I
used the boots off of Bus heater cables. They are small acordian type boots.
These keep water out and look stock too. All in all I am real pleased, and
due to my pack rat habits it cost me nothing. I will have a picture up on my
web page soon. Anyway, get creative and have fun, you can do a lot with
stricktly VW stuff.
