you need to rent or purchase an empty tank, and then take it to any
compressed gas place (Robert's is a big one)and they swap it for a
full tank. I use an 80cuft tank (mid size, maybe 3ft high) and it was
about $40 for an Argon/CO2 &quot;welding mix&quot;, which seems to work best.

$79 depending on the size may or may not be a good buy. I don't think you
want much less than an 80cuft tank (I have 2) unless you don't hardly do
any welding at all.

you also still need a regulator for the gas tank. need one specifically
for Mig welding gas or an adjustable one.

&gt; Since it seems that the gas portion of welding with my MIG is no more a
&gt; difficult setup than it currently is without gas, I figured I would like to
&gt; try it - especially if it gives me deeper welds - in theory.
&gt;
&gt; Lastly, what type of wire would I need to change to since it seems that
&gt; flux-core is supposed to provide the same benefit of welding with gas?

I use solid .030 wire.

and get a good mask. the electronic ones are fantastic, pricy, but you
only get one set of eyeballs.
