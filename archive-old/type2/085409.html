Subject: Re: [T2] &quot;Stupid Mistake&quot; is running!

Hi Biill,

Power to the coil should be supplied from a wire controlled by the ignition
switch. If the coil is somehow supplied power from the alternator or battery
(or both) then the engine cannot be turned off by the key.

I had the opposite problem after my last engine drop, I had no power at the
coil and it would turn over but would not run. I had to hotwire my bus for a
couple of days until I had time to sort it out. Bad Idea...when I wanted to
shut it down I had to open the hatch and pull the alligator clip off the
battery. Which sounds pretty similar to what's happening in your case.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Yep, sounds great.
&gt; 
&gt; We put our rebuilt Type 1 engine into our bus, hooked up the electrical and
&gt; it started!!
&gt; 
&gt; Sounded great.
&gt; 
&gt; I put on a head temperature device on cylinder #3 and it never got over
&gt; 275oF (VDO gage).
&gt; 
&gt; Is that temp OK?
&gt; 
&gt; Is an oil temp or pressure gage advised?
&gt; 
&gt; But, I could not turn the engine off!
&gt; 
&gt; Turned the key off an nada, kept running.
&gt; 
&gt; Disconnected the battery and nada, kept running.
&gt; 
&gt; Thought it might have a demon!
&gt; 
&gt; Then remembered that I put in an alternator with internal regulator.
&gt; 
&gt; I think I hooked up the wiring from the key to the alternator wrong.
&gt; 
&gt; I have been ploughing through the wiring diagrams.
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone point me into the right direction on this?
&gt; 
&gt; Many thanks.
&gt;
