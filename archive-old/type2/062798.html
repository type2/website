&gt; Hello,
&gt;       I would like to submit a question to the all knowing and all-powerful
&gt; list. I have a 1965 21 Window Deluxe Microbus (non-walkthru) which needs
&gt; both a middle and rear seat. I would like to know if a non-walkthru
&gt; deluxe ever originally came with the smaller 2/3 seat (that I've seen in
&gt; walk-thrus) or ONLY with the full seat with the pivoting back-rest near
&gt; the doors. All the old ads I've seen show the nine seat arrangement.
&gt;       I just bought the 2/3 middle seat from Dan Kinsey (That VWguy). In the
&gt; meantime I am happy to have a seat which fits there.  But if this is not
&gt; &quot;correct&quot; I would like to eventually trade the smaller seat for the full
&gt; length one. Thanks,

An easy way to tell which seat your Deluxe (or Kombi) had is by the holes
in the mat if it still has it, or by the seat mounting holes welded in the
belly floor.  I'm not sure if the full or 2/3 middle seat was necessarily
dictated by the walk thru/non-walkthru models.  Hope this helps a little.
