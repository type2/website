Subject: RE: [T2] Popping out of 4th gear at times?

&gt; Bus depot has some on their site for $579.95 plus core. Pricey to ship
&gt; transmissions though - but you could get a replacement pretty quickly compared
&gt; to having someone build it.
&gt;
&gt; -Daniel
&gt;
&gt; &gt; So what is one typically looking at to have a tranny&gt; rebuilt? I know mine
&gt; needs to be done, but I thought I&gt; was looking at about $1000-$1200.

that is Auto tranny rebuild prices, manual is much less.
