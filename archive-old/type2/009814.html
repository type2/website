&gt; Jason,
&gt; About 18 years ago I had an extremely bad experience with a Midas
shop is 
&gt; Santa Rosa Ca. and Bellevue Wa. The SR shop charged me for a brake
job they 
&gt; didn't perform. I had trouble in Washington they took my warranty
and handed 
&gt; me brake pads. When I removed the hubs I found the original German
pads!  A 
&gt; couple of nasty letters later they agreed to inspect my work. I
think they 
&gt; topped the fluid Reservoir.
&gt; Since then I do most of the work myself. My 2 cents.

They haven't changed.  My Father had his brakes worked on in his
M*rcury, and they misinstalled the pads with the anti-chatter springs
pushing inward on the pads.  400 miles later the pads and rotors were
trash.  This was far from a Midas outlet, so I replaced the pads and
rotors myself.  We took polaroids of the botched installation and kept
the old parts.  

Took everything back to the shop that did the work.  They looked at
everything and said &quot;We'd never screw it up like that.&quot; and refused to
do anything about it.  We persisted and asked to talk to the mechanic
listed on the  receipt.  &quot;Oh, he doesn't work here any more.&quot; they
said.  We asked how they could vouch for the work of a mechanic that
didn't even work there any more.  &quot;Well, I inspect every job&quot; says the
manager-guy.  While we were talking, we could clearly see a brake job
being finished and buttoned up in the bay directly outside his office,
and pointed out that he hadn't &quot;inspected&quot; that one.  

Well, we had pushed him about as far as we could go without any
positive effect, so we left and contacted the franchise company.  They
were considerably more helpful and sent an adjuster out who looked at
our parts and photos and issued a check for the cost of fixing the
damage.  This didn't come close to the cost of hassling with the
dealer and working our way up the ladder to find a responsible party.

After that, I do my own brakes and my father (who is 87 and doesn't
work on cars anymore) uses his local independent mechanic.

Be very suspicious of any auto-repair outfit who advertises widely. 
This means that they depend upon bringing in new suckers via the
advertising, not satisfied repeat customers.
