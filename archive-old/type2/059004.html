     My 72 camper with a 1977 2 liter engine has on occasion leaked oil with
much profusion.  The oil had a strong gasoline odor.  This occurred while the
bus sat idly for a week or so.  Only once when being driven did it occur and
that was when I rolled it backwards and jump started it in reverse.  Each time
this occurs I have drained out the remaining oil and changed the filter.
Someone suggested that it might be a float needle valve sticking and whacking
the side of the carb might be a temporary solution.  The same problem occurred
with an older 1850cc engine that finally had to be replaced.  I do have an
electric fuel pump on it but try to avoid having the key on when the engine is
not running.  Any ideas or suggestions would be appreciated.
