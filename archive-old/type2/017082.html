   David said the other day that the 091 trannys all were 4.57 --
looking in Bentley, they show the 5.375 up thru '73, then 4.86 from then
on (this Bentley covers up to '79). I know the 091b or whatever it's
called in the '80-83 Vanagons have the 4.57, so what year did the 4.57
show up? I thought the 091 came out in '74, although it was weird for
that year, and changed again in '75???
    Obviously Bentley is screwed up in these specs -- gasp! If we can't
believe Bentley, what can we believe? I see some other weirdness there
where they show pictures of two bellhousings and clutch fork types --
calling one the early model tranny and the other the late model, but
both have no lugs for the rear tranny mounts.
