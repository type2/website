&gt; 4. Reconnect and adjust crossbar linkage (IMPORTANT!)

&gt; 7. Disconnect crossbar linkage from both carbs
&gt; 8. Use Unisyn to verify balance (it was darn close without doing
&gt; anything), use volume screws to nail.
&gt; 9. Pull solenoid wires on each to verify they both drop the same. Note
&gt; that you will need to turn the idle up to 1200 rpms to keep from
&gt; stalling while doing this.
&gt; 10. Reconnect crossbar linkage to both carbs, verifying the throttle
&gt; positions do not change (readjust as necessary).

It would seem you could keep the cross bar disconnected the entire time
during these steps.
