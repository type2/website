To tell Adventure, look at Nikki's site or note the windows on the
top fold out pagoda? style.  Safare and Contempo used sliders?
The interiors are all drastically different, and I think Safare had
at least 2 models even within their product line I've seen, Dave?
Personally I've seen more Safares than Adventures around me.

Their is also some real bizzare even higher top thing out there,
I got no clue what it is.
