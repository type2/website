Subject: Re: Ruminations on heating a VW bus while camping (small correction)

I know, corrections are boring and take up something called &quot;bandwidth.&quot; 
Better to proofread. But the last sentence in 2b should read: &quot;But I think
that they are perfectly safe to use for a period of five minutes or so, as
a radiant heater.&quot; Not a space heater. A radiant heater.
