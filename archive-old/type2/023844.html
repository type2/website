Subject: Re: [T2] bay area VW mechanic? loose front end

Chris-
         The looseness and rust in the front end might be a prelude to a 
complete col-
lapse...I'd get the ice pick out and start poking the beam and, in 
particular, the horns
for the shocks. Sounds like there might be more rust than is readily 
apparent. I'm
sure there's quite a few list members whose front beams &quot;looked&quot; OK, but 
eventually
failed...
