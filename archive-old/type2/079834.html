Subject: Re: [T2] Who to rebuild heads?

&gt;I'm gonna want to have a set of 1800cc heads rebuilt. I've heard it's 
&gt;best to have someone familiar with T4 engines do the heads. I don't 
&gt;know.
&gt;
&gt;Can anyone reccommend a place to do this job?

It's a long ways from you, but NW Connecting Rod in Seattle are VW
spezialist maschinists that can be trusted to do VW machine work right
every time. If you can't locate a reputable VW machinist in your area,
consider them to provide quality work, despite the distance. The process
for R&amp;R of valve guides and seats requires very high skills on these T-IV
heads. Standard procedure will just make junk out of them. The factory says
there is no process and advize replacement of the heads with new if the old
ones are out of tolerance or cracked. That's because they know few
machinsts have the enhanced knowledge/skills/equipment to do fix them right
so they won't fail prematurely.

NW ConRod services all VW, from T-I to VR-6, gas or diesel. Tell Jerry (son
of father that started the business and still hangs around the shop just
for the smell of it) I sent you.

Regards,

PS: I don't have the number here at home, but web yellow pages will find it
for you.
