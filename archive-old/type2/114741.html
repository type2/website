&gt;&gt; Yes, I change it myself.  It would be hard to justify 6000 mile 
&gt;&gt; intervals if you're being ripped off at $30 a pop.
&gt;&gt;
&quot;Boy, talk about cheap. That's $15 for the lube, $5 for equipment 
financing, $5 for rent and utilities, and $5 for the mechanic and owner 
to share. What assholes they are to not go bankrupt so you won't call 
them rip offs. If you had a reasonable equipped shop to service T-II's 
properly, how much would you charge??? How much extra if the baby needs 
new shoes, too, over and above the business overhead???&quot;

In the first place, they are not paying $15 for 5+ pints of gear oil.  
If they are, they deserve to go out of business for stupidity.

Second, the needs of their baby have nothing to do with the value of 
the product or service they are offering.

Third, it is common practice to put up a big banner offering $12.95 oil 
changes, including 5 quarts of oil and a filter.  The same place will 
then charge $29.95 for a transmission oil change.  Excuse me for seeing 
2.5 quarts of gear oil, no filter, and less labor, at more than twice 
the price, as a rip-off.

Finally, I just threw $30 out there as an example.  Maybe they are 
charging $40, $50, or even $100 where you live.  Does it change the 
point I was making?

Go ahead, flame away.
