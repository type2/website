well finally had a decent day and put the timing gun on it????  timing is
way off no I mean WAY off like 120 degrees off.??  WTF??  did a lot of
stupid things that made it run worse until I realized somewhere along the
line I put the fan on the crank 120 degrees off or one bolt hold off.  but
how did I get the fan on with the woodruff key.   Then it dawns on me, I
haven't had the timing gun on it since the fan fell off last winter,  well
it was about 15 degrees and I was on the side of I-70 in Western Maryland
and just put the thing back on......must have spun off the key and not
realized it when I put the fan back on..

so figure out where TDC is (using old tried and true pencil system) put a
new mark on the fan and retimed it..... well not perfect but way better
than it was.....

sometimes it is the &quot;Strangest&quot; things that drive you wackoo...


Thanks for the ideas

Bob
