Progress! I took my bus to a guy over in Dallas named Jimmy McGee of McGee's
Auto Service. When I started it up he said, &quot;Sounds like you've got a vacuum
leak.&quot; He brought out a can of ether with a tube on it, and started spraying
it on the intake manifold, when he got to the drivers side rubber boot, the
engine increased RPM. &quot;There's your leak.&quot; When I tightened down the clamp,
it changed my idle speed, so I set my idle again to 900 RPM, and advanced my
timing to 28 degrees full advance. That gives me about 14 degrees BTDC at
idle. I'm letting her cool down, then I'm putting the Berg dipstick sensor
back in, and heading up the highway to see what happens. I hope it makes a
difference.
Another thing, my carb says H30/31 PICT on the side of it, but it fits on
the dual port intake without having to have an offset. Is my carb really a
34 PICT?
Thanks to everyone who has responded.
