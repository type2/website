The show is at the Orange County Fair Grounds on Sunday.  gates open at
9:00.  tickets are either $10 or 11 each.  expect there to be alot of bugs
and other vw's.  mostly young croud there.  parts can be good and bad.
depends on what you are looking for.  

i will be there with my 60 crew cab.  if anybody from the list goes, stop
by.  it is a grey/tan 1960 crew cab that is 95% stock and %100 beutiful
and for sale.

see you all there.

Take care and God Bless
