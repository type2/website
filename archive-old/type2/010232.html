&gt; &gt;Just wondering if anyone had a source or would like to sell the tin
&gt; needed
&gt; &gt;to convert to an upright engine in a pancake engine bus.
&gt; 
&gt; This is notoriously hard to get in the US but Just Kampers in the UK
&gt; sells
&gt; it and they've gotten high marks from people who've bought from them.
&gt; Evidently they take credit cards and it's just like dealing with a US
&gt; mail
&gt; order company except the shipping takes a little longer.

I think that Bus Depot also got some of this tin the last time they
went over to the Oulde Countree.  http://www.busdepot_dot_com
