Re: fundamental problem with cooling (or not)

The only thing I can come up with is the cam since:
- this is a fresh clean rebuild, stock except the cam
- all cooling airways are clear
- cooling flaps and thermostat working as designed
- new engine to body seal, fitting nicely
- no known (and I looked) vac leaks, and this is not an issue to the 
same degree since with Megasquirt the fuel is metered primarily off 
manifold pressure which is downstream of most common vac leaks
- and Mike, the autotune regime does not tune into the wide-open 
throttle, low vacuum part of the fuel map. This is tuned by hand in the 
table and as recommended is left as a bit rich.  I do understand the 
utility of the WB sensor; perhaps it is more critical to have that 
control in an AC engine, although obviously VW never did.

Hence, given the above, why I am mystified, and why I am reverting to 
the stock cam.
