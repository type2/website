Subject: Re: [T2] Bay windshield installation Siliacone spray

&gt;&gt;Silicone will screw up paint terribly
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I think we may be confusing silicone spray with silicone sealant RTV.
&gt;Silicone RTV sealant will damage the paint and promote rust right under 
&gt;the paint.
&gt;Silicone spray is a dry lubricant that goes on wet and when the suspension 
&gt;solution evaporates the silicone is left in a dry film which is very 
&gt;different from silicone RTV.
&gt;I have never seen damage to any surface as a result of silicone lube spray.

I didn't mean it would hurt existing paint, but would ruin any new paint 
put over it if not removed. BUT - does the danger exist forever or is it 
like an oil which can be removed easily by a proper prep?
