Subject: rooftop campers...

I'd like to find out just how common (or rare) some campers available for
use on VWs are.

Please send me some email if you've ever actually seen or know of the
existence of a Dove camper or a Carbak camper.  You can see what they look
like at http://www.village_dot_org/vw/tents/nonwesty.html

The Dove camper that I'm most interested in is the one in the top-left
thumbnail image.

TIA
