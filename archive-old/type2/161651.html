Subject: steering wheel/column transplant - doable?

My 74 westie is causing me some grief this week.
The ignition switch is faulty and I went to change it over.
Grub screws which are inset into the column to release the
ignition are messed up and stripped - thus making it umm
difficult...

So today I went out of town, checked my 78 and decided
what the heck. In 20 minutes I removed the whole steering
wheel / column assembly. Another 10 minutes and I took
the whole wiring harness too. Didn't have to cut anything.
Brought the fuse box and all.

Anyone done this? I know it should bolt in no problem.
Guess im wondering about the wiring.

We also took all the needed windows out of the old bus
and sealed the bus up. 3 windows and a windshield ready for
transplant. The old bus is slowly replacing the current one.
It's kinda eerie.

Anyway. What do you all think?
