Subject: re Great Bus Tour--

Get it to Phoenix--and i will get it to the West Coast--then i can ship it to
Germany and have the German Bus Club Bulli Kartei move it around!! as of this
moment Bulli Kartei is moving supplies of food and clothing and first aide
equipment to Sarajevo in their VW BUSES!!!
they have been doing this thru all the fighting for years!! Possibly we could
get some help from the Vintage Bus listees??  TWWM, uj
