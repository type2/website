Subject: Re: [T2] Cleaning engine parts

--- Carlos Del Rio &lt;cdelrio_at_concentric_dot_net&gt; wondered:
&gt; What's recommended for cleaning the engine: parts,
&gt; tins, et al.?
&gt; I read kerosene, gasoline, &quot;solvent&quot; (too generic a
&gt; term).  And how does one
&gt; go about eliminating the waste?
&gt; TIA

A racer friend of mine told me a long time ago, &quot;Gas
is for cleanin', alcohol is for drinkin', nitromethane
is for racin'.&quot;  

I use kerosene...not as combustible, almost as
effective.  Waste?  Take it to the local oil recycling
yard.

Paul
