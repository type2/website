Subject: wish me luck

Hello all,

well, its been a while since ive been around, after my fiasco with trying to 
put a used motor into my 76 before I moved to MN didnt work out, I ended up 
selling it to the first guy with $450 in hand. Note that was after dropping 
$1400 into the thing to try and get it back here.

that said, I may be back in bus.siness after all. found a supposedly 
&quot;immaculate&quot; 75 westy with 65,000 original miles through a friend of the 
family and will be going to take a look at it either this or next weekend.

ive only had two busses thus far, but I miss driving it every single day. I 
used to drive back and forth to work 5 times a week 40 miles round trip and 
after 3 years of constant bus driving, its really strange to be behind the 
wheel of anything else. at least now I know how the rest of you non-CA/AZ 
drivers feel in the winter.

so anyway, I just wanted to drop a note to say hello to the community, in 
the hopes that I won't feel depressed staying active on this list in the 
future, thinking about times of past, rather looking forward to times of 
future.

hope all your roads are long and your watch inoperable.

best,
Christopher
