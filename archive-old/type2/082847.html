Subject: Aftermarket Tents

I have a 79 Westy pop top and I'm looking for an
aftermarket side tent to attach to the outside.
 Will anyone out there with an aftermarket side tent
such as the ones that EuroCampers sells let me know
which one you have and all the pro's and con's with
that particular model.
Any info would be greatly appreciated.

My wife and I will be taking a 8 week road trip to the
east coast from Reno to Florida and up to vermont in
early July. Gotta have a tent so we can spread out and
get the kid 'outside'
