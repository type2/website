reply to jamie auch-

i was thinking you were looking for 46 mm brakes, i just got it...
why don't you look at that  $8 tool in the RMMW catalog ? you can
abuse it like a Sears ratchet and , although you can't break it, it's
good for a lifetime warranty...

&gt;Need to replace my rear shoes on my '70 westy.  I can't find a 46 mm
&gt;anywhere.  Is there a standard size that will work?  Thanks
