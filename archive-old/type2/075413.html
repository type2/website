Great idea, Jim, and if you can download them and/or print them out, blow
them up if necessary to make them legible, the tiny wire and terminal
descriptors and such, then you have the info.

I have gotten many diagrams off the internet and seen the products emailed
and faxed by professional suppliers such as Sm-AllData and Motor's and the
great majority were illegible in black and white or color. The vintage bus
colored items are wonderful. If you have a color printer, that would be
nice, but printed on my b/w laser machine the descriptors are mostly
illegible. Nothing can beat the real deal diagrams in hand, whether color
or b/w, because they are legible, even with a hand glass if needed by eyes
are older.
