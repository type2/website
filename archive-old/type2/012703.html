Subject: Synthetics dissapearing??

This thread has made a couple of comments with regard to synthetic
motor oil brands becoming hard to find and that got me thinking 
of a comment made to me at my local FLAPS.  I was getting some
Mobil 1 (for the wifes car) and I grabbed the last 6 qts of 
15-50.  I made the comment that the Mobil 1 stock looked pretty
low,  there was only 3 qts left and only in a winter weight.
The manager told me that he was looking at discontinuing the brand
because 'nobody buys the stuff'.  At the time I thought it  was 
just Mobil 1 but now you've got me thinking....any thoughts?

I know it's not Friday.  Sorry for the off post.

Derek
