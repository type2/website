Subject: Re: [T2] New Engine for a 78 Westy

I've been very happy with my new Raby (www.aircooledtechnology_dot_com) engine. 
It's got plenty of extra umph when needed, the turn-around time was as 
expected, and he's already got everything set up to ship an engine to 
anywhere it's needed.

All in all, the money spent was well worth it. In the few weeks I've driven 
it, I've already put over 1500 miles on it (and I only live 10 miles from my 
office!) and am preparing for a trip to the moutains this weekend. While I'm 
concerned about the rest of the 30 year old parts, the engine is the least 
of my concearns.

In fact, the only problem I'm having is a good one. The silly thing runs too 
cool to generate any heat, while there's plenty of air blowing through the 
vents, it's cold. I've said it before, but I can get out after 2 hours of 
solid driving and place my hand on any part of the engine without any fear 
of getting burned. I guess I'll appreciate that more this summer...

&gt;
&gt;I haven't done much with lists before, so I hope this is the right way to 
&gt;post a new topic.
&gt;
&gt;I have a 78 Westy that I bought in the fall of 1977.  I picked it up at 
&gt;Bielefeld (I think that was it) and drove it in Europe for the next 3 
&gt;years. I now have 160k on it, and don't really need it any more, but for 
&gt;sentimental reasons, I can't bring myself to part with it, so I've decided 
&gt;to restore it for use as a spare bedroom/toad with my motorhome. The engine 
&gt;runs, but it is tired and needs a bit of a tuneup. I've located a couple 
&gt;vendors on the net who will supply rebuilt engines a surprisingly 
&gt;reasonable prices in the neighborhood of eleven or twelve hundred bucks. I 
&gt;don't know what the cost will be after shipping.
&gt;
&gt;My question is: what is the quality of these engines, or would it be worth 
&gt;my while to do the rebuild myself for some reason such as to insure the 
&gt;quality of the work? I haven't worked on VW engines much before (haven't 
&gt;needed to), but I am a fairly competent mechanic. I'm retired and spend 
&gt;most of my time rebuilding muscle cars in a vain attempt to remember the 
&gt;joys of my youth. I have a very complete shop that I built myself last 
&gt;summer (www.ohran_dot_com/eastshop), so rebuilding the engine myself would 
&gt;probably not be inconvenient. However, it the quality of the rebuilt 
&gt;engines available is adequate, then I'd probably rather spend my time on 
&gt;other projects. (BTW, has anyone ever seen a Pontiac 455 in one of these 
&gt;buses?  Ok, that a joke... don't anyone take me seriously).
&gt;
&gt;So, to summarize... I am looking for reports from satisfied customers who 
&gt;have bought a rebuilt engine from some company. I would also appreciate any 
&gt;reports from unsatisfied customers, as well.
