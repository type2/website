&gt; Loud music, played through speakers in the front also does wonders.


Heh, heh, we used to own THE VANAGON FROM HELL (aka as &quot;the Money
Pit&quot;--a 1980; boy were we suckered...) and hubby type person installed
two 40 watt speakers in the back.  We used to crank that puppy when they
started fighting.  Worked too!  Especially with some Led Zeppelin (sp?);
Casmir was great.  Of course any of those Robert Palmer songs worked
too.  Classical also worked, if we could find some heavy duty stuff.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;So how many kids under 12 can you strap to a roof rack?
&gt; 
&gt; Three to a layer.

Hmmm, would've thought at least 4-5, but maybe that is only with the
little ones.
