 What he really really wants is a Weekender. He really likes the interior of a Westfalia, but doesn't want the
massive fiberglass top.

 I told him that some Busses came with Rag tops in the center, and that most Westfalias were simply ragtop
busses that had been converted prior to shipping (am I right?).

 He also really wants to have the massive moon roof... so buying a neglected Westfalia, converting it into a
Weekender with a rag top is really looking like a good option for him.

You are confusing years and body styles.

67 and back buses, split screen buses, came with a large rag top for the sun roof. The Westfalia buses had
small pop tops, about 2' x 2'.

68-72 sun roof buses had large metal sun roofs. NOT rag tops.
The metal panel dropped down and slid back into the area between the outer skin and the inner roof area.

68 was the 1st year of the full Westfalia roofs, with the front 2/3's being the pop top section, hinged in the
front. The lasted until the end of 73 yr model. The 68-72 Westys were originally sun roof buses. 73 was the
1st year it was not.

74 to 79, the pop tops reversed, with rear hinged pop top taking up about 80% of the roof.

There are no factory 68-79 bay rag top buses. But there is a company making them to put on.
