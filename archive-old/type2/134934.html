Subject: Re: [T2] Vacuum Idle Retard connection - 71 DP

&gt; On the flat side of the can is a hose fitting - for the larger
&gt; (4.5mm GREEN) hose. This is the RETARD side.

We agree here.

&gt; Second, on the cone (or rounded) side of the can is
&gt; the smaller hose fitting. This uses a 3.5mm hose,
&gt; usually black. This is the ADVANCE side.

We agree here.

&gt; Third, look at your 34PICT Carburetor. The fitting on
&gt; the LEFT side of the carb is for the ADVANCE side of
&gt; your Vaccum can. Connect appropriately.

We agree here.

&gt; Fourth, look at your 34PICT Carb again. On the rear
&gt; (RIR) of the carb should be a fitting up towards, but
&gt; not on the carburetor top. This push-on fitting is
&gt; just slightly larger than then one on the side. This
&gt; is for your RETARD side of your Vacuum can. Connect
&gt; appropriately with the 4.5mm Green Hose. &quot;&lt;

We disagree here.

How can you get retard vacuum from above the throttle plate. When the 
thottle is closed i.e. your foot is off the accel and the engine is 
cranking, you create vacuum in the manifold. This is where the port should 
and is located, in the manifold.


&gt; So which is it? Who can sya definitively???

&gt; This is wrong. The retard goes to the manifold&lt;&lt;
