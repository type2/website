&gt; Anybody have any idea what's going on here?  It's not the fuel pump,
&gt; because that clearly runs.  I think (but correct me if I'm wrong), 
&gt; it's not the double relay, because running the fuel pump from the AFM 
&gt; proves out the relay also (I think).

That sounds right to me, but you're not running the fuel pump from the 
AFM, you're shorting out the line *as if* the AFM was in the system.  So 
the problem could be either a bad connection at the wiring harness/AFM 
connection or within the AFM itself.  

&gt; And it's apparently not the fuel pressure regulator, because it holds 
&gt; the fuel pressure from the time I run the pump until I get the AFM 
&gt; reconnected, walk up front, and hit the starter.

Not necessarily.  The &quot;startup&quot; could be coming from the cold start 
valve's initial squirt (from minor residual pressure) without enough 
pressure to keep it running.  Unlikely, but spend $10-$15 to make 
yourself a pressure guage and check it out.

&gt; Eh, it's probably not the fuel system at all.  I'm probably just leading
&gt; myself on a wild goose chase, but if anyone has any suggestions, I'd 
&gt; be glad to hear 'em.

No, sounds like fuel.  Start with the pressure check.  Run the fuel pump 
with the gauge attached, look for proper pressure, turn off the pump and 
watch for proper pressure maintenance.  If that's all OK, then fire her 
up and check the gauge again.  Could be harness, AFM, maybe even filter.
