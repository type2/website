Subject: Re: [T2] FI Update... Again. Very close now, but not
  quitethereyet.

&gt;From: scott lyons

&gt;Does it matter that the stock FI system has twice as much surface area in
&gt;the return/flow lines than the system with the tee? I am thinking that the
&gt;more efficient your fuel pump, the more of a problem this becomes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ah ha new senerio. Possibly volume is related to the time it takes to reach 
the pressure(restriction). The return line should be pumping into the tank 
with less effort, but on the other hand the pump is aiding that restriction 
by sucking directy from the line as opposed to through the tank. With his 
pressure being higher than normal I would say that this is not the case 
unless the restriction is at the tank itself. If the pressure needed is 
constant than the volume has to be there. By this I am saying that there 
could be a problem if the return line(excess pressure), is not releasing 
fast enough then the system could build up to above normal pressure. Hard to 
tell though considering when the fuel passes the regulator it hits the point 
where it loses pressure and enters the tank or becomes part of the negative 
pressure that renters the line to the pump.

What are the differences in the sizes of the inlet and outlet nipples? As 
long as the single oulet tank is the same size as the fuel line of the 
system it wouls be okay, but if this one is half the size(smaller) then 
there could be a problem in theory. But it should work in theory as well.

TravelOn,

Michael Knight
