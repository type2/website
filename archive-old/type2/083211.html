I made an AutoCad drawing that shows where to drill the hole, when I
installed mine (VDO gauge and sender).  I can email the drawing to you, if
you like.  You will need AutoCad or a compatible viewer.

I can also describe it as follows:

Location of hole center: 1 1/16&quot; from the center of the sump plate, located
on a radius line angled midway between the radius lines of any two adjacent
sump plate mounting stud holes.

Hole diameter: 0.52&quot;

Hi everybody,

I got a oil temp. gauge with sump plate sender for my
1600 engine. It seems that the general concensus is
that the sender should not replace the drain plug and
should be installed somewhere else on the plate. My
question is, Where do I need to drill the hole for the
sender?

Thanks a lot for your help,

Rogelio
