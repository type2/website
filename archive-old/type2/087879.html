Subject: Swivel seat

I have 86 Vanagon seats in my 79, and now that I'm getting rid of the
rear-facing wooden seat I'm hoping to be able to convert my passenger
seat to a swivel seat. Can anyone tell me whether I can simply remove
the swivel hardware from a salvage yard camper and attach it to my
existing seat? Or would I have to get the entire seat?
Thanks,
