&gt;As I said, please don't do it.  Sell the Bus you have, and get one
&gt;that's already been hacked into a camper, if the money won't stretch
&gt;for a real Westy. Dunno about the U.S., but original Buses have
&gt;already become awfully rare here -- as rare as original Panel Vans. 
&gt;Hacked campers OTOH are a dime a dozen.

Here in the southeast US the market is just the opposite.  Passenger 
bay buses are a dime a dozen.  Two years ago I sold a complete 1972 
sunroof bus with blown engine and good tranny for $350.  Last year I 
sold a 1972 driver with good engine &amp; tranny for $400.  I couldn't even 
get the $500 I was asking for it.

I doubt anyone in the southeast US would mourn the loss of another 
passenger bus.  It is hard to give one away here.

If anyone is interested in a 1973-79 passenger bus, there is one for 
sale at the corner of Powder Springs Road and Macland Road in Marietta, 
GA &amp; I doubt they want over $1000 for it.
