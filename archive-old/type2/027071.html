I tested my new dipstick sender and VDO gauge from Bus Boys last night.  The 
new gauge is marked at 180. 220, 260 &amp; 300 and it reads just a hair below 
220 when the water boils (sender tip suspended in the water, not touching 
the pan).  That sounds like an accurate gauge (at the boiling point anyway). 
  The old relief-valve-type sender and old gauge (180, 210, 250, 300) read 
much lower at the boiling point, at just over 180.  I think I will swap the 
wires to the senders this evening and see if the old gauge reads the same as 
the new one when paired with the dip stick sender.  The wire runs are 
exactly the same length &amp; gauge &amp; path.

Also, I got a oil pressure sender that maintains the idiot light.  I get 10 
psi at idle, when cold and up to 50-60 psi at highway speed until the oil 
heats up.  Then I get a slight flikering light and just under 10 psi at 
idle.  I've been breaking my engine in with Chevron 30 weight.  Just over 
700 miles now and I've changed the oil twice -- every 300 miles.  It's so 
easy to change the oil that when 600 miles rolled around I pulled over at 
the next exit and just did it, closed the lid on the re-cycleable container 
and dropped it off at the next Chevron station.  Never would consider doing 
that in one of my water-cooled V8s that hold 6 to 7 quarts.  I love this 
bus.

On another subject: Dr. Tim, you mentioned that the Gen light in the 
instrument cluster should be changed when going to an alternator.  How do I 
know if this has been done?  Mine has an alternator

Also, a big thanks to Mark Deering (Salem Import Service in VA) for coming 
to my rescue with '71-only firewall tin for my DP/Doghouse conversion.  
Thank goodness he didn't sell it at Bristol.  My camper will be running 
cooler next week.
