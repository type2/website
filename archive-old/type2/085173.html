Subject: Re: [T2] pit thoughts

In my youth, I lived up in the Iron Range of northern Minnesota.

 In the neighborhood, was a railroad yard, of the DM&amp;IR--( Whats That? )

And over in this yard was a huge wooden ramp set-up, where the RR guys
would service their trucks---I'm 6'1&quot; and I stood up with no problem
when I had some work to do.

I know this is the exact reverse of a pit---but I sure used the heck out
of this free &quot;Up in the air&quot; deal, whenever I worked on the exhaust, or
GOF&quot;ed  my car-----pretty darn handy--

Again, a pit has it's limitations, but would be real neat in some
applications---


Later,

Terry

I wonder if you built the pit correctly and up to code would it cost
just as much to buy a lift?

Second thoughts on a &quot;pit&quot;: If you're working on VW's primarily, drop-
ping the engine would be at least as difficult as on level ground. You'd
only have a hole slightly less in width as the inner wheel spacing and a
transmission-type jack would be required to let it down. Then move the
bus to get it out of the pit...repair the engine...load it back on the
jack...drop it into the pit...roll the bus back over the pit...lift and
install engine...Nah...Not worth the effort to put the pit in. Save that
money and put it towards an electric lift...
