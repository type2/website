Subject: G.V.W.R.=Actual weight???

First off...my apologies for the hastily written post RE: Weight of an '80
Westy(please no hall of shame!!!) I was trying to put the deal together _at_ work
&amp; was pressed for time. Anyway...maybe someone could clear up something for me
that seems like it should be pretty straight forward. I've seen posts on the
archives listing the vanagon at anywhere from 3,200-5,000+ lbs. w/ the camper
stuff weighing in at about 200lbs. The sticker on the inside of the drivers
door lists it at 5,093 GVWR??? Is the actual weight &amp; the GVWR different???
Seems kind of high to me... Still need to give the shipper an actual weight-We
gave him an estimate of 3,200lbs. (I know it's low but he thought we could
swing it) Any Adventurewagen owners out there wanna' ponder a guess as to how
much their camper stuff weighs??? Any clarification would be great!!!
TIA
