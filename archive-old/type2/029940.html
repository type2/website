Some things about the 68 free parts bus I got a couple weeks back.
Mcode plate
12 6E                     June 12? (What the heck is with the E?)
21       425 508 525      Sales code?, US Spec, Pass wing?, 3 pt belts          
UL 2211 522160 8177874    US ? 8 Seat, Color?? Red seats? 
                          68 vin 177874

It seems like it was originally yellow (a greensish yellow) at least on
the lower half.
Yellow with red seats? Creepy. 

A few unusual things.
-Drug stash in spare tire well. Found a baggie with 2 pipes and 2 scales,
some unidentified folded papers and things and a cap from a coke vial.
-Has these locking mechanisms on the wing windows. I will get pix of them.
-Home brew camper interior complete with running water and propane stove
with tank and regulator in closet in rear.
-Has a firewall. So I suppose this change actually happened in 68 sometime
for those that care about these things.
-It was a deluxe and many of the deluxe bits are there, seat trims vent
channels to rear some of the beltline etc. I dont want any of this and
is avail for the cost of shipping.
-Headliner was suprisingly intact as are the hatch hinge covers although
they are pretty yellowed.
-The dash is about 100x nicer than my 68s as well as the steering wheel
although the bus is a real piece of rot mechanically.
Thats all for now.
