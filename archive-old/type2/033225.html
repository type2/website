&gt; What if any thing where you missing from the swap of engine parts?

I just installed one for a friend.  Looks like they did a decent job
building it, though we had to ship one head bck to have it welded where it
was cracked around one of the exhaust stud bosses.  We recieved it back,
and another was cracked... they had no problem accepting the head back for
repair, and paid for shipping.  they also included all the new gaskets
needed (i DID remind them to, of course...;)

You will need to set your endplay, ours (w/o adjustment) was so tight the
engine was seized up.

The engine includes all needed gaskets, but you might wasnt to have a few
extra valve cover seals handy anyway.  Also, our valvecovers were AWFUL.
they both refused to seat correctly.  Their outer lips were bent inward.
I got one to work, the other was so bad tha ti put a different cover on.

Also, some of the sheet metal screw holes were drilled and tapped for
larger (and not on hand) bolts, so watch out for that.

the engine we ordered came with a nice german electric fuel pump, no wires
though. a FI case, apparently, since the fump area was all blocked off.

&gt; Is it worth the extra $40. to go with the 1800 instead of the 1700?

When eric ordered his, it was the same price.  
 Dunno if its worth it or not.;)

I cant think of anything else off the top of my head...


goodl luck!
