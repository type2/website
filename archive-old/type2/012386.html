&gt;Is this a reservation Indian or the Hindu variety. I haven't seen yet a
&gt;Super made by either.
&gt;You can bet if I ever do, I will scrutinize them with a hand glass and a

They are the Hindu variety.  Commonly available through AutoZone for
about $0.95 the plug.  Now the German ones are as well, it seems they
spottily sold either German or Indian depending on availability.

I've had one misfire new out of the box and have seen em with ugly
threads.

For the money though I don't think you can beat the Bosch tri-electrode
copper or tri-electrode silver.  Those plugs last forever, can see a mileage
gain on a non electronic ignition car with a weakening coil or leaky wires
and are a great plug.  I'm not sure off the top of my head what the proper
plug for an air cooled would be, and there is probably no T1 engined tri-
electrode plug.  I tend to use German Supers mostly as they are so
damn cheap.

PS I'm not knocking India here, in fact the last Indian made Vanagon
motor mounts I bought far outlasted GERMAN (but not VW
the Pe? or something like that brand) motor mounts so long it is
ridiculous.  But the plugs have issues, in fact I think Autozone pulled
or sold out the Indian, then went back to German, and now no longer
list a W7CC or W8CC period for the Bus/Vanagon.
