Subject: Re: [T2] Sliding Door (Painting Question)?

Hi Kevin,

You can take the U-arm off, but the door won't stay shut without it 
unless you rig something from the inside to keep it shut. The U-Arm 
keeps the door in place.

Happy trails,

&gt; Greg,
&gt;
&gt; Actually maybe I wasent descriptive enough in what I am trying to do.
&gt; I want to paint the bus with the door on.
&gt; But I would like to take the arm that attaches the door to the track 
&gt; out of the way so I can paint underneath it.
