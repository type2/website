When I first start my engine, there is a very pronounced rattle,  sounds
almost like an exhaust fitting is loose, but all are tight.  I 've
checked for loose tin, loose pulleys etc. but everything appears fine.
As the engine warms up, the rattle only happens occasionally.  Some
days, I don't hear it at all.  Other times it rattles constantly.  Any
other things you can think to check, let me know.
ps. It doesn't match any of the Muir engine sounds.
