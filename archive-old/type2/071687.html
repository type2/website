Subject: Aux. Oil cooler fan (push or pull?)
X-Diagnostic: Not on the accept list
X-Envelope-To: type2

Hey Volks,
	Last summer I installed an aux. oil cooler in my '74 westy to 
keep the temps down and it worked well. I attached it horizontally to 
the frame rails on the driver's side, two feet or so behind the sink 
drain (yes, lots of feet of hoses, but my pressure is still great). I 
didn't want to mount it too low, because I do a little cruising in 
the weeds and on the trails and I didn't want it to get caught up on 
anything. There's about an inch between the top of it and the frame 
pan, and the bottom is open to the air. This summer I want to add a 
fan to it and I'm perplexed as to which way I should move the air.
Should it PULL the air from the small pocket above the cooler through 
the cooler, therebye SUCKING the heat away from the cooler,
Or should it PUSH the ambient air from under the bus through the 
cooler and up into the pocket above the cooler?
	I think my problem is that small area above the cooler. It 
seems too small to pull air from, and too small to push air into. Air 
does flow in and out of it, but because of its small size, it seems 
restricted. I don't want to mount it any lower because of ground 
clearance. So which way is best for my air flow?
Thanks,
Joel
