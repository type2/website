Canadian Engine Price:
Wade, gut feel is that the price is on the high side for what you're
buying. Having rebuilt a running 2.0 liter before, I don't think I'd want
to tackle one in this state (see question below, though). I would more
likely go for a new or rebuilt 2.0 liter, especially since the new ones
seem to be available. I might try to buy the FI stuff off him for $150 CD
or less, but only if I had assurances on that too.

New Engines:
As for the new engines, the thing that makes me most leary is that I'm not
familiar with the seller of the new engines that have recently come
available and there's supposed to be a 4-6 week lag time for delivery,
which is about right for a scam to go full circle. IF it were a scam, it
would bring in about $40,000 and leave a bunch of folks bitten. If it is
legit, it sounds like a great deal and 'too bad I don't have the cash right
now.' There may be some mechanisms in place to protect buyer and seller and
others may know the guy. I just don't. I known his domain name has been
registered since at least October, 98, but I'm not good enough to sleuth
out much more.

Question about Cranks turning on 2.0 liters:
Someone PLEASE check me here, but I seem to recall that a 2.0 liter can
bind if the flywheel and/or the pulley is off, even if it's a good engine.
For some reason, I'm thinking that there's enough play to make this
possible, but that it gets fixed when the flywheel and pulley get back on.
PLEASE DON'T TAKE THIS FOR GOSPEL ON MY SAY, I'm not sure if I'm right
about this or not.

Thank! Joe
