Gentlepersons-
                       In the MSC Industrial Supply Catalog 
&lt;www.mscdirect_dot_com&gt; there's sets
or individual &quot;salvage&quot; sockets. I'm sure they're available elsewhere 
(Grainger?), but they
work by tapping the socket unto the hex head where barbs bite into the bolt 
and hold it
for removal. Pricey, but if you shop at the recycler's or work on 20-30-40 
year old veh-
icles, worth it. MSC's brand is E-Z OFF.
