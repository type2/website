    For those on the group who may be interested in doing papar models, the
two VW's are available from the original publisher.  While they may appear a
bit high, the price isn't much out of line from other models of this level.
Both &quot;kits&quot; and shipping would be about $30 US, and they will take VISA,
etc.
    A lot of other paper models are available from
     Paper Models International
                         www.papermodels_dot_net
and information about the hobby is at  Card Modeling FAQ

Halo, John,

we have one of each, the VW-truck and the VW-Bus as very last papermodel
kits in our archives.
How-ever we could provide a laser color copy on the normal cardboard on
which we normally print off-set.
The costs would be EURO 10,00 per model kit plus shipping.
If you are interested, please send us an order per email with the exact
shipping address. We accept all major credit cards.

Yours sincerely
Siegfried Wolter

  At one time Wilhelmshavener M...   had a VW truck and bus available.  Is
there any chance there are any available, or the kit may be reissued?
