Eastwood sells some sort of undercoating remover...this may work.....

Chances are the PO was hiding something with that stuff...might have used it
to cover rust, or treated the rust and then covered with the rubbercoating.

Is it sprayed back where the engine cover is?  Might be OEM soundproofing.

&gt; The PO of my bus thought it was a good idea to put rhino liner type
material
&gt; in several parts of my bus.  Anyone have any suggestions on how I can
remove
&gt; this tar like substance besides using a dual action sander?  Any
suggestions
&gt; appreciated.......

&gt; Justin,
&gt;
&gt; I would think a sander would be among the worst things to use.  Once that
&gt; Rhino liner gets heated up, it will gum up your sandpaper very quick.
Maybe
&gt; use a flapper-type sander or a putty knife?
