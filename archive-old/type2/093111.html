Subject: Re: [T2] Valve guides


&gt;I asked a local machine shop how much they would charge for a valve job on=
=20
&gt;a Nissan 240SX head.
&gt;
&gt;They said:
&gt;
&gt;$120 - refinish/resurface valves, cut valve seats, clean (dip &amp; bead=20
&gt;blast) head, disassemble and reassemble.  Parts extra, as needed.
&gt;
&gt;$65 - Press in new valve guides (parts AND labor included in the price - 8=
=20
&gt;valve engine)
&gt;
&gt;$50 - resurface head, to remove any heat induced warpage
&gt;
&gt;$40 - test for cracks by (1) die and (2) blocking off the bottom of the=20
&gt;head and pressure fill the &quot;unknown&quot; cavities with &quot;unknown&quot;.
&gt;
&gt;To me, this sounds like a reasonable price to pay for top professional=
 work.

Reasonable sounding to me and I recently had a set of Corvair heads cleaned=
=20
and I asked what the deluxe treatment costs. My local guy's prices were=20
similar.

&gt;I thought I could
&gt;(1) elbow_grease_style clean the two heads (8-10 hours invested so far) and

My guy cost $12 each for Corvair head to cold tank them and pressure wash=
 them.

&gt;(2) remove the valves (it's at a friends house for the past 4 months to=20
&gt;remove the valves)
&gt;(3) have 4 + 4 valve guides pressed in.  Best price is at $6/valve guide,=
=20
&gt;labor only.
&gt;(4) lap the valves (like I know what I am talking about, right !?!?!?)
&gt;(5) reassemble and be ready to slap it on my daily driver.  ((right=BF=BF))
&gt;
&gt;Well, I ordered the valve guides and valves and I am ready to=20
&gt;go.  However, some little bird (C&amp;M Machine shop Alexandria VA) said that=
=20
&gt;if I press in ANY valve guides, I MUST regrind the valve seats.  This is=20
&gt;because the valve guides never go in like the old ones that came out, and=
=20
&gt;will be off centered.  ( never go in - comments ??)

I seem tor emember some Corvair experimental aircraft guy showing=20
instructions on installing guides yourself with commonly availble threaded=
=20
rod, etc. Do a search for it. You takes your chances.

Don't go halfway - get the whole thing done.

&gt;So, if the valve guides do NOT have to be replaced, then don't!!  Measure=
=20
&gt;the lateral movement of the valves per Bentley, don't replace them=20
&gt;automatically. I thought you would ALWAYS replace the valve guides, even=20
&gt;if they were in spec.  Just to have a set of heads that were as new as=20
&gt;possible.  ( always replace - comments ??)

Replace them if they are worn only. Unless you've got money to burn.

&gt;Another piece of advice is to fly cut the type 2 heads _at_ $35 each.  But I=
=20
&gt;look at these heads and why can't I just use the $.99 head gaskets,=20
&gt;properly RTV'ed onto the heads?? Won't this provide the proper seal, just=
=20
&gt;as well as fly cutting?  ( don't fly cut - comments??)

I think this can increase the compression ratio. Careful - ask someone more=
=20
educated than me.

&gt;And I am not, not, not going to replace the '77 solid lifter valve springs=
=20
&gt;with '78 hydraulic lifter valve springs because I really do want to save=20
&gt;some money, and I don't plan to rev the engine high enough to get=20
&gt;float.  ( use solid lifter valve springs - comments??)

What's the difference? If the factory supplied a different spring then=20
maybe they knew something we don't. Lift can happen at lower speeds than=20
you think according to Mackerle's &quot;Aircooled Engines&quot;.

&gt;And not, not, not replace the valve keepers, only because I can't find=20
&gt;them at Bus Depot ( valve keepers - comments??)

Not a big deal I'll bet.

&gt;And yes, install those little valve seals because they are only $.44/ea at=
=20
&gt;Bus Depot and I guess I can afford $3.52 ( little valve seals - comments??)

It's a pollution thing I think. Replace them.
