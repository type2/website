Subject: Re: [T2] Chinese &quot;BRUCK Germany&quot; SVDA Distributor

One of my emergency spare parts is a Bruck SVDA
VWC-043-905-205.  If someone has the tooling (or has
access to the tooling) to measure it's advance curve,
AND they need a couple of Bruck 205s to test, I could
send ONE to them.  For the help this T2 list has
provided me, the shipping back and forth is a small
price.
   
My bus has a Bruck 205 re-arced by The Philbin Group. 
I have no idea how far off its mechanical advance
springs were out-of-the-box.  I do know the Bruck 205
was &lt;close&gt; as I didn-t feel any difference between
the Bruck 205, and the Bruck 205 re-arced by Philbin. 
There was a striking difference between the 009 and
either of the Brucks.  The Brucks are squirrely.  
Both from a stop, and when on a hill climb, going 50,
flooring the pedal feels like an after-burner
deployed, when compared to the 009.
     
My bus is a 1978 2.0L Federal, and originally came
with a VWC-xxx-xxx-205P, IIRC from Bentley.
