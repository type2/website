These campers are not campers as much as like the current EV MV or 
Multivan.  Not quite those either.  Interior is a table with facing bench 
seats.  There are two slightly different versions of the silver 
&quot;camper&quot; - one has &quot;more&quot; of a raised roof(34C) than the later (34D).  I've 
had all three over time.  Earlier there was the panel van (34A).

There was 1600 fast back Type 3 and a 1200 Saloon Beetle back in these 
days before &quot;SuperFast&quot; lowfriction wheels - like HotWheels.  Had both of 
these.

Don't know what VWs they've done as Superfast...

If I'm lucky I'll manage to find all of them in the box I left them in at 
my Dad's house years ago when I went to college...

&gt; My brother collected Matchbox cars as a kid and has just rediscovered his
&gt; old collection.  He's getting back into it.  I've just started fixing my '62

&gt; sent back.

&gt; &gt;The Matchbox Volkswagen Camper, light green #34-B is 2 and 3/4 inch and
&gt; &gt;was released in 1962. It is stamped &quot;Volkswagen Caravette&quot;.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The Matchbox Volkswagen Camper, silver with raised roof #34-C is 2 5/8 and
&gt; &gt;was released in 1967. It is stamped &quot;Volkswagen Camper&quot;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The 67 has 19 windows; the 62 has 13 windows. I have moved them to a place
&gt; &gt;of honor in recognition of your project.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Matchbox also had a Volkswagen Van &quot;Matchbox Express&quot; #34-A that was 2 and
&gt; &gt;1/4 inch and was released in 1957. I have never seen one.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;Why is one of the campers stamped &quot;Caravette&quot;? Is it a VW term or a
&gt; &gt;mistake?
