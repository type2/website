Subject: Info WTD: Slug Bug VW Shop of Irving, TX

Hi All,

I need to get some info about the Slug Bug Shop of Irving, TX.  If anyone
has had any experiences with them and/or can do me a favor by dealing with
them, I'd appreciate hearing from you via email.  Their phone # is no
longer in service.  My '59 Single Cab (&quot;Zorm&quot;) and I would be very
grateful.  TIA,
