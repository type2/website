Subject: sliding door lock
Priority: normal
X-mailer: Pegasus Mail for Win32 (v3.12)

the main lock, the one that is at front of the door catches most of 
the time. But the lock, where it catches at the other end of the door 
has stopped gripping. 

Should it be just as simple as going to the wreckers and getting 
replacing the lock?

the jaw bit gets the bolt from the car inside it but doesnt grip until it 
so it just slides away.

hope you can understand
