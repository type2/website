Subject: [T2] Gene Berg Shifter Question

Good Evening Folks, 
   Has anyone out there had any experience repairing a Gene Berg short
throw shifter? My old '76 came with one, but the reverse lock out was
broken, and 75% of the time when I went to shift into second, I'd grind the
gears as it hit reverse. I've taken the thing apart as far as I can, to
find a steel cable that runs up the center of the shifter to a push button
on the T-handle (this is where the cable broke). At the base of the shifter
is a rod with a nub on it that would move up/down as the button is pushed.
I can't figure out how to get the cable out to pull in a new one. I emailed
the Berg folks about a year ago, and I can get it fixed for $25.00 plus
shipping. Does anyone know how to fix these things or should I just cough
up the bucks to have Berg do it? I liked this shifter, and would like to
put it in my '77. TIA , Jeff S.
