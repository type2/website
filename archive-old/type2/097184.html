Subject: Re: [T2] Recharging Gel Cell Batteries

[...]

&gt; For those who don't care about recharge time, It's simple to build a
&gt; circuit using a 14v DC, 1 Amp wall wart transformer and a LM317T voltage
&gt; regulator to provide a constant voltage at the float value.  The current
&gt; is limited by the wall-wart itself as their output voltage will drop as
&gt; the current goes over the rated value of the transformer.  You can plug
&gt; your battery in and just leave it on full-time.

If you don't want to put one of these together, Harbor Freight has a flost
charger on sale for $8.49. I believe it is this one:
