Subject: thanks, was alt. penetrating oil

Thanks to everyone for their suggestions on alternatives to WD40.

I am allergic to the fumes of WD40/Liquid Wrench and it sends me in to a 
nauscious and dizzy spell the rest of the day...

Will definitely try the PB Blaster and Kroil, and some tranny fluid.  Have a 
feeling the diesel and kerosene will trigger another bad reaction....

Happy Holidays,
