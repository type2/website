I have a large sump, a CHT gauge that I know is accurate and installed 
properly, an oil temp gauge that I know is accurate, a 1 1/2 Qt. sump that's 
painted flat black and years of experience driving the above.
 
&gt;  a) take longer to warm up your engine

Yes, but only marginally.

  
&gt;  b) take it longer to change the oil temperature in general 
&gt;   (stays cooler longer, stays hot longer)

Larger thermal mass, of course it will take longer, but only marginally.
  
&gt;  c) cool down your system more if the heat loss off of the
&gt;   sump was anything more than negligible (gut reaction
&gt;   says maybe a little, but not much).

All a larger sump will do for you is add more oil and a slight change in 
thermal mass.

  
&gt;  Along the lines of (c), does the higher volume sump that places
&gt;  like Bus Depot offer have a form-factor that gives you a lower
&gt;  ground clearance in the rear of the bus?  i.e. how is it bigger?
&gt;  is it deeper, wider, longer?  Some of these might effect how
&gt;  the sump itself transfers heat...

I've noticed no change in oil temp just happens slightly slower (maybe).

&gt;  Anyway, just some thoughts as i don't relish driving 55 mph
&gt;  during the summer...oh, wait, i live in san diego and it's
&gt;  almost *always* summer here!  Hope these fall within the scope
&gt;  of normal (non-friday) discussion...

If you don't want to drive 55 MPH put a CHT gauge on your engine.  Do it 
properly, put the sending unit on the hottest part of the head you can find, 
but not under the plug because it tends to leak and erode the sealing 
surface.  Before you install it check how accurate it is.  An easy way is to 
put the sending unit in boiling water.  This isn't the best way to calibrate 
but it's within the means of the &quot;common man&quot;.

300 to 350 degrees F is a good safe temp range and your engine will last a 
long time at these temps.  400 degrees or even a bit higher is &quot;safe&quot; for 
short periods of time or even long periods of time, it will just shorten the 
life of the engine.
I've done this over the years and have gotten well over 100,000 miles of 
trouble free transportation by doing it.

This only applies to a type I engine.
