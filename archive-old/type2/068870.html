Subject: Re: tire carrier

&gt;I have posted this before, but was unable to find anything out.  I am 
looking
&gt;(patiently?)  for a front mounted tire carrier that fits into the existing
&gt;holes on a 75 bus.  Anyone with one like this care to let me know the vendor
&gt;from whom they purchased theirs?  I would very much like to get a hold of 
one
&gt;of these.
&gt;
&gt;thanks..
