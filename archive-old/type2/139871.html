&gt; I do use an insurance company (Hagerty) that covers my bus at an 'agreed

&gt; because I have no problems with the restrictions.
&gt;
&gt; I am curious though... my regular insurance company (GEICO) for my daily
&gt; driver vehicles won't right collision or comprehensive on old vehicles.  Can
&gt; someone tell me what insurance companies will right this type of insurance
&gt; without the restrictions of classic car insurance?

I have a full coverage agreed value policy with Met Life insurance (yeah
the Snoopy guys) they had no problems insuring my bus.  do charge me an
extra $200 a year for the &quot;ageed value&quot; part but I don't mind. I live
right in the heart of a large city and all car insurance is very high
here and that really isn't that much.  I also had similar coverage with
Maryland Casualty (Farmers insurance) company

good luck
Bob
