X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

This evening I discovered that sometime since last Sunday night someone took
careful aim and fired into the left-side jalousie window on our 1970
Westfalia.  Every bit of glass in this bus is original, installed at the
factory, which makes it an even more bitter pill to swallow.  Except for a
minor crack in the windshield, all the glass was unmarked/undamaged.

Another example of the &quot;benefits&quot; one obtains by living next to one of the
most expensive universities in North America.  And yet another &quot;reminder&quot;
that being rich, spoiled, and privileged is no guarantee of intelligence,
civility or personal responsibility.

The missile that penetrated and shattered the tempered glass pane was
probably fired from a fairly high-velocity pellet or air gun.  It struck the
glass squarely/perpendicularly and penetrated to the inside of the bus.  The
angle, apparent trajectory, and surroundings are such that the assault had
to be intentional and at a range of no more than 10 or 12 feet.  The hole is
big enough for a .22 slug, but a .22 would have damaged and/or penetrated
the opposite glass or door and that didn't happen.

This is at least the fourth time in 8 years this bus has been shot by a
similar projectile.  In the past the hits have all been on the steel body,
but very close to a window or lens.  Nevertheless, the impacts have been
sufficiently intense to leave dents up to 1/8&quot; deep.

I made the discovery just at dusk, so will do a careful search for the
projectile in the daylight Friday.  Thanks to Nate Morse I have some
replacement jalousie panes, but the replacements never seem to fit or seal
just right.  Something else to fiddle with in the midst of the usual holiday
scrambles.

FWIW.....
