Some of you may know &quot;Chopper&quot; from the list. She just took a trip out to Colorodo in her 78 Westy (Made it without incident). She had a question that I couldn't quite answer for her. 
&gt;I have a question...... is the seal around the luggage 
&gt;rack really a seal..... and if it is bad would it let  &gt;air blow into the 
&gt;cabin even though you have new seals on the pop-top &gt;and the flat seal is 
&gt;also new.......... I nearly froze............ lol... 

I did tell her that the primary suspect would probably be the tie downs, but she checked and they are tight. The seal around the pop top is new, so it's so tight that she has trouble closing it (maybe leaving gaps?). As I have a '72 front hinged top, I couldn't really give her an answer.


Thanks,
