Subject: Wanted--full width bed

Bussers,

I've decided the Turtle would be most useful for me and my family if I took
out the blind side closet and put in a full width Z-bed.  Anyone have one in
New England for a bay bus?  Or at least a full width rear seat that can take
the conversion from Z-products.  TIA
