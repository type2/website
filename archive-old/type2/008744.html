Alright, we've all had it happen at least once.We have what we believe 
to be every tool imaginable in the back of our buses(no wonder they go 
so slow)and something goes wrong.The one tool we need is the one we 
don't have.So,let's put together a list of what we do carry.E-mail your 
list to me and I'll compile them and tell everyone what the most
popular or important tools are believed to be. Thanks and Peace!!
