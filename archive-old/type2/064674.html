&gt;Greetings All,
&gt;
&gt;I'm the driver of an '82 Vanagon with '83 two-toned blue paint. I'm the
&gt;original owner. His speedometer, odometer, and gas gauge don't work, but
&gt;that's no big deal. There is a leak in the sunroof, which only hits people
&gt;riding in the back seat. The brake lights only work if I step on the brakes
&gt;very hard. And as winter draws near, I am hoping the clock will start
&gt;running again soon, as it did last year. &lt;g&gt; We are in Kodiak, Alaska, and
&gt;have no VW dealer -- and we do have exhorbitant shipping rates. At present I
&gt;am most concerned about the exhaust system -- the catalytic converter is on
&gt;the floor of the front seat ... I can get a new catalytic converter,
&gt;silencer, and tail pipe from NAPA, but I also need a Crossover Pipe (not CA
&gt;type) -- which NAPA says is a dealer-only part, and which the dealer in
&gt;Anchorage says is obsolete. I'm feeling way overwhelmed here, as I haven't
&gt;worked on a car since I looked in my Beetle's engine in 1975 and noticed an
&gt;unattatched wire. However, I adore my vanagon and want to continue driving
&gt;him. My husband threatened with the idea of a new car!!!!!!!!! (He's got his
&gt;own car, doesn't have to drive mine.) Not an option, IMO. So I've bought the
&gt;Haynes book and subbed on here, hoping I will be able to learn something
&gt;about fiddling with my Van's innards.
&gt;
&gt;My dream is to buy up all of the air-cooled vans and Beetles on the island
&gt;... But right now I've only got the one.
&gt;

 Greetings Lotus, 

 I am supposed to clip your message above to just the salient points
but it all seemed salient except for possibly the dream part and I 
refuse to mess with peoples dreams.

 I do want you to know you've come to the right place if you want to
fix those annoying little items on the van. 

 My own van is a '72 so I don't have one of the x-overs to look at.
If it's just a pipe with flanges then any muffler shop can fabricate
a new one with the flanges from the old one.

 On my rig the only x-over is the muffler itself.

 Not to worry, there are guys around who have already done this item
so if you don't get an answer in a week, post again.

 The same is true of all the other items on your list of shame. :-)

 That leaky sunroof has to stop, it's in violation of some code.

 Get up there with a tube of RTV Silicone and caulk it for now, later
when you are in a position to take the time to do it right, the silicone
will come out quite easily.

 The speedometer/odometer are probably just the cable, tho there is 
also a drive gear at the housing that sometime splits.

 The gas gage may just be a fuse but I suppose you've already checked
it. Still, I can't see a sending unit being bad on that year van so I
suspect a short somewhere.

 Your van sounds like it is suffering from the same neglect that all
seem to get. The problem is that you live so far from California
where all the parts are stored. And the good weather to work on it.

 On Freight charges: I found out a while back that tho if I as an 
individual, want to ship, there is one price. The local business who
does any kind of shipping gets 40-50% discount on those charges.

 So you need to make friends with some type of Capitalist Shop-keeper.

 I'm just full of advice so hit the delete key when you get bored.

 The next item on MY list is you should start looking into &quot;grave-
yards&quot; for parts. 

 Even in the &quot;Terrible North Woods of Alaska&quot;, there are junk yards.

 A short story: a friend down here in G.P. Oregon needed an AMC engine
of &quot;such &amp; such&quot; type and wigglies. The local guys didn't have one 
but there was one in Alaska. 

 They have a computer system that covers the world, I think.

 He got the engine from Alaska for $300 (fair price) plus $100 add'l
freight. Had it in three days.

 My point here is you need to go see one of these local &quot;Recycle
Merchants and query his capabilities.
 He can generally find your year of vehicle somewhere on any given day.

 They are vicious and not house-broken so don't pet or bring them home 
but you should have a resource there.

 Sometimes the best resource for parts is some kid you meet in a grocery
store. All members of the &quot;underground vw owners club&quot;.

 The last part is from the chapter called &quot;Living off the Land&quot;,
for boy-scouts or something.

 &quot;Keep your ears and eyes open&quot; 

 Talk to people about their vw's and wave when one goes by. 
You never know where your next carby is coming from.

 On manuals: The Haynes I have for my Transporter seems quite adequate
for most repairs including an over-haul.
 On the type 1 (bug engine) I also have the &quot;Bentley Official Manual&quot;
but I don't think it would be of any aditional help to you at this time.
Maybe when you decide to rebuild the transmission.

 Last: what kind of mileage do you have and how does it run?

 Your beast may be looking at an over-haul soon, that can be expensive
on the type4 engine. Not by comparison to other brands of cars but in
relation to a type1 engine. 

 I'm out of here.      west
