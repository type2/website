I assume you have a dual terminal oil pressure sender.  Since the gauge 
was indicating acceptable pressure the whole time, unless the 
needle on the gauge was stuck, something may well be wrong with the idiot 
light circuit.

If the idiot light connector is loose at the sender, will that open or 
close the circuit?  Anyone?  I can't recall right now.  What about a 
short in the wiring?  Either way, maybe the vibration of the motor at 
high speed loosened the connectors/shorted the wiring?
