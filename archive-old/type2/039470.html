&gt;I agree with George - I've never heard of a Bus getting 25mpg unless
&gt;its all down hill. Twenty was the best I thought I could get with the
&gt;motor still somewhat of a mystery to me.

You can get 25 MPG if you use a solex 30 pict 1, 2 or 3 carb, with a single
port 1500 or 1600 motor, and everything must be well-adjusted.
