Subject: Conversion - Diesel

Hello all,

I may have thrown this one out before but here goes again. I, like many of
you am tired of paying stupidly high fuel prices and being the socially
conscience little bastard that I am, would also like to stop depending on
petroleum to send me rattling down the road in search of the next bus
campout or pretty horizon.

I'd like to turn my bus (1978 2.0L) into a veggie oil powered car and
finally get something good out of McDee's.

I know that there is an adapter out there to convert an opposed four to a
diesel (or is there?) and the rest would be a matter of converting a diesel
rabbit engine for the grease burning.

I have some technical ability and have a brother who has more than enough
and is just finishing up his dual engine Scirocco.

If anyone has heard of this being done either the whole grease conversion or
just the gas - diesel, I'd be very interested in hearing about it.

Thanks,

Giles
