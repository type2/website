&gt; Like I mentioned I am currently in the process of combining two green

&gt; replace it. I'd be curious what the body experts out there in bus land think
&gt; (replace? or repair?). Maybe I'll just get a bra and deal with it later as
&gt; there are a host of front end, brake, and electrical issues to deal with.

deal with the mechanical issues first!  the paint doesn't stop the bus
when you stomp on the pedal.   my advice is use some rattle can color
close to the &quot;Babyshit&quot; green color to keep the rust down.  but do all the
mechanical work and get it running right, then worry about paint and
bodywork that is purely cosmetic.

&gt; want a show bus, just a nice bus that can be driven as a daily driver if

especially if it is a daily driver, get it so it can be safely driven.

IMO, as always YMMV
