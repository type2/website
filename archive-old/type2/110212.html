Subject: Re: [T2] engine install question

&gt;&gt; went back out last night to finish the job and we've managed to get the
&gt;&gt; engine to within 1/4&quot; to 1/2&quot; of its final destination  (i.e., the lower
&gt;&gt; trans studs are currently flush with the hole they will eventually come
&gt;&gt; out of in 1/4 to 1/2&quot;).  we can't seem to make any further progress... i'd
&gt;&gt; like to finish the engine install as it is beginning to consume all my
&gt;&gt; thoughts...

Wiggle and jiggle - it'll pop in. Don't tighten dont the bolts to try to force
it. Sometimes it helps to take the engine and trans back apart, turn the crank
a few times and then try to reseat it. Also, make sure the clutch disc hasn't
slid one way or the other.

This is one significant advantage of dropping the engine and transmission
together. Remating the two is alot easier when you are trying to wiggle and
jiggle the transmission rather than the engine! I can easily lift the
transmission myself, but not the engine...

-Eric
