Subject: rebuilt trans into '65 notes

Hey all,

The last few weekends I have spent dropping my engine and trans and CLEANING CLEANING CLEANING everything in preparation for my new trans from Ronnie _at_ type2parts_dot_com

Here's what happened this weekend.

The gear puller I bought barely fit on the outer upper bearings in the RGB's, but it did and they came off smoothly. After pulling off the gear behind them, the passenger side axle tube slipped right off, but the driver side was tight and I had to give the RGB a few taps with the 2lb happer to coax them off. Seems like the upper inner bearing is tighter on the axle on that side?

Axle tubes off, I was able to use my fairly cheapie snap ring (circlip) pliers to get off the big clip that holds the axle shafts in, and the thrust washer behind it.

after that the axles pull right out. They looked very good on the shovel end, no pitting or scratching.

The fulcrum plates did have some pitting on their back (curved) sides, but I did not replace them at this time.

What is the name of the Gear/Carrier that the fulcrum plates ride in? The one that engages the spider gears in the trans.

Unbolted the bus nosecone from my old trans and spent about 1/2 hour cleaning the funk off it with simple green and a wire brush. Came out shiny and nice, regreased the hockey stick just cause it seemed like the thing to do. I think I will have to take the nosecone back off to install my new front trans mount's though as I don't think you can get it on with the nosecone bolted up.

Nosecone/Gear selection question:

It occured to me as we were bolting on the nosecone that I would want to coordinate the gears that the bus thinks it's in with the gear the trans is actually in. Not having a good manual, I decided that if I pulled the sliders back and forth until the hockey stick could access any of them, that that would probably be neutral, correct?

When in neutral, should spinning one axle in one direction force the other side axle to spin the other way?  My assistant said this was correct and that the differential fixes all this apparent craziness? True?
I don't get differential.

There were three paper gaskets stacked on my old trans where the axle tube retaining ring bolted on so I went with three also from my new kit. The axles fall under their own weight fairly quickly, but not haphazardly

Cleaned the sealing surface of the retaining rings to perfection and soaked hardware in solvent before reattachment.

Before I'm finished I will torque all bolts to correct values, once I print those values out.

Putting the axle tubes back on was the same as getting them off. Passenger side on easy, driver side had to be persuaded thru the RGB's.

We stopped here as I need new gaskets for the RGB's, boots for the axles and new front trans mount.

thanks for any comments, questions.

Billy
