Subject: Re: [T2] How to make a 72 rear bumper fit a 71?

I had the exact opposite problem.  I had a '68 -'71 that I thought would fit 
my '72.  I got it and the front one, with bumper guards, from a '68 at 
U-Pull-R-Parts in Rosemount, MN.  They were in about perfect condition.  I ended up 
trading the rear one for the seat that goes between the jump seat and sink.  I 
still have the front one if anyone is interested.  Make me an offer since it 
will not fit the '72 style front end on my late '72 camper.

&gt; Howdy,
&gt; 
&gt; To make a long story short I was sold what was suppose to be a 68-71 rear 
&gt; bumper.
&gt; Since I am in the process of restoring my bus when I received it I 
&gt; immediatly stripped it and straightened it and painted it and it came out 
&gt; looking pretty good.
&gt; 
&gt; Well tonight I put on the brackets and when I went to mount it up and to my 
&gt; disbelief they were approxamatly 3 1/2 inches too wide.
&gt; As it looked the same as my old bumper just less beat up I had no idea what 
&gt; was the problem.
&gt; So I went inside and did some searching and low and behold it appears as if 
&gt; I have gotten the 72 one year only rear bumper.
&gt; Its identical in appearence but the holes are located in different places.
&gt; 
&gt; Can't weld or redrill this thing unless I want to repaint it which I really 
&gt; don't as it looks pretty good right now and I'm also about at the bottom of 
&gt; the paint can.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anybody had any experience making a 72 fit earlier years?
&gt; If so what did you do other than drilling new holes which I would have done 
&gt; had I known before I painted this thing?
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas would be appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Kevin
