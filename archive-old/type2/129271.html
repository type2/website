Subject: Re: [T2] misfire question

 &gt; This is at idle?...or load?  WOT? cruise?
 &gt; How often are the thumps...1 every 10 seconds, 5 a minute?
 &gt; Does it do it when cold or hot, or in between.

It happens at idle and also at RPM.  If I hold higher rpms, the beats 
get faster, but there is no particular pattern.  The thumps are about 3 
every 5 seconds so it is somewhat noticable, however it's no really 
enough to affect the engine speed.


&gt; It is a long story, but I have seen spark plug ceramic &quot;poisioned&quot; by 
&gt; wd40...it starts conducting at odd temperatures and loads.

I am going to replace the plugs now...


&gt; Pull each injector connector and see which one makes it go away...same 
&gt; with spark plugs.

I'm gonna give this a try and see what happens.  I wasn't sure if this 
would really help cuz it would make the engine run funny anyways, but I 
might be able to identify the &quot;thumping&quot; cylinder.


&gt; Triple check the injector grounds.

They're grounded to the MS which is grounded to the body.  I should 
probably ground to the engine, but I'm wondering if that would really 
cause this...  maybe I'll try running some grounds to the engine anyways.


&gt; If you really have an o-scope, watch the tach signal and see if it is 
&gt; weird when you get the &quot;thump&quot; same for injector signal, but remember you 
&gt; probably won't be able to tell much by watching the injector signal....it 
&gt; might be going out to the injectors very nicely, but unless the grounds 
&gt; are good and the connectors good, ya really don't know.

Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.  The MS and injection may be working 
perfectly, but it could be something after them in the electrical path 
that's havin' problems.

Well, I'm gonna do some of the tests you suggested and see what I can 
figure out.  I'll keep ya posted.

thanks,
Mike
