Subject: Re: [T2] Alcohol &amp; Gas

VW tested these fuels when they first appeared (in volume) in the 70's 
and found that the normal percentages used in the pump variety did no 
damage.  In the 70's it was just known as gasahol.  The problem arises 
if you use an alcohol mix normally associated with hot rods.  Then you 
will have lubrication and heat problems at the valves.  As for what 
brands.  All mix in the winter months and you will get the fuel all 
summer long as well.  The &quot;oxygenated&quot; fuels are required in many areas 
of the country in the winter.. .  Check your car manual.  The VW 
specification (as with most mfr) is that no more than 10% be alcohol and 
that it meet the octane rating needed for your vehicle.  BTW if you are 
in Cal all brands all year around are blended.

&gt;&gt; Hiya List!
&gt;&gt; Had my carb dialed in on a gas analyzer today.  While I was having 
&gt;&gt; that done
&gt;&gt; the service advisor mentioned that one of the worst things one could 
&gt;&gt; do to an
&gt;&gt; AC engine was to run oyxegenated fuel.  The stuff with a percentage of
&gt;&gt; alcohol in it.  He says it makes the engine run hotter and actually 
&gt;&gt; seems to
&gt;&gt; have an &quot;abrasive&quot; (his term) quality which just destroys internals.
&gt;&gt; I haven't heard this before.  I searched the archives back a few pages 
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; found no direct mention of this situation.  So, what's the deal?  This 
&gt;&gt; for
&gt;&gt; real?  I'm inclined to take at least some of this on face value.  
&gt;&gt; These folks
&gt;&gt; have been in business for 33 years and are recognized as being the 
&gt;&gt; best in
&gt;&gt; this area.  No question that they do know AC.
&gt;&gt; The ominous part of all this is that he says most gasolines are 
&gt;&gt; blended with
&gt;&gt; alcohol in (named Arco specifically) year-round.  Shell and Mobil were 
&gt;&gt; also
&gt;&gt; mentioned as alcohol adders.  He recommended sticking with either 
&gt;&gt; Chevron or
&gt;&gt; Texaco.  It seems to me that these two companies DO mix alcohol with 
&gt;&gt; their
&gt;&gt; petroleum distillate gasoline in the winter months.  Will using it 
&gt;&gt; then harm
&gt;&gt; the engine?
