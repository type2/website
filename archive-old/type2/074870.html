 if you totally removed the EGR system and took it to a different
facility do you think they would know???

&gt; 1977 Stock 2L, AFC FI, EGR filter recently added.
&gt; 
&gt; So I took my bus into the test station today to get it smogged, and the
&gt; guy informed me that my EGR system is not working right, and he would not
&gt; test it. (I know that it will pass the sniffer, as I just had the CO
&gt; adjusted.)
&gt; 
&gt; He held his hand on the EGR recirculation pipe in the engine bay, and said
&gt; that it was not hot enough, so the EGR system must not be operating
&gt; properly. I pointed out that if I disconeccted the link to the throttle,
&gt; and pushed the valve all the way to the full throttle position, the engine
&gt; speed would rise indicating that the exhaust gas is no longer being
&gt; recirculated. (However moving the lever on the EGR valve all the way to
&gt; the left does not cause the engine speed to rise as expected, which
&gt; indicates that _something_ is wrong with it.)
&gt; 
&gt; He would not test it, and said I have to have it fixed first. I am
&gt; thinking about taking it somewhere else, as my feeling is that he just
&gt; didn't want to test it today as it was close to closing time. However I
&gt; would like to have it working right if possible.
&gt; 
&gt; I know that the EGR valve is NLA, however I am wondering what I should do.
&gt; Is there any way to service the EGR valve? If it is working right does
&gt; that pipe get really hot like he indicated. Should I try replacing it
&gt; with one from a junk yard?
&gt; 
&gt; Any advice would be much appreciated.
&gt;
