Subject: Re: Dual Kadron Timing w/ 009

I have the same setup and it runs great around 15 btdc. But then it requires 92 
octane. I'm pitching for Santa to bring me an SVDA and modified base plates for 
the Kadrons from Aircooled_dot_net

&gt; Subject: Dual Kadron Timing w/ 009
&gt; 
&gt; I have a motor with Dual Kadrons 40s and a 009 Dist. I am looking for a
  timing
  recommendation on the stock 1600 dp with this set up
  When it arrived it was set at 18 btdc and topping out at around 43 btdc -
  seemed to run nicely without any hesitation - I backed it to advance to about
  32 btdc and it is not good - hesitates sputters backfires and looks rich from
  the tail pipe

  I need some advice from people with this set up or know it anyways -

  any thoughts

  Thanks
  Eric
