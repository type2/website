Subject: Re: [T2] [type2] How much Vinyl for back of 72 westy?

&gt; &gt;I &quot;think&quot; 11 or 12 yards depending how well you lay out the cuts.
&gt; &gt;Ive done it twice and this is off the top of the noggin.
&gt;
&gt; I asked this question once and got a few numbers in the 12 yards range.
&gt;
&gt; I took a friend's Riviera to a local upholstery shop and got an estimate of
&gt; 12-15 yards including the top bed.

Good point. I didnt include a top bed in my 11-12.
