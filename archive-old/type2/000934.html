How do I test a spark plug to see if it's good?




If there's a problem on one cylinder, disconnecting the plug lead won't make
any difference to performance, or will make less difference to the effect
you get by disconnecting other leads. Do this one cylider at a time until
you know where the fault lies.

This may be a bad plug, but there are other reasons, like the leads, the
valves, distributor cap etc.

If it's not tied to one cylinder you could be looking at  fuel problem.

I once had a fault I was convinced was a bad valve. I took the plug out and
it sparked fine, so I discounted that. It was only when I swapped it for
another one, an old one at that, that power was restored.

Plugs can sometimes fail under pressure, so you need to have a spare to
check against.
