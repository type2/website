In my continuing quest to install a fuel injection system into my Weber =
carbureted bus I have yet another query: What would be the most =
efficient method to install a cylinder head temperature sensor on a =
non-fuel injected engine? At the moment, I have sealed the original carb =
pre-heat holes (2 on either cylinder head) with threaded copper plugs. =
Could I possibly tap into the copper cap plug and affix the temp sensor =
to this?

Thanks
Todd
