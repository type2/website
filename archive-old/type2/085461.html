Subject: Re: [T2] BN4 Pics, diagrams

&gt; Thanks for the links Rob, but I need pics of the late model BN4, the heater
&gt; manual is for the early model and the wiring will differ some.  I have checked
&gt; all the articles in the library but need some good pics of the wiring from a
&gt; couple different angles would help. Just want to make sure everything is
&gt; hooked up right as I don't know why my heater isn't allowing the fan to run
&gt; when the air gets to a given temp. Instead of the temp reg switch just cutting
&gt; power to the fuel pump to allow the air to cool some while the blower
&gt; continues to blow, mine is cutting power to the fan and fuel pump. It sits a
&gt; few mins while it cools and then cranks back up. Heats good just not for very
&gt; long.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Casey
