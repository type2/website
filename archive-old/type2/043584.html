When foreigners live in Europe they will have to 'import' their car into the
country of residence. This can give you a lot of hassle.

It all depends on how long you will be here for. I believe that upto 6 or
maybe 12 months you can still keep your car registered in the US (check your
insurance as well). But if you stay longer and have permanent residence in
Europe you must register. It might be wiser to leave the car behind and find
one over here. Remember that several US spec parts have to be swapped for
European approved parts. That includes headlights. So it all depends on how
long and as what you will be here.
