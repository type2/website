Subject: Re: racing steering wheel

When I got my '76 it had one of those small sporty wheels in it. Bad idea,
living in the mountains as I do, the size of the wheel is the power steering
system. And what was even more annoying, the wheel perfectly covered the
speedometer and all other guages, so I had to lean around to see them.

&gt; Anyone replaced the huge steering whell with something smaller

&gt; wheel. Just a case of changing wheels over or do you have to
&gt; adjust other things as well?
