Subject: wrong crank pulley/timing???

Howdy all,

After rebuilding the engine for my '71 Westy, I now
have questions/problems concerning the timing and the
crank pulley.  The rebuilt engine is a DP 1600, case
AE, distributor is 231 176 028.  Here goes.

1.  From every source I have read (Muir, Bentley,
archive posts), the timing for my engine and/or
distributor is 5 ATDC.  As per the illustrations in
both Muir and Bentley, the crank pulley should have
one notch, at 5 ATDC.  My pulley has three, I assume
to be TDC, 7.5 BTDC and 10 BTDC.  I checked the engine
from the bus (also timed to 5 ATDC) and it has one
notch.  So, where exactly do I set the timing
statically, and how do I actually know that the TDC
notch on the pulley is actually TDC?

2.  Also, in everything I've read, it says to get the
engine running to check the dwell, and adjust the
timing with the gun.  Mine won't run on its own, but
given enough gas, it will run at high RPMS and will
register a dwell reading.  Is this reading accurate,
i.e. can I use it to adjust my points?  They seem to
be OK with the feeler, but the reading shows the dwell
as too high.

3.  Following the advice of an archived post, I set
the timing to the 7.5 BTDC mark to get it going, with
the hopes of checking the dwell and adjusting the
timing witht the light at idle.  Well, from where I
sit and try to make the thing start, or if I'm looking
at the engine while someone else starts it, 5 ATDC or
7.5 BTDC, doesn't seem to matter.  It will try to
start, make it for a split second, and if no gas is
applied, dies right out.  If gas is applied, it will
run at high RPMS, but will not idle, and dies once gas
is released.  Any suggestions?

These seem to be the main questions in my mind as of
now.  I'm sure more will come soon enough...

Thanks in advance,

Blake
'71 Westy,
'59 Panel
