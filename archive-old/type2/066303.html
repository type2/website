Subject: Re: Dual port engines

&gt;I understand, and have worked on engines for a while now, but have never
&gt;worked on a dual port engine.  Although my motorcycle has 16 valves, I've
&gt;never taken it apart.  Can someone fill me in on the theory and timing
&gt;behind these new fangled wonders?

LOL! You're only confused because we call things &quot;innovations&quot; when we
finally start doing them. If VW had figured out the plow in 1971 it would
have called it a great improvement over the digging stick, and truly it
would have been, even if everybody else had long since got a combine. ;)

&quot;And another innovation is that you can steer it with your elbows!&quot;
