Subject: Vacuum hose for brake booster

What is the right hose to use as vacuum hose to the power brake booster?

When I hooked mine up through using the metal line I got a slower idle.
(from about 1000rpm to 700rpm). I'm assuming this is a vacuum leak.
I used some hose I found at NAPA. It is &quot;double reinforced&quot; hose. Although
it doesn't specifically say heater hose, I think thats what it is intended
to be. It is higher quality than their standard heater hose. It has a
thicker rubber inner lining and an the outer layer is red. They guy told me
it wouldn't collapse. I don't completely believe that.

I used it to connect the check valve to the long metal pipe that runs up to
the booster. I'm going to buy some more to connect it all the way from the
check valve to the booster and eliminate the rusty metal pipe.

What would be a better hose to use?
