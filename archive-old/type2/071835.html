Listees,
    While searching for parts for my 71 loaf &quot;Sunbeam&quot;, I came across a site 
for &quot;INTERNATIONAL PARTS&quot; at www.ezfindparts_dot_com. Has anyone used this site 
to purchase parts and what kind of service did you get? They have used 
longblocks for 71-73 Transporters. 

Thanks,
William
