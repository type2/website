Subject: Re: [T2] Central OR trip report

Pictures, as promised.  I took more landscape shots than I thought, and
fewer &quot;people&quot; shots, but if you've never seen the high desert, there
are some pretty good ones.  Plenty of angles of the bus, including some
of the '79 interior I put in a couple of years ago.... though they're a
little obscured by the kids in the middle of the pictures :)

bus content:
After threading with a few folks (thank you Mark) about my front end,
I'll be pulling the old torsion arms, and replacing them with a set
from Bus-Boys.  Following that, I'll be replacing the rear wheel
cylinders with new ones from BusDepot.  Lastly, Ken at the Bus Co has a
hub cap for me.
