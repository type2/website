Then I'd lean towards it being a lubrication/bearing problem.  That's
kind of suspect, though, since you've replaced the starter itself.
Assuming the contacts inside the solenoid are in good shape (which
should be a reasonable assumption for a new/rebuilt starter), I'd say
the next question is what happens if you connect a plentiful supply of
six volts up, and try to crank it?  Unfortunately, such supplies
aren't exactly common these days....

Looks like I'm stuck.  Next?
