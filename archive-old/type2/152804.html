Subject: Re: [T2] clean out crank case without opening it?

I have heard that diesel works pretty well. At one time i had soaked an oil
cooler in it, and it worked fairly well, but I wasn't able to see how much
dried/cooked oil it had removed due to the fact the oil cooler is full of
tiny fins and low visability :)
 good luck and happy bussing!

&gt; I pulled the breather-box-cap off my case, and
&gt; I see oil that has dried up (cooked?) and turned
&gt; to grease inside my case. I hope this is only
&gt; above oil level, and not throughout the entire
&gt; case...
&gt;
&gt; Are there any oil additives that will clean this
&gt; stuff out? I'm thinking about moving the engine
&gt; out to the parts cleaner, and run paint thinner
&gt; through it for a few days.
&gt;
&gt; The engine is out, so I might as well change
&gt; the oil again. Any suggestions for solvents
&gt; to run through my case?
