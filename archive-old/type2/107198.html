Subject: RE: [T2] Reduced power after tune-up

&gt; When I was doing the timing I noticed something interesting but I wasn't
&gt; sure if it was important. My timing scale on the fan housing has a
&gt; little red dot at 5 degrees. When I checked the timing, it was well on
&gt; the other side (to the right) of the zero mark almost past the 5 degree
&gt; mark on the other side of the scale. As I turned my distributor to
&gt; advance the timing to the red mark, the idle of the engine lowered. As I
&gt; read on in my trusty repair manual, it stated that I should check the
&gt; timing to make sure that it advanced as I revved the engine, it did not.
&gt; Does this mean anything?

Yes. it does need to advance.
At this point it would be good to know what engine and distributor you
have so you can get effective advice.
