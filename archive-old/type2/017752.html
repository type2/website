wrt the alt test: don't do it.  I have read that you can seriously
damage the alt by disconnecting the battery while running.

Better yet, check the volt at the batt when sitting still.
charge the battery, (flame suit on - jump starting the FI engine may
damage the brain - don't know, but I am not going to find out)
then start the bus and measure the voltage.
If the voltage is greater than the 'still' battery voltage, the
alternator works and is charging the batt (~13.7 or so volts)
if the voltage is the same as the still batt test and starts to
decrease, then the alternator is either not connected correctly, or bad.
take it out and test it at your local parts store.

good luck
