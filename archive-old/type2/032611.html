Subject: exhaust tin

Gentlepersons-
                       Other than the spring-loaded control boxes at the 
front of the heat-
exchangers, does anyone know of a source for the sheet metal surrounding the 
ex-
haust pipes? I probably know the answer to this already, but from the many 
that I've
looked at or worked on, it's rare that the actual exhaust pipe isn't usable. 
The tin is
the rust-prone part of the assembly and the reason the whole exchanger is 
replaced.
I've got some sheet metal tools (from working on hot air systems), and it 
would seem
to be replaceable, if only the tin were available. Any thoughts?
