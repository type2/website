&gt;   BUT....  &quot;Burning&quot; hydrogen and oxygen is an extremely efficient,

&gt; you should be able to get more MPG, because you're burning more
&gt; of the gasiline that goes into your engine.
&gt;
&gt;   Have you looked at the efficiency of a gasoline reciprocating engine?
&gt; Only ?%15? of the available energy in the gasoline is utilized, the other
&gt; 85% gets spit out the exhaust pipe.  If you inject oxygen, or maybe
&gt; even air, you should be able to burn more of the gasoline, and have
&gt; the combustion pushing harder on the piston, for a longer time during
&gt; the power stroke.

As a matter of fact I have.  The efficiency is more like 25-30%, but those
numbers are deceptive.  In order for an engine to function it _must_
reject heat to the environment to operate.  Second law of thermodynamics.
The practical limit for efficiency given present materials is about 40%.

Now, since the energy for this electrolysis device comes from a
gasoline or Diesel-burning engine, the best it can do is return 100% of
the gasoline or Diesel energy to the process.  In reality it will not do
that well, because the burning of the hydrogen is also subject to the
second law.  The best you will do is 40% energy return.

So, the deal is that you deposit $100 in the &quot;energy bank&quot;.  When
withdrawal time come around you find that you get $40 out.  Not all that
good of a deal!
