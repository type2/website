Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for part numbers for 050 distributor

&gt; The cap is Bosch part number  9 231 081 413, which I have for $9.95.  The
&gt; rotor is  9 231 061 628, currently out of stock but not discontinued.  (My
&gt; memory tells me that a more common rotor also works but I don't recall
&gt; which.)
&gt;

Sometimes it's scary... I think about doing something on my bus and it pops
up on the list! It's time for me to replace the cap, rotor, points, and
condenser on my 050. Anyone know the part numbers on the points and
condenser?
