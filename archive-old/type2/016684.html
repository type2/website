Volks:

I just can't wait until Friday...:)
My bus, and BBTA, and my son...and the letter I sent
about them are published in this Month's (January) Road
and Track.  Okay, just the letter really.  But it's
pretty cool.

The Text:
	&quot;I'm sitting here this morning moved (again) by Peter
Egan's drive to Woodstock (&quot;By the Time We Got to
Woodstock,&quot; November 1998). A month ago I drove my 1971
VW bus to Busses by the Arch, the annual Labor Day
gathering in St. Louis.  My 7-year-old son was in the
front seat with me, the moon bright, full and orange,
on a humid September night.  As we drove past the small
Indiana and Illinois towns, high school football was on
the radio, and the Cardinals and Mark McGwire.
	Although I was too young for Vietnam (thankfully) and
Woodstock (regretfully), Egan's words evoked what is
impossible to put into words.  What it means to drive a
car I love impossibly through a country which I love
impossibly with a blond smiling son whom I also love
impossibly, sitting beside me.  Thank you for that gift.&quot;

Egan's article was about driving a Porsche 356 from
Wisconsin (through Indiana) to Woodstock, NY and back.  

That's the big smile for today.

Dan

&quot;I learned this, at least, by my experiment: that if
one advances confidently in the direction of his
dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has
imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in
common hours.&quot; Thoreau
