Subject: need CV boot bolt spacers

I just checked up under my Westie and noticed the &quot;highly qualified
mecanics&quot; who replaced my CV boots neglected to replace the spacers that go
under the CV bolts on the drivers side. Of course, the passenger side has
them in place.   So, I need six of these spacers. Anyone out there save
theirs from their last CV boot repacement job? 


					TIA
