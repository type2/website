automatic or 4speed???

&gt; At first the fluid was real black, as if it was cleaning more of the

&gt; separate on the floor with the darker stuff in the middle and the fluid
&gt; surrounding that. I have never been able to detect if it's oil or Trans
&gt; fluid. I know trans fluid has its own smell, but I can't tell if it's

manual tranny's use a very heavy oil, auto tranny's use Dextron..
oil is golden to black color,  Dextron is purple

&gt; oil or trans fluid. If it is leaking between the two which one is it
&gt; most likely top be. It had a new rear seal as it was a new AVP Engine. I
&gt; did not replace my front trans seal.

auto tranny has torque converter seal which should be replaced whenever
the engine is out, sort of the way you change a throw out bearing in a
manual.

&gt; And the final question: I also have a leak around my oil cooler, I did
&gt; not use any rtv sealer around the seals when I installed it, should I
&gt; use some this time or has someone got a better idea on how to seat them
&gt; properly. How much should these be torqued to?

did you use new seals there, those funny stepped donut shaped ones
