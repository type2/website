Not a dumb question.

Put two nuts on the stud.  

Tighten them down on each other with two wrenches (turning in opposite 
directions). Do this at the end of the stud - leaving enough stud to 
screw in.  

Use a deep or regular socket to screw in the stud.  Whatever you use 
just be sure to turn both nuts at the same time.  

After the stud is seated take two wrenches and loosen the bolts and 
remove them.
