Subject: Vanagon gauge placement

Hello, I have 3 gauges (plus a tach) to install on the Vanagon. These 
are all 2 1/16&quot; round ones (Dakota CHT, VDO O/P and temp)
I am planning on:
- moving the stereo out of its location, to the right in a new hole, 
covering where the cigarette lighter is now
- putting the cigarette lighter where the 'silver socket' is
- fabricating a flat 3 gauge panel and putting it in the original stereo 
location

Oh, and the tach will fit nicely on top of the dash right in the left 
corner close to the windshield.

Does anyone have any innovative and functional arrangements they are 
happy with?  Love to hear about it before the dremel starts cutting. Thanks,

GG
