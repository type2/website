Subject: Scat engine report

Well, it's been about 2500 miles since I installed my new engine from
Scat.  The engine was in the original box from the VW factory in
Brazil, and is a stock 1600 dual-port.  The main thing I discovered
was that installing a new engine will show up the deficiencies in all
the peripheral equipment (carburetor, distributor, etc).  The engine
itself runs very well.

I had to replace the distributor, as I couldn't get it to give me
decent power without overheating.  Turned out the 009 was frozen, and
so did no advancing.  I put on a used vacuum advance unit, and that
problem went away.

The carburetor didn't want to adjust, and rebuilding it didn't gain
anything.  A used one that I also rebuilt had similar problems, so in
frustration I bought a new one from RMMW.  That solved the remaining
power and rough-running problems for a while.  Currently, the throttle
sticks closed, but that's a difficulty with the idle adjust screw
misadjusting itself, so the throttle closes too much and gets stuck.
No, it's not in the cable.  I just need to get out there and deal with
it (I suspect a spot of locktite is in order).

Now that the weather's turning colder, it misses on one cylinder until
its warmed up.  This isn't a problem with the engine per se, but
rather the carb, choke, and possibly a bit of timing.  Just needs some
tweaking.

On the positive side, I've noticed a *lot* more power than my previous
engine had, even before it ate the piston.  I now understand why the
bus was considered a reasonable cargo and passenger vehicle.  I can
accelerate with traffic if I want to now (although I don't, because I
like the improved mpg I get from mellow acceleration).

So far, I've been very happy with what I got from Scat.
