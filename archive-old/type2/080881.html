Subject: Re: [T2] Where to get fuel tank??

I went through the same routine a couple of years ago when I yanked mine
(from a 71).  It does seems very strange, when the others are easily
available.

Finally I gave up and took it to a local gas tank renewal place that cleaned
it all up and then coated it with some wonder goo that is guaranteed for
life.  A listee later pointed out that there isn't ANY goo he knows of that
will last that long, and thought it would eventually migrate into the
engine.  Could be, I don't know, hope not.  They do a lot of restoration
work for classic car types and their reputation is good.  I guess I'll find
out.  So far so good.
