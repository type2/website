Subject: Re: Bike, ski racks

Re bike racks- I carry 4 bikes at once using a rack I made that extends
over the front mounted tire (it's made from rear of a trashed bicycle that
has the brake mount hole in front w/ a bolt thru it to stop the bike SEAT I
hang over it.  The bike is stabilized by bungees which go to loops
extending from sides of tire and to bumper bottom; a bungee wraps over seat
and rack to hang it by seat.In back (over rear hatch door) we hung a thule
rack (which telescopes to any angle); this can be stabilized by straps to
the gutters or hung as I did from giant eyehooks that I Bolted to the body
JUST UNDER the lip of the rising poptop.  Works great in rear; I hang my
tandem from there also.  I DO NOT recc. top mounted racks; I made my own on
our 71 Westy, and it's a hassle getting them up there AND you must watch
out for low trees, etc!!
