&amp;gt; &amp;gt;I have come to the conclusion that the center pin is the cause of the
&amp;gt; &amp;gt;wandering steering on the 69 bus. What kinda job is this?

&amp;gt; You need a dift to remove the old bushing from (knock out from below) and some kind of clamp to press everything back together.

&amp;gt; I recommend raising the front end as high as possible before you start work.

While pounding will do the trick, there are more subtle ways to do it by
pressing out the bushings with various sockets and threaded rod.  You can
easily do this without raising the bus as you won't need room to swing the
hammer.  Hammering things overhead is really unpleasant!
