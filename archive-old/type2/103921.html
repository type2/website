&gt; Hello to all bus pilots,
&gt; I have been kicking around an idea for a wind powered battery charger.
&gt; Being of the artistic bent I like to make windmills from found objects.
&gt; My idea is to build a mill onto a 38 amp bus generator with a regulator to
&gt; prevent overcharging.
&gt; I realize this is not a size efficient solution but it could be dismantled
&gt; and stowed away while traveling.
&gt; Any thoughts on my mad scientist approach?
&gt; Does this sound possible?
&gt; What kind of rpm's do I need in order to generate a useable current?

You will need about 4000RPM at the generator to make a reasonable amount
of current.  You're talking about a big windmill and a goodly amount of
gearing to make this work.

For battery charging, you would probably be better off with a smaller
alternator that makes more like 5 amps of current.  If you camp places
where it is windy (Wyoming leaps to mind) it will keep things topped off.

Personally, I think that solar is more practical.  I don't like to camp
where it is windy!  :)
