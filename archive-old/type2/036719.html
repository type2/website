ok vw geniuses, come through for me.

this lovely bus hates me, and i it. vehicle runs, then
dies. whats happening is the air flow meter is closing,
shutting down the puel pump. when i pinch the hose from
crankcase breather to intake air tube ( between meter and
throttle body), she will run fine. as soon as i let off the
pinch, no more fuel delivery. there is a dashpot of
somekind mounted next to charcol can, that has three lines.
2 large ones- one to man vacum, one to intake air tube(
right above the hose aforementioned), and one small vacum
line. if i apply 25 &quot; vac to this, thereby opening valve, i
can let off the pinched hose. So, what does this dashpot
do, and at what &quot; of vacum should it open? why is the crank
breather causing this air flow meter to shut off fuel?? by
the way, the meter is recently replaced?? please help
me!!!!!!!!!!!

Danke in advance.

William
