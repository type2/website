	[]  Re the E-brake don't use it, or always use it. I'm in the 
	don't use it camp
&gt; 2-Thoroughly lube all external cables (brake, speedo, clutch,
&gt; throttle, etc.) using LIGHT viscosity oil.
	[]  USE speedo cable grease, not oil. No matter how light the oil it
will stiffen up
	I've seen gun oil freeze up, mind you it was below -55F.
&gt; 3-Buy a battery that fills the entire back of the bus, or one that is
&gt; rated for the space shuttle: whichever one offers roadside assist in
&gt; the arctic tundra (or Pluto, in the case of the space shuttle model).
	[]  Or use one  good battery in a tuned up vehicle. If it won't
start with 
	a normal battery , FIX THE PROBLEM.
&gt; 4-Get some SERIOUS antifreeze windshield cleaner fluid for your
&gt; reservoir (or empty the damn thing, as it's useless anyway).
	[]  Yes
&gt; 5-Carry spares of EVERYTHING.
	[]  Good if in the bush
&gt; 6-LUBE your door locks, or better still, don't use them.
	[]  Yes

	Note: What do I know? I've never started a bus below -40F
	and I've never started any vehicle below about -55F,
	so I really can't say I know anything about serious cold!
