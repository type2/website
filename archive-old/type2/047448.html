Meredith:

I'm a little confused... you say you had &quot;ignition&quot; after your first
stall, you assume you &quot;have spark&quot;, but you're thinking it's a bad
coil?  If you really have spark (test by pulling a spark plug wire,
hold the end near the engine, and have someone crank it over) then I'd
discount the bad coil issue.  You can do some limited testing of the
coil with your meter, when you get it, but bad coils frequently
announce themselves by leaking.

If you really &quot;have spark&quot; then I'd be more inclined to think along
the lines of what would cause your fuel system to shut down.  Maybe a
bad double relay?

&gt; My problem is this.  Took the bus to the San Raphael Swell in
Central Utah
&gt; and she ran great the whole time.  No weird noises and the gauges
were all
&gt; straight up where they ought to be.  Coming down out of a canyon
late Sunday
&gt; night, the RPMs dropped to 0 in a split second with no other
indications of
&gt; power loss.  I still had power and ignition.  She would turn over
but not
&gt; catch.   I managed to get my little boys home with the help of a
nice
&gt; missionary couple and I went back to her in the morning and she
started
&gt; right up, first time, no problem.  So, I decided to drive her home
with my
&gt; back up vehicle following.  She ran fine all day and then in the
middle of
&gt; the blasted I15 Freeway, she died in the same manner as the night
before.  I
&gt; waited for a couple of hours and she would not start [snip]
&gt;
&gt; So, I am assuming, I have spark, I have fuel, I have a new ignition
module,
&gt; and I am guessing that it might be the coil as I know that if the
coil gets
&gt; hot it might not run and when it is completely cooled it will.  My
bus did
&gt; start the next day and thankfully she is sitting in my driveway now.
I hope
&gt; it is the coil because that would be a good project for me to
tackle.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone have any suggestions for me.  I guess I need to go buy a
voltmeter
&gt; and a torque wrench to add to my tool collection.  Any advice would
be much
&gt; appreciated.  I really miss her and it has only been a day or two
since I
&gt; haven't been able to climb up in her and take off.
