Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Depot Blues....

It kinda what you get when you order from them. I have already this 
year ordered close to 1k worth of stuff and continue too. I wait and 
wait but eventually they get there. The only beef I have with them is 
when you try to call the 1800 number to say that something didnt come 
but was on the packing order and your asked to call the long distance 
number. Should I be penalized for something I didnt receive, I got it 
taken care of but the call cost me $1-2 more on top of my order. 
Other than that Im very happy with the service, the quality, prices, 
and the knowledge. Sure they are slow (Im still waiting on a lot of 
items) but who the hell cares unless you are in need of a part, if 
you want it faster order from somewhere else.

just my two cents.

&gt;I didn't notice anything in your post about trying to contact their 
&gt;customer service department to air your grievance.  If you haven't 
&gt;done that, maybe it would have been appropriate prior to bringing it 
&gt;to the list.
&gt;Just a thought.....
