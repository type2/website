&gt; You can do that, but first try the 2-hammer method.  With the puller in
&gt; place, put one hammer against the side of the pitman arm and give the
&gt; other side a whack with a lighter hammer.  The direction of the impact
&gt; should be perpendicular to the tapered stud of the rod end.  The idea is
&gt; to &quot;oval&quot; the hole microscopically and pop things loose.  It works for me!
