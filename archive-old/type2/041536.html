Subject: New Engine; Started!

Okay, after spending all morning checking wires, fuel, spark, air, 
compression, etc.  IT STARTED!

How I got the little beauty to start is unbelievable.

I decided that when the engine was cranking and the timing was set about 
10degress before TDC (left of the '0') to move the distributor till it said 
28degrees before TDC.  It sounded as if it really wanted to start.

I then decided to just turn the dist while my girlfriend was cranking the 
engine and I turned the dist. clockwise nothing happened...
I turned the dist. counterclockwise and it wanted to start.  Alittle more 
and it started.  I kept it running at about 2k for cam seating...
around seven minutes.  Then, I let it idle...checked the timing with the 
timing light and the dist. was setting about 45-60 degress counterclockwise 
from the dist. notch...and the timing marks are around 90 degrees away from 
the '0' to the right side... retarded?

What the heck is going on.  I tried to adjust the timing back towards the 
zero, but the engine wanted to stall...advancing it or retarding...

Help!

When the rotor was facing the dist. notch and #1 spark plug wire, while 
cranking the timing mark was at the zero.  I could set the mark 10 degree 
before TDC and nothing would happen...After retarding it starts!  Something 
seems real fishy

I'm saying I retarded it, but what I actually did was turn the dist. counter 
clockwise from the rotor pointing at #1 TDC 45-60 degrees I believe this 
means retarding it!

Lo
