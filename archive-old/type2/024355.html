&gt; Having heard about cot's for the cab area, does any-one have one for
sale in
&gt; the UK? Or can you e-mail a diagram/photo? since I need to think
about what
&gt; to do with Cameron when he's older.

  There are a couple of implementations of the same basic design. The 
Westy version has four sockets attached to the A &amp; B pillars with 
rectangular section poles that slot into them. The Devon conversion 
has &quot;telescopic&quot; poles that fit into holes drilled in the same places.
 Both types have a canvas rectangle which is slung between the poles to
form the &quot;cot&quot; (or hammock?) above the front seats.
 The poles in the Westy version seem less strong, but stow neatly,
rolled up with the canvas, above the cupboard behind the sliding door.

 I think that Q-B auto camp sell them (don't know which style) but
if you're going to be going to any of the VW shows I'd look there: you
can see what setups are available and probably pick up a used version
of whichever style appeals.

Cheers,
	W.
