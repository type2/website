&gt;Any suggestions on how to jack up the bus and then the
&gt;placement of jackstands.

Did your bus come with a bilstein jack? There are jack points on the bus in 
front of the rear wheels and behind the front wheels that look like small 
square slots where the bilstein fits into. If you don't have one of these 
kinds of jacks, I highly recommend it. It is a great jack that even keeps 
the bus up if the vehicle should accidentally roll some. I have seen them 
on ebay for not a lot of money. If you have a bilstine then you can jack up 
the bus and place the stands under the bilstine brackets. Let me know if 
you have more questions, or need a picture of the jack points.
