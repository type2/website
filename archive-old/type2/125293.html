&gt; Would be really ah, um, well, distinctive with shorts, t-shirt, and flip
flops... Or at the pool...

I was making a play on my name.  I actually lived in Gary, IN, the singer's
home town for about 3 years.  NOBODY believed that my name is the same as
his.  Well, my wife did, but not too many other folk.

I still get a kick out of the &quot;Bobby&quot; character in Disney's &quot;Extremely
Goofy&quot; movie when he asks himself &quot;Why are we always wearing these white
gloves?&quot;
