&gt;  &gt;  i want to make a new compilation of travelling music.
&gt;  &gt;  i cant remember much of what was on the tape that was with the
&gt; hubcap. :(
&gt; 
&gt; Andy,
&gt; 
&gt; I made that tape.  As far as I know it has gone missing and been that
&gt; way for quite some time now.  I tried to arrange to get it into the box
&gt; at EveryBus when Britt Grannis (of RoadCow fame) had it, bet that fell
&gt; through.
&gt; 
&gt; Here is the playlist:
&gt; 
&gt; SIDE A        -        ELECTRIC
&gt; SIDE B                -        ACOUSTIC

&gt; I know this list is prolly more than anybody really wanted, but if
&gt; anyone is interested in getting a copy of the tape, just p-mail me.
&gt; 
&gt; Trouble is, I can't find 100 minute cassettes any more.  :-o
&gt; 
&gt; If there is any way to get the tape back with the hubcap (and KEEPING
&gt; it there), please let me know.
&gt; 
&gt; I could burn a CD, but they don't hold more than 70 minutes of music
&gt; :-(

1. You can probably still get 120 minute casettes at Radio Shack -- but
they were always known for a short lifespan - tape had to be thinner to fit
the same reel size as shorter tapes.

2. You can get one back with the hubcap by mailing a copy to anyone in
Havasu before next weekend. Keeping it there ... depends on who carries the
puck. Driving a bus does not guarantee honesty and probably DOEs guarantee
some degree of &quot;absent mindedness&quot; (ever got to where you were going and
just sort of forgot to get out of the bus for an hour or two -- just
sitting there &quot;feeling&quot; the peace?) The original is probably in the &quot;Play&quot;
side of someones duplicating boom box where they put it before going on the
hunt for a long tape.

3. CD's hold 80 minutes of audio.

4. Burn two CD's -- continuing the them you started with the two sides of
the tape -- 80 minutes of acoustic and 80 minutes of electric

5. Drop an MP3 cd in there as well -- 10 hours worth (roughly) of mp3 files
saved at 128bit.
