Subject: VW Bus for sale in NC

Hey guys,

    I know nothing about this Bus, but I was searching for parts on eBay and
it came up under PARTS (rather than vehicles). Looking at the picture, the Bus
looks like it's actually in really nice shape and has almost no rust that I
can see (based on the pictures). Just by looking at it, it's missing the
engine and transmission, and the rear bumper. But other than that (and the
windshield needing to be replaced), it looks like a very decent condition VW
Bus. It looks like someone spent a good deal of money painting it and fixing
it up. It's a little crazy looking (maybe late 80s Miami Vice themed) but
still pretty cool.

Anyway, the auction number is: 160153612122


Again, I know nothing about this, just posting it because it's at like $100
bucks and no one seems to have bid on it yet.


Todd
