I looked very closely at installing one of these kits, but decided against
it for several reasons. One of which had to do with sealing the engine
compartment. Corvairs, obviously, are air cooled, just like 'dubs. But the
engine is a different size and shape. When I called Clark's and asked them
about how the engine seal is accomplished, I could hear them scratching
their heads over the phone. Perhaps inattention to engine sealing is one
reason the person who originated this post went through a VW engine a year.

Reason number two: Corvair engines are indeed low stressed, but far from
what the original post would have you believe, they are not common. Parts
are very expensive, getting more so all the time, and exceedingly rare. They
only made these things for 10 years, and the numbers were not anywhere near
the quantities VW cranked out. Try finding a fan belt or plugs for your
Volksvair at the local FLAPS. If you thought VWs were a novelty, wait until
you mention the word &quot;Corvair.&quot;

I plan to drive my rebuilt VW van, complete with its rebuilt VW engine, as
far as the road will take me. That means into other countries where they
didn't have no stinkin' Corvairs. Ubiquity is part of the beauty of the
VW--throw a rod in Argentina and you'll find five guys selling them from
donkey carts on the side of the road.

Yes, we'd all like to have 110 HP. But I think the days when it was
practical to drop a 'Vair in a Volks ended about 1982. My two cents.
Bob
