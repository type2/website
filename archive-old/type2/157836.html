Subject: Re: FW: [T2] S boot redesign

Alright, my you've finally gotten me curious enough that I have to ask.  What the heck is the S boot you're talking about?   Learn something new every day here.  Cheers...KR

making one out of rigid copper pipe like what is used in commercial
plumbing. Soldering on the fittings for the small hoses and then
connecting this on AFC and throttle- valve ends with the fittings you
can buy for connecting copper to ABS pipe in the plumbing trade they
call them &quot;Fernco couplers&quot; it won't be pretty but it will be air tight
and pretty cheap&quot; I'll post a picture when I am done.

Also another idea is using one from a earlier bus for the fitting holes
and then adapting it as needed with flexible ducting, like you see the
kids doing with their air filters on the Hondas and other Japanese cars
