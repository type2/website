&gt; Hi list. I have a question about mounting gauges in my  ' 79 westy. I was 
&gt; thinking about putting them in the dash, under the radio, and using the three 
&gt; gauge mounting fixture that I bought from Bus Boys. But when I look at it 

I was going to do the exact same on my 78 but a mockup taped there
convinced me it wouldn't work worth beans,,, so

&gt; now, I start to wonder if this placement won't be a bit difficult to see, and 
&gt; if it wouldn't be better to put them in a pod on top of the dash where they 
&gt; fall directly in my line of sight while driving. Could any of you with the 
&gt; dash mounted gauges please give me your input as to how you like the set-up?

so I ended up putting in one of the pods (got mine from RMMW) found that I
could sit it on the dash between the air vents behind the speaker grill,
ran the wires through an exsisting hole, it just sits there has never even
moved a little bit and it isn't attached, was thinking double stick foam
tape.   works perfect, easy to see and since the guages are angled to the
driver very easy to read.  

I highly reccomend that position, but as they say  YMMV
