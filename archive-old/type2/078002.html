Subject: Re: Tranny woes

If I sold you something that wasn't good I'd return your money.
I have four aircooled standard transmissions. I've driven and tested two
of them, I know them to be good but I ask $450.00 for them.
I've never gotten a 4 speed manual without buying the whole van and that
is why I'm so greedy about them.
It sorta goes this way............... Remove It. Change the Grease while
checking for iron and bronze. Install it in my van and run it 2-5K,
remove it when I sell it.
I calculate that the remove, inspect, change the grease, install and
remove process is well worth 200$ and we both know you're getting a good
transmission.

&gt; Probably gonna be difficult, as the guy is out of state, but I'm 
&gt; trying to.
&gt; 
&gt; You pays your money and you takes your chances.  If you think you're 
&gt; gonna
&gt; cry about the results, don't throw the dice!
