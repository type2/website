Subject: reasons for using oil

I have a 1776 running on a test stand and am trying to find the reason for
rather high oil usage. There is white smoke coming from the tail pipes.

I measured compression in each cylinder and found that values like 105,
125, 115 increased to 130, 135, and even 140 in the various cylinders after
squirting oil into the spark plug hole.  I don't have any experience in
interpreting these numbers.

 Would I be correct in reasoning that a change of this amount indicates
that the rings are not sealing tightly and  that the oil which seeps by
them into the combustion chamber is responsible for my high usage?

If not,  can anyone suggest where else I might look to explain using a
quart every 100 miles?

Thanks, Jack
