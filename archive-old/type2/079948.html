&gt; Sorry I don't remember the size - has been 2 or 3 years since I did that
&gt; job. Won't take very long. Will also give you a good chance to check the
&gt; elbow at the top - they all need inspection and most need replacing.
&gt;
&gt; I'll be taking a close look in a few months when the bus goes back on the
&gt; road.

&gt; &gt;Thats what I figured I would have to do. I looked at it and got the panel
&gt; &gt;out of the way. I initially suspected vent l;ines so they are all new. Do
&gt; &gt;you happen to know the diameter of hose you used? I don't have a lot of
&gt; &gt;time after work to mess with it and wanted to use the bus this weekend to
&gt; &gt;go camping.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The lower hose is the easy one - I'll suggest that you do it with the
&gt; &gt;engine out but it can be done with some cussing with the firewall out.
&gt; &gt;Disconnect and remove the battery (batteries). No sparks desired with open
&gt; &gt;gas tanks. Aircooled drivers and aircooled busses are in short supply
&gt; &gt;already...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The hose material can be obtained from a marine supplier (who sells boats
&gt; &gt;there locally?), a diesel repair shop, or NAPA (or the equivalent
&gt; &gt;professional parts store).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;There are plenty of cooling hoses that will fit but I suggest you buy hose
&gt; &gt;rated for fuel.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Seems like mine only required about a 20 degree bend and I was able to fit
&gt; &gt;a straight hose with a slight bend in it. I added hose clamps (I don't
&gt; &gt;think mine had clamps originally).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;While you are at it replace ALL of the vent hoses and fuel hoses, they are
&gt; &gt;easy to get to right now. It probably needs it anyway...
