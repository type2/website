Subject: [T2] D'OH! ..engine pulled a stud....

..went to retourque the heads today and noticed that the lower right
stud on #2 was very loose....went to tighten but turning the bolt only 
threaded the stud out of the case...along with little metal
filings....D'OH!!! The engine (1600DP Type 3) does not have case savers
installed. My question #1 is: what are my options? Should I install a case
saver on this stud, or get a bigger &quot;self-tapping&quot; stud? Question #2, do I
Have to tear the engine down to install the case saver?


Thanks,
Eddie
