Subject: Re: Camper Trailer + EGR


&gt;Thanks Barry but I have absolutely no need.  Ended up using that
&gt;EGR valve on the '82 BTW, hope the bumper has worked out well.
&gt;
&gt;John
&gt;
&gt;
yes, John, I am SURE the bumper WILL work out beautifully!!

Note emphasis on  'will' !!

Mr. Procrastinator here has that saved for a later time...

I am glad that EGR filter worked out.  I did pick up one more EGR filter 
with the piping system through the EGR valve.  (Also the linkage, thanks to 
H Steven's alert assistance.)

At home, I tore apart (disassembled) one EGR valve, and cleaned it up to a 
smooth working item.  The tube(s) after the EGR valve were clogged, so I 
trashed the black tin with the clogged tube(s). An experience in deductive 
reasoning and intuitive actions. (Like, 'how DOES this thing come apart!!')

Then I went to take another EGR valve apart and clean/reassemble it, 
thinking that if the first one took 'X' time, the other one would take 
'X/Y', where 'Y' &gt; 1, or at least 'X-Y' time. where 'Y'&gt;= 0.

Well, EGR valve #2 did come apart, in parts!!,  The darn thing (this a 
'family' list, right??) BROKE!!  It was too corroded and weak and would not 
unscrew as needed.

Morale of the story is, you cannot have enough EGR valves in your stash.  
Some will be fine and some will bite you as you do your reconstruction 
thing. So :

1) Save/liberate the EGR valves + linkage from the clean VWs you find going 
to the crusher.

2) If the EGR filter is gone, or the tube is crimped, chances are the EGR 
valve is cleanable, but more importantly, the recycled gas tubes in the air 
intake distribution tins might be clean(able), and this should be the thing 
to be priority for rescued. ('Priority for rescue' = 'worth paying $$ for, 
even if you don't need it right now'.)

For people reading this far, the Camper Trailer part of the reference:

There is a 14FT UHAUL Burro camper trailer on a 'lemon lot' in Fairfax 
Virginia that is pretty clean, and is going for $950.

It is white fiberglass and about 950 lbs.  Sleeps 4, 2 burner stove, LPG 
heater, sink.  I did not see the inside, but it is the cutest thing I 've 
seen since I was an 18 years old stud muffin at a dance at the YMCA.

If you are looking on the internet for pictures of this model, this is the 
one has a big red emblem across the front that says 'Vacation Adventure' on 
it. About 1985-86 I expect.

The wife of the owner said her husband would be back in town at noon, 
Sunday.  I, of course, will be in church 10:00 until 14:00 Sunday, so it 
will probably be gone by the afternoon.

If I were allowed to keep such an item (allowed by wife and home owners 
association) at home, I would NOT be sending this message.

E-Mail me off line if you might be interested, and I will be back on line 
much later tonight (gotta work) or Saturday.  Hey, Jeff S. this is right up 
your alley.  You have friendly neighbors, and a passion for the underdogs.

TGIF
