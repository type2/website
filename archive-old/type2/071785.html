Gentlepersons-
                      ...Posted inquiries about Duramix products on two other 
lists and got
a few favorable responses - all Canadian, though. Anybody in the NY/NJ area 
know a
source for a free trial sample?
                      A body shop in Canada responded that it bonds metal to 
wood - alumin-
ium to ash - and has stood up to autocross stresses...
                      Any other bodypersons (DIY/PRO), familiar with the 
bonding process...
Seems to be a product worth investigating.
