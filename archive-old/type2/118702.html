Subject: Re: [T2] oil leak from big screw in case - what's the tool

|
| I remember where I saw the inexpensive version: Sears. They are called
drag
| link sockets about $7.
|

I got one of the drag link sockets at NAPA but it was too wide to fit all
the way into the slot in the relief valve screw plus it was curved where it
enters the slot encouraging it to slip out. I was able to grind it down with
a Dremel tool to (1) allow it to fit all the way into the slot and (2) to
remove the curvature so the part that goes into the slot is flat. It is
still a little tricky to use because you have to apply enough pressure with
the palm of the hand to the head of the socket wrench while turning to keep
it from slipping out of the slot.
