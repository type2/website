Steve, et al,

I got around 880 mv on my digital voltmeter when I was driving around town 
with my new O2 sensor.  The readings were fairly constant, maybe 50 mv 
higher when going up a hill or accelerating, maybe 50 mv lower when 
coasting.

When I turned the AFM wheel a few notches clockwise (tightening the spring) 
to lean the mixture, it drastically reduced my engine power and 
acceleration, even though the O2 Sensor voltage was around 600 mv.  So I 
turned it back where I started.

Any advice?

Thans again for your help steve.
