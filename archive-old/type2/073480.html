&gt;So, I'm looking for an affordable, 12V DC (DC-only) refrigerator for
&gt;my bus, and the ones I've found are all too bloody expensive ($600-800+),
&gt;even for the really inefficient ones (80+ amp-hours/day).  The reason I'm
&gt;looking for DC only is that I've heard that DC-only compressors, as
&gt;opposed to
&gt;3-way or otherwise, are much more energy efficient, and that's my main
&gt;concern.

Just FYI, none of the compressors are really DC.  They are A/C compressors
utilizing small inverters to run off of DC.  Presumably sine wave
inverters, which probably accounts for the fact that DC fridges are so
expensive.  Sine wave inverters ain't cheap.

The three-way fridges do not use compressors at all - they use some kind of
ammonia vapor system (I don't know the details on how this works) powered
by heat.  When on propane, a small flame provides the heat.  When on
electric, a heating element is used in place of the flame.  These types of
fridges have an advantage in that they are very quiet, but they only work
well when completely level - a 3 degree tilt will mess it up.

&gt;
&gt;So, that said, has anyone tried out any of Koolatron's Coolers?  They've
&gt;got a 52-quart chest cooler that's 12V DC and the &quot;right&quot; price: $185
&gt;
&gt;Here's the cooler:
&gt;http://www.koolatron_dot_com/electronics/kool5212vcoo.html
&gt;
&gt;which is said to &quot;cool to 48°F below the outside temperature.&quot;
&gt;(basically all I would need/want it to do)

The above line is a dead giveaway but I checked it out anyway.  This cooler
is cooled by a peltier device.  I'm on another list which recently
discussed these in depth.  I'll summarize for you - they are much less
efficient than compressor driven refrigerators and will take hours to cool
down a couple of sodas.

The 48 degrees is a stretch, most people who sell these quote 40 degrees.
It doesn't take much sunlight to get the inside of your bus up over 100
degrees, at which point all of your food will spoil.  My advice - save your
$185 and put it towards a real fridge.

&gt;Furthermore, their technical FAQ (http://www.koolatron_dot_com/faq.html)
&gt;  says that it only pulls 3 amps/hour _at_12V.   While this isn't great
&gt;and while it doesn't have any control circuit/thermostat (as far as I
&gt;can tell),

You won't need one, because it will need to be on constantly for you to
even notice that it is working!  :)  Sorry man, no free lunch here.  If
they were that great, nobody would be buying compressor fridges anymore.
If you decide to try it out, make sure they have a good return policy.
