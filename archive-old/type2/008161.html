Hi volks,
               I'm confirming what Jan said about VW LT vans, and adding a little more.

&gt; They were marketed (manufactured?) along with MAN. The lion logo may well
&gt; have been the MAN logo. MAN is a manufacturer or heavy trucks and they sold
&gt; the LT as their 'light' truck line. I'm not sure what the exact link between
&gt; VW and MAN is. They may well be wholey owned by VW.

 Yeah- I dunno about the lion logo either, I don't recognise it as an MAN thing. I think some of the lighter LTs were available with petrol engines but they were really thirsty.
 In Latin America MAN trucks (that is lorries, not pickups) are sold as VWs so you will very often see big (5-10 ton plus) trucks with VW badges on the front. I think they are probably made in Brazil as the places you see them most (Bolivia, Peru etc) are supplied by the Brazilian VW factories.

&gt; LT's were also (and are still being) converted to campers. So you can find a
&gt; LT based Westy. These are fairly big. Too big and too much truck-like to my
&gt; taste though.

 Yup, ditto- not so much a car you can camp in as a truck you can live in...They're still on the small side by US standards but definitely big for European roads/carparks/garages etc.

 Incidentally the clock thing behind the speedo was a tachograph- a recording device to ensure that drivers adhere to the legislation on working hours, meal and sleep breaks etc. It records the speed of the vehicle against time and is a legal requirement on vehicles over a certain capacity (about 3.5 Tonnes, I think). Don't you have these in the USA?

 Cheers,
               W.
