Subject: [T2] from mechanical to hydraulic?

 Don't do it Court!!  Granted I've only had 2 type 4's  with hydraulic 
 lifters and none without, I wouldn't convert to hydraulic just for a 
 little bit less maintence, especially since you don't tend to rack up 
 miles super duper fast.  I could see it being a pain in the ass  if a guy 
 had to do it once a month. But a couple times a year isn't too bad. 
 Besides if you look in benltey it lists the intervalls for a type 4, for 
 valve adjustments, every 8 thousand miles.  I don't like the hyd motors 
 simply because they don't seem terribly reliable(lifter wise). On both my 
 old worn out motor, and my brand new one with new lifters,  if I leave 
 them parked more than a couple days, they clatter and rattle so bad you'd 
 swear you left your marbles in the motor :)  One trick I have found that 
 makes them work a lot better, is to run a 1/4 to 1/2  a bottle of the GM 
 engine oil supplement. For a bad case of loud lifters, or a motor that's 
 been sitting forever use a full bottle.  Just my opinion.....
 Mike
