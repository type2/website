Subject: Re: [T2] 8.5 volts at FI fuel pump - what's up??

Well, the voltage at the fuel pump went from 7.5 to 8.0 and then right to
12.*.  It started right up ! ! !

What's up ??

Well, I finally went to do what Richard Atwell said to do, which is check
the voltage at the double relay.  To do this, I had to pull the plug with
the wires off the double relay.  I really had to study the double relay
layout and the plug numbers to see if I could make sence out of them.  Yes,
finally.

I put everything back together, with a jumper wire jamed into the plug to
catch the FP wire coming out of the double relay.  To this I attached a 20
foot wire (this was some left over lamp wire that I spliced together to make
one long run)  up to the front of the VW, with my multimeter on the front
seat and grounded up front.  See, I really didn't expect to get much out of
the reading.

But I saw a jump to 12.* volts at the double relay and the VW started (and
died, because of a massive vacuum leak from a disconnected brake booster
hose!!).

I put the wire down at the fuel pump itself, and got the same 12.* reading.

I don'r know what went RIGHT.  Perhaps by removing and reseating the plug
with the wires onto the double relay, this gave me a better connection.

I'll bet that if I had just REPLACED the double relay that the problem would
have been SOLVED.  But it wasn't the double relay, but the connections (I
believe) that were the source of the problem.

So, if I had listened to Richard at the begining, I would have had my VW on
the road right away.

Thanks all, and thanks Richard.
