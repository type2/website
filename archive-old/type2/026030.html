Subject: Re: [T2] VW Capacity (1976 Westfalia)

Not a problem, I took a trip in June to California and back (around 4,500
miles with all the side trips) in my '76 westy.  We had anywhere from 2 to 4
people in the bus plus camping gear.  In Arizona I picked up a Scamp trailer
which is about 1,000 pounds plus we put some stuff in it, so about 1,300
total.  I towed it to California then back to Kansas, over one of the
steepest mountain passes in the US, Wolf Creek Pass in southern Colorado.
Not only did I pull the Scamp, but for about 500 miles, I pulled a '64 VW
bus fully loaded that had dropped a valve, the splitty might have been 4,000
pounds.

Didn't have any problems and the westy brakes handled the loads very nicely.
But I have done one thing that will help me pull even better in the future,
I have installed a '73 bus tranny which has much lower gearing.  My top
speed will be lower (I was cruising about 75-80) maybe around 65, but I
shouldn't have to shift down as much and my gas milege should increase.

I have also added some more gauges so I can monitor the engine a bit better.

Only use a hitch that mounts to the frame, not the bumper.  If you can't
take off the bumper and still use your hitch, you'd better find another
hitch.

&gt; but we're gonna need to tow a little trailer behind
&gt; twinkie. The trailer will only have a cabinet and drum kit in it, which
&gt; really don't weight that much. We wont be hitting the
&gt; mountains too much in the middle of the summer or anything like that, but is
&gt; this just too much load for a veedub? If it's not, since I'm putting a
&gt; rebuilt engine in, should I get a certain upgraded model, and if so from
&gt; where? Will heat be (more) of an issue?
