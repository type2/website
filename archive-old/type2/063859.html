Subject: rust rust rust

If you look at the Rustoleum can, you'll notice a disclaimer..something like
&quot;this stuff isn't very special...it's just paint.&quot;  De rusto the same.  But
there is a red undercoat made my one of them which contains rust converter and
which is very effective.  Naval Jelly is good, sort of a precurser to rust
converter..If you go to an auto paint dealer they will be able to give you
spec. sheet on how to treat rust properly... It is way more expensive and
complicated than you are likely to want to deal with.  For my money the best
course is just to be vigilant and keep after it..  You can brush on any kind of
paint you want, undercoater or otherwise, it will affect your final finish.  I
have brush painted top coats on cars, using good brushes and good paint it is
possible to get a really good finish.  But I much prefer to spray.  (  John
