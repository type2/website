Subject: [T2] Dash lights

Between the 2 of us, my buddy and I have three Type 2s ('68 crew, '70 &amp; '71
sunroof busses) with the same problem.  The dash lights on all three are non
functioning.  Is this a common occurrence or are we just cursed?  Do we need
to take the instrument pod out to fix it or should we look some place else
in the wiring?
