Subject: [T2] Needed: fresh air vents

Hi, I have a '69 bus &amp; all summer I've been driving around with no 'plastic
vent covers' over the fresh air holes (on both sides of the dash).  I
haven't seen any of these for sale at bus depot (if they have them please
tell me), otherwise, if anyone has an extra set for sale, please contact
me.

thank you,
Keri
