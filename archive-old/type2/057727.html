I have an '81 Westfalia camper that a customer left for me to sell, when he
returned home to Australia after driving it cross-country.  It is a
rust-free California van in overall good to very good condition.

Interior:  Full camper, with poptop, stove, fridge, sink, etc.  Everything
works.  Canvas has a rip at the screen but otherwise is fine, very useable.
Missing front table.  Drivers seat is ripped.  All curtains, mosquito
screen, etc. are present. Generally good condition.

Body:  No rust.  Minor to medium-sized dent on lower drivers side panel, and
a minor one on the rear hatch. Pumpkin color.  Camper inlet cover flaps are
missing.  Otherwise in very nice condition. Would be nearly perfect with the
two dents pulled.

Mechanical:  150k miles. 2 liter aircooled engine. One cylinder head just
recently replaced.  New clutch about a year ago, rebuilt engine about a year
before that. It was just driven cross-country so it's quite roadworthy.
Runs and drives great.  Has a clicking sound on sharp left turns that I'd
guess is a worn CV joint (about $35 to replace).  Also sometimes doesnt
start after driving a long time (typical hot-starter solenoid problem, $15
to $100 to fix depending on if the whole starter has to be replaced or not;
meanwhile a tap with a hammer fixes it when it acts up). Gas guage is
inconsistent.  These are the only problems I could find.  It is in better
mechanical shape than most I've seen of its age. I will provide parts at my
cost if buyer wants to repair the above. (By the way, it has factory air
conditioning, although it does not get cold.)

Price is $2850 firm.  This is a very reasonable price for a rust-free Westy
in this condition.  I'm in the Philadelphia area.
