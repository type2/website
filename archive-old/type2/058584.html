Subject: RE: Be honest... How fast?

[...]
George is absolutely correct about &quot;comparative cruising speeds&quot; based on 
uncalibrated speedometers.

Calibration is very simple to accomplish (see the archives for detailed &quot;how 
to&quot; instructions).

There is a wonderful peace of mind that comes with knowing EXACTLY how fast 
you're traveling at any given moment.  Especially so when passing through 
unfamiliar places that may have unexpectedly strict speed enforcement (dare I 
say &quot;Speed Trap&quot;?).

I often find that having the speedo calibrated allows me to drive faster than 
expected based on observation of surrounding traffic.  With the guesstimate 
factor removed you can drive dead on 60MPH in a 60MPH zone, for instance, 
without the need to constantly scan for pouncing minions of the law.

&gt;&gt; One factor that will really muddy the waters here is the inaccuracy of 
speedometers.  Mine reads 75MPH when my actual speed is 62, according to the 
GPS.  The cruising speed values you get in this informal survey will be 
suspect unless those who respond have calculated correction factors for their 
speedometers or are gadget freaks like I. &lt;&lt;
