this is more for the people w/ sliding door busses...

a &quot;long&quot; kryptonite (or other brand) bicycle &quot;U&quot; lock attaches nicely between the front pass. side front door and the sliding door. (kind of hard to describe and may not mean a lot unless you own a bicyle..)

this makes it pretty difficult to get it because even if you break the blass and unlock the doors on that side you still can't open the doors  unless you remove the door handles.. added benefit is that the lock is coated in rubber so it will not scratch paint..and you can also use it on your bike when you are not locking you bus :)

drivers side is another issue :)
