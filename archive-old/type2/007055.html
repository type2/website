you be better off &quot;smoothing&quot; the bottom of the bus with flat panels to 
minimize turbulence?

Might improve mileage at highway speeds. but the weight of the panels would
decrease stop-an-go mileage...The figure I've seen bandied about most is 15
HP to &quot;keep&quot; one ton moving at 60 mph on the flat...It's the getting there 
that
uses up the most fuel (remember the ill-fated 4-6-8 cylinder Caddy?).
