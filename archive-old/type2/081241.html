Subject: Re:  shipping  transporter middle 3/4 seat/chair



A list member in Texas wants to buy the middle seat from my 71 transporter.
He want's to put it into his 66 bus. I checked with UPS and their guideline
limit is 150 lbs with 130+ACI- for the overall package.  This seat would weigh
close to 100 lbs. +ACo-packaged+ACo- but would be about 170+ACI- overall.

Can anyone recommend a shipper to use from So Cal to the Houston, Texas
area?
