Subject: Re: [T2] trip update (5000 miles and counting)

Richard had a few questions/suggestions:

&gt; Moving to a thicker oil is a good idea. Why didn't you decided to dump 
&gt; all of the 10w30?

We were expecting--and got--some cold weather in northern Maine.  With 
temps in the low 40s, I worried that 15-50 might be too thick.  My VDO 
OP gauge showed 60+psi on cool mornings with 20-50 (non-synthetic).  I 
was getting nervous about blowing seals.  Maybe it's just the 
experimenter in me, why not 12.5w40 :-)  I've been very pleased with 
the blend's pressures.

&gt;&gt; Brazilian Bosch points were severely pitted after only 5000 miles.
&gt;
&gt; This has always been my experience with points, no matter where they 
&gt; come from. Have you considered using the Pertronix?

It seems like a good system.  If we ever have a bus as a &quot;keeper,&quot; 
we'll definitely swap.  I was surprised at their condition, though, 
because the Lucas points in my Land Rover were usually just beginning 
to pit every second oil change (~6000mi)

&gt;&gt; The hydraulic valves are nice.  I've been across the country adjusting
&gt;&gt; valves along the way, and it's not my favorite rest stop activity!
&gt;
&gt; Agreed.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; The bus has started &quot;popcorning&quot; slightly on deceleration.  I'm 
&gt;&gt; looking
&gt;&gt; for exhaust leaks but nothing obvious.  For now, I guess I'll ignore 
&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt; if nothing turns up.
&gt;
&gt; You could be leaning out too much.

What is accepted practice for adjusting to different elevations?  We 
came from 3500 feet in Missoula, through the mountains, and now are at 
sea level in Maryland.  I'm sure we're a little lean and don't want to 
pay someone with a sniffer to tell me that.  What is the AFM mixture 
screw really doing?  Maybe I'll tinker and run up and down the road, 
listening and watching the CHT gauge.

best,
