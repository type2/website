Thanks for that! They've got it down to $1/sq. ft. now.  And they  have 10, 20, 30,  etc.  pre-cut.  I may go that  way.  20 sp. ft. should be plenty.   Cheers....KR

only about $1.20 /sq.ft and comparable to dynamat.  works really well.  
they have a  thicker more expensive stuff now and they had the old stuff 
on sale a few weeks ago.

Well,  I hate to beat a dead horse but here goes. I've scoured the archives  and found all kind of products for sound dampening. But I need  something cheap. I'm a bit financially embarrased right now. I thought  about trying truck inner tube material as Mark had mentioned forming it  to replace missing engine tin. 
  
 Does anybody know of any  cheap material that could be obtained in a surplus store or scrap yard  that would help. I don't have to have complete silence, but anything  would be better than nothing. I just can't justify $30+ for a 24&quot;x48&quot;  sheet (or maybe that was for two). Egg cartons? Shipping beads? Please,  someone help me out here! Cheers....KR
