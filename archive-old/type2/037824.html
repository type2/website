Subject: RE:Front Brake Noise

To Patrick ( and anyone else with front brake noise), If it's a squeal, your 
pads are probably not semi-metallics. Mine used to make a &quot;wake the dead&quot; 
squeal every time I came to a stop. Now, when you're driving a Sage Green 
Westy, you're already attracting enough attention, and I found the brake 
squeal highly embarrassing. I just put semi-metallics on about 3 hours ago, 
and during a 20 mile test drive with plenty of stops, there was no 
noise/squeal at all. My old pads were in good shape too, just cheap ones. 
Also, this is one of the easiest jobs to do. I'd be worried about a PO that 
said it was a pain to do.       Jeff S.
