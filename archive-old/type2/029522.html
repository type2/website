Michael, Everyone,

First, this is a very saddening event.  It is, I am afraid, the inevitable
down side to trip reports.  I have been afraid for years that we would get
a post like this.  Eventually we were bound to have a fatal incident,
accident or murder.  I hate it, and I wish it didn't happen.  

As soon as there is an obituary, arrangments will be made to send flowers,
a card, or a donation as appropriate.  Please don't send anything
yet...  it may not be me who does the sending!

I don't recognize her name from the list, but that means very little.  We
get 5-10 new people every day and a similar number who leave.  The
membership of the list has been stable in the 900 member range for quite a
while now, but it is a rotating 900, not the same people.  Also most
people don't post.  It does not matter! She was still part of our
community!

I did some research and a story is supposed to appear in the newspaper of
her home town tomorrow.  The URL for that newspaper is:
http://www.nj_dot_com/news/ledger/



On Michael's suggestions:

&gt; I think there should be a better registration
&gt; process to be allowed to communicate via this
&gt; list serve. Like Full name, address, etc.
&gt; So that the list could be better used as a source
&gt; of information.

Well, as I said, the turnover rate is 5-10 people per day. If we took
applications, and verified the information, that would be rather more of a
job than I could handle. 

In addition, I (and the other admins) have a &quot;thing&quot; about privacy.  All
we have is a list of e-mail addresses, and we guard that very jealously.  
Someone with a court order or seach warrant could get it but it
would definitely take that.  We don't give out that list or trade it or
sell it to *anyone*.  As part of that privacy position, we don't link real
names and e-mail addresses. We don't save information on when you sign on
or off, and once you have left, you address will disappear, except for
any posts you have made. Those remain in the archives.

&gt; Don't travle alone and personally, I would never
&gt; stop at a rest stop. There are State Parks all
&gt; over
&gt; the country where people are required to register
&gt; their names and vehicles. That is a much safer
&gt; place
&gt; to stay the night.

Well, I have travelled alone for years.  I have slept in all sorts of
places... rest stops, truck stops, NFS campgrounds, Federal, State and
county parks, commercial campgrounds, and just the side of the road.  
Never been bothered in any of them.  But both this woman's murder and my
safety are anecdotal evidence -- the worst kind.  In adition, the sample
is very small and small samples tend to produce very skewed results.  The
Concorde was the safest way to cross the Atlantic, until last
month, when it became the least safe.

I *believe* that the odds of having a problem are so low, overall, that
there is no significant difference. Alas this is unprovable because there
is no stat that shows deaths per hundred thousand dividing between deaths
at rest areas, public and private campgrounds.  All we can do is toss
anecdotes back and forth.  I would expect campground registration to bring
very few benefits. The victim's name would then be on file, but expecting
a perpetrator to register or register honestly is more than even the most
optimistic police officer would hope for.  One bit of news is that this is
not the first rest-area murder in AR, and as a result of the last one (in
1997) that state is supposed to have installed cameras at all their rest
areas.  We shall see.

                           H Steven Dolan
