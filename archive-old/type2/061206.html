I've been through about a dozen of those hooks.  Through the '70s
and '80s I broke several pairs of those flimsy, brittle bastards. 
If VW made them out of metal, they would not need replacement every
6 months.

I solved the problem with a short length of bent wire coat hangar.
A large 'S' hook would also work.  Hang the wire hook over the coat
hook (button).  The seat belt buckle hangs from the other end of
the 'S' hook.  A simple, durable and inexpensive solution.
