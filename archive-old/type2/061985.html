Roy's dynamo don't and he donna'-why!
  'Gotta' remember Roy, the Generator, Regulator, Battery and the 
wiring work as a team.  When one member weakens, the game's over!
  The object of the game is to keep the system voltage within limits 
and for a 12 volt system it's between 12.6 and 13.8 volts.  The 
regulator tries to keep it that way however, it's only a team player.
  A defective battery, either an internally shorted cell (low static 
voltage) or an open or weak cell (high static voltage) will affect the 
game just as badly as a heavy load imposed by grounded wiring.  The 
opposite can happen if there's loose connections between the generator, 
regulator and battery.  Unfortunately, the long wires between a dash 
mounted after-market ammeter and the starter solenoid doesn't help.
  When all else fails, read Muir or take the problem to a professional.
