&gt; I am new to this list and I'm glad I found it.

welcome
&gt; 
&gt; I own a 1982 vanagon that has lost it's engine. I need to know if a 1973

want us to help you look for it..... (bad bad bad, couldn't resist)

&gt; camper/bus westfalia 2.0L engine will fit my vanagon. . I can get the engine
&gt; for $500 and it has been recently rebuilt.

first off a 73 engine would not be a 2liter engine but only 1.7 liter.  it
also would not be fuel injected but dual carbs.

it will fit however, sort of...would need a lot of parts from your
vanagon, not sure the carb accelerator linkage would fit...it would take
some cobbling to get things working, and then it would be even more
underpowered than it used to be.

also what kind of shape is the 73 engine in???  it could be a pile of
trouble waiting to drive you nuts too!!

now I used a 1.7 in my van as a &quot;keep it running&quot; while I rebuilt my 2
liter engine right.  but my bus is my only set of wheels.

&gt; My husband is a truck driver and has no time to work on it so I am going to,
&gt; as I have been waiting 18 mos for him to get at it. I love my van and want
&gt; it running again.

get the appropriate manuals for you  van, I would start with the Bentley
(or official) manual.  good luck
