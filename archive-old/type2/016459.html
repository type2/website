Subject: 70 body Giv'in away

Hello All

I have completed stripping my 70.  Now I'd like to pass it along to
someone for body parts. The bus is basically gutted.  However, the
entire body it there and in good condition.  Excellent for someone
looking to cut parts from for another resto.  It also has the complete
suspension.  So towing is no problem.

You can have it but you have to come get it.   A guy was going to buy it
for $150 but he's a little sketchy and not responsive.  So I though I
give it to someone on the list.

I have only 1 request.  When you cut it up, if you don't need the front,
could you cut it off and let me have it, my 72 westy had a crinkled
front.

I live in Annapolis, MD

Brent
