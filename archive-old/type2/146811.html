Subject: Re: [T2] 12V DC airconditioner!!

It is possible to get more cooling effect than the actual power input to 
an air conditioner. In fact, it's more than possible, it's essential! An 
air conditioner, or a fridge for that matter, are what are known as heat 
pumps. Perhaps the bext example to think about is swimming pool heating. 
Some outdoor pools are only heated/used in the summer because they use a 
heat pump rather than a straight heater to function. These transfer heat 
from the air (which only works when the air is warm) to the pool water 
effectively by being a fridge (working backwards). They transfer more 
heating power than they actually consume electrically, so it's more 
economical than just heating the water.

Another way of looking at it is to feel the waft of hot air coming from 
the back of a working fridge. Sometimes it feels like the waft of air 
coming from a kilowatt electric heater, but if you check the power 
rating of the fridge, you'll see it is much less. Not very scientific, I 
know, but you get the idea.

&gt;   That looks &quot;cool&quot;, but I'm confused. How do you get 1250w of cooling
&gt;  with a 300w draw? And how can it draw 300w at both 12v and 24v?
