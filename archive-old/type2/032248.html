Subject: Oil pump replacement: how important?
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.SOL.4.02A.9905202321240.1267-100000_at_insci14.ucsd_dot_edu&gt;

I have been slowly rebuilding my '77 2L engine.  I know that the engine
had only 93K miles on it when I took it apart.  The cause of death was #3
exhaust valve seat failure, upon inspection most all major parts were out
of spec, and were thus replaced (crank, cam, rods, bearings, P&amp;C, both
heads). I have the engine almost totally reassembled and am now worrying
that I did not replace my oil pump (but yes I did pack it with assembly
lube).  How awful is my oversight, and is it so bad that I should pull it
back apart and repair my misteak?  No, I didn't even open it up and
measure anything.
