Subject: Re: [T2] deck height

Eric,

thanks for your input.  However, it seems like an incomplete response.
Keeping with the educational mission of the list it would help if you said
&quot;why&quot; or &quot;why not&quot;.  Somebody was talking about the &quot;quench&quot; area a few
weeks ago.  What is ideal?  Please share your understanding!!

thanks,
Will A.

'70 Westy &quot;Rebertha&quot; pondering CR on the 1776 rebuild as we speak
engle 100/ P&amp;P 041 heads/ dual DRLA 36/ 1.5 exhaust
feeling like 7.2:1 was too tame. . .

----- Original Message -----
&gt;&gt; If you run a higher CR with the fuel we have today, you will have
&gt;&gt; overheating problems.

&gt;No offense, but that's so far from fact that it isn't even funny. Just to
be
&gt;honest.
