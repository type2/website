Subject: Re: [T2] Westy Which color for interior Vinyl

Britt Grannis sends:

&gt; I'm in the process of removing the interior of my 72 Westy and was wondering
&gt; if anybody had changed the color of the seat fabric? I have an industrial
&gt; sewing machine ( don't know how to use it yet) and have bolts of tan, white,
&gt; light blue, dark blue, and brown vinyl. The Westy is white so I'm open to
&gt; any ideas especially if you have pictures of the finished project. One more
&gt; question, has anyone covered the wood in a Westy on the ceiling? I was
&gt; trying to be different and quiet the darn thing down a bit.

What color's the exterior?
