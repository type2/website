       I would most definetely recommend converting to an external oil cooler
&amp; filter on the T1 engine anyway. And yes to both, &amp; it probably is not good
to lose the #3 retard unless you also lose the stock cooler.

&gt; Thanks for the good explanation IRT  #3 retard.  So, does this mean I lose
&gt; the retard on #3 when/if  I convert to Petronix?   Do I keep the retard on
&gt; a points triggered
&gt; electronic?  I think the answer is yes to both.  Last question - how bad is
&gt; it for my motor
&gt; (68sp upright) to lose that retard?  The more I learn about this, the more
