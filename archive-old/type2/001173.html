&gt; I have recently purchased a a 74 automatic. It sat in a barn for a
&gt; couple of years an the carbs are all gummed up. I called the
&gt; neighborhood VW shop and they told me that they would'nt touch
&gt; them because there are bushings in the throttle body that will need to be
&gt; replaced and they cant do that there. They also said that you
&gt; cant purchase new carbsfor this model.


The dual Solexes used in '72-74 have been discontinued for years.  However,
I expect to have a few N.O.S. German sets coming from Europe in about 4-8
weeks, at somewhere around $390 for the pair.  If you need carbs sooner, you
could investigate a Weber progressive conversion, arguably not as good as
the original design but the standard workaround since the Solexes were until
now unavailable.
