Hello List,
   First I would like to give a little information about myself as I am new
to this list.  After driving an 1982 1.6l Diesel Vanagon Westy for some
years and realizing the limitations of the power of the engine and the hills
I live in(Pennsylvania) i decided to let my Van (&quot;Old Orange&quot; or &quot;Easty the
Westy&quot; depending on my mood) rest after the engine blew for the second time
until I can replace with Ken Wilfy's 1.9l Brazilian diesel engine.  THis led
me to purchasing a 1973 type 2 which i saw sitting in a farm field.  The bus
is pretty solid other than the minor things that most of you can imagine add
up after 7 years in a field.  It has been my daily driver for about the last
4 months and currently I have had a problem with the fuel pump which I could
really use some help solving.
     I have been having some problems getting the dual Solex's tweaked
properly and three days ago I noticed a gas leak under the bus.  Upon
further inspection i realized that the fuel is coming from the hose which
extends off the bottom of the fuel pump and is not connected to anything. 
Perhaps it is some kind of breather or overflow.  I do not know much about
these things but i am willing with the help of another local listee (thanks
Josh) to try to keep this bus alive forever.  I am curious to what might
cause fuel to come out of this hose.  The hose can best be described as a
woven fabric hose that can be viewed in the Haynes manual for 1972 through
1979 transporters on page 46 on the illustration. It is the hose seen
between the line indicating numbers 16 and 11 but is not numbered.  My bus
is a 1973 with stock dual SOlex carbs.If anyone can help me diagnose this
problem please either post on the list or since i am new and not so good at
finding my way around the list respond at my e-mail which is
s_rippey_at_excite_dot_com.  I think it could either mean i need to repair the fuel
pump or that the carbs may have something to do with this leak, perhaps
running to rich or lean.   Please help as I am stranded with no vehicle
until this problem is remedied.  Also I should mention that the leak is very
slow, maybe 1 drop every 20 minutes.  Thanks in advance for any help or
suggestions.

seth rippey and my 1973 type2 &quot;the Cheetah&quot;
  thus named for its original two-tone white and light yellow paint uniquely
spotted with surface rust and copiuos amounts of rust colored primer which
gives the appearence of a cheetah.
