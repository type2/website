Hi Fred,  I've never noticed water in my front parking lights, but last time
I changed the bulb I noticed a similar watermark on one side, although my
lenses aren't cracked.  Some corrosion to the reflector as well.  Must be a
common problem.  Think I'll file a little round notch in the bottom edge of
the lens.  If the notch doesn't extend out much farther than the lip of the
rubber gasket, it shouldn't let any dust in, but be enough to let the water
drain out under pressure of it's own weight.

	Examination of the inside of the lens showed a waterline just below
the top of 
	the lens.  The lens is opaque enough that the water inside wasn't
obvious from 
	outside.  The whole assembly had been functioning submerged for a
long time. 

	Mystery solved.....
