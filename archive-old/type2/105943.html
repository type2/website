From: &quot;Richard Atwell&quot; &lt;ratwell_at_mac_dot_com&gt;
&gt; Talking about the rear flaps:
&gt; I've seen two stock designs in pictures but know little about them. One is
straight from top to bottom. The other is tapered at the top. I figure the
top is the same width but the bottom is wider:

Oooookay.  I was assuming that the top edge was curved to follow the wheel
well.  Didn't realize that they'd used such a simple straight mounting
design.  Cool.

&gt; All mudflapped out...

I'll start looking for something local, now that you've set me on the right
trail.  thanks, Dude. :O)
