Trinh,

I don't know if you're using that Lincoln with
shielding gas, but if you aren't, that's the place to
spend your money. Northern Tool up in Marietta has the
conversion kit for right around $100, and Pye-Barker,
just down the street from them, will sell you a C25
gas cylinder for $115. Sounds like a load of cash, but
it will really help your welding, a lot more than that
stitch/spot timer kit. 

-John Cloonan

p.s. - Isn't it about time you showed up at a SEVWC
meeting?
