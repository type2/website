The time is coming when I will need to cut and pry the damaged metal off the
rear of the wrecked '69 to remove the motor. It is the original motor with
130k on it. Was rebuilt about 10k ago and is sporting shiny new SP heads. It
has been a faithful motor and I have no reason to believe it was damaged in
the wreck.

I plan on keeping the motor as a spare for the '67 which has a good motor(
all the oil stays inside the engine) After the '69s motor is removed what
steps should I take to ensure that it stays in fine working order?


Thanks
