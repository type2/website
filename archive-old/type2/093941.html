Subject: Re: fuse box bracket

[...]

From: &quot;Steve Laughlin&quot; &lt;slaughlin_at_rushmore_dot_com&gt;

&gt;there seems =
&gt;to be some concern that this may increase the probability of shorting =
&gt;out the electrical system.  I just wanted to secure my dangling fuse box =
&gt;but do not want to cause any harm.  Anyone have any experience with =
&gt;problems or benefit of putting there fuse box back in a bracket.

Just to confirm the danger of shorting - not long after I put my 71 on the road I was pulling out of a parking lot and the bus died, electrical system 
fritzed, smoke started billowing out from under the dash, frantic owner trying to figure out what to do -- was able to jiggle the fusebox enough to get it 
to quit smokin'.

The box had slipped out of the bracket and shorted against either the bracket or the frame of the car.  I HATE that fusebox location!!

It fried the ignition contacts on my ignition switch (as well as several wires) so I had to wire an SPST paddle on the dash to flip on the main line -- 
everything else was OK.

This is why I have quick-disconnects on the negative battery terminals of both my buses now. :-/

It's a pain to work in that space, but disconnect your battery and get to it, I'd say.
