&gt; Anyways right to the point.  My thoughts on the Dipstick:  1  Fragil
&gt; very very fragil.  Many ways you can break it by accident.  2
&gt; inconvenient to use.  why couldn't Gene Berg use a friction hook up
&gt; where the wire connects to the dipstick?  You have to undo a bolt and
&gt; put it back on each time you want to check your oil level.  3 gives
&gt; you peace of mind at a low cost.  It took me 10 min. to get the whole
&gt; thing figured out and installed.

2a. Why can't you field-modify the Gene Berg dipstick? Get a little piece of
wire--long enough to crimp two connectors onto it. Put a ring-type crimp-on
on one end and a push-on male side on the other. On the wire going to the
front of the car, put a push-on female side. Solder all the connections to
ensure lasting continuity. Use shrink tubing to insulate everything. Attach
the ring-type crimp-on to the dipstick, and use a wire tie or something like
that to attach the wire going to the front to something solid.
