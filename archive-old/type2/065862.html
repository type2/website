Subject: Brakes on 71 Westy

Hello,

Thanks everyone for the info on the brake hoses.  I ended up changing three
of them and the fourth will be done tonight.  All four though were
extremely gunked up.  I was unable to blow through any of them like the new
ones.  I also replaced much of the metal lines due to the rust and my
twisting several because of the same rust.  Hopefully this will fix the
brakes and I can finally get it inspected after the 1 1/2 years of working
on nearly every area since I bought it for $180. :)

I really appreciate all the advice.

Stephen
