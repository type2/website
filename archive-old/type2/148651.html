Subject: Poptop Wood Frame Repairs

So I've got the poptop off my 73 westy.  I was only intending to clean it
and repaint it, but I've noticed that some of the wooden frame (to which the
canvas is stapled) is rotting out, particularly in front where one of the
hinges mount.  I couldn't find anything in the archives.  Has anyone made
any repairs to the poptop wood frame?  I'm wondering how best to remove the
existing rotted wood and then attach new pieces (using the old pieces as a
pattern?)  Thanks.
