Hi Volks,
I'm cross posting this to several lists so I can gather some needed camping
ideas.
  What I want to do is go camping, not in a RV park but way out some dirt
road in the mountains where I can see some of mother natures beauty. I'm
looking for an area which doesn't impose on anyone's private property ( but
if you know of someone who wouldn't mind ) near Lake Shasta, Calif, or
southern Oregon. Katelyn (11) and I would like to take the Roadcow out and
spend some quality time together and enjoy the outdoors. I told her I'd
re-teach her how to fish and with the Westy we both can cook. We are open to
and encourage anyone to join us on this fun low stress campout. Please feel
free to send comments and suggestions. Hope to see many listees at the
Classic!
