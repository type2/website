&gt;Valve Adjustment
&gt;Adjust Points
&gt;Timing
&gt;Vacuum Advance
&gt;Oil Change
&gt;Spark Plugs
&gt;Coil
&gt;
&gt;Can you suggest anything else that I might want to
&gt;tackle??

Jeff, additionally, I'd suggest you check all fluids and lubricants:

Tranny fluid - change it to the proper fluid, which is available at NAPA
stores. It must be GL4 specification--not GL5 or GL5/4. Simply GL4. I don't
recall the brand name, but if you search recent postings, you should be
able to find it...or I can p-mail you this evening if you don't have any
luck. Most people don't realize that they ought to have this older-spec
tranny fluid, so they put the newer stuff in. The newer stuff is bad for
the metals used in older VW trannys, so you should change it on the
assumption that it has bad stuff in it.

CV joints -- I don't know the history of your bus, but if these are dry,
you can burn up good CV joints in short order. You should check your CV
boots to be certain they are in good condition. If they're not, replace
them and add new CV grease. My flaps sells a suitable grease in a big tube
for a few dollars. You can also spend $10 or so on kits for each boot. I
usually do mine for under $20. It's a 1/2 day job, including time to clean
and marvel at your CVs...longer if you don't like to get greasy. :) (that's
really a joke. you WILL get greasy swapping CV boots!) IFF your boots are
in good condition, you may be able to inject grease into them by way of a
thick hypodermic-type injection system. I've not done this, but if you
search the archives at www.type2_dot_com, you will prolly find info on the
technique. 

I wouldn't suggest taking your CVs apart until you know what you're doing.
You have to be careful NOT to take them apart when you remove them, but if
you do, you have to make sure the balls go back in the same locations. Muir
has a good explanation of this. For now, just try to make sure you have
grease in your CV joints. You can just clean off the boots, loosen them,
and then pull them back for this. You'll want to go buy a 6mm head for your
3/8 drive rachet, though. This will make the experience much more bearable.
Be sure to thoroughly clean out inside the allen-headed bolts before you
put the wrench in there, or you'll strip them trying to take them out. That
will cost you hours and much aggrevation. I use a pick to pick the crap out
of the allen bolts.

Brake fluid -- in addition to Alex's suggestion on bleeding, I'll add...be
sure your fluid is correct and brakes are properly adjusted. You also may
want to trace the line on your brake booster to assure it doesn't have any
leaks. A leaky brake booster line will cause your engine to run rough and
not idle, as it will inject more air than you need; over time I think it
can burn valves. Crawl under the bus at the driver's seat and look up.
That's your brake booster. Follow the line to the back. If you need new
line, take a small piece to an industrial supply house that sells heavy,
reinforced hose (the kind they use to make hydraulic lines for heavy
equipment); they don't always have it, so I wouldn't suggest randomly
cutting your line, even if it DOES have leaks. You may find yourself
patching it for the time being. I think the inside diameter is 1/2&quot;, but be
sure. Buy the stuff from them. Figure on spending $30+ to replace the hose.
If you can't find it locally, I posted several months back on a place here
in Memphis that has it and will ship reasonably...and takes plastic. Either
search the archives or p-mail me and I'll dig it up again. If you find your
brake booster hose is leaky, you can plug the line and run without the
booster...you just won't be able to stop as quickly.

When you set your timing, be sure to only START with static timing. You
really don't even have to static time your bus if it's already running.
First set the dwell; then set timing based on high RPMs...like 3000, I
think--use the timing light and tachometer. You should be more interested
in total advance than with advance at idle. Your bus will not be running
down the road at idle. There are good articles in the library www.type2_dot_com
on properly timing your engine. These should be read in addition to Muir,
as they will provide some additional insight. Keep your old points as
emergency spares.

Be careful reinstalling your plugs. If you cross-thread them, you will
probably end up pulling your engine to repair the problem. Remember that VW
heads are made of soft metal and easily cross-threaded. Use anti-seize on
the plugs when you reinstall them to prevent future problems. When you pull
your plugs, keep track of which cylinder each comes from and take the time
to &quot;read&quot; the plugs. The different colors indicate different burn patterns
and engine conditions. I'm not familiar enough to give you a rundown, but
I've found some pretty pictures in every chilton's I've picked up. It's not
worth buying one, but your library probably has it anyway. When you pull
your plugs, you may find that they already have inserts (sleeves) on them.
If this is the case and they come out, you have some philosophical
decisions to make--whether to reinstall the inserts, put in new ones, or
pull the engine and have the heads &quot;properly&quot; repaired. I'll refer you to
the archives for ad-nauseum discussions on these issues.

If you have access to a compression tester, you might do a compression test
to take a reading on the condition of your cylinders/valves. If compression
is even and about 100 or more all around, that's a good sign. If it varies
much, that's not good.

Before you do your tune-up, make sure your vacuum hoses (including the
brake booster line) don't leak. Also, check the boots that connect your
carb riser to the intake manifold (they are the 2 black or red rubber parts
below and to either side of the carb). If these leak air, you'll be
compensating for that when you do your timing and it'll be off. I think
this can (over time) burn valves, but I'm not positive about this.

Oh, and I almost forgot the most important thing of all. Check your fuel
lines! More buses burn because of old fuel lines than for any other reason.
Check the archives for more details, but you'll definitely want to
disconnect your battery and then check the fuel line coming out of your gas
tank and running under your bus to your fuel pump. Be careful or you might
get soaked with gas. Anyway, that line comes down right over the starter
and is often overlooked. If you wind up replacing fuel lines, be sure to
use the correct size, which is measured in millimeters, not inches (I think
it's 7mm, but I could be wrong). I use clamps on my fuel lines, but there
are two schools of thought there. The best info is in a post from Bob
Hoover (from several years back), which discusses peening fuel fittings.
Search the archives on &quot;fuel&quot; and &quot;peen*&quot; and let me know if you come up
dry. Make sure your filter is BEFORE the fuel pump and clean/new. DO NOT
PUT A FUEL FILTER BETWEEN THE FUEL PUMP AND CARB! If you do that and it
clogs, it can blow out a fuel line and spew gas all over your engine. Put 2
on before the fuel pump if you want.

I could probably go on, but I think this is the main stuff I'd suggest.

Good luck on your maiden voyage. Remember to keep the right amount of oil
in her and don't let her get too hot. (If you can hold the dipstick in your
hand for a few seconds, she's okay.) Carry some basic tools and basic books
and don't be afraid to fix what breaks where it breaks. Most damage seems
to occur when people keep pushing their bus instead of pulling over and
fixing the problem...like the guy who called me at 4:41 this morning to
find out what shop to take his bus to. It had started smoking--new to
buses, didn't know to check the dipstick for heat. If he had waited until
6:30 to call, I would have tried to help him figure out the problem. As it
was, I could only direct him to the best $hop I know of in Memphi$. At 4:41
a.m., he was lucky to get that out of me.

Take care! Joe
