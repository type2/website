Hey everybody. Been thinking about going with Compu-Fire &quot;pointless&quot;
ignition. (I will keep the points, etc in the tool box just in case.) I
have a 1600 DP with an 009, and a Bosch Blue Coil. Questions:
1) Anybody want to venture pro's or con's about Compu-Fire?
2) Will the Blue Coil be sufficent?
3) If anyone who is reading this has done this, ant tips, tricks?
TIA
Mark
