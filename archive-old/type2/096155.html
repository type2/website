&gt; the engine is hot!!  Wait until its cold, so you wont strip the hole!!

yeah never do that if you can help it

&gt; if you want a temporay solution, and no helicoil, you could use some Loct=
ite
&gt; or better in my advice, get some JB WELD, put it around your spark plug  =
and
&gt; screw in...wait until its all dry (24 hour)!!

will JB Weld work on something that hot??? I do have some and have used it
on my gas heater with good results.  don't care if the plug never comes
out at this point this head is trash anyway will use a different head for
the core even

Thanks
Bob
