Subject: [T2] CAT vs EGR (or both?)

Oh gee, something I know about!   Ok, the VECI
(pronounced veh-kee) label says it all.  The VECI
label is a legally required placard, behind the
drivers door or drivers door pillar, which describes
the date of manufacture, and the Emissions Control
Equipment installed at time of Manufacture.  Even here
in Oregon, the VECI label is king to DEQ.  If the VECI
label says &quot;No Cat&quot; then the DEQ (or whatever the
state air polution authority is named) testers know
&quot;No Catalytic Converter.&quot;  EGR, AIR (Air Injection
Reactor) pump, and other devices are listed on the
VECI label.
   
In Oregon, if your engine equipment does not match the
VECI label, you flunk.  Period.   I don't know about
California and other states, but here in Oregon, your
vehicle equipment has to match the VECI label.   So
you need to be careful in engine rebuilds and such. 
Even my 1978 T2 has to match its VECI label.  
    
The VECI label &quot;Hardware&quot; requirements are in addition
to the exhaust tested vehicle HC (Hydrocarbon) and CO
(Carbon Monoxide) emissions levels at various speeds. 
Lastly, the VECI label hardware needs to be connected
and operational.  Visible emmissions equipment
tampering is grounds for DEQ failure as well.

&gt; &gt;Is there anyone out there passing CA smog without
&gt; the EGR stuff in place?
