Subject: 15&quot; wheels for a '68

So, I guess I should clarify that question.  Does anyone have extra 15&quot; 
wheels to fit a '68? Yes, I know it'll ruin the speedo accuracy, but all new 
guages are going into the bus anyway, so that won't matter. I found a place 
I could order from, but thought I'd check with the list in case one of you 
would like to unload a set.  Then again, if I had a set, they'd be on my bus 
and I'd be trying to unload the 14&quot;. :) Thanks again.

-Em
