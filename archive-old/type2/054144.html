&gt; sounds good to me, except you should have argon/co2 gas for mig  on steel.
&gt; straight argon is for aluminum, a pipe dream for beginners...

I'll have to get some argon/CO2; I've been welding with pure argon and it
works okay but it will have to be cheaper (better is a bonus here) with
Ar/CO2 in the tank.
