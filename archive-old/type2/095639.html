Subject: RE: [T2]  Dual battery Relay (Long)

I have to admit not having seen the earlier part of this thread (I could
perhaps have saved some trouble if I had) but I'll see if I can clarify
here...

The purpose of a relay setup such as this is to &quot;isolate&quot; the camping and
starting batteries when the key is off.  So when the bus is running, both
batteries are connected in parallel and charging, but when the bus is off,
the two are separated, such that even if the aux battery dies it will not
drain the starting battery and leave you stranded. This is precisely the
same design that Westfalia used on campers that were equipped with dual
batteries. It is a simple design yet effective. Also, unlike an isolator
setup (which, when its diode fails, will tend to allow the starting battery
to drain), if this setup fails it may cause your aux items not to run but
it's unlikely to leave you unable to start your bus.

&gt; SO, any electrical component that I want to run off of the aux
&gt; battery (int. lights, radio, etc) will have to be wired directly to the
aux
&gt; battery, since when the vehicle is running, both batteries are connected
together in
&gt; parallel and being charged by the alternator but when the
&gt; ignition switch is off, the contacts are open, completely disconnecting
the second
&gt; battery from the vehicle electrical system.

Precisely. However, you should make sure to run anything hooked up to the
aux battery through a fuse or fuse block (not &quot;directly&quot; to the battery).

&gt; However, the directions for the relay clearly suggest that no consumers
&gt; should be connected to the aux. battery during charging...
&gt; which means that if the radio and int. lights are connected to the aux
&gt; battery, I shouldn't use them when the ignition is on...

Hella is being a little overcautious here.  To understand what is happening
here, you need to recognize that by design this kit (that is, both the relay
and the included wiring) essentially &quot;trickle charges&quot; the aux battery while
you are driving. It does not &quot;jolt&quot; the aux battery with a supercharge as
soon as you restart your bus.  This is done for safety reasons.  An
electrical engineer from Exide Battery was nice enough to explain the
reasoning for this on the Vanagon list some time ago.  Michael Benthin
reposted it here back in January. For those who are interested, I have
copied it below. It is a very good explanation on how this relay system
works, and why it is _intentionally_ designed to provide a &quot;trickle charge&quot;
to the aux battery, rather than jolting it with full current like a simple
switch (or a larger relay/heavier wiring) would do.

So how does this work?  Let's say you run your aux battery almost completely
dead when camping.  When you start your bus, the relay will close and allow
your starting battery to start your bus. Then it will remain closed,
allowing an intentionally-limited amount of current to pass to the aux
battery, for the purpose of both recharging your aux battery _and_ powering
those items that are wired directly to it.  So if you are not running any
accessories that are hooked up to the aux battery, that full amount will be
used for recharging your aux battery, so it will be recharged in the
shortest possible time.  This is what Hella is recommending.  If, on the
other hand, you use those accessories (i.e. stereo, interior lights, or
whatever you have wired right to the aux battery) while you are driving, the
rate at which the aux battery recharges will be decreased by the rate of
draw of the items that you are using.  As long as what you are using is
_lower_ in total draw than the available current, the aux battery will still
recharge (but at a slower rate).  Only in a situation where the draw of aux
items that you are trying to run _exceeds_ the available current, will you
run into trouble. In that case, the aux battery will not recharge at all,
and those items may not work properly at first (until you let the aux
battery recharge a bit).

What does this mean to you?  It means that if you kill your aux battery, it
will take a bit of driving for it to fully recharge again.  So the solutions
are, either don't completely deplete your aux battery, or if you do, don't
expect it to fully recharge half an hour after you leave the campsite. If
you are a typical user, who uses the aux battery to run a typical stereo at
moderate volume, interior lights, etc. while camped, and then drives a
couple of hours before camping again, you will probably never have a
problem.  A few days of camping, then a bit of driving, is fine, and just
what this relay is good for. On the other hand, there are two scenarios
where a setup that is designed for a faster charge rate is called for.  One
is if you have a monster stereo hooked up to your bus that draws a ton of
current quickly (or something similar that has an incredible current draw).
If so, you may find that you will have to minimize using it when you first
start your bus up again, as it may draw so much current that it keeps the
aux battery from fully recharging.  As long as you go easy on it for a while
when you leave camp, you'll be fine. But if not, you may exceed the relay's
ability to allow the aux battery to recharge.  The other scenario is if you
will use the aux battery long enough to run it down, and then need to use it
again with minimal driving time in between. In that case, the relatively
slow charge rate of this design may be insufficient to allow full recharging
before you camp again.  But both of these scenarios are less than common.
For the average person, the basic relay setup like this is all you need,
which is why Westfalia used the same design themselves.

&gt; This relay will allow my secondary battery to be charged when the bus
&gt; is running, but if the main battery is drained completely dead, the
&gt; secondary is useless because there needs to be power going
&gt; through the relay in order for it to switch over to the secondary... and
that power
&gt; comes from the main battery...

But that's the point. The whole purpose of the relay is to _keep_ the main
battery from going dead, so that this never happens. This is why you want to
run your aux items directly to the aux battery (via a fuse), not the main
battery, so it is the aux battery that drains when you camp rather than the
main battery.  If the aux items kill your aux battery, then thanks to the
relay your bus will still start, because the main battery is still charged,
which is the whole point.  If your main battery is dead, then this means
that you have some other problem, such as a bad main battery or a bad
alternator, in which case the fact that your camping items won't run is the
_least_ of your problems.

&gt; I think the best way to go here would actually be to leave wiring
&gt; as it is,  with all of the consumers connected to the main battery, leave
&gt; the relay in as I have it installed, and install a manual marine switch
&gt; to switch back and forth between batteries, so that when camping
&gt;  I can use the aux battery, when driving I can use the main battery
&gt;  and still charge the aux. battery.  Detailed info and diagrams are shown
here:
&gt; http://members.bellatlantic_dot_net/~vze3t2qs/bus/relay.htm

I think that this would defeat the purpose of the relay.  The whole idea is
to hook the consumers up to the camping battery (and optimally use a deep
cycle marine battery for this purpose that is designed for this type of
use).

Below is Beckett Cantrell's  tome on the issue. Hopefully between it and the
above, this clarifies some issues. This is not to say that a relay setup
like the Hella kit is the only way to hook up dual batteries in a bus. But
it does explain how the relay configuration works, and why.

&gt; From:	Beckett Cantrell &lt;THX0980_at_aol_dot_com&gt;
&gt; Subject:	Becketts Tome on Dual Batt.s, Relays, Saftey, and charging
&gt;
&gt; Right then. Let us start with the safety issue. In theory, the safest
&gt; way to charge an automotive or marine or aircraft batt.(24v in the case
&gt; of the latter) or any wet cell storage device( and for those of you
&gt; running gel or AGM batt.'s, hold on, I'll get to them in a bit...),
&gt; whilst said batt is in-situ, would be with a nice, steady, low amp
&gt; constant charge. In the real world, this just ain't how it goes down.
&gt; Given the nature of alternators, and the various demands of an
&gt; automotive enviornment, what happens is that you get a big thumping
&gt; surge of amps,(say, right after you disengage the starter) followed
&gt; shortly there after by a much &quot;softer&quot; rate of charge. Now lets throw
&gt; our deeply discharged aux. batt. into the picture. If you've got it
&gt; wired in with a chunk of thumb sized cable, then that sucker is gonna
&gt; suck up all the amps it can get. This does two very bad things: 1) As
&gt; the aux. batt.  is drained, it is going to, for lack of a better word,
&gt; act as a shunt.( picture jump starting a car with a dead batt. If you
&gt; connect a good batt.  directly to the terminals of the dead batt.,
&gt; chances are that the car with the dead batt. will crank over slowly. But
&gt; if you connect the good batt. to the ground of the car with the dead
&gt; batt. and the hot lead of the starter solinoid, that puppy will fire
&gt; right up.)  When you turn the key, current is not only going to try to
&gt; go to a Demand device, like the starter, but will also try to equalize
&gt; the charge between the cranker batt., and the aux. batt.  (Now remember,
&gt; folks, we're talking about using a relay here, not an isolator, which
&gt; has its own inherent problems, like voltage drop across the diodes...)
&gt; This may result in the vehicle not starting. If you do get the beastie
&gt; to start, we come to Very Bad Thing number 2) Bosch and Motorola
&gt; alternators absolutely HATE having to supply anything close to their
&gt; &quot;Rated&quot; out-put. Let's just say you've got a Bosch 65amp alt. in your
&gt; Brick. You think &quot;...65amps, well thats more than enough to handle the
&gt; demands of my system...&quot; but what you might not know is that 65amp
&gt; rating is at 100% duty cycle. Your actual usable out-put is 1/2 to 2/3
&gt; the total rated out-put. So, now you've down to 32-45amps, usable. But
&gt; wait, is it hot out? Yes? Then cut another 15-25% off of those numbers.
&gt; Now you start to sweat(pardon the pun).  What it comes down to is that
&gt; your alt., under normal conditions, has its hands full just running the
&gt; stock systems of your rig. Add in an aux. batt.  wired in with a relay
&gt; and monster cable, and that alt. will let out its &quot;smoke&quot; in no time
&gt; flat. And I do mean smoke. The fire hazzard is real. That is why using a
&gt; small relay and small ga. wire to charge the aux. batt. is much safer.
&gt; Think of it this way. If some pissy little 18ga wire under your dash
&gt; shorts out, you'll see some sparks, and think&quot;...Well, rat poop. There
&gt; goes the connection to my spiffy little motor driven dashboard
&gt; hula-girl...&quot; If a 2ga. cable shorts, you've got a very large arc welder
&gt; on the loose. Not pretty at all. To sum it up: A relay in the 15-30amp
&gt; range, wired in with 12ga connections is fine. Hella errs on the side of
&gt; caution, and who could blame them? A big 75amp relay, and 4or 2ga. cable
&gt; is simply asking for an expensive and dangerous problem.
&gt; Now lets tackle the issue of batt.'s and charging when applied to a
&gt; relay controlled dual set up, where you've got a standard automotive
&gt; type cranker batt. and an aux. deep cycle batt. To wit: Your
&gt; run-of-the-mill cranker batt.(wet cell) is very happy when it is allowed
&gt; to do one job, that being to give up large amounts of current for a
&gt; short period of time, and to be recharged with the same, ie, short
&gt; recharge period at high amps. This happens whenever you start your eng.
&gt; It then goes about the task of holding on to its charge, while the alt.
&gt; keeps the other bits going, until you need a little extra bump, like
&gt; when you turn on the headlights, or fire up that new roof rack mounted
&gt; Death Ray. Then the batt. takes another hit, the alt. sees this, gives
&gt; another short burst of high current flow, and things settle down.  The
&gt; deep cycle aux. batt(also wet cell), on the other hand, is loath to do
&gt; this. It is happy with a nice steady rate of discharge, and recharge. So
&gt; it would seem that we've got a problem, eh? Yup, we do. If the aux.
&gt; batt. is deeply discharged, and you're wired up with massive relays and
&gt; cable, it's     gonna die a quick death. And so is your cranker batt.,
&gt; and ditto for the alt.  itself. Remember, alt.'s are stupid devices. All
&gt; they do is sense demand, and keep puting out the amps till said demand
&gt; is met. So not only is the aux.  batt. getting way too much juice, so is
&gt; the cranker, and that alt. of yours is working at its limit(100% Duty
&gt; Cycle) to supply the needs of the aux.          batt. Bad, bad, bad.(
&gt; Okay, here's the part for you Optima, gel-cell and AGM folks) These
&gt; batt.s, both cranker and deep cycle, handle the above situation pretty
&gt; darned well. &quot;..Oh, good...That's what I've got, so no
&gt; problems...Right?&quot; Wrong. Your alt. is still frying itself. So now we
&gt; come to the solution. It is not a perfect one, but it is an even trade
&gt; off between component and batt. life, safety and re-charge time. Its the
&gt; use of a moderate relay and lighter gauge wiring. Pretty simple, eh?
&gt; Unfortunately, you just can't have your cake, and eat it too. If you
&gt; want to help out the situation, get a regulated 120vAC to 12vDC power
&gt; supply, in an amp range that suits your needs, and wire it in to your
&gt; system. If your camped in an area with hook-ups, the power supply will
&gt; switch on when it senses 120vAC, and by-pass your aux. batt. If your out
&gt; in the boonies, well then, you've got to make due with what you've got.
&gt; And the small relay/small wire system is about the best compromise you
&gt; can get. Please feel free to ask any questions that y'all might still
&gt; have.
&gt;
&gt; First, I'm really surprised that among all of the list members, there is
&gt; not one single Electrical Engineer who stepped forward to explain this
&gt; relay dilemma. So I'll give it to you in a nut shell: Guess what folks,
&gt; if your aux batt. is deeply discharged, and you're running 2ga. wire and
&gt; a 75amp relay, the batt. will most likely draw 75 amps(or whatever your
&gt; alt. can put out) at initial surge. But if you're running, lets say, a
&gt; Hella relay, rated at 15amps, with the wiring provided, and with the
&gt; same deeply discharged aux.  batt., you are most likely gonna draw about
&gt; 12amps at initial surge, and much lower after a short period of time.
&gt; It's all related to the Gauge of the Wire. Really. Don't buy it? Try
&gt; this: Take that same deeply discharged batt.  and run a really, really
&gt; tiny gauge wire directly from the positive post of your cranker batt.,
&gt; to the positive post of the afore mentioned discharged batt. Now start
&gt; the engine. Did the wire smoke? Have the flames reached the cockpit? Are
&gt; you searching for that fire extinguisher(that is also probably deeply
&gt; discharged!)? NOPE. Your dead batt. will draw what the wire can provide.
&gt; Still don't belive me? Okay, lets see what VW did from the factory:
&gt; On older models equipped with dual batts, the relay was rated at 15amps(
&gt; I'm holding the original one out of my ' 79 Delux in my hand as we
&gt; speak) and the wire from said relay to the aux batt is 12ga. Believe me
&gt; folks, nothing can suck down a batt like the old style Dometic 12v/120v
&gt; fridges found in the pre-Vanagon Type 2's, and even when these batts are
&gt; totally discharged, starting your eng. does not cause a pyrotechnic
&gt; display. If it did, VW would have been litigated out of existence by
&gt; now. If that still doesn't convince you, well just flip through the
&gt; pages of  Brightons Studies in Electron Flow ( My God, how I loathed
&gt; that damn book when I was in college...) to get a clearer picture. Your
&gt; dead batt will only suck up as much as much juice as a given wire will
&gt; flow. The batt. is not an active device, like an electric motor, but a
&gt; passive one, and will not suck your cranking batt dry at start-up
&gt; (Unless you are running Massive gauge wire to the aux. batt. That is
&gt; exactly why VW went with smaller relays and wire gauge.) Think of the
&gt; set-up as a &quot;trickle charger&quot;. Okay, enough already.
&gt;
&gt; It would appear that some more clarification is in order. The Hella kit
&gt; will Charge the aux. batt. _at_ aprox. 15amps. That is charge Only. The
&gt; accessories you run off of the aux. batt have Nothing What-So-Ever to do
&gt; with the Hella kit, and everything to do with the batt.'s rating. If
&gt; your aux. batt. is rated at, lets just say, 150amp/hrs, then you can
&gt; expect to get just that, ie, you could run an accessory that draws 1 amp
&gt; for 150hrs, or an accessory that draws 10amps for 15hrs, or any given
&gt; combination up to the max capacity of said batt. The Hella kit has
&gt; nothing to do with the out-put of the batt, just its charge rate!
&gt; Exactly where am I losing everybody with this? Just because the Hella is
&gt; rated at 15amps, does not mean that you can't run your stereo, inverter,
&gt; coffee pot, lighting, fans,etc. at the same time. The only thing you
&gt; need worry about is exceeding the rated capacity of your aux. batt.
&gt;  Just run a 10ga. wire from
&gt; your aux. batt. to a separate fuse box and add accessories to your
&gt; hearts
&gt; content. Again: THE HELLA KIT ONLY AFFECTS RATE OF CHARGE!!!!!!
&gt; NOTTOTAL  USABLE AMPS!!!! That is determined by the rating of the aux.
&gt; batt.
&gt; Hoping this clears it up,
&gt; Beckett
