Subject: Re: [T2] Rear Window Defogger Grid

I've been trying to solve this problem for years. I get proper voltage at
the terminals and busbars at the ends of the window when the switch is on,
but no current flows (checked w/ ammeter in series w/ grid).  I measure an
open circuit from busbar to busbar with the power off.  I probed the
gridlines with a voltmeter to try to find the breaks (meter leads on each
side of a break would show nearly full voltage - meter leads across good
grid line would show minimal voltage), but, I must have multiple breaks in
every gridline.

Let me know how well this works for you.

Barry,

I did this when I had my rear window out and redid *all* of the
lines.  Seem to work very well although I just got the bus back
yesterday from the painters and have never had a chance to test it.

Resistance seems about right though.

I think the product was made by  frost fighterout of houston.

Took 2 $20.000 kits.
