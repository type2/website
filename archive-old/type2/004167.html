Subject: exhaust leak?

I have exhaust leaks where my exhaust manifolds meet the little curved c
shaped pipe before it goes into the heat exchanger. The nuts and bolts are
too far gone for me to install new gaskets. Is there some type of compound I
can fill the cracks with? I tried JB weld and that epoxy stuff but it just
gets too hot and crumbles and falls out. Any Ideas?
Thanks!
Eric..from Wisconsin
