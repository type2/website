Subject: Re: [T2] Where to mount the fuel pump. Picture please?

Thanks Karl and Bob,

I was alittle mixed up when I wrote the question.
Being up side down and backwards while working on my
bus confused me when I was thinking about it. I just
went out and looked at it and I did hook it up  the
way you said. Sorry for the blonde moment.

Thanks for the correction!

Have a great day!

Regards,
David Kelly

&gt; The beginning of the fuel rail is on the drivers

&gt; Your other question was the fuel tank outlets. 
&gt; The one pointing straight back is the return.
&gt; The outlet to the pump should be pointing to the
&gt; drivers side.
