Subject: catalytic heaters

With all the talk of heating busses recently, I was wondering if anyone had 
first hand opinions of Catalytic Heaters?  MrSolar_dot_com sells a 'Platinum Cat'
catalytic heater that I saw someone else had in their bus for only $300!

At only 14x12x5.5 inches.. would there be any technical difficulties (ignoring
fuel/exhaust line routing for now) installing one of these in the roof
of the pop top? Specifically where the rear dome light is now.  I can easily
imagine one of these units, flanked by a pair of low wattage flourescents, 
being powered by an aux battery...  I wish they gave the weight of this unit.
If weight/space restrictions did not matter, is it possible to install/utilize
'flexible' liquid propane fuel lines, that would handle being raised and
lowered with the pop top?  If that was not an option, how about the rear 
ceiling, above the engine compartment.  (in the cabin though, not in the 
engine compartment, above the rear deck)  I've seen a riviera with a rather
low hanging shelf there, how much room do you have under that roofing
material before you start interfering with the pop tops floor?

Thanks
