Make sure everything is on the up-and-up as far as the boxes contacting
anything else restricting them from mating to the head.  I had to drill the
flamges of my 75 boxes to go on my 74 heads. i have no idea why, but they just
wouldn't go.

Put the exchangers on independent of the rest of the exhaust system.

They can be a bit of a bear.  I had to get my 250lb friend to help convince my
boxes they should be reinstalled.

Left is your left if you are looking at the back of the bus (this is late bus
with type4, right?)

good luck,

clark

&gt;   I am in the process of putting the heat exchangers back on and I must say

&gt; they are very stubborn and it almost appears I have a bent exhaust stud it
is 
&gt; so difficult to get on. However I dont have a bent stud and my next option
it 
&gt; seems like is hammer and punch to drivem on but I can see ruining my threads

&gt; and I think that would be a huge mistake. Is there a trick to this?
&gt;  Also as this is my first bus and rebuild, here I am this far  along and I m

&gt; not sure which side of the motor is left and right. they say put the left 
&gt; one(heat exchanger) on first, I assume the fan side is the front and the
left 
&gt; fan side is the left front side of the motor, duh???
&gt; 
&gt;   Thankyou,
&gt;
