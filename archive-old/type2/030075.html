Eric,

Front end alignments on bay window buses are a bit tricky and getting a
shop to do it correctly is a PITA :-( The problem is that one of the tie
rods and the drag link are adjustable and the other tie rod is of fixed
length. I don't have my bentley here at work, but I am 90% sure the left
(driver's side) tie rod is fixed, the right (passenger's side) tie rod is
adjustable.

The procedure (assuming I have the tie rods correct as to side (HAH! :-))
is to 

set the toe of the right front wheel by hand, 
set the toe of the left front wheel by adjusting the length of the tie rod
  on that side, 
pop the drag link out of the pitman arm (comes off the steering box),
center the steering box,
level the steering wheel,
adjust the length of the drag link, and finally 
reconnct the drag link to the pitman arm.

Once you have the toe set, you are ready to set the camber :-)

Look at your ball joints.  One of them will have a huge hex under it.  Pop
that ball joint loose from its trailing arm.  *If* the cam comes with the
ball joint (it usually does), then rotate that with a basin wrench until
your caster is correct.  re-tighten the ball joint. Do the same on the
other side.  If the cam sticks in the trailing arm, you need to pop it out
with a big socket and mallet.  

Scott Fraser gave thes specs for a 1971 in a post back a bit:

&gt;From page 2-35 of the Bentley book

Wheelbase: 2400mm (94.5in)
Turning circle: 12.3m (40 ft 4in)
Track at front: 1395 mm (54 59/64&quot;)
Total toe with wheels not pressed: +15' +- 15' or 0.0 to 3.3mm (0 to 1/8
in)
Total toe with wheels pressed: +5' +- 15'
Pressure applied to wheels: 15 +- 3 kg (33 +- 6lb)
Maximum permissible difference between tow with wheels pressed and not
pressed: 25'
Front wheel camber in straight-ahead position: +40' +- 20'
   Maximum permissible difference between sides: 30'
Toe-out at a 20 degree lock to left and right (wheels not pressed): -2
degrees 20' +- 30'
Offset between stub axles: max 0.80mm (1/32 in)
Caster angle of a wheel: 3 degrees +- 40'
   equals the camber difference of a wheel on a 20 degree lock to left
and right: 2 degrees +- 25'

Final thought:  You really cannot do this correctly without the alignment
machine!  If you have one of those available to you, have at it!  There is
nothing too hard.  You need a basic wrench set, a basin wrench, a good
puller to pop the ball joint and drag link off, and a couple cotter pins
to hold them together when you put them back on.  BUT... you need that
machine!!! It's like trying to set your CO without a meter.
