Subject: Re: [T2] T2 -75 spare tire holder removal

I have one of the tire mounts you are describing. The bottom is bolted to the
top of the mumber, 2 holes drilled in it. The top is mounted to the nose with
2 nuts. There is a flat piece of metal with 2 studs on it that is behind the
nose. The studs pass thru 2 holes drilled in the nose. Nice mount, the tire
stays away from the nose and [if I remember right] the spare is facing out so
you can put a hubcap on it.

&gt; &gt; Hello.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am not familiar with the wheel mount you are describing.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have a custom made wheel mount that does connect to the front bumper,
but
&gt; &gt; most front wheel mounts are screwed into the metal skin with six (or more)
&gt; &gt; metal screws.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; Nope just two in the metal skin of the front, right under the vent air
intake
&gt; grille, and two to the bumper.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; On your problem . . .
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1)  could you get some sort of vice grip onto the spining nut??  If you
can
&gt; &gt; get a grip on it, then you might be able to remove the bolt/screw from the
&gt; &gt; front.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; Well yeah I could but I guess I have to remove the dashboard and everything.
:-)
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I had the same condition; a loose nut just under the fresh air vent.  I 'J
B
&gt; &gt; Weld' the nut to the skin on the inside.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; What's JB Weld?
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Actually, I 'J B Welded' the nut to a large fender washer while it was on
my
&gt; &gt; work bench.  The next day, when it was cured, I 'J B Welded' the  washer
&gt; &gt; with attached nut to the skin.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I was very careful NOT to get any of the 'J B Weld' in the threads of the
&gt; &gt; nut or the threads of the bolt.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for the tips Barry, gotta get back working now...
