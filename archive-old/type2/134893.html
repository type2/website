Subject: Spare Tire Cover

Does anyone know of an inexpensive tire cover for the spare when it's on the
front of the bus?  I tried Wally Mart, but they don't carry them.

Speaking of which, I now have a spare tire cover from the back of the bus.
It's worn.  The holes where the twist lock fasteners go have the grommet in
place, but one has a cracked plastic edge along the thin side and the
other's same edge has broken off (I've got the loose piece).  I've bagged up
the rubber spacers, the twist fasteners (one's broken) and will include them
with the cover.

Any idea what one's worth nowadays?  Will trade for a glove compartment
liner.
