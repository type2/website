Subject: Re: [T2] Hard to find 1st and 2nd.

I had the same problem when I got my bus.  I actually got it becasue of that problem. (The PO's wife got stuck on Mercer in downtown seattle, any of you from here knows what that is like at 5pm!)

All I found was a bent shift coupler at the tranny. replaced it and no problems since.  Took about 1/2 hour to replace.

 

&gt;It has always been a special treat to find first and second gears on this bus
and have never let anyone else drive her because of that. 

&gt;The last time I had the shifter out, I swore I would never try it again. The
welded pin in front of the part that goes to the transmission seems to be bent
slightly downward.



Anyone want to give a short course on fixing this problem?
