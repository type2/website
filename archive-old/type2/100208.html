Richard,

After a rough time at my last SMOG test (77 T2),I inquired around the local 
VW community for a &quot;VW tolerant&quot; SMOG shop. It worked.
Although I was fully compliant the second test I did not see the fuel 
restricter, fuel cap, and EGR checked or tested.

BTW running a bit rich (CO &gt; 2%)is much safer than a bit lean (CO&lt;1%).

Their attitude was that it could mean anything and not to worry
&gt;about it being listed there despite the fact it was incorrect.
&gt;
&gt;Because of fraud and the computer system control over printing, getting a
&gt;corrected sticker is way too much hassle for them but you are left trying 
&gt;to
&gt;explain this to the local smog shop 2 years from now when the tech is
&gt;looking for your thermostatic air cleaner.
&gt;
&gt;I hate these kind of mistakes and it probably means an unnecessary trip to
&gt;the referee in future unless luck and sense prevails.
