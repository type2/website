Subject: RE: [T2] This list

From the perspective of a 22 year old this list is not about being right or
wrong but about the correct answer. Then, if the correct answer doesn't suit
the situation, suitable temporary alternatives are offered. Unlike on other
lists where people speak extemporaneously this list offers real, thoughtful
advice. The ideas are not out of the latest magazine with girls slapped on the
cover but from actual experience. I like this list for that.
BUS CONTENT: My case is headed out to the machine shop to be align-bored and
to have the end thrust cut. The crank will be polished, is that necessary? The
shop recommends I buy a set of refurbished rods for $50 rather than do the
work on my rods such as sizing, aligning, and putting one bushing in. Seems a
little crazy to me. My heads are being done at another place for a total of
$60. Does anything seem out of the ordinary or is a ok?

Thanks all,

Max

I think it's more like this: as much as we like our buses, it's not a
status thing. How could it be?
