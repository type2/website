Message-Id: &lt;200205091425.AA21501_at_login002.unx.sas_dot_com&gt;

slightly off-topic.

next Friday (17th) i am heading to southern Utah with a friend of mine from
So Cal.  i will be in the area approx. one week and plan on visiting the
the following areas:
1) Zion
2) Bryce Canyon
3) Capitol Reef

unfortunately i will not be in my bus, but i was wondering if there were any
listees in this area?  might need a driveway to camp in or something.

any decent 'mom &amp; pop' type campgrounds in the area with showers &amp; possibly
a laundromat?

TIA,

Hi Joel,
I don't know of any bus clubs in the area since I live in Cali now but I 
am from So. Utah and thought I would chime in on the campgrounds. There 
is a small campground (mom and pop type) in LaVerkin which is at the 
base of the hill you have to climb to get to Zion. (off highway 9) It's 
about 20 minutes from Zion. They have a shower and a laundromat there. 
Once you get into Springdale there are laundry facilities there and the 
campgrounds in Zion are great. My favorite is Watchman (but no shower), 
here's some info:


    Watchman Campground

MAKE RESERVATIONS
ONLINE &lt;http://reservations.nps_dot_gov&gt; -or- by Phone at 1-800-365-CAMP

Open All Year
Tent: $14.00 night ($7.00 w/G. Age - Access) Elec.: $16.00 night ($8.00 
w/G. Age - Access) Group: $3.00 per/person, per/night no showers


There are also great off the highway, locals only spots. Wish I was 
there to point you to those. Lower Sunset is a great camping place but 
you have to know how to get to Delmers Pond first LOL. I am getting 
homesick.

Make sure you check out Grafton Ghost Town, it's fun to explore the old 
buildings. Ask a local how to get there. When you get into the park you 
will have to ride a tram since they closed the park to Motor Vehicles 
this year. If the driver of the tram is really cute and her name is 
Harleigh that's my good friend and you can you tell her Sher sent us and 
she will hook you up with all the info on the local stuff, especially 
the best hiking and mountain biking.

If you need any more info about St. George, Hurricane or Laverkin let me 
know. I lived there until about four years ago.  So I hope all my info 
is still accurate.

Have fun, I'm jealous. Maybe me and Buster need to plan a trip after 
Buster is up and running again.
