&gt; Sort-of Bus content:  I believe that Volkswagen still holds the patent
&gt; to the rotary engine, having acquired it when they bought the German car
&gt; company NSU many years ago (who I think was the first to go to market
&gt; with a rotary-engined production car back in the 60's).

when I lived in Germany in the late 60's the NSU's were in the midst of
the seal failures and if two drivers of NSU's were approaching they would
hold their hand out the window with a number of fingers upraised,
indicating how many engines they had in the car, at VW's expense
