JC Whitney blower can be purchased by itself. We put one in the middle as
called for in the instructions. It really helped until about Mid January to
March. It also helped the window defrosters. I plan to put Two on the current
bus, one in the middle, one in the front tube. Make sure everything is sealed
so the heat actually gets to you not the highway.  Factory gas heater is nice,
depends on where you live as to how much you really need it. I sometimes just
use it to take the chill off, then turn it off. I'd rather have it and not
need it, than need it and not have it. PS&gt; sold bus#2, I think it got a loving
