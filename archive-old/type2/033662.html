&gt; Phhftt!  You should see the porsche lists!  The 911
&gt; list has more members
&gt; than the vanagon, split and loaf lists combined!   

I suppose those guys have always been able to afford
computers. You would be surprised at how many members
there are over at the 2CV list and those guys are only
running on two cylinders!
