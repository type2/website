I would worry that the teflon tape may insulate the sender from the block
and make it function poorly, the bus boys inspection plates aren't
threaded they are just a new inspection plate with a hole you have to use 
a nut on one side and a copper washer, which doens't do alot of good. i
have been
on the hunt for one of the porsche sump plates but porsche parts are SO
expensive!

&gt; I have a plate from a porche that has the correct hole too and it was a
&gt; source of leaking as well, until I used teflon tape (plumbing tape) and used
&gt; that - now all is well for at least a couple of oil changes
