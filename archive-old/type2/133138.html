Subject: Re: [T2] really really need a/c belt part #

Karl,

Thanks a bunch, but the local dealer doesn't have it in his computer.

The ZVW number is one made up by VPC when we made things to go into the VW 
parts system.

The belt I had was a &quot;Gates&quot; replacement belt and had a Gates part number 
on it...which would also give me the length and width specs.

For the rest of ya'll, this number is molded into the belt somewhere on 
the outside of the belt...with a flashlight on an original belt in the 
bus, it could be read by rotating the engine slowly and looking at the 
belt as it came around the compressor groove.

I really can't believe that I can't find the original...I save 
*everything*&lt;sigh&gt;.

Cheers, dave
