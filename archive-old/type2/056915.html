Subject: Emission woes

Well gang my '75 Westy with the rebuilt MSHP Stage 2 rebuild failed to pass
emission testing for Illinois.  In fact on this second try the readings
got worse.  My Hc levels went from 1017ppm to 1525ppm.  I need to be down
under 700ppm for Hc.  The engine runs great though and the plugs seem to
be burning just right.

Heres my question, 
	Does a high Hc reading mean to rich or to lean or am I not even in
the right ball park?

I had a great article from the LIMBO newsletter explaining the whole
emission mystery but have misplace the article.  Any and all advice is
greatly apprecieated.  Thanks in advance.
