Subject: [T2] Discount test and tuneup equipment/gauges

I've mentioned this source before, but it's been quite a while.

This is a link to ACTRON Mfg.'s website [they sell stuff under several
names, including Sears].

Once there, follow the &quot;Garage Sale&quot; link, then all the links internal to
that page, to see what's currently available.  Some of the discounts are
quite dramatic.

The digital multimeter temperature adapter [CP7861] is interesting, and
could have several applications on air-cooled VWs.
