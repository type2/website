&gt; Eric, you wrote: &quot;...it would be fairly easy to put in a system which diluted the 
&gt; exhaust with ambient air or diverted the vehicle exhaust in some insidious way.&quot;  Such 
&gt; a system exists.  Its called a smog pump and was installed on 1973 and later VWs and 
&gt; in other cars starting in the sixties.  Its only job is to take ambient air and mixes 
&gt; it in the exhaust so the amount of exhaust gasses appears to be reduced.  The numbers 
                                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                    EXCUSE ME JUST A COTTON PICKIN' SECOND!!!!
AS far as I learned in my smog tech class, the purpose of a smog pump is 
to deliver extra oxygen to the exhaust track so that when you have excess 
fuel, or high CO content exhaust mixed with HC, the extra oxygen combines 
with the extra CO from the motor exhaust to make CO2 and combines with the 
HCs to make H20 and CO2. The smog pump is not merely to there to dilute, 
If this were the case, the gas analyzer would still pick up the same CO 
and HC becuase that is what they are tuned for. SMOG PUMPS can and DO 
work, but at the detriment of a slight loss in performance (added back 
pressure).  IF you have any doubts, there are some great books out on 
Emissions systems you could look it up in

MY 2 cents!!
