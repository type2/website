Subject: Re: [T2] Strange Sound

&gt; &gt; remove the v belt.  run the engine for a short time. if the sound is gone
&gt; &gt; then you know it was in the Alternator, fan, or fan housing.........
&gt; 
&gt; Less harmful to your engine: remove the v belt and spin the fan pulley by
&gt; hand. If you hear the noise...

When my fan hub was cracked it seemed fine when turned by hand and sounded
scary when connected. The only way I was SURE it was from the fan/gen area
was to run it with the belt off. It really wont do any harm if you do it
for a bit.
