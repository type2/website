I'm using Michlin 185-R 14&quot; Tires, sidewall also says 91T M7S which means
nothing to me. Max load 1356 LBS Per tire.
They give me 70 MPH at 2,900 RPM, 80 MPH at 3,100 RPM and the speedo is
right on as far as accuracy goes.
I've been getting them from Discount Trire Co. and they last about 35,000
Miles before they begin to separate. It's easy to tell when separation
starts, you start hearing the tires, they get louder. At this point I go
in for a free rotation and balance and the employee that's doing the
rotation reports the failing tire and I get a new set or at least two.
The fact that I camp in some very rough terrain and drive very rocky
roads to get there is what causes the separation to occur prematurely.

Discount tire warrantys a set for me every year for about $40.00 for all
four, I only purchased the one set about seven years ago. I don't believe
that I want to go to a heavier tire (more plys). They normally have to
order the tires because they aren't a popular item.

I've found the right size for me and the warranty has always provided me
with new tires at least once every 18 months. So I'm a happy camper.

I get from 17-20 MPG depending on the wind factors onthe highway. I
normally slow down when going into a headwind and let everybody pass just
like they always do anyway. I'm not going to blow a motor to get to the
lake ten minutes sooner.
