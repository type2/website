Hi Bob,

I agree with your idea of keeping it easy to grab.  In
fact the compact list I was thinking about could be
like a cell phone version of the present list.  Within
a state it would be sorted by city, and have the
essential information like name, email, phone, and
crossroads pop up fast.  I've got it for North
Carolina, but it took a couple hours to cut and paste
the AIRS info into a spreadsheet.  If someone could
figure out how to splice these &quot;cell phone lists&quot; from
each state onto the web site, maybe volunteers could
do their states and send them in.

By the way, I like spreadsheets because they seem much
simpler to me than data bases.  Being simpler, I think
they would be easier for most of us to handle and
update.  On the other hand, data base experts I'm sure
would want to do this with a data base.

Rob

&gt; don't make the list so &quot;Fancy&quot; that you can't grab
&gt; it with a simple link
&gt; such as you might have to use out on the road.
