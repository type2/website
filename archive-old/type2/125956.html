Subject: Re: [T2] 76 FI Ignition Issues

Herr Doktor,

Thanks for your help.

I have a Bentley, it's just not available at the moment. And the Haynes 
is a very poor substitute in this case. The owner of the bus also had 
an idiot's guide, But I didn't even bother opening it.


Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt;&gt; QUESTION: How do I make the tool required to get the plastic ignition 
&gt;&gt; housing apart?? I seem to remember reading a description of this 
&gt;&gt; process recently but now that I actually need the info I can't 
&gt;&gt; remember where I saw it. I did check the type2 library, but there is 
&gt;&gt; nothing there to help with the late-bay ignition housing.
&gt;
&gt; Did you say you have the Bentley?? Remove the steering wheel and upper 
&gt; switches. Remove lock bolt for housing clamp. Turn key to unlock 
&gt; column and pull the housing off. Find tiny screw that holds the 
&gt; electrical portion of the switch. R&amp;R switch. You don't need to remove 
&gt; the key cylinder housing unless the tab is broken or it is worn badly.
