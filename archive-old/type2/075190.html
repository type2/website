Subject: Re: [T2] tapping noise on new engin

Jambing a potato into or onto your tail pipe makes a near pefrect seal.
Any of the large variety works even sweet potatoes or a turnip.
No problem with the heat.

&gt; something flat and cover your tailpipe. If there is no exhaust leak  
&gt; present the the motor will quieten down and then shut down in fairly 
&gt; &gt; short order.
