now I find this....

thought this might help....although the catalog seems a little
outdated...
look under &quot;PLUMBING PARTS&quot;   for the water tank filler tube...
many people have asked about this including me....thought it might save
some posts and some time...
its through &quot;Go Westy!&quot; or something like that
any opinions on these guys/gals?
