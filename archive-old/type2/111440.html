Subject: Re: [T2] Removing the pulley.

Woodruff key is a half moon shaped piece of metal that
fits in a slot on both halves of a shaft and pully so
they will be locked together. Spraying of WD-40will do
more harm than good to a bearing, it washes all the
grease out of the bearing then it burns up. Take the
alternator to a shop and have them replace the
bearings and all should be well in busdome and watch
out for that wild woodruff key. Phil
