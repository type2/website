Subject: Re: [T2] rear quarter panel removal and replacement

On Tue, 6 Dec 2005, Christian Hogg wrote:

&gt; I have a '72 bus where the drivers side rear quarter panel (with the
&gt; vent) has been caved in (I believe the bus had been tipped over before I
&gt; purchased it). Anyway, I have located a replacement but I need to remove
&gt; it from the vehicle being parted out. The rear panel appears to be one
&gt; piece from the roof line to the wheel well/bumper. Does anyone know how
&gt; difficult or time consuming this is going to be to remove? It is held
&gt; together with the other panels by screws or welding? Any insight or
&gt; advice is very much appreciated.
