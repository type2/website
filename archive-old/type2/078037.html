&gt;I'm rebuilding the engine in my '71 Westy. Matter of fact, I've been doing
&gt;so for six months  -  through a humid VA summer.  In preparation for an
&gt;imminent reinstall,  I peeked at the bell housing and found that the
&gt;surface of the throw-out bearing is now  rusted.  This was a new part with
&gt;very few miles on it.
&gt;
&gt;Can I sand this with 400 or 600 paper to rejuvinate it?  Can I lubricate
&gt;its innards?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks, Jack
&gt;

Yes, do just polish the surface but not mirror bright. If 400 will remove
the rust, there is no risk of pitting. Note they come new with a matte
finish, not mirror bright. 600 is probably about right. You want the ring
to grab the fingers and rotate. With a mirror polish, too much slip would
result in overheating and excessive wear of the plate fingers. The bearing
is sealed and not designed to be lubricated. However, I have used
Lubro-Moly Hi Tack Lube Spray to add lubricant to sealed bearings. It is
penetrating fluid thin when sprayed but when the volatiles dissipate it
leaves behind a nice sticky grease. Of the dozen or more types of spray
lube I have tried, nothing comes close to this $15 per can German Product.
I use it every day in the shop, about 2 cans per year. With a used bearing
it must be wiped clean before hand or you risk carrying grit and filth into
the bearing with the penetrant. That would be much worse than just using a
good smooth bearing without improvising a lube maintenance not contemplated
by the designers.=20

Do put a straight edge across the fork fingers and verify that their plane
is perpendicular to the mainshaft. With a patient and skilled eye you can
see 2=B0 or more off normal (90=B0). If not true, take it out and to a
machinist along with photo copies of the appropriate clutch info and data
from Bentley and ask him to recurve the worn flat fork finger surfaces to
concentric arcs similar or sleightly shorter than stock radius.  Your
reworked German original is a far far better part than any replacements I
have seen currently available. Before you pull that x-shaft, unhook the
spring from the lever then push the shaft back and forth against the
bushings. If loose, order the bushing kit for replacement of the re-worked
shaft.
