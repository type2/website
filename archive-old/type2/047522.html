Subject: Re: [T2] trying to do my rear brakes and need help!

&gt; tapping on them with a hammer sometimes works..._dot_dead blow hammer even.
Are
&gt; they rusted on...or did someone use an air wrench on them?  Maybe just try
&gt; using a bigger 4-way on them?

The trick I always use for air-wrenched lug nuts is to take a sturdy
19mm/17mm box end wrench (I have Craftsman tools, it bends a little when I
do this but has never broke) and stick a 17mm tranny plug tool in the 17mm
end.  Then put a torque wrench (set real high) in the plug tool and the 19mm
end of the wrench on the lug.  This of course would be much easier with a
3-4 ft. breaker bar but I don't have one of those.  As far as brake spring
pliers go, it will make taking the two heavy springs off easier but that's
about it.  I never remove my hubs to do the brake jobs like the books say to
do, so brake spring pliers don't come in very handy for me.  I use a flat
head screwdriver to pry them back on.  Gook luck.
