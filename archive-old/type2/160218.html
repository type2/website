Subject: RE: [T2] Hydraulic lifter help

AVP offers moderately-priced rebuilds, I understand
that they do not automatically replace parts which are
still in spec.  Give them a call and ask about the
situation, they are usually helpful.

&lt;SNIP&gt;
My 80 Vanagon decided to give me some trouble lately.
Came up with a bad
lifter on #2 intake. Just finished pulling it out of
my AVP rebuilt engine.
NOT happy with what I see! The lifter is worn out. The
contact surface is
concave and the piston inside is worn out. I only have
about 4000 miles on it
since I got it. I don't believe it could have been
reground. The cam lobe
looks good though, suspect it was reground.
