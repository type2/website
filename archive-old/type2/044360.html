Alex -

It sounds like you're talking about the EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation)pipe 
that runs from the EGR valve connected to the left front of the air intake 
distributor (&quot;front is front&quot; in VW speak, so left as you're looking down at 
the engine).  If it is this pipe, it should run down to the cooling tin.  
Underneath the tin should be - depending on year/make (in my case, an '80 
Westy) - the EGR filter running to your exhaust.

If the above applies to your case, the hole in the pipe is a problem.  If 
your EGR valve is functioning &amp; not all &quot;gunked&quot; up, that hole is letting 
more air into the motor, causing the motor to run lean &amp; get hotter than it 
should.

If your EGR filter is intact, you might want to consider replacing the pipe. 
  If it isn't, you can run w/out the EGR.  You would basically need to close 
off the pipe where it attaches to the EGR valve.  This can be done w/gasket 
material &amp; a makeshift metal cutout (following the outline of the pipe end) 
beneath the EGR tube, then refastening the pipe to the valve.  You would 
then need to check your fuel air mixture.  There's some pretty good scoop in 
the archives on the whole enchilada.

I'm sending a copy of this to the list, as the procedures outlined above are 
based mainly upon info/advice given to me by other list members regarding 
the same equipment/different problem (my EGR filter was completely gone, &amp; I 
didn't have the money for a new filter - anywhere from $125-170).  So, if 
I'm 180 off, everyone, please sound off.

Hope this helps,

Mark
