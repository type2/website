&gt; List,
&gt; I'm about 95% convinced its gonna be cheaper in the long run and 100% excited
&gt; about installing a Subaru engine in my 71 Adventurewagen.
&gt; The engine is in a 2wd wagon - 87-88 I think. Haven't looked closely, but I’m
&gt; fairly certain  that the year would make it the ea81 - 1800 DOHC carb ?
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, a local conversion-crazy buggy shop can sell me the adapter plate, a
&gt; modded flywheel and pilot bushing for $300.  These guys seem to get good life
&gt; out of the conversions - usually mated up to a late model bus tranny.  Haven't
&gt; priced the Kennedy stuff yet, but I will.
&gt; 
&gt; My questions, which I hope will get some response, are as follows:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.Rear engine support - has anyone done this? Should I be able to use a modded
&gt; bus hanger bar?
&gt; 
&gt; 2. My bus originally had AC and the condensers are mounted between the frame
&gt; members (under the cargo floor) with a 12v fan blowing down through it. There
&gt; is a galvanized cover running between the members that is louvered open
&gt; towards the front of the bus.  Looks like an ideal spot for the radiator - run
&gt; the fan all the time.  Any thoughts? Will she cool with a stock jap rad?
&gt; 
&gt; 3. There is some talk of using the suby bellhousing.  Why?  Won't the adapter
&gt; plate allow me to mate the engine right up to the tranny?
&gt; 
&gt; 4. Exhaust. Am I looking at a complete fabrication?  Something like this looks
&gt; attractive as far as muffler goes: http://www.motorworks_dot_com/images/p9589B.JPG
&gt; .
&gt; Any experiences/suggestions?

Kennedy's adapter plate (model 4500) costs $460.00 for your transmission.
One thing you probably want to do, according to Kennedy, is to take the
transmission to have fourth gear welded--it's pressed together now.

Quick question: how are you doing your radiator?
http://home.earthlink_dot_net/~dmh012/v6vwp.htm?clkd=iwm shows a guy who put a
4.3-litre GM Vortec V-6 in a 1972 Loaf. Apparently it works, but there's a
lot of handwork in this thing.
