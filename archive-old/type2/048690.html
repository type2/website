By all means, measure the endplay. Must use a dial guage. Confirm spec. or
risk damage. Gland nuts should be considered as a torque once item. Use the
old nut to check end play. When adjusted properly, use a new gland nut to
spec. If that's not good enough for you, use a few drops of blue Locktite.
Why? 'Cause if it comes lose, it's a budgetbusterbigtime/money.
