Subject: Headlights Won't Work

The headlights on my 71 bus will not come on.  The parking lights work.  The 
turn signals work.  The emergency flashers work.  The tail and brake lights 
work as do the sidelights.  I have checked the fuse box to make the headlights 
are connected as per the Bently wiring diagram.  Since I am not an electrical 
wizard I need help.  What is the sequence of steps I should take or where 
should I look to sove the problem?
