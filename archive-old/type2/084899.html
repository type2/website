Subject: Re: [T2] heat exchanger &quot;rebuilding&quot;

I have heard that the wrap is bad for long term durability of metal exhaust 
pipes.

Two reasons: it traps moisture when they are not in use and overheats the 
metal causing it to fail.

Maybe instead use a double layer of metal or a wind break to keep the cold 
wind or road spray off of the metal. The elbow on the '78 exhaust system 
has a double layer of metal. On my friend's '78 the heater was excellent 
until about the time that this layer began rusting away.

Mere coincidence? I don't know but I cannot find any other reason for the 
system to lose heating capacity like it has.



&gt;I have pondered the thought of
&gt;wraping them in that fiberglass exhaust wrap that
&gt;people use to insulate their exhaust pipes.
