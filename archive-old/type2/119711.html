Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Re: [T2] Anyone using a B4 in their Bus

It's possible the BN4 I was using wasn't perfectly tuned.

But it did get better milage when I didn't use the gas heater as much.  Like 
when I hooked up the stock heat on a winter road trip, the stock heat with the 
bus warmed up was good  enough to not run the gas (h)eater much.   This 
resulted in better milage after the stock heat was hooked up.  It was noticable on 
a road trip cause every 3-4hours we stopped for a tank of gas.   So using the 
gas heater as auxilliary to the stock heater has better milage than using the 
gas heater as the sole heat source.  At least in the bus I was driving.

Anyway, I 'd fix the stock heat, It does help.  even if it meant rigging up 
some sort of tube under the bus.  I have seen gutter drainpipe installed for 
this reason.   Plus, wow, i can't imagine living without a defogger.

&gt; You'll find the gas milage is better if you use the gas heater as auxilliary

???? Really??? haven't noticed any improvement

&gt; to the stock heat.   I did at least.   Any reason you can't put heater boxes
&gt; on the motor?

I don't have any of the stock heating system left,  have J tubes on engine
and the duct work long ago rusted to oblivion.  and the gas heater puts
out more than enough heat to keep the bus warm....in fact the only time I
have problems is when I'm trying to just take the chill off and need
almost no heat just a tiny little bit. the gas heaters don't work very
well at &quot;just a little heat&quot;
