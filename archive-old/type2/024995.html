Subject: Scarry brake moment

I've been meaning to ask this for a while.

Last year I was coming off the motorway after a long stretch (2 hours +) of
running at 55mph ish. I was going down the slip road, downhill and went to stop
at the bottom. Suddenly I had that &quot;no brakes&quot; feeling although all that
happened was that the brake pedal went twice as far as it normally does. I
didn't feel at any time it WOULDN'T stop, it just shook me up a bit.
I pulled over in the next layby and looked for fluid leaks - none to be seen and
the brakes worked all right after that and have to date. Brake fluid levels look
OK. The van was well loaded but I just wonder what happened ?

Everything seems OK at present (well I can stop anyway and I have had a couple
of occasions to test those brakes !) and I have done some long runs with loads
up &amp; down steep hills since.
