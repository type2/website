Subject: [T2] smoke test

Gentlepersons-
                       OK, a little (very little), empiricism here...Wired a 
plumber's smoke &quot;bomb&quot; to the front cross member on my bus and had my buddy 
ride along side with
the thing lit and clouds of smoke coming from underneath. With the engine lid 
closed, he observed the smoke stayed mostly underneath the bus until it 
reached the rear 
bumper. Then it splayed up the rear of the bus and fanned away at about the 
belt line.
Lit another one and ran with the lid cracked open at the latch about two 
inches...Smoke
went under the bus but was sucked into and through the engine through the 
opening a-
round the lid.
                       This was at 25-30 mph straight runs. My guess is there 
is a Kamm ef-
fect because of the relatively flat rear of the bus...If your bus leaks oil, 
you've seen the same results...drops sucked up out of the airstream from 
underneath and depos-
ited on the rear of the bus. I'm wondering if a front air dam (ala the later 
Vanagons)
would change this pattern? Or would some sort of ground effects add-on serve 
to ex-
tend this air flow past the actual rear of the bus?
