Subject: parts reference

I have just been sent a copy of the parts reference for type 2s. It is
from Autobahn dpt. of VWoA. Are there any other such parts manuals out
there? Possibly from bap-geon etc? the one I have uses VW parts #s and
was last updated in '83. Thanks for any direct response with help on
this one.
