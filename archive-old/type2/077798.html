&lt;&lt; TIMING IS BASED ON DISTRIBUTOR!!!!!! &gt;&gt;

Steve,

I actually agree with you wholeheartedly.  I should have been more specific.

I was_only_referring to the process thats its my understanding someone with a 
really good ear can use to time an engine without a timing light or the 
official specs.  I personally wouldn't trust myself to do it, but I've heard 
that some can get them within just a few degrees of right on by rotating the 
distributor with the engine running and listening to rpm changes.

Sorry about the lack of clarity,

mark
