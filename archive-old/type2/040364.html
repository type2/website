Subject: 1st engine pull this weekend

hey volks,
well seeing my current state of compression, and a 3
day weekend coming up, im gonna pull the motor out of
lizzy.   i should be able to peruse the archives for
tips on droppin the motor as well as muir et al., but
i was just curious as to when i have the motor out,
besides assessing and fixing my current problem, are
there any other items worth replacing at that time. 
and remember i am just a poor guy dropping my bus
motor, ie., my wallet is way skinny!   but seriously
if there is anything i should look for to replace or
do while it is out, please let me know.
TIA
