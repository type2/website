Subject: A few questions before I begin....

Hi all,

Tomorrow I begin reassembling my engine, but I have a few last minute 
questions:

1. How important is checking the deck height at TDC?  The two books I have 
do not mention it in their reassembly directions...only the Muir book goes 
into it in the &quot;high performance&quot; section...I'm building my engine stock, 
with the exception of the ignition system.

2. An article a friend gave me about rebuilding a VW engine suggests fitting 
the distributor drive shaft before putting in the cam and crank 
shafts...why?  Is the procedure to install the distributor drive shaft in 
the Muir book adequate?

3. Anything else that I should make sure not to overlook?

--any advice greatly appreciated.
