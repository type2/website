Subject: Re: [T2] Back up switch/engine stall

OK, then-
Remove all wires from the negative side of the coil.
Install the points wire in that location.
Put the black wire on the hot side.
Start the bus. Put it in reverse.
Check that the reverse lights work now.
Go catch the bus.

&gt; Thanks for the insight, but the wire has been in the same spot since I got
the
&gt; bus. I have not touched it.

&gt; &gt; Try shifting several thousand times a minute.
&gt; &gt; Or, remove the black wire from the points side
&gt; &gt; of the coil and put it back where you found it :)

&gt; &gt; &gt; I recently installed a new back up light switch in my 69 bus (same
part#
&gt; &gt; that
&gt; &gt; &gt; came off), hooked it up, put it in reverse and the engine stalls. Take
it
&gt; &gt; &gt; immediately out of reverse and the engine kicks back on.
