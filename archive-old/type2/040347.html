Subject: Free 74 Beetle Tranny

I finally have something I can give away. WooHoo!! Anyway, I know it's not a
bus tranny but I also don't know all the applications for these so someone
might need it.  Like the subject says it is a manual transmission from a 74
Beetle.  The only thing that is wrong with it, as far as I know, is the left
side oil seal needs replacing and the bearings on the differential may need
to be replaced.  I don't know how much play those bearings should have so
they might be OK.  Anyway if someone lives in FL and wants to come get it,
it's all yours.  Sorry, I don't want to deal with shipping it.  I live in
Lakeland (smack dab between Tampa and Orlando).
