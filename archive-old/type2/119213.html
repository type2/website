Subject: Re: [T2] door latch

There's a couple on The Samba for $30ea used here
http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/classifieds/index.mv?alert+200312211818578250 .
Not sure what year they are for. www.bustedbus_dot_com  has one for '69-73 for
$24.95. You might try Ken at www.thebusco_dot_com  also for used. The only new
ones I've seen are for '74-'79's

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone know where I can get a new/used drivers side door latch
mechanism
&gt; for my 72 Bus?   Mine has apparently broken, and I drive it daily and need
to
&gt; be able to lock up.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for any help that you can give,
&gt; Rob :-)
