Subject: Re: [T2] Sealing a Hightop(converted)

Just cover it with your tarp when your at home , buy the tar rope, bring it
to HCBF and I and a few other guys will lift to roof off and do it right ,
put the tar on the line up the top and screw it down. No more worries and
the top just come off once!! And your done.!

&gt; i think i like the sound of that the best...(i think also i know what that
is (tar rope). thing is its sunday now and the only time i will have to do
this and of course no auto body suppliers open today not even sherwin
williams paint store ....
&gt;   i awoke this morning after a long hard storm and rain last night and
well.... the bus floor and bed was soaked.....
&gt;
&gt;   i got the silicone crap and even though i am tottaLLy freaked out now
about the thought of it rusting my bus even more and the silicone giving out
after awhile and all these bad things...
&gt;
&gt;   thoughts on temp use even though it will stil be in there....?
&gt;
&gt;   btw i did not find any acid free labels on the tube of silicone...
&gt;
&gt;   i gotta use it today to stop some of this water flow.. and we got more
rain expected...
&gt;
&gt;   now that i am not low enough to fit in my spot in the carport the wife
wins and the beetle hugs it all but that puts me under no cover till i get a
little metal awning deal built to the side of the carport  that will fit the
bus nicely under for rain and elements...
&gt;
&gt;   sooooooo  today i am hoping to take several screws out at a time and
fill the hole with the silicone and reinsert the screws while silicone is
still wet and hope that they seal her up till i can find some of the tar
rope and then will have ot set asida another day to redo it....
&gt;
&gt;   not what i wanted for my new hightop but everything has been a blur and
came together fast..... and with the upcoming HIGH COUNTRY campout just this
coming week.... i am shocked to even have the hightop on there to use... and
thankful....
&gt;
&gt;   thanks for all the info ... i am taking it all in folks... just money
and timing are hendering me from things right now...and it being suday today
and the suto stores closed or i would take back the silicone crap and get
some tar rope .... or permatex if i could find it anywheres? i know i have
seen that maybe i am looking wrong places?
&gt;
&gt;   and the wifes beetle is down right now as well...
&gt;   always something..isnt it~~!~
&gt;
&gt;   peace
&gt;   chai
