Yes , there needs to be a hot wire to #30 on the relay. Run a wire from a key -hot  (#15) off the fuse block to the relay. That should do it. Turn the key on, click the clicker and it should click. If not,run a jumper from ground to #31 on the relay. It should now click. If it does, you have a bad ground some where from the handle to the relay. Take care  Jim Duncan OUT
