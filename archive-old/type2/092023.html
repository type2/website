Subject: Now I've Heard It All!

Talking to my mother-in-law last night who told me astory about her Aunt
and Uncle who were hippies in San Fran back in the day and she said they
had a VW Bus too. Said it had all the hippie trippy flowers painted on
it and stuff.  Here's the kicker and she swears it's true. It had a
WATERBED in the back!

That is just too cool.
