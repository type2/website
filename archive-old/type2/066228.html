Gee sounds like a guy who has sold too many.  FWIW my '78 is
the or is a precursor to the &quot;champagne edition&quot; brown and white
chrome bumper, brown dash, deluxe model.  Indeed the marigold '77
is a standard.  Anybody know how the early loafs break down?
'68 was just velvet green or white, I believe both were available
in either trim.  And when did the red become available?
