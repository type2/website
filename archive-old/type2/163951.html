Subject: Help with brakes on a '71

I'm having a bit of a problem with the front brakes on my '71.  I
can't get any fluid through the front lines.  If I take the calipers
off and compress them with a clamp, they push fluid out, so I am
assuming they are working.  I just replaced the line from the master
cylinder back to the rear T, as that broke last time I was trying to
bleed the brakes with a friend.  Fluid flows the rear just fine, but
when I put the vacuum pump on the front bleeders, I pump it, build up
vacuum, pop open the bleeder and the vacuum just holds and nothing
comes out.

Am I doing it wrong?  Or is my master cylinder bad?  I am supposed to
be leaving for a trip over the weekend for a week of camping, and this
is the only thing holding me back right now.

There is a junkyard nearby with a '71 in it, so I can go and grab the
front calipers off of that, and the master and slave cylinders if need
be.  They may not work, but I can get them a lot quicker to try out if
someone suspects problems with mine.

Thanks for any replies!
