Subject: Valve spring broken

I'm the guy who rebuilt my engine a week ago. It was running beautifully
until yesterday. It satred running rough and acceleration was a chore so I
checked the compression 130,130,130,and 0 in #3. I pulled the valve cover
off and saw the problem right away. The valve spring is
broken...argggghhhhh! The valve still move smoothly so I;m hoping I can just
replace the spring and then take it somewhere to get the rest of them
replaced so this doesn't happen again. Has anyone replaced a valve spring
while the engine is in the car? Bently says you can do it with the engine in
the car but you need an air compressor to push the valve out and a special
VW tool 653/2. Is there any other way to do it?
