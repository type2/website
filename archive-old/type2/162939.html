Subject: Re: [T2]Help with 73 westy stay running

	A long shot, perhaps, Chai   ...    but
How does air bleed into the fuel tank as fuel drains out?  If that 
air bleed is blocked, fuel will after a while fail to keep flowing 
...
Crude test of this hypothesis is to leave the fuel filler cap loose 
so that air can enter there.


best of luck

&gt;i have got a 73 westy

...

&gt;   i can drive it for a little bit sometimes more than other times 
&gt;but still not getting far up the road before it will just die....
&gt;
&gt;   i try to crank it back up and it wont crank almost like it is 
&gt;flooded kinda symptom...  now if i sit there for a short bit she 
&gt;will crank up and act like she never cut off and run fine and then 
&gt;out of nowhere she will cut off again...
