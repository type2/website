Subject: Re: Sump Oil Temp Sender

&gt; We installed a sump oil temp sender and gauge and it reads no higher than
&gt; 180 on the highway.

Same problem here and the engine is definitely hotter than that.

Now how did you (or anyone else) manage to fit both the &quot;drain-plug&quot; sender
AND the oil screen? They interfered with each other on my 1600 and my
solution (for now) was to drill a hole in the screen as well.
