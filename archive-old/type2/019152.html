ok so here goes! i've been reading the list now for a few months, posted
a few questions, learned many things by reading and trial and error!
(can i digress a moment and curse the PO that had my bus before me?) i
have spent so many hours trying to make right all that is wrong, and
enjoyed every minute of it i might add :-) till now...it's the Kreeper
by the way, just got it back from the body shop, 4 weeks, but who's
counting? man that was a long four weeks..didn't know what to do with
myself on the weekends :-) looks great! new seals all around, they had a
guy polish the jalousie windows, yikes do they shine! fixed my bumpers
and painted the wheels and bumpers as well. sooo it sure is
pretty....however.....i am going to need a new motor the guy who pieced
together the motor  must have been related to Dr. Frankenstein  (he was
German right?) 3 out of four spark plugs are heli coiled, type 3 heads
on the 1600 dp, oil pressure sending unit tap sealed shut with aluminum
slag or something of the sort. so anyway, i'm tired of dealing with the
guys mockery of the art of mechanical engineering. anybody know of a
good, reputable engine builder in southern california? i'm looking for a
stock 1600 dp long block and i see them advertised all the time for
$500-$750 exchange-is that about right or low or not realistic? if you
read all this, thanks and i appreciate your efforts. will post some
before (ugly) and after for everybody to look at on my website sometime
soon!
Thanks,
Brian and The Kreeper
