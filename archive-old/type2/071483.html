I wrestled with the same questions for several months before deciding on a 77 
Westy.

IMHO the late breadloafs were the state of the art for air cooled Westys. The 
air cooled Vanagons have some technological advantages like a 3 way refer, 
but they are just not as &quot;cool.&quot;

Also the waterboxer engines only last 50k or less in most cases. They do 
provide better heat and can run an A/C in the later model. In general, parts 
and knowledgeable mechanics are harder to find for the H2O models as well. 
They did not sell well compared to the earlier models.

Good hunting.
