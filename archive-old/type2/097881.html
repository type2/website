Subject: VW test network in engine bay.

I am cleaning out the engine compartment, getting it ready for paint. The 
test network do-hickie that is attached to the top right corner of the engine 
bay, can I rip this thing out, or am I better off leaving it in? It has a 
series of wires that run to it, from the front of the van, enclosed in one of 
those black plastic sleeves.

I don't have the original tranny, engine, or carbs in there.

Thanks all.
