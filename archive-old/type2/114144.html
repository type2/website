Subject: Re: [T2] {FRIDAY} VW Cost Cutting was: LED Tail Lights

&gt;We just need to hop on a plane down to Brazil and walk in to a dealership
&gt;to try one out....remember that they are still making 1200 of them a month
&gt;and from the pics on the web, the interior looks mucho nice!
&gt;
&gt;I am more than ready to go when you call me with the ticket #'s!&lt;grin&gt;

Sounds just fine!!!

Right now as a working student/full time father/owner of a mortgage and car 
payment/full time husband and owner of a 25 year VW a tour of Knoxville (90 
miles or so from here) seems pretty exotic. Talk to me next year after I 
graduate.

Honestly I would LOVE to go through the VW factory in Brazil.

I need a rich relative. I mean a generous rich relative.... &lt;grin&gt;

Any rich people want to adopt me? &lt;grin&gt;
