A leaking diaphram will dump fuel into the case, not the heads.  I suspect
your problem is with the Kadrons -- specifically the floats.  I recently put
a new set of Kadrons in my daughter's car and one of the floats came NEW
with a hole in it.  When the float sinks the carb will keep pumping gas
trying to get the level in the bowl back up to level.

&gt; Some kind responders have suggested that a leaking diaphram in my fuel
&gt; pump
&gt; might be the cause of all the gas which has accumulated in my engine case.
