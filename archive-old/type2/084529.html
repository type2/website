Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Carbon removal

Scrape the big stuff off of the top with a paint scraper or razor blade 
(careful of things like cylinder walls), *then* use the wire brush.  It 
won't take much pressure to remove the last bit of carbon and won't damage 
the piston as long as you don't bear down on it.
