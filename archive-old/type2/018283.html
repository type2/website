Not sure what you mean here.

&gt; My question is how do I measure these parts to find out if they are stock 
or under sized etc.?  

Strip the case down to the bone. Don't throw anything out yet. Clean the case 
with high pressure wash, soap and water
whatever.Bolt the case back together empty and torque it to specifications. 
Now you need someone to measure the 
internal diameter of the main bearing bores. If you bring it to a machinist 
clean and ready, they might do it for like $25 bucks.
If not, buy an internal measuring tool (see books) and do it yourself. If 
not, box the case and send it to Riddle Machine Co. in
santa Ana, CA and ask them to measure, align bore/oversize/thrust cut as 
necessary and wait. While your waiting check the RMMW catalog
for main bearing numbers, compare them with the numbers on the backs of the 
ones you removed. Did you find them? It might
tell you what size (standard, .010, .020) yours were. Anyway Look up Storm 
Crankshaft in Mount Vernon New York and bring 
your crank and old bearings down there, once you get word from Riddle what 
size the ID of your case is going to be (what bearings
you'll need) You can buy the bearings from either place (I'd go with Riddle) 
but be sure the Crank guy knows the numbers and 
knows if he had to grind your crank down. Maybe your crank is bad, who knows? 
If so, you have an extra one.

&gt;Depending on which heads are not cracked I was even considering putting an 
engine together that is
&gt;1.7 on one side and 1.8 on the other (a 1.75?) I will also have to construct 
a test rig from an old transmission housing so I can
&gt;run the engine without putting it in a Bus.

The test rig is a good idea, but If you're sure about what you do every step 
of the way, the engine will run and you won't need 
the test stand. I'd avoid mixing 1.8 and 1.7 liter used heads, rather decide 
which size case you'll use, buy new pistons and cylinders
and have the heads done. good luck.
