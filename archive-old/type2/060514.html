Subject: re: subaru conversions

Weston and list,

Yes, I've seen a Subaru in a type II. It belongs to a guy named Mark
Chambers (former listee) who lives here in Prescott, Az. He mounted it
in a '60's crew cab. From the sounds of it, it was a lot of work.  He
likes it alot, but I bought an air-cooled and I'll stick with it.

Jaime
