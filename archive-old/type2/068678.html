Subject: Re: CD mounting for Bus - WAS : bus security (paranoids exposed)

OK, various people have mailed me and asked how I rigged up my CD
changer, and the security aspects..particularly the hidden compartment.

The 2 things I'll talk about are speaker positions, and the security
issues;

1. SPEAKER POSITIONS;


                                  FRONT
                       +--------------------------+     &lt;------ 3 ways
at each side in the
                      /                            \           
cardboard front panel beneath the dash
                     /                              \ 
                    +-----------+        +-----------+
                    !   seat    |        |    seat   !
                    !-----------+        +-----------!           
                    !___________+        +___________!
                    |           |        |           |
                    |   seat    |        |    seat   |
                    +-----------+        +-----------+
                    |                                |
                    |                                |
                    |                                |
                    |------                          |
                    |  c   |                         |
                    |  o   |-------------------------|
                    |  o   |         seat            |
                    |  k   |                         |
                    |--------------------------------|
                    |                                |
                    |                                |
                    |                                | &lt;------ 2 ways at
either side of the
                    |               bed              |         cabinet
above the bed 
                    |                                | 
                    +                                +
                     \                              /
                      +----------------------------+

The controller I put in the normal position in the dash, and I ALWAYS
remove the facia when I leave the bus.  I also modified the original
cover the for the radio 'hole' to clip over the blank controller, so it
is effectively invisible.

2. SECURITY.

I put the CD changer in the back, in the cabinet directly behind the
drivers seat;

            --------------------------------------
            |             front                  |
            |                                    |
            |                                    |
            |                                    |
            |------------           -------------|
            |           |           |            |
            |           |           |            |
            | seat      |           |  seat      |
            |           |           |            |
            |           |           |            |
            |------------           -------------|
            |           |           | CD CHANGER |  &lt;---cabinets
            |------------           -------------|
            |                                    |
            |                                    |
            |                                    |
The cabinet itself if made up of 2 sections, a top and a bottom
(ugh!)...the top forms the back of a seat, and the bottom is behin the
removable seat base;

+--+
|   \
|    \
|    |
|    |
|    |
|    |
|----|
|    |
|    |+--------+
|    ||        |
|    ||        |
|    ||        |
+----++--------+

OK...so I modified this setup as follows;

+--+
|   \
|    \
|    |
|    |
|    |
|    |
|----|
|    y
|xxxx|+--------+
|    ||        |
|    ||        |
|    ||        |
+----++--------+

Here 'xxxx' is a new shelf, and 'y' is the new 'fake' facia.  The CD
changer itslef was mounted onto the shelf, 'xxxx', and as luck would
have it, this leaves the perfect space for storing CD's next to it.

As far as the facia goes, I cut a piece of ply that exact shape, and put
2 long nails in the right hand edge sticking out to the right.;

+--------------------------------------------+
|                                            |
|   0                                        |========
|                                            |
|                                            |
|                                            |
|                                            |========
|                                            |
+--------------------------------------------+

The nails stick out about 2 inches (be careful to drill the ply first,
so it doesn't split!).

OK, now I drilled 2 holes in the side of the new cupboard for the nails
to slot into.

I then mounted one of those pop-in-pop-out magnetic catches onto the top
of the original shelf ABOVE the CD player, and put a washer on the facia
(see '0' above).

Now, to close the facia, push the nails into the holes, then press the
washer closed on the catch - looks like theres nothin there!  Make sure
you hide the wires, as these could give the game away...

To open the cabinet, press 'o' above on the facia, this releases the
catch - TIP here: make sure that the facia itself is as 'snug' to the
wood as possible - makes opening that bit 'firmer' - and means you
really have to KNOW how to open the cabinet to get into it.

Hope this makes sense to everyone.

As far as security goes, I'm also installing a seperate imobiliser this
coming week, and will let you know how it goes...

Jonathan.
