Subject: Parts needed - nice reward

Hi everybody,

I have converted my 72 Westy to a 2 Liter engine with california fuel
injection engine and an automatic transmission.
The conversion is no big deal and almost just a bolt in affair IF ONE
HAS ALL NECESSARY PARTS.

On final assembly I noticed that one required part is not usable and no
longer available.

This is the rubber hose that goes from the intake elbow to the
deceleration valve. The part number is 022 201 919 C. It is an A/T only
part because the deceleration valve on the A/T is different.

Also I seem to have misplaced some kind of hose adapter for the hose
that goes from the deceleration valve to the y-shaped part on the intake
manifold. Somehow the diameter of this Y-piece has to be reduced to the
smaller diameter of the deceleration valve tube. I don't know what this
part looks like.

It is these two parts I am looking for.

I am willing to make it worth anybodies while to send me these parts,
either through money or for example through a good nice original clock
for the type 2 dashboard. I also have all kinds of neat stuff to trade,
including Westy stuff and every imagineable FI part.

So check out your stockpile of parts and drop me a line.

Martin Peitz
