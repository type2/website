&gt;12 Tips From a Junior Associate to a Partner on
&gt;How to Enhance the
&gt;    Relationship
&gt;
&gt;__________________________________________________________________
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;    1.  Never give me work in the morning.  Always
&gt;wait until 5:00 and then
&gt;    bring it to me.  The challenge of a deadline is
&gt;refreshing.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;    2.  If it's really a &quot;rush job,&quot; run in and interrupt me
&gt;every 10 minutes to
&gt;    inquire how it's going.  That helps.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;    3.  Always leave without telling anyone where
&gt;you're going.  It
&gt;gives
&gt;    me a chance to be creative when someone asks
&gt;where you are.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;    4.  If my arms are full of papers, boxes, books, or
&gt;supplies, don't
&gt;    open the door for me. I need to learn how to
&gt;function as a
&gt;paraplegic
&gt;    and opening doors is good training.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;    5.  If you give me more than one job to do, don't
&gt;tell me which is
&gt;the
&gt;    priority. Let me guess.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;    6.  Do your best to keep me late.  I like the office
&gt;and really have
&gt;
&gt;    nowhere to go or anything to do.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;    7.  If a job I do pleases you, keep it a secret.
&gt;Leaks like that could cost
&gt;    me a promotion.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;    8.  If you don't like my work, tell everyone.  I like
&gt;my name to be popular
&gt;    in conversation.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;    9.  If you have special instructions for a job, don't
&gt;write them
&gt;down.
&gt;    In fact, save them until the job is almost done.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;    10.  Never introduce me to the people you're
&gt;with.  When you refer
&gt;to
&gt;    them later, my shrewd deductions will identify
&gt;them.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;    11.  Be nice to me only when the job I'm doing for
&gt;you could really change
&gt;    your life.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;    12.  Tell me all your little problems.  No one else
&gt;has any and it's
&gt;
&gt;    nice to know someone is less fortunate.
