&gt; I know this has been discussed before, but I'm looking for engine options
&gt; for my '71 Westie.  Right now, the choices are:
&gt;
&gt; 1600 DP
&gt; 1776
&gt; 1914
&gt; 1918
&gt;
&gt; (I would also consider a Porsche 914.)
&gt;
&gt; My requirements are simple:  reliability and &quot;adequate&quot; power.  I am
&gt; considering an air conditioner, but don't want to end up with so much
&gt; horsepower and torque that I overdrive the rest of the transmission.


&quot;Adequate&quot; varies from person to person.  For some, 3rd gear on hills at
35MPH is adequate.  :)

As others have said, the further you get from stock the more trouble you
will encounter.  Consider if the time saved while driving is worth the
time spent building and maintaining the big engine.  Of course, if
building engines is considered recreational you can shoot for the moon.

If you decide to go for the type 4 power, you might want to trade your bus
for a slightly newer one that is made to go with that engine.
