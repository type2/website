Subject: Re: Odometer and all things Electrical

&gt;I have two things I want to work immediately.  First, the
odometer is not working (supposedly just crapped out very recently).  I've
been using
the &quot;Compleat Idiot&quot; manual and just picked up the VW Transporter Owners
Workshop Manual
but neither mention anything about the odometer.  Any advice out there on
fixing it?&lt;

Have you checked the speedo cable? My odometer and speedo didn't work when
I got my '66. It turned out that the speedo cable was broken. The
instructions in the idiot guide for replacing it are quite good. It took me
about 10 minutes and ten bucks. Now my odometer works, but the speedo
doesn't (yet). If it's not the cable, it could be a broken gear in the
odometer. Some say that's easy to fix, others say it is like brain surgery.
The vanagon and vintagvw archives are chock full of info on this.


&gt;The bad news:
the red and green warning lights aren't working&lt;

You MUST fix this, or the bus can't tell you when _bad_ things are about to
happen (or just happened).

&gt;the fuel gauge isn't working (there is
a 6V to 12V conversion kit waiting to be installed), the horn doesn't work,
the turn
signals are not hooked up (as there is no turn signal switch installed
yet), and the
driver's side headlight goes on when the brakes are applied.  Oh, I almost
forgot, when
the headlights are on and the bus is turned off, the engine continues to
run until the
headlights are turned off.&lt;

ugh! I thought I had problems! (just kidding). It sounds like the wiring
job is FUBAR. The easiest thing to do is to follow where every wire goes,
make a &quot;before&quot; wiring diagram, compile your data, then compare it to where
the wires are supposed to go (this is especially easy if the PO replaced
all the wires with yellow wire, like mine did :I). I ended up putting
masking tape on every wire to label where it went.

Good luck. I got my bus in March, and it is the first vehicle I have ever
worked on myself. It can be a pain in the butt sometimes, but the fun and
learning factors far outweigh the negative stuff. Another perk (to me) of
being a VW bus owner is that people actually volunteer to help you
push-start it when it breaks down, and almost everywhere you go there is
someone who once owned or knows somebody who once owned or went with
friends to a grateful dead concert in a VW bus, and will readily tell you
all about it.
