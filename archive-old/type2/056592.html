Subject: Oil ALL over top of engine, 78 2.0 (long)

Hi list! I've just spent some time in the new archive and it is very nice!
Unfortunately, I was unable to find anything that matched my problem
exactly. I'm hoping the knowledge of the list will be able to help me out.
First, a little history. I'm the guy who bought the used 2.0 for my 78
westy, and while putting it in the bus it tipped on it's side (not hitting
anything, just tipped) and loads of oil spilled all over. This was an
engine I heard running and rode in the bus it was in about a month before i
bought it. So, I stopped the install and went looking for the source of the
leak. The consensus of the list at the time seemed to be valve cover
gaskets or pushrod tubes. Pulled the valve covers and sure enough there was
NO gasket on the left, and some weird really fat rubber one on the right.
Also decided to replace all the pushrod tubes and seals while i'm in there,
because the tubes that were there were really rusty. While I'm there, I
notice that the pushrod for #4 intake is not on its little cup on the
rocker. Huh? Obviously, someone has been in here since I heard the engine
run, and before I bought it! So, I replace all the tubes and seals with
nice shiny new ones, get the pushrods all in their little cups, fight with
that funky spring (what a PITA!), and get everything all buttoned up tight
with new cork valve cover gaskets. I'm thinking that I have sealed all the
leaky spots, so I go ahead and pop the engine in. Now, this engine had been
converted to a single Weber by the PO, and I was planning on returning it
to FI, but I ran out of money before I could secure all the parts I needed.
So, it's still a single carb engine. There are NO hoses from the engine
going into the air cleaner. There is a place for one, but it is plugged.
Now, the problem: Oil. Black gold. Texas tea. Everywhere. At first, I
thought it was leaking at one of my repair spots, so under the bus, check
the valve cover gaskets, no oil on the bottom. Peek at the pushrod
tubes-maybe that front one there is leaking a little, but it's hard to
tell. I pull the rocker and the tube, looks fine, put it back in. Start the
bus, let it run for while I fiddle with the carb, trying to get it to idle
(a whole nother post!), drive up and down the driveway, and notice lots of
little oil spots following me around. Park the bus, and watch lots of oil
dripping out the back of the engine. Hmmm, i think, bad rear seal? So, I
check the oil,top it up a little, and start her up again. I'm laying under
the bus looking for the leak. Nothing apparent from this viewpoint, but I
can see the left end of the oil cooler and it's dry as a bone. Nothing
coming out of the valve cover gaskets or pushrod tubes. Then I spot a
little drip coming out from between the bottom of the fan housing and the
engine case. Oh no, rear seal. Then I see ANOTHER little drip from the
FRONT of the engine. OH NO!!! Front seal-pull the engine!
All the above has transpired over the past four weekends. Now to the
present. Today I started her up again, and crawled under to pinpoint the
source of the leak. One minute, two minutes, FIVE minutes, no leak! HUH?
Seven minutes, drip, drip out the back, between the fan housing and case
again. Nine minutes and drip drip off the front of the case. I sigh deeply
and go shut off the engine. I open the engine cover and look for oil.
Nothing on the back of the fan housing, the fan hub area is dry. Checked
the oil pressure sensor, it is present and tight, light coating of oil on
the boot. Light  coating of oil on the  alternator pulley (rubber cover is
missing from the adjustment slot), and farther over to the right. I open
the rear hatch and pop open the top engine cover and peer in with my
flashlight. Holy frijoles! Oil is everywhere! There is a large (3 x 4
inches) puddle of oil where the tin over #3 meets the case. Oil is sprayed
all over the firewall, and up to the top of the air cleaner. Yikes!
Questions:
1. Do these symptoms point to blown front and/or rear seals?

2. Am I missing some vital crankcase breather hoses or PCV doodads?

3. If my oil cooler was leaking, wouldn't oil be visible on it from below?
(it is dry)

4. What is the large diameter (1-1.5 inch) hole near the top of the left
front of the engine where it mates with the trans? Should there be
something in there? Mine is empty and full of oil, but it probably just
sprayed up there.

5. Would this problem be related in any way to a severe lack of power under
load? It just bogs and dies when asked to pull even just a little. Idles
and revs fine when not under load.

Sorry for being so long-winded and I appreciate anyone who has taken the
time to read this far. Any thoughts? Any suggestions on what I can check
next? Thanks in advance for your time!
