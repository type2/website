Subject: RE: gaack msg: Joshua Tree -- brief trip report

Hi Nikki and thanks for stopping by at Jumbo Rocks.  We are Dennis and Cindy
Bergey from Santa Barbara, CA.  Cindy and I want to thank you for inviting
all of us from the list.  We would have never gone to Joshua Tree if it
wasn't for that effort!  What a great place.  We will go back again and
again.  We had no idea what a nice park that is.  Giant rocks everywhere.
Some awesome hiking trails.  Good vibes!

We arrived at Jumbo Rocks on Friday and got the last campsite at about 3pm.
We looked around for other Volkswagens from the list but didn't find any
till Jack came after dark in his '73 Westy.  We met some boy scouts that had
an '87 Westy in their group and chatted with the owner, Bob, for a while.

Saturday afternoon we realized we had not brought enough water so we went
into 29 palms for the night and got showers and rejuvenated at a local RV
Resort.

Sunday we explored the southern end of Joshua Tree including Cottonwood
Campground where we saw Nikki's, David's and Jack's VW campers parked.  We
were headed back to Santa Barbara at that point and only got a &quot;wave&quot;
goodbye from everyone riding in the jeep, however, it was a very nice
weekend and we met some nice people.

Hope to see you all at future campouts!

	Friday: My friend Virginia followed me out in my Samurai (for
accessing
	the roads to the old mines). David Schwarze showed up late Friday
night
	and actually found our campsite, even though we got re-routed to
	Cottonwood because Jumbo Rocks was full. I had called him -- yay,
cell
	phones! -- to tell him about the change o' plans and he was nice
enough
	to post it to The List before he left.

	We were parked next to an '89 Synchro Westy from Montana. I met them
at
	6:00 a.m. Saturday and chatted briefly while they packed up. They
were
	very impressed with our twin high-roof busses parked together. Then
I
	went back to sleep. I don't exactly shine at that hour.

	Saturday: We took the Samurai over to Jumbo Rocks to see who we
could
	scare up and we found Jack. We met some people in a Vanagon from The
VW
	Club and they recognized the names Nikki Elko and David Schwarze and
	said we were &quot;famous&quot; (I *think* that's good &lt;grin&gt;). We also found
some
	bus people over there who had never heard of The Bus List (&lt;gasp&gt;
they
	have now!). 

	We had seen a pop-top over by Belle Rocks so we stopped over there
--
	turned out to be a Swiss/German couple in a shipped-over Nissan
Urvan!
	They've been touring Canada and the States since July. We visited
with
	them for a while and took some pics. Nice people! 

	Phil Ruggiero showed up (sans bus, unfortunately) to visit briefly.
So
	here's the list of List people I've met so far:

	1. David Schwarze
	2. Craig K. (Austin)
	3. Mike Gensler &amp; Ginny (San Antonio)
	4. Art Lynch &amp; Kathy (San Antonio)
	5. David Christensen -- I hope I spelled that right (Phoenix)
	6. Jack Stafford
	7. Phil Ruggiero

	Sunday: We kinda ran out of time, but David, Jack, and I got to
explore
	some back roads. We found one filled-in mine and lots of cool rocks.

	Bummer I didn't get to meet more bus people! But it's always nice to
see
	David and I finally got to meet Jack, who I've heard so much about.
And
	let's not forget Phil's cameo appearance! (Hi, Phil!)

	Nikki

	P.S. It'll be interesting to see what we got in the way of pics,
thanks
	to David and his ubiquitous digi-cam.
