Subject: My latest evap cooler scheme for the cab

Last year George Lyle came up with an interesting scheme for an 
evaporative cooler designed to cool the whole interior of a bus. This go 
me to thinking about swamp cooler schemes, and especially about injected 
water instead of water in a mat.

This is what I have come up with, and I will be installing it in 
Peregrine over the next coming months, in anticipation of the forthcoming 
desert driving season:

The system uses part of the stock heating system, so to prepare that it 
is necessary to carry out the whole gamut of Bulley options, particularly 
insulating the ductwork under the bus and installing a forward blower. It 
is also necessary to go a step further and lightly insulate the vertical 
tube from behind and under the emergency brake.

The cooler itself is to be constructed of two pieces of 3&quot; PVC pipe 
running across the width of one-half of the under-the-cargo-floor space, 
about two feet apart, and several pieces of 1-1/2&quot; or 2&quot; PVC installed 
ladder-fashion between them. The larger tubes are air plenums (plena?), 
while the smaller tubes are runner/injectors.

A water injector is to be installed in each of the runners. There are all 
sorts of things that could serve this purpose; the first thing that comes 
to mind is the nozzle from an airbrush. There are all connected through 
small plastic tubes to a distribution box, and from there (through a 
piece of 5/8&quot; tubing) to a water pump and a water tank (also installed 
under the floor.)

(It's worth thinking about which side to install each part on. In a 76-79 
Westy arrangement for instance, it would be a good idea to install the 
water tank on the passenger's side to balance the load.)

Both of the plenums are closed at one end. The other end of the outflow 
plenum goes into a flapper valve that has been installed in the stock 
heating duct. A cable and a fourth lever (blue) control the flapper. Up, 
the system is ready for heating; down, for cooling.

The only thing that has me puzzled at this point is where to get the air 
intake. I am assuming that it cannot come from anywhere under the bus, as 
this would bring CO into the bus from other vehicles and from the bus 
itself. It would be nice to draw it from the fresh air vent in the front 
of the bus, if only it were possible to run ductwork from that system 
neatly into the forward plenum.

The intake shouldn't recirculate from inside the bus.

Last task: Insulate the whole system and screw on a sort of belly pan to 
protect it.

So: you push the fourth lever into the cool position, and switch on the 
bilge blower (a two- or three- position switch with poles that also 
control the pump). It will take a minute or two for the cooled air to 
cool down the duct work, but within five minutes or so you should have 
air 20F cooler than ambient air blowing out the heater vents.

But only in arid climates.
