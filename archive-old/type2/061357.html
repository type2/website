&gt; &gt;So the question: since it's a 4-stroke engine, shouldn't the 
&gt; &gt;valves on cylinders #1 and 3 be in the same position at TDC 
&gt; &gt;for #1?  

Isn't the confusion here due to the fact that there is a 2:1 ratio between
crank and cam rotations?  So one turn of the crank shaft is only 1/2 turn
of the cam shaft, thus the valves are not in the same positions on each
rotation of the crank shaft.  Thats why we use the dizzy rotor to let us
know, in essence, if this is an even or odd numbered rotation of the
crank (should I first have pointed out that the same 2:1 ratio exists
between dizzy rotor and crank shaft?).

Does this help or hurt the clarity of our discussion?  Is it correct?
