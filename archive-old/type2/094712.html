&gt;&gt; From what I can tell the ECU can accommodate an oxygen sensor on pins 
&gt;&gt; 24
&gt;&gt; and 23 (shield). Has anyone ever added a sensor to a federal vehicle?
&gt;&gt; Does only the ECU for CA support the oxygen sensor as I think the 
&gt;&gt; ECU's
&gt;&gt; for CA have different part numbers than the federal ones? One 
&gt;&gt; difference
&gt;&gt; is that the CA ECU's do not need the series resistors for the 
&gt;&gt; injectors.
