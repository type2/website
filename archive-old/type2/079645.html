Subject: More FI questions/woes


I posted earlier about a friend who gave me his 2000cc FI=20
engine, and of course now, after further examining the engine,
I have some questions.

It looks like someone removed the EGR filter.  The feed tube
has been cut-off and clamped shut where it bolts to the intake
air distributer (using terms from my Bentley...)  I assume that
this is a bad thing?  How would the engine perform in this situation?
My EGR valve (according to Bentley) is &quot;mechanical&quot;, is that the little
thingy with the lever that the feed tube bolts into by the intake? =20
Or is the filter/valve one and the same?

If the missing EGR stuff is no big deal, then the only other=20
component I appear to lack is the &quot;dual relay.&quot;  I didn't find
one at Bus Boys or AirCooled_dot_net.  Maybe, if I'm lucky, my friend
still has his on his bus (he now has a type I engine in it.) Oh, last
question, what is that silver/grey thing mounted by the fuel tank panel
(to the right, sorta near the ECU)?  It's about the same size as my Palm
pilot, but thicker and with rounded edges, looks like something plugs=20
into it.

Sorry for my ignorance, I come from a type I world and am new to type IV =

(and FI in particular)  but I am very determined and capable assuming =
the
parts can be found.  The junkyards around here (Wilmington, NC) seem to =
lack
later buses, so if anyone has a line on the afore mentioned parts, I =
would
be eternally grateful.
