One thing I found in travelling around in a bus is that I don't go on any
sizable trips without two spares.  One trip I had two belt separations in
less than 100 miles, and the tires were in good shape beforehand.
When you're stuck in Bishop, CA, the correct tires just aren't growing on
trees and the one I finally located suddenly cost a lot more than than it
would have cost to a local.  Not fun.  I finally found a used-tire place
that sold me a passenger-rated tire for $20 to get me 200 miles home.
