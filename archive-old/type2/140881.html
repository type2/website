Subject: Re: &amp;*^&amp;!!!! oil filter length and removal

I had a tough time removing the oil filter in my '79 bus and bought several
different oil filter wrenches until I found this one, I think, at Wal-Mart:

I don't know the manufacturer, but stamped on the inside of the filter is:

You have to tap the wrench onto the filter with a hammer until it's seated
firmly and then you can torque the s**t out of it if you want. ( I tighten
only 'til it's snug, and then a little more.) Works perfectly, every time. It
fits a 3/8&quot; drive socket extension.
