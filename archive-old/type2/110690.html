Subject: coil primary resistance-more is better?

I was installing a Compu-fire when i read that a ballast resistor must be used if the primary resistance is between .5 and .75 ohms.  So i checked my coil, it read 2.9;  I checked another one, 2.0; next was a blue coil, 3.4 and finally another blue coil, 3.4 ohms.
 
So is more resistance better?
