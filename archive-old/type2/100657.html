Subject: Goodies from Europe  (Finally!)

I know I promised this list almost a month ago.  Well, I got so tied up I
never had time to compile it.  Next week I go back to Europe already for a
new load, and I haven't even mentioned what was in this one yet!  So I
thought I'd better at least post details on the highlights.  I know I've
overlooked a few items, but I guess they'll have to wait until the list for
the next container load in January. A partial list's better than nothing, I
suppose...

Quantities on many items are limited, and not all of these prices are being
offered to the general public.  If a price comes up higher on the website,
don't worry. Just specify in the &quot;comments&quot; section of the order form that
you're a listmember, and the price will be adjusted before we ship.

Incidentally, I'll be in Germany from Saturday thru Wednesday (Dec 7-11), so
if you email me directly during those dates and don't get a reply, that's
why.  Of course email sent to the shop (sales_at_busdepot_dot_com) will be answered
as usual.  Alas, this also means I'll miss the Mid Atlantic Bus Van Fest at
Tom's house this year, which is a tremendous disappointment for me, as I
missed it last year due to another conflict and was really looking forward
to it this year.  I definately encourage everyone to go who can, as it's a
ton of fun.  I'll be enviously thinking of you all!

HELLA TAIL LIGHT ASSEMBLY ('72-79)
News of these &quot;leaked out&quot; a couple of weeks back, so some of you already
got yours. These are the fabled Hella ones, not the aftermarket Brazilian or
Indian ones.  Finally available again after a nearly two year backorder.
Who knows how long it will be once these are gone. Price includes one
complete assembly with lense.  $39.95  Part # 211 945 241RK.

CHILD'S COT FOR FRONT OF BUS - JUST $35
This is definately the biggest bargain in the lot. This is the canvas cot
that stretches across the front seat area in the cab of the bus. See John
Perry's page at http://www.john-perry_dot_com/vw/cot.html if you don't know what
this is. A Westfalia camper has brackets screwed into the door jams that the
poles sit on.   If you don't have a Westfalia, you'll have to find some
brackets from a junked Westy or just fabricate something. The $35 price
includes the canvas (white) and the poles. The included poles are the style
used in '74-75, which means they are one-piece poles (they do not retract
for storage like the original '76-79 ones did) but will fit thru 1979.
According to John's page, these poles are 1&quot; shorter than the original
'69-73 poles, so to use them on those years you might have to fabricate a
spacer, or simply relocate your brackets slightly lower so they're in the
same location as on the later busses.  (Of course the canvas is the same in
all cases, only the poles differ.)
At $35, these are an absolute steal, way below wholesale, and being sold for
less than the value of the canvas alone.  They were $100 in my last catalog!
A distributor in Europe was overstocked and dumped them to me for below the
manufacturing cost.  Part # 7001.

NEW SLIDING WINDOWS:
These fit the sliding door, and the window opposite it. If you have
stationary windows there, these will add a lot more ventilation. If you have
rusted out vent wing windows there, these will add ventilation AND do away
with those no-longer-available vent wings and $60 vent wing seals. These are
made by the OEM supplier to VW, and used on the Brazilian busses. Last VW
price in the U.S. was $400 each, 20 years ago.  Now $139 each (limited
quantity).  Part # 56631 (drivers side) and 56632 (passenger side)

GENUINE VW BATTERY HOLD-DOWNS
This is the factory clamp that clamps your battery to the tray. Yours has
probably been missing for years  They also fit the drivers side, if you have
(or add) an aux battery there.  $7.95.   Part # 2700.

REAR SOFA-BED KIT:
If you want to put a Westfalia-style sofabed in your non-Camper, this is
what you need.  This is the assembly that lets the back seat lift up and
pull out flush with the rear engine deck, like on a Westfalia.  It's
basically a set of OEM-style hinge asemblies (similar to the stock Westfalia
setup) with instructions. You supply the wood, fabric of your choice, and
foam padding. (This also keeps the shipping cost down.)  $99.95. Part #
98553.

GENUINE VW VALVE COVERS (TYPE 1 ENGINE &amp; WASSERBOXER)
I found some Genuine VW (Brazilian made) ones, for the same price as
aftermarket ones. $5.95 each.  Part # 113 101 475B.

GERMAN VW LEFT HEAT EXCHANGER, '72-74
Found more of these, just in time for the winter!  This is the genuine
German article, much heavier duty than the aftermarket ones made today (and
now cheaper as well) . Even one German with one aftermarket one will heat
better than a pair of aftermarket ones.  $139.95.  Part # 021 256 091M.  I
also have a small quantity of the &quot;accordian tubes&quot; that goes from the heat
exchanger to the &quot;Y&quot; tube on the body back in stock, genuine VW, for  $18.95
each (part # 8243).

FIAT 500L AIRCOOLED MICRO-CAR  $2850
Okay, admittedly not a VW part, but I thought I'd sneak it in here. Tiny
European cars are sort of a hobby of mine. I have another Fiat 500 and a
Mini Cooper (not the BMW one) that I drive regularly.  When I find a unique
car in Europe that strikes my fancy, and I happen to have extra room in an
outbound container, I take advantage of the opportunity to bring something
unusual to these shores.  This particular car looks like a sunroof Beetle
that shrank in the wash.  Rear-engined, aircooled, 2 cylinder 500cc.  A real
head tuner driving down the road, to say the least.  Details and pics at
http://home.ceinetworks_dot_com/~ron/fiat500.html .  Email me directly if
interested, as this is mine personally, not the Bus Depot's, and no one at
the shop knows much about it.
