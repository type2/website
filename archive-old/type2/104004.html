&lt;&lt; my first thought when i saw the engine was  that it as a compressed air

engine!!!!  In europe some small car work on compressed air!!  All you need is

a tank for the compressed air and piston!

 &gt;&gt;
 ...and a source of power (electric, wind, solar, bicycle pump...) to com-
press the air to fill the tank to run the motor. There's a huge volume of
air required to fill a motor repeatedly. The designs I've seen are mostly
for &quot;local&quot; use; limited range and top speed. Another problem with a com-
pressed air motor...No heat or AC, and no electricity for lights, etc. with-
out power robbing ancilliaries on the motor. I'm not saying it can't work,
just that the trade-offs are enormous...
