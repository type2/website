Subject: Back up light lense film

I have this film built up on my back up light lenses and have tried everything 
(vinegar,lemon juice,mean green, oven cleaner,scrubbing with scotch brite) to 
get them clear and nothing seems to work. It's not in the glass because you can 
scratch it off with your fingernail, at least my wife can but she won't sit 
there and scratch it all off for me. has anybody run into this before and what 
what was used to remove film.
