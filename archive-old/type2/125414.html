Subject: Painting Forums. Kinda off topic.

Hey hey. I've got a few painting questions, and I was wondering if anyone
knows of any good forums on AutoPainting? Like a HotRod or Custom Car painting
forum or something like that. I'm looking to know techniques, products, Tips
and Tricks, etc, etc,.

I was gonna save this for Friday, but I'm out of town this Friday. :)

Cheers
Chris
