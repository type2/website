Subject: Re: [T2] 73 bus with 83 subaru engine so far so good!

Richard Jackson reported on

&gt;about 2500 miles so far

	with his '83 Subaru water-cooled motor.

Altho' Richard is laconic about difficulties with water piping, I 
imagine he's had his share, as has our other 100 mph Soobaroo 
convert.  And displaying a radiator on the front may tend to spoil 
the 'hot VW' image.
   I wonder whether a radiator is really needed.  Finned copper piping 
(which I merely assume to exist  -  you'd think I'm an economist) in 
a loop to a heater by the driver's feet i.e a small radiator might 
get rid of the heat well enough?  The mini-radiator would presumably 
take the full flow, and be &quot;turned off&quot; by a flap ducting the hot air 
from it away from the cab.  I loosely guesstimate that the total 
finned metal in this layout would roughly equal what's in a Subaru 
radiator.
