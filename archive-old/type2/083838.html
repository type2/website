Matt,

Hold on to your short's and your check book---

Changing color's is a big money proposition--

Unless of course you are going to leave the door jams, and interior the
old color----

Mucho Large Denaro's----

Off the top of my head without seeing the Bus--- and without any further
pertanent DATA-----your looking at 4 to 5 large---easy.

And this is assuming you want it done with current automotive type
materials----


Later,

Terry
