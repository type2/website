Subject: Re: [T2] [type2] How much Vinyl for back of 72 westy?

I have a '78 Westfalia with he top bunk. I was using a friend's '78 Riviera 
which also had a top bunk for some material estimates.


 &gt; &gt; &gt;I &quot;think&quot; 11 or 12 yards depending how well you
&gt; &gt; lay out the cuts.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I asked this question once and got a few numbers
&gt; &gt; in the 12 yards range.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I took a friend's Riviera to a local upholstery
&gt; &gt; shop and got an estimate of
&gt; &gt; &gt; 12-15 yards including the top bed.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Good point. I didnt include a top bed in my 11-12.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt;Buy top bed do you mean the upper bunk?  Mine's the
&gt;factory cot type, but again in the '72 is the rear
&gt;facing seat too (but you know that).
