&gt;Well i'm almost at the end of my rope. Im trying to install an original
&gt;german right side 72-74 heat exchanger from the busdepot ( i love those
&gt;guys) on my 78 westy and cant get it onto the cylinder head. even with
&gt;the studs remove the exchanger will not mate to the head (ps i purchased
&gt;new studs and they seem loose in the holes is this acceptable?) i am

NOT AT ALL, exhaust studs must be rock solid tight.  they are 9mm on
one end and 8mm on the other, make DAMN sure you got the big end
in the hole.  If they are still loose, take em out, overtap for 10mm and use
bug style oversize studs.  Always use a torque wrench in steps to
attach the boxes/header tubes once you get them on BTW.  And good
stainless nuts are my favorite as copper ones plating is usually only
skin (and thin skin at that) deep.

&gt;going nuts, my head is marked AMC so i know its not german.  I ground
&gt;some of the side of the pipe of the heat exchanger to see if it was just

Nothing wrong in this manner with AMC heads, their eventual failing
will be their seats, but the machining is as good or better than German.
The exchangers should not hit anything, should be generous clearance
all round.    If for some reason there isn't you can freely grind at those
cast or (forged?) steel parts that bolt to the heads, but you shouldn't
need to.  And you need to keep the mating surface nice and clean.

&gt;sure i didn't get dansk parts to avoid the problem i now face. im
&gt;getting close to bringing my bus to the local vw specialist to have them
&gt;deal with the problem but i don't like other people working on my car.

Well like I've said, I've never had much issue with Dansk either but new
German is nice.  A thought that is a good tip for anyone installing
bus exchangers, particularly round port exchangers.  Go ahead and drill
out the exchanger mounting holes up a couple of sizes.  This can really
save your but in alignment issues and more importantly in letting the
copper O-rings seat correctly.  The holes are about 21/64 or so
nominally, you can drill em all out to at least 23/64 and even maybe
an even 3/8&quot; or so.  Those flanges are real, real, hard BTW, use a good
bit, oil, and a nice heavy duty drill.  If there is a problem so great that
this
doesn't solve it, you got issues, and I'd guess the exchanger more
than the head.  You have to have the things lines up perfectly when
you slip em on with the stock size holes BTW, sort of at an angle
but not if you get my meaning.  One last thought is use a good
ceramic based exhaust jointing compound on the copper rings
both sides to forestall any future possibility of leaks.
