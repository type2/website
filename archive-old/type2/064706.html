Subject: 3,000 miles on rebuilt engine

hey now,

well, i've made the 3,000 mark on Rumba's rebuilt engine. no major or really
minor problems to report. will be checking the valves once again hopefully
tommorrow weather permitting.

just out of curiousity, how many miles does it take to break in an engine? is
rumba broken in now?
