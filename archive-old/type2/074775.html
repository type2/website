Subject: Re: [T2] retractable seat belts


They ought to go right in, though it may take some finagling to figure out 
precisely how. Mine are from a bug, and they went in fine. I also examined 
belts from Toyota mini vans, and Dodge Caravans, which seem like they would 
have worked just as easily.
