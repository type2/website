Subject: RE: [T2] carb air filter question

Donsco is a great VW shop.  One of my friends just totally rebuilt an old VW
Bug (not sure what year or model since I haven't actually seen it yet).  He
made heavy use of Donsco, and when he found out that I'd bought a Westy, he
immediately told me to check them out and keep them in mind when searching
for parts.

&gt;Mike,
&gt;
&gt;I have the same filter and so far, the only place I have found them is on
&gt;the net at  &quot;Donsco&quot;. They're a VW parts house in Cal. Good folks and a lot
&gt;of parts, decent prices. I typically buy from &quot;list&quot; vendors first but
&gt;sometimes you gotta go somewhere else. Do a web search and I'm sure you'll
&gt;find them.

&gt;&gt; Michael,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Or, I am sure that they would be happy to sell you a new complete
&gt;&gt; after-market chrome air cleaner that takes  *round* filters.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Available in the &quot;hot rod&quot; aftermarket section of most flaps...
&gt;&gt; Make sure round will work for you and then buy the diameter and height
&gt;&gt; that fits well.....buy them by &quot;neck&quot; size or take your old air
&gt;cleaner in
&gt;&gt; and match it.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Cheers, dave

&gt;&gt; &gt; Hi All,
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Just getting the bus ready to run and I am having a hard time finding a
&gt;replacement air filter for the Holley/weber progressive carb that is on my
&gt;2.0.  The filter unit sits right on top of the carb between two chrome
&gt;plates (one on top and one on the bottom).  It is about 5x8 inches
&gt;rectangle
&gt;with a paper/metal mesh in a rubber housing.  I took the old
&gt;filter to FLAPS
&gt;and they looked at me as if I was smoking something.  Maybe I was, but you
&gt;have to be able to get replacements somewhere.....
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks,
