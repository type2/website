Subject: Vanagon Throttle Cable Installation Tips and Tricks

First my thanks to Jason Laster and Tom Young for their advice.

Secoond, if the tube is clear then there really are no tips but there are
interesting differences between the vanagon and bay.  The vanagon cable
has a barrel nut at both ends rather than the dog-leg hook at the front
that the bay has.  Same socket for both nuts and you need a vice-grip for
the front nut as there is nothing to prop he swaged end against.  The
Vanagon cable has a sleeve at the front of the cable to catch the bellows
gasket that keeps water out of the guide tube (As Tom advised me, this
gasket was perished and will need replacing at some future date).  If the
tube is clear it is a matter of pulling the old cable and pushing the new
one.

Tricks I know that I did not need, but that is useful:

If you tie a string to the end of the old one and pull the string thru the
tube with the old cable it can make pulling the new one possible, which
may be easier and certainly makes cleaning the tube easier if need be.

If your tube is badly blocked by rust (as Jason reminded me) a length of
old clutch cable chucked into a drill will clean it out.

If the tube is crimped by s atone-ding you can, with some patience usually
open it by reforming it from the outside with a pair of vice-grips.  Its
an art, tho, so do it slowly with many small adjustments.  Cutting the old
tube off and welding a new one in if you screw up is a metric bear!

Save the swaged end of the old cable and ~3-4cm of cable attached.  When
this new cable breaks (it will, it will) it is possible to lap the ends
and grip with a vice-grip and get home.

OOK! (he said returning to the closet :-)
