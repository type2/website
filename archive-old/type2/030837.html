Hi, my name is Brian, I have a 73 campmobile,first year of the fully automatic
trans.Bus only has 78,000 original miles, but tranny slips shifting between
2nd and 3rd. Talked to 2nd owner he said it did this since 20,000 miles. Fluid
is fine,no metal shavings, so I drive it. any suggestions? Please put me on
your mailing list. THANKS
