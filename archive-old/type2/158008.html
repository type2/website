Subject: Re: [T2]1700 change to FI?

Hi Doktor, and welcome back to the list.

I did some considerable research before I converted my carb'd bus to  
L-jet two years ago and would like to add my $0.02 CDN to this  
discussion.`

&gt; 4) The components for the 1800 FI will not correctly feed a 1700  
&gt; engine. If you go with all 1800 FI
&gt; parts, you will still not have a proper mount for the head temp  
&gt; sender, and no FI head will fit
&gt; the 1700. Any method you use to hold the temp sender tight to the  
&gt; upper head will work, though
&gt; cold running enrichment may take longer to adjust due to slower  
&gt; heating of the sensor. This could
&gt; be bad news if you do a lot of short run driving.

Why wouldn't the 1.8L L-jet work for a 1700??? The difference in  
displacement is only 5.5%. L-jetronic FI is controlled by the Air- 
Flow meter, so the ECU doles out fuel to the engine based on the  
amount of air being drawn into it. 5.5% less air (displacement) will  
correspond to 5.5% less fuel. There may be some minor adjustments in  
the mixture curve but I expect that 5.5% should be within the margin  
for error. I have swapped successfully components back and forth  
between a 1.8L and 2L L-Jet FI configuration on my 2L engine without  
noticeable effects showing on the cylinder head temps. It might make  
a difference up near the redline but the ECU puts the redline at 5500  
RPM where sane drivers fear to tread.

&gt; 5) Get the adjustable fuel pressure regulator from an early 914  
&gt; Porsche. Should be able to drop
&gt; the fuel pressure with that to tune the 1800 FI to the 1700 engine.  
&gt; Using an exhaust gas meter, set
&gt; the mixture screw on the AFM to about 2 turns up from bottom, then  
&gt; adjust the fuel pressure regulator,
&gt; reducing pressure until the mixture leans out. Then use the mixture  
&gt; screw to make the final adjustment.
&gt; Another way to go is use the injectors for the 1600 T-III FI motor  
&gt; and increase fuel pressure for the
&gt; 1700.

Rather than mix and match parts and second-guess the designers, why  
not go with a complete 1.7L D-jet Fi setup from a 411, 412 or 914?  
They used a lot of common parts with L-Jet but had smaller injectors.  
Failing that, go with a new aftermarket system like Megasquirt that  
has already been tested in a 1.7L configuration. You don't have to  
reinvent the wheel.

&gt; 6) You mentioned the fuel tank before. Easiest to rob one from any  
&gt; FI Bus rather than trying to convert
&gt; the original carb fuel tank.

When I converted all I had to do was put a T in the line from my  
original tank. I have checked the fuel pressure with the T in place  
and with a direct line running back to the tank filler hose and there  
is no difference.

There are lots of ways to skin this proverbial cat. I haven't heard  
too many success stories with the CB performance dual solex setup, so  
I thought I would contribute my own experiences.

Happy trails,
