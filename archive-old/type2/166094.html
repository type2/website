This wouldn't explain why the bus won't start up with starting fluid 
after it dies.  Assuming that the longblock is in good working order, 
the engine should run just fine on starting fluid.  So, it's either 
getting flooded and dying out, or the ignition is going out.  If it were 
a clogged tank, bad resistors, bad efi wiring harness, or anything else 
to do with fuel, it would still start easily on starting fluid.
