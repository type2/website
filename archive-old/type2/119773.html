Subject: Re: [T2] Was: Slick 50 - now Marvel Mystery oil

Marvel Mystery oil, have heard good things about it
but a long long  long time ago(1960), in a different
world, we (Navy) ran test on the R-3350 aircraft
engines using additives, we had some that did increase
the life of the engines,Drastically. this is where the
slick-50 and others of such claims come from and some
of them actually work. I have my flame suit on so let
me have it... Phil
