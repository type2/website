&gt; I have them out of the tubes laying on the work bench.  They look gummy.  I

&gt; that?  Carb cleaner?  brushed off with a wire brush?...Sanded? polished?  they
&gt; were working fine when removed.

It only really matters if the insides are dirty and that requires sonic
cleaning.

Just clean the outside enough so the small seals make perfect contact. Use a
soft cloth and some carb cleaner. Clean the part of the intake manifold
where the injectors seat.
 
&gt; are the tubes from the air body to the injectors interchangeable from side to
&gt; side?

No (022 133 201 D right, 022 133 202 D left). You'll know early on when
you've mixed them up.

&gt; any thing else I should know or do before reassembling the injector
&gt; assemblies?

Remove the rust/sludge build-up from inside the intake manifolds if any.
Replace the 4 intake runner hoses.
Replace the hoses on the injectors.
Replace the 2 intake manifold gaskets if necessary.
