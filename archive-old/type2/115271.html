Subject: torsion bar swap

I have just replaced my from Beam from my 68 Westy and found the upper torsion
bar is so tired that when the change was made it dropped the front end as much
a 4&quot;.Some how the PO loaded the from torsion bar before installing the arms
giving the front an extra &quot;lift.&quot;  I have a 74 parts bus and am wondering if I
can swap the torsion bar/s from the 74 to the 68 with out any more headaches.
If not then how can I re-load the from to get 1/2 of the 4 inches back. My
overall goal was to lower the front by 2-21/2&quot;but 4&quot; is was too much.
