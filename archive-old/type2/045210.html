Subject: [T2]Wire retainer under rocker arms
Content-Disposition: inline

Hi Volks,

Question for you all. That wire retainer or spring under valve cover,
should it be touching the push rods? If so, this brings up another
question. Do they wear out often and should I keep an eye on it?
I just replaced a pair of push rod tube seals and want to be darn sure I
put everything back in the right place.

Thanks,
