Subject: Re: So I call in sick to work on my bus..

Update:

Timing is dialed in.
Carbs are as dialed in as I've ever gotten them.
Valves are set.
Fuel pump is pumping nicely.
Tank is full.
Pertronix back in.
Not overheating.
All new fuel lines.

I'm still getting fuel starvation symptoms. At WOT the power drops off
quickly.

Only two things I can think of at this point: Leak in my new lines, or
compression.

I picked up a new compression gauge since my old one didn't survive
much after arriving from Cali. I'm also going to check for any soft
spots in my new lines .

Anything else I can check without a carb or engine teardown?
