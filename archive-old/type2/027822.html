Thanks to all of you on the list who responded to my post about my mexican 
longblock that I got from BFY in Orange. Just to recap. A friend of my 
bought an mexican longblock from BFY and when we got home noticed that the 
heads had been taken off, which worried me. I called them today and they 
told me that they do all of the mexican longblocks they get because of 
complaints of oil leaks at the base of the pistions. This sounds logical but 
I have a mexican longblock that never driped a drop of oil. I do not know if 
the guy is just bulls*iting me or what. The motor seem to have never been 
run, which eliminated that the motor was returned by a customer. As of now I 
think I am just going to install it and see how it goes I have feeling it 
will be ok.

BYW Many people responded back to with the information that there is no 
warrenty offred with these motor. But everybody responded back that they are 
very happy with their motor. I have about 12K in mine and got 27mpg on my 
recent trip to L.A. ran nice a cool too.
