Subject: Re: [T2] 2.0L AFM whistle

Right after I bought my 79 I had this same problem. It took me a while
to get around to finding/fixing the problem. I would suspect a vacuum
leak which would also explain the rough idle. After I found the leaks
&amp; fixed them the strange whistle went away and it idled great. Here is
how I check for leaks. With the engine running spray small amounts of
starter fluid around at parts that look like they might not seal
correctly. When you happen across a leak the ether in the fluid will
richen up the mixture &amp; cause the engine to temporarily increase
speed. Fix. Repeat. Good Luck.

&gt; the rough idle and the near overwhelming fear of overheating her, I've
&gt; encountered a whistling that, to the best of my knowledge is coming from
&gt; the AFM unit itself. I listened to it with the air filter off and on. It
&gt; nearly sounds like a type of whistle from a bad seal on some front door
&gt; windows. With higher rpm's it seems to go away and at near stall the noise
&gt; gets chirpier.
