Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.05.9905150904140.8504-100000_at_mtolympus.ari_dot_net&gt;

Mr. Blansten subscribed to the Type2 list about three weeks ago.  He began
his subscription by sending a &quot;test post&quot; to the list.  It is clearly
stated in the charter, which is sent to each new subscriber (I have
checked, it is being sent), that test posts are strictly forbidden.  As a
result, I moderated posts from him.  His next series of posts was an
alternation of ads for items for sale on ebay and further test posts.
Because I had received complaints about posts advertising items on ebay
when such ads had appeared before, I decided to survey the list and see
what the overall sentiment was.  The results of that survey were
overwhelmingly negative and I announced that posts advertising items on
e-bay would be moderated, and passed rarely.  He has apparently decided to
harvest addresses from posts to the list and yesterday he sent a spam to
these addresses.  As a result, he has been removed and banned from the
list.

I do apologize to those of you who got spammed.  The mailing list is
protected, but manual harvesting is still possible, if you are determined,
and there is little I can do about it except to let your ISP know what is
happening.
