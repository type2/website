Hi folks,
   I'd like to be able to tow a small trailer with our 71 westy.  What does 
a trailer hitch for an early bay look like?  A verbal desciption would be 
great, a scetch even better, and a hitch to sell to me would be great.  I'm 
just looking to tow a small trailer to carry some bicycles.  Since the bikes 
are tandems a regular type of bike rack is out.
