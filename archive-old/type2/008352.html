&gt; I'm not saying I think it's ethical to sell VIN plates, but I think
the
&gt; chances of a bus being stolen and having different VIN plates
swapped in is
&gt; pretty remote.  Think about it - if the bus is nice enough to steal,
it is
&gt; probably well known in the VW community already.  I don't see it
happening
&gt; very often.

The really famous buses out there aren't likely to be stolen since
they are garage queens.

The buses I am worried about are the daily-driver type that are more
theft-prone.  Even with a few dings, many buses are worth enough on
the used market to make it worthwhile for a crook to graft on some
newly-purchased serial numbers.  Repaint the bus or take it out of
state or country and it disappears without a trace!  How many Japanese
collectors would turn down a good rust-free split or pickup for a few
thousand bucks?

Not a bad profit for a few minutes work with a pop-rivet gun!
