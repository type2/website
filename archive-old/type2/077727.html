Subject: Re: [T2] Re:  Replacement 205/70/14s

Oops.  While you are mistaken about the 10cm
wider, I meant to say 1 cm wider (or less than
0.5 inch).  205 means 20.5 cm's vs. 195 meaning
19.5cm.  Right?  

195 tire is 7.9 wide and 205 is 8.2 according to
Bridgestone_dot_com looking at BT70s (tire chosen
randomly).  Actually widths vary from
manufacturer to manufacturer and depending on
wheels and tire pressure as I recall.  

Your not giving up much width going from 205's
down to a load rated 195.  

I think I accidentally cross-posted this to type2
list.  Sorry folks.
