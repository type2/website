Subject: Re: [T2] Propane fuel conversion on 1977?

Someplace I read about, England maybe?, outlawed LPG in air cooled VW
because exhaust was used for the heat exchanging.

 The problem is you need to convert the propane fuel from a liquid (it
is a liquid in the tank) to a gas (LPG carbs are gas/gas).  In a
watercooled system, this is accomnplished by heat exchanging with the
coolant.  Not possible in an aircooled system.  However, one could
just as easily use the air-cooled coolants (the air or better, the
oil).  One just cannot buy a ready made heat exchanger like this, thus
this needs to be engineered.  Not that big a deal, really.
