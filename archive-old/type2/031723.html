&gt; I need to replace my 2000 cc long block for a '79 bus.  I
&gt; have found two different suppliers on the net.  Living in
&gt; Hawaii there are no other options than shipping from the
&gt; mainland.
&gt; 
&gt; I would like any positive or negative about the two
&gt; suppliers as to make the best choice on long block to get. 
&gt; They are &quot;GEX&quot; and &quot;AVP&quot; both from California.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone had any experience with either?

the question is, &quot;has anyone had a good experience wih GEX&quot;??

check the archives for both. many many experiences related.

but my nickle, RUN as far and as fast as you can away from GEX..

my documented story is in the archives
