Subject: Re: clutch

My Bus is from CA so it may wel have been FI. There
are all kinds of wires in there that are not connected
to anything. The engine however is not original. It is
a 1.8, thats all I know about it. The bus will start
on occasion so I think the flywheel is correct. I
wrote to the list saying that when I push the clutch
in all of the way, it doesn't fully engage( read I
have had some practice at shifting without aa clutch)
and the major concensus was that my pressure plate was
bad. I believe the Tranny is original. I bought the
bus with a 1600 bug engine in it with not much cooling
tin and a leaking oil pump from the adapter used to
mount the rear of the engine. So most people are
saying to go with the 215mm so I think that is what I
am going to do.

&gt; Thanks,

&gt; Your vin number (ignoring the first two digits) is
&gt; much later than this one,
&gt; so I'm guessing you have a fuel injected bus.
&gt; 
&gt; you would use:
&gt; 
&gt; Clutch Disc, 215mm, Fuel Injected, M/T, 1800cc DE
&gt;  
&gt; Bus 74-75 (from chassis number 214 2125 001) 1800cc 
&gt;  
&gt; part number:  025 141 031H

&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Assuming, of course that your engine &amp; transmission
&gt; are original or correct
&gt; for your year (late 74)
