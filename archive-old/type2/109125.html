Subject: Re: [T2] new temperature sensor source?

Bus Depot has them
http://busdepot.webappcabaret_dot_net/details.jsp?partnumber=0280130017 .
Other vendors also have them.
http://store.cip1_dot_com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&amp;Product_Code=BOS-0-280-130-012&amp;Category_Code=17-04

 They are a common part and not hard to find.

&gt; Hi,

&gt; It fits in the cylinder head just behind the #3 plug and tells the
&gt; computer the engine temp. so it can adjust the mixture.

&gt; Is this item still produced?

&gt; Bus Depot doesn't list them and my local VW dealer couldn't seem to
&gt; find it by the part number ( I may just need to go in person instead
&gt; of calling..._dot_usually you get better service face to face).

&gt; Is this a hard thing to find new?
&gt;
&gt; If not, I call Bus-Boys or keep searching.

&gt; Sincerely,
&gt; -- 
&gt; --Wil
