Subject: Re: [T2] Vac Hoses

FI buses that use a dual vacuum unit distributor use a throttle housing that has a 2nd vacuum port that only
goes to the retard side of the dizzy.     i.e. 75, early 76, and 79 Calif.
The 2nd port is pointing to the rear and is below the idle speed screw. It is larger in size than the other
vacuum nipples.


Original question:
&gt; &gt; My 75 FI bus has what looks like 2 vac ports on the throttle body - can
 someone tell me what connections need to be made here- I believe the port on
 the firewall side of the throttle body links to the distrib - does the front
 port link with the pressure reg ?

A reply:
 &gt; The small port off the throttle body goes to the distributor &amp; the air
 cleaner. the larger port (actually on the manifold) goes to the decel
 valve &amp; the pressure regulator for the FI.
