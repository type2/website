&gt; The area of the 1600 is 8.9 square inches
&gt;Using some more math we get force = psi X area.
&gt;
&gt; The 1600 stocker has a force pushing on the head of
&gt; 3,008 lbs!

Mmmm. Doesn't smell right. It has a force of Xlbs/area of combustion
chamber. Analogy's not quite right; it isn't a sledge in the head, that
would rip the studs out. After all, we want as much of that force as
possible going the other way, absorbed by the piston--otherwise it's wasted
as far as we're concerned. It's not a sledge, it's a bullet. It has recoil.

Would you divide by {(head plus piston crown) plus (area of cylinder
exposed at whatever point we're measuring at)} ? Probably maximum psi is at
maximum expansion/minimum chamber volume, wherever that is.
