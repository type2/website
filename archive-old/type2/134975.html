Subject: RE: tired--Vredestein vs. Hankook RA08

&gt; A few months ago I bought a pair of Vredestein Comtracs from
&gt; a non-bus-vendor before Bus Depot announced that they are
&gt; selling tires.  The regular Comtrac is a &quot;highway rib&quot; type
&gt; tire, not the &quot;Winter&quot; version Ron sells, and NOT M+S by any
&gt; means, in fact they slip and slide quite a bit just driving
&gt; on dry dirt roads (I expect the winters would be much better
&gt; for this).  But I was impressed at how beefy the Vredesteins
&gt; are, and they appear to have quite a bit of sidewall
&gt; reinforcement.  Ron, is there a reason you don't sell the
&gt; regular Vredestein Comtrac?
&gt;
&gt; Just last week I ordered a pair of the Hankook RA08's from
&gt; Bus Depot.  In comparison, the tire is not quite as beefy, a
&gt; little lighter, but looks like it will be better in the
&gt; mud/snow.  It does not appear to have as much sidewall
&gt; reinforcement/stiffness as the Vredestein Comtrac.  But it is
&gt; over $20 cheaper per tire.  I was highly tempted to go for a
&gt; pair of the Comtrac Winters but the price difference won me
&gt; over to the Hankooks.


The Vredestein Comtrac is a great tire.  If it were the same price as the
Hankook I'd have listed both. But considering the price difference, I like
the Hankook better than the non-snow version of the Comtrac. As you noted
it's a lot cheaper, and is better in snow/ice, which appeals to most people
(although even the Comtrac is better than some supposed &quot;all season&quot; tires).
And while the Hankook's sidewall may seem less stiff, in fact it has a
slightly higher capacity than the Comtrac's sidewall. (The Hankook is load
range D with a capacity of 1874 lbs; the Comtrac is load range C with 1800
lbs capacity; an insignificant difference but one that technically favors
the Hankooks.). So I don't see a downside to the Hankooks, despite the lower
price. Maybe the Comtracs would wear better, but then again they have the
same 11mm tread depth so I don't have any particular reason to expect them
to.  (And even if they did, they cost more so they should!)  So I opted to
list the Hankooks in this size. That said, I can get the Comtracs if someone
would like them.

I do list several other Comtracs on my website, both snows and not, in
versions or sizes where I think that tire is the best value. (While the
Hankook RA08 is a good tire, it's only available in 2 sizes and only in
all-season tread, so not everyone can use it.)  For example I list the
185R14 Comtrac Snow (as well as the 185/82R14 Vredestein Snowtrack), and
also non-snow 205R70 and 205/65R15 Comtracs for people who want a larger
tire and/or have larger wheels.

These tires (and others) can all be found at
&lt;http://busdepot_dot_com/busdepot/details/tires.jsp&gt; . If you want a tire not
listed there, email me and I can check on it.

&gt;

  I am monitoring this thread, because
&gt; eventually I need to get 2 more tires, maybe to make a
&gt; matching set of 4, but mainly for spares (the Alaska highway
&gt; is in my future, where 2 spares would be appropriate!).
&gt;
&gt; Slighty off topic, does anyone know where I might find a good
&gt; 165R15 tire for my '67 beetle?  I am in the Atlanta area. . .
&gt; or just pmail what brand you would recommend I should look
&gt; for, I know Kumho makes one in Euro Metric but hard to find. . .
&gt;
&gt; TIA,
&gt; Will A.
