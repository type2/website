give the FI a chance, have you got the VW Fuel injection trouble shooting
guide???   chances are that if you have done all you say you have to the
FI I would be inclined to look elsewhere.  and a carb isn't going to fix
that.  

does it not run, or you just can't get it right???

I remember responding to some of your previous posts, and really think the
problem is not in your FI system.
