Subject: Phantom oil leak

I have a couple of oil leaks in my '76. One of them is the standard 
'could be the oil cooler, the #4 pushrod tubes, or the oil filter 
bracket' leak. That was there when I took the carbs off and started 
putting the FI in. But now I have another leak that coats the fan shroud 
and all the rear tin in oil. At first, I thought it was the dipstick 
bellows, so I replaced that (and the old one broke in two when I pulled 
it out). But it does not seem to have made the difference. I suspect the 
blow-by problem, but I hope that's not it. The plastic tube on top of the 
filler tube is seated correctly, notches lined up, and clamped with the 
spring clamp. Is there anything else that could be causing this? (It 
doesn't happen at idle).

TIA
