Subject: Re: weber installation problems

Kevin,
	I installed the weber on my '74 with manual transmission. 
Here's the scoop:
	Remove old carbs and intake manifolds.
	You may or may not have the air pump thing. I did, and took 
it off. There was the problem of three or four tubes sticking up out 
of the heads, next to the intake manifolds. There have been 
discussions about how to plug these on this list, and the best way is 
to get large bolts that screw into them, but not too deep! Be sure to 
use loc-tight.
	I remember having to drill a new hole for my accelerator 
cable in the front tin.
	And since I had the dual vacuum advance, I needed another 
port on the intake manifold (not sure if you need one for the 
automatic tranny). Some people drill a small hole in the intake (with 
it OFF the bus) and braze/JBWeld a nipple onto it for a vacuum hose. 
I know you aren't supposed to do this, but I tapped into the brake 
booster vacuum hose (instead of puting a nipple on the manifold) and 
haven't had any problems at all.
	I think I ended up taking the jets and reversing them (taking 
the jet out of the small venturi and switching it with the one in the 
larger venturi), but I got my carb from Webber and since you got 
yours from the Bus Depot, they  may have your carb set up already for 
you so it runs well.
	It took me a while (a week or two) to get it running well, 
but since then, I have had NO problems whatsoever. I totally endorse 
those carbs.
	Good luck.
Joel '74  Westy
