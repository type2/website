Subject: Thanks Everybody!

Howdy. After that nasty business about my bus being vandalized, I had my faith
in humanity restored by the many kind offers of help from the list. Special
thanks to Don Boneau, who sent me a replacement set of lenses, and to everybody
else that made offers. I really do appreciate the community we have here. I
don't have a lot of parts, but if anybody ever needs help in the Raleigh, NC
area, drop me a line!
:)
Thanks again, and happy Friday!
