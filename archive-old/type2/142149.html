&gt; If I remember correctly (and please someone do correct me if I'm wrong,) the mounting holes
&gt;of the Vanagon Bearing Housing for the backing plate are reversed (upside down) from what the
&gt;71-79 Bus is

I remember Karl said he was going to fit Vanagon brakes onto his bus but I never heard back if he did or not.

I chased down some photos on the web:

I see three differences:

- there is an extra hole above the main one which probably doesn't matter on the bus (might have to close it over to prevent water getting in)

- the upper inspection hole has moved

- naturally, there are no holes for teh adjustment starts because they are self adjusting. This seems an easy modification to make in the home shop.
