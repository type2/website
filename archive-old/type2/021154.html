I looked into the website more to see what I could find out about FR12. 
  It sounds like pretty good stuff.  They say its not flammable either, 
which is one of the main things.  It doesn't require the higher 
pressures that R134a runs on either, which is a bonus.  I'd like to know 
some more of the cons to the product though.  Of course their website 
pushes the pros of it, but there has to be a downside.  I, personally, 
haven't used this yet but I think I will look into it in the future.  I 
mostly do work on newer cars, so a lot of my work is leak detecting, 
repairing the system, and then just recharging it.  I don't do any A/C 
system construction or anything like that.  Plus, we also have R12 left 
at work, so if someone comes in with an R12 system, we can still 
recharge it and not have to convert it.  But, when someone comes in with 
a problem with their A/C system, you can't just top it off and send them 
on their way.  Look at it like a flat tire.  When you get a flat tire do 
you just pump it up and go on your way?  No.  There is a reason that 
tire went flat, and you have to find it and fix it.  Same thing with AC 
systems.  Well, if you want it to last that is...

Sorry if I was rambling :)

&gt; Hi Isaiah,
&gt; 
&gt; It sounds like you've done a good bit of AC work. 
&gt; There's supposed to be a drop in replacement for R12
&gt; which is called FR12 (FrigC) and made by Intercool. 
&gt; Their web site is &lt;www.igc_dot_com/intercool&gt;.  Do you
&gt; think this stuff will work as a replacement for R12? 
&gt; Permanent conversion from R12 involves adding 2 oz of
&gt; ester oil, and charging with the FR12 blend in liquid
&gt; mode.  One of the components of the blend is R134A.
