Subject: torn headliner

My old '69 has about fifty tears, large and small, in the headliner.  I'm doing
a general fixup/restoration but don't want to buy a new headliner (or learn to
install one)  Has  anyone had any experience  with stitching up or otherwise
repairing such tears...John Jensen in Annapolis
