&gt; Does anyone know if the ball joints for a 68 would fit in a 66???  I think
they would, but I wanted to check with all of you experts out there, and
make sure before I sold something that won't work.  Thanks volks, enjoy your
Wed.!!!

&gt; Would these fit a 1966??? Seems to me they would. I dont think the front
&gt; end changed until 1970.
&gt;
&gt; How much are you lookin to get for them??
