Subject: battery drain

the reason that I think it was the ignition is
because i would walk out and for some reason the
lights on the dash would be on..........so after
smacking the ignition a couple times it went
off, but I dont think that is the entire
problem.............so thus changing the
ignition........and I was
going to change the voltage regulator because ive had
this problem on other cars and that was what it
was.......so i figured id try........
