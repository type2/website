Subject: Re: [T2] Tires - was Discount Tires (and Snows!) for Busses

Here we go again! 


The term LOAD RANGE and then a letter ONLY refers to
the PLY rating, NOT the MAX LOAD the tire can carry in
lbs.!!!!!

There was a whole giant discussion on this not more
than 6 months ago...........

 My question is that if one get &quot;C&quot; rated tires that
 have a load rating that
 is more than  1/2 the weight at the read axle - is
 that OK?
