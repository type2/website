&gt; This is getting way off the subject that John

&gt; on......Can we kill this thread?

True!! There have been so many answers that I forgot
the original question ;^) Actually, Brother Snoopy
gave me the EXACT information I was looking for. After
conversing back and forth with him a few times
yesterday, I found everything I needed and about
midnite last night I already had the auxillary battery
all hooked and confirmed that it was charging when the
engine was running. Tonight I am going to run the
auxillary power output and hook up a TV to it and sit
for about 3 hours watching the Andy Griffith show just
to see if I do indeed turn into a slobbering moron as
suggested. Next step will be hooking up the gas heater
to the system. Although back in the day we didn't need
no gas heaters, we drove thru negative 20 degree
temperatures in our underwear and we didn't need no
sissy heater, not like the kids today ;^)
In all seriousness, take a good hard look at the &quot;good
old days&quot; and I think you'll realize that the good old
days are more OLD than GOOD!
And just because we were all morons as kids and didn't
need anything more than a piece of string and a dead
fly to entertain ourselves for hours, doesn't mean we
should expose our kids to the same!
