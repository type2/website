Chris,

Next time the brakes are pulsing, pull over and carefully feel of the front
brake lines. If they feel hot, then what you're experiencing may be that the
calipers are not springing back, and they're heating the brake fluid, which
in turn causes more pressure in the system. Just a thought.

When I first drug my '72 Riviera out of the junkyard in Little Rock, I had a
similar problem due to rusted-in-place calipers. This was towing the bus
behind a car and I could tell that the discs were getting hot...and that the
brakes were applying themselves more. I pulled over at a station with a big
parking lot, donned my welding gloves (I carry these with me on every
trip--to deal with hot things), crawled under the bus, and opened the
bleeder valve on the passenger side. The steam and hot fluid from the lines
was overwhelming (and would have been dangerous, had I not been SUPER
careful; hot oil burns deep!).

Just an idea.

Good luck! Joe
