Subject: re: [T2] Wood interior for the Westy - long, sorry

&gt;I would describe the material covering my '78 Westy's cabinets as Formica. 
&gt;Are you saying you strip the color or pattern off of the Formica (if it is 
&gt;that) and leave the Formica in place?

No, no, and no.  I was talking about the paneling, not the cabinets..

Specifically, the paneling that fits the sliding door, the section aft of 
the sliding door, the horizontal strips over both sides of the rear (over 
the engine compartment), the rear hatch/door, the pieces behind our 2 piece 
cabinet and over our large sink cabinet.

For the '72 and '73, there would also be the ceiling peices and around the 
pop top opening and the roof over the driver/passenger head.  For us, these 
areas are covered with white (NLA) vinyl.

I have a cabinet door front which is starting to separate from the door 
itself, and this appears to me like formica.  I was planning to slip some 
Elmer's Wood glue under there with a butter knife and press it on solid, but 
it is plain and easy to see the formica type material on the cabinets.



&gt;So you are saying that acetone will dissolve or release the glue of the old 
&gt;Formica?


Sorry, I don't think it is going to be that easy to get the formica off...
