Subject: Re:  Fridge questions...

Type 2ers:

Just throwing my (type) 2 cents into the 'who wants my fridge' thread...

I recently acquired a fridge/sink assembly from a '71 Westy and was also
wondering if the fridge worked or if it just took a long time to cool. 
It's not a Dometic, I can't remember who makes it.  Anyway, it looks
like you could take any small fridge (i.e. Dorm/apartment fridge) and
wedge it in the cabinet, cut off the plug, and hook it up to the AC/DC
inverter inside the cabinet.  The fridge I had when I was a freshman had
no problem freezing a case of beer after i forgot about it. :(

It was a pain to get this fridge out of the cabinet but not impossible. 
Depending on what I do with this cabinet I may try this conversion and
let everyone know what happens.  I may decide it's too much of a pain to
try and integrate the '71 sink into my '67 camper.  It doesn't exactly
jive with the interior of the bus (non-walkthrough).  Oh well, maybe
I'll have to get a loaf (hint).
