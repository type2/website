(Warning: The following &quot;joke&quot; was shamelessly adapted/stolen from an old
Flip Wilson skit and reformatted for a VW audience--Now that I re-read it it
might not be THAT funny, but I bet if Flip told it it would get a laugh!) :)

Coincidentally, many of the men in my old army unit had nicely restored
volkswagens waiting for them at home.  We'd spend hours in the barracks
talking about restoration techniques and hunting down vintage parts for
barndoors.  Occasionally some of us would get a bad news call from home that
our prized bus had been damaged.  When this happened, our CO (also a big VW
nut) assigned Private Jones to deliver the bad news to the men. On the first
morning of Private Jones' assignment, the CO recieved a call that Corporal
Smith's '55 deluxe was destroyed by an engine fire when his wife had taken
it out that morning.  The CO passed the information to the Private to
deliver the news to Smith.  Private Jones promptly went over to the PA
system and announced, &quot;Attention Company B:  Corporal Smith, Your '55 just
burned to the ground!&quot;

Smith, on hearing the news collapsed and was rushed to the infirmary.  The
CO stormed into the office and said &quot;Jones, what the hell are you doing?!!&quot;  

Jones replied, &quot;I'm just giving the news to the Corporal like you said.&quot;

The CO lashed out at Jones and said these matters have to be handled
delicately and further derided Jones for his incompetence.  &quot;Now the next
time I give you this assignment I want you to handle it tactfully!&quot;

&quot;Yessir!&quot; said Jones sheepishly.

A few weeks later, the CO received another call that Private Adams' '54
kombi had fallen off a trailer as his brother was taking it to a show, and
was hit head-on by a 18-wheeler traveling in the opposite direction.  The CO
ordered Jones to deliver the news.

Jones promptly went over to the PA, and began broadcasting, &quot;Attention
Company B: Everyone with a mint condition barndoor bus take one step
forward--Adams, be cool...!&quot;
