Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Swap Info?

&gt; I won't wave at watercooled transporters in the future because I know I
&gt; won't get a wave back: the other driver will have to put down his cell
&gt; phone first, and by then they'll have zipped by me.

Must be a West Coast thing.  I even get Eurovan/ Rialta drivers in town to
wave at me all the time.  Maybe I just look friendlier than you. Who knows.
I do live in one of the friendliest cities in America.  Charleston, SC.
(We've won that award somehow a few times)

Peace to all VW Bus Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
