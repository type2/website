Subject: Type4 Engine

As the happy owner of a '71 Camper Van (The Hobbit) I have a
Type4 1800cc engine that is just taking up space in my garage.
It is just a long block and anyone who wants or needs it can have
it.  I would really like to trade for something of worth that I could
use, such as a spare part for my '71 (carb, dizzy, etc), 
or for an engine stand or a doghouse fan shroud.  If no one has
anything to trade, then I will just give it to whomever can come 
and pick it up.  I will not try to ship it.  I got the engine when I 
purchased a '73 Westfalia from a friend.  He said it was in good
condition at the time I got it, but it has been sitting in my garage 
for about 4 years now.  I am in Apex, NC (about 15 miles SW of
Raleigh).

'71 Hardtop (not a pop-top) camper van, The Hobbit.
