Subject: regulator wires reversed.

I had a mechanic other than my usual VW mech install a new clutch for 
me in my 77 Riveria, and noticed the next two days that I had to jump 
the battery to get the van started and that the alternator light would 
not come on.  I suspected a battery fault when the battery would only 
charge to 60%.  I limped it over to my usual mechanic and he noticed 
that the blue and black wires to the regulator were switched.  Once 
plugged in to the correct place, the indicator lights worked, and it 
started right up.

After driving to the other mechanic, and having them put a copy of the 
diagnosis in to their file I started wondering about the battery again. 
  I hooked up the charger to it and now it will charge up all the way.

The van started fine this morning so I can tell that the alternator is 
still charging.  Should I be expecting the regulator and alternator to 
fail soon though since it was wired in wrong?

Thanks,
Gary
