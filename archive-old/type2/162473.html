&gt; After having refused to do another run of the Koni Bus shocks for us, Koni
&gt; has reversed their position (at least for now). After their previous
&gt; waffling, I decided I'd better not say anything until they were actually in
&gt; hand, just in case they reversed their position again. But sure enough, the
&gt; shocks just showed up!

I got a complete set from the first buy and they are worth twice the
price.   my bus has never handled so well....  if I have to get rid of my
bus I think the shocks will be taken off before anything else and stored
for my next bus.   they are that good!
