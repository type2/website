Subject: Missing exhaust studs

Could not find much info in the archives for my question and I thought I sent
this post Sunday but didn't see it show up + I did some parts calls this AM
which prompted some new questions.

I am working on replacing 3 missing exhaust studs (the ones holding the
exhaust manifold to the bottom of the head) on my 75 Camper. I thought my plan
of action was to tap the hole in the head to 9 or 10mm and use a stepped stud
because I assumed the hole was stripped since an 8mm bolt would not tighten up
in any of the 3 holes.

The local VW parts guy says that the OEM stud is already stepped with the hole
end being 9mm. Three questions:

1. Is there much chance that the 3 studs loosened and fell out and a new 9mm
bolt would tighten in their place? (wishful thinking?)

2. Do I need to tap to 10mm and try to find a stepped stud long enough to
work?

3. Do I need to remove muffler, heat exchangers and exhaust manifolds and put
a helicoil in the stripped holes and go back to OEM studs, and if so, what
size helicoil and can I do this repair with engine in bus?

Or is there another easier/harder course of action?

A followup question, the PO had an import shop fix a fuel leak which they did
by replacing most of the fuel lines. Only problem is they used what looks like
black American fuel lines. Do I need to replace with the black reinforced
hoses I bought from RMMW?
