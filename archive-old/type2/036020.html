Hey Joe,

I used to have Britcars that would do that!  A question...  When you
turn the key off does the alt idiot light immediately come on?  If so,
like the Britcars, you need a alternator voltage regulator. (Or you
could pull the old one off, open it up and file the points in it.)  The
cut-out relay is sticking.
