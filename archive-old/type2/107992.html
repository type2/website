Subject: Re: [T2] burned exhaust valves

This is complete and utter BS and if the quote is correct then my opinion of
the &quot;certain rebuilder in Sacramento&quot; has gone way, way down.  I, too had my
heads rebuilt by that &quot;certain rebuilder in Sacramento&quot; and spent quite a
lot of time in the shop when I dropped off the heads, just talking to the
owner of the company.  Neither during the conversation at the drop off nor
at the time that I picked up the heads was the orthodoxy of &quot;only one turn&quot;
past contact ever brought up.

You may, in fact, be the problem here, with a too-lean mixture or
way-advanced timing, but if the shop is going to hide behind an unpublished
&quot;standard&quot; then I'd fight them all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Please let us know how this all plays out since, up to now, the opinion has
been that the &quot;certain rebuilder in Sacramento&quot; has been more than fair in
their treatment of their customers.

Subject: [T2] burned exhaust valves


&gt; Since replacing the heads on my
&gt; '79 Westy
&gt; [snip]
&gt; The test showed
&gt; something like 80% (!) leakage, so I had the mechanic pull the heads to
&gt; check them.  Sure enough, solvent leaked right out.
&gt;
&gt; So, the heads were just barely still under warranty from a certain
&gt; rebuilder in Sacramento.  The company has always been helpful and they
&gt; asked me to send the heads back.  Today, I got a call from the company,
&gt; as it turns out, the exhaust valves were all burnt.  I was asked how I
&gt; had the valves/lifters adjusted and I replied, &quot;2 full turns past zero
&gt; lash, just as Bently instructs for the hydraulics.&quot;  I was told that I
&gt; should have adjusted the valves to one turn, as 2 turns &quot;will almost
&gt; certainly cause this condition to happen.&quot;  The company said it could do
&gt; the repair work... for $100/head!  Grrr... After some discussion, I got
&gt; them to lower the price a bit.  My beef was: the company never
&gt; instructed me to do this!  They claim that I should &quot;just know&quot;!
