Hi Don,

For $25 I'd definitely recommend you replace the coil. Mine packed it  
in on the way to the Outer Banks on Easter Monday. It started as an  
occaisional hiccup and got a lot less occasional within a couple  
hundred miles. Problem was that the bus ran PERFECTLY at idle, so I  
could not nail the problem down to a specific cylinder. Eventually it  
got bad enough that something &quot;had to be done&quot;, so I pulled into an  
Advance Auto and within 12 minutes I was back on the road problem- 
free. This was a lesson I learned on the way to EveryBus 2001, when  
it happened to Jeff Stewart going through Lynchburg VA.


Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; My misfire has grown exponentially.
&gt;
&gt; So far I've ruled out the distributor (p&amp;c replaced, checked cap  
&gt; for cracks,
&gt; etc), wires, and fuel filter.
&gt; I've been considering grounding one plug wire at a time and trying  
&gt; to drive
&gt; hoping to isolate the misfiring cylinder to reduce my time under  
&gt; there. Any
&gt; thoughts or suggestions on a good grounding method? I've been  
&gt; looking at my
&gt; clip on spark tester thinking it might do the trick.
