Subject: Fri--What is it with the dead?

&gt; Does anyone have a bmp or jpg of the following?:  Buses go around a circle
&gt; and on the inside the VW is made of bones.

I just missed the early rock and roll scene.  I'm actually old enough, but
my parents were too old to like rock and roll, so I never quite got it.  So
what is interesting about the greatful dead, and what is their connection to
busses?  Is the name &quot;greatful dead&quot; a literary reference?  What is the
particular significance of death and death imagery?  What are they greatful
for?

Pardon my pedantry.  I have only come here seeking knowledge; things they
would not teach me of in college.

Regards,

Grant
