Our 1972 Dormobile had another layer of patterned sheet metal covering the
under body from aft of the beam to the tranny. Great for cleaning mud off
from but would be interesting if anything silly happened with clutch/e-brake
cables or wiring/brake fluid lines. 
We had to replace all this stuff and some of the chassis as the dreaded rust
had been incubating in there for a few years. A PO had just covered up the
holes after use on salted roads in England. B*stard.
I briefly regretted that poke with the screwdriver which unveiled all this
mess but wouldn't have slept well if I'd left it unattended, and it's now as
smooth as a baby's....
