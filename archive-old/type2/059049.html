I just read the post regarding one person removal of the engine.

A few months ago, I found a very easy way of removing and installing the
engine and transmission as a unit in a Type 4 powered Bus.  I used a 2 foot by
3 foot (approximately) board (a four wheeled furniture dolly you might
say) with big casters at each corner. I rolled
the engine and trans underneath the bus which was supported by steel ramps
under the rear wheels, and then slowly and carefully jacked it up
using TWO jacks, one at the rear one at the front. As I jacked it up, I
continuously stacked wood blocks under the dolly at each corner so that if the
engine/trans/dolly were to tip off the jacks, it wouldnt go to far.  The rear
one was a moderatly cheap floor jack like they got at Sears, the front was a
super cheap floor jack like they
got for 19.99 at Target.  This allows for the whole thing to be nudged a bit
into position.

I later removed the engine and trans by jacking the dolly up to it,
removing the bolts and then lowering the whole thing, while unstacking the
blocks at each corner used to reduce the possiblility of the whole thing 
crashing down.

It all worked very nicely, and allowed me to avoid costly medical bills.

Do to the danger involved of dropping 300 or so pounds of metal on yourself I
feel I
must add my
Disclaimer:  Although the above worked for me, it may totally fail for you
causing very serious injury or worse, so
try this at your own risk or safer yet, do not do it at all.
