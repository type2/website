Look for a small notch in the rear crank pulley (should be on the  engine
side of the pulley.) Line this up with 0 degrees on your advance gauge
which would be mounted to the rear of your motor.    You need to see if # 1
valves are both closed and  the intake valve has just closed (so you don't
get # 3 TDC instead)

Have fun

&gt;How do I get piston#1 to firing position at TDC?  I could do it if the
&gt;distributer was in, but I am reinstalling it after a rebuild and need to get
&gt;it setup right. The fan marks dont help either as it was painted.   All the
&gt;manuals say to get #1 to TDC and then install tthe dizzy, but they dont tell
&gt;me how to get to TDC in the first place.  I need help soon! TIA
