Subject: Can't Get It To Run Right

74 Van, Engine # EAS600703, apparently a 1.7L 914 engine with a Holley carb
 
I wasn't convinced that I had TDC figured out so I made sure the rotor was coming around to the #1 spark plug wire terminal then used a screwdriver in the spark plug hole to figure out when the piston was at it's highest point.  I checked the valves on #1 and they were both closed.  This point seemed to be about 1cm to the left of the V notch on the pulley, is that possible?  Or should I use the notch as my TDC point?  Anyway, I got the Dwell angle to 50 degrees then tried to set my timing to 27 degrees.  I can get it to run at this setting but not very well.  If I want to get the rpms up from an idle I have to feather the gas or it will die trying .  If I turn the distributor to the right I can get the engine to run much better but then the timing goes off the scale when I rev the engine!  Anybody have any ideas?
