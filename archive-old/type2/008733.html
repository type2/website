Okay listees, this is a Friday survey:

What is, in your opinion, the most useful, indespensible, 'changed your
life after you started using it' tool, for working on VW Campers? It
doesn't have to be big, expensive, complicated or hard-to-find. Just the
tool that is 'brilliant'.

As well as the fun element, this could prove useful to the amateur VW
mechanic just starting out, and also to the seasoned mechanics who have a
wide range of tools and are looking for more to add to the collection.

I'll start the ball rolling with:      thin-nosed pliers.

Usual survey stuff, which (I think) is pmail me and I'll compile a result
for the weekend. Or if its listworthy, you know where to post it :+)
