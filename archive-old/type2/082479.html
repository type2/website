Subject: A Sort of Homecoming (for real)

List,
Well - there sits in my back yard the 74 bus that i had sold to a local k=
id
last summer.

While he had it, he had Major Brands put rear shoes and cylinders on it a=
nd
cleaned up some electrical connections...and someone swiped the heater co=
ntrol
boxes for some reason...

I was happy as a pig in sh!t saturday in 68 degree sunshine replacing the=

rusted out crossover pipe with a good one i picked up on ebay for $5.

I want to thank everyone who bought stuff from me in my fund raising atte=
mpt.

I still have a couple of items packed and ready to ship that the buyers b=
acked
out on. They are a nice, yellow-ish rear engine hatch from a 71 bus and a=

clean steering wheel from a 78.
I want $50 for the hatch and $25 for the steering wheel.
I'd trade both for a new (or really nice) set of flapper boxes.

thanks again,

Clark Gordon
Morehead, ky.
