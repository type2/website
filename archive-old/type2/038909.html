Subject: Gauge Fogging Problem

Hey Folks, I've got the standard Holy Trinity of VDO gauges ( oil press, oil 
temp. and volts) on my dash in a VDO three hole pod, plus a VDO tach to the 
right of the speedo. When the temp is moderate, and the humidity is high, I 
get some serious fogging. Is this happening to anyone else, and does anybody 
have a cure? Kind of a PITA.
Thanks!
