It seams that VW Busses from England do not have a vent window as I have
seen a few English busses and have yet to see one with vent windows.  A
Dormobile has no windows anywhere but the roll down ones in front and the
Dormobile top windows and you can't drive with them open for fear of blowing
them off at $75 bucks a window or pulling into something and ripping them
off

&gt; &gt; 1. The vent windows in the front doors, do not open.  I mean they have
no
&gt; &gt; latch and the rubber completely seals them in.
&gt;
&gt; I've seen pix of this on dealer lit from the 68-70 years.  Interesting.
&gt; Bummer, too, as vent wings are excellent ways to cool off from summer
&gt; heat.
