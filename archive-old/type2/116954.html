Subject: Classic T-Shirts

Hi Volks,

I recently ran into a guy I used to see vending t-shirts on tour a few years
back and asked him if he had any VW Bus related designs.  He showed me the 2
designs he had and offered to sell me the whole lot at a pretty good price.
Needless to say, I am now in possession of 18pcs of the Crying Splitty
(Jerry Garcia memorial), and 22pcs of the VW Steal Your Face (Grateful Dead)
design.  I have some on grey shirts, and some on natural (unbleached) 100%
cotton.  These shirts are all in adult sizes Large &amp; Extra-Large.  If anyone
is interested in getting one, let me know and I can send a pics.  I would
like to get $10.00 ea for the shirt + $4.00 for shipping by Priority Mail.
I think that 2 shirts could ship for the same price as one.  If there are
any left over, I should have them with me at Transporters By The Tunnel next
weekend.
