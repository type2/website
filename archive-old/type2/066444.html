Subject: Picking up the Pick Up

Howdy all. After a day of recovery, I thought I'd relate the tale of the great
Alabama bus retrieval (I shan't call it a rescue).
 As a background, I and my friend and girlfriend were planning to drive his '71
Double Cab some 600 miles to Alabama, to get Uncle Joel's 68 Crew Cab, which I
had ogled last summer.
 We planned to leave Friday morning, but you know how things dealing with Vw's
and VW people tend to have schedules of their own... Anyway, we ended up
leaving Raleigh at 3:30, which we all knew meant we were in for a late trip.
However, even with several coffee stops, we still made it in right around 12
hours. We set up the tent in 40 degree darkness, to the sweet sounds of dogs
barking.
 Actually, Joel's and Dave's reports pretty much summed up the rest of the
trip, except for the blessedly uneventful return trip.
The only excitement we had was to witness a car fire.Let me just insert my
warning to always carry an extinguisher, and also always check your fuel
system. Apparently the fellow had been having a leaky injector, which had just
caught fire before we pulled over. Alas, it was still too late. Sean discharged
his extinguisher, but the fire had already spread. We ahd to stand around as
the whole care quickly went up in flames, even bursting the tires. Luckily,
though, the fire department put it out before the gas tank blew up. It did
gnarl up traffic for a while, though. Anyway, we returned home around 11:00
Sunday night, safe and sound. Yesterday, I got a new battery, and begun the
hunt for the '68 flasher and turn signal relay...
Anyway, Many thanks to Joel and Dave for putting us up for the night. I will
say again that almost every bus person I've met has been super-hospitable, and
great people in general. If anyone is ever in raleigh, NC, and needs a place,
just let me know...
Anyway, THe rest of the t-shirts should be out this week....
HAppy Tuesday,. and enjoy those busses!
