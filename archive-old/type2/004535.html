Subject: NAPA Air Shocks

Just got the NAPA (#MA758) air shocks for my 78 Bus to quick fix my saggy
rear end. The problem is the stock bolts are about 10mm too short. The top
stock bolt is lone enough for the bottom so I really just need a new longer
bolt for the top.
I spent 2 hours checking every source in town, even a bolt specialty store-
no go.  I was informed I need a 12mm bolt that has a 1.5 thread and is 110mm
long. Does anyone know where I can get a couple of these?
Thanks a bunch.
