Subject: And now with less power!

I did my first 100 mile break-in tune up on my '70's new, but bone-stock,
1600 dp motor. It now runs smoother with less noise and the torque curve is
more linear. However, It now has noticeably less power which is odd.

 

Steps I did.

 

Adjusted the valves to .006 and rechecked them twice

Changed the oil with Castrol 10-40w (20-50w is too thick for this winter)

Cleaned the filter screen

Changed the stock oil-bath air filter oil with 10-30w

Checked (but did not adjust) the timing at 28 degrees total advance at 3000
rpm.

 

The only noticeable difference between before and after tune was the oil was
low in the oil-bath air filter before the change.

 

Will having the correct amount of oil in the filter restrict air flow and
cause these symptoms?
