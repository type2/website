Subject: Re: [T2] There were NEVER any factory ragtop buses

I think I'll agree that convertible is supposed to be the only &quot;ragtop&quot;, but
when you have companies out there marketing their cloth-type sunroofs as a
&quot;ragtop&quot; what can you do?  I think that only started because people had a
similar gripe about what IS a sunroof and what IS NOT a sunroof.  I can see
the discussion on some other group:
&quot;If it is not a retracting part of a complete roof by some weather
protective material such as glass or metal, then it is not a sunroof&quot; or
whatever the heck that may say.  I say, you knew what I was talking about
when I said I might want to convert to it, right?   By a show of hands, who
thought I meant making my bus a full convertible ('vert)?

&gt; My quest is to sow enough linguistic doubt that next time you hear someone
say &quot;Dude! Did you see that slammed ragtop?&quot; you'll go, &quot;Uh, is that a...?&quot;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Remember &quot;it's a Volkswagen not a car&quot;.
