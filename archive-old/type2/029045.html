I have had good luck with the plastic ones, the markings don't rub off.  I
have seen a few break though.  What has worked best for me is to use a
plastic one as a guide to engrave marks into the metal one.

Hi,

I have a 1979 2.0 litre motor in the 1972 bus and it does not have a
timing scale. I am assuming 1979 motors had them. I have heard
nothing but bad things about the cheap plastic aftermarket ones so if
anyone has a stock one sitting around let me know.

Thanks
