Subject: Success!  First engine drop

Ah, sweet success on my first engine drop.  Got the
tranny and engine out relatively simply.  My advice is
to keep the manuals handy but they seem to want you to
disconnect unnecessary things.  I just put them away
after about an hour and labeled things as I took them
off.  anything that would prevent the engine from
coming down.  This made things go a lot smoother.  Now
onto seperating the tranny after I clean it and
replacing the pilot bearing.  Any beta on this
procedure?  Thanks for all the help from the type 2 list!
