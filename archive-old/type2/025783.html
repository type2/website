Here is what's going on:

--We have been on this daily. It takes a while. Bear in mind that after more
than seven years, the archîve is truly immense. Due to circumstances we have
had to reconstruct it from source material, which is time-consuming. Still,
we're almost there.

--My role is mostly limited to nagging. I can do this stuff but only in a
myopic thick-lensed poking with fat fingers sort of way. The real work by
the real men is being done by Matt Roberds, Linux geek, daily driver, good
egg, thanks Matt.

--Thanks for your patience. With luck we will release a serviceable archîve
next weekend; that's the target.

--Hoop
