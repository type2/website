Subject: painted hubcaps-'69

        I've got some 69 or 70 factory literature in French which shows
commercial vehicles- single and double cabs, panel vans and I
think a Limosine version (??) and the working T2s are shown
with medium grey, not chrome, hubcaps. Cheaper than chrome. 
        Pages 26 and 29 in Laurence Meredith's book show similar
hubcaps in what are probably factory promo shots too. Post '71 busses
with disk brakes and flattened hub-caps are also shown with painted
hubcaps, mostly 'silver' paint (clearly not chrome- not shiny OR
smooth) but some a light color- white or off-white.
