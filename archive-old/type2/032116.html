Hi, folks:

On Wed, 17 Mar 1999, I myself wrote:

&gt; The gearshift lever seems to have a lot more side-to-side play
&gt; in my hand, and at the same time it's become harder to &quot;find&quot; reverse,
&gt; 1st, and 2nd.  It doesn't have to be forced, I just have to hunt around
&gt; very carefully to find the gear. 

Thanks to those who offered advice.

Ron Van Ness, Dave Russell, and David Brodbeck each nailed it in one--the
coupling on the front of the transmission that links to the rear shift rod
has come apart. The rubber insert on the side opposite the hex screw is
gone, though the rolled pin is still there, and the metal housing looks
otherwise undamaged, and the bellows and bushings on the shift rod look
okay.

And David B added this comment:

&gt; Replacement is annoying, and oily if your
&gt; tranny oozes like mine, but not too complicated.

Now, if I read my Bentley right, which is always at least open to
discussion, it sounds as if the tranny will have to come out, then the
rear half of the shift rod, before the flexible coupler can be replaced on
the shift rod.  Is that right?  [If so, I'm a little in awe of David B.
for his calm, Gary Cooper-esque sense of what counts as &quot;not too
complicated!&quot;]

Any advice on this last detail would be appreciated--can the coupler be
replaced without pulling the tranny? [Tranny in, I can do it; tranny out,
I'll have to take it to a garage.] Thanks.

p.s. Honorable mention to Andy Pechenik, who suggested looking at the 
linkage at the front end of the shift rod.  That all seemed to check out
okay.

p.p.s. Gran Prix goes to Ulf Nyman, who happened to guess completely wrong
this one time, but nevertheless offered my kind of advice: First check to
see if it's a really cheap part in a convenient location that you can fix
with simple tools.  I used to play golf with a fellow who, whenever he
lost his ball, no matter where on the course he was, would go look in the
hole to see if the ball had somehow ended up there.  Didn't have a high
success rate with the technique, but I had to admire his attitude.
