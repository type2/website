Subject: Re: [T2] Linnoleum and pop top Q:

&gt;  Does anyone know if there's a way to save the linoleum and reinstall 
&gt; it afterwards?  Is that just an insane idea?

Not insane at all. The flooring is attached to a sheet of plywood. If 
you remove all the camper parts, you should be able to pull the whole 
floor up and out.

&gt;   Any thoughts on how to safely clean this area, and on any products 
&gt; or other procedures you recommend?

Use a spray bottle with diluted bleach. Scrub. Rinse


&gt; 3. What's best (durable and aesthetic) route to repairing the hole in 
&gt; the yellow part?

There are people who can reweave any cloth, but you would have to take 
the canvas off. If you are only interested in how the repair looks from 
the outside, you'd do best to use an iron-on patch on the inside. Have 
someone stand on the inside with the patch taped to a piece of wood, 
with the glue facing the repair. You will be on the outside with an 
iron (no steam). Bring the torn parts together as closely as you can 
and iron until the glue bonds. Then, for a first rate repair, put in a 
stitch with stout thread of matching color, crossing back and forth 
across the tear. It will look like a repair, but that's a badge of 
honor. Most people will never notice it.
