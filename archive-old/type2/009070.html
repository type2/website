&gt; I have pulled my engine on my 68' because my clutch started making an
&gt; awful sound when depressed.
&gt; I think I need to replace the throwout mechanism because it seems to
be
&gt; off center. The throwout bearing itself
&gt; has straight lines across it as though someone took a ruler and
&gt; scratched fine parallel lines all across it. The other
&gt; suspect component is the pressure plate which I haven't ever
replaced.(
&gt; I've replaced the clutch disk twice.)
&gt; My pedal has always been abnormally hard to push down and I want to
fix
&gt; it!!!!!!
&gt; As it stands I'm going to replace the whole system throwout lever,
&gt; bearing, and possibly put in a
&gt; diaphram clutch as opposed to the pressure plate. Any comments are
&gt; welcome.

Definitely replace the throwout bearing if it has been run off-center.
 I didn't and had to pull the engine again within a month.

Replacing the throwout fork is also a good idea, as most original ones
are very worn around the area where the throwout bearing pivots.  Make
sure that the forks are securely welded to the shaft all around the
base of the fork.  The spot welds tend to come apart.

Also, replace the shaft bushing and the snap rings that hold the shaft
in place.  I'm willing to be that the snap ring on the inside face of
the bushing has slipped out of its slot, causing your problem.  I
always use a new snap ring and use fine safety wire to make sure that
it cannot open and slide along the shaft.  You have to file a small
relief notch in the thrust washer to allow clearance for the safety
wire.

Unless you old pressure plate is damaged, there's no reason to replace
it.  They last a long time.  You really don't need a &quot;high pressure&quot;
plate as the power of your engine can't overpower the stock design.
