Subject: [T2] Ac compressor on a Type iV 2L?

Dear all,

I would like to put a compresor in the back of my 1979 2L to use as 
an air compressor.
I have heared that a &quot;york&quot; would be good. Has anyone got an AC system on a 2L?
WHere does the extra pulley go? Alternator or fan?
Any input welcome including parts and pictures.
Thanks,

Lukas

PS: Want to be able to pump the tires on the move after driving in 
sand, in case you are wondering...
