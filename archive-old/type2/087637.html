&gt;&quot;And another thing to this entire thread, no way, no how, you will clean a
tank as well as getting it done at the local radiator shop.  My local
radiator shop wants $40, calculate very closely your time, money in
chemicals, and effort, let alone the
&gt;friggin hassle of it.  They want about another $50 to coat afterwards, and
I'd be inclined to let them do that as well.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;If people are really doing it for 40$ still, it's the obvious way to go.
Thanks to all, I'm now in the know.

Well I do admit I think Dolan paid quite a bit more in DC to have
his '67 tank boiled out.  So are the advantages of living in BFN
west by god virginia.  I haven't had one done in two years either
but $70-$90 was the going rate to boil out and coat at that time,
depending on size and who you had do it, there are about 4 shops
around me the one I went with for $90 I had had good luck with
before so I went with them again.  Sometimes big cities are actually
cheaper though, all depends, call around.

John
