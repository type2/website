This is REALLY type 2 bus content, so please don't
get angry....

Harbor Freight is selling a torque wrench, a click
stop, a 1/2&quot; drive ratchet head, and pretty decent
quality.  It goes from 0 - 150 ft lb..

It is on special NOW for half price, just shy of
ten bucks!!!

I bought one for $20 a while back and I use it
every time I put my wheels on....  And two weeks
ago I went for the 0-80 ft lb 3/8 drive click stop
ratchet for the close in work, like CV bolts,
rocker arm nuts, etc...  It was $12 then, but the
3/8&quot; 0-80 torque is back to normal.

BTW, I went to four junk yards, and I did not find
my  '76-'81 Manual Trans starter/solenoid.  I DID
take home a rear hatch Westy bug screen  (in
excellent condition)  a '80 Vanagon camper
supplement (clean and pretty) and a few (3 - all
extras, but I couldn't pass them up!!) voltage
regulators.  

There was a fairly nice automatic trans starter/
solenoid, but the yard man wanted $35, and I did
not need it.  I left it..  I can go back for it,
if anyone need this kind of starter.  For $35, J.
R. will take it off the '78 bus. 

So, anybody out there want to help out??  I am
still looking for a 'clear' (my starter casing is
rusted thin, and I am afraid if I take it apart, I
will mess it up so bad that I would not be able to
get it back in ny kind of shape.)
