Subject: Re: '69 electrical (brake/turnsignal light) problem

Chuck,

Thanks for the reply. I read the test method you
mentioned in Muir, but it didn't say to short both
units to one another....it said to short *one* unit by
jumping the two pins. 

The problem is...there are *3* pins on *each* of my
*two* switches!!! Now, Muir *did* say that if I had 2
switches, that I'd have to check them both.... Still,
he doesn't say *which* of the 3 pins to short! 

Does it matter which pins (spade connectors, sorry) I
short??? I would certainly think so, but maybe not.

My spade connectors look like this:

      |_|   |_|  
So which connectors do I short to which????

If it is the switch, that's a good thing; I already
have a new spare. 

However, the fact that the turn-signal is out on that
side as well, but the emergency flashers *do* work,
leads me to believe the problem may be in the relay
(turn-signal, not emergency).... Perhaps it's both the
relay and the brake-switch?!!!! :-(


Thanks again!

&gt; take a screwdriver and short across both brake
&gt; switches it is possible for 
&gt; one to be bad and they work diferent sides. Your
&gt; tail light works because its 
&gt; on a different circuit so that really dosn't mean
&gt; anything. The left side is 
&gt; piggybacked off the right side meaning power comes
&gt; from the right side so a 
&gt; good guess is either, bad bulb (remember it has 2
&gt; elements), bad brake light 
&gt; switch, or a broken lead where it t's to feed the
&gt; left side. I would start at 
&gt; the brake switch, if you cross it and get light
&gt; you've solved the problem.
