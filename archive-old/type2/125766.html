Subject: Steering box adjustments

Hi All,

I wrote a while back about some steering issues I was having with really sloppy
steering.

I've since had both upper and lower ball-joints replaced. The tie rod ends look
old but not completely wasted. And the swing lever arm does NOT move up and down
when the steering wheel is turned.

So, I begun to adjust the steering box. Now this makes the steering wheel feel
much tighter (not as easy to turn the steering wheel) but the amount of play
between turning the steering wheel and seeing the front wheels turn hasn't
improved much.

I can still move the steering wheel in 2-3&quot; either direction before the wheels
follow suit.

Any pointers as to what I should check next are greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Harry
