Subject: RE: [T2] Type 1 transmission codes??

I am thinking you have a 72-73 tranmisison, due to the E designation, which
was instated in 1972 to rid of the 8 tooth pinion.
This is a 5.429 R/P, not 4.12, which was some to most 1967 buses. And 67-72
sedans.

If the trans actually has AH on it:
The capital letter which identifies this gear set is supposed to be stamped
with the serial number of the transaxle on the outside of the case. It is
also the same letter that Volkswagen uses on the end of the ring &amp; pinion
part number to identify that gear ratio. Example: P/n 002 517 143 M

Then it is a bug trans from 67-72, with a 4.12 R and P, very similar to 1967
bus.

I have an IRS transmission and I'm trying to figure out what it is. Just

where are the code no's on these trannies? If I've found the right no's it

says the no. 32 centered at the top, then under that is 113-301-103, then

centered under that is the letter E, then under that the VW logo. These no's
are actually raised, not stamped.



32

113-301-103

E

VW



Is this the code? and what do I have here?

Thanks,

Courtney
