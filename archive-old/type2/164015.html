 By William Keck, USA TODAY
Feelin' groovy? Perhaps it's because an Oscar-nominated movie and a far-out
TV show have taken you on a little head trip back to the flower-power era
via vintage Volkswagen buses.

In *Little Miss Sunshine*, the dysfunctional Hoover family hopped in a
yellow one for their trek to the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. And on
Wednesday's *Lost*, Hurley (Jorge Garcia) stumbled upon an old blue model
buried in the brush.

*Lost*'s transportation department picked up two VWs in Oahu, where the show
films, and fitted them with the Dharma Initiative logo.

&quot;The VW bus seemed like the perfect fit for (Dharma's) hippie esthetic,&quot;
co-executive producer Edward Kitsis explains.

Adds co-executive producer Adam Horowitz: &quot;We also wanted Hurley's discovery
of it to affect him in a positive way. The VW seemed to immediately evoke
feelings of optimism, freedom and hope.&quot;

Brian O'Kelly, head of a California chapter of the Vintage Volkswagen Club
of America, says: &quot;Everyone is nostalgic. Back then, families didn't have
DVD players and iPods. When you traveled in a bus like that, you traveled as
a family.&quot;

The yellow bus in *Little Miss Sunshine* was manufactured from 1968 through
the mid-'70s, and *Sunshine* producer Peter Saraf fell so in love with the
bus that it is now parked in his garage. &quot;I actually bought that bus after
we wrapped,&quot; he says.

That comes as no surprise to O'Kelly, who has been watching vintage VW buses
gain popularity: &quot;You can still get your own used bus for about a thousand
bucks and restore it yourself.&quot;
