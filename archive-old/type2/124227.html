Subject: Re: [T2] Power Bleeder

Hi Mike,

Sounds interesting. Could you give more detail on how you implemented a
pressure tight seal between the tube and plastic reservoir cap?

Thanks,
Bill Moon
  I &quot;built&quot; a pressure bleeder using:

  Bus windshield washer bottle
    (the owners manual says the bottle can take up to 40PSI) Brake reservoir
  cap (bus depot $0.42) Tubing (home depot $2.00) Brass nipple (home depot
  $2.00)

  And a bike pump with pressure guage
  (connects to the bottles inflation valve)
  .........
  Good luck
