Hello all,  I purchased a '76 bus (fuel injected) this summer, it sat for
many years.  In great shape but gas tank is rusted inside.  I change gas
filters often, every 60M.  For a few weeks now, when I attempt to warm the
engine or drive anywhere, the engine revs for perhaps ten seconds then
dies/sputters for ten seconds.  I'm assuming that my injectors are not dead
as it is revving and such.  I as well just replaced my gas pump.  I will be
taking engine out to clean but I'm wondering if this problem is something
else.  Thanks all.
