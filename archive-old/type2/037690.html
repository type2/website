Subject: need help on starting prob

Have a 70 westy and recently replaced the starter after having the westy
sit idle for 5-6 months.  I was only able to drive it a few days when I
started having big probs getting it to go more than 30 mph with it floored
in 3rd gear-- wouldn't go faster.  I have some gas / exhaust fumes also.
I suspect it is the carb.
I did take out the drain plug and didn't see any gunk there. Any suggestions?
thanks!
