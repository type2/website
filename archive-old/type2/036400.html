Subject: hydraulic valves

Hi,
     I have a 77 westy with a 78 engine(2000cc) that has hydraulic push rods 
and I was told the valves didn't need adjusting. When I
took it to get a inspection before I bought it thought the mechanic told me 
that I needed a valve adjustment. A sticker on the
engine I believe says something about not adjusting the valves.
Help!?!

Alex,
