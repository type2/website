Subject: Re: Friday Topic

Not really a stretch bus but I'm trying to make my bus a littlier &quot;campier&quot; 
by making an expandable living room by making the middle section on the 
drivers side like a big drawer that could slide out moving the stove cabinet 
out of the way while your camping. Still haven't got all the bugs worked out 
though.Kind of like the larger RV's.
