Subject: [T2] URGENT - Your sharp eyes needed...

This was just posted by the National Park Service on their daily
report/bulletin.

It IS VW-related, but not Type 2/bus/transporter specific.

Thanks for the bandwidth...

Gulf Islands NS (MS/FL) - Kidnapping

A 22-month-old girl was kidnapped from the Davis Bayou campground on
October 25th.

The girl, Emily Propps, had been staying in a tent at the campground with
her parents, Charlotte Slater and William Propps, and a family that they'd
met several days previously at a truck stop.  Propps and Slater contacted
police at 2:30 a.m. yesterday morning and reported that Brian McCulley, 32,
and Ulanda Kay McCulley, 21, had taken Emily to a truck stop for dinner so
that their own child of approximately the same age would have a companion.
The McCulley's never returned.

They are believed to be driving a black Volkswagen Jetta with a temporary
Missouri license plate in the rear window.  The investigation is being
directed by police from Ocean Springs with assistance from the NPS, Jackson
County SO, and the FBI.  The names (not yet confirmed to be their actual
names) have been entered into NCIC and the child has been listed on the
FBI's national missing children bulletin board.  Information has been
prepared for regional law enforcement agencies to distribute to truck stops
throughout the Southeast, as the McCulley's are known to frequent them.
