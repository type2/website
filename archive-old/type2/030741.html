Hm. Well, I always use premium in my bus. I used to drive a 71 c*rolla
that was given to me because every time you put your foot on the brake,
the silly thing would die. This was right before they phased out leaded
gas in Oregon. For some reason, she had been using unleaded in it, and
when I switched over to leaded, it was fine. When they phased out leaded,
I switched to premium, and didn't have any problems with it. but this car
simply would not run on regular unleaded. So, yes, I did see a marked
performance increase from higher octane gas.

&gt; Second, most consumer advocate organizations have been reporting that
&gt; higher octane is only useful if you engine is pinging on lower octane gas.
&gt; They have discounted any other performance gains.  Can anyone verify a
&gt; performance increase from higher octane gas?
