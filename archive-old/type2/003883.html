Hi Isaiah,
    I am not sure about a Type I engine, but I gave $200 for a complete Type
IV 1700 (dual Solex carbs) and a complete Type IV 1800 FI engine last year.
Both about the same deal as yours.  Both running when removed from rust
buckets 3 or 4 years previously.  The 1700 currently powers my 73 and the
1800 went to my mechanic in compensation for his repair bill.  I figure I
got more than my money's worth!  $100 per ain't bad.  Good luck.

Subject: engine worth it?


&gt;hey listees.....
&gt;Suprisingly enough I found a guy who was really into v-dubs in my little
&gt;town of 7,000!  He sold all of his stuff except for a transaxle off of a
&gt;71 bug....and an engine out of a 71.
&gt;The engine has the clutch and flywheel and everything with it....heat
&gt;exchangers are good, muffler is well...needs to be replaced but
&gt;everything else is there....it has been sitting for 4 years with nothing
&gt;done to it...but he said last time it was running it ran like a sewing
&gt;machine...smooth.
&gt;He wants 300 bucks for it....  How much does a good motor usually go
&gt;for?  The compression is fine...and even has all of the hoses that
&gt;usually get torn...or fall off over time...
&gt;
&gt;I was thinking about buying if for my 71 bus...just as a spare.
&gt;but if someone wants it....thats fine....just p-mail me....its in mid
&gt;wisconsin.
&gt;
&gt;My main question was....how much do motors like this usually go for?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks!
