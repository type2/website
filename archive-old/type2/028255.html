Hi Folks,

Thanks for the suggestions.  Upon closer inspection (as close as I dare 
without getting my work clothes oily), you all seem to have hit it on the 
head.  My valve covers and pushrods seem to be leaking the most.  I'll keep 
y'all posted when I fix them.

Thanks again for the prompt and accurate help.
