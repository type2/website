Subject: Re: Engine Drop

I ran a chain, with a short piece of 2x4 directly under the tranny housing,
to support the trans, then dropped the motor only.  Pretty simple.  I spent
more time labeling wires than it took to actually drop the motor.

And for the price of a postal address, you can have a copy of my engine
dolly plan (come to think of it, it's listed in the type2_dot_com library, but I
don't think it's particularly URL is running yet.  Steve?).  I'm not being
immodest about the plan, I'm in favor of dropping engines on ANY dolly.
Just send me your address and I'll stick a copy in the mail to you, if
you're game.   It can be built with a hand saw, some 2x lumber, a drill (for
the lag screws) and four casters.  Makes a good stool for later work, too.

Good luck with the drop.
