&gt; The Riviera is IMHO a bit poor in the floor space arrangement. Thanks to
&gt; the ice box right next to the sliding door you can't carry much but
people.
&gt; It is the first thing that would come out and live in the garage if I had
one.

Mine was ripped out 2 PO's ago, never to be seen again.


&gt; My biggest pet peeve is that at least on a '78 Riviera you can't reach the
&gt; interior sliding door handle. Bad for emergencies and just bad when you
&gt; don't want to crawl out the front door in the morning.

It's the same in the 72.

&gt; I prefer the lopsided Westy arrangement.

There is a Riviera here in Birmingham at a junk yard with the lopsided Westy
interior. Someone went to alot of trouble.

&gt;I prefer even more the Marco Polo
&gt; Vito design (as long I get the Mercedes along with the interior components
&gt; - - grin!).

&gt; Those slow Corvair vans? Must have been 2 speed power glides. Everybody I
&gt; have talked to said 70 mph in 3rd gear in a Trans-Vair (they have 4
speeds)
&gt; and a couple mpg better to boot.

Heck he has 40 Corvairs, the 4 Vans and 5 or 6 pick ups... I would think he
has one that would go somewhat fast.
