Subject: RE: [T2] Pop top fixin up Q's:

&lt; I've read about pop tops for Westies being easy to replace, but what about 
for Rivieras?  This is the only one I haven't tried to look up, so apologies 
if the info is at my fingertips somewhere.  Does anyone sell reproductions 
(e.g. yellow vinyl straight-up pop tops)?

Thanks very much in advance!

Dawn at PLFVW_dot_com can make these.

You can pick the color, which is nice considering they are $375, or an 
additional $75 for sunbrella material.

best,
cr
