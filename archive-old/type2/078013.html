Subject: RE: [T2] Bus Heat


&gt;I'm rather surprised that ordinary rubbing alcohol will burn well enough.
&gt;Rubbing alcohol is only 70% alcohol (30% water) and is hard to light.  You
&gt;can get 90% alcohol.

I've used mine for years now with various brands of rubbing alcohol. Never
had a problem with it.

&gt;An alcohol flame is not very visible.  If you use ethanol the flame is
&gt;almost invisible, particularly in light.  It will still burn you.

That's why I only use rubbing alcohol. It burns yellow and blue. Quite
visible. 

Yes, there are some safety concerns. I'm not advertising these things. I'm
only saying I've used mine for years now without a problem. It's a chance
I'm willing to take.

Jim
