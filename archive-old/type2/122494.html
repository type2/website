It's really silly to mess with any other method when these clamps work so
well. I had a rubber glove on for grip (mainly for spills) and just used my
thumb to roll the wheel.

Before you go rushing off and ordering directly from Stahlwille they are
cheaper at a few other places so check the shipping costs.

www.mototools_dot_com has them for $7.95

Zelenda has them for sale as a pair for $52.50! Do not pay that. Baum sells
a knockoff #647B but I don't know how much it costs.

There are also two sizes of clamps so make sure it's SF12975 which is the
smaller right sized clamp. Lisle sells a &quot;hose pincher&quot; but the Stahlwille
clamp is better.
