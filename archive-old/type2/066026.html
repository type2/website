The bush should be a snug fit.

Tighter is probably better than looser and it should be good for 50K miles 
at least before you have to struggle again.

A loose bush might spin in the casing which can sometimes be identified by a 
metallic 'shriek' when turning the starter motor. Worn casings are usually a 
result of the bush having disintegrated completely in the past, or  because 
somebody has used brute force and sharp instruments to extract a worn bush.

Probably good practice to check and replace the bush as a matter of course 
whenever the engine is out.
