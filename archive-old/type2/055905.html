Happy Monday all,

        If you have been following the thread, here are the results.   A
special thanks to Bob Hoover and Sean Bartnik who spotted both sides of my
problem.        

          It turns out I had two problems at once.  This is what made the
problem so confusing.  The problem didnt happen all the time...only after
hitting some bumps in the road (vibration) suggesting the problem was
electrical.  The fact that it did not die abruptly and would continue to
run if I pumped the pedal suggests to me a fuel problem.  Well, it was both
an electical and a fuel problem. 

        Bob Hoover suggested the one electrical device that bridges on both
fuel and electrical is the anti-diesling device.  You may remember that I
had been reporting problems with diesling lately.  Well, it wasnt screwed
in all the way and when I jiggled it, the engine died. &quot;Hallelujah&quot; I
thought. 

         Well, after tightening everything down good, I could not seem to
get fuel to the carb.  My filters were not filling up with gas.  For the
last 40k miles, I have had a fuel filter before and after the fuel pump.  I
spend a lot of time in really sandy and dusty climates so I figured the
extra assurance couldnt hurt.  Fellow listee, Sean Bartnik recommended
getting rid of all that noise and just going with one filter.  The first
filter before the carb is not clear plastic so its condition could not be
checked.  I swear this is done purposely by manufacturers so that you will
simply replace it out of paranoia or something.  I installed one of those
glass-style filters that you find in the chrome-dressup area of your 
flaps.  I have it secured so it cant bump anything.  I run one of these
types of filters on my Sand rail and have had really good luck with it.  I
took out the small upper filter I had between the fuel pump and carb and
installed a new straight shot of hose.

        I did rebuild a carb that I have been vatting for a couple weeks
purposely in front of the current carb so maybe I scared it in to working
properly as my problems seem to be resolved!  We will see.

Thanks again All!
