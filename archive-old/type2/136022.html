&gt; What are the symptoms that you get when your decel valve craps out on

Tim,

That would sound about the right symptoms to me. To test it you have to
remove the valve and attach a mity-vac or other vac pump to the control
port (the small one). Blow[1] thru one of the big tubes as you increase
vacuum on the control line slowly.  There should be NO flow until 20&quot; and
then full flow above that.  If it opens too soon or has a constant small
leak, its bad.

Thnk you to Tom and Karl...  not the first time I've been wrong, won't be
the last :-)

Steve Dolan

[1] BLOW!!!  Do NOT suck!!!!  It opens suddenly and will be full of
crap that you do NOT want to inhale... ask Barry Burneskis!
