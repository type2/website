Subject: RE: Friday Bus fantasy

Can't believe I haven't seen the phrase &quot;3.2 liter Porsche six&quot; in any of
these fantasies.  That's definitely what every aircooled VW van wants to
have when it grows up.  As that acquisition would be followed closely by
divorce, I can probably hook a sexual fantasy right up with the bus fantasy.
