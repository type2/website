Subject: [T2] Friday's Mystery Part

 Its an oil gallery plug.You need to tap the hole. You likely lost all your
oil right? Ask me how I know. My fix was to tap the hole and put a bolt in
it. There are some other suggestions in the archives I am sure. I had to do
it while on my way home from Everybus 2002. Happened in PA and I was on my
way home to Canada. Quite an adventure.
