&lt;&lt;    I have a 66' splittie and I need to put a couple of new windshields in.
 I have tried the wire and liquid soap thing but the seal is different from a
 bug and it isn't very easy. Any suggestions? This is kind of urgent I need
 to cover the two big holes in the front if you know what I mean.
 
 Thanks,
 Dave &gt;&gt;

What type of wire are you using?I use 1/4 inch braded nylon rope and liquid
dishsoap.It definately helps to have someone apply pressure to the area the
rope is at to help keep things moving along smoothly.Also make sure to pull
the rope at an angle so as not to tear the rubber.
