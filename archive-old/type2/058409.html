Subject: Removal of Firewall Panel

I am trying to remove the firewall panel on my 1970 Westy to get the tank
out to flush it.

I have removed all the screws and expected to be able to remove it
now...Nope.  Neither side will budge.

Am I missing something?  I cannot see what is holding it in.  Checked
Bentley and it says &quot;Remove all screws then remove the panel&quot;...Thanks a
bunch.

Thanks
Derrick Lathem
