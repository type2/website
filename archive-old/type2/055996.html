Subject: Problems getting 1981 Westy running

All,

I've been browsing the list for the past year and I find the discussions
very informative.  This is my first posting and obviously I'm in need of
some ADVICE :)  Last year I purchased a 1981 Westy, not running, and tried
taking parts off my 1980 Westy (parts rig). (The 1980 has 250 KM, and some
fire damage inside :(  (my own stupidity) Anyway, after reading Bob's
sermons I replaced the double relay and the air flow sensor.  Then I
noticed that the coil was not wired properly.  Fixed that, turned the key,
and away to go.  Purred like a kitten.  When I got back at it in the spring
(May up here in Newfoundland ;) I couldn't get any satisfacetion.
Sometimes the engine would run smoothly, other times it would run very
rough.  Finally it would not start at all.  I pulled the dip stick and
found an awful smell of gas :0  I drained the oil, changed the filter and
tried again.  It sputtered a few times, then nothing AGAIN.   What can I do
from here!!  I'm not a mechanic by any means but I try my hand at it using
the Hayes and Bentley manuals.

If anyone can offer any suggestions I'd really appreciate it.  I don't know
of anyone around here that has much experience with 2 liter air cooled
engines.

Thanks,
Keith
