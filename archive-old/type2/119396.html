Subject: Re: [T2] What's the deal with all the cheap busses FS recently?

werd! One more thing, if you have a million spare parts and an engine,
it's slightly cheaper than 4k.
:)


...
&gt; There's no such thing as a cheap bus. All buses end up costing about 
&gt; $4000 by the end of a year's time unless (a) you just want a bus in 
&gt; your driveway, and don't care about driving it; or (b) you're just the 
&gt; luckiest person around.
