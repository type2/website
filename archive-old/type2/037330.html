Subject: Westy's for sale in Seattle area

Lots of you have responded w/advice and have been very interested in my 
search for a bus. I talked to a lifelong buddy last night and told him about 
my &quot;quest&quot;. He was excited for me and thought it was great I wanted one after 
having gone 23 yrs. bus-less.(he was often involved in thegood times we had 
in the 69'bus I had in mid/late 70's) Turns out he's traveling to Seattle 
each week and stays all week, and has some free time on his hands and could 
check any buses I can locate that might be candidates. He'll be doing this 
for the next two weeks. I know I want a Westy poptop. Not partial to any 
year, but probably nothing newer than '75.Anybody out that way know of 
anything? I'm not looking for any major projects. Wouls someone mind checking 
the classifieds? I'm goning to look at the buses on type2's list later this 
morning when I have a chance. I wanted to get this off  to the list first 
thing this morning. What's the name of the paper there? I can probably pull 
up their classifieds online?
Thanks in advance for your help!
