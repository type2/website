Subject: [T2] Ambulance fans ?

Please excuse my ignorance again but I've been wondering for a while what
ambulance fans are. Given the price are they made out of pure gold ?

On another note: Today I've sold my '81 diesel vanagon camper of dubious
origin (the conversion not the bus). Made a good price. I'm now down to 3
buses (or busses, what is it?) which I feel is enough for a single person.
My brand new Eurovan does the day to day job of carrying me and my cargo
around and does not require any attention. My '69 Clipper will soon hit the
streets again after being stored for winter and generally only requires
cleaning and polishing (and some gas and oil of course). So now I've got the
time and money to finish my '77 Westfalia. The engine has been rebuilt (not
by me) and I can now devote the time to patch up the rusty bits. Then later
this year or early next year it's gonna need a respray after which it will
be as good as new. Oh yes, I still have to fit that canvas that I bought off
Ron 3 years ago ....
