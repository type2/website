I went assigned value because of the modifications in my van and when I

rider for the &quot;assigned&quot; value of the modification (in this case the lower
center section)

&gt; I'm not sure that &quot;assigned value&quot; or &quot;stated
&gt; value&quot; insurance is a necessity.   Normal
&gt; insurance works in many states and definitely in
&gt; mine.  Be careful not to sign anything in your
&gt; insurance application or other contractual
&gt; material that limits your recovery to some amount
&gt; of value assigned to your vehicle.  Point is, you
&gt; don't have to settle for $400 just because some
&gt; dunderheaded insurance person says that's all
&gt; your bus is worth.  (Of course, you may have to
&gt; hold out, sue or threaten to sue, etc.)
&gt; 
&gt; Also, stated value is a problem too in that
&gt; insuring an item for more than it's worth is
&gt; usually illegal in that you have an insurable
&gt; interest only up to the item's value.  In other
&gt; words, you may still be arguing, suing etc.
