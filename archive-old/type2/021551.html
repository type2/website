&gt; Well I had really great advise on this and I'm going to relay it.
&gt; Take #1 plug out, insert a piece of wire like mabey a straight piece of
&gt; coat hanger through the hole, roll the car foreward in gear until the
&gt; piston gets all the way up enough to touch the wire (it should squeeze
&gt; the wire a little) check that your rotor arm is pointing in the general
&gt; direction of #1 spark plug wire in the cap, stop. Mark your fan shroud
&gt; and fan with a temporary marker. Leave the wire in the cylinder and move
&gt; the vehicle in reverse, in gear until the piston again touches the wire,
&gt; mark this spot temporarily. The spot in the middle is Exact TDC, mark it
&gt; permanently.
