Subject: Re: When/what to overhaul

&gt;The engine in question is a 1776 with 55,000 miles.  It belongs to a 
&gt;friend.  He parked the car one day and the next the engine would not 
&gt;turn over.  It turned back and forth but was stuck in one spot.  We 
&gt;figured there was a valve sitting in one of the cylinders.  We torn it
&gt;down and found a huge amount of carbon in the number one cylinder had 
&gt;blocked the thing from turning.  With the heads removed and the 
&gt;cylinders wired in place the engine turns fine by hand.

If there was enough carbon build-up after only 55,000 miles to sieze the
engine there are probably problems that have to be dealt with to prevent
this from reoccuring.  I'm guessing factors for major carbon buildup would
be a lot of short-run type driving or a lot of sitting at idle, weak spark,
over rich fuel mixture.  Was your friend experiencing detonation problems
also?  That would cause additional wear and tear on the pistons and
bearings, though personally since the endplay is good, I probably wouldn't
split the case to investigate further and I'd hope for another 30-40,000
miles or so on the bottom end (BTW, is this engine in a bug or bus?).

&gt;Should the p&amp;c's be replaced at this time?  Is is possible to just 
&gt;clean them up and replace the rings?  What about rod bearings?

The cost of honing the jugs and cleaning up the ring grooves gets on the
road to the $100 or so it costs for a new set of type I pistons.  While it
might be more cost effective for type IV owners to hone their jugs,  I
believe the benefits of paying a bit more for a fresh type I piston set
outweighs the short term savings.  

Good luck,

Ron
