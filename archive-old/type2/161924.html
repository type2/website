Subject: Bosch sucks a***

Turns out the universe is still rotating as it should. It wasn't the new
sucky, made in Mexico bosch coil. It was a tach wire somehow shorted to
ground that buggered stuff up. 12 v to coil, I manually opened opened and
closed points but got no spark. Never even thought to pull off extra leads
from negative post of coil. No idea where or how that short happened-vehicle
ran fine until shut off, and when we went to start up, wire was shorted.
Weird. And here I thought my bus had stranded me. :)

Bus 1, Nathaniel 0
