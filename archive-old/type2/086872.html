&gt; 	   Well, after over 10,000 miles through the desert, forest and coast I
&gt; finally saw my poor 76 camper on the back of a tow truck last night. Luckily
&gt; it is only the accelerator belt that snapped, but I need another one soon,
&gt; because I am moving this weekend! I am in Palo Alto; does anyone know where
&gt; to get one short notice around here?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks much!
