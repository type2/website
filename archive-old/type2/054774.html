Subject: stall, almost. hesitation

my 68 single cab has had a bit of trouble since I bought it. In first and 
second gear when letting off the clutch, you have to be very slow and 
particular or it will act as if its going to stall. when down shifting to 
second upon release of the clutch it hesitates and for a second or two has 
very little power, then every thing is fine it powers up and you continue on 
your way as normal. also sometimes it is a little dificult to get into gear, 
particularly down shifting.
    the clutch and pressure plate where installed in 87, but have only 17k on 
them. I have the engine out today for an alternator conversion, and the pilot 
bearing looks fine to me. 

    also, the throw out bearing set up in bays is new to me and I have yet to 
purchase a bently, do I need to grease the tube that the bearing slides on 
before I reinstall the motor? if so what type of grease?
