Thanks for the replies folks.  Just so ya know - it was already a 12v unit, 
which is why I chose it.  No need for the cigarette lighter adapter deal 
from the Rat Shakk, with the wire snaking hither and yon (gawd I luvv them 
words!).  I could have soldered wires to the contacts in the battery 
compartment but I have had bad experiences in the past soldering to wiring 
that I was unable to see what was behind it (sometime ask me about the 
clock-radio based timer project).  The contacts in the battery compartment 
for the (+) do not protrude enough to get an alligator clip on (I tried that 
already).  I'm looking at ultimately installing it under the stove, once the 
aux battery project is completed.  I offer the $2.50 and 45 minute project 
as an alternative to $pending bux on batteries ;-)

&quot;The question is, said Alice, whether words can mean so many things&quot;
