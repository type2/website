I plan on attending.  I wouldn't mind putting a few faces to the names of
people here on the list.

I will be driving a white '79 Beetle Convertible with a small pop-up camper
behind it.  The car is triple white.  The camper is white with blue canvas.
I'm sure there will be more than one triple white convertible there.  You
can identify mine by looking at the radio.  It has an in-dash AM/FM 8track
player and will more than likely have a tape in it.

Please feel free to stop by and say hello.

'77 Westfalia

&gt;&gt; Any listees attending the 7th Annual Volunteer Bug Jam in Knoxville this
&gt;&gt; weekend?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;While we will not be in attendance, The Bus Depot is a major sponsor of
this
&gt;show.  They will also be raffling off a Westfalia camper which has a lot of
&gt;donated Bus Depot parts on it (with the proceeds to help fund the show and
&gt;the local VW club that sponsors it). Maybe a listmember will win the
camper!
&gt;
&gt;If you stop by the NVWSA booth (where the camper is, I believe), you can
&gt;pick up a free copy of our new Catalog (which is usually available only for
&gt;a charge).
