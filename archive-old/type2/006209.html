My brake lights worked before I removed the engine; now that I've installed
again, they don't work. Bulbs, grounds, etc, all checked out good. I can't
seem to read juice to the bulb.

The master cylinder has two, three prong pressure switches on it, one about
in the middle and one near the back end. How do I read these for operation?
I can't seem to figure out how the connect except that the center terminals
on both wire connectors are common to each other, as are the side terminals.
None of the switch terminals seem to read continuity at any time.

TIA,
Dave
