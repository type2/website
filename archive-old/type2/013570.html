Subject: Bus rental in Holland

Does anyone know if a bus can be hired for a few days in the Netherlands (I know of a company in the UK that does this). I will be in Holland from the middle of July to early August and will need some transportation for some of that time.  I will probably have to hire the standard new car but it wouldn't it be nice have a bus instead.

All legalities aside, wouldn't it be great if buses were available to list members around the world, like a time-share bus club.
