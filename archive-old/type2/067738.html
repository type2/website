&gt;I'm afraid I disagree with Fig here...
&gt;
&gt;Definitly on a 'loaf' the steering wheel comes of and is on splines so can be
&gt;moved. I've had mine off several times.
&gt;
&gt;Don't know about splittis though.
&gt;
I've never worked on a loaf -- I was referring to splitties; my apologies
for not making that clear. Nonetheless, there does seem to be some
disagreement as to whether all splitties used the woodruff key or if some
had splines. Anyone know for certain?

I don't think Bob's description of the rubber whatnot etc applies to a
splitty -- the steering shaft is an integral part of the steering box (at
least it was on the 62 kombi I took a steering box out of, and on the 58
that I put it back into).
