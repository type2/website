Subject: Upstate Vermont Listies

Debbie and I will be flying to Vermont this Friday for the weekend and I was
wondering if any one on the list was from Burlington on the way to Troy
Vermont?

Any good junk yards with busses or is most of the stuff rusted away?

I'll have a few hours that I will need to get away from the family so a good
junk yard trip might be in order.

Thanks

The Male Meredith
