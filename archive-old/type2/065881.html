Subject: Re: buses, environmental degradation 

Howdy Volks,

The simple thing I suggest if you are concerned about the 
environmental impacts of your precious aircooled bus is this:
Drive it less and enjoy it more.

Second: Fix your oil leaks. I know this is tough, but motor oil
on our roads is a big source of pollution.

I wonder how long I would have to drive a newer car before I 
would amortize the environmntal costs of making a new car 
(all that steel, plastic, paint, rubber). As anyone who has ever driven the 
elevated highway through South Chicago and Gary (or explored the possibility 
of eating fish from Lake Michigan) can attest, the manufacture  of 
steel is a very dirty business. To model this would take more information,
economics, and spreadsheet driving than I have time to acquire today, but
I am curious.

I think installing a CAT converter to a bus that lacks one would be a simple
matter of buy it and bolt it on. Mine has no O2 sensors or other gizmos
and it is downstream of any sensors on all cars I know of.

Drive safely,
Surfer Bob
