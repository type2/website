I don't know about New Jersey, but in Oregon it is definitely NOT &quot;full
service pumping&quot;, required or otherwise.

For some totally obscure reason the State government [or the industry
lobby] - doesn't think
&quot;non-professionals&quot; are capable of discerning and handling the intricacies
of a gasoline [or diesel] pump.

Years ago when we made frequent crossings of Oregon on I-5 en route to S.
California we were actually angrily ejected from the premises by station
staff for having the nerve to lay hands on the fuel nozzle.

We've also had station staff demand the surrender of our gasoline credit
card as punishment for the dreaded &quot;laying hands on the nozzle&quot; offense.
[They didn't get the card :-) ]

After a lifetime of pumping a couple of bazillion gallons of assorted liquid
fuels old habits die hard.....

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Living in the midwest I have neever heard of required full service
pumping.  Why do they have this?  It just sounds like one of those crazy old
state laws.  &lt;&lt;
