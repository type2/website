Subject: engine conversions

Gentlepersons-
                       ...Friend of mine picked up a '79 Bus, minus the 
engine and trans. I've
got a trans from a '71 that I'll lend-lease him, and I'm sure a 1600 Bug 
engine is avail-
able. I tried the library and archives (unless I'm not asking correctly), but 
nothing turned up. How difficult would this switch be? Available parts and 
cost are primary con-
siderations for him; ease of installation for me- since I'll probably do most 
of the wrenching...
Thanks in advance, and if there's a site/source for this info already, please 
redirect.
