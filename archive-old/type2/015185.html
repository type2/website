Subject: Boston Bob's: Adjusting Hydraulic Valves (F)
Mime-Version: 1.0

T2 List:

Here's a nice note I got from Bob Donalds (whose back in Bean-Town) and
a very interesting short article on his experience adjusting the Vanagon 
hydraulic valve set up.  This has been incorporated into the new Bentley's 
as someone recently mentioned:

&gt;Craig,

&gt;Nice to hear from you. I can't build type 4 engines fast enough--what's with
&gt;that? My current price is 2K and I have found a cam that works with the stock
&gt;fuelie set up. It has more lift and that seems to make the heads run cooler.
&gt;I am rewriting my hydraulic lifter article and I posted the note below to
the &gt;vanagon list...would you post the note below to the type 2 list for me?
&gt;
&gt;Bob

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A R T I C L E &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

&gt;Fellow Vanagon types:

&gt;I have been reading the posts on adjusting lifters with interest, as I am
&gt;currently putting together an article on my experience with vanagon hydraulic
&gt;lifters. The vanagon book published by Bentley is about to be reprinted.
For &gt;years, Bentley Publishing has worked hard to review comments from the
those &gt;that have taken the time to write or phone things in that they felt
needed to &gt;be corrected or clarified every time the book is reprinted. The
next printing
&gt;will include some 50 changes. One of these changes will be about bleeding
&gt;and adjusting the hydraulic lifters. There were 2 versions of how to bleed
&gt;the air out of the hydraulic lifter before installation. They where on pages
&gt;15.7 and 15.24. both where confusing and vague. Bentley also has in the
&gt;vanagon CD (released last year) added what they call an &quot;editors note&quot;.
This &gt;note says, in part, that there is a problem with hydraulic lifters
becoming &gt;air bound and that preloading hydraulic valves should be
considered optional. &gt;This editors note will also be in the newest printing
of the big green book.

&gt;  With the help of Erin at AVP, plus the constant feedback from my
&gt;customers and the nice people of this list, I have come up with a simple
&gt;method for removing all the air from the hydraulic lifters prior to
&gt;installation. This method does not solve or prevent the lifters from pulling
&gt;in air after the engine has been sitting and it is not a solution for air
&gt;bound lifters that DO expand when the engine heats up. Air bound lifters DO
&gt;hold the valves when the engine warms up. The 006.ths clearance cold is 
&gt;needed when air is present in the lifters 0 lash will not do. The most
common &gt;symptoms of air bound lifters are poor performance running rich and
low &gt;manifold vacuum. It has been my observation that preloading properly
bled &gt;lifters will self-adjust in as little as 10 minutes. It has been my
experience  &gt;that air bound lifters will NEVER self-adjust when preloaded
or bleed because &gt;of the air that is trapped above the check valve. The
extent of the problem &gt;varies widely. I know there will be those that
disagree with me. My completed &gt;article will be posted on my web site in
the very near future.
