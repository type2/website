&gt; Why would you want to go through undoing the CV joints, linkage etc, to
&gt; pull the tranny just to get the engine out.  I don't understand.
&gt; 

    Well, I didn't believe it either, but David convinced me to try it,
and now that I have, I can say it's worth it just because putting it
back in is so much easier. 
    This is on a T4, not the T1 on the earlier buses. On my '69, with
the removable rear member, you could slide the engine right in and out,
but on the T4's it is a major hassle for me to do it. Having the engine
and tranny together when you put it back is just much, much easier. 
     I once pulled the engine in my '69 four times in one afternoon, and
had it back in and running each time -- no big deal. On my T4 it's a all
day affair for even once in and out -- just a lot more weight to try to
balance and you can't slide it in and out, and there's not really quite
enough room to work with.
