&gt; Whatever you do, *Please* buy the ones that look like cables on &quot;modern&quot;

yes sir,!!!1  one of the reasons for getting the new cables, the old ones
are the leaded type

&gt; Not that I am against the lead in them, but the later model stuff in
&gt; combination with the little felt anti-corosion pads just work so much
&gt; better.
&gt;
&gt; Yes, they will cost more, but in my experience, they are worth every cent.

cheap when you get started at 4AM and it is 3F degrees outside.

&gt; Seems like 31&quot; or so for my 78 for the positive.  and maybe 12&quot; for the
&gt; negative...the negative I bought had 2 ground lugs on it...I put one under
&gt; the fi box and the other in the regular place....double ground!

hey great idea, double ground

&gt; Remember battery terminals are *not* the same size.

but of course
