On my '73 the hi-beam headlights stay on. When I try to click them down to
low beams they don't.

I have removed the switch and inspected the contacts and it all seems okay.
Does this go to a relay? Could that be shot?

Any ideas? Could the PO installed the wrong type of headlights?

Does anyone have any ideas?
