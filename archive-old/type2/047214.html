Subject: Re: [T2] W*terboxer Parts?

Shawn - Where are you?  I sure could use a passenger side replacement
louvered window with screen...  I've got a '72 camper, and am in CA.  

Or just those screens in good condition...  Wouldn't mind having a few
spares, they're not getting any more available...

But you're probably in, like, Missouri...  ;-)  One of those M
states...  

Anyone else have the items in question they'd be willing to part with? 
Which years should I be able to pull from?

I really need to take a few weekends and prowl locally to see what's
available...  Just haven't quite gotten to that part yet.

When I do, I'll see if y'all want me to keep a lookout for anything. 
Anyone else in the silicon valley?  Want to plan a run?  I'd dearly love
to have some company, and will buy the first frosty pitcher after... 
And maybe the second.

Teri
