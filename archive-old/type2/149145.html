&gt;I think I need to replace the wire running from the ignition switch to my 
&gt;solenoid. What's the best way to route such a wire and what gauge wire 
&gt;should I buy?

The stock wire was 4.0mm2 which is roughly 11AWG so I'd say go up one size to 10AWG.

The wire from the switch according to the wiring diagram is 2.5mm2 and goes into a tee. Have you tested that connection?

&gt;My newish ignition switch does make the solenoid click, but it rarely turns 
&gt;over. This with a strong battery, clean connections and a new starter motor. 
&gt;My auxiliary start button at the back(which connects to the same crimp on 
&gt;terminal the other wire does) fires it up like lightning every time. It 
&gt;could be the new electrical switch but I suspect a voltage drop between 
&gt;there and the back, due to old and undersized wires.

Have you tried to measure the resitance of that wire by extending the lead on your ohmeter?
