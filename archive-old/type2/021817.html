&gt; True, but if you watch your valve train work as you are giving the preload you can tell that this in effect is holding your valves open, until enough oil is pushed out of the lifter to achieve zero clearance.
&gt; 
By setting the lifters as close to zero as possible, the drive train
tension is minimilized, and I am certain that over the course of time
will lead to longer life of the lifters.

1.   In my experience, unless you do the adjustment hot right after
running the engine, the preload pushes the piston of the lifter in, not
the valve, since there is no oil pressure. As the valve pumps to its
maximum, the lash allowed lessens to zero.
2. The drive train tension is controlled by the hefty valve springs
balancing the the oil pressure keeping the lifter a given &quot;length&quot;.
The preload pushes against the much weaker spring inside the lifter and
pushes down the piston under the pushrod.  The tension is the same
whether you go in 1/2 turn or 3 turns (see below).

I just examined a new lifter, and I correct myself- the free play of the
piston under the pushrod is 4 mm, so the midpoint is indeed 2 mm down,
or 2 full turns of the adjustor if each turn is a mm.  The lower piston
has a groove in its top that lets oil access the lifter through the side
hole.  Look through the hole as you push down the piston, and you will
see the upper piston bottom appearing.  It has 4 hollows in its bottom
that let oil inside the bore of the lower piston.  Push it down about
2mm, and the bottom of the upper piston will be centered in the hole. 
Oil can easily access around the upper piston, go through the piston's
side hole, out the center hole, and into the pushrod so it can
eventually lubricate the rockers.  The bore around the upper piston is
loose, (notice you can rock the piston) allowing oil to also escape
around the piston into the pushrod tube.  The &quot;zero backlash&quot; provided
must be due to the oil under the piston and inside the lower piston,
where it can also access the check valve, equalize the oil around the
spring cavity, and flow around this much tighter piston.  You will also
notice that through the range of free play, the spring tension on the
piston is equal.  Now when you apply a preload (turning in the
adjustor), think of this as the MAXIMUM available valve lash- ie, the
piston can NEVER reach the snapring if you apply at least one turn (1 mm
and if no oil were in the lifter).   However, if you have a lifter that
needs pumping up for 20 minutes, you are not lifting the valve very
much, in fact, a mm lower than if you adjusted the piston in the MIDDLE
of its play.
   Now there are conditions where the lash will increase and you could
hit the snap ring- wear in the cam bearings, wear on the cam lobe, wear
on pushrod ends, wear in the rocker assembly, or even wear on the
adjustor and valve stem ends.    The design of any hydraulic lifter is
to be set in the midrange of its piston movement so engine clearances
that change due to heat and wear can be accomodated within that range.
