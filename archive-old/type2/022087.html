&lt;&lt; I also did not try installing the
 springs between the head and the rocker arm assembly as did the PO, such
 that torquing the rockers leaves impressions of the springs on the head,
 but rather followed the photo in Bentley &amp; clipped the springs in the
 slots below the rockers. Sure hope they don't sproing loose and cause
 some kind of adventure.) &gt;&gt;


this is one difference between the type iv motor and the upright 1600's.  on 
an upright the slot on the rocker assembly poits up, whereas a type iv it is 
down so as to hold the springy thing............
