Subject: Tire info - definitive source

I was perusing my copy of the 'Pocket Ref'* and came across the following.

&quot;If you want detailed information on tires, sizes, recommendations for
different cars, etc. use a book entitled &quot;1999 Tire Guide&quot; (get the
one for the current year), published by Tire Guides Inc., 1101-6 S.
Rogers Circle, Boca Raton, FL 33487, (561)997-9229. Cost of the book
is $11.95 and contains an abundance of information.&quot;

*'Pocket Ref' ISBN 1-885071-00-0  An amazing little book for techno-lovers!
