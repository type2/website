&gt; Ok, I'm still trying to solve my Bus's oil leak.
&gt; I took off the Rubber Bellows (connects the dipstick guide pipe into the
&gt; crankcase) and it does indeed have a small tear.

A good local VW mechanic told me he likes to use a Chevy spark plug cover
instead of the stock little rubber hosie to seal the dipstick tube. I've
got one. It's much more durable looking, it's oil proof, and has been
working very well for several years now. FLAPS probably has 'em for cheap.

Surfer Bob says, &quot;Check it out.&quot;
