My engine is being rebuilt by AVP and will be ready soon. Now, who can
answer the following?  Email me with answers to any or all...TIA!

1. Can I clean and reuse my oil cooler? How? Remanufactured ones are
available($120) but why not remanufacture my own?

2. Are new heater boxes worth the $189 each when what we really need is a
bus that produces little heat? Mine are not in great shape, but here in
Indiana, we must garage our rust-free bodies from December to Mid-March or
the salt will eat 'em alive.

3. This one bugs me:  3 years ago, I replaced my alternater. the new 55 amp
had a round fitting where you attach the rubber &quot;L&quot; shaped hose from the fan
shroud.  Well, I bought a new rubber piece at vw and it had a
three-quarter-moon shaped end instead of round.  So, there is no seal
connecting my alt to the cooling system, it just sorta blows in the
direction of the fitting it should be clamped to.     This was a real B%#$H
to work on with the eng in the bus, but now its out and I can fix it but
how?    See also #4.

4. Should I upgrade to the 70 amp alternater for my camper.  I hope to get
my dual battery setup working as part of this project, and I do have a
decent stereo/ amp.  I run a ac/dc tv and a ac/dc vcr while traveling any
distance to keep the 3 chili's smilin.  I know the alternater is expensive
and mine is only 3 years old, but man is it tough to get at once the engine
is back in!

5. Who out there has my eng tin pieces? 2 litre Left rear corner.  2 Pieces
(left-rear and rear-left)  make the corner .  Thanks to those who told me to
fab it, but original would look much better when I : #6.

6. Where can I get my tin powdercoated?  I'm in southern Indiana...could go
to Louisville, Cincinatti, Indy or mail them off. Where do you guys
recommend?   Man I need #5(above) in a hurry!

7. What manual out there has a good simple explanation of my fuel injection
system?  Even Muir underestimates how big of an idiot I am. I need good pics
telling me what is what...not pages of text about air flow meters or the
likes when I dont know my air flow meter from a hole in the ground:) Give me
short and simple before the heady stuff.   This must be a good system as I
have driven my bus 65000 mi in 8 years without having to learn what is what
on the FI.

Thanks guys (n gals)!...now I'll leave room for someone else...
