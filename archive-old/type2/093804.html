&gt; OK, let me see if I can tell you what the pod is all about.
&gt; The pod is not VDO.
&gt; I cannot find a VDO pod, so the pod from the supplier is a 3rd party 
&gt; sourced one that comes in either left or right angled meter mount.
&gt; The pod I am getting would normally mount on the dash, and to the left 
&gt; side of the steering wheel, with the meters slanted to the right for 
&gt; easy viewing.
&gt; Upside down, it will mount so that the meters slant to the left.
&gt;
&gt; To my mind, but unable to see an actual installation, I sort of thought 
&gt; the pod on the dash would be the way to go.
&gt;
&gt; Now then, the vendor guy says he does not think I will like the pod 
&gt; being mounted on my dash, so he suggested the upside down scheme.
&gt;
&gt; Maybe I should just order both pods, left and right sided configuration 
&gt; mount, so as to be able to make up my own mind upon receipt, and then 
&gt; return the one I decide to not use.
&gt;
&gt; What you think ??
