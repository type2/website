Howdy pholks....  TommyBoy here with a question on lungs.  I'm considering going w/ duallies to get some more low end power to conquer those hardcore Colorado mountains this winter.  Has anyone ever run the dual Kaddies on a stock motor?  
I've heard mixed opinions...
- They are way to big
- They are spec'd on all Mexican beetles, stock by VW
- They are great if you down jet them

So, I'm flamboozled, any advice?
  Thanks Krew...
