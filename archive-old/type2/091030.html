And after rust comes PRICE PRICE PRICE.

Some sellers behave as if buses have real antique value even though they need major repairs.  It's real easy to put $2000 in a used bus before you know it.  Find out what work needs to be done and what it will cost before you buy.

&gt;&lt;&lt; 've been lurking on this list for a while, trying to find out all I can
&gt;
&gt;about buses as I've been interested in owning one, and now that my chance
&gt;
&gt;has come, I was wondering if any of you had any advice- what I should be
&gt;
&gt;looking for, what I should avoid at all costs, etc.  I'm sure you get these
&gt;
&gt;sorts of questions all the time, I just wasn't quite successful in finding
&gt;
&gt;the info in the archive.  The bus in particular I'm looking at is a '71 with
&gt;
&gt;a 1600cc engine.  Thanks in advance!

&gt;Rust,rust,rust,rust,rust (with apologies to K. Lear;-)
&gt;Everything else mechanical is easier...
&gt;Front beam first...
&gt;Rear suspension...
&gt;Chassis and floors...
&gt;Everything else...
&gt;
&gt;The general consensus is, unless you're a proficient 
&gt;welder (or want to become one), the body is the
&gt;most expensive (time and money) to rebuild once
&gt;it starts to get noticeable/dangerous...
&gt;
&gt;Relatively, the mechanicals are all rebuildable/
&gt;replaceable with new or good used from this 
&gt;list or its vendors...Creativity counts! Lots
&gt;of hints and tips on the list for various
&gt;work-arounds for hard to do procedures!
&gt;
&gt;With a decent structure to start with,
&gt;many list members have used a bus and
&gt;rebuilt it while keeping it a daily driver...
&gt;
&gt;Have fun!
