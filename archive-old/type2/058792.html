Well im a little reluctant to post this stuff without contacting the
sellers but it's for sale and i dont have room (sh*t) - prices are
canadian dollars - so folks so of the border pay like 65% of whats
listed - and interestingly - in todays local paper there was an article
about how local used car salesmen are whinning becuase so many americans
come to the canadian car auctions and buy everything - the following ads
are in yesterday's local &quot;Buy and Sell&quot; - im sure everyone knows a
similar mag
