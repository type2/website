Subject: 74' Fridge Wiring

Hello all,

	I have a 74' Deluxe with a fridge that came from a donor 74' (I
think?).  Mine was missing.  The problem is that the wiring is not all
attached.  I didn't remove the fridge, so I don't know how it was
originally.
	I have a hot wire and a ground (both enclosed in a plastic
connector) leading up to the fridge from bus wiring harness.  On the
fridge I've identified a switch labeled for (110)AC or (12V)DC and
another rotary switch that has no label or knob.  I figure the second
switch is the thermostat and combination on/off switch.  There is also a
terminal block (or resistor?) with wires running to and from it.  Most of
the wires running between the switches and the block are intact.  The
wires running from the guts of the fridge are generally disconnected. 
I'm not even sure if all the wires are there.
	In the simplest of terms I have about 6 loose wires on the fridge
and two wires on the bus.  That's four extra that I don't know what to do
with.
	If someone could tell me where the two wires on the bus connect
to on the fridge, that would be a big help.  I kind of assume they come
off the rotary switch (thermostat, on/off).  Once I know where these
wires run I might be able to figure it out.  Gotta love that old &quot;trial
and error&quot; problem solving method.
	The wires on the bus are Red and Brown or Red and Black, I can't
remember which.  All the wires on the fridge have a white cloth coating.
	I've searched the archives several times trying to find a wiring
diagram, but there are a lot of questions and so few answers (such as
life).  Any and all help would greatly be appreciated.  I've gotten
everything else on this bus (as far as camper stuff) to work properly, so
I'd love to have a functioning fridge, even if they are not the greatest.
