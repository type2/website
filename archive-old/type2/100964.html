Subject: Re: [T2] Qu re using 77-78 FI stuff in a 75 FI engine

&gt; beteen me and Jon as to whether we can replace the 75 airbox/throttle
&gt; which has  the funky throttle switch (he said they get dirty &amp; that's
&gt; why they were removed by late 76?) with one off a parts engine I have
&gt; that has a later harness, 7 pin AFM, and I guess I'd need a later (77 or
&gt; 78) ECU?  The parts engine has 2 injector connectors cut off, and we
&gt; don't know which harness ends go to which cylinders- does this really
&gt; matter?  I recall reading that all the injectors get pulsed at the same
&gt; time (taken off the wire to the condensor), injecting 1/2 of the final
&gt; needed gas each pulse?
&gt; Is that true?  

true any injector plug can be interchanged with any other injector plug.  

&gt;     If I do use the later FI, I realize the volume of the 75 engine
&gt; (1800) is not like the 2000 - but Jon says since it's air flow
&gt; controlled, it should not matter that the later ECU is used when matched
&gt; to the AFM???

I ran a 71, 411 eninge in my bus while the 2 liter was being rebuilt,
switched the FI and it worked well enough that I didn't even futz with it
for the couple months it was in there
