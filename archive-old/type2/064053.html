The Inuvik Run -- Together Again

July 23

At Ten Mile Lake I broke camp early, but not as early as the hay-
growing sisters from the other side of Clinton, who pulled out
while I was fixing a cholesterol-laden breakfast of bacon and
eggs.  They didn't wave, didn't look my way.  I had become the
Invisible American.

I said good-bye to the mosquitos and swung back south through
Quesnel.  I checked campgrounds east and west of Quesnel on
Highway 26 but no one had seen anything of the missing trekkers.

It seems impossible I could of missed the Inuvikers but then, the
itinerary was never that firm.  Their intended route from
Vancouver was to follow Highway 99 over the mountains,
intersecting with Highway 97 between Cache Creek and Clinton,
near where I'd camped my first night in Canada.  From there to
Prince George there is only one major road, although it is
paralleled by a number of unpaved tracks taking you to towns like
Horsefly and Likely; there are plenty of ways for them to have
by-passed Quesnel.

But it was unlikely they would by-pass Prince George, where the
VW dealer was going to give them a free oil change.  I set a
course for Prince George and put my foot down.

At this latitude surface maintenance of the tarmac roads must be
done during the summer, which unfortunately coincides with their
season of greatest use.  Prince George is about 65 miles from
Quesnel and there was only one stretch of roadwork to contend
with.  I made the run in just over an hour.

The people at the Volkswagen dealership were very nice, a
Canadian trait I wish they could export.  They stood ready to
service a flock of Type II's, expecting them to arrive between
11:00 and noon.  Indeed, while I was chatting with the Service
Manager, Ron &amp; John wheeled up and we all peered down the road
for the others.  But they were not there.  It seems the trekkers
had made no attempt to reach Quesnel, abandoning the itinerary to
take advantage of a free campsite near Williams Lake, 75 miles
south of Quesnel, where according to Ron Coyote they were still
in the process of waking up when he lit out on my trail, shouting
for me on channel 2 as he flew thru Quesnel.  Ron has one of
those wet Volkswagens that goes like scat, when it goes.  Had I
been doing 55 instead of 65 he would of caught me on the road.

The Service Manager was surprised when I used my own oil and
filter to do my own oil change, asking only to use his waste-oil
dump.  Shit happens.  Over the years shoddy workmanship at
Volkswagen dealers have cost me two engines and an outboard gear
box.  Now, I do all of my own maintenance.  Shit still happens
but at least I don't need a lawyer to make things right.

The Volkswagen dealer in Prince George has a nice shop. 
Maintenance bays up front, handy to the street, body shop in the
rear with lots of fenced parking, engine overhaul and parts-store
over behind the salesroom, all of this under one roof.  I did my
maintenance in the parking lot so as not to take up space that
could be earning them money.

Besides driving a water-pumper, Ron Coyote communicates using a
slab of Apple pie, a thing so ridiculously narrow-minded its
built-in modem could not cope with the multi-line phone at the VW
dealership.  The Apple doesn't even have a floppy drive, meaning
I can't use it to upload this trip log.  It also doesn't work very
well but certainly better than my failed Toshiba.  

After changing my oil I swept out the van then scrubbed my oil
drain pan, which is also my dish pan.  And my bath tub.

Noon rolled around and no Inuvikers.   With only two service bays
it was going to take at least three hours for them to have their
vehicles serviced meaning they wouldn't hit the road until 1500
at the earliest, after which they would all whiz off down Highway
97 at 100 km/hr for the four-hour run to our next camp, leaving
me to struggle along behind.  I decided to struggle along ahead
instead.
                                      
According to Ron the itinerary listed the next stop as Moberly
Lake, a couple hundred miles up the road from Prince George.  The
instructions for getting there were pretty simple -- all travel
instructions in British Columbia are pretty simple since they
don't have a lot of roads.  But Moberly Lake isn't on Highway 97,
it's on Highway 29, a few miles beyond where it runs into 97 at
Chetwynd.  I mumbled the directions to myself so I wouldn't get
lost: &quot;Go to Chetwynd, hang a right,&quot; and that's what I did,
after arranging to met Ron and the others at the Provincial Park,
which is where I am now.

But the four hour trip took six hours, thanks to Pine Pass,
twenty miles of unpaved road and a fellow in a Pontiac Firebird
that shoulda stood in bed.  Northbound traffic (me) had to wait
an hour for the on-coming traffic to clear the single unpaved
lane thru the pass, which has no road to speak of, although one
is under construction.  We then had to spend another hour
watching the fellow in the Firebird slither and slew and bang and
hang his way all over the road, wheels spinning, paint job
vanishing...  

A crazy guy in a big Jimmy just behind the Firebird finally
passed the Firebird in the rough, stuck his foot in it and hauled
ass thru the muddy ankle-deep gravel.  I jumped out of the line
and followed.  When the Jimmy hit pavement he was a bit
surprised to find me clinging to his bumper.  The old bus can go
fast when it has to, and does about the same speed on-pavement as
off.  

Back on the tarmac, the Jimmy took it out of four-wheel drive and
vanished at a rate of knots.  I shifted into fourth, stuck some
Beetles in the stereo and drove on.  It was half an hour before
the other traffic began catching up.  The Firebird went past like
blowing a booger out your nose.  His car was reasonably clean,
those stuck behind plastered with the gooey gray clay he'd been
flinging in all directions.

Pine Pass carries you over the Hart Range, a spur of the Rocky
Mountains.  In Prince George I was in the watershed of the Fraser
River but once across Pine Pass the waters were flowing north. 
That marks a milestone in the trip and it does so when I'm almost
exactly half-way between San Diego and Inuvik, about 2,100 miles
by the odometer.

It is now after 1900.  I've got a hunch the Inuvikers won't show
again, that they'll wander off to some other target of
opportunity as they did the night before.  Should that happen
I've no idea how to get back in touch with them.  It will be a
bit embarrassing if they fail to arrive since I've chased a
couple of would-be campers out of sites adjacent to mine,
assuming we would want to camp as a group.  At least it's a nice
camp, a smarter camp than Ten Mile Lake.  It isn't built in a bog
and the stores of firewood dotted around the park have shed
roofs.  There are no flush toilets but plenty of outhouses.  I
haven't found the showers as yet.

(After trip comments.)

I didn't find the showers because there are none at Moberly Lake. 
I had mis-read the accommodations table for the list of
campsites.

The Inuvikers eventually arrived, although after my usual bed-
time.  Even so, I was up to greet them.  I was monitoring the 
CB and knew they were on their way, having picked up their 
chatter as they crested Pine Pass nearly 90 miles away, 
although none of them heard my transmissions until
they reached Chetwynd, about twenty miles from Moberly Lake. 
Throughout the trip I would be able to hear their transmissions
considerably farther than they could hear mine.  

When the convoy arrived at the lake I used the radio to lead them
to my campsite.  They filled up the surrounding sites and began
to party.  There was a flurry of introductions as I met people
known only thru the internet.  In the dark I was unable to fasten
names to faces or faces to buses and was still trying to do so
nearly a month later.  Then someone needed to borrow my grease
gun, someone else borrowed my ax and another asked might I happen
to have a pair of vise grips... a pattern of post-campsite
arrival that was to persist throughout the trip. -rsh
