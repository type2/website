So it appears that Mark's figure was pretty correct...  Remeber he said
average, not exact.  I would estimate my investment so far is about $6,000
and my Crew cab is not what I would consider daily driver yet.  Based on
what other people on the list have said, that extra $725 can get eaten up
awfully fast in repair parts like a new clutch, master cylinder, pop-top
canvas or NOS anything.   So my experience has kind of balanced yours out.
Heck, my tarp and bows alone will cost me more than $1,000!
