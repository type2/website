&gt;A quick check/looksee just now shows that although the inside diameter is
&gt;the same, the biggest difference is in the outer groove where the backing
&gt;plates mate to it (backing plates for 80-91 Vanagon and 71-79 Buses are
&gt;differently shaped [not much, but just enough for a difference]).  In
&gt;addition, the groove on the outer lip is larger by a few 16ths of an inch on
&gt;the Vanagon drum to account for this difference.  Looking at them side by
&gt;side, I would speculate that you *could* use Vanagon drums on the Bus, but
&gt;not vise-versa due to the design differences stated above.

Great info Jim. So my next question: does the Vanagon backing plate has fitment issues on the baywindow bus?

&gt;FWIW, ATE Drums for both models are now being made in Italy, ATE shifting
&gt;all of their production from Germany in the past year or so.  There is
&gt;another brand, OMC, but I haven't seen these.

I've noticed several vensors selling those now.
