Subject: Short Baja Story (Bus-Related)

Hello Out There --
In temporary lieu of my delayed work on a Baja trip report of some kind, I
thought I'd pass along my only real roadside repair story of the trip in my
79.  Actually (and somewhat fortunately) it occurred in Angel's Camp, CA on
the return trip north, rather than south of the border.  After checking out
an interesting thrift store on a pretty warm day, I went to start her up
and got nothing; no clicking, no labored cranking, nothing (although
everything electrical seemed OK).  After an attempted push start (with the
volunteered help of the 60+ year-old proprietor of the store) went
unsuccessful, I whipped out the Idiot Book but didn't find much quickly.  I
then remembered -- from my continuous pre-trip research -- several mentions
on the list of people with similar hot start problems who had gotten
positive results from whacking their starters.  So, I grabbed my hammer and
crawled underneath, found the starter, and lightly knocked on it a few
times just for the hell of it.  Hopped back in, and she fired right up! 
Moral of the story:  Remember those little fixes you read about on the
list, as you will undoubtedly need to conjure up those memories somewhere
down the line....  My only other problem occurred in La Paz -- I discovered
a scary fuel leak at the rear left side after being overfilled at a Pemex
station.  (My co-traveler claimed that her 77 does the same thing at the
exact same place -- this isn't normal, is it?)  Although it didn't reoccur
after making sure my tank never again got filled past the first nozzle
shut-off, I plan to do a full-on fuel line inspection ASAP.  Anyway, just
FYI.
