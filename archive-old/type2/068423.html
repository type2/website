&gt; So you worldwide net community, here's the question:  Does your horn work, and what is it for?

My horn certainly works, at least 25% of the time. I use it rarely, and
then only to signal friends seen on the road. Naturally, not being mice,
they do not hear it anyway. As for drivng transgressions committed by
others or myself, I prefer careful driving and patience over noise,
whenever possible.
