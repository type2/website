Subject: coming home?

Hey, I'm looking for people with good info. While i was working in knox, TN. I bought a 1973 type2 transporter off an older fella. This is my first VW and has been a dream of mine for quite some time now. The bus was in fairly good shape but hasn't been ran for three years. I tinkered with it and came up with these problems to date. First, it has an automatic transmission, when it runs through the gears, I have 1st,2nd, gear but when in drive the trans. goes into 3rd gear for a second then back down to 2nd and back up again. I read a letter sent in that referred the person to a vacum modulator. It also talked about the vacum box. the vacum line was rerouted to the carb straight to the tranny. There is a black vacum box but nothing is going to it. 2nd, the bus has a bendix dual stage single carb. It was in pieces so i had to get a rebuild kit and put it back together. It will allow the bus to idle but when you press the gas pedal it stutters until the second stage carb opens up. Any reasons why? 3rd the drivers side brake caliper and brake line is missing. There is just a rubber line with threads attached to the frame. I need to locate these parts, but where?  I don't have the money to rent a hauler and tow it so i am trying to get the items together so i can maybe drive here( Richmond va.) about 400 miles. Any advice would be greatly helpful. Thanks jeremy
