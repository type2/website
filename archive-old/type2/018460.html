Hi Volks,

Just another reminder about the Lowcountry Bus Festival sponsored by the Full
Moon Bus Club in Charleston, SC.  The campout is between Walterboro and
Charleston and not very far from I-26 or I-95.
The date is June 25, 26 &amp; 27.  No facilities or hook-ups, but we will have a
port-o-let.  Private land, door prizes, day trip to the Edisto River for
swimming.
For more info:

updated daily for more info.
If you have any questions please email me at waitejj_at_musc_dot_edu.

Peace

Snoopy
