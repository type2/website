Subject: D-Jet vs L-Jet

Does any one know the difference between D-Jet and L-Jet fuel injection?
I really don't need a highly technical explanation, but just a basic
difference.  I believe my '77 westy has L-Jet which has worked fine so
far.  When I was a kid my father had all kinds of trouble with his 
squareback trying to keep the D-Jet (I believe) FI alive.  When I told him the
bus I bought was Fuel injected he figured it was the same system as the
squareback had and that I was in for a lot of trouble (had me real worried).
Well in any case,  What is the difference?  Which is better?  Is L-jet
a just a more modern version of D-Jet?
Thanks,
Brett
