&gt; First of all, why have the case align bored?  According to what I've read,
&gt; type IV cases almost never need it.  If you did everything else listed
&gt; above *except* for the counterweighted crank I would expect 100k+ miles
&gt; from the engine (except for possibly the cylinder heads).  

I took the two Vanagon engines I'm rebuilding to AVP for machine work.  
Leonard said that he now routinely align bores all the type IV cases he 
works on because of the high accumulated miles on these engines.  As a 
rough and ready test of whether the cases I had needed to be align bored 
he took a new #3 bearing (the round on trapped behind the timing gear on 
the crank) and pressed it into each of the saddles in the case.  Because 
of the built-in &quot;crush&quot; the case provides, pushing the bearing into the 
saddle should take a certain amount of effort, and the case should &quot;grip&quot; 
the bearing, requiring a significant &quot;tug&quot; to free it.  In the instance 
of the two cases I brought in, almost no effort was required to fit and 
remove the bearing from the saddles; Leonard recommended align boring the 
cases since the dowels in the case were doing most of the work of keeping 
the bearings from spinning.
