Subject: Odd Oil Pump Pics

Here are some pics of the Pump I spoke of earlier.

This one is of the SUPER 1500

http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/forum/album_page.php?pic_id=91672

Here are more with some comparison pics with a normal pump.

Any ideas of the origin of this pump? The only markings I found were the 
&quot;SUPER 1500&quot;.

Thanks,
