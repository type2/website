Subject: need good used 091 transmission

My mechanic feels that my 1982 Aircooled Vanagon's transmission is &quot;fixin'
to die&quot; and suggests that I lay hands on a good used transmission for when
the inevitable happens. ANyone out there with a line on one that could help
me out?  I need a 091 4 speed transmission.
