Subject: Accel Cable Blues!

--part1_34.1ee3b348.293d457e_boundary

okay, I've got a 76 automatic, and the accel cable broke, apparently the 
cable links to some kind of linkage on the automatic transmission, it is 
broken between there and the pedal, so I pulled out the old cable, and now I 
can't figure out how to remove the part by the transmission, I'm sick of 
busting my knuckles on it, and there seems to be no help in the bently on it, 
so someone please tell me the trick! I have not even looked at the front 
yet...Yikes
