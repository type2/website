Subject: RE: [T2] The ramifications of high crankcase pressure

I have this same oil leak all though not as bad (I probably go through an
extra quart per 1000 miles) but all the same symptoms/oil locations Gregg
mentioned.

My compression test shows 150PSI all around..

So if my compression tests are all this good and I still have this same leak

So what else could/would cause this high crank case pressure thing??????
