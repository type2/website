Subject: Re: [T2] Shift rod extension

&gt; Anyone have an easy fix for a 69 Westy shift rod to make it longer?
&gt; 
&gt; I do not have simian arms, and since I drive with the seat pushed all
&gt; the way back, I have to sort of lean forward every time I shift.
&gt; 
&gt; There must be something that can be screwed on...where the shift knob
&gt; currently is.
&gt; 
&gt; Thoughts?
&gt;    
   There's an aftermarket shift extension that I've had for many years...
chrome and bent to both heighten and bring the shifter further back.
It's tapped to screw onto the shifter rod (with a lock nut) and the other
end is threaded to accept the original shift knob...Or, you could do like
I did and tap a glass and brass door knob (after someone stole my or-
riginal Shlitz bar tap... ;-(
