Subject: fussen an fixen

I will be pullin das bus into the garage for awhile to do
some needed work. To make room for this I need to find a
home for my 50's era craftsman table saw. It runs fine ,
has all the fences etc. Its pretty accurate. built like a
tank. asking $50.oo. if you are in the Seattle area it
would be a good deal.
  One of the projects is fixen the sunroof. Replacing the
cables. Problem at the moment is it is stuck.  Anyone
having advice on how to get it opened without breaking
something I would love to hear from you. Yes I have looked
at the archives too.

TIA, Dan
