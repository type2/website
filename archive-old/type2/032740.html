Subject: Re: Stock offset (was Fwd:  Re: merc wheels)

I've asked these questions before but did not yet get an answer that will
put my curiosity to rest:

Q1. What determines the optimal offset from an engineering point of view?
Q2. How much of a deviation from that optimum can be considered acceptable?
Q3. Why did VW change the offset when they put 6&quot; alloys on their Vanagon?

Actually, I did get nice, geometry-based (though not applied) answers to Q1
and Q2 from Doktor &quot;DM&quot; Tim, but I cannot yet reconciliate them with Q3.

I'd like to get the theory right before I order adapters for my 6J15 Fuchs
wheels.
