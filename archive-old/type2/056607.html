Subject: RE:  Tire SIPING

&gt;the guy is telling me about this new process they have called &quot;SIPING&quot; 
&gt;as in they want to SIPE your tires, $10 per tire. sipe is apparently
the 
&gt;name of the guy who came up with the process. there's a special 
&gt;machine that does it, and what they do is run your tire through the 
&gt;machine, and it cuts some very fine diagonal lines through the tread, 

NOT!!!  Don't let them do this!  

Each tire manufacturer spends lots of time and money researching the
various tread designs and matching the tire's construction to it.  If an
additional longitudinal cut in the tire's tread would make it a better
tire, you can well believe the manufacturer would have built it into the
design in the first place.

My guess is that this would actually void the manufacturer's warranty.

No proof-positive info, just good common sense.
