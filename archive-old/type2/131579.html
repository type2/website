Subject: RE: [T2] Ebrake keeps popping in.............how to fix? 76 bus

Hi Adam,

It sounds like the ratchet mechanism on the E-brake handle is slipping.  
Look under the dash to be sure, but there should be good teeth on the top of 
the rod that attaches to the handle.  If any of them are worn or rounded 
over, they will be unable to grip the ratchet and the handle will slide back 
in.  If this is the case, try re-adjusting the E-brake cables so the bad 
spot is before or after the engagement point.

Hope this helps....
Good Luck!
