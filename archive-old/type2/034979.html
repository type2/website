Subject: seat mounting hardware

Hi all,

     I am looking for some seat mounting hardware.  I need 3 or 4 sets of
the t-bolt, anchor &amp; nut that holds down the middle &amp; back seats of my 79
bus.  I believe that any from 71-79 would work.  If anyone has these, then
please let me know &amp; I will pay what is needed, plus shipping to Portland,
OR.  I have not been able to find them here.  Thanks.
