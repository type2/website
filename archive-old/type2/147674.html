Subject: piston/crank/rod combinations

Hi Volks,

I am in the process of planning a rebuild of a 2.0 air-cooled in an '80
Westy.  It belongs to a friend, and there are a number of things on the
to-do list.  Re-installing the FI (has a carb now), and probably building a
stroker are the two top priorities.  I have built other engines in the past,
but am not sure what rod/stroke/piston combinations are advised,
discouraged, etc on the air cooled boxer.  Any help you can provide would be
greatly appreciated.
