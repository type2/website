Subject: Re: [T2] Possum

Mine's called SuperBus! because it was able to pass all the other cars
on the freeway..

...and then we overheated the engine putting a hole in the piston

.........but it's still called SuperBus! anyways :)

&gt; &gt; Seeing all these busses with names on the list I started thinking about one
&gt; &gt; for mine. I wasn't having much luck until last night. I worked late and got

&gt; &gt; trashing my office. Finally the animal control women shows up, she says aww
&gt; &gt; he's just a little one, grabs him by the tail and walks out of my house
&gt; &gt; carrying the sucker by his tail. My girl doesn't think we should name the
&gt; &gt; bus Possum but I'm thinkin I'll at least call the engine that. Any
&gt; &gt; thoughts?
&gt; 
&gt; wait til you get it on the road, the bus will tell you it's name,
&gt; eventually.

&gt; &amp; JOAT the 78 bus, that took it good old time telling me what it's name
&gt; was, still not sure if it's male or female, but tend to lean to &quot;she&quot;
