Subject: [T2] Looking for the listee who want my bus .dxf

I'm working with a listee who is collecting digital bus art.   I sent him a
.dwg (AutoCAD file) of the A.I.R.S. logo for the Auburn Hills show poster,
but that didn't import well, so now I'm going to try a .dxf version.  But my
PC at work, with the file available to it, got email whacked over the
weekend, and I've lost your address.  So, if the shoe fits, please ask
again, and I'll send the file.
