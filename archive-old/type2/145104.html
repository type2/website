Subject: Re: [T2] Living out of a Bus on the road with Kids

Hi All.  Just back from my cruise.  Great time!  
  
  Interesting thread.  It could be done.  When I was in  Honolulu, there was an article about a woman who lived in a couple of  tents on the beach somewhere in Oahu.  She'd been there twelve  years and raised two small children.  They went to public school  but came back to the tents after school.  There are no regulations  against it and Hawaiian beaches are all public property.  They are  thinking of changing the laws. If they do, she'll have to relocate  every two weeks.  
  
   That wouldn't be much different than living in a bus with a tent  attached, awning, and camping amenities.  In fact, I'd be inclined  to try it.  But don't sell your house until you do it for a  while.  Cheers...KR
