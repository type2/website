Subject: RE: [T2] My Battery Fell Out...Help!!!!

If you have the money, time and love, the best thing to do is cut out the
cancer, find a donor bus and have a good body shop weld the piece in.  Of
course, this all depends on the work you are willing to put in, the amount
of rust in the tray area and the condition of the rest of the bus.

&gt; Hello list members,
&gt;
&gt;     I discovered that my passenger side battery on my 77 westy has fallen
&gt; through the floor. Fortunately, it is holding on by a small piece
&gt; of metal. I
&gt; looked at the replacement battery trays _at_BusDepot. Is that the
&gt; best way to go?
&gt; And what is involved in installing the new tray? Any help would be greatly
&gt; appreciated, i did not see anything on this topic in the library. Thanks
&gt;
