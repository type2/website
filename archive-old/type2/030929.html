ain't that the honest truth, and I got my first VW in 1967!!!!!!

I would say in the passed mummmuumble mumble years I have probably found
more different ways to break my Vw than I care to think about.  (but I
keep finding new ones ;8*{.....)

&gt; So Daniel, drive the thing until it dies. Be prepared to do a complete 
&gt; rebuild. It will cost you around $1500 if you do it yourself, more if 

stay away from GEX (or other crate engines)  if you don't do it yourself,
find someone who will let you watch or help.  even if you never do it you
will have a much better understanding of what is going on inside that box

&gt; someone else does it. Note carefully how the bus feels when it siezes up. 
&gt; You won't do that again.
