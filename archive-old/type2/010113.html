Subject: 72 won't start--more...
Message-ID: &lt;19990712182816.18880.rocketmail_at_web205.mail.yahoo_dot_com&gt;

brief recap: 72 westy wouldn't start after driving from acoma to Salem: good
samaritan got it started at rest stop, i played with a wire at camp ground and it
started again--but engine was cool by then, so ..., wouldn't start again after
driving half way home, couldn't do anything with any wires or etc., to get it
started, and then:

It started this morning--must be a &quot;hot engine won't start&quot; problem. 

I called my local repair shop--he said it sounded like a &quot;heat soak problem&quot; and
that the starter is getting so hot that it needs more voltage to work: suggested
that a &quot;relay&quot; might help or that it might need a new starter:

cost of relay:  $50 plus $60 or so for labor
cost of starter:  $250 all together ($100 or so for labor).

First, does his diagnosis sound right?
Second, are his prices reasonable?
Third, how hard would it be to do this myself?
4th:  any other Suggestions????????

going to the redwoods in 2 weeks so have to fix asap!!

Thanks,

Dale G
