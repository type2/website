Subject: 71 for sale

It is with great sorrow that I find I need to sell my 71 Weekender (and
restored 74 beetle for that matter). My bus is driven daily, all the bugs
worked out mechanically. Lots of new stuff like tires, brakes, battery, seat
covers, CV joints, recently tuned and runnin' good. It's ugly, needs paint.
In western NC.
I gotta have $1800 or trade for a 4x4 truck of equal value. Contact me at
work email above or 828-433-2760.   Clark
