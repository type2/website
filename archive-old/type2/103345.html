Subject: Re: [T2] sliding door rot.

Hi Alan,
You're right, that's one of the common rust sites. Along with under the 
windsheild, under the front floormats and along the slider track.

It isn't just the salt, think about the road debris getting thrown up 
by the passenger side tire. Since the P/S tire is always at the 
curbside, it's more likely to be throwing sand, rocks and water up at 
the frame at high velocity. Ouch.

Happy trails,

&gt; Hi,
&gt; I am wondering why our busses always have rot start on the lower right 
&gt; hand
&gt; side at the bottom of the sliding door?
&gt; This is where it is on mine and so many others I have seen.
&gt; And yes, I do know it is likely due to exposure to salt. ;-)
