Subject: Pilot bearings
Date: Sun, 29 Nov 1998 08:05:33 PST

I have been reading the replies to Chris and his bearing problem.
On 1.7, 1.8, and 2.0L engines the bearing goes into the end of the 
crankshaft, not the flywheel.
Under the 5 bolts that holds the flywheel on is a flat plate. The center 
hole is not large enough to remove the bearing. The 5 bolts and plate 
have to be removed. Removing the flywheel then gives you more working 
room. The inner lip of the bearing is very thin and hard to grasp with a 
pilot bearing removing slide hammer. When my bearing went south I ended 
up screwing in a 5/8ths [I think] fine thread grade 8 bolt til it 
bottomed out. Then it started to push the bearing out until it 'lost' 
it's bite. I then used a large slide hammer with a hook on the end to 
pull it all the way out, hooking the head of the bolt.
