Subject: Re: [T2] Sunroof in a Bay westy bus

I saw a website that detailed the process on a Vanagon Westy, though  
for the life of me I can't find it again...

Here's what they did....  Cut out for the aftermarket sunroof in the  
same place as the stock 'vent' is located.  Trimmed off a piece of  
the cutout material to use as fillers for where the rib is on the  
poptop and glassed them in.  Set the new sunroof in place and screwed  
it down.  Looks like a good weekend project. (And one that I will  
undertake soon.)

&gt; Hi Timo,
&gt;
&gt; I guess I wasn't very clear in my earlier post.  I don't want a  
&gt; sunroof in the luggage rack, and I don't want to replace my pop- 
&gt; top. I was thinking about installing a skylight into the fiberglass  
&gt; of the westy roof. My Dad's 85 westy has a small clear vent in this  
&gt; location, and the 82 westy my parents had before that has a larger  
&gt; webasto sunroof installed in the pop-top. The extra light and  
&gt; ventilation are a definite plus.
