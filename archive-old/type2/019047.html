Volks:
I'm in need of some intallation help.
Particulars:
Rebuilt 1600 in 71 Westy
Full flow
VDO oil pressure and temp gauges
Bus sitting for 8 years

Finally got the engine in and wired.  Installed the gauges today, using
the windshield wiper wiring as my keyed + for the gauges.  While turning
the engine over with the points disconnected from the coil, the oil
pressure was not comming up.  After 45 seconds of cranking gauge reads
approx. 8 PSI.  BUT, neither the gen or oil light were on.  I don't want
to start the engine without oil pressure.  The dual sender is marked &quot;G&quot;
and &quot;WK&quot;.  I'm assuming &quot;G&quot; means gauge.  I even reinstalled the factory
sender and still no lites.
What's going on here? Do I start the engine with only 8 PSI?

Thanks
Shawn Clark
71 Westy
