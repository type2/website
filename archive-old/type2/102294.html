&gt; Scott, that was a little confusing, but after visiting a local shop here
&gt; that specializes in camper bus's he concurred that the vacuum retard should
&gt; come from the plenum. I checked a few vehicles in his yard and they all had
&gt; different looking plenums but the retard all came from there and not the
&gt; intake side of the throttle plate. I'm not concerned with exactly where the
&gt; nipple should be as long as I know where the vacuum is supposed to come
&gt; from. I will just Tee into the line that is coming out of the Plenum (air
&gt; distributor) already.

&gt; Thanks everybody for directing me to all the excellent links, and offering
&gt; so much help.

I found this in the archives regarding vacuum advance/retard:

http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/type2/009292.html

Another listmember described the retard connection on that setup as
connecting via 4-way tee instead of 3-way with the plenum/regulator/decel
valve.
