Subject: Re: [T2] 71 fuel pump

quick question, on a 71 -1600 dp- fuel pump, does the gas enter the pump
&gt; &gt; through the bottom nipple or top nipple?

I think it may depend on what fuel pump you have.....I have a cheapie throw 
away Brazilian fuel pump and fuel goes through the nipple on the side and 
get pumped to the top nipple and into the carb.
