Subject: RE: [T2] tail light probs

Chris,
	Just be sure to mark everything.  About a year ago I made the
mistake of pulling my dash board out because I had a short and the
wiring was messy.  I did not mark any of the wires before disconnecting
them from the fuse box.  This was where I screwed up.  Even with the
Bentley and other resources I could not put it back together myself and
ended up paying a full $1000 to get it put back together.  Yes, I have
learned my lesson.  :)  What saved me was a few pictures from a very
helpful member here in the list.  I received these only after the shop
spent many man hours on the vehicle that I still had to pay for.  Mark
everything, take lots of notes, and read a lot about what you are going
to do, and you should be ok.  Good luck.

Subject: [T2] tail light probs


Hi Class...have a problem i need some help out on. 
when i turn my headlights on, my brake lights come on. 
when my headlights are off my tail lights work fine. turn signals and
brake lights work fine. but when i turn my headlights on. the brake
lights come on and stay on. so i can't see my turn signals or my brake
lights of course. 
any ideas? do i have a cross or short wire somewhere? duh.
i have another short, i believe, in my fuel/warning guages also. but as
long as i don't mess around with the wires under my dash that short
doesn't seem to be a problem at the moment. something that i will
definately be lookin into tho, when i get off of the road. anyways..any
help u can pass my way would be much appreciated. thanks in advance, and
a gr8ful peace out to all of u wonderful vwheads.
