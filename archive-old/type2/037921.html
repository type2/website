Subject: extract sink, insert seat

what i can gather from the archives, some type II models were outfitted
with a rear-facing seat - placed behind the driver. has anyone the best
method for fashioning something similar for my jan'75 campmobile? my
sink/storage unit has been out for a while, and i hope to replace it with a
volks seat.

being in the market for one, i am hoping to hear offers for seats/hardware
west of the cascades and no_dot_california. upholstery not important.
