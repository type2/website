Subject: Re: [T2] Charging problems?

Rogelio,

One real problem with ammeters is that since all the current for the bus
has to pass thru them, 10 gauge wire is pretty much mandatory with 8 being
preferred.  And let me tell you... handling 8 gauge wire is... err....
difficult!  Much of what you describe sounds pretty normal, but it is
possible that the measuring device (the meter) and its wiring are
interfering with the measurment, as the esteemed Mr. Watson has pointed
out.  The VR is pretty sensitive to voltage drops and increased resistance
and may be behaving badly because of your ammeter.

Unless you suspect an amperage-related problem, a voltmeter may be a
better full-time guide to the state of your charging system (and it will
be *much* easier to install.
