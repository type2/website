David,
I am not 100% sure on how the Pertronix operates but as I recall it is a
Hall effect type dealie with a magnet and sensor, magnet attaching to the
distributor shaft and sensor sitting where the points used to.

I can think of a couple possibilities here.  First involves the Pertronix
itself.  I would suspect that perhaps the magnet on the shaft is slipping or
interfering with something (maybe hitting something) as it rotates on the
shaft, so that it is being displaced gradually and eventually gets displaced
so far that the timing is noticeably out of whack and the engine no longer
runs right.  You adjust it by turning the distributor body so you get it
back into the correct position but then the interference is still there so
it happens again.  You should be able to verify this by turning the engine
over by hand with the distributor cap off and seeing what if anything is
interfering.

Other possibility is that the distributor clamp bolt is not doing its job
and is not holding the distributor body firmly in place.  This should be
able to be verified easily as you would be able to turn the distributor body
by hand without first loosening the clamp bolt if this is the case.  This
would normally be my first inkling but given your description I don't quite
think this is what's happening, largely because you woulda figured that out
by now I think.  I mean, that would be the first thing I'd check.

I guess some further possibility could be assigned to sticking advance
weights (no vacuum weirdness on an 009, just a simple centrifugal advance)
but given the fact that it's a new distributor I wouldn't put this high on
the list.  Still, a possibility.

I don't think there's a problem with the Pertronix unit per se, I mean it
seems to be functioning correctly in that it's counting the impulses from
the magnet as it passes the sensor and breaking the coil's primary circuit
appropriately, but it seems that the time at which it's happening is
changing, which would indicate to me that if the Pertronix is at all at
fault, that magnet has gotta be moving around on the shaft.  It's exactly
the same as if you rotated the distributor body to adjust the timing, what
you are doing is rotating the entire distributor (incl. points on a normal
system or Pertronix on your system) around the shaft, which rotates
independently of the distributor body -- by doing this you change the time
(in deg. BTDC or ATDC) at which the spark arrives at the plug.  If the
Pertronix magnet is slipping on the shaft, it's essentially doing the same
thing except the other way around -- it's effectively rotating the SHAFT as
it relates to the distributor body, which will change the timing in exactly
the same way.

I guess there is always the possibility too of a whacked out distributor
drive gear but that being the most invasive thing to diagnose (and not the
most likely I think), save that one until the other possibilities are ruled
out.

&gt; Here's the trouble: I set the timing according to the reccommendation of
7.5
&gt; BTDC. It leapt to life on the first try! After a hundred miles or so it
&gt; wasn't running so well; checked the timing and it was at about TDC. Reset
&gt; the timing to spec, drove some miles, timing now at 16 BTDC. Long story
&gt; short, every 50 miles or so the timing has to be adjusted--usually
advanced.
&gt;
&gt; Assuming the engine was assembled properly by AVP and that the new 009 is
up
&gt; to snuff, then the question is: has anyone else had trouble with the
&gt; Pertronix Ignition? If I go back to points, can I use the Pertronix coil?
(3
&gt; ohm) Or should I use the stock coil?
