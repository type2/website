Subject: RE: [T2] Unknown Timing

&gt; No, Bob.  The moral of the story is that if you time to the block, not the
&gt; distributor, it can cause you to severely overheat the engine.


I'll second that.  More than one Type 4 engine has been severely overheated
because the owner had an 009 distributor and timed it to the specs printed
for the engine (which originally had a vacuum-advance distributor with a
completely different advance curve). You must set timing based on the
distributor that you are using, not to the engine.
