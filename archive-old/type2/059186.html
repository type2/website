Subject: interior panels

so if a set of interior panels is like $1000.00 and then shipping for
someone like my in canada is another $??? - isnt it possible to just get
the vinyl and make my own panels- isnt the vinyl just stuck on with
contact cement and staples?? - does anyone know from where i can get
repro VW interiour vinyl - my 60 had the green and brown interior
combination - and i already have found the plastic chrome like stuff -
would seem to my that if i can get the repro vinyl i could make my
interior panels for next to nothing
