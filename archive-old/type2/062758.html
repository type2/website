Subject: Import/Export of VW's

&lt;&lt;  Oh heck, &lt;snip&gt; says &quot;to Hell with it&quot;, lets export all of them to Japan
 and forget about it all together. What do y'all think?  &gt;&gt;

Not intended as a flame to ANYONE, anywhere, anytime, etc.  BUT, I have heard
it said several times (more in person than on the list) how you are &quot;selling
out - whoring out - killing the hobby - etc.&quot; if you sell your Vdub to the
Japanese.  My question is, how exactly is this any different than when
Europeans sell their bugs &amp; busses to folks here in the states?  Why is it
okay for Americans to buy offshore but it isn't for anyone else?  I am
discomforted by the double standard that exists here.  VW nuts are VW nuts
regardless of thier country of origin.  Am I alone on this?

Comments?
