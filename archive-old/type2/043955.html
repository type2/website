Volks- Yesterday I removed an oil gallery plug, tapped the hole and
inserted a 3/8 inch NPT plug. I started the bus up just an hour or so ago
and NO OIL LEAK!  Dr. Tim had me worried that I would throw a rod or
something if I didn't get all of the metal shavings out, but so far, so
good. I cleaned it out as well as I possibly could without dropping the
engine and flushing the entire lubrication passages out. Anyway, all
that's left is for my new pushrod and pushrod tube to come from Bus Depot
(they must have gotten hit by a rock or something, because they are bent-
yes, I know that there is a piece of tin that is supposed to cover the
pushrod tubes. I have recently acquired it and will install it after my
new pushrod and tube come), and for a fellow list member from South
Carolina to send me a filler tube (thanks, Chris).  I'm so excited to
actually be done with the bus.
