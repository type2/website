Subject: Re: [T2] VWoA and Trademark Troubles

thanks, i was thinking the same thing. i never intend to make money on
it, although i had hoped to make kids' shirts a few years ago cuz there
just arent enough available... but that was when i first started hearing
about this whole mess and decided against it. the tire cover, however, i
am making for my own personal use, so i dont see a problem with it.

thanks again, and i agree with reasonable actions, but they do seem a bit
overboard at times,
chris 
70 westy soon to have a cover for it's spare tire!

&gt; *shouldn't* be a violation if you don't sell it.
