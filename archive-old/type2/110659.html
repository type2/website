Subject: oil leak found..

Ever since a rebuild 2000 miles ago, (2 liter) I have had a small leak.  It appeared to be coming from the fan pully seal, oil sender or maybe the cooler itself.  When I did an oil/filter change yesterday I also removed the fan and started the engine to see if it was the seal.  I found the leak and it is coming from the top oil galley plug (the one that is for the oil filter adapter)I have heard that you can remove the plug and tap it with a 3/8 pipe plug, as is  done when full flowing a type 1 case.  Sounds like a lot of work.  The plug is still in there and is tight, just doesn't make a tight seal.  Any other suggestions to stop this annoying leak? thanks, paul.
