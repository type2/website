I HAD a chilton for my VW bus and my Chev. S-10.  Both chiltons 
weren't worth recycling into cheap toilet paper!!

&gt; I have always found that multiple manuals are best, and Bentley, Muir,
&gt; Haynes, and Clymer (if you can get it) are all good references.

Haynes isn't (usually!) too bad.  It depends on who wrote it on which
make/model/year.

My personal favorite is the &quot;Official Service Manual Type 2 1968
through 1978, Station Wagon/Bus&quot;
