Subject: Re: where I live

Oh, my, well I've been resisting, but I have had so much fun reading
everone else's responses that I suppose it is time to expose myself (and a
wonderful example of the maxim &quot;most people look better with their
clothes *on*&quot; he is, too, volks :-)

Where I live: Alexandria, VA, just south of Washington, DC

What I drive: the *other* hard-top, non-qualifying '76 Westy on this list
              in addition, I own (but am willing to sell) a '73 pop-top
              Westy, with a '78 FI'ed engine in it.

What I have named them: '76 - the white one
                        '73 - the orange one

(Don't worry, volks, I am also in no danger of writing &quot;The Great American
Novel&quot;, either) 

What I used to drive: (and still regret losing) a '78 seibsitzer,
                      blue/white and perfect in every way.

Occupation: Management Asst, Bureau of Economic Analysis, Dept of Commerce
            aka: govt. scut

Age:  Well, amazingly not as old as I thought.  I had always figured
      myself an old fart at 42, but find myself pleasantly in the (well,
      alright, at the high end of the) middle range of the group.
