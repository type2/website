&gt;not sure if there is enough room to come all the way back, you may have to
&gt;tilt a little (I have an automatic slightly different pull out) some
&gt;people swear by dropping the tranny rear a little but I do it the same as
&gt;you have planned.

There is not enough room to simply pull the engine straight back unless you
remove the oil tube as Bob mentioned, and in addition the exhaust,
alternator, fan shroud, and rear tin.  Not worth it IMO.  Dropping the
engine and tranny together is the most dignified way to do it.
