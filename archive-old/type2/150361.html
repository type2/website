Subject: RE: [T2] Mythbusters european car

Shame really. My old lecturer, Harris Mann, at university in Birmingham (UK)
was the chief designer at Rover then - he was the guy behind the classics
that are TR7 and the Allegro. He showed us renders of the concepts and they
were truly good looking vehicles - it was just cost-cutting exercises that
led to them being less of a car than they could have been :( I still like
the TR7...same goes for the Fiat - very similar - not sure which one would
rust first though in English rain ;)
