&gt; Additives won't do it.  For one thing, they don't contain tetra-ethyl

seat

&gt; seat material; they counted on this 'cushion'.  Engines that run
unleaded

hardened

If you really want to get some lead for your valve seats, it is as
close as your local airport.  Head on out there with a gas can and get
a few gallons of 100 octane av-gas.  This stuff has quite a lot of
lead in it, even compared to the old leaded autogas.  Even the &quot;100LL&quot;
low lead avgas has plenty of lead in it!

Put a quart or so of the avgas in your tank every time you fill it up
and you will have sufficient lead to lubricate the valves.

That being said, it is unlikely that you will ever need this
information.  Hardened seats are just about universal.  The only time
you would have to add lead is if you've discovered a barndoor with
50km on it that was stored in a warehouse somewhere.  For us normal
volk, we all have hardened seats whether we realize it or not.
