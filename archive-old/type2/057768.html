Subject: Re: Electrical Weirdness

Mike,

When the windshield leaked on my 72 I commonly got water on the fuse panel
down by the driver's left knee. Exploration discovered that sitting water
was leaving dissolved mineral deposits on the contacts of the panel. So I
disconnected the battery, removed all the fuses, cleaned all the contacts
up with a brass toothbrush, cleaned the fuse ends with same, and stuck it
all back together.

I aso found that the fuses were beginning to distort and warp just because
of the current that had been flowing through them all these years. So I got
a complete set of replacement fuses and changed them all out.

I have also found that oddities in some of the bulbs and bulb connections
can cause electrical weirdness in places other than the effected bulb. So
now I make it a practice to just replace all the little extrnal lighting
bulbs (not the headlights, but everything else) every couple of years.
Replacing them all at one time helps clean the contacts, and makes it less
likely that you will loose a signal lamp or brake lamp and not know about
it.

The result is that I very rarely have to deal with the surprise of a blown
fuse or surprise electrical oddities. That leaves me free to concentrate on
other surprises.

&gt;Yesterday morning, I went out to start my 73 Westy for the first time
&gt;after a 4&quot; rainfall on Saturday.  I've got a pretty bad leak at my
&gt;windshield and every heavy rain gets things pretty wet under my dash,
&gt;but its been dry and 95 degrees here for 2 full days now since the rain.
&gt;I just
&gt;don't know how it repaired itself.  I turned on every electrical
&gt;accessory in there including brake lights and defunct rear window
&gt;defrogger.  No problem.  Just got in to work after having driven the bus
&gt;for 20 miles and again, no problem.  Any ideas??
