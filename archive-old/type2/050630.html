Subject: [T2] Gas Heater Parts

&gt;&gt;I just purchased a plug from Ark last week  ( have yet to receive it). 
&gt;&gt;Looks like he knows what he's doing.

Whatever you do, don't deal w/ Gordon Hayman of Hayman Motors in Canada. 
He's listed on the Espar page as a recommended dealer, but I just got off 
the phone w/ him and he tried to charge me $170 US (before tax and whatever 
it would cost to send back to me) to fix what was apparently a simple wiring 
problem. When I told him that seemed high, he hung up, saying he would send 
&quot;put the heater back the way it was&quot; and send it back to me. We'll see comes 
back.
