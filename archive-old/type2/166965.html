Subject: Re: [T2] Battery Light Doesn't go off

Cool. I know the wire to the VR were there and hooked up properly. THe
alternator itself was shot so I'm guessing that could have been it to begin
with. It just surprised me that even with the key out the light stayed on.
I'll have to check the wire to the starter whenb I put the new alternator
in.

Getting that alternator out was a bit of a job and and a good learning
experience for a new bay owner.

&gt; &gt; On the '78 the battery light doesn't go off - even with the key out of
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; ignition.
&gt;
&gt; it sounds like the alternator wire isn't hooked up to the starter
&gt; solenoid.  trace the wires from the alt to the VR as well as from the
&gt; alt to the starter.  that is where i would start.
