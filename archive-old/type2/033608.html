&gt; &gt;I live in a condo and have no access to work space for this type of

&gt; It seems to me that either way your looking at between a couple of weeks and 
&gt; a couple of months.  Now you can buy an engine from APV, but your still 
&gt; going to have to remove and dismantle your engine--right down to the core.  
&gt; Then you have to mantle the engine (with new gaskets, etc.) and install it, 
&gt; 
&gt; Problem: You need (1)transportation while your bus gets fixed and (2) some 
&gt; place to work on your bus.

I have a similar problem, although I have a garage it is small and the bus
won't fit, it is full of VW parts anywho.   but what I have done is pick
up a spare &quot;junkyard&quot; engine, complete, no it doesn't run worth beans and
needs rebuilding itself, but it keeps my daily driver on the road when the
&quot;main&quot; engine needs more than a one or two day work on.  I can swap em now
in a couple hours (too dang much practice there)
  I keep telling myself that as soon as I get some time I'm gonna rebuild
that old engine but,  manna'
