Subject: RE: [T2] Missing cooling tin piece

&gt;From: Don Tuleja &lt;
&gt;Someone stole a piece of tin off my bus (!). How much risk do I run
&gt;driving without it?

&gt;Here's the piece info from the Bus Boys diagrams:
&gt;W. 021-119-356CU Warm Air Duct, Lower Right, Used 1972 to 1974, 1980
&gt;to 1983 All
&gt;It seems that I should be able to live without it for the time it
&gt;takes to get one, but I'm hesitant to second guess the engineers...



I have been looking for these pieces(both sides) for a few weeks. I still 
have not found them.

Facts from the list if they are:

They help push air to the back of the bus.
They are needed.
They are stone guards for the pushrod tubes.
They are not needed(written by someone who uses J-tubes.


And various other reasons.

Good luck, if you find any let me know I am still looking.
