Subject: Disconnect Thermo-Time Switch?

Hola amigos,

I was reading in my Idiot's Guide (top of page 164) where the late Saint
Muir says he always disconnects the &quot;temperature switch&quot; because his car
always starts in cold weather without it and because of his belief that
dumping raw gas into the engine is bad for it.

I was wondering how many other people do this and if it works.  Am I right
in assuming that Muir's &quot;temperature switch&quot; is the thermo-time switch?

Thanks for your help,
