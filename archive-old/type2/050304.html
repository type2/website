Subject: RE: [T2] who had the shocks?/split cv boots

&gt; who was it that was selling the brand name(oem?) shocks in the no name
&gt; package cheap to list members? still available?



That might have been me. I have Boge original-equipment shocks for Bus thru
'79, front or rear, for $16.95 each. These are the _exact_ same shocks sold
under the Boge name (made by Boge/Mexico, same as the Boge boxed ones). The
fact that they are identical comes straight from the horse's mouth (Boge
themselves said so). Only difference is that these are boxed under the
Technum brand name.  This is a brand name that Boge was using for some
overseas markets, and has discontinued in favor of using the Boge name in
these markets as well.  Because I got them in the Technum packaging they are
about 40% off.  You can order at 1-866-BUS-DEPOT or on the website (go to
the Bargains page).
