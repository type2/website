Ha!   Done it !

My patience has paid off.   Yesterday I purchased a 1970 (?) Devon for
£2000.   
And why do I feel so good about it ?  Because it is entirely original and
has NEVER BEEN WELDED ! 
Even the battery tray is intact,  everything...   (In the UK this is just
amazing.)  

Okay, so it desperately needs a good coat of paint - 
it's that gorgeous traditional VW colour &quot;Dove Blue&quot; - always looks so good
on ancient VWs nicht wahr ?
But after 30 years it is very dull and a little powdery.

It has an interior, but it's not actually fitted inside the bus at present,
since the PO had taken the wooden floor panelling out to replace it.

It has a VEGE recon 1600-single-port fitted (how old, I don't know)  -
behind one of those lovely bolt-on rear valences.

Also, it has drums all round !  - on a 1970 ?    Does that sound right to
you ?  
The registration document says it was first registered on 8th June 1970 -
but what model year is it really ???  - I'll check the chassis number
tonight.

So, this evening I'm going to collect it, and after that I've obviously got
a few things to sort out:
	1) Replace the fuel hoses !
	2) Fit new floor panelling (will ordinary household floor panelling
do the job ???)
	3) Put the interior fittings back in  - including some seatbelts.
	4) Oil change &amp; valves etc...
	5) Get it resprayed (original colour of course)  - (but where ?)
(BobWallace - can you recommend anyone in our area ? - I'm in Cardiff)
	6) Possibly change the front brakes to disks ???
	7) Drive it !!!

Thanks for your help and advice everyone !!!
