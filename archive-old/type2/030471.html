Subject: Solex-Brosol H32-34 PSIT-3 carbs....

(no, no D) (posted to typ3 because i have a feeling these carbs may have
been found on some t3's by now...some reason i think they are a
&quot;universal&quot; replacement for the 32 PDSIT as well as the 34 PDSIT..)


Just installed a 1.8 AVP in a freinds 73 bus...i had previously assumed
the carbs were the stock 34 PDSIT's on it...he got it with a blown engine
(#2 intake head came off..total gonner)

Other then the cracked exhaust stud boss (and mangled threads on
another..) the engine is decent....

Found out why eric (who's bus it is)had problems getting a carb kit to
work.

Anyway.  Does anyone know anything about these carbs? They appear to have
only two adjustment points.  the throttle stop screws, and what i guess is
the idle mix screw.  there IS an adjustment for the choke fast idle stop,
but thats it, other then linkage.

they are identical carbs, each with a single vacuum outlet.

Suggestions on adjustment? On syncronizing?

Also, we obtained a stock late bus dualcarb aircleaner setup...only to
find it does not fit. major setback being that it needs to be around 3
inches wider overall.  if it were wider, i oculd make it work.  Bus came
with no aircleaners.

Are we stuck using crap'n'chromies?  Cannot afford K&amp;N tall ones...hell,
at this point we cannot afford cheapos either.

any advise anyone has about these carbs, including the availablility of
rebuild kits that DO fit them, let me know.;)

thanks much....david
