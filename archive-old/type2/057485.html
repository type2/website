Hi guys..

Has anyone ever tried to install a Rabbit VDO oil temperature gauge and
sender into an upright VW engine?  I plan on doing that to my `63 Camper
with a SP 1600.  I have a good working gauge and sender out of a `79
rabbit...I am told with a T-fitting I can install the Rabbit sender at
the stock idiot oil light....

Any Comments??? positives or negatives about doing this????anyone done
it??

The gauge is in Celcius and not Farenheit..anyone have a conversion
factor??
