Subject: Re: [T2] its different for dome lights

Craig,
I have a 71 camper so it might be fitted differently than 70 Neunsitzer, but
anyways.

Front dome has 3 positions : ON with doors open, OFF, ON

Rear dome is way bigger than front dome and has ON/OFF. Switch is on the
dome.

I have a doubt though because there is also this switch on the dash (on the
right of the steering wheel. leftmost button) that I believe is supposed to
turn on one of these domes. My switch is broken and I dunno if it was
supposed to control dome front or dome back.

- Arnaud
