that part number  211-723-555 is correct for the AUTOMATIC only 76+
the manual transmission accel part number is 211-723-555AA, the manual
tranny cable is 3458mm long, while the auto tranny cable is 2870mm long.


I have not checked with Ron, lately, before he was unable to get em, RMMW
now has em listed but at $21.95  while the manual tranny cable is $5.95

&gt; &gt; &gt; I got mine at Bus Depot. $5.95 I think. It doesn't matter if it's auto or

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; oh yes, it is a very different cable, it connects to the tranny, and a
&gt; &gt; link runs from there to the accelerator.
&gt; &gt;    it is quite a bit shorter than any other accelerator cable, I have the
&gt; &gt; part # written in my Bentley, will get it out of the van tommorrow and
&gt; &gt; post it.
