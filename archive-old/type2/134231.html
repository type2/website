Subject: 1973 1.7 fuel injected ???

Bought a 1973 westy recently, knowing it needed major motor work. I thought
1973 should be 1.7 with dual carbs. This one has been converted to Webber
progressive set up. But when taking motor apart I noticed on the outboard side
of each inlet port where capped studs ( about 10 mm) that screwed into case.
They appear to be abandoned Fuel injector housings. Head part # is
021.101.371Q and my parts list shows it should read 021.101.351Q. There is
also a stamped # 381. Since 1.7 's didn&quot;t have F.I., I suspected  it might be
a 1.8 or 2.0. But when I measured the bore its of a 1.7. Could these be Porche
914 heads ? Would that be a good thing or a bad thing??? Thanks
