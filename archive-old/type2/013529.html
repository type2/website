The standard VW oil switch comes on around 5 psi, the
VDO switch around 10 psi.  What do you think would
satisfy most owners if their oil warning light comes
on at hot idle the first time they run their $2K plus
rebuild?  Will they be satisfied by hearing that the
shop rebuilds hundreds of T4s and they're like
Porsches and don't need any oil pressure at idle?

If so, these owners must believe the VDO oil switch
people have it all wrong and should be setting the
limits much closer to zero psi.  On the other hand, if
owners believe the VDO gage people are building their
oil switches to reflect the danger point (10 psi),
then they won't be satisfied unless a rebuilder
guarantees the oil light won't come on.  If the
biggest East Coast engine rebuilder can't guarantee
the oil light won't come on, it seems to me he needs
some competition.
