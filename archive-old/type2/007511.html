Subject: exhaust needed
Date: Sat, 31 Oct 1998 06:35:01 PST

Hey Y'all,
   I need an extractor exhaust system for a 1600dp. It will go into the 
Bus, but i'm told that one for a bug will work also. I don't need the 
muffler part, but will take it if its useable. I will pay cash or trade 
for other Bug/Bus parts that I have. I need one fairly soon. I'm in the 
NW so keep that in mind. Shipping is not out of the question, but might 
make it to expensive. I don't care if it ugly, just functional.
 Thanks
