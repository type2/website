Hi Adam
Too bad you can't make it to Niagara Falls CANADA for June 22
You realize that you can't see the falls from the USA side,
ah,, better change your vacation and see the Best side of the Falls! ;-)

You could camp out at Buses By the Falls

For fishing you can search this website,
http://www.grandriver.on_dot_ca/fishing/fishingarea.cfm?name=Byng
My Son caught a 32&quot; pike last year,, by hand,,, he didn't want the Bears showing
him up!

I live on that river,, about 80 miles north west.. you could have a fine trip
following the Grand River from the mouth to my place,,
just leave a few days to get here,, cause there is a lot of places you'll want
to stop to do nothing! Relax, set a spell ,

&gt; I do not want to venture too far into Canada, maybe a hundred  miles or a
&gt; little more, but looking for peace and quiet, maybe a little fishing for
&gt; Northern Pike, etc.   Any one with recommendations and/or personal
&gt; experiences would be helpful.
