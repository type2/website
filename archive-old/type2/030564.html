Actually,

The adhesive isnt water solulable.... the water you use acts as a thin
lubricating film so you can move the tint around a bit until you get it
where you want, then you squegee the water out to make it stick.

If the glue were water solulable, when you squeegeed the water out you'd
take a lot of glue with it.

Acetone works great for removing most residues... but its somewhat
nasty.  Couldnt be too bad though, its whats in nail polish remover...

take care,

Steve
