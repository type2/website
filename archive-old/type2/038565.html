Subject: heads (was 79 hydraulic lifters)

Hi all,

     Well it seems to have come to me needing to get my heads rebuilt.  I
have been told by some of my local VW shops that the situation with Type IV
heads is hopeless.  There are no real guaranties about the rebuilt ones not
dropping seats.  My questions are this:

1.  AVP or Mark Stephens for replacement heads?
2.  Local machine shop will rebuild VW heads, do I go this route instead?
3.  Would you automatically do the rings on this engine? (30k miles).

     Thanks for the help.
