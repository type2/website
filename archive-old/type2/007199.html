Subject: RE: Horn Button won't come off?

I just took mine of recently. It's tricky. . . make sure that you are prying
up just the plastic and not the metal trim around the horn button. The metal
is held in with screws. The plastic button should come off pretty easy. You
can use a small screwdriver but you cannot really get under the edge. You
need to just get a purchase on it when prying, being careful not to scratch
the button any more than necessary.

Stock replacement wheels are scarce as hens teeth and generally very
deteriorated. Non-stock wheels are very expensive and require an adapter.
Rocky Mountain Motorworks has the best price I have seen on a restoration
kit. It's $29.50 (part number 88003).

&gt;Living in the heat of the southwest, the steering
&gt;wheel on my 75 bus is falling apart. Cracks and
&gt;chips everywhere! I was going to remove and
restore it using epoxy, but I can't seem to get
&gt;the horn button off. Seems to want so much pressure
&gt;to remove that it may break. Any Ideas?
I'm Beginning to think about trying to locate
&gt;another steering wheel and horn button before I
&gt;continue. Any thoughts on the cost?
