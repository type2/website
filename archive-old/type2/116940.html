Subject: re: Cooling air, gas heaters, and J tubes

John,
I've found after having a BN4 in my '69 Dormobile and my '71 Westy that I still 
use the fresh air heat system to defog the windshield.  
When its cool and raining, it's too warm to use the BN4 and when it's really 
cold you still need the air moving right at the windshield.
