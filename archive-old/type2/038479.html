I know.  I am just joking around.  I am going to go through my brakes this
weekend. I have a 71 Westy that has been sitting for ten years.  Should I
replace all my brake lines?  Or just bleed them and see what happens?  So
far, I hit the brakes and nothing happens (not good).  It runs just fine now
but I can't drive very well (or very long) with no brakes (the e-brake works
fine though).  Any suggestions welcome.  BTW, I have already replaced all
the vacuum assist lines.  I could not get a hose clamp on where the line
goes through the body, is that normal?  There was not one to begin with.
Ok, I am open for suggestions on brake refurbish...
