Subject: Can't remove distributor on 76 Westy

------=_NextPart_000_002C_01C21066.A55A6AB0
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hello All,

I'm trying to get my distributor out on my 76 Westy and although I've =
removed the clamp bolt from the engine (not the adjuster but the one =
that holds it down to the block) it still won't budge. Has anyone run =
into this problem? I don't see it mentioned in the archives although I =
may not have searched for the right words.

Bob
