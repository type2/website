&gt;A friend of mine has a 54 Deluxe that is very complete and has been in a

Well, I know one guy who bought a somewhat decent '55 deluxe, but needing
some bodywork and interior, for $9500.  

I know another fool who bought a really, really, REALLY, rusty '54 deluxe
for $7000.  I also know of someone who just sold a really nice '53 deluxe
for $25k.

The most important question here is: does he know what he has?  Is he even
remotely aware of its value?  What area in the country are ya?  Ya might get
away with $2000-$2500 or so, if he hasn't been exposed to the hype.  There
was a time when you couldn't _give_ barndoors away...

Oh, and when you say &quot;complete&quot; - does it have the vent trim?  Correct
middle seat with 6, not 4, legs?  Radio (swoon!)?
