Subject: Cutting out at high RPMs: '77 Bus

Tonight, our '77 Westy began cutting out once it was warmed up, and at
high RPMs.

I am quite familiar with &quot;Vanagon Syndrome&quot;, and since the FI system in a
'77 is not that too different from air (and even water) cooled Vanagons, I
am applying that same logic to solving this problem.

So, here is my proposed troubleshooting &quot;flowchart&quot; (in order of my
perceived importance):

1) Fuel filter (of course)
2) Water in fuel
3) Points, cap and rotor, etc.
4) ECU grounds/connections
5) AFM (but, it's not always at the same RPM, so I doubt it)

Any other suggestions?

Thanks,

Jon
