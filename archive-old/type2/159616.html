From what I've read she began studying acting at the American
Conservatory Theatre while pursuing an undergraduate degree in
mathematics and engineering. She was planning to transfer to California
Polytechnic Institute when she attended an open casting call.

I remember her repeat roles on &quot;MacGyver&quot; before &quot;Lois &amp; Clark&quot;...The
vintage VW probably appeals to her sense of efficient design and the
engineer in her....a geek at heart?  I could only hope.

At least she seems to have the means to keep it in good shape and isn't
beating around town in a banger like some of us.
