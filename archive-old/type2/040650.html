I have a great 71 bus for sale in Louisiana. $3900.00  This is one you get to enjoy from the start instead of it staring back at you in the drive way  while you are trying to get it to run. P mail if interested.

I know that an exhaust leak will cause a backfire, but I dont understand why. Can some one enlighten me?  Thanks     

Rick
