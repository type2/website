&lt;&lt; &gt;Every state (and presumably country) has procedures in place to clear
 &gt;the title for a vehicle that you possess legally.  There is no reason
 &gt;that I can think of to swap VIN plates unless the ownership of the
 &gt;vehicle is questionable.
 
 The only reason I can think of is if the vehicle you posess is not legal to
 drive in the US, like say a Mexican beetle or a Brazilian type II. &gt;&gt;
Or to make your vw smog exempt. In california 73 or earlier busses don't need
smog.
