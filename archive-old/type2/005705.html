&gt; hi: i got the tranny into neutral! now the serious stuff. two issues i
&gt; could use help with -
&gt; 1) fuel is now flowing through the pump to the carb, but the engine cuts
&gt; out as if it ran out of gas. i can get it going again if i fill the small
&gt; round tube at the top of the carb with fuel. it'll cut out at idle
quickly,
&gt; and with acceleration until the bit of fuel is burned.

Sounds like you need to remove the top of the carb and check the needle/seat
assembly.
It probably unscrewed out a bunch of turns...... retighten it.
