&gt; Im having problems starting. Its turning over, just not catching. When/If I
&gt; can get it started, it tries to die very soon after. If I manage to get it
&gt; going and drive for a while, it runs ok and doesnt try to stall.
&gt; The battery is has a good reading on the meter. The headlights dim (almost
&gt; go out) when trying to start.

Is it turning over quickly or quite slowly? if slowly it might also be
a good time to double check the connections at the starter and
battery. Aside from the vacuum leak Bob suggested it could also be a
double relay issue with the FI system. If the relay is not starting
your fuel pump when the key is turned to the start position and the
engine is turning slow enough to not open the AFM flapper the pump
will not pump.
