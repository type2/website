Subject: Initial Ignition Problems
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hey, list, here's my scenario. We finished a rebuild of a 2.0l FI for a
'78. The engine is installed and everything hosed and wired up correctly
(we think). We disconnected the coil-to-dist. center wire to crank the
engine and bring up the oil pressure. We cranked the engine for 20-30
seconds with no problem (the oil pressure light remained on) until a puff
of smoke and the smell of ozone from near the steering column ended our
attempts. Now when the key is turned nothing happens except a springy noise
when it goes to the start position. No fuses appear to be blown and the
accessories still work. Also the key is stuck in the ignition (probably a
separate problem). My questions are: What has happened happened to the
electrical system and how did it happen? What tests can I run to determine
the problem? Thanks,
C.D.
'78 Bus
