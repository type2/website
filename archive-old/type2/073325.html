&gt;I was giving my 73 camper the ole winter inspection the other night and
&gt;noticed my boots on both of my my lower ball joints

&gt;of information, and if I need to replace these things
&gt;I am going to order the torsion arms from Bus Boys. Thus my question how do
&gt;I know if I need to replace the current ball joints?
&gt;I drove my bus last in November and there were not any noises or clicking or
&gt;chunking sounds from the front end.
&gt;I also checked for play in the joints last night and did not see any.

How does your steering feel?  Ball joints play a part in that equation.  If
in doubt, you could take your bus into a shop and have them checked.  All
of my busses ball joint boots were split when I got it but I got by for
over ten years by periodically stuffing grease into the boot before I
finally replaced them.  I had it done by Meyers in Las Vegas - a first
class shop if you are anywhere nearby.  That was one job that I decided not
to tackle myself.
