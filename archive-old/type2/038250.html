Subject: Licence Plate Restoreration

Volks,
  Great Friday question, I just re-painted my '79 bus (orange and tan) looks
great excpet for the the orginal blue/yellow California License Plate.
According to DMV I am not allowed to resotre the plates but DMV also told me
that people do all the time. So I am looking for info. Looking for companies
that restore license plates and of course if anybody has done this please
give me your input. I have owned this bus since '79 my orginal plates so
this project is going to get done, just dont know when. Thanks everybody.
