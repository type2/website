&gt; My question: On a 1600CC Type 1 engine, can the fan shroud be removed 
&gt; so I
&gt; can see the cooler WITHOUT dropping the engine ? It looks fiddly but
&gt; dooable if I take the alternator out, but before I get stuck in I 
&gt; thought
&gt; there must be someone out there who has tried this. Incidentally, has
&gt; anyone got pictures online of doghouse &amp; non-doghouse coolers ? I'm not
&gt; entirely sure what I have and am now curoius, especially if I decide to
&gt; replace the cooler !

A friend who used to have a Karmann Ghia told me that he was able to 
pull the shroud and replace the cooler seals without dropping the 
engine.  But the caveat is that the Karmann Ghia's engine compartment 
is configured in a way to make this possible.  You might have just 
enough room in a Bus engine compartment to wiggle it out.
