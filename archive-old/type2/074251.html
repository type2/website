&gt;&gt;Gentlepersons- Anybody know of a site with plans for a DIY bead breaker 
&gt;&gt;(manual).

&gt;sure.  your favorite bottle or scissor jack, a board, a pair of gloves and 
&gt;goggles, and something heavy.

&gt;set the tire down, put the jack (and board, if you dont want to tear the 
&gt;rubber) on the side of the tire as close to the bead as possible, and run 
&gt;the jack up to your heavy object.

I respond:  Yep.  I tried this with a 3 ton bottle jack, between two 
young_close_growing trees.  Did not work.  The bottle jack gave up, and the 
trees bent.

I ask:  Does anyone have a 6-8 ton bottle jack and two strong trees I can 
borrow??  Hopefully, local; I could not afford the USPS costs.

I add:  TGIF
