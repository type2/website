This is a bit of a stretch of my memory but what isn't these days.

Many of the original &quot;Sermons&quot; date to a time when there was not a 
type2 list. They were in fact posted to the Vanagon list. After 
type2_dot_com was founded web space was devoted to &quot;The Sermons ....&quot; as 
a collection. The originals remained in the archives of Vanagon_dot_com. 
Some newer material was in the type2_dot_com archives. I do not know the 
break dates but Hoop might.  When the issue of intellectual property 
surfaced over a vanagon_dot_com archives CD for sale Hoover stuff was 
stripped  from the archives of vanagon_dot_com. The sermons remained 
around for a while but were taken off line at Bob's request around 
the time he left the type2 list. I am not sure but I think that was 
before the vintagebus split off  (no pun intended) from the type2 
list.

However, if you go to type2_dot_com, select archives, select vanagon 
(these files apparently are resident on the type2 server) do a search 
for Grendel. You might be surprised.  I even found Bob's posts from 
the Inuvik run. For the savvy and industrious Bob's stuff is out 
there  and it is worth finding.

&gt;I don't think this is entirely true. While some of Bob's sermons are still in
&gt;the type2 archives, the articles that are considered &quot;The Sermons of Bob
&gt;Hoover&quot; are for the most part, not there.
