Subject: Source for fabric? (Westy curtain butterscotch plaid)

Volks, 

Both my '67 and my '73 have one relict curtain (behind the suicide
cabinet) that is the original butterscotch plaid. Both are missing the
rest :-( Has anyone found a fabric that is even close to this pattern? Has
anyone got a set (or two? :-) boxed in their basement/garage that they
would like to sell?  Since I know that the '74's were different, the '73
ends the run in this fabric, but when did the run start?  I was very
surprised to see the match between late split and middle bay!
