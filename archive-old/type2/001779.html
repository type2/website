Hi, - I live on southern CT, and I've struck a tentative deal with my wife
to start looking for another bus, or parts bus for my 71 Westy, But I need
storage space badly.   We own a very small piece of property, and already
have my cherished che*y, and my westy in the garage, both only driven during
the summer, and not for sale. Outside, we keep my winter driver, and her
daily driver in the little driveway.  In about two years we will be looking
to move to a bigger house, and she supports me getting a big garage, or
maybe even a barn, so I can enjoy my hobby of collecting cars.  Sound
familiar?  The deal is, I can't wait two years, and we're trying to save
money, so she said - Here's the deal part - If you can find somewhere to
store one of your cars for free (or rediculously cheap), you can go right
ahead and look for another bus.  I think she's being fair, because we really
don't have room for another car, and I should be able to wait - but I just
can't.  I have a car cover that will cover my Monte or my little
winter-beater, so I wouldn't be totally against leaving them outside, it
just can't happen at my house.

 This deal was made at 12:00 last night, so I'm going to work today to try
and get leads, but thought I would try the list first, and being Friday, I'm
sure I'll get some interesting responses, and advice.

Thanks,
Don Johnson
