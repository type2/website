~ Says Kate ~ but still not as well as it did
before I replaced the spark plug wires the first time.**
It seemed to me that the bus was running pretty hot. I noticed that when I
got out after driving home on the freeway, it smelled hot-ish.**

  Same-o problem when first I brought my sick little Ramona home. Top speeds
of 30 mph on a freeway onramp. Lots and lots of burpy backfiring from her
toosh.
  Had TWO problems there; PO had put the wires on wrong and they were arcing,
and, most significantly, vacuum leaks!!
  Since you seem to have an extreme tenacity for parts replacing, mayhap you
should begin again, and start with a new set of Bosch wires and some vacuum
hose line. Rule out the leaks first. Das cheap fix.
