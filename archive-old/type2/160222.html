Subject: &quot;Pop&quot; in AFM when cranking engine, 78 Westy

  Hi,
     When cranking the engine, there is often a pop in the AFM just before it starts.  This does not appear to be ambient temperature related, and it can occur with either a warm or cold engine.  It can occur if the engine is shut off and started after a few seconds, or it it has not been started for several days.
     The pop happens about 70 percent of the time, but with no pattern or regularity.
     The same pop always occurs if the accelerator is slightly depressed when cranking the engine.
     My bus is a 78 Westy with the original FI  engine, and has 158,000 miles on it.  About 1000 miles ago, the following were replaced:  distributor cap, rotor, points, condenser, fuel filter;  checked dwell and timing, tested compression, tested fuel pressure and volume, and ran compression test.
     I checked the cold start valve for leakage, and it is OK.  I checked all of the vacuum hoses and connections, using Richards excellent diagrams, and they are OK.
     My bus starts and runs well, but I am concerned about the pop.  Any help would be apprediated.
