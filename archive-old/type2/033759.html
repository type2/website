Subject: Driving in the wind

HI, this is Beth - I hope this is not considered a frivolous question! 
Is there any way to make driving in the wind less terrifying?  We had
forty mile per hour winds here near Atlantic City the other night and I
thought my beloved bus and I were about to get blown off into the
ocean!  As for names, my kids call my bus the Beetle Bus, so that is its
name.  I truly love it, and as all my friends have said, it is very ME. 
It is so great to have this list to help me with all my bus needs.  Beth
D.  '78 green and white bus.
