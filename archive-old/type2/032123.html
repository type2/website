Hi, folks--

I'm THIS CLOSE to putting a VW de Mexico engine in my bus.  The price from
a dealer here in Portland OR [Discount Imports] is more than the price on
the beetlemex web page [http://www.beetlemex_dot_com], but only until you add
in shipping; then they're pretty much the same, and I like having it come 
&gt;from someone who'se front door I can sit in front of in case there's a
problem.

I've been over the Idiot's Guide and the archives on breaking in a new
engine, and I think I'm pretty squared away on that--oil, tune-up, etc.

Just wondering two things: 

[1] Is there any lore that might have fallen through the cracks while I
was looking at the data? This might be a good time for me to hear it.

[2] Did the list come to any consensus about driving during break-in?
Staying off the interstates; never, ever lubbing--I got those.  How about
2-3 hour non-interstate trips [moderate non-steady speeds, some starts and
stops, a few hills]?

Any advice is welcome.

thanks

Bill
