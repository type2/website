Subject: Wanted:'68-'71 pickup dbl/sgl cab

A friend of mine is looking for a '68-'71 doublecab or singlecab, pickup. 
Requirements:
- - No rust THRU or holes. surface rust OK but no major pitting or weak spots.
- -complete with all side/tail gates and all &quot;pickup only&quot; parts.
- -No major body damage-small dents OK
- -Used, but not abused
- -No bizarre custom body mods ( hacked out rear wheel wells are real scary)

If you have, or know of someone that does have, a pickup that meets the above
criteria, then please e-mail me .

thanks,
chris
