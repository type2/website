Subject: Re: studs

&gt;I don't know the length, but these are stepped studs.  The head side is 9mm
&gt;and the exhaust side is 8mm.
&gt;
&gt;You will find oversized studs in many of these engines.  These are 10mm on
&gt;the head side.

I'm not saying you're wrong, but many 72-79 heads (almost every one I've
seen) came with 8mmx8mm studs (non-stepped).  VW used the 8x9mm studs to
replace pulled studs - that's what they gave me when VW botched the install
of the LeCoz heat exchangers on my bus.  I didn't install them though - I
decided to go directly to 8x10mm studs instead.  I seem to remember the
length being about 2.75 inches but I'm not sure.

By the way, I took the right heat exchanger off of my bus a couple of weeks
ago.  It is a Dansk which I received as part of the LeCoz heat exchanger
swap thing a couple of years ago.  The flange for cylinder 2 was loose -
the welds holding it to the pipe had completely cracked off.  Cylinder 1's
flange was cracked but not loose yet.  Looking down the cylinder one pipe,
the flange piece is seriously mismatched with the pipe.  It is offset to
the side by about 3/16&quot; so that there is a ridge in the path of the
exhaust.  Probably not enough of a deterrent to flow to cause a problem,
but I am upset by the lack of quality.

Also, the right heat exchanger for some reason hangs down lower than the
left one.  Looking at the bus from the rear, the muffler is angled down to
the right.  I checked that the heater boxes are seating properly (they are)
and now I'm wondering if the tubes are simply longer on one side.

I've had so much trouble with the &quot;free&quot; heat exchangers that I'm starting
to wish I had never gotten them.  Between the fitment/alignment problems
and VW pulling the studs out of my heads and refusing to fix them, those
boxes have cost me considerable time and money.
