Subject: Re: [T2] Need Better Freeway Gears

Rick,

You've hit on the exact problem on the freeways.....

I absolutely *hate* being behing a truck or humongo SUV...even in my daily 
driver sedan....

The reason....

I can't see didly when behind someone in an overbuilt dodge ram 
1500000....all I can see is his rear end at 85mph....and when ya back off, 
then some 16 year old with no experience gets right in between us and 
rides the guy's bumper....as someone said...it's either 85mph or zero.

That's probably why people want *not* to be behind you...even at 85mph.

just ranting....done with it now.

Cheers, dave

&gt; The biggest issue seems to lane changes on interchange
&gt; ramps...the car behind me will see a bus, and try to
&gt; jump out around, blocking me from making the lane
&gt; change to get on or off that freeway.  The best
&gt; solution to this has been to anticipate the way their
&gt; little minds work, and beat them to the punch, so I do
&gt; those kind of lane changes as early as legally
&gt; possible.
