&gt; 
&gt; Late Bus thru Vanagon half shafts (axles) rebuilt......$99  ($25 core)
&gt; 
&gt; I've used these before on my A2's and find they have worked well + 
&gt; they have a lifetime warrantee..  New boots, rebuilt CVs on shafts 
&gt; ready to install with grease.  Their warrantee is generous.  I've 
&gt; replaced three sets of brake pads on my 89 Bronco II (400,000 miles) 
&gt; on this warrantee.

that seems to be a pretty good deal if you have a thrashed axle.  I wonder
if they would honor the warantee for a cracked boot or does the CV have to
be gone first?

The only bad thing would be that, with my luck, I would be on the road
when I needed a replacement.  A half-shaft is awfully bulky and heavy to
carry.  I normally carry a CV and a boot.
