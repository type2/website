Subject: re: idiot guide book for vw's

It sounds like you have a good mechanic helper.  In this case he may be right,
and if you can remove the parts yourself it will save half the cost.  As for
the book, I'll advise you that you'll get many different opinions on this.
Personally I've always gotten by with the Haynes Book and to some extent the
Official Bentley book, also.

I recently picked up the idiot book and found it to be really so-so.  I
suppose it could make an entertaining read, and maybe offer some good common
sense advice once in a while, but if you're somewhat mechanically inclined
then try to get the Bentley book, if possible.  Alternatively the Haynes books
are super cheap and can be picked up in any auto parts store.  They're not too
bad also, IMHO.

Best regards, and good luck.
Shawn.
