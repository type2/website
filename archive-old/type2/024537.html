Subject: Which engine for 73 westy?

&gt; Any bus with L-Jetronic should adjust very well to displacement changes, while
those &gt;with D-Jetronic would run lean with a larger than stock displacement.  I
can never &gt;remember which years came with which system.

I think the 75-83 Buses had the L-Jetronic, while Type 3 and perhaps type 4 cars
had the
d-Jetronic (like 67-73?) The D-Jetronic would come into play if you switched in
a 411 or
412 sedan motor into your bus and wanted to keep Fuel Injection. Would D-Jet
work in a bus?
Is anyone drivng one with this system? I rebuilt a 71 411 &quot;W&quot; code 1700 for my
73 bus and
it worked pretty good - It was powerful and spunky - but then I used a Holley
Bugspray carburator - didn't have the FI and put in an aftermarket american fuel
pump (beckarnsley?)
