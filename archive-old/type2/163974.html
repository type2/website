Why did you have to drag Dawn into this?

I'll be there.

Jason sez if'n he can't get Wyatt out of school early, he won't be 
passing through Knoxville until 8 PM Wednesday.

I would like to leave outta here in time to get there before dusk 
(sometime in the afternoon).

We'll see what shakes out.

I don't know if I want to see Dawn's crack ever again.

Chris

What's the perfect automobile?
Nothing more than you really need.
What it takes to get you where you want to go.
Volkswagen Type 2.
