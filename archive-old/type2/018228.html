No doubt it all depends on where you live--here in &quot;Hell&quot; aka Phoenix--i
burn 20/50 for the winter months---when hell gets here,  roughly from
May thru September i go to straight 50w--
But this is in regards to-a 63 bus with a 40hp--62 bug--71 Empi 4 door
Limo--67 bus-
all of these are single port engines and work just great and are driven
during the daytime.--My goal is not speed--all motors are stock or close
to it--so far in the 20+ years in Hell --the motors have done well--with
no breakdowns as of yet--also i use a higher octane gas--dog house
cooler--engine well sealed in the compartment--using just common sense
and the basics--the motor will hold up--Listen to your motor--if it
pings --STOP!! retard the spark a little--the dry heat of Arid-zona is a
real test--but there are a lot of daily driven 50s and 60s VWs in this
area
vintage vw?  drive um!!
