Volks,

I sent this to the list, but it never appeared there after nearly two days.  
Has the address changed along with the format?

&gt;Marv,

&gt;Ric Jablonski and I are due to pass the baton this weekend.  We are planning 
to &gt;meet somewhere between Roan Mountain and Knoxville.  I saw your post to 
the Type &gt;2 list, but I was unaware of any organized VW event in our neck of 
the woods this. &gt;weekend.

&gt;Here's the plan:   

&gt;Ric and I could rendezvous at the site of Chuckie's Redneck Campout in 
Cosby, TN.  &gt;Chuckie or no Chuckie, we could all congregate there and pay 
homage to the baton.  &gt;Pass this along to any folks over on your side of the 
continental divide and let's &gt;see how many people we can muster for this 
once-in-a-lifetime event!  Let me &gt;know.

&gt;Chris Slaymaker
&gt;Knoxville, TN

&gt;&quot;May the four winds blow you safely home&quot;
