I used flexible 1/8 plastic tubing on the front and rear sections and 1/8
copper tubing between the front and the engine, all connected with brass
junctions. Worked for 28k on my last bus. Have yet to install it in my new
bus, but it will be there. It's about 28th. on the list of 4,000 things that
need to be done. TBear
