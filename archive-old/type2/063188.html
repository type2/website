Subject: Results of &quot;75&quot; Westy Inspection

hey now,

okay, the elderly wife told me that this bus was a '75. however, on the
plate it is marked 8/76 with #237006533. could someone translate these
numbers and see what it means for me? the man said it was a '77. hmm. okay.

this bus is classic vw orange with greenish yellow upholstery. hmm, not my
favorite colors. inside looks good. nice carpet but i couldn't pull it up
to look at the rockers. riveted or glued really well. interior is complete
except the sink has been dismounted. i don't no if this had electric or
hand pumped but whatever it was is gone. interior was clean. has ac but
doesn't work. seats and cushions in great condition. passenger seat doesn't
swivel. i thought it should. what gives with that? track for the seat looked
like my '74. decent stereo. all windows there. some window rubber is cracked.
couldn't look at pop top because it's under a shelter. been sheltered for
past year. when asked what condition the popup canvas was in i was told
&quot;it's never leaked&quot;. car needs a good washing and the top needs some
serious scrubbing.

paint seems in good condition. some bubbling under front windshield. only
bad spot of rust is on rear passenger side near window. took a look under,
didn't crawl under because of massive spider webs &lt;YEEK! anyone who knows me
knows i get the heebie cheebies and freak out at spiders!!!!&gt;. did look at
engine. was rather dirty. i mean really dirty. couple of what looked like mice
nests. engine has layer of dirt on it.  seal looks okay. heater boxes rusted,
under the engine is a rather thick coating of oil/dirt...checked oil, oil
looked really old. tin was rusted and there was some rust inside the engine
compartment. specially the fan shroud. but all pieces where there. would take
awhile to clean up. don't know anything about fuel injection so i can't tell
you if anything was missing. cv boots looked 'ok' from what i could tell.
tie rods looked okay.

the engine was supposedly rebuilt around 100,000 miles and i believe it has
160,000 now. he says he has the paperwork.

i'm going to do a major inspection of it on sunday. compression, etc. a muir
checkup. it needs a new starter or solenoid. or, if i'm correct, it needs
just the contacts cleaned up. no spare battery. rinky dink regular battery.
new tires but they are not reinforced tires.

all in all, on a scale of 1-10, my first impression was a 6.5. but i think
they could be talked down from $1600. the more i think of it the more i want
to wait and find the westy that vibes with me. this is a nice van. i just can't
say more till i get it cranked and drive it a bit. my finances are not great
right now. otherwise i'd prolly jump on it. so, come sunday i'll know a
bit more.

if you are looking for a van, this might be a good one for you. it needs a
little love but it's nowhere near a clunker. i might still buy it. but if
anyone seriously is interested in buying it let me know and i'll send ya
the results of what i find.
