Subject: Dolan needs Diesel Dash

Say that subject 10 times quick.  OK our fearless listmeister is in need of
a dash pod/instruments out of an '82 or '83 diesel or '83 or '84
wasserleaking vanagon for installation in his right and proper '80 air
cooled.  Why one asks, cause I've just figured out the slickest way to use a
used FI head temp sensor, $10 in Radio Shack parts, and a little bit of luck
to use the stock coolant temp gage as an incredibly accurate, cheap, and
most importantly unobtrusive head temp gage.  Usefull range is 225-600F,
flashing warning light probably on around 400F though I have to work that
detail.  FWIW it has occured to me that it would be a joke likely in a bay
window to use the fuel gage with a little selector switch to multitask as a
temp gage as well, same $10 and a used head temp sensor.  Both of these are
just mA meters responding in the 50-150 mA range roughly.  Also a slick
conversion I'll probably roll for the '77 although one would have to keep in
mind which they were looking at and which you wanted to leave for normal
observation.  Anyway we need a Vanagon dash pod, with the BIG CLOCK, any
year as such should do, I had one but gave it away, and I figure somebody
may have one around.  Actually I we really need badly is the clock with the
temp and fuel gages and ideally the foil backing if you have a spare you
bought for only the speedometer.  After I roll this thing out, I'll post
details of the conversion.  FWIW the tach style dash could be retrofitted as
we already knew but it would take more than a bit of wiring, the clock style
drops right in.
