Subject: Bus Memorabilia

Hey guys,
 
    2 things.. the first is, I was at Borders book store yesterday, and I
came across this book in the automotive section. I just thought I'd list it
in case anyone had not heard about it. It was a small.. 100 page book I'd
guess called &quot;VW Bus&quot;. I forget the publisher (though I'll find out tonight
when I go home). The book basically went through the entire history of the
Volkswagen Transporter from the Splitty to the Vanagon. It then went into
detail about the Volkswagen Transporter the new one, and the weekender, and
the new forward cab show-car Bus of tomorrow. It also showed a bunch of
junkyard VW Bus pictures (which was kinda sad).
 
 
Second item, does ANYONE know where I can get a die cast model of a Bay
window Bus? Preferably, I would like to get one thats blue, a NON camper,
and a 73 or above.
 
 
Thanks,
