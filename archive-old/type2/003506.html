Any thoughts were to begin when your FI ('79) does not start?  This is =
what I do know.

1.  New battery.. 12V every place it should be.
2.  Fuel pump works when starter is engaged.

I plan on replacing the condenser and the coil.  If that doesn't work.. =
where next.

Thanks - Mike '79 9 passenger
