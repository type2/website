Subject: Re: [T2] Just Out of Curiosity

Don't know why but I can explain the circuit you would have the create 
using a $6 Radio Shack relay.

My guess would be that the rear window defroster doesn't care whether it 
gets 12 volts or 10 volts - it just won't melt the frost faster at 10 
volts. So VW used a slightly heavier duty switch and skipped the added 
complication of the relay. Probably cheaper when you consider assembly cost 
and materials.

Why would VW worry about the defroster relay when they didn't worry about 
heaters and sound proofing or sway bars? Amazing considering the original 
cost of the Westfalia which is much like the current Westfalia - expensive!!!

I didn't know that VW used a relay for the Beetle rear window defroster...

&gt;Hiya All,
&gt;
&gt;No earthshaking matter here, but I was wondering why VW did not install a
&gt;relay in Type 2s for the rear window defrosting grid?  And yet they did use a
&gt;relay for this same purpose in the Bug.  Seems to me that a relay would be
&gt;even more advisable in a Bus.  Anybody have any insight into this one?
