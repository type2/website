Strong suggestion: Stop driving the bus until you identify the cause and 
fix it.  It may be the steering box breaking loose from the front axle. 
Mine did this. Boxes tend to rust out internally and then break away from 
the axle. Some shops weld them, but many owners will replace the front axle 
at this point.

Some people are no longer alive, and their buses are in scrap yards after 
the wreck, because of these failures.

Anyone ever had this problem? This is the first time it's ever happened to
me, several times today, after I've taken a turn while in motion, my steering
wheel ends up in a different position when I'm going straight. It's VERY
noticeable. It ended up in three different positions before I got home today.
Any ideas before I tear into it?
TIA
