Can anyone recommend Bow-Wow VW in Lynnwood, WA for repair work?  I took my campmobile to a local guy because he said he's owned 2 buses &amp; knows repair (blah-blah). So I had him install a new alternator, he also did a tuneup (even though I told him not to, he did it in error, so I got it for free!).
Anyway, it seems my idle is slow, less power (all relative I know).  I warmed it up this morning &amp; kept stalling (after almost 10 minutes) &amp; then when re-starting it wouldn't turn over.  Would this be due to alternator, or timing, or both?

Since I'm a newbie &amp; am at the very beginning stages of learning, I'd like to make sure all is ok with the work the guy did very quickly, (hence having Bow-Wow check it out) as I'm leaving on a camping trip day after tomorrow--
Any recommendations?

Thanks!
