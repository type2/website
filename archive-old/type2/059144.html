Subject: Re: Recent thread on homemade exhaust analyzers?

[...]

&gt;Wasn't there a recent (in the last week or so) thread on homemade exhaust
&gt;analyzers on one or the other of the lists?
&gt;
&gt;I didn't pay much attention at the time, but I remember a comment
&gt;somebody posted regarding using the spring in the AFM to adjust the fuel
&gt;mixture at 3,000 rpm and the mixture screw to adjust the mixture at idle.
&gt;
&gt;I thought I'd go into the archives and re-read that post, but now I'm not
&gt;finding it in either the Vanagon or Type2 archives.
&gt;
&gt;Was it all a dream?

Stuff takes a while to show up in the (type2-vintagebus) searchable
archives, but it should all be accessible from the archive at egroups
within minutes of being posted:

The specific article on homebuilt oxygen meter setups was here:

	http://www.pelicanparts_dot_com/914/914tech_articles.htm

I don't recall the specific posting you're looking for, though, maybe it
was vanagon list only? Their archive is here:
