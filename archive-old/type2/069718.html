Subject: steering boxes

So rumour has it that there is no such thing as a new or rebuilt
steering box available, as the worm gears are no longer manufactured.
Is this indeed true?  Has anyone given any thought to talking a
machine shop into a limited production run?  The local parts place
says they end up rejecting about 90% of what comes in as too worn to
resell.  They've also got quite a stock of used boxes, if anyone does
show up that wants to do rebuilds.

All this comes up because my fourth steering box has died.  I'm going
through these things like most people go through tires, and it appears
to be mainly due to seal failure.  The current one leaks more oil than
the tranny, and the latter isn't exactly fluid-tight.  I *really* want
to put in a steering box that's got everything it's supposed to have,
with the original specs, and good seals.  So far, this is being a very
frustrating desire....

Suggestions?
