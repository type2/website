Dear Andrew.

Further to your recent question about crankshafts, I recall an article in 
the October/November 1997 issue of Flat-4 magazine about using the 1.9 or 
2.1 litre 1983-92 VW Type 2 water-boxer engine crankshafts, in air-cooled VW 
13/15/1600 VW Type 1, 2 &amp; 3 engines. VW are said to recommend a rev limit of 
5400 rpm, but the article reported it having been used at upto 6500 rpm 
without signs of fatigue in either the crankshaft or crankcase.

This crankshaft also has the 5 bolt fixing for the flywheel, with 215mm or 
228mm cluth, of the same pattern as the VW 17/18/2000 Type 2 &amp; 4 engine

Such a conversion is offered by :-
