Subject: Re: Petes 78t2

&gt;Ok Chris, here goes. A little history first. My wife and I were looking 
&gt;for a beater to drive back and forth to the beach.

Beah? Did you say beach??? &lt;grin&gt; I LOVE the beach. I MISS the beach!!! I 
am SO ready for spring... &lt;grin&gt; I haven't been to the beach for 10 years 
or more. Not since I was stationed in Orlando (Navy) in 1990-1991. This 
year I go to Florida!!!!

&gt;She surfs so what better beater than a VW bus. We bought it for 600 bucks, 
&gt;the interior was ok and complete, some body work is needed, but it ran. 
&gt;With the help of a bug fanatic friend of mine we rebuilt the engine. I 
&gt;think we did a pretty good job, my only regret is that he talked me out of 
&gt;replacing the crankshaft seal. Oh well one lesson learned, I'll deal with 
&gt;the oil leak. Any ways at that time I also put in a new starter, had the 
&gt;alternator rebuilt, replaced the plugs, plug wires, new coil, new cap, new 
&gt;rotor, new condenser, new points, replaced the front axle beam, put in new 
&gt;brakes and new CV joints, put in new exhaust halted all active rust, and 
&gt;really cleaned it up. The bus hadn't been on the road for 2 years when I 
&gt;bought it. Chris, this thing was now ready for the beach. Unfortunately it 
&gt;was February when I got it back on the road.

I'm still working on mine and it's been several years now...

&gt;      Initially there was some backfiring but it went away. It really 
&gt; drove great. There was more pep and power than I thought there would be. 
&gt; We were getting lots of peace signs and thumbs up. I was pretty proud, 
&gt; actually I think I was hooked. I started thinking about my next VW. Then 
&gt; gradually I started having more backfiring, loss of power and hard starts.

Okay.

&gt;      Here are the symptoms. Backfiring but not always on the same 
&gt; cylinder, hard starts both hot and cold. Sometimes I'll have it running 
&gt; great, perfect timing and RPM's. I'll come out the next day to start it 
&gt; and it will barely turn over, like the battery is dead. I've replaced the 
&gt; battery by the way. I can get it running again perfect, then it will 
&gt; start the backfiring again. I won't take it on the road again. We were at 
&gt; the Mall and it wouldn't start. My wife towed me home.

Okay.

&gt;      Here is what I've checked. fuel pressure, injectors, pressure 
&gt; regulator, cold start valve, auxiliary air regulator, temp sensors, 
&gt; intake air sensors, double relay. I've checked for vacuum leaks. The air 
&gt; intake boot had some cracks so I replaced it, that's when I found the 
&gt; refer. When I've had it running I've shaken both electrical and vacuum 
&gt; connections hoping to reproduce the backfiring conditions. I've even 
&gt; started disconnecting things to try to reproduce the backfiring. I guess 
&gt; I'm looking for that proverbial smoking gun. Cant find it. Now here's 
&gt; something I did find, and your going to roll your eyes. A couple of times 
&gt; when it wouldn't start I checked for spark from the coil. There wasn't 
&gt; any, but it wasn't consistent. Sometimes great spark sometimes none. The 
&gt; way I look at the coil is all good or all bad, no in between. And like I 
&gt; said sometimes it starts great and runs great. Anyway I ordered a new 
&gt; coil from Rocky Mountain, it should be here tomorrow. I know it will 
&gt; probably start and run but for some reason I think that there is a or 
&gt; some root causes still out there. The coil that I'm replacing hardly has 
&gt; any hours on it. Plus I'm still concerned about the hard starts. I've 
&gt; installed one of those hot start relays but still have my doubts.

Save the old coil. I think you'll find the same problems. Coils rarely go 
bad and they last FOREVER most of the time.

&gt;      What do you think? What am I missing. Am I crazy for pursuing this. 
&gt; Should I cut my losses and get rid of it? Help. Thanks, Pete.

When we got our bus I had similar problems. I pulled out all my tools and 
my books and started futzing with the injection. What I found days later 
was that the injection  was okay but that I had 4 or 5 vacuum leaks - 
serious ones.

First I removed the EGR valve and made a small metal plate that bolted on 
in it's place. My EGR valve was leaking and though it was only supposed to 
recirculate exhaust at part throttle (I think - check me) it was at all 
times. You may have to get sneaky and make a plug for inside the valve so 
it looks stock for the smog checks but is sealed off. I dunno how to get 
around the smog checks if you have them.

The second thing I found was many, many leaky injector seals. These are the 
seals that the injectors sit in and seal the injectors to the intake 
manifold. $16 from the local FLAPS at the time. Very easy to replace. 
Common to many European vehicles of the era like Volvos and BMW.

These two things made the bus run WAY, WAY, WAY better.

Next I replaced all of the gas tank hoses. My vent tubes (rubber) were 
broken and cracked. I replaced the filler neck - top and bottom pieces. I 
replaced all of the vacuum hoses that connect to the main black elbow 
between the throttle body and air meter. I removed the elbow and inspected 
it for cracks. I replaced the 2&quot; hoses that connect the intake manifold to 
the intake runners. I replaced the gaskets between the intake runners and 
heads. I sealed up all of the exhaust leaks.

I checked the tiny elbow between the aux air regulator (page 212 in the 
Haynes manual). Mine was loose and not connected properly.

I systematically went through the entire fuel injection system and checked 
every sensor and valve. That requires a vacuum pump ($25 or so for a 
Mity-Vac hand pump) and a multimeter ($25 for a basic digital multimeter).

At each stage I continued to drive the bus and note the tuning. Ultimately 
my problems were traced to timing, vacuum leaks (mostly injector seals), 
and a leaky EGR valve.

Check you timing with a light at idle and at 3000 rpm. That will tell you 
if it is advancing properly and far enough or too much. Make sure that you 
have the right distributor. I've tried Bosch 050 centrifugal advance dists. 
and 009 dists. The only one that worked right and smoothest and with most 
power was the stock vacuum advance model. If your bus has been &quot;worked 
over&quot; by the previous owner who knows what it's got. It could be that the 
advance is sticking. The timing light at 3000 rpm will tell.

EVERY VW I have ever owned was a collection of miss matched parts when I 
bought it. I spent the initial days checking to see what is missing and 
incorrect and locating the replacement parts.

Another thing to consider is the cam timing - is the cam gear and the crank 
gear timed right or could it be a tooth off?

I am wondering this: could you be fighting vacuum leaks and timing issues 
that cause a backfire causing the air meter flapper to get banged around 
and possibly stick in the idle position instructing the computer to reduce 
fuel flow to almost nil. This reduces your power to about nil (fuel-air 
mixture is all screwed up because it is supplying minimum fuel and your 
foot is on the floor opening the throttle to max and thus max air).

  Spark problems: run a momentary switch - simple push and hold switch to 
the under dash area. It can dangle. On one side connect it to the 12 volts 
+ On the other side piggyback it to the (+) side of the coil. If the coil 
will not spark push and hold this switch. I maybe that the start contact in 
the key switch is okay (or not - you mention starting problems) and the 
&quot;ignition on&quot; position is failing.

I had this very thing happen to my Beetle in Italy. If this switch was 
making poor contact internally and was causing the power to the injection 
and ignition to come and go while you drive down the road, it would first 
confuse the injection and 2nd cause the same symptoms you describe.

I can go down the rode on my old Honda motorcycle. If I simply turn off the 
ignition and then back on with the kill switch, tranny in gear so the motor 
continues to turn - the engine will back fire as the raw fuel that collects 
in the mufflers ignites. Don't do this like I did in a hunting area during 
hunting season. &lt;grin&gt;

As for the temporary switch up front you could add temporarily a toggle 
switch to represent the &quot;on&quot; position of the key (12 volts+ on one side, 
all the loads that the switch services on the other side), and a momentary 
switch to represent &quot;start&quot; and by pass the key switch completely for 
testing purposes. The details of which wires are in the Bentley. If you 
can't figure it out holler and I'll dig my Bentley out. The Haynes 
schematics are terrible copies so I don't use them.

Okay - there's my first attempt - bad switch contacts or timing/vacuum 
leaks. Eliminate the cheap stuff first. In the 5 years that we've had our 
bus we've never had an expensive part fail - just nickel and dime stuff. I 
had an opportunity to strip out a '78 fuel injection system and I keep a 
couple used spares on hand at all times. Makes troubleshooting easier too - 
just plug in an alternate sensor or meter or computer and see if that 
corrects your problems.

As for checking for vacuum leaks - use a propane torch (unlit) and put the 
propane gas around possible vacuum leaks. If the engine smooths out or 
idles faster you've found a leak. I've also used WD-40, brake cleaner, and 
carb cleaner. All are quite flammable so be careful. I like WD-40 because 
of the little red straw they provide to get the juice to the right places.

Okay. What do you think and holler back if you want to bounce some more 
ideas around. I'm interested in figuring this out too. Take care.
