Subject: AC/DC - was RE: [T2] Ham Radio and Bus Pilots

What are you going to do for the distribution block?  I've got some of
the Anderson Powerpole facias that I'd like to install near to the
battery charger plate (for accessories) but have run heavy cables from
the aux bat to the refrigerator's condensor box to power the rig and an
audio amp for the rear speakers.  My real project though is to integrate
&quot;shore power&quot; and a nice inverter to the 12VDC.  I'm wondering if it
would be worthwhile to ditch the OE transformer/rectifier for a modern
charger and separate power supply setup.  That is, a &quot;smart charger&quot; to
replace the wind-up clock mechanism and an Actron 40A or such to power
the auxiliary circuits when connected to AC.

I'm going to put my 706 in the Bopmobile when I get around to it.  I've
got the relay, some heavy gauge wire, a power distribution block, etc.
Now if I can find the time.  And the money for the deep cycle battery.
Then I'll try to figure out why my frig doesn't work.  Can't wait to be
chasing DX on CW at a campsite.  And field day!  73...KR  W4KHR - Ex

undergoing a major restoration at present, a few
years ago I started modding it for hf.

I had a local Porsche shop fabricate an adapter, of my own design, to
mate one of Shakespeare Military's Humvee brackets.  This in turn
mounts their 16' m120 hf antenna system, which is connected to an
IC-706MkIIg via a SG-231 coupler. (I have the complete 32' ground
mounted vertical system and use it to good effect with my ARES/RACES
group.)  I upgraded the auxiliary battery to an Exide deep
cycle/starting hybrid design and saw no trouble with voltage over
several hours of 100w operations.

Using this setup, I even worked 160m at a Field Day site 2 years ago!
Next on the Christmas list is Shakespeare's NVIS adapter :-)

Sadly, my Exide battery got toasted when I left the refrigerator on
overnight last year.  So add to my shopping list a low-voltage
disconnect and HD charging relay; that little Bosch 40A unit toasts real
quick when connected to a dead battery!
