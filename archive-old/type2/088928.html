Subject: Re: [T2] Tune Up Time:   Plug for Cylinder #2  (Arrrgh!)

&gt;  It took 1/2 an
&gt; hour reaching around the FI unit and dislodging vacuum hoses, an old
&gt; squirrel's nest and some other creatures.
&gt;
&gt; Anybody have any tricks for getting the plug back in in a case like
&gt; this?  My thought tonight after work was to try to go in underneath
&gt; after removing the right rear tire and jacking the car.   Muir had no
&gt; wisdom in the book, nor did Mr. Bentley.
&gt;
&gt; All ideas greatly appreciated!

What am I missing here?  You are doing this with the air cleaner in place?!?
Open engine hatch, remove right air tube from blower fan to tin tube.
Unhook latch holding air cleaner to support.
Remove engine cover.
Disconnect wire plug on AFM, disconnect vacuum hose to EEC purge valve on back
of air cleaner, disconnect hose to charcoal cannister.
Loosen screw clamp holding big S hose to AFM.
Lift air cleaner off support and remove out thru the engine hatch.
Takes all of two minutes and you have a straight shot to #2 plug.
