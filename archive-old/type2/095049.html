Subject: Disrtibutor Pertronix Problem I Think

I was driving the other night and my coil fell and I think shorted out I got 
another coil and for a while I was able to get a spark out of the wire 
coming out of the coil but not any of the wires coming off the distributor. 
Now there is no spark coming from the coil wire either. I have a pertronix 
pointless ignition and it smelled kind of burnt under the cap maybe just oil 
or something. I really need help with this because It was driving like a 
champ when all the sudden the car had no power all the lights were on and I 
pulled over and noticed the wires not attached to the coil since it fell. I 
have hooked everything up right I am sure and when I turn the ignition on 
the carb clicks. What should I check? I want to try all my options before I 
purchase a new pertronix ignition.

Casey
