Your mail to the type2 list has been intercepted and is being
returned to you because it appears to the list server to
contain an excessive amount of quoted material.

Brief quoting is fine, but please quote only for context.
Do not quote other messages in their entirety, or quote
message headers or signature files.  Especially do not quote 
the appended trailer!

&gt; Well for a couple of bucks most photo development shops will put any pic

getting the disk is no prob, my reg photo lab does it, BUT what I said and
many people do not get is &quot;This is a WORLD WIDE&quot; newsgroup.  many people
cannot or for one reason or another do not have a link that allows
graphics.  if you can't send it in PINE, UNIX, or LYNX it can't get there.
why do you think this as well as most newsgroups do not allow attachments
or graphics of any kind.

photos are no problem, getting them on or being able to see em on the web
is the problem.
