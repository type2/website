Second the motion on the starter bushing... As far as I'm concerned, one of the
most powerful motives for getting away from these marvelous machines was the
starter hassles.  One not only needed to travel with the tool kit in the back
but also to have partner ready to push.. or park on a hill..  The Bushing was
always one of the first things we checked...John Jensen in Annapolis.
