&gt;sorry,but no, the latch is different

Actually, you can: I did just that on my '56.  It only required slight
modification to the hole for the church key.  I used an early T-handle from
a rear hatch.  I used the original latch.  Later busses may be a different
story, but this works up until 65 or 66...
