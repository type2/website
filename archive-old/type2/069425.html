&gt; This happened all of a sudden? You may want to check the vacuum hoses

&gt; retard mechanism and only really kicks in at idle. 

You got me confussed hear. My books say the 75 has only one vacuum hose
- -- no vacuum return; spring return.


 
&gt; If this wasn't the problem, then check your timing. Since the engine idles
&gt; too fast, it will be difficult to accurately check timing per spec (5 ATDC
&gt; at 900 rpm), so do it statically, as per Muir: the bulb should go on at
&gt; about 7.5 BTDC (note that Muir's table says 0 deg., but that's wrong).

Static timing would be LESS than Dynamic because of the centrifical
advance built into the dist. Why would you advance it MUCH more than you
need. I can't find any comment from John accept to take it to VW, have
them time it dynamic and then check it static to find the correct static
point of timing. IMHO your advise is not well given; too much timing
will burnup your engine!!!!!

Have you set your timing at 7.5 btdc static and then checked it dynamic?
I'd love to see your results!!!

&gt; Hope this helps. Good luck! :)
