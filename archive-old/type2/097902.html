Subject: Re: [T2] Late model VW electronic ignition questions.

I don't know much about which coil is the correct replacement, but last week 
I ordered the bosch &quot;blue coil&quot;, it should be here today or monday. here's a 
picture:

Bus depot also sells a non-blue replacement, is that the one I should have
