&gt; HI All,
&gt; I was wondering if anyone can tell me what this part does,, and any idea
&gt; what value it is worth
&gt;
&gt; I know there is one on my 74 Bus, and I wanted to redo my brakes so they
&gt; might last another couple of decades, so it might be a good time to pick
&gt; this up?
&gt;
&gt; The vendor is not sure on the asking price, and I just wanted to be
&gt; fair,

That is the 'brake pressure regulator'. It is used on 71 and up buses [and
just about every vehicle with disc front/drum rear brakes]. It limits the
pressure to the rear brakes under hard braking to stop rear wheel lock-up.
Value?  I don't know.
Need to have? Very very rare to go bad.....
