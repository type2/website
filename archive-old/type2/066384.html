Subject: Re: Trip Report, Now it won't start!!!

&gt;I took my first extended trip this weekend, a trans-NY trip for =
midsemester
&gt;break.  It was extremely windy and sorta cold.  The bus &quot;ran&quot; great.  =
After
&gt;4 hours I stopped to refuel and the bus would not start (would not turn 
&gt;over).

Brett,

Long (hot) drives can cause a symptom known as hot soak. Basically =
this occurs when you turn the motor off, and the cooling fan isn=B9t =
running. The engine heat is transferred to the alternator/generator =
which in the case of a tired old alternator can cause it to fail. =
This is almost always a ground fault problem. The seemingly odd thing =
is that if you just sit and wait a while (let the alternator cool), =
the problem goes away. I've heard of people cooling their alternator =
down with a squirt bottle to get it going again.

I'd be interested in hearing from those that have actually done it as =
to whether or not pulling the end cap and subsequent cleaning of the =
alternator would or has made a difference in this symptom.
