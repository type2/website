Greetings All!

Here's the situation.......1970 Bus.  Present gas cap is a newer replacement 
but not, perhaps, appropriate.  Present cap is a VW/Audi vented cap with the 
number 343 201 561 (I think this is the part number.  It's kinda hard to see 
and this number is embossed into the rubber vent bladder in the cap).  
Whenever I go around a corner this thing spills gas like a sieve if the tank 
is anywhere near full.

So...............the question is:  What is the correct cap for a 1970 Bus?  
Anybody have a part number for me?  How about a description?  Any help at all 
on this one?

All of which reminds me to ask........... should the proper cap on this tank 
be vented?  I'm thinking that it should NOT be a vented cap (with the line to 
the E-Can and all).  And I do have a non-vented cap which will fit the 
opening.  But I don't want to put that non-venter on the tank IF this tank 
requires a vented cap.  What's the word from those in the know?

Mike
