I recall reading a few years ago, in the British VW Type 2 Owners' Club 
bi-monthly magazine (Transporter Talk), that the heat riser tube (i.e. 
inlet-manifold, exhaust preheat pipe) can be unblocked chemically, without 
having to resort to cutting or drilling holes.

The inlet manifold is first removed from the engine, an placed up-side-down 
in a suitable tray or bowl. The chemical solution is then poured into the 
exhaust preheat pipe and allowed to soak into and react with, the compacted 
carbon; topping-up as necessary.

For the moment, I cannot remember exactly which chemical is used, but I 
suspect it is a commonly available, domestic drain cleaner, such as 
sulphuric acid or caustic soda (i.e. sodium hydroxide). Hopefully, I shall 
be able to check the details, before my next e-mailing session on Friday!

I used caustic soda dissolved in boiling water, to clean all the internal 
steel components, of my air-cooled VW engine, which works extemely well.

Regards.

P.S.

Speaking of chemicals, do any of you folks use EDTA (i.e. ethylene diamine 
tetra acetic acid or its di-sodium salt), in your lead-acid starter 
batteries, to prolong their service lives, by inhibiting the sulphation 
process? We use it in ours, most of which typically last 6 to 8 years. The 
original one on my father's Ford Sierra XR4x4 lasted nearly 13 years.
