Howdy folks,

        I've got myself a problem, and without going into too much detail,
its got me down in a rather big way.  Maybe y'all could lend a little
advice.  I'll do my best not to drag on...


HISTORY:
        I had a 73 bus I did a top end rebuild on, it ran just fine, then
someone rear-ended me.  A year and a half ago, I bought a mostly decent 72
bus, and drove both buses down to corvalis (my wife Amelia and I actually).
I sold the body to a guy down there.  When I got to his place I pulled the
motor from the rear-ended 73, and returned home with the 72 and the engine I
&quot;top-end rebuilt&quot;.  I started an engine swap.  Type IV, 1800CC, dual
solexes.   I did lots, painted all the tin, the engine compartment, and all
sorts of stuff.  Now a year an a half later (I won't go into my year, it was
my bday yesterday, when I blew out the candles I wished for a better year.
If momey could only buy time...:), I finally drove the bus again.  It ran
like crap.  

PROBLEM:
        Among other things it seems it is not firing on 1 and 3.  Idle set
at 900, pull 2 or 4 spark plug wire and the idle drops to around 600.  Pull
1 and nothing.  Pull 3 and maybe a drop in 50RPMs.  So I let it sit
overnight, and I do a valve adjustment the next day.  Nothing is really that
far off.

        I check, seems 1 and 3 spark plugs are WAY loose.  Whoo-hoo I think,
I tighten them down.  No change.  I pull #3.  Kind of oily.  I pull #4 spark
plug, check the gap.  It is a little big, but I don't change it as it was
working fine for #4 cylinder.  I install #4's spark plug in cylinder #3, and
pull a plug from another bus I have sitting around and stick that in #4.
Fire it up, no change.  I swap plug wires between #2 and #3, no change.  

        Interesting thing here, is when I pull the plug wire for #3 the RPMS
drop about 50 or so.  When I hook it back up, the RPMS get up to about 1200
for maybe 5 seconds then drop back down to 900.  Over and over again I can
do this.  I am hoping this last tidbit jars something for somebody.

        I did not pull #3 spark plug again, as the engine is now real warm
and I loaned out my compression tester and anti-sieze.  If I stripped a
spark plug hole now, I'd sell the bus to the first person that came
along.  I'll get the compression tester and anti-sieze back hopefully
tomorrow.  When I do, I will run a compression test, but I doubt that is the
problem.  It ran great 1.5 years ago when I pulled the engine. I do not see
how sitting around could cause it to loose compression in two cylinders.   

        Any help would be appreciated.  I've got a couple more days to work
on it.  After that... I won't go there:)

thanks all,
        brandy


WARNING: SAPPY BUS STUFF:

P.S.  I've always regretted selling the 73 blue bus.  Named her UKY, so many
memories.  The couple we sold uky to were really great though, it was tons
of fun meeting them.  I've thought about them several times over the last
1.5 years, for many reasons.  They knew nothing about buses, he bought a
blown porsche engine he was going to rebuild an stick in there.  I kept in
contact via a friend of his that had email for a short time, seems uky was
to never run again.  It always made me sad.  Well, the day after I took my
first ride in the 72 (after 1.5 years) who should call, but Bob.  the guy I
sld uky to.  He had just gotten uky running, and took her on his first
overnighter.  He's been plugging away all this time, getting it to run.  It
made me really happy to hear that someone else would love that bus.  And
pretty sad that my bus ran so poorly.  But it made me go back out there and
do the valve adjustment, and the other little things I reported above.  Up
to that point, I wasn't sure what I was going to do.  Its a strange, small
world.  -bp
