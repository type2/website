Subject: Don's in Cali

Left around 1pm Saturday, got into Anaheim at 8pm last night. The Guac
FLEW! Better than the last couple trips, probably because I've finally
got the FI mixture dialed in (I think).

There are several automated speed checks on I-70 and I-15, and the
consensus is my speedo is 12mph optimistic at speed. So I averaged
about 80mph the way here (speedo pointing at the &quot;D&quot; in VDO). Hovering
around 4k rpm in 4th.

I had 2 failures though.

#1: I blew an oil seal somewhere. A small one, I'm losing a quart
every 200 miles.
#2: I blew an exhaust gasket or three. Sounds like straight pipes now.
I'm probably gonna get a ticket here in the OC for it before I leave.
Sigh.

I suspect both of those are caused by running at 4k rpm for long
periods of time. ;)
