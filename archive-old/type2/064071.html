Yes, *please* everyone, don't get this started.  We just went through a 
nasty bout of this on vintagvw which caused one of our favourite members 
to unsubscribe.  Such a pity cause he was such a great contributor to the 
'serv.  I understand some e-mails accidentally get posted from time to 
time, and I know there are those people who just *HAVE* to reply publicly 
to an offensive post, but keep the 'serv on topic and we'll all be better 
off.  I'm a firm believer in that problems should be ironed out by 
talking and conferring with one another - let's just keep that to the 
private e-mails.  

Thanks for your consideration and understanding as I really enjoy this 
group and would be sorely disappointed if anything bad happened to it.

Slater!
