Subject: Warning PLFVW

  I know that many of you have done business with PLFVW with excellent
results but I fear that, since her move to Arizona, Dawn has changed the way
she conducts business.
  It was because of the high recommendation PLFVW received from List Members
that I ordered curtains for my '71 camper van, from PLFVW, on Sept 9th of
this year.
As of this date I have not received my curtains nor my requested refund of
$172.
  Although the money order that I sent was cashed long ago, Dawn rarely
responded to my many e-mail inquires about the status of my order.  After
promised delivery dates came and went, I requested a refund and have not yet
received that either.
   I can understand that Dawn has had some personal problems in her life
recently, but cannot understand or excuse her lack of responsiveness to
those of us who have sent her money and who never received the product
they had paid for.  I am not the only list member in this &quot;sent my money -
never received my product&quot; situation.
  So List Members BEWARE, if you send your money to Dawn Smyth at PLFVW
there will be, in the best case, a very long time before you receive your
order.  In the worse case, you may never receive it and Dawn will not
respond to your telephone messages nor to your e-mail messages.  In my
case PLFVW has my money and I have not been successful in getting  a
refund and I am 2500 miles away from Arizona.
  I realize that PLFVW made quality products, and perhaps furnished products
that List Members had difficulty finding anywhere else, but I think it is
time that we stop making excuses for what PLFVW/Dawn is doing now and label
it as the 'bad apple' it has become so that other List Members do not make
the same mistake and becomes victims as some of us have become.

&gt;always supporting one another and maintaining the hobby. Jerks who are not
&gt;honorable when doing business should be reported to the list. They are no
&gt;different than the bastards stealing parts off your bus in the middle of
&gt;the
&gt;night. Theives are theives and I think it's best that we identify them for
&gt;one another.
