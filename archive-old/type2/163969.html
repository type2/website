Subject: Re: [T2] Rebuild or replace? 1.8L FI engine from 75 Auto westy

Hi Don,

I met Boston Bob back in 2003... He definitely builds an engine worth 
considering. My Dad reminded me of Bob's rep about two minutes after I 
posted the message.

Happy trails,

&gt; I have yet to hear anything that would steer me away from BostonBob (
&gt; www.bostonengine_dot_com). But they're quite a bit more: $2000-$2500. In 
&gt; those
&gt; ranges I'd rather buy a Camper Special kit from Raby for $3k and 
&gt; assemble it
&gt; myself.
