&gt; All I have is a long block.  I don't want to cut the sheet metak if I don't 

ah!  however one of the reasons for the new cooling system was the stock
type I doesn't cool well enough.

&gt; have to.  Is it possible to use a late tranny?  Any suggestions as to what 

well if I recall the late tranny is an inch or so longer, also I think the
engine is longer so I suspect you will have to modify the tin
anyway.  there is an awefull lot of room behind the pully on a type I, the
type IV barely has an inch or so, which is why many take the engine/tranny
out together.

&gt; I might try?  Thanks.  Going over Paris Mountain is getting to be a drag ;0)

those 4-5hundred cc's really make a difference
