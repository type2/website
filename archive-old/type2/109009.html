&gt; LOL, yeah you're right.  (I'm telling you the fish was THIS BIG).
&gt; Maybe it just feels like 30 gallons when it is full.  Sorry  *toe*

I carry a folding luggage dolly (large wheeled-style) in the bus for just
such an emergency.  It's small enough to easily store, but it sure beats
carrying heavy stuff.  Especially a 40+ pound full gas can.

I also discovered (at home) that a handy bar stool is a great place to rest
your elbows (or butt) when you're trying to pour that full 5-gallon can into
your bus.  Somebody needs to sell a bigger spout for those cans!
