&gt; &gt; Curious if there is anyone who has seen or knows of a place to find a spare

&gt; I did the same thing Bob,took the spare off the front,, added the emblem and had
&gt; good intentions to add the spare, and never did find a donut tire that would
&gt; fit, so I took a good donut that I got from another car, and redrilled the Vw
&gt; pattern inbetween the chev pattern, worked for me,,

As I recall, there were some severe safety concerns about the &quot;collapsable
spare&quot; tires, such as some of the exploded upon inflation killing their
owners!  If this is the type of tire you are referring to, I doubt that
the intervening years has made the rubber any stronger.

OTOH, if you're talking about the high-pressure temporary spares, they
work fine, but only on smooth hard roads.  If you get off the beaten path,
a full-size spare is a must.  I often carry two.
