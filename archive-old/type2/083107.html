Subject: Re: [T2] Coil feels hot to the touch!

It will get hotter than if the car is running!

When the car is running, current flows through the coil about half the
time (when the points are closed).  When the car is stopped with the key
on, there is a 50-50 chance that the points will be closed and that
current will flow at the engine's particular postion.

&gt; Dear Listees:
&gt;
&gt; Last night while me and son were trouble-shooting the electrical in our 70
&gt; bus, he noticed that the coil was very hot.
&gt;
&gt; We had not been running the engin at all.
&gt;
&gt; We were just following wires and such around to find problems.
&gt;
&gt; I touched the coil and it was very hot.
&gt;
&gt; We disconnected it.
&gt;
&gt; Do these coils get hot when the ignition is on with the motor not running?
&gt;
&gt; Do they get hot when the engine is running?
&gt;
&gt; I think we have a wiring problem to the coil, right?
&gt;
&gt; Many thanks.
&gt;
&gt; Bill and Erik Spencer
