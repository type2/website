Subject: [T2] Mercedes-Benz Buses/Vans [Including Westfalia conversion]

These vehicles were mentioned during the recent thread about the &quot;New
Microbus&quot; on the VintageBus and Type 2 Lists.

I finally found an English language version of the appropriate section of
the Mercedes-Benz website.  Follow the links to the &quot;Vito&quot; and &quot;Sprinter&quot;
pages, including photo galleries of the various versions.  Very interesting
vehicles  -  I'm surprised they haven't been offered on the N. American
market.

Another source I happened upon indicated these vehicles are manufactured in
Spain.  Their design supposedly predates the &quot;merger&quot; of Daimler-Benz and
Chrysler, but the &quot;Vito&quot; bears a remarkable similarity to the MoPar
&quot;minivans&quot;.

FWIW.....
