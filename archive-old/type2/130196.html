Subject: Gas Adjust

So has anyone else experienced this ? I got my new Gas Adjust shocks 
this week and I went out today and pulled the old fronts off, now the 
front one have a metal insert in the top bushing and NO insert in the 
bottom bushing as there is a metal sleeve on the bolt attached to the 
bus. Upon pulling out the new KYBs I find a metal insert in BOTH 
bushings ... so the top bolt will fit nicely but the bottom wont go on 
without removing this metal insert.

Has anyone else delt with this ? Am I going to have to get this pressed 
out ? I am really hoping someone has a smart answer. Also, before I 
pull the rears off, do THEY need to have one of the inserts pressed out 
of the new ones ?

Any help is appreciated.

Steve
