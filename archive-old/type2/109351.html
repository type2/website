Subject: Re: [T2] BB in vacuum line?

I was wondering if it had something to do with emissions. The carbon
cannister does have a hose that runs into that same round cannister on the
air cleaner that the vac advance line connects.

&gt;
&gt; I've heard this refered to as the &quot;BB Fix&quot; way back when.  I think it was
&gt; used to disable annoying emmissions systems, but I can't imagine why
anyone
&gt; would want to disable their vacuum advance...? Unless the canister failed
&gt; and caused a vacuum leak, but that's still no bueno in the long run...
