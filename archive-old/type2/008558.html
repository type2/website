ok everyone take a deep breath and release slowly.  now lets try again 
with how retrofitting parts and enjoying our vehicles to the fullest is 
bad karma.  first off, what????  we dont want to lose sight of the whole 
aura of the type 2.  my bus is ugly 3 shades of brown, big dent in the 
nose bondo is a close friend and someones living room gave up a bit up 
carpet for the inside.  but i love it.  nothing can beat the feeling i 
get when driving it around.  it does seem a bit sensless to drive around 
freezing if with only a change here and there you can have the comforts 
of heat.  yes heat ahhhh.  what am i saying?!  and change the bus!!  
yep. and why, well because it is mine.  and because i would love driving 
it if it were sitting on the ground and had dark tinted windows some big 
fat tires and a bigger engine in it as much as i would love driving it 
looking like it just came from the factory, big white walls and all. i 
love my bus, i love all busses.  nothing puts a bigger smile on my face 
than seeing a nice split driving down the road.  and i can enjoy that, 
however it looks.  just because it is out there and someone is taking 
the effort to keep it running and out on the streets for the world to 
see.  true i would rather have the fresh factory look by far.  but i 
cant be so narrow minded as to think that because a bus isnt done how i 
would do mine then it is bad karma. what does that say about my karma?  
with the way volkswagen is now trying to make sure there is no more good 
karma left we would all stick together to keep it going.  ok sorry my 2 
cents. and if noone agrees, thats ok with me.  just enjoy your busses.
