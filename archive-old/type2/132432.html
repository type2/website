Subject: RE: [T2] What would you do?

Yes, the RPM range is narrow (as in low) when used with a prop. A camshaft
change and possibly intake and exhaust can take care of that. Of course, the
higher the revs, the shorter the life.

The alternative automobile engines are good because they are cheaper, yes,
but they are usually modified (camshaft, intake and exhaust). They are also
not certified, and can only be used in aircraft designated as
&quot;experimental,&quot; typically owner built/finished.
