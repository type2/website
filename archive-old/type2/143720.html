Subject: black smoke during backfires

List,

  Hi everyone, I am still working on my 1974 vw bus
1800cc engine with 005 distributor.  I reset the
points gap to a dwell of 50 degrees and retimed the
engine to 10 degrees after TDC.  I am noticing that if
i rev the engine and release the throttle there is
slight backfiring accompanied with blacksmoke.  What
is going on to make the backfiring/popcorn sound.  I
still have a continual pop pop pop out of the exhaust
also.
