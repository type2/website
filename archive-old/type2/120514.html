Frustrating, isn't it? BTW, it occurred to me just a few minutes ago.. 
would backing out the idle air screw &quot;a lot&quot; reduce a vacuum reading? 
That's effectively what the idle air screw is, right? A controlled 
vacuum leak?

&gt; I don't get it either, but the engine seems to run better everytime
&gt; I start it. It's not running hot, it's idling well, it starts
&gt; fine in 20 degree weather.

Same here (except that we don't have 20 degree weather here in San 
Francisco :-)... the engine is clearly breaking in well, and it 
generally runs like a top (well, right up until my tank outlet got 
clogged :-/)
