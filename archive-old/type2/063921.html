&gt; If the Chassis number starts with 236, it's a '66 Kombi.  Check the

Well, I finally got off my ass and got my head out of the 1641cc I was 
building for the '66 and confirmed the model number of the Bus.  It is a 
standard 231 which tells me it is a LHD Kombi with Cargo Doors on Right.  
I could not find any indication of SO markings and because I did not have 
a pencil with me at the time failed to write down the 4 M codes.  I will 
do this tonight however.  I really doubt this was a camper of any kind 
and the PO just handmade and/or threw in some camper furnishings.

Date of manufacturer was &quot;18 1&quot; - Jan. 18 1966??

Ciao! And I will post M-Codes tonight or tomorrow morning from the '66
