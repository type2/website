Subject: Got parts...need more parts....

First the good news...my package arrived from Busboys this morning :)
Kudos to Jim and Bill, I now have functioning windshield wipers...and
given that it is raining today, I would try them out...save for my
Kingpin problem.  In my continuing search for kingpins that don't
require a pound of flesh as payment, I have only been able to dig-up
two vendors and a private offer... [when I called the local VW parts
department, the young fellow asked what a kingpin was ;-| Once I
explained it and he found it on the micro-fiche, he informed I that
stock was discontinued in 1986 :-(...ah well, they would have been
super expensive anyway].  Bus Boys and Wolfgang International
both sell rebuilt kingpin spindles...here's the numbers:

Wolfgang International
        Kingping spindles............................$199.95 (usd)/set
                this includes wheelbearings and races.
                there is a refundable core charge ...$100.00 (usd)
        Linkpins (not included with spindles)........$50.00 (usd)/set

        Total:.......................................$349.95 (usd)
                without core charge..................$249.75 (usd)

Bus Boys
        Kingpin spindles.............................$249.00 (usd)/set
                this does not include bearings or races.
                there is a refundable core charge ...$150.00 (usd)
        Linkpins (not included with spindles) .......$79.95 (usd)/set
        Bearings and races (9.95 each) x 4...........$39.80 (usd)

        Total:.......................................$518.75 (usd)
                without core charge..................$362.75 (usd)

Both are expensive [then again nothing on Ras Bulli Split has been
cheap...save maybe a couple of cable grommets and headlight seals].
However, the difference of $112.80 will more than pay for the new
starter and tune-up that Gunter is performing today.  I am actually
amazed by this as I have found Bus Boys to usually have good
competitive prices on most things...what am I missing here?  Jim, any
explanation?

As for the vendors, I have been happy with Bill &amp; Jim's service
- --including the rush order they did this week.  The only thing I know
of Wolfgang is that the fellow use to be involved with Bus Boys [so I
was told].  I tried WCM and RMMW and they best that they had were
drop-spindles [sacre! Je ne les mettrais jamais!].  

Is there anywhere else I should be looking?

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Splits...Oh, my!

Roy
