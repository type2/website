Subject: Deal on Riviera

Okay, I can't take it anymore! At least I waited until Friday.

I know it's against the rules to post items for sale on a specific auction
site that sounds almost e*Canadian*ay ;), but I p-mailed Ken three days ago
that this Riviera for sale out there on *B*y would be gone by noon if anyone
was paying attention...and IT AIN'T GONE YET! Aren't you people who want
Rivieras searching the auctions!?!?

It's in Oregon and I've got a nice-running Riviera, so I'm not looking, but
I know some of you are...and here's one that I'm certain the guy is selling
too cheap. If you're interested, the auction title is simply &quot;1977
Volkswagen : Van&quot;. Do your own research because I have not. There is a Buy
It Now feature for $700 on this running bus. If you chooose to bid instead
of buying it now, you'll blow the deal for yourself and everyone else
because there are sure to be about 200 adrenalin-filled volks-junkies
wanting to wait until the last minute and pick this up for $300, which is
the starting bid. Won't happen. The first bidder at $300 will guarantee that
this thing will go for at least $1200-$1500.

Okay, sorry for the across-the-line post. I just couldn't stand it anymore
since I know there are listies salivating in want of Riviera camperage.
Again, DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH. I have no connection or contact with this
seller and only know what he's said online.

P.S. If you don't know which auction site I'm talking about, you'll have to
go back and look at the charter for the forbidden auction site. I won't be
available through again until Monday.

Thanks! Joe
