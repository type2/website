I know this is not the way to do it, but................

I just need two chicken**** little parts, and I'm wondering if somebody 
could glom on to them for me.

1. Cigarette lighter assembly complete
2. You know that switch that is used to turn the interior back table 
light on and off in a
      Westy?  I need one of those assemblies, complete.

Both of these items are needed to properly install some auxiliary ham 
radio junk in NewBus.

I know, I know !
Pretty Please ??
