Thanks for the input here guys,
it all helps this Aircooled novice !

I've had the van for around a month now,
the gearbox looks as if it's a recent recon-unit...

Yes, you are probably right about the linkages...
but I'm not sure as to look for that's worn in comparison.....

Has anyone got a jpeg or link to one that may
point me in the right direction ?
Does anyone rate the trigger style gearstick shifter ?
(Trigger for reverse selection ?)

This may help me stop trying to
slip the old girl into reverse at 20 mph....

Now I'm going to wash my hands,
the keyboard is now covered in oil !

Thanks again for all the help here it's appreciated greatly.
