Subject: 93 Vanagon advice

OK list here goes.
My 18 year old son in Northern Vermont has his eye on a 93 Vanagon
automatic.  Here's what I know.
150,000 miles
Needs exhaust and probably other unknown mechanicals
Runs ok
Rust in rockers.

The guy is asking $7,000 from the kid.  This seems extraodinarily high.
What do you folks think it is worth based on the meger information provided.

He already owns a 68 Type II here in NJ.

Appreciate the advice.
