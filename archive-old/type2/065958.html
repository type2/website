Subject: MAJOR oil leak

hey now,

well, i got the alternator in suprisingly easy today. thanks to sean and
stefan for help/pointers.

drove to work today. van ran great. but when i got to work i noticed a massive
oil leak. within 2 minutes it looked like most of my oil was on the ground.
seemed like it was coming from the front of the transmission. towards the
front of the bus.

hmm, what is going on here? what is the fix?
