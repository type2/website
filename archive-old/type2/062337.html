Subject: Brake Warning Light Wires

Hello All, I guess the list is settling down and getting more stable.

Is there anybody who can help me put the wires on the Brake MC Senders?

I have three tangs on each of the senders, and 2 wires with spade tongues,
and both wires are black.  I dont know yet which wires are hot.

luv,

James '69 Westy
