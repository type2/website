I hope the rotten ass holes die before they can get in the welfare line.

Now, having allowed their Neanderthal activities to cause me to talk so,
back to the problem at hand.

I recall seeing an article in one of the VW magazines a few years back
that dealt with refurbishing dashes and steering wheels. The technicals of
the article seemed pretty sharply thought out. I usually keep tough to
find stuff like this, so I'll have a look around. Anybody else recall that
article??
