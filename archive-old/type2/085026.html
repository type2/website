Subject: Re: [T2] Oils

I'm putting the engine in this weekend and I'd appreciate hearing directly
from anyone with a recommendation of which weight oil to use here in Texas
(don't want to start a huge thread on the topic). Also what weight gear oil
is recommended for a manual transmission? -- Richard 78 Westfalia Owner 

New engine HD30.  For break in at least.
From there you can switch to 20-50 or stay straight 30 or 40 (if it is
really hot in the summer).

I tend to stay HD30 all year now in Georgia.  My reason being that the heat
in the heads is enough to break multi viscosity oil down to a straight
weight quickly anyway.  So might as well leave out the extra stabilizers and
just go straight weight.  Make sure the oil has an API &quot;SL&quot; rating (over the
cheaper oils having &quot;SJ&quot;) since it is the latest and greatest.  Granted in
the owners manual the factory grade at the time of manufacture was like
&quot;SG&quot;, so oil does evolve over time. 

As for the tranny GL-4 for ALL VW bus manuals.  Do not get GL-5!  Only in
the automatic was GL-5 used.

Lots of past threads on this, hit the archives for a weeks worth of reading.
