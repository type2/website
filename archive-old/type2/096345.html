I've been stuck on the side of the road much more often with carbs than
FI, and never had to hike out with a bus FI.

once you get it right, it just keeps going and going and going.  it is a
PITA to learn to think differently and to actually have to learn to read
instruments and follow the manual but it is no harder than a single carb
and far far far easier than dual carbs.
