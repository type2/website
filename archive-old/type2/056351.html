Subject: Legal Towing

List-
I've been looking at some possible Bus projects that would involve buying a
Bus with a blown engine and towing it home to fix up and eventually
register. I live in New York State and have looked at Busses in other
states and now discover it is illegal to tow an unregistered uninsured
vehicle in CT and NYS so the U-Haul type rigs are out. A trailer would work
or a flatbed truck. I don't think they rent flatbeds without a driver
($$$$$) but a trailer would be fine. Does anyone know who rents these? Does
insurance cover this? Would it be the tow car's insurance or the trailer
insurance? How do you get a Bus home legaly? I've made many calls and have
even gotten contradictory information from the State Police. If I find a
Bus that I want I don't want any trouble on the way home.
Thank you all for your help now and in the past.
