+AD4-After blowing oil all over my heater boxes due to a damaged piston, it is
now
+AD4-very hard to ride with the windows up. The smell of hot oil engulphs the
+AD4-interior.


Pity it's this time of year. I renovated my boxes in the spring and then got
oil on them from the push rod tubes. I steam cleaned the outsides, but still
didn't cure the oil smell. After a summer of driving with the heater off
(hot air venting out of the control boxes) the smell has gone.
