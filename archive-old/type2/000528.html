Hello,

I currently have 2 seperate keys for my 1971 Westy.  One for the ignition,
the other for the door locks.  I would like to get a lock for the engine
hatch.  Instead of having 3 seperate keys, is there an inexpensive and easy
way to have all the locks (including the engine hatch lock) re-keyed to work
with a single key?

Thanks.
Leo
