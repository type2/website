Subject: RE: V joint 1/2shaft compatible with 76

Volks,

I *know* that '73-'79 are identical. I *think* that '68-'72 are also
identical wiht the '73-79 and I *know* that vanagon shafts are *not*
identical.  The CV's are the same, but the half shafts are different
(longer on the V'gon, I think, but that could be my dyslexia speaking :-)

One other interesting difference between the bay and the V'gon is that the
fit of the CV's on the half shaft on Bays runs from sloppy loose to pretty
tight, but I have never needed the puller.  On the V'gons, for some
reason, they *all* have been press-fit, and have *all* needed the puller
with some being metric bears to remove (metric bears are 2.2x as nasty as
english ones :-)
