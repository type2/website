I REALLY made that mistake back in the early to mid -90's when I first 
got into VWs. Watched a full set of JC Whitney body rubber rot in 1 yr's 
time. That and a few other items in my life sourced on price rather than 
quality and I finally changed my ways. Buy a quality item (balanced good 
price vs good quality) the first time and be happy for a long, long time 
rather than making repairs again and again. The original lasted 20-30 
yrs and I want my replacement to last just as long and if I have to slow 
down my project so my dimes and nickels catch up with my progress to buy 
quality so be it.

I have sworn off several of the local FLAPS for my late model daily 
driver needs for the same reasons. Worked at one (big chain store) and 
the budget repair parts seemed to last only a year or so.

Please support our list suppliers...
