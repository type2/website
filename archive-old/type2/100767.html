Subject: RE: [T2] Need a piston for 2.0 

Michael,

Unless you don't care about this motor I would recommend a new piston and
cylinder set. Chances are that the cylinder walls are scored or scuffed. I
would inspect the rest of the cylinders for ware and make the call. Just
replacing the piston might fix the low compression but it wont make it
correct.

&gt; After pulling and tearing down a 2.0 FI engine out of an 81 vangon, I've
&gt; discovered that the piston ring grooves on the number 4 piston
&gt; are cracked and
&gt; broken (this would explain the low compression).  The cylinder is good (no
&gt; grooves, gouges, etc.)  Does anyone know where I could get a
&gt; piston?  I don't
&gt; want to buy a complete piston set if I don't have to.
