Subject: RE: [T2] Re: Canvas Install

I did mine like the first picture below. The same way that I took it off. It
is a little more work, but you cannot see the plastic strip at all. It is
completely hidden on the inside. You definitely want to at least have the
fold at the top. If not as Robert stated below, you will have to much at the
bottom. Although the canvas I bought was from Gowesty_dot_com, I am sure that
the Bus Depot canvas is long enough to reinstall like the original. Although
when you are fitting it together, it will be very tight. After a few days it
will stretch out.

Dear Jeff,

I could have installed mine more elegantly. I did not make a careful study
of the way the original was installed before I removed it (duh...). I
think the original is probably like this: C = canvas, P = plastic strip, #
= poptop

If you installed like the last illustrated example, you'd probably have a
little too much canvas to deal with at the bottom. As I understand it, the
only reason to fold at the top at all is to adjust the length so the thing
fits well. It's easier to take in extra fabric at the top than at the
bottom, seems to me. Your actual mileage may vary.
