Hey all.
I have had a mechanic (I've been using for a while now) replace my push-rod
tube seals for me about 6 months ago. After only about 2 months they started
leaking again, so he replaced them again for free. Right after that a new
leak in the front main seal reared its head and that was replaced. Now I
noticed the new push-rod tube seals over the heat exchangers are leaking
again.

The question:
Am I driving my engine too hard ('72  pancacke engine, single weber 160k) or
is my mechanic a dork or what?

He has done a good job on everything else.
I have been known to hit 70 or so on the freeway a few times, but not much.
I am going to just have to change them myself this next time unless the
mechanic will fix them for free again.
Thanks loads
