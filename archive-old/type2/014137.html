&gt; Why would you think that a couple of valves are  stuck?

good question.

i expect because i torqued the heads the other day and the valves
are still seating.  I drove it a bit on Saturday, did the valves
yesterday morning, test drove it a bit yesterday trying to track down
some bugs, then was in the process of timing it when it would
no longer start.

in retrospect, this is probably because the valves were really off,
however, I was under the impression that I was having some weird
dizzy problems (long story), figured I'd just swap the 009 in for the
vacuum advance dizzy and see how she went.  it continued to not start
(due to the fact that my timing was way off and my valves were really tight,
still seating, I presume), until I managed to get it running 180 degrees
out (???!), at which point i stopped and went to bed.  This morning,
checking the valves, I found the 2 stuck valves.

so, i expect, either:  

a) the valves were tight and i ran it and they somehow got stuck

b) the valves got stuck while seating (??)


OH, so i just realized you meant:  Why do i think they're stuck, in the
&quot;how do you know they're stuck&quot; sense...

A: because i am adjusting the valves and those two valves will not move
farther open then a very tight .006, despite removing the adjusting 
screw.

&gt; Did you take a compression test on those cylinder's?

well, i've got zero compression on those cylinders right now because the
valves are stuck open, right?

&gt; Putting the distribtor in 180 off wouldn't cause the valves to get hung
&gt; up.

&gt; If you think they are, rap them with a ball pein hammer, with a deep
&gt; socket on the valve collar.

got it.
 
&gt; Timing being off would never cause this.
&gt; 
&gt; It could burn a valve, but not cause them to stick.

ah.  cool.  then mayhaps they just seated that way (cringe)?

very interesting.

Thanks!!!
