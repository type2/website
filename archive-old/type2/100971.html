Subject: Re: [T2] Door mirror restoration

&gt; I have a 20+ year old door mirror which needs restoration.  The silver

&gt; can be mounted in the original mirror frame?  Or does one completely
&gt; replace the entire fixture to restore the mirror?  Thank you in advance.

yes it can be done, I did it, replacement mirrors are far cheaper and much
much easier.   but if you really want to know.

I made a card board pattern just barely big enough to slip into the space
took the cardboard and after breaking about four pieces of mirror glass
trying to cut it, I finally made it from mirrored plastic.  
slipped it into the space and reused the plastic bead to hold it in, a
small piece of foam behind the mirror to hold it tight against the bead.

it works and has held up for several years, but I have since gotten a
replacement and at some point I will  replace the whole assembly.

good luck
Bob
