&gt;1. Something is not per the stock schematic. If double relay pin &gt;86a is at or near 12 volts the pump should run. The pump wire from &gt;double relay pin 88d is red and blue.

It is not getting a full 12vdc, more like 8.

&gt;2.Both solenoid pins 30 and 50 have red and white wires attached.

I have a red/white at t50, and several solid red at t30

&gt;3.The hot start relay applies power to pin 50 directly from pin 30.

I don't know it I have a hot start relay, it wasn't stock was it?

&gt;activated by the red and white wire from the ignition switch
&gt;(position 3)that formerly was hooked to pin 50 (in stock &gt;configuration).

Right, but I get the voltage in postion #2 as well.

&gt;4. If you run the pump with an external 12 v source will the bus &gt;start?

No, I've tried. This is another disturbing fact, as it opens another whole can of worms.

Ugh!
