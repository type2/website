Subject: Re: [T2] GoWesty service/rubber glues

&gt; &gt; Now....What kind of glue to put them on?
&gt; &gt; I have repainted my seat pedestals with the rattle can. Will anything stick the rubber to them now?
&gt;
&gt; I am sure there is something made for that purpose but I would use
&gt; Pliobond, use with plenty of fresh air, flying is for aircraft...

Goop would do it well without a doubt. and you can get it everywhere.
I would test whatever glue you use on the painted pedastals first to make
sure the solvents will bond to it.
