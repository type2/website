I once put a 1600 single port engine in a 73 bus,  for a guy *way down below
the border in Mexico* who had blown his original pancake engine. We did it
because it was the only engine we had available.  You will have to fabricate
something for the rear hanger, and you'll need some tin to fit all the way
around the engine to seal it.

I agree with David.  Sounds like your mechanic doesn't know type
4s..........

Buyer beware!

&gt; &gt;My father-in-law has a 1974 VW Safari Camper Van and it has a blown

&gt; &gt;I am not even sure what motor it has in it.  Could someone tell me?
&gt;
&gt; It will either be a stock 1800 engine or a 1900 engine (1800 with 96mm
&gt; cylinders - this is what was on my Safare when I bought it).  Type IV
style
&gt; pancake engine with dual Solex carbs.  If it's an automatic, it might be
&gt; fuel injected, but those are pretty rare in that year.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Anyways he was talking to a mechanic that supposedly knows VW's and he
told
&gt; &gt;him to put a 1600 Dual Port engine in it rather than rebuilding the old
one.
&gt;
&gt; Ask your mechanic where he plans to come up with the proper tin and engine
&gt; mount hardware to make that work.  If he doesn't have a really good
answer,
&gt; get a new mechanic.  You might want to get a new mechanic regardless of
his
&gt; answer since he obviously does not have a good understanding of the type
IV
&gt; pancake engine.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;So my question is what VW's have this motor in it and does anyone know
where
&gt; &gt;one can be found?
&gt;
&gt; Any motor from 72-74 will bolt up to the bus.  With 75 and up engines you
&gt; will have to deal with the fuel-injection vs. carb issue.  With 76 and up
&gt; engines you will also need a 76 and up bellhousing and starter to go with
&gt; the engine.  With 79 and up engines you will also have the problem of
&gt; rectangular exhaust ports vs. oval.  I wouldn't bother with an engine
newer
&gt; than the 80 model year, as it is just too much trouble unless you really
&gt; know what you are doing.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Also is a 1600 going to have enough power to pull a camper van?
&gt;
&gt; &quot;Enough power&quot; is subjective.  It will have less power than the stock
&gt; engine did for sure.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Any insight would be greatly appreciated as I know nothing about these
&gt; &gt;vehicles except that the motor is real easy to take out.
&gt;
&gt; In 72 and later busses I think you will find that the engine is not so
easy
&gt; to take out, at least not compared to the earlier models.
