&lt;&lt; Here is a friday question.  When you sleep in your camper, do you find it
 &gt;more comfortable with your head to the front or to the rear?
 &gt;(Forgive me, it's a slow day at work!)
 
 &gt;&gt;
It depends on  which decade  i was in .    The 70's was where ever , in, on, 
under.  The 80's were whichever was most  comfy.  T he 90's were mostly 
toward the front cause me wife tends to hit her head.       mark dearing
