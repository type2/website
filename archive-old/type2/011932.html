	&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; My problem is this.  Took the bus to the San
&gt; Raphael Swell in Central Utah
&gt; and she ran great the whole time.  No weird noises
&gt; and the gauges were all
&gt; straight up where they ought to be.  Coming down
&gt; out of a canyon late Sunday
&gt; night, the RPMs dropped to 0 in a split second
&gt; with no other indications of
&gt; power loss.


uneducated guesses:

can you get vapor lock on your fuel tank in a FI system?

it could be that you're getting no fuel, right?  I just
recently replaced the push-rod on the fuel-pump in my
'71 bus and it had been behaving in an almost similar way --
it would be fine driving around for 5-10 minutes, and
then it would start to chug (as if running out of gas)
for 30 seconds before it died completely and wouldn't
start.  Leaving the bus sit for a couple of hours
solved the problem in both cases, and it started right
up (and ran for another 30 minutes).

just a guess.  I wonder how you would check if it was getting
fuel in a FI...
