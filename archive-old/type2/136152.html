Ok I have the solution here. We are both correct. I was commenting on
the picture daniel posted which shows the distributor connected
correctly [0]. I'm pretty sure you are commenting on something daniel
said in the text of the post that seemed to indicate he had switched
from what the picture showed to the opposite, which like you are
pointing out is 120% wrong (inflation you know :)

In case daniel hasn't seen this yet the library article is:

&gt; I know that some kid on thesamba_dot_com forum thinks it's the same way
&gt; his is hooked up also.  However, lotsa people have their vacuum
&gt; hooked up wrong.  

haven't been following that, but it could be what our disagreement was
about. Commenting on two different setups daniel had at different
times.
 
&gt; Anyway, Daniel has a vacuum gauge as I've learned from posts
&gt; offlist.  Daniel, hook up your gauge to the port on the left side of
&gt; the carb.  It should show no vacuum at idle and then spike as you
&gt; open the throttle.  If it does, then it should be connected to your
&gt; advance.  The advance side of the vacuum pot is the more curved
&gt; part, in other words the outside aspect.  Also check the rear port
&gt; on the carb, rear meaning towards the rear bumper.  It should show
&gt; vacuum at idle (around 15&quot;) and should have no vacuum as you open
&gt; the throttle.  Hook this up to the other port in the inside of the
&gt; vacuum pot. That would be the reverse of how it appears to be hooked
&gt; up in the photo.  If the ports are somehow backwards, then leave it
&gt; the way it is.  That should clear up any confusion.

are we looking at the same picture ray? The pic listed above shows
this exactly as you describe, so it should be correct.
