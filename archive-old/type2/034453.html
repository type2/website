Well I  was able to purchase a mexican longblock and installed in in the 
motel parking lot in wilson north carolina. Have put 800 or more miles on it 
straightaway.
I'm now is south Florida wondering if the van will make it back north. Pulled 
the 
rocker arms off yesterday and tightened up the lower head bolts, as Muir 
would say,
it sounded as if Thor was hammering around in there. Still haven't nailed 
down the 
reason I blew my previous motor, but suspected a bad dual vacuum biscuit as 
the culprit and switched on my 009. Unfortunately I'm now getting power 
pickup problems on the highways and hope checked the timing and accelerator 
pump, so 
now think it might be a plugged heat riser all along. I wonder how long that 
takes before it burns a rod?  We'll see.....

-I will properly thank everyone who helped when and if I get the hell back 
home.
