&gt;I am also doing a new batch of the Air Cooled Search &amp; Rescue Team shirts.
&gt;Those went really fast, and are a great design, featuring a fireman's type
&gt;logo, with a VW logo in the center, and a picture of a splitty and early
&gt;Beetle, with the words &quot;Protect&quot; and &quot;Save&quot; on it. Lots of people have seen
&gt;this design, and can attest to it's desirability.

Not that all of Poor Richard's T-shirts aren't great, I like all of them,
but the Aircooled Search &amp; Rescue shirts move in an orbit of their own. I
am telling you that this is the coolest T-shirt ever conceived for bus
freaks.

He really *is* poor and he really doesn't keep any inventory, if you want
one you better get it now. I have tried desperately to get the rights to
this T-shirt so I can print a couple thousand, it's that good. =^) The last
time Richard did a batch was nearly two years ago. It is a collector's item
and it is not going to turn up in the RMMW catalog so get it while you have
a chance or you will kick yourself when you see one at a show.

Speaking umlautly and umphatically,
