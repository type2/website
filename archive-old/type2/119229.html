Subject: Re: [T2] Where to find an Alternator Upgrade?

&gt; Ok all...I have decided to go and replace my burned
&gt; out generator with an alternator, and I appreciate all
&gt; the helpful advice from the last time I posted.  Now
&gt; my question, I noticed that Bus Depot has an Altrnator
&gt; upgrade kit.  Does anyone have any experience with
&gt; said kit?  Or does anyone have a better place to find
&gt; such a thing?

I've been thinking about the same thing.  What I came across at BD was
running around $200.  I came across another kit that sounds like it does the
same thing in The Real Source, but they are only asking $149.  Does anyone
know about this kit?

Have a great Thanksgiving!
Eric
