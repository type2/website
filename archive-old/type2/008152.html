&gt; Hello. I've did a few Subaru conversions, it is quite simple. In
fact the
&gt; hardest thing is to choose where you'll put the radiator; before you
had two
&gt; choice cut the front or the back. But lately I've come up with another
&gt; solution, KEP in their catalog state that the Subaru1800cc opposed
four only
&gt; need a 300 inches square rad, so I'll try to put two small Renault 5
&gt; radiator( one in each air intake on the side at the back of the bus. 
I've seen a Subaru 1800 conversion with a radiator in the left side of
the engine bay, drawing air from the left air scoop only.  The
radiator pretty much filled the opening and was leaned inward slightly
at the top to clear the spare tire bulge.  I don't know what car the
radiator came from other than the fact that it was Japanese.  The
radiator was well-shrouded and was equipped with a standard-looking
electric fan with a thermostatic switch

(If
&gt; you're interested just send me mail and I'll tell you how it went). 

We are!

&gt; If you're  considering to put a Subaru engine in a VW, don't forget
to have
&gt; a bearing installed in the center of the Subaru Crank so it don't
shake
&gt; excessively.

Do you mean in the center of the crankshaft (main bearing?!) or
something like a pilot bearing?
