Subject: Re: October 71 Bus - front emblem clips

	I tried getting clips from the VW Dealer and they suppled
four plastic gizmos that definately DON'T fit the posts on our
'70s emblem... but they DO fit the holes in the body. So I
drilled holes THROUGH the clips and that seems good. But wall
anchors should work about as well. 3/8&quot; seems a bit BIG but
I'll try to measure tonight
