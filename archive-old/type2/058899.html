Subject: My trip to Vanfest - Long

I've just read Bob Wallace's post on Vanfest (I'm on Digest and have had a week
off so I'm still catching up...) and it reminded me that I was going to post a
&quot;trip report&quot; on the day out too. Now I know this isn't going to compete with
these USA marothon journey's but here goes...

Sunday 20th Sept. Loaded van up with myself, my parents (they love the van so
much they paid for some of the restoration as long as they get to borrow it from
time to time) and Ben the dog who think's it's a big blue kennel. The run to
Malvern (UK) should only take just over the hour, although it varies depending
on the route as the only streatch of motorway is a mile long between junctions.
The van ran VERY sweetly (sorry no engine out in the middle of nowhere story)
and we arrived late morning. Actually the route was chosen to try and see the 5
WW2 and later jet fighters parked up in a farm along the way. There is no
runnway and they don't look to have moved for a few years so they must have
arrived in bits. Trouble is you can only see them from the road in a vehicle
high enough to look over the hedge such as a T2 :-)  The whole journey was
through country lane and small town. The sun shone and everything was right with
the world.

On arrival we were parked differently to previous years. Same field, different
orientation. The people on the gate we friendly (as always) and there were
plenty of vans to waive at. Parked up and poped the top for a drink and then off
to the show !

Now there may have been more people but what I noticed was that there was more
show. It was much bigger that last year and the increase wasn't made up by
stalls of rusty parts either. I think it took a couple of hours to get to the
show &amp; shine and displays. By that time we had seem a new beetle, a new classic
shape beetle and a new van. I've ssemn all these before but my dad wants a new
T2 now, it costs the same as the new beetle but has a whole lot more style. We
climbed all over the one on display (not litterally) and like everyone else now
want a nice lottery win to bring it home.

In the display area I talked to Bob and bought a fibreglass spare wheen support
for the front of the van from him - he says it is as rare as hens teeth and
since it's the only one I've seen I won't disagree. I plan to spray it body
colour before using it and hopefully avoiding the rust on the front effect as
well as taking the strain off the front pannel. Talking of which, can you
beleive someone stole a bus front from the Alan Schofield stand ? :-&lt; Having
talked &quot;new bus&quot; I still don't think 70mph on the falt and not slowing down on
hills is natural though....
The displays seemed to include a &quot;who can do the ugliest alteration to the bus&quot;
competition with several watercooled engines in busses and radiators on the roof
etc. The Devon display was great with some superb vehicles as was the show &amp;
shine. There were more splitties than in previous years but at last some really
good bays were there, all set up inside with proper table settings like a real
vintage vehicle should be. Lovely.

Van's for sale (20 ish vehicles) had some goodies, at least I have seen aproper
Doormobile inside including the cooker now.

Well the sun stayed shinning, I finally replaces that rusty wing mirror (don't
buy Euro car parts, in my experience thay are c**p) resisted buying an automatic
side step (Just Kampers 145ukp) now wish I'd had a long look at a shortened
pickup for 150ukp (worth it for the tyres/engine ?), got the address for the
supplier of my excellent spoiler which I will post when I rememeber to bring it
in to work and took a load of photo's.

At the end of the day we watched the new T2 pull off towing a new classic beetle
EASILY and trundled home. Van ran sweetly again and I sat in the back thinking
how he could be brought up to standard while watching the world go by - the new
table leg (to replace that 'orible wobbly one) will help. Strangly enough we did
the return journey faster than the outward one, I think the signposts need
improving !
