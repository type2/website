&gt;  Hello I just picked up a 1600 bug engine that has an alternator.  The 
&gt; wires
&gt;  to the alternator are connected by a three prong plug.  Because it was 
outta
&gt;  a bug I didn't get a good look to where those wires go.  The thick red one
&gt;  either goes to battery or to solenoid. But after that?  IM sure I could 
play
&gt;  trial and error but,  I figured I would post and see what you guys say.  Is
&gt;  going in to a 72 westy that had a  1600 w/ a generator, I still have 72
&gt;  wiring though.
&gt;  Thank in advanced

Hi Chad,

Appologies for only being able to give you half answer ... but the wiring is 
definetly NOT as you suggest.

There are two types of aternator for 1600 buses - one has a spade terminal 
and a threaded terminal and uses an internal regulator the other has the 
three pronged plug which you describe and uses an EXTERNAL regulator which 
you MUST HAVE&gt;

&gt;From memory (falable) all three wires are connected to the regulator and 
a wires from there go to the generator light and the starter motor; and I 
cann't remember which wire goes where.

Sorry this is only half an answer, prehaps someone with this alternator / 
regulator combination will enlighten you further.

Good luck
