&gt; For some reason, downshifting in my '80 Vanagon does not net me the
&gt; benefits I would expect.  My &quot;driving style&quot; in mountains goes as follows.

&gt; happening, no sweat.  However, I would think that I *should* be able to
&gt; hold 45-50 in 3rd w/o a problem, but I can't. It isn't a lack of HP, but
&gt; rather that if I try, the oil temps climb rather rapidly.  My thinking is

there is a certain physical limit of how much air can be pushed through a
plunum,  once you reach that point the fan just will not force anymore air
through.

&gt; in air thru the fan as trying to do 50 in 3rd even on the flat will raise

my optimum speed is about 55mph more than that she gets hot, at that speed
she runs coolest

as for shifting,,,,well once I put it in &quot;D&quot; I pretty much let the engine
and tranny discuss it among themselves and decide which is right.  It
downshifts long before it lugs and upshifts way before it overrevs...which
is pretty much how the folks in the fatherland intented

&gt; Any thoughts on this?

yup my couple pfenning worth
