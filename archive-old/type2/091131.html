Subject: Re: [T2] if it ain't one thing...

there was no battery in the bus when i bought it, so i stole the battery
out of my bug (along with several other parts i ended up needing). so i
have no way of knowing what size battery was in it originally... but i
would think a 70 bus would be 12v, since they switched bugs over in 67
(sorry, i just know more about bugs than busses at this time, so that is
what i use as referrence. i know it isnt always the same, but often they
are close enough to use some common sense). 

so there :^P
chris, the powerless... man, i gotta stop the bad puns here...
