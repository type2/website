&gt;Folks,
&gt;  Well I am finally in the closing phase of the bus resto... (what do 
&gt;you mean it's been 3 years)  anyway I have taken all the interior 
&gt;panels out and recreated them in wood. Now the problem ...I am trying 
&gt;to figure out the best way to attach them to the doors and other walls 
&gt;of the bus...I recall there was some discussion about the method of 
&gt;fastening but couldn't find anything in the archives that helped me. I 
&gt;wonder if just redrilling all the holes and putting in self tapping 
&gt;screws would be the way to go but I would love to use the existing 
&gt;holes in the body. Has anyone had experience with this??? I am willing 
&gt;to try anything at this point :)
&gt;Thanks in Advance
&gt;
