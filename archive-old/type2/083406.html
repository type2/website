Subject: Heat exchanger update, pictures

Hello List, 

I just thought I would show you what I did to the heat
exchanger today. I didn't get much done but I think I
will get faster as I go along. I have decided to not
use fiberglass wrap. Thanks for the advice. Thanks so
much, gotta run. Have a good night!

David KElly
