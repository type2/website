Subject: Re: Anyone Build Their Own Air Dam?

&gt;A Porsche mechanic in St. Louis retrofitted his bus with a 
&gt;turbocharged 2.7 liter 911 engine.  Given his terminal velocity, 
&gt;he needed an air dam and adapted one from an old BMW 2002.
&gt;Claimed that there's an unstable region between 75 and 85 mph, 
&gt;but that the bus &quot;feels rocksolid&quot; above that speed.

I haven't noticed any instabilities up to speeds of 100 mph other than side 
winds doing their thing and an airdamn wouldn't affect that much.  What I have 
noticed is that it takes a LOT more power to run 85 mph than it does to run 65 
mph.  I've got the gearing for it, just not enough umph from my 4 banger.

Honestly, I don't believe an airdamn would improve the aerodynamics of a bus 
enough to make any noticeable difference.  Unless you built a really BIG one 
and covered the whole front of the bus with it (don't forget to leave a clear 
area to see through)  :)
