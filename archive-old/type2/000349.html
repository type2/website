Just bought the most important item for my new bus- a 5 lb. industrial fire
extinguisher. It's kind of bulky so I thought I would ask where everybody
else mounts their fire extinguishers. (I'm sure we all have one in our bus-
Right?)
Anyone have any creative ideas? TBear

Don't take life too seriously - you'll never live through it.
