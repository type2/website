Subject: Seattle Tacoma area. Bry's run
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

Volks,
  Bry's is in West Seattle off of West Mariginal way. 
We are meeting in a Boeing parking lot on East Marginal way
about a mile from the Museum of flight at aprox. 1pm .
  From I-5 take exit 158. Go West to the first big
intersection which will be East marginal. Go right or North
on East Marginal Way to one of the next 2 traffic lights.
Go left at either one of these into the parking lot. There
is a restaurant called &quot;Randy's&quot; across the street from
this parking lot... the lot itself is right on East
Marginal and you will be able to see the whole lot from the
street.
  Bry's is on 110 So. Kenyon St., This location is a bit
off the beaten track so that is why we are meeting at the
easier to find location.
  the Phone number there is 206-938-3868.
to summerize...
meet in Boeing parking lot _at_ 1 pm (13:00)
Saturday, Oct 21st.
Carabus (or whatever) to Bry's for parts picken
and general conversation... then off to Alki Beach
for food... Restaurants available or bring your own.

      Dan
