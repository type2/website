Subject: Re: Electric Windshield Washer on '78?

Volks:

All this talk of electric windshield washers reminds me that---

I &quot;believe&quot; if you tickle the search function (or mebbe it was in the
Library), I &quot;think&quot; that Bob Wallace penned something about creating an
electric w/w thingie for his older Bay Window...

It inspired me to do the same to my '72 Weekender, to which I added the
'73-up &quot;double stalk&quot; turn signal / wiper control assembly.  One also
&quot;should&quot; add the later '73 up wiper motor which has the momentary &quot;flick
wipe&quot; terminal on it (see more below about WHY it is a real good
idea...)

You guys/gals are on the right track about subbing in a fabricated
holder/momentary switch based on the size and shape of the old (and
likely defunct) pneumatic valve.  IIRC I used the p-valve to &quot;shape to
fit&quot; a piece of aluminum flat stock, to which I JB-Welded a momentary
switch (a Radio Shack purchase maybe?), such that the head of the
momentary was impinged upon by the contact of the OE stalk control.  The
momentary closed ground of a relay, which in turn, powered up a Porsche
924 washer pump scrounged from the local bone-yard.  The washer pump was
suspended underneath the OE '72 washer tank, and plumbed into the system
using the existing tubing.  The old &quot;in/out&quot; tubing to/from the now
deceased p-valve was spliced together using small diameter neeples from
the FLAPS...  I believe that Bob's article mentioned use of fish tank
one-way valves to keep the fluid column high in the tubing.  My FLPS
(friendly local pet store) clerks had no idea what the f*ck I was
talking about, apparently learning as much as they could at the FLAPS
and having moved on to greener pastures.  I didn't use any check valves.

It all worked GREAT (&quot;Hey, everbody, CHECK this out!  I bet ya yer bus
cain't do this!&quot;) until one fateful day, when out of the blue, the...

Lines from the tank to the pump split (you DO have to use a double layer
of tubing over all the connections) and dumped out the reservoir.  Oh
yes, you need to vent the reservoir too, but you can figure THAT one
out.  One of the other lines up under the dash came adrift and then it
pee'd all over me while in use (sound familiar?).  Lastly, the driver's
side washer jet plugged up with something (washer pump booger?), and the
little ball in the jet in the other side no longer stays put either :-(,
and so now it just dribbles all over.  I give up - back to paper towels!

My recommendations &amp; 2 cents:  WHILE you are in there replacing the
non-momentary wiper motor with a momentary-equipped motor (pre-'73 only
upgrade, everyone else just get busy with the lines), replace BOTH the
washer jets (Bus Depot? Other vendors?), and replace all the old tubing
too, unless you want to constantly be d*cking around with your system.
Rip it all apart once - do it right, and fugeddaboutit (maybe)...

HTH

&quot;Hey honey, where's the window cleaner?  The bus has icky
arthropod-splats all over it.  Again.&quot;
