Subject: Cable Conundrum

Hiya All,

The Duck has a 1600 sp which is in stock condition.  Well, nearly stock 
condition.  I am missing the cable which connects the air filter horn to the 
thermostat mechanism.  You know, it opens and closes the little flapper gizmo 
in the air filter.

So.........I thought I'd cruise a boneyard or two and see if I could scare 
one of these cables up.  And the thought occured to me that I'm going to find 
a lot more old Beetles than Buses.  Which brings us around to this 
question............Is this cable (I don't even know its name) 
interchangeable from Busses to Beetles and vice versa?  Does it change from 
year to year?

Any pointers out there for finding this thing?

TIA,

Mike
