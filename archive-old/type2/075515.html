Subject: new engine in 71 bus will not start

So I am having a couple of problems in getting my brand new engine to =
go. The first problem is no spark coming out of the coil. I have 12v =
coming into the coil from the switch up front but when I pull the center =
wire off the cap and hold it close to a ground while having the bus =
turned over I see no spark of any color. Can a coil be bad? It is such a =
simple thing that I find it hard to believe. I have a compufire =
installed but it isn't a complicated install so I don't think that it =
can be wrong, as long as the wires are on the correct terminals. Problem =
#2 was discovered before I knew there was no spark. When I am turning =
the engine over without the plugs in, so as to prime it, it turns like a =
champ. Once the plugs are back in, it is VERY slow in turning over. =
Everything on the engine is brand new so should I just assume that it is =
the strong compression of a brand new engine that is causing this? This =
is my first vw so any sage like advice would be most appreciated.=20
