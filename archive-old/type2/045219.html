Subject: FW: [T2] RE: Volkswagen; what are you trying to do?

&gt;Where are all the buses in Holland?

Well they are there but you don't get to see them on the road very often.
Our bus club has over 750 members of which the majority has a loaf or
Vanagon (but we cater for buses of all ages, from split (T1) to brand new
(T4). The older ones, like my own Clipper listed in the book 'The original
VW bus', will only come out when the sun shines.

And during the last couple of weeks they all went on vacation south to find
some sun :-)

Have a look at our photoalbum:

early loaf : http://www.vwbusclub.nl/fotoboek/fotoboek_t2a.htm

later loaf : http://www.vwbusclub.nl/fotoboek/fotoboek_t2b.htm
continued on : http://www.vwbusclub.nl/fotoboek/fotoboek_t2b2.htm

You'll find some very nice ones including a working cherry picker.
