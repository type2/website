Subject: Re: [T2] Dead Battery? Intermitent Fault?  Weekend away in
  tatter s?

&gt; Sooo, it _is_ possible to use the stock alternator to support two batteries?
&gt; How does one &quot;optimize&quot; an alternator?
&gt; 
&gt; I've been looking at upgrading to two batteries from the get-go here, and
&gt; wasn't quite sure where to start.

Here is a link to a few things to think about...
http://www.globalserve_dot_net/~jrivers/aux-batt.htm

The page isn't written too well.... but the point[s] that I was trying to make:
1  You shouldn't use large wire to connect an aux battery to the starter
battery/alternator
2 There is a couple of ways to wire the relay so it will work basically the same
3 The explanation of the Hella relay kit wiring for Aux battery installation

Hope that helps,,
