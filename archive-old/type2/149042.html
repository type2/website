Subject: 82 Westy Wheel Bearings

I am getting a rear brake job on my 82 Westy.  Last job was 3 years ago as the van had no use to speak of until I bought it in June. I have put on 4500 miles and the rear brakes are at less than 20% left but the fronts have 70% left.  Wondering if the front bearings can be repacked.  My newer vehicles have sealed bearings so you don't repack them.  I dont want to go in to the mechanic and ask him to do something that he cannot do and also see that I don't have a clue.
