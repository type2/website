&lt;&lt;The dual Solexes used in '72-74 have been discontinued for years.  However,

I expect to have a few N.O.S. German sets coming from Europe in about 4-8

weeks, at somewhere around $390 for the pair.  If you need carbs sooner, you

could investigate a Weber progressive conversion, arguably not as good as

the original design but the standard workaround since the Solexes were until

now unavailable.

Sorry Ron, but I have to disagree with you.  In my opinion, the progressive
carb is much too difficult to tune properly, and unless you find the correct
version of this carb, you won't be able to use your stock distributor.  Of
course the best bet would be to stay stock.  Get the originals rebuilt or
replaced.  You will also need new plastic bushings on your linkage. 

An easy to install alternative is the Weber dual 34 ICT setup.  The
instructions are not very clear, but I would be willing to talk you through
the installation if needed.

I bought my setup from Performance Parts Warehouse last year for less than
$350.

Much smoother than the progressive and much better gas mileage.  They run
great in cold weather (after the bus warms up a bit), and provide much more
power.  I also converted back to the stock type dual vacuum advance dizzy,
from the PO's installed 009, which helped a great deal as well.

I don't want to start another argument regarding the Weber progressive.  There
are a FEW bus owners out there running this setup and are happy with it.  What
I am saying is that will the correct version weber progressive, correct
jetting, as well as other modifications, you may get the progressive to work
to your satisfaction.  But why go through all that aggravation?
