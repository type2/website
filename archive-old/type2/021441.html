&gt; The hose is just a push on hose but it is high preassure fuel injection
&gt; hose. Replace only with fuel injection hose and you can either leave the
&gt; little collar in place or toss it. You may want to use a clamp on both
&gt; ends of the new hose.
&gt; An engine compartment fire pretty well messes up all your vacume, fuel
&gt; and wiring.

Eh...  Not advisable to toss the collar.  Sorry, Stan, but you know, VW put everything there for a reason...  

That collar serves as the clamp, hardly 'nuff room for another fastener.  

Just had this done on my '79 and was chatting with the mechanic doing the work and he mentioned how many of these he's
seen without collars and it's not a good thing.  He definitely put new clamps on the other side of the hose.
