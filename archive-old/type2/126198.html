Subject: Re: [T2] Physics of towing

I towed a Hyundai from VA to TN with my 2.0 powered '65 Beetle (4 wheel disc brakes, etc). Got 23-25 mpg at 55-60 mph. Obviously in my case I was getting good gas mileage and better than the two car would have gotten running separately. Of course on some of the hills, I was starting to think about how I could fire up the Hyundai to help push both cars over the hills....
