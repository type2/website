Subject: Re: [T2] What is this??? anyone know?


&gt; They were with some carburetor parts but I couldn't
&gt; find any way that they attached to the carbs. Any
&gt; thoughts???
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!

Dave, if you haven't gotten any replies, those sure look like the brackets that
mount to the engine block, between the Carbs, to hold the Air Filter assembly. 
They look like the ones that I had on my '73, with 1700 engine.  That was a
paper filter Air Filter.  Hope this helps.
