Subject: TRAILER HITCH FOR SALE

I have a trailer hitch for a late model bus (mid to late '70's).  It is made
of round tubular steel and attaches to vehicle with bumper mounts.  When
installed, it is hidden behind the bumper of the bus.  It will also fit a VW
Thing.

I have never used it.  I no longer have my bus and don't need it.

I would like to get $75.00 plus shipping for it.

I am in east Tennessee.


If you are interested, please e-mail me privately.

Thanks,
Victor
