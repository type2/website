Dear Folks,

Oh boy! It's nice to know that someone else likes the old R&amp;B! That's Gus's
favorite stuff although when he's in a mellow mood he'll cross over to jazz.
We did get in trouble with the law one time because of Gus's musical
preferences. We were pulled over for not having a Dead Head sticker! For
Real! The cop was a Grateful Dead fan and thought we were traitors. He let
us go, though. Nice guy. We need more police like him. :-)

Chris and Gus the &quot;Ja, I remember that...thought we were in real trouble&quot;
