Subject: Re: Whirring noise in back---fuel pump on when?

    Maybe more knowledgable listees can confirm this, but I was under the 
impression that the pump in FI motors shouldn't come on til the engine starts 
cranking.  This sticks in my mind because, when I first bought my current 
'77, we noticed that my fuel pump would run when the key was turned on.  I 
took it to my mechanic, who took the lid off the AFM and dicked with a 
contact, which took care of it---about a 30-second job.   I will find out 
exactly what was done if anyone needs to know.
