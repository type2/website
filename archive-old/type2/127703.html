Subject: re: bus not for sale

&quot;She actually BEGGED me to keep it! 

I was stunned, and told her so. She said she really
liked it and it
was worth losing me a day a week working on it. Well,
how could I say
no to that? So we're keeping it. :-)&quot;

So the bus is a keeper eh? I would say for sure your
wife
is!!:-)

My son and I have been putting a 83 Rabbit back
together
since last October.. with a 2L 16v transplant and
such.
Relax and just do one thing at a time.. it'll be done
and you can look back and hoepfully say.. &quot;that was good!&quot;

Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me;
Other times I can barely see.
Lately it occurs to me What a long, strange trip it's been.
