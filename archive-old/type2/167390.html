Subject: Re: [T2] Rust protection device - Snake oil or the fountain of
  youth ?

Hi George,

I think that is a very optimistic approach. If cars stopped rusting,  
there would be a LOT smaller market for new cars.

Perhaps the manufacturers are leaving this component out of their  
designs in order to boost sales. I think right now most manufacturers  
would do just about anything to help move some inventory. Canadian  
Tire added a similar unit to their product lineup earlier this year;  
you can see it at this link:

(when the site asks for a postal code, use L4W4Y6, it belongs to my  
previous employer)

Canadian Tire is a well-respected national chain, I don't think their  
buyers would put the company at risk by picking up an expensive  
product that has no benefit.

But I like your idea of measuring the surface charge; that would  
definitely help settle the matter.

Happy Trails,
