Subject: Where to buy a rebuilt engine near Baltimore

I have just blown a 83 Vanagon air cooled 2 L and am
wondering if there are any places near here where i
can pick up a rebuilt one quickly and for a good
price.  So far, it looks like I may need to drive up
to Bus Depot to get one since it is the closest I have
found so far and the best price.  Time is a factor, I
am at my parents house and need to get back to Denver
so I need something in a day or two.

Keep it positive
