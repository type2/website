I've searched the archives and pmailed a couple of you with limited success 
so thought I'd resort to the list. I know this has come up before.  Trying 
to tighten up my steering this weekend, I came across a horrific sight- a 
very large crack (1/2 cm wide- I could see the bolt through it) in my 
steering coupling flange.  The flexible square disc above it actually looks 
good.  Sooo, I'm looking for advice from folks who have replaced them.  My 
sense from Bentley is that I can remove the steering column assembly as a 
unit, without removing the steering wheel, etc. and not have to remove the 
steering box.  How about electricals?  Will I need to disconnect the 
wiper/directional/ignition wires to get to this?  Any other advice?

Parts I'll need?
coupler flange I believe is 211 415 409 and coupler disc I believe is 211 
415 417.  should bolts be replaced too?

Thanks kindly
Patrick
