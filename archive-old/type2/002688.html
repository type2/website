Subject: Re: [T2] DM revisited was Windshield Runaround


I think Doc's principle is correct here. Sure there are exceptions (real
german air in the tires, a modern blaupunkt over a damn AMsquawker...), but
his DM is timeless.  Gamble on the windshield and get on with it, but when
it comes to starters, master cylinders, AFM's, exhausts, etc, his words will
haunt you and revisit your mind one icy cold midnight when your broke down
16 miles from Timbuckedthree!  Why you'll quote some of his DM posts even in
your cozy garage as you change your third 'dollar zone' coil and wonder why
you're broke.
Point: Be darn careful about where you cheat. Don't let one windshield put
you on a slippery slope where you end up driving a Kia while your GEX
(non-)powered volks-something bus sits crying chinese-made tears!
I think we all mostly get this.
Now, what would be wrong with finding a non-clouded ORIGINAL windshield for
ten bucks in a boneyard?
Nurse Jay Schmidt(genuine German last name)hahahahaha!
PS: Keep lecturing Doc!  Und alles!
