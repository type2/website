Subject: Re: [T2] Re: MPH/Top Speed

Well, I might be a &quot;bit&quot; dramatic... heheh. The Bus does move, I've got all 
new steel fuel lines to replace those old fabric (?) lines... it does scoot 
along. I'd have to say that it accelerates similarly to like a 1984 Toyota 
Corolla. Cruising at 65-70 is not a problem. It's just that in South 
Florida, everyone has a tendancy to floor it from the light. It's unlike 
anything I've ever seen in any other city, including Boston, Northern 
Virginia (DC Metro Area), Chicago... for some reason, every light is a Grand 
Prix of (wherever we are). People floor it at every light, so... if you're 
not giving it at least 3/4 throttle you've got people riding your butt.

&gt; Dunno if it's a year thing or you've got a bad engine (or a smaller 
&gt; engine - mines a 2L), the bus has no problem traveling that speed unless 
&gt; you're engine is pretty badly out of tune.
&gt;
&gt; If any of you really want to see what kinda tune your engine is in, get 
&gt; yourself a wideband o2 sensor.
