The first photo on this page.

The motor is upside down, but it may be helpful. I made the same swap, from
'79 to '72-'74. Karl has this memorized, but there are, as I recall 4 pieces
that you need, the two lower covers, the front one in your post, and the
left rear. Plus you need the left heater pipe that attaches to the booster
fan hose.

#10 on the microfiche page is a cylinder cooling duct, it is common to all
years with type IV motor, so you probably have it already, it attaches under
the head and cylinder, above (up is up) the pushrod tubes.
