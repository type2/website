Hi everyone:
    My  69 westy has a 1600 dp engine w/ 34pict3 carb and am looking to
replace the 009 distributor with a stock one. I have two problems (I
have others but they are between my therapist and I). The first is I
don't know what the part number for the stock distributor is, and the
second problem is that I don't know where I would get one if I did know
the number. I seems like the catalogs that I have only sell the 009. I
don't know if if it matters, but the engine # is H 5 037 296. If anyone
knows what year and type that engine is I wouldn't mind knowing.

Thanks in advance,
Jeff

PS:  Does anyone know what this chassis number is 239 002 142? I can't
find mention of it in my reference materials.
