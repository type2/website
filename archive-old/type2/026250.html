Subject: RE: [T2] thumping

 
--Bob,

I will do as you say, but I must say that the problem occurs only right as I get underway and my gut feel is that it is from the power train. The vibration is much faster than the speed the wheels are rotating.It also lessens if I use more gas and get off the clutch more slowly. Could I be choking the engine in some way?

&gt;
&gt;Please check your wheels and tyres as soon as possible. Check for bulges or
&gt;other irregularities in the tyres which could indicate an immanent blow out.
&gt;
&gt;Then jack up each wheel in turn and see if its loose - you must jack the van
&gt;up as the weight of the vehicle will make a loose wheel appear to be tight.
&gt;
&gt;Both of the above will cause thumping at low speed which will disappear at
&gt;higher speeds.
&gt;
&gt;On a less alarmist note - it could simply be that you have lost a balancing
&gt;weight off of the wheel, if you cannot see where then swapping the wheels in
&gt;sequence using the spare would show which tyre is the duff one. Running for
&gt;a prolonged length of time with unbalanced wheels will cause problems to the
&gt;other mechanical parts.
&gt;
&gt;Certainly the first two possibilities above should be checked before driving
&gt;the van again; and I'm sure other listees will come up with other ideas
&gt;
&gt;Good luck

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;anybody know why I might have a thumping noise accompanied by serious
&gt;vibration when I'm getting going in first? Seems like the clutch might be
&gt;slipping but my bug driving friend was telling me that that sound is a high
&gt;pitched squeal. thoughts?
