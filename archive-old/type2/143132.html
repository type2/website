Subject: Re: [T2] Timing revisited

&gt; When I
&gt; got it home this time and checked the timing with my static light again,
&gt; this time it's reading 6 degrees BTDC.


#1: I didn't know you could static time with that kind of accuracy!
#2: What work was done at the shop? Points replaced? Adjusted? Something
similar? The reason I asked is if they replaced the points, they may have
forgotten to retime after installation and that would cause a discrepancy
between before and after.
