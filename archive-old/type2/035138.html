Subject: Bus for Sale

I can't believe I'm doing this but I have no choice...
Will also trade for a 70-73..that runs but needs
interior work plus $2500. In other words..your bus
plus 2500 gets mine. Please help..need Cash ASAP.

73 Westy..dual carbs(just rebuilt), New pop top
canvas, CD player and speakers,
    electronic ignition. Runs perfect..has 1978 2L
engine. Due to unforseen
    circumstances, I must sell my bus. I'm not happy
about it. Must pay debt..Must
    sell bus quickly. The price is not negotionable.
Check out pics at the link below. It
    is the orange bus..not the school bus yellow one.
Eme if interested.
