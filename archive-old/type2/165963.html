Subject: Trip report: Peterborough Bus Volk Festival

Hi Volks,

This past weekend was quite possibly the best VW event launch I have
ever attended.  Jerry Baldwin started planning this event back before
BusFusion, and found a great location, matched up the date with some
excellent local festivities and put the word out. The result was
excellence;  through and through.

Highlights:
- Packing the bus for two. There is so much more space that way, and
we had forgotten what that feels like. The kids stayed home and it
was still in one piece when we returned this afternoon.

- Discovering a new campground, practically in our own backyard. The
place has good facilities and seems to be very accomodating.

- Good weather. It rained a bit, but not during anything important.
Today's weather for the music festival was magnificent.

-Gerry's stretch vanagon. Definitely a 10/10 execution. Everyone who
saw it immediately wanted one for themselves.

- Discovering some new musicians to keep an eye on.


Two thumbs up and a big thanks to Jerry and Sophie for a job very
well done!
