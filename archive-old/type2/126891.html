Subject: Re: [T2] fuel filler neck advisory

LOL very important thing there richard thankx for the pics...
i just ordered one from bus depot few weeks back and installed it the other day ...
i had to put wood and such under my pipe for the fact that my boot was already gone and looked like it had been soaked in acid all around the gas cap side of things..
wished i had a pic of it.. made yours look brand new... was really scary...
ahhh the smell of gas LOL&gt;....
yes very important thing to change and not the easiest to get to thats for sure..
 
i had to take the pipe off my tank and stick the rubber boot on and get a few fingers from outside the gas cap to fit so that i could pull it up and through the gas cap hole where it surrended to install...
 
is the one from the depot the same thickness as the one you got ...?
this one i got seems alot thicker than that of the old that came out of it...
 
it was eat up really bad  and was spilling gas everywhere when i made right turns it seems.. sloshing back up the pipe....
 
all is good now ,,,,,,,,'
peace
Chris

I took a peek at the fuel filler neck I put on 2 years ago and it gave me a
scare:

At the time this was all that was available. The shape was just like the
original but the rubber, like most reproduction items, is not up to job (my
buddy put that el cheapo clamp on and it didn't help matters).

I replaced it with the latest &quot;OE&quot; filler neck I bought from CIP1_dot_com.

FWIW, this new version has better mold markings than the other one and seems
thicker but the shape has been altered from the original:

You can see that it lacks the profile of the fuel filler pipe but otherwise
I think is an improvement. This one better last until the next engine pull.
