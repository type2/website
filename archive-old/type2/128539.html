Subject: Re: [T2] Re: MORE paint questions

&lt;&lt;Everything we do has consequences. But I'm not going to miss sleep
over a paint-job. 
If you can't afford to repaint a tremclad encrusted bus properly there
are two options: 
1. Find another bus. 
2. Throw another coat of tremclad at it. 
As long as what I do with my bus is not putting someone else at risk,
it's really none of their business.

Boy, your right on the money here Greg--do whatever floats your boat--
 
However--if a guy puts on the wrong set of tire's, spark plugs that he
thinks is good for him and his vehicle-runs some oil that isn't accepted
by popular consensus--a bunch of folks are down the offender's throat--

So, in my opinion--this situation is in the same ballpark-

Why go through all the motions and use substandard materials and
application devises--and wind up with just an OK squirt job?

In reality I have found that it really doesn't cost one more dime to fly
first class--
