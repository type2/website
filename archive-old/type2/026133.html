Some of you will remember my post a few weeks back about a strange clanking
noise coming from the rear of my bus.  I have fixed it now.  It was one of
the legs off the table rolling back and forth under the back seat.
HAHAHAHAHA....  That was easy, I didn't even get my hands dirty.  The most
annoying thing is that I thought it was something loose in a cupboard the
first time, but I didn't know I'd left the leg in there.

This reminds me, a friend had a knocking sound on his car while going round
corners, he was convinced it was a bad CV joint and even pinpointed which
joint it was.  Only after cleaning and repacking the (perfectly good) joint
did he find out it was the exhaust knocking against the car.

I may be turning into a type 2 hypochondriac, do I need therapy?
