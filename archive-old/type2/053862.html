&gt; Hello all,
&gt; As I might have mentioned before, I'm an artist. I teach oil painting at
&gt; Southern Utah University. I've been painting for about as long as I've
been
&gt; involved w/ VW's. But it wasn't until Ron, from the Bus Depot, advertised
&gt; that he was looking for an artist to do an illustration for his new
catalog
&gt; that I considered painting a VW.
&gt; Although I was working w/ acrylics and painting quite small (91/2&quot; x 11&quot;),
I
&gt; was quite pleased w/ the outcome
&gt; (any of you see the new catalog yet?).
&gt;
&gt; The idea occurred to me that maybe some of you Bus owners out there would
&gt; like an original oil painting of your Bus in some memorable, bucolic or
&gt; otherwise art worthy location. I work from photographs, so the overall
&gt; strength of the painting would depend upon the strength of the photo.
&gt;
&gt; I know most of you (me included) spend your hard earned cash on keeping
your
  baby on the road. But if you're a collector of art and
 have a favorite photo of your Bus at your
&gt; favorite fishing hole or camping spot - an original oil painting for the
&gt; garage or office could be inspiring?
&gt;
&gt; A (approx.) 18&quot;x24&quot; oil would take 2 to 3 weeks to complete. I'm anal
&gt; retentive and a sucker for detail. Depending on complexity of the image
the
&gt; paintings would run about $500.00. Any style between Photo-realism and
Abstract Expressionism. If this is something any of you would
&gt; like to do, we could work out the details individually.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for listing to my sales pitch.
