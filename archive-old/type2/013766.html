Hello List,

I want to thank you for all of the helpful suggestions
that you gave me on my bus that would not fire after
the engine was washed. I will have to put them to good
use. With alittle bit of luck and patience, she will
wake back up. Thanks again for you wisdom!

David Kelly,
From Wilmington, North Carolina
