Subject: RE: ArmourAll

&gt; Subject: What's the matter with ArmourAll?
&gt; 
&gt; A while back a listee said something like  &quot;...Armour All is terrible for
&gt; your dashboard.&quot;  Why?  What's the long term downside and do you know of a
&gt; product that cleans/shines like that stuff, but doesn't do the bad stuff?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.

	[Crick, Bill ]  Bill Crick's reply:
	I once talked to a fellow who had a biz replacing vinyl tops
	(remember vinyl tops?). He told me that Armor- All was the 
	best thing that ever happened to his bizness. Armor-All got very
	popular and his biz more than doubled, and almost everyone
	coming in with a bad roof now claimed they had taken good care 
	of it using ArmorAll.
	He tried ArmourAll on one half of a car in a scrap yard near his
shop.
	A few years later, the side he had treated was in tatters
	 
	Don't do it!
