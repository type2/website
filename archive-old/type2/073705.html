&gt;I can't understand how I was so fortunate to have gotten by so long with
&gt;so little maintenance.

German metalurgy and design can withstand lack of maintenance better that
anything else made. The cost of replacing that high quality metal is of
course much higher. Higher specs=higher cost=longer life. Add proper
maintenance and that life can be rediculously long. If you wish to try to
save money by doing minimal maintenance and throw it away in well less than
half the life even modest maintenance will give it, well, that works for
some people. That's why Japanese vehicles sell so well. They are designed
for minimal maintenance, wear it out in 150K, then throw it away. It's a
new attitude that is becoming pervasive. Just note how many 30+ year old
vehicles are still on the road. Very few Japanese, though they sold 5 if
not 10 times as many as Euro vehicles back then. 

I must have at least a half dozen millionairs who bring their 30+ year old
Mercedes to me to continue the maintenance they have insisted upon through
the years since they bought it new. No, these aren't big time real estate
developers or other high faluting folks, just wage earners retired from
common vocations. The money they saved from not buying new vehicles every 3
to 5 years has been accruing interest in their investment accounts all
through those years. That's why they are millionairs founded upon middle
income wages, they knew best how to not waste money. Their cost per mile is
less than 1/5th the cost of the low/no maintenance types eating the
depreciation inherent in the throwaway mentality.
