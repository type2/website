Subject: [T2] Flywheel won't stop spinning

Hey all,
   I have a question about my flywheel.  I have a 78' baywindow FI.  
When I come to a stop and try to go into reverse, all I get is 
grinding.  Sometimes if I put shifter into 3rd or 4th gear and then 
go to reverse it will let me in with out grinding.  But most of the 
time it wont stop spinning and I get grinding.  Leaving me to turn 
the engine off to put it into reverse.  Anyone have and ideas on 
whats goin on or what to do to solve this problem??  Thanks for your 
help.
