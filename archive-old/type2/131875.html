Subject: Re: [T2] Gaskets for air distribution box?

Thanks Richard! Most helpful. I appreciate the pictures of the EGR valve.
Unfortunatly there are no porsche dealers in Northern Arizona. Does anyone
recommend someone on the web for porsche parts comparable to Bus Depot?
It's people like you who make &quot;doing it right&quot; possible!

&gt; &gt; Can I make the gaskets for the EGR valve and cold start inj. from bulk 
&gt; &gt; gasket
&gt; &gt; material?
