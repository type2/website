Subject: Re: [T2] trying to get engine in my 71

&gt;Can you see your throttle cable?

Yea, I've already fed it through the fan shroud.  Also, someone mentioned if 
i had changed anything, and no I havnen't. Just replaced the heads, didn't 
touch the clutch or flywheel.

Tranny seems to be level as well as the engine.
