Subject: new longblock, questions

hello list,

I just finished putting a 2.0L hyd. lifter longblock in my '77 bus (FI) last
night. It's sooooooo great to be driving the bus again. While driving
however, i occasionally get a momentary loss of power. power comes right
back. every once in a while it'll do that a couple times at once. this is
only when i have my foot on the accelerator. i personally suspect the fuel
filter is clogged.

i replaced all of the fuel lines except for the fatter one between the
filter and pump. it need replacing, which i'd like to do along with the fuel
filter. does anyone know what size fuel line that is??

also, what are the symptoms of a sticking dist. breaker plate??  how can i
tell if the vac canister is any good?
i know i can point the timing light at it and push the throttle. what else
can i check out??

also what kinda oil should i have in it for the first few hundred miles??  i
have quaker state 20W-50 right now for the breakin). normally i use castrol
HD SAE 30.

also, when should i schedule my first few oil changes??  should i just do
the first one at 300 mi when i pull the engine to torq head studs?  the
engine did the 20 minute test run at AVP.

also, what's the SAFEest thing to spray at the FI system to check for vac
leaks?? and where can i get the elbow that runs from the AFM to the throttle
body. RMMW has the one for 70s beetles with l-jetronic FI, but not for
buses. mine has a crack, that i tried to seal up with gasket maker and duct
tape. haven't checked it for vac leak yet.

that's all the questions i can think of right now.
thanks to AVP, bus depot (even tho they screwed up a couple orders), my
little brother who helped me out, my mom who put up with this sh*t in her
garage, and por15 who didn't help with the engine at all, just the rusty
roof. that's all the ppl i could think of to thank right now. oh, and dave
(i think that's his name) who's always on irc.type2_dot_com answering my stupid
questions.

on the road again,
Marko and Edna the '77 loaf with a new engine
