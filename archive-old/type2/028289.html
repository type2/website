Volks-

I'm currently troubleshooting a refusal to start by my '79 California bus
(all stock AFAIK).  Spark seems to be there but the plugs come out wet with
gas, so I'm thinking that something is making things run way, way too rich.
I've been trying to follow Bentley's test procedures for various components.
When I tested the AFM, terminals 7 &amp; 8 came up with no connection, so I
opened up the thing and found that the wiper thingees weren't making good
contact with the plate.  I bent the wipers a bit to make them press against
the plate harder, and now have about 200 ohms across 7 &amp; 8, which is just
within spec.

Now to my real question.  I figured that as the wiper moved across the
plate, there ought to be smoothly changing resistance as measured between
terminal 7 (which connects to the wiper) and one of the other terminals.
This doesn't seem to be happening. Instead, the resitance seems to jump all
over the place as the wiper moves from one end of the plate to the other. I
even connected my ohmeter directly to the wiper and the resistive surface of
the plate - same result.  I assume this is Not Good(tm), but wondered if
anyone had any useful information on normal values.  Also (since I'll
probably need it), anyone know a good source for a remanufactured '79 Cal
AFM (Bosch 0 280 200 022)?  I found new ones at Bus Depot, but they're $300!

Thanks,
Alistair
'79 Westy
