Subject: Hub cap status

hi ;) 
        Just giving everyone the skinny on the hub cap status.  
   This weekend I will be driving it up to Lake Okeechobee FL to hand it off 
to Rich Van Baalen to start its journey back north.  Due to some logistics, a 
bad bus engine, and a sign up member being MIA, I've had it longer than I 
like, but it's moving again!
       I'm sorry to say that I was unable to get a picture at the 
southernmost Continental US marker because its under construction.  A big 
gray piece of concrete is not that nice of picture, but I did take some nice 
pictures of it with my 4 year old son Smokey (a Volkswagen nut) at the 
southern most continental VW shop.  (Hans Hamel Motors)
