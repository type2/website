Subject: Re: [T2] flywheel seal



I use a light coating of Hylomar on the seal (make sure it's the red one).  
So far, no leaks in the engines I've done it to.  Four years and counting on 
the last one.  In order to check the endplay, you'll need a dial indicator.  
Do any of the  FLAPS rent them?  If not, Sears or Harbor Freight should have 
them.

so i took the engine out, did a bunch of maint. including but not
limited to replacing the flywheel seal. drove the bus about 1000
miles on vacation. now i have a pretty major oil leak from between
the eng. and trans. (flywheel seal). i have not removed the eng.
again (too hot in houston)what i need to know is there some trick to
replacing this seal? i dont want to have to re re do it. i also want
to know how to check the end play while i have the flywheel off
again. this is a gex rebuild installed by p.o. 1600sp upright eng..
