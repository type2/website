Subject: Bus AC report

If anyone has a working bus AC unit, would you mind giving me a performance
report?

I have been working on my '76 westy putting all the AC components in it,
but I really don't want to put in the under dash unit.  I would like to run
the AC camped as well as on the road, so I am planning on putting the
overhead unit in.  I know the unit will extend back into the hole in the
roof, but I will try to make it work.

What I want to know is, does the overhead unit have the power to cool the
bus in really hot weather?
