Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Line Routing and type

When I replaced my '71 Bus's fuel line, if I recall correctly, I removed a
portion of the metal line which was nearly worn through, but retained a
straight run of metal line through the fan housing.  I'm pretty sure that I've
heard of people running the flexible line all the way, but I'm not sure
whether they use a different route.

So, I'd love to hear responses to this one, too.
