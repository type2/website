Subject: Happy Friday - Bus encounter...


Morning, list:

So yesterday my 2 year old son and I stop at a house not far away where there's a positively
annihilated 71 passenger bus out front, it's been there for about a year - the DEADEST bus you've
ever seen...this time we peek in to survey the damage and I see, in perfect, showroom shape, one of
the few missing parts of my bus, which is the air vent with the armrest on it that screws to the
front door panel.  So we go to the door to inquire about buying it maybe, and the CRAZIEST looking
hundred and twenty year old man flings open the door and before I can get one word out he yells,
&quot;Now dammit!  For the last ****ing time!  I am not selling that bus!  Can't you see I'm fixing it
up!?  If one more person asks me if they can buy my bus, I'm gonna shoot em off the porch!!  (He
really said this)... SLAM!

So...... I guess that's a good thing.  Here's a bus so beat the wrecking yard might not take it, but
this old man, he's gonna bring it back to life!
