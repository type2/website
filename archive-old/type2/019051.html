volks enthusiasts,
thanks for your input everyone, I think i will probly go with the
aftermarket ragtop.  I have no money at the moment but when i do i will
do the conversion (pop top to ragtop), i have other things that are a
priority though, like getting an engine and ordering and welding in body
panels, but i thought i would run the sunroof/rag top thing by the list
here and see what all u guys/gals had to say. thanks for the input.
anyone know of the cheapest place in Canada to order body panels from?
