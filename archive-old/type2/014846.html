--part1_2b.1a0ba302.28b16486_boundary

I have been trying for several months to get my refer on my 77 Westy to work 
on AC.

If works fine off the battery, even gets cold, but only works a short time on 
AC and then the light goes out. 

I downloaded the diagnostics from the type2 site and searched the archives 
but to no avail. 

It would pass the diagnostics and still not work. After messing with it for a 
couple of hours yesterday, I finally isolated the problem. The power 
converter works intermittently. Hence the pass of diagnostics only to have it 
not work later. 

I am replacing the converter on Monday.

I hope this helps anyone with a similar problem.
