&gt;Inner tubes from bikes are also commonly available,
&gt;and you don't have to crawl along the side of a
&gt;trucking route to find them.

Also check your local motorcycle shop... dirt bikes &amp;
ATV's still use tubes, and when I worked the parts
counter we always had a couple old ones laying around
for customers who wanted them...
