Subject: Re: [T2] Electric winch for pulling T2's

&gt;	We've picked up an enclosed car hauler that is tall enough for T2's
&gt;to fit in.  Since I can imagine that the car being hauled may not be running
&gt;in most cases, I am having an electric winch installed in the front of it.
&gt;My question is, do I need a 6000# winch to pull a bus onto a car hauler or
&gt;can I go with something smaller?  The ramp is 6' long and the slope of the
&gt;ramp is not bad at all.

Isn't the cable going to rub on the trailer before the bus gets up on the ramps? How high up are you going to mount it?

The last and only time I put my bus on a proper trailer...

...we found that the built-in ramps were too short to allow the bumper the clear before the wheels hit the ramps. We ended up using some longer ramps you can see in this photo:

They weren't ideal (flexed too much) and not properly mounted to the trailer (be careful they do go flying out from under a rear wheel) but I didn't know they were going to be used before the trailer showed up.
