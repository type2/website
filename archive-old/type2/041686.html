Landon sends:

&gt; I keep hearing about Porsche engines, V6's, Japanese motors, hydraulic
&gt; lifters and electronic ignitions, rubberbands used by NASA and hamsters on
&gt; Crack being used.

I think I'd stay away from the NASA rubberbands and crack-addicted hamsters.
The engine I'm currently building, which will contain no small animal
content, is a 2.3 litre containing 96mm pistons and one of John Connolly's
counterweighted Type 4 cranks, along with one of his split-duration
camshafts, dual Webers and a good Pertronix/CDI electronic ignition. (Or, if
any relatives should happen to leave me huge sums of money between now and
when the Bus goes back on the road, an MSD system.)
