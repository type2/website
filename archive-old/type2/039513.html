Subject: Yamabond?

I'm curious...do you apply this Yamabond stuff directly to the 
pushrod o-rings? how else do you use it? I'm having flashbacks to the 
days when 3-M gorilla snot was the all-purpose cureall.

Having been a Triumph Bonneville owner in the wayback days I'm leery 
of using any gasket compound whatsover. (Developed a fairly high 
threshold for oil leaks too, I suppose.)
