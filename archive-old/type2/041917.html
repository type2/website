Subject: Re:External Oil Cooler (AKA New Long Thread)

Hey Volks,

I've been running an axilliary plate-type oil cooler on my '78 Westy for
about 7 years now. It's mounted underneath, driver's side, about halfway
between rear and front wheels. Not flush with the bottom, but
approximately even with the lowest edge of the unibody panels. No fan. I
used bands of &quot;plumber's friend&quot; strip metal to span the distance between
two crossbeams on the underside of the bus and attached the cooler to
those with the rubber flexi-mounts provided.  There is about 3&quot; airspace
above the cooler, so air can (presumably) move through it freely. It's
parallel (not perpendicular ) to the airflow, but I couldn't think of an
elegant way to set the thing parallel to airflow anywhere. It seems to get
plenty of air though. With an oil filter mounted on a bracket right next
to the cooler. Oil goes in/out of an adaptor where my stock oil filter
would have gone. 5/8&quot;  hoses, for the same reasons you mentioned. It takes
about 8' of hose to get to and from the cooler. 

My bus runs about 30-50 degrees F cooler than it used to. Oil pressure is 
around 50-60psi when running at normal operating temp. I've had a little 
bit of trouble with very low volume oil leaks from hose fittings at the 
engine point of attachment. I once made an air scoop out of an old 
plastic fuel can that fit over the cooler and hung about 2 1/2&quot; below it, 
to scoop air through the cooler and (presumably) enhance cooling. I 
didn't notice any decrease in operating oil temp with the scoop and it 
caught on a rock and was ripped off without a trace the first time I went 
offroad with it in Baja CA.

If I had it all to do over again, I would upgrade the type of hosing I
used. There are at least 3 grades of rubber oil hose. I used the least
expensive one, which is black. Higher grade hoses are stiffer. One grade
is red. I can't remember what color the other is. I think upgrading hose
would possibly reduce incidence of leaking at connectors because hoses
would make a tighter fit to the hose bibs. If you want to do this to Bob
Hoover type specs you might consider the braided metal hose and aircraft
engine-type fittings. That would up the cost substantially, but presumably
eliminate any pesky leakage. Metal hose might enhance cooling too, but I'm
not sure. 

Subaru fan ought to work fine, but seems like mine works fine without it. 
Those fans block passive airflow to the cooler and they suck lots of 
current when they're on, which must add to the engine's heat load. With 
anything on the bottom of the bus, you need to think about having it low 
enough to get good airflow, but high enough to not get whacked by stuff 
you drive over with reduced clearance. 

Good luck. Sounds like you're doing a good thorough job of it.

Drive safely,
