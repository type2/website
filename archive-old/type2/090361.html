Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Pop Top Fiasco / Etiquitte

&gt; Isn't that what this list is for?  Advice?   There is nothing
&gt; personal against Ron or anyone else.  I am only a customer looking
&gt; for the best supplier.   If vendor problems are off-limits to this
&gt; list (as they are on some others I belong to) that needs to be made
&gt; clear to people joining the list.

No vendor problems are not out of line. Some of us that have seen the same
posts come around again for the xx time forget thats its new to many
of you. Bus Depot is a good vendor. Ive had problems a few times and Ron,
when personally informed, has always made it right by me. He cares, they
try, they are cheap and dont try to fool you about the quality.
