[...]

I'm betting you have problems far more severe than a bum starter.

VW crankshafts get bent by much lighter hits than yours took, especially
since you say it was impacted right on the pulley.

Whether or not any repairs involve an insurance company [probably yours
since it was a hit and run], get that engine checked out very thoroughly by
a knowledgeable VW machinist, etc.

If you wish to discuss this further please write to me directly [or check
out the Type 2 archives].

&gt;&gt;  ...my van got rammed in the rear as it wa parked on the side of the road
a couple weeks ago.  The guy left
without leaving a note.  It looked as though he was trying to turn to miss
and his front right corner nailed my van centered right on the rear
crankshaft pulley knocking the van 6 feet forward.  After i got all sheet
metal off i was hopeful that the engine was not actually damaged.  It turns
fine but i was still dealing with my starter problem.  &lt;&lt;
