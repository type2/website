Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Degreaser

&gt; I want to brush it off, then wipe dry.  I looked at 
engine degreasers at
&gt; FLAPS but they want me to hose it off.  Don't wanna do 
it.
&gt; 
&gt; Thoughts please.

Por-15's Marine Clean works rather well. What is your 
reason for not wanting to use the hose? Are you 
concerned with washing the grease/oil down the sewer? If 
so consider the local self serve carwash, most recycle 
the water. IMHO using mineral spirits or kerosene would 
leave your driveway a big mess, not to mention the time 
you'd spend breathing those lovely fumes.
