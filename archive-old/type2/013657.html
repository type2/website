[CCing the list as it may do somebody some good]

Mr. Winkert and I are having a discussion about whether you ought to 
pack a fuel pump with grease. Winkert is correct, both Bill Bowman's 
article in the Library, and Muir, recommend packing the bottom end of 
the fuel pump with grease (I cannot find it in Bentley). They mean the 
plastic part and the pushrod which extend into the case.

Normally these are lubricated with engine oil and (somebody tell me if 
I'm wrong) it is not necessary to do this in the case of a routine 
replacement of the top half of the fuel pump (the pump part).

In any case I did not want any newbies to go squirting grease into the 
brass part of a fuel pump. Do not do that. That would be a very bad 
idea. Daniel Winkert probably knew that perfectly well and is way ahead 
of me. =^)

&gt;&gt;&gt; 1.I have moly grease and disc brake grease in my collection - will
&gt;&gt;&gt; either of these do or should I get something else, specifically what -
&gt;&gt;&gt; to pack in the pump when I put it in?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; (?) Do not pack a fuel pump with grease. Where did this come from? I
&gt;&gt; hope it's not in the Library or something. You might choose to pack an
&gt;&gt; oil pump with Vaseline in the case of a rebuild, but do not pack a fuel
&gt;&gt; pump.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Just install it with the gaskets, it should be fine.
