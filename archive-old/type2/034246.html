Subject: Re: What years use same gas tank as '71?

I believe '68-71 gas tanks are the same. That said, I think you could also
use a '72-75 tank with minor adjustments to the venting system and filler
neck hose. The critical piece I would investigate is the filler neck hose,
since I suspect the placement may be slightly different between '71 and
'72. I'm pretty certain you'd be able to use the early ('68-71) filler neck
hose that's already in your bus--if it's still good--but check and be sure
that the tank inlets are in the same place on both tanks. I believe the
'72-on tanks also have an additional, larger vent in the top, center, rear
(toward the back of the bus) portion of the tank. This will need to be
capped, but you can probably just put a cork in it, as long as you keep the
rest of the venting lines intact. This may also exist on the '68-71 tanks;
I just can't remember. Hmmm...maybe the '68-75 tanks are identical with
only the filler neck hose changing...

Venting is critical to compensate for the expansion and contraction of fuel
and to provide for a smooth flow of fuel into the engine. However, you must
not allow fuel or vapors to be released freely into your bus or engine
compartment because of the associated dangers. That's why the venting
system in the bus is so important.

You could probably also use a '62-'67 tank, but you would have to cut the
filler neck (which *I* consider dangerous) and you'd be loosing fuel
capacity. And these earlier tanks are not vented--that would leave you with
the likelihood that at some time your tank would spill gas through filler
neck (expansion) and at other times it might become vapor locked (unless
the cap was vented).

The '76-79 tanks have an additional fuel outlet for FI, which would need to
be capped in some way. If you drove a '72 or later, I would probably
recommend the '76-79 tank and tell you to do the work to cap the additional
outlet. The reason I would do this is because you would be giving yourself
more flexibility in case you decide to go to fuel injection. It could also
serve as a feed to a gas heater.

Hope I've lent assistance and not confusion. Since I don't know your
situation and what options you have sitting in front of you (e.g., great
deal on a pristine tank of certain vintage), I figured I'd lay out as much
detail as I could. I'm going to go away now and ponder why I seem know so
much about fuel tanks from various years and why it bothers me that I can't
be positive of some of this knowledge. This smacks of obsession and
conoissuership (in the classical sense), but I'm certain I'm not a
bus-addict. In fact, I remain on this list largely to help those of you who
are. ;)

Have fun! Joe
