&gt;However, if you DRIVE in too long a gear, your engine IS overheating while

This last concern is especially true with auto trans.  The auto won't
downshift until revs are very low, and going up long hills in hot weather
can get engine temps up pretty high in short order.  If you've got an auto,
you REALLY need temp gauges.
