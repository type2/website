Subject: Fan housing/dipstick question

***story first, question at the end***

STORY HERE:
Apparently I spoke too soon in my earlier post.  Major complication #1
has arisen!

It seems I've got myself a fan housing from a 914.  Makes sense, really
since the engine was a 914.  I never stopped to consider they'd be
different, though.

What's the big diff?  One word.  Dipstick.  I'm refering to the actual
oil measurement instrument, not myself nor the PO who put the 914 engine
in (and did many other unspeakable things to the electrical system).
914 engines fill and are checked from the top--by the oil breather, for
you unknowing bus folk.  Of course, this is a real drag if you're a bus
owner, since you gotta check the oil through the overhead hatch.

So I'm dreaming of being able to check my oil on my new engine through
the rear engine hatch, like normal bus folks.  Then it dawns on me that
the fan housing blocks the filler hole.  Hmm.  I look, double check.
Yep.  I'd have to go through the fan housing to put the dipstick in the
hole.  Unfortunately, my 914 fan housing complicates the issue.


QUESTION HERE:
The question is for you busfolk with real bus engines and fan housings:
is there a pipe THROUGH the fan housing which connects to the oil filler
tube?  Or can I just drill a couple of holes and call it good?  A pipe
would be more elegant, though, and probably compromise the cooling
system less.  All thoughts on this matter are appreciated.  Bentley,
Haynes, Muir, and Wilson aren't any help.

BTW, thanks to those of you who sent me encouragement on my earlier
post.
