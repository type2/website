Subject: still a brake booster nightmare

Dear list,

    Recently installed a booster that I bought used (dug

out from a potato field, full of rust) I was sure it would 

work or not. So I installed it and checked with a vacuum 

gauge per the library and it checked OK. Vacuum stayed

 at 18 at idle and when I stepped on the brake it stayed.

Cool HuH! Well I went out the next morning for work

and my bus would not stay running. Sounded like I was 

on 1 cylinder and back firing through the carb. Hmmm

vacuum leak????? Check valve good, no hissing when 

I push on the brake nothing. I have not been able to 

check with the vacuum gauge because I couldn't keep 

it running long enough. Suggestions??? I'm thinking of 

going back to my old booster  while awaiting rebuild, but I really

think that I screwed something up. A friend said maybe

my carb is so far out of adjustment from the old booster

but I'm not sure. Please help, I have been fighting this 

booster thing for quite some time now. I have check and 

rechecked my connections and can't for the life of my

bus figure this out.  Does a massive vacuum leak cause 

this one cylinder condition?? Can I check the booster off

with a vacuum pump???? I have bugged just about everyone

this list and I need help!!!!!!!!!!!!
