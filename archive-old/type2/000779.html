Subject: bolt-on valve covers??

Greetings Bussers,

I need to do the ritual spring
tune-up on my '73 Westy &quot;Baloo&quot;.
It has the flat 1800 motor and 
the chore is actually an easy and enjoyable
ritual. However, I find myself procrastinating 
because of the hassle I inevitably get with the 
valve covers and gaskets. I just know
that one will leak after the adjustment
and require one or two messy corrections
before it works (if it ever really seals perfectly!)

I carefully clean the cover, use cork gaskets, and
carefully use some gasket-forming permatex between 
the gasket and cover to keep it in place. But alas,
one side always seems to leak. (I think that if I was doing
something seriously wrong, I would have both leaking and
a year-long problem rather than a slow leak on one side.
Or a major leak immediately after installation - as I always
dread and frequently experience.)

So what does the collective wisdom of the list 
recommend? (I tried the archives without success).
a) new valve covers for a better mating surface?
b) different gaskets??
or as I am pondering:

c) has anyone tried the kits to convert from the
   bail-tension design to the bolt-ons?
   (this is an intriquing idea, but are they hard to
   install or prone to failure??)


Any advise or experiences appreciated before I
commit to a plan for this year's spring preparations.


Thanks very much,

Mike Dulany
