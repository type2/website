&gt;I'm going to replace the filter and then do a pressure check, but I 
&gt;won't be able to get to that for a couple of days.  What I'd like to 
&gt;know from the list is if it is normal to be able to hear the fuel pump 
&gt;running so clearly from the cockpit.

If it's making a grinding noise it needs to be replaced. You shouldn't be able to hear it over the engine . When the engine is off and you activate the pump manually by depressing the flap in the AFM it makes a smooth whirring normal sounding motor noise.
