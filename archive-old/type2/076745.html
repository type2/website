Subject: Re: [T2] no keys &amp; steering lock (was new sunroof bus)

I just felt I should add to this:

The key for the ignition switch is the same as the front doors and the
locksmith can make a key from the door handle too. It is much more difficult
to get the ignition switch lock cylinder out of the steering column. Most
locksmiths have a mobile van so I would just have them come out to make a
key. Here is a good link for the procedure:

&gt; busdriver X,
&gt;
&gt; having just lost my keys at Oktoberbus, i had the exact same issues you
&gt; are describing. my bus is a 72 &amp; i will outline the steps we took to
&gt; get around no keys &amp; steering lock. but i honestly dont know the
differences
&gt; between your bus (79) &amp; mine, so please take that into account.
&gt;
&gt; first, remove the 4 screws that hold the steering column up to the dash.
&gt; pull the steering column towards the driver's seat.
&gt; look underneath &amp; you will see the electrical portion of the switch
attached
&gt; to the mechanical portion. there is a TINY screw that holds these 2 items
&gt; together &amp; it will need to be removed. (make sure you put it in a safe
place)
&gt; once the electrical portion of that switch is removed, you can start your
bus
&gt; with a smallish flathead screwdriver or similar tool.
&gt;
&gt; now on to steering lock. what you will need: a thin metal strip (we used a
&gt; cutout section of a beer can), a couple of plastic zippy ties, &amp; duct
&gt; tape (of course!)
&gt;
&gt; the steering lock seemed to be controlled by a spring-loaded button in
&gt;  the column. look on the backside of the column
&gt; underneath the steering wheel. that button must be fully depressed (&amp; stay
&gt; depressed) to disengage the steering lock. in order to press the button
down
&gt; we used a long, skinny flathead screwdriver. then take your thin metal
strip
&gt; &amp; wedge it between the button &amp; the screwdriver tip. you should now be
able
&gt; to remove the screwdriver as the metal strip is holding that button down.
&gt; use your plastic zippy ties to secure the metal strip in position on the
&gt; steering column.  use strips of duct tape to ensure the whole shebang
stays
&gt; in place (you dont want it falling out while you are driving!)
&gt;
&gt; almost done. when putting the steering column back into its original
position,
&gt; pull the electrical portion of the switch out towards you &amp; let it hang
freely.
&gt;
&gt; put the steering column back in its regular place &amp; resecure the 4 screws
&gt; holding it in.
&gt;
&gt; done.
&gt;
&gt; also, now that i think about it, while everything is taken apart that
would
&gt; probably be the best time to take out the mechanical portion of the
switch. i
&gt; would think you could take that to a locksmith &amp; they could probably make
&gt; a key for it.
&gt;
&gt; the whole thing took about 15-20 minutes. it took me longer to write up
&gt; these instructions than it did to get the job done.
&gt;
&gt; HTH.
