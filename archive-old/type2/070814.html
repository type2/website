Dear Volks

I have a '68 crewcab.  Apparently in the normal '68 bus (and probably other 
model year loafs) there is an air duct that goes across the front from the 
center to the left and right sides at about a foot above the floor.  Part of 
it on each side goes up to the vents in the dash.  Part apparently mates to a 
vent duct going through each door to provide vent air to the rear of the bus.

On the crewcab, the duct does not pass through the door.  Instead the duct is 
blocked off on each end by a metal plate approximately 4 x 6 inches.  My 
crewcab is missing the left hand plate.  Can someone who has a parts book or 
fiche tell me the part number for this?  Does anyone have one for sale or 
know a source for one?  I've tried Wilson's already.  For a part bus, it has 
to be either a single or double cab.

Thanks, David Hunt
