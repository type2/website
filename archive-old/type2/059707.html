Subject: Dual Weber ICT 34 questions:

I got a pair of Weber ICT 34 (aka 'baby Webers') at a swap meet for real
cheap.  I'm putting them on the 1776cc type I motor that I just built
for my 58 sc and have got a several questions about them:

1.  Will these be enough carb for my 1776cc engine (stock cam, '041'
heads)?  (or are they complete junk to begin with?)

2.  There is a port on each of the manifolds and the guy I bought them
from says to connect a rubber hose from one to the other.  Anybody know
if this is right and if so, what the heck is it's purpose?  And should I
disconnect it and/or plug it while balancing the carbs?

3.  I've always used a Synchrometer for balancing the dual 40 IDFs on my
type IV motors and love it.  But on the type I motor, the carbs sit so
high in the engine compartment (and it doesn't have that great access
hatch that the 73 and newer buses have) that I can't read it.  Does the
Unisyn tool work better in this situation?

4.  As far as I can tell, when balancing the carbs at a 1200 rpm idle,
my synchrometer is reading almost off the scale (20+).  At 1200 rpm on
my dual 40's, I typically see it reading around the 6 or 7 mark.  Is
this because I'm dealing with 1 throat per 2 cylinders now vs. 1 throat
per cylinder or am I doing something really wrong?

Sorry for all the questions, but I can't find anything about setting up
these carbs in either of my Weber books and I don't have the $$$
available for another set of IDF's right now so I really need to make
these work if I can.

Thanks in advance.
