They deliver fast and were cheaper than anywhere in town (including Discount 
Tire and Costco). Of course then you have to pay someone to mount them about 
15/each. Overall it was still cheaper for me.

I put the Michelin Agilis 61s on my 80 Vanagon Westy and love the way they 
look. They give the van a nice &quot;factory&quot; high ride/look. My van is up on 
blocks and I cant vouch for handling but I have seen nor heard anything 
negative on these tires. Everythng has been positive. Your bus might be 
lighter and the Costco (Michelin makes it for them) tire might be better. 
The name flees me at the moment. They are for a vehicle which is a tad bit 
lighter, 14 inchers. A couple of folks on the vanagon listserve swear by 
them. FYI- the Vanagon Westy is about 5200 lbs.

&gt;currently on the bus ('75 Westy) i have Cordovan Radials MSR 185/70R14 put
&gt;on by the PO.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;first...are these passenger car tires?  if not, what class are they?
&gt;second...what load range/class tire do i need since it is a bus AND a 
&gt;camper?
&gt;third...where is there a good place to order tires online? (reputatable and
&gt;CHEAP!)
