Subject: To guy who needs pic's of sliding door parts. 

I don't have your Email address with me, or I would PM you instead, but
I'm not mailing from home, so sorry list. 
 
I can't get those pictures of the guts of the slider for quite a while.
My workload's just doubled for this week, so I probably won't get home
to my bus for another week to take apart the door. 
 
Anyone else planning on taking apart a sliding door, that could take
pic's of it? 
 
Chris
