Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Swap Info?

Imagine that someone subscribed to a list of cat lovers and said, &quot;I am 
getting tired of my cat. I am going to train it to circle a spot three 
times before it drops for a nap. And I'm going to have its ears 
surgically lengthened. And what would you think if I strapped a digital 
playback device to its back so that the cat seems to say &quot;bow bow.&quot;

Interesting idea, I suppose, but why post an idea like this to a list 
of cat lovers?
