The problem is probably a classic one of the roller bearing splitting into 2 
pcs. ( this is what runs on the track slider )  You have to replace it...this 
is part #211 843 359b ... it can be found at www.busdepot_dot_com...unfortunately 
this little gizmo costs $45 ($10 more from other sources)..about the size of 
a quarter and 3 times as thick...oooorrrrr  find one used. But 95% of the 
time this is what's wrong if its the top slider mechanism....once you do get 
it fixed keep the mechanism and slider bar well lubed and clean...it's easy 
to let it go and opening the sliding door becomes more and more difficult 
then yougottofixitagain...oh, and don't forget the bottom slider and 
mechanism, that usually gets full of all kinds of crap to...
