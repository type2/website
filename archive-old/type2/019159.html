Steve:

It sounds like the drain isn't properly vented.

I've got two pipes sticking out through the floor of my Adventurewagen,
behind the driver's side door. One is the fill pipe for the tank (it's
aluminum) and the other is the drain pipe for the sink (black PVC). The
fill has a little plastic cap on it and a female collar (for a typical
garden hose). The drain has a male connection. Unless you've got a hose
attached to the drain to redirect it, it just gushes out on the ground
under the bus.

I think the simplest first task for flushing out your water system would
be to pop the sink back in, hook hoses up to the fill and drain pipes,
turn everything on and let just plain water run through. The tank will
fill up, the sink faucet will vent the tank (and allow the water to
course through the system) and the drain will get rinsed out -- you can
run the drain hose out to the gutter to prevent gushing onto the drive.
If you don't get water out of the drain hose, you've either got a clog
or your drain isn't properly vented. If you don't get water out of the
faucet you've got a whole 'nother problem entirely that I don't know
anything about.

I'd be VERY careful about what chemicals, if any, I put through that
system. Soap and water oughta be sufficient.

P.S. I had to replace the seal in the pressure cap. All I could find
that was big enough was a roughly conical toilet washer. I saved the
package for future reference (it's in my bus), so let me know if you
need the exact info. Also, my faucet leaked and had to have its washer
and o-ring replaced -- standard faucet parts.

&gt;  Hi ALL.
&gt; I just took apart the insides of BLUE and am having trouble with the sink. I
&gt; want to clean it out( the pipes and all) and am not sure how to go about
&gt; this. I have the sink itself off and am just left with that U shaped tube
&gt; sticking up. How do i puor water and other cleaning solutions thru there and
&gt; make them go the route they should instead of just overflowing? Is there
&gt; some sort of vacum  thing im just not getting? and where does the water go?
&gt; i have a tank right below the water resovior, when i unscrew the lid to it
&gt; there is another stopper. I dont wanna pop it open and have water from 73
&gt; and who knows what gush out all over the drive. Anypointing in the right
&gt; direction would be appreciated!!!
