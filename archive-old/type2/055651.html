It definitely improves drivability in cold weather, but doesn't do
much in warm.  I believe that the '70 had a cable that connected the
air control flaps with the air cleaner to redirect the air from the
hot hose to the snout.  When the flaps were closed, the hot air went
to the air cleaner.  I haven't seen one of these intact, so this is
speculation on my part.  My '71 had a thermostatic control that
redirected the air but I haven't seen one of these working either.

What I do is put the hot-air tube on in the winter and take it off for
warm weather.  I plug the hole with a 1-7/8 expanding freeze plug from
my local FLAPS (the rubber has to be trimmed a bit to fit) while the
hose is out.  The inoperative thermostat is disconnected and the flap
is wired in the &quot;hot air&quot; position.

A lot of cars have a simple &quot;on/off&quot; flap that you flip according to
the weather, so my jury-rig seems safe enough for the engine.

If the temps at your locale do not go below 50 or so you can get away
without the hot air hose.  If it goes lower you would be well advised
to keep the system working.
