Subject: parts for sale engine ,interior, ?

Well, I just bought a rebuilt engine from a local vw mechanic. To find out 
that I don't need it. So if anyone in the N. IL area needs a good rebuilt 
engine. Let me know I will let it go for $500.00 (long block only) Engine is 
a 1600 DP made into a 1684 I believe I can find out for sure. Nothing is 
wrong with it I just dont need it and I will be out to much money if I keep 
it around. It is a bug case with a bus rear hanger already installed on it 
since I planned on putting it in my bus.

I also have a green westy interior from a 76 bus. I will give it away if 
someone comes and gets it real soon. Comes with the top portion of the 
sink/stove, fridge, and bed. Is it worth alot more then i am asking. Which is 
you come and pick it up. 

I also have a 70 bus that i need to finish parting out. So if you need any 
parts let me know and i will get a price for you. Maybe just shipping cost 
depends on part. I would like you to come get the parts if at all possible 
though. But i will ship. 

I also have many other parts that i am willing to sell so just let me know 
what you need and i will see if i have it. Thanks
all parts are located in Belvidere, IL
