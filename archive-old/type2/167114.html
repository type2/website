Subject: RE: [T2] Backfiring, and popping,

Gonna sound wierd, but try a new muffler. If yours is pretty worn out it will
cause backfiring. On my 70 Bay I tried everything and after all was said and
done, a new muffler was the last thing I thought of to try and...... problem
fixed. At least in my case. Give it a shot. Good Luck!

10:04:06 -0600&gt; Subject: [T2] Backfiring, and popping, &gt; &gt; First off, I got an
awful lot of great help in pmails, and I know many of&gt; them came from this
list, when I first posted about my backfiring and&gt; popping from my 81 air
cooled.... I tried to reply to each one and say&gt; thanks, but I bet I missed a
few, so if those who helped, are reading this,&gt; thank you so very much for the
great help and words of support.&gt; &gt; Having gone over the vacuum lines, cap,
rotor, timing, compression and&gt; leakdown tests, I decided to adjust the AFM
and see what happens. Managed to&gt; ID it pretty well, for getting back to zero
if I had to, and then set it one&gt; tooth CCW to richen it up, and the symptoms
went away.&gt; &gt; Getting pretty good at moving the adjuster, I put it back to its
original&gt; spot, and the symptoms returned, so I split the difference as best
as I&gt; could, and no backfiring or popping..&gt; &gt; So, at first, nirvana, but
after thinking on it, I expect that I cured the&gt; symptom, but the problem
still exists, as I don't see why it would suddenly&gt; go lean and start popping
and backfiring.....&gt; &gt; So, I will revist everything, and even do a leak down,
while blocking the&gt; tailpipe, and getting up close to the heads to see if I
have a leak in the&gt; exhaust, etc.... I did the test, but not with an eye
towards an exhaust&gt; leak, so a redo is coming up.&gt; &gt; I just can't shake the
feeling that if I consider it fixed, I will regret&gt; it, in terms of
overheating, and risking valve seat issues.....&gt; &gt; Once again, my thanks to
all for the help so far.&gt; &gt; Have a good week.&gt; &gt; John&gt; &gt;
