Subject: [T2] 74westy and prayers

Hello list, my name is Todd and I own a 1974 Westy.I also have stage 4
Melanoma cancer and not much time left. I have been a subscriber to the list
on and off for 2 years now mostly in a selfish way.Taking all the great
ideas passed along and not much in the way of contributing. But I do want to
tell you all that since buying my Westy my family has sure enjoyed camping
in it.We got to spend alot of time camping last year before I got too sick
to continue. It helped bring us closer together, helped us meet new and
interesting people and make lots of new friends. I have enjoyed my Bus, I
enjoyed refurbishing the interior, putting new canvas on top,and generally
just working on it. And God willing I'll still get some use out of her
again.
