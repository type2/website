Subject: Re: [VB] 63-71 Euro tail-lights into US spec Bus

yes, you need to run a new wire.  The way I did it was run a wire for the 
brake lights and left the turn signals alone.   In front near the fuse box I 
unplugged the wire that ran from the MC brake switch from where it attached 
to the turn sig stuff, and ran it into a wire that went to the back.    If 
you get a 14.4 cable for your gauges (if you have some) the wires are all 
prewrapped in a casing

&lt;&lt; Hello to the Lists,
 I found some cool European rear lenses, bulb holders (dual bulbs in each) 
and seals so thought I would fit them into my 1970 Westfalia.
 
 I have read some of the archives regarding Euro (Red/Orange) tail lights 
being retrofitted into North American spec busses.  The article I paid 
attention to was the one from Matt Roberds.  I followed his instructions 
wiring the two running lights together then attached the turn signals and 
brake lights.  Now my problem is when I step on the brakes, my brake lights 
are now my flashers (orange lights).  How does one separate the turn 
signal/brake light wire?  Is this physically possible without running a new 
wire from somewhere?  Somebody must have performed this operation!
