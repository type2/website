Subject: correct dwell angle?

Hi, folks--

Maybe the moral here is that I have too many manuals.  But I notice that
different manuals don't always agree on dwell angle:

Muir says 	50 degrees +/- 2 degrees
Chilton says 	47 degrees +/- 3 degrees
Clymer says 	47 degrees +/- 3 degrees
Haynes says	47 degrees +/- 3 degrees
Bentley says 	47 degrees +/- 3 degrees for new points, 
		50 degrees +/- 8 degrees for used points

I've gone through the archives and library, and can't find any record of
this getting talked about.  I'm curious about the reason for the different
recommendations, but I'm more interested in knowing what numbers to rely
on [and why].  My dwell angle is 45 degrees right now.

I have a second question, too, from reading over a couple of threads on
the [sometimes imperfect] relation of dwell angle and point gap.  There
was some mention of having to fiddle with one number to get the other one
right--accepting a non-spec dwell angle if the points are by-god gapped
right, or going to a non-spec point gap to get the &quot;right&quot; dwell angle.  
If, as some listees said was the case, their rig just will not produce the
right dwell angle at the right gap, which measurement should they rely on?

thanks in advance
