&gt; There should be some way to test the integrity of the engine

&gt; But darned if I know how to do it!

light bulb test,  dark place at night, stick head as far into engine
compartement as you can.  have someone with bright flashlight shine light
all over outside of bus.  check rear engine comp door by sticking head in
thru rear hatch.

if the light can't get in air sure isn't, or at least not enough to
matter.   also remember WHERE the air is coming from is a major factor
too.  air from up near the tranny is a lot less of a problem than air
coming from near the muffler.
