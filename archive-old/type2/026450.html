Subject: RE:  Pulled my first VW engine yesterday
Date: Mon, 30 Nov 1998 10:53:00 -0600

&gt;I forgot to detach the accelerator cable and that made for a 
&gt;lot of head scratching, but it eventually came out.

Don't feel bad.  I forgot to detach both heater cables last time I
pulled the engine out of my 73.  Dropped it and yanked it out of there
and tore the ends off both cables.  Bummer.  But now I've got 2
brand-new, shiny, non-stretched cables in there :-).

&gt;Somewhere I got the idea that I can't do anything to clean up the 
&gt;stock oil cooler (it's a 2.0 L engine), inside or out. Have I got that 
&gt;right?

Pull it off and set it over a can with the holes facing down and the
whole thing tilted slightly towards the bottom (hole) end to let all the
oil drain out of it for a day or two.  Then spray Simple Green (or your
favorite degreaser) all over the outside and use a pressure sprayer at
the car wash or just you garden hose to remove all the grease, grime,
leaves, and shredded heater tube crap that is clogging the fins.  Then
carefully pour some gasoline into the holes, cover them with your
fingers, slosh it around a bunch (wear goggles if you tend towards
klutziness), and pour it out.  Repeat until the gasoline comes out
clean.  Others may feel differently about this, but it works for me.
