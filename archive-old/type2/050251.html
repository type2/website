Subject: Re: [T2] CV knocking

Hello Dallas,
I say drive it.  It won't do much, if any, harm to the transaxle.  It will
mainly just tear up the CV joint more...but that needs to be replaced
anyways...  Now I wouldn't take it on a cross country trek like that...but in
town should be alright.  I've driven other cars (not VWs!!) with awful CV
joints before...and they last a while...but just knock around a lot.  Take
your finals...be done with school.  I know I will be!!  4 more days of school
for me too!  wahoo!!  Then I'll be gradiated and much lerned.

Have a good four days,
Isaiah

&gt; Lately my right outer(I think) cv has been knocking loudly while driving,
&gt; happens mostly while decelerating. Is it harmful to the transaxle to drive
&gt; it like this? I got 4 days left till school is done before I have time to
&gt; fix it and I was kinda hoping I'd be able to make it to my final exams...
