Subject: vacuum leak from brake booster line

Hey all; 

I noticed today that I have a vacuum leak in my brake booster line - when
I turn the engine off and immediately go back to the engine compartment, I
can hear it hissing - it seems to be the old, frayed brake booster cable
hissing from near the junction of the black valve. 

The idle seems fine - perhaps it's not a big enough leak to lean out the
mixture too much - can this be patched, or do I need to install a whole
new brake booster hose? (looks like a pain). 

Thanks in advance - I'm hoping to leave soon on a trip! 

cheers
