Subject: [T2] '76 Westy wiring

Hello everyone,
This is my first contribution to the list.

I have a 1976 westy that was rescued from the mountains of North Carolina
where it sat for several years.  I originally purchased this bus for parts
but have fallen in love with the interior layout and nice plaid green
upholstery.  The interior seems to be complete except for the a/c breaker
box that is located under the rear bench seat.  I already have a 15 amp
breaker box that came out of a 1975 westy. It seems to fit perfectly but it
only has one wire feed (romex from outside input outlet.)  In the '76 there
are a second set of wires(blue,whit,red in a black jacket.)  Where do these
hook up?  Will this box work?  Is there some kind of power supply/charger
supposed to be there?  If not, where is the charger?
Any help will be much appreciated!
