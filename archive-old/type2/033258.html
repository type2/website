 I think AVP is basically an honest company trying to make a profit on
 volume by putting *some* quality practices into place.  &gt;&gt;


I agree completely on this point.  It seems that of the reputable type 4 
engine rebuilders,  AVP ranks right up near the top.  I would choose them in 
a heartbeat if I needed a type 4 longblock.

Maybe to start/rehash another thread here but has anyone had direct 
experience with Fast German Auto's type 4 longblocks?
