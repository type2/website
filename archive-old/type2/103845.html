Subject: Re: [T2] Re: ' 78 Westy Propane Tank, Free!

...Robb, I'd love to hear more on your conversion.  
Advantages? Pics? Is this a higher tank capacity than
stock?....

Conversion was simple in my case. The spare tire cabinet of my '78 Westy
lends itself not only to a convenient place to have mounted the BN-2, but
also adding a nice little nitch to rig a regulator and spin-on propane
cylinder set up. The conversion parts cost about 20.00 bucks total. Found
most of them at Walmart. As for capacity, well, no, the stock tank had more.
Problem was that finding a place to get it filled in the middle of nowhere
was a PITA. You can find the disposable cylinders in the middle of an active
war zone, and they are dirt cheap. I'm also one of those Baja Bus/Lets go
Mock the 4X4 types, and I had a problem with that stock tank hanging out
there in the open in front of god and everybody, just waiting for a rock.
After I tore the skid plate/regulator assy. off the last tank during an
&quot;excursion&quot;, I figured it was time for the switch over.
Robb
