&gt;Why do you say the Phillips head style screws are the worst?

Personal experience. Maybe it's because I'm Canadian and we use a superior screw back home. :-)

I don't know the whole history (let see if I get it right) but long ago a Canadian by the name of Robertson invented a fabulous screw with a square drive. Henry Ford's assembly was suffering under the agony of the slotted head screw and wanted to use the Robertson to save time on the assembly line in the order of a couple of hours. Robertson was a fool and refused to let Ford manufacture the screw under license so Ford made a deal with Phillips who invented his screw 28 year after Robertson and the rest is history, sadly.

&gt;I've worked
&gt;with both and generally prefer the Phillips head since you're not as likely
&gt;to &quot;cam out&quot; with your screwdriver if you come at the screw at something
&gt;other than a perfectly &quot;square&quot; angle.

That's due to the the screwdriver being a poor design. Unless your screw is also garbage if you have a driver with a parallel tip you don't have this problem. Don't get me started on cheap screwdrivers and counter sunk screws.
