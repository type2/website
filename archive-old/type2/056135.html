Subject: Help!  Terrible noise after adjusting my valves for the first tim
	e.

First off, thanks to everyone who offered advice on adjusting the valves in
my '77 Bus.  I finished the job, replaced the spark plugs (and the wires),
and thought I was done.  

Wrong! :-)

As soon as I started it, I heard a terrible knocking in the engine.  I've
let it run a few minutes (about 3 in all), and the noise has quited down to
a severe knock on the passenger side.  I opened up the valve covers, and
re-checked all the clearances, and they seem OK. 

Now, #1's exhaust valve &quot;sounds&quot; a bit funny when I work the rocker arm back
and forth when #1 is TDC.  It sounds like something is a bit loose inside.
And I couldn't swear it, but it seems like it's quite a bit more closed than
it's intake value mate.

Also, Exhause on #2 seems quite 'springy'.  That is, I can push the push-rod
in further if I apply more pressure, and it springs back.  

Someone on the list ask me if I had hydraulic valves.  I don't believe that
the '77 came with them... (can anyone confirm?).  BUT, the DPO just has a
local guy (kid?) rebuild the engine. (becuase she wanted it to go faster up
the hills to a 'dead concert :-)).  Anyway, how can I tell for sure if they
are hydraulic or not?

Also (not that I believe this matters, but in the interest of completeness)
I only change 3 plugs.  Mostly becuase I got tired of fishing them out from
under the tin heat shroud!!!  Any tips on getting them out easier?
(especially #2 and 4)

I'm pretty much stuck untill I hear some ideas about what to look for.  The
knocking seems to be in just cylinder, but I'm just guessing from the rhythm
it makes.

Thanks for everyones help!!!  I really don't want to take this to a
mechaninc, who will probably just re-adjust something and charge me $100.
