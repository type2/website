Subject: Re: warming up the engine ...

    Depends. I always take off right after starting in the bus. It's a 1500cc
1965. But I let the bug (1776cc, 1971) warm up otherwise it dies when the RPMs
are low. If you do warm up your car prior to driving, do not leave it outside
running while you are inside. If the RPMs drop before the engine is ready (it's
still too cold) and you are not there to keep them up, it will put stress on the
engine because it's not running fast enough to get the oil pumping to where it
should be.

My husband and I have had a running argument on this subject for years. He
thinks the '82 aircooled Vanagon should sit and &quot;warm up&quot; after being turned
on. I always turn it on and take off immediately, as suggested in the
handbook. (Since it's mine I win anyway. &lt;g&gt;) Any comments?
