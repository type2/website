&gt;I just want to make sure.

You might ask Bob Wallace (UK) as he has a Brazillian bus.

&gt;Also, only the chrome ones are available now, can I just have the body shop 
&gt;blast that and paint it white like the original?

They are both plastic I believe so they are delicate. On top of that, the white ones are $10-15 and the chrome ones go for $40 and up. Do you have a chrome one in new condition or a nasty used one?

The white one is VW part number 211 853 601E and they'll be back in stock someplace soon I'm sure.
