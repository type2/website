&lt;&lt; does anyone know where i can get a cheap flanging tool.  I am about to 
weld 
on a rear corner w/ a mig and hear that this saves a lot of work when it's 
time to put the mud to it.  I have had no luck finding one.  All I have 
found are expensive ones (around 100) that punch holes in the metal while 
flanging.  I'm looking for the vice-grip type.
thanx all

close enough for a drive-by ;-)
