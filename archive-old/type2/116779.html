Subject: FI Wire Harness Electrical Connector PN-Supplier?

My fuel injection wiring harness has a couple of damaged 2-contact 
electrical connectors-receptacles (the ones at the cold start valve and 
thermo-time switch).  The damage isn't too bad and the connectors should be 
OK for a good while, but I thought I'd replace them at a convenient 
opportunity.

Does any know the part number and supplier for the wire harness connectors?  
I noticed that the cold start valve receptacle was made by AMP, but I 
couldn't find a similar connector on the AMP_dot_com website.

By the way, I just replace the thermo-time switch on my '79 bus following 
the replacement tip on the Bartnik site.  Worked great...and very simple by 
first removing the dizzy.  You'll need a 24 mm socket too.  The whole 
replacement took less the 30 minutes, including replacing the dizzy and 
timing.  Following the Bentley manual, you'd have to remove the entire 
intake air dist system...a very big hassle.
