        I finally a VDO oil temp sensor to go with the guage in my dash that
I've been looking at for the past three years (just in time for that
dangerously hot central NY winter) and I'm wondering - Is there any good
reason why I shouldn't skip drilling a hole in my sump plate and just
install it in place of the drain plug?  It seems to be a good fit.  I'd
probably not bother to remove it each oil change - just loosen the acorn
nuts and drain the oil that way.  After all, I end up doing that to finish
the job anyway.

Thanks,
