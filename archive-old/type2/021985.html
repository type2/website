AFAIK type III coolers are the same as type 1 except for the oil pressure
sender hole.  (hmmm, this might be a good place for a temp sensor?)

Now, the type IV coolers are the same about the mounting surface and are
wider.  You need to mod the tin to use them, but it might be worth it.

&gt;WAIT, that is not true. There ARE 2 different types of type 3 coolers, I
know because I have one on my bus. There is one that looks exactly the same
as a type 1 except for the oil temp sender, BUT, there is also one that has
over 30% more cooling fins, that is the one I use. There is a bus here in
town with a NEW engine in it and he has recorded his temps at rpm's around
town and traveling. He is going to install a type 3 we the 30% more fins and
run it. This way we will know for sure if the extra fins make a difference.
