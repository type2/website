Subject: [T2] junkyard find and engine price

OK from the UK now...

I bought my &quot;needing rebuild&quot; engine for #120 and I had to drive to it, pull
it, and give the guy who sold it advice!

8 hours work
You don't wanna know what that would cost you in software/web development
time!

But I got an engine I have in my office that I can tinker and get to know
during the rebuild..
Priceless.
If you have no history, then assume the engine and trans are junk, and pay
junk prices UK for engine and trans at a yard ~ #150 - #200

Probably the same # for $ in the US because of lower inflation...

I went to GAP in Chicago and bought the same pair of jeans I was wearing for
the same $=# in 1999!!
They just didn't bother printing two labels for pricing until the euro came
in over here !
