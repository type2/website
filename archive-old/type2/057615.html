Subject: Re: Bus Crash (repost)

Well, rather than trying to find body panels, per se, I'd find a
junked bus with those areas in good shape, cut them out with a torch and
then cut out the damaged aread and MIG weld in the good metal. 
    Look in the vanagon list archives -- a guy there had done a whole
front quarter of his vanagon that way after an accident.
    As far as the insurance is concerned, just don't settle -- insist
that the bus is an antique (it is) and is a collector's item (true) and
that you are going to sue. Are you really sure you don't have neck pain?
Having headaches lately? 8-)
