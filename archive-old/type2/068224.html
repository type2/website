Yup Chip,

Sounds like the heat exchanger.  Two possibilities:

1) Take off the offender...clean the heck out of it, then repair
   any leaks with muffler repair stuff (I'd recommend the type
   that uses a fiberglass 'wrap'). All flaps have it.

2) Check out some graveyards, and yank a used one. 

In any case, you probably should clean them BOTH up and check the
flaps in each one. Bearing grease, etc.  Then check the cables so
they open properly.  Then 'ya got good heat ! A precaution would be
to get one of those cards (mentioned in previous posts) that measure
HC and CO in the interior.  Available from airplane supply places.
(They are cheap! 3-7 dollars)

Hope this helps,

&gt;Hiya all,
&gt;I thought I posted this over the weekend, but since I have yet to get a
&gt;response, I will re-post in hopes of a response. I have a '74 
&gt;bus. When I used the heat for the first time I was getting a faint
&gt;smell of exaust fumes. We took a small trip (~40 miles) and I was
&gt;only able to use the heater for a little bit due to the fumes.
&gt;
&gt;I have a new engine seal and decklid seal. Is there anyway to
&gt;test the heat exchangers to see if it is they that are the culprits?
&gt;
&gt;If it is one of the heat exchangers, and not the other, I am going to try
&gt;to route both hoses from my fresh air blower down the good side.
&gt;I realize that I will have even less heat, but new heat exchangers
&gt;are ~$350. OUCH!!! I could almost buy a Propex for that. So anyway,
&gt;I am looking for ideas and/or suggestions. Thanks.....
