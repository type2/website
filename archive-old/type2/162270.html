Subject: Help! Electical problems

Symptoms: I had the rough idle problem. Changed points and other
distributor stuff. Tach quit jumping wildly. Well, it started
doing it again. Last night I noticed the tach jumping around
was in line with my turn signal. Headlights seemed to be a little
dimmer than normal. This morning, car started ok. After driving
for a bit. I noticed if I turned my headlights on, it dragged my
idle way down. Turned car off, car would not restart, had to push
start.  Is this a bad battery connection possibly where the battery
is not being charged?  Voltage regulator?  Alternator?  I'm
kinda in a panic as this is my only vehicle right now. Any ideas?
