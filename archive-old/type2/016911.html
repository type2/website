Subject: Hooray!!! and Durnit!!

The good news:  I don't have to rebuild Maureen's 2.0L engine.  With
compression at 125 psi in #4, 132 in #1, the others at 130, she doesn't need
it.  Still need to figure out why she's got no power and why she misses
occasionally (probly has something to do with that single carburetor from a
Mustang...)  I'm still very new at this.

The bad news:  when removing the plugs I dropped #2 after getting it loose.
How do I get the d_at_## thing out?  I can't see it or feel it.  It's probly
laying in there atop a piece of tin, sniggering at my efforts.

#1 plug looks good.  #3 and 4 are black with soot.  Why a difference?  (I'll
check #2 as soon as I can retrieve it...)

This morning I opened the garage door to the fragrance of gasoline.  She
dripped gas all night (&quot;MaurEEN!  You peed everywhere!!  Badgirl!
Shame!!!).  Cracked fuel line just abaft the carburetor.  It wasn't her fault...

P'rfesser
72 bus, &quot;Maureen&quot;
