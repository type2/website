&gt; Has anyone ever dealt with &quot;Air Cooled Classics Porsche&quot; in

&gt; wondering if I should listen to him-- his is the only shop I've

Well you might ask around to some local porsche guys. If this guy does
good work on porsche engines (more refined &amp; pickier) then he would be
a good person for your VW engine.
