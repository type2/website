Subject: swing axle rear lowering kit
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

In a Wolfgang international ad in HotVW's I saw a swing axle rear lowering
kit that eliminates the gear boxes.  It is only $189,  Has anyone installed
one of these before?  It says that the
kit lowers the bus 3 1/2 in. which is too low for me but is it adjustable?
I e-mailed the company
but haven't had a response for a long time.
