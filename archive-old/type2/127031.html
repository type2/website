In answer to Richards reply:
 What is the stock total mechanical advance spec.
 for a 78 t4 engine(vacuum hose disconnected)?
 
 24.5 degrees at 3400 rpm. Bentley page 75 of
 Engine and Clutch.

Over 32 IS CORRECT.  If you add your 8 initial to the
24.5, that is 32.5. Why are you trying to fix
something that is in SPEC and not broke? 

If you have a STOCK engine, leave it as designed.
If you have a higher than stock compression ratio or a
radical cam, then the stock specs are worthless.
