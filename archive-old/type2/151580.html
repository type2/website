&gt;&gt;Check ALL of your vacuum hoses as in remove them and inspect them.  I
&gt;&gt;haven't done all mine yet, but I will remove them and blow through them
&gt;&gt;with the other end plugged to see if there is a leak. I just bought a
&gt;&gt;vacuum gauge too.
&gt;
&gt;What's the vacuum reading?

Finally got to check my vacuum reading. At startup, it was 16 and went to
15 as the engine warmed. If I rev the engine a bit, it stabilizes at 18.5.
Not sure what is normal.  I may still have a vacuum leak somewhere...
probably FI seals.
