&gt;
&gt;Can someone explain the different ratings?  In my manual for another car I
&gt;own, it specifies to use fuel w/ CLC 90, AKI 92, or RON 95 or 96 octane
&gt;rating.  At all our pumps (I live in So. Cal.) the yellow rating stickers
&gt;say the rating is derived from the (R+M)/2 method.
&gt;My question is - which of the above is this method?  Thanks.
&gt;

CLC is the USA method for figuring octane. 20 or so years ago there was a 
lot of 'false' advertising regarding octane rating. e.g. Sunoco blue 260 was 
said to be 101 or 102. They would pump up the research octane number (RON) 
by taking away from the motor octane number (MON). The government stepped in 
and said everyone had to add the RON and MON and divide by 2 to have an 
accurate rating. That's why the yellow label says R + M.
