Several possibilities here. Maybe, as you suggested,
the pilot bearing is dragging. Or the clutch disk
could be sticking on the input shaft splines. Another
possible cause, not likely I'll admit, is more exotic.
I remember VW issuing a bulletin addressing this exact
problem many years ago. Their solution was to drill
small holes in the center of all the rivets in the
clutch disc lining. It seems that a vacuum could form
and hold the disk to the friction surface.

'creep' forward just like an auto tranny will if &gt;you
let up on the brake. When this happens I shift to
&gt;neutral and the creeping stops,
