Subject: Re: [T2] Advice needed,


&gt;         One last thought, AAA offers a camping / campsite directory. The
&gt; directory lists the campsites, costs, and amenities. I really don't know
&gt; what it is called but if you contact a AAA Motor club office they can
&gt; help.

Yes they do but be very wary.....  I used my AAA directory Christmas of 2000 and had a gun
pulled on me at campground that was listed in there.  By the owner no less.  The story is in
the Archive.  But the short is...

DO NOT CAMP AT FOX FAMILY CAMPGROUNDS IN FANCY GAP, VA...Right off the Blue Ridge Parkway.
Sorry to yell but I want to emphasize this...

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
