Subject: Re: [T2] battery light + brake light - heater fan 


&gt; 1974 type4 dual solex
&gt; Symptom:
&gt; Battery and brake idiot lights both pop on
&gt; at the same time and stay on. Heat booster
&gt; fan doesnt work.
&gt; Belt is fine. System not charging.
&gt; 
&gt; Fix: Replaced voltage regulator. 
&gt; Sigh in relief, it wasnt the alternator.
&gt; 

I just had this exact same problem with my '74 westy, but the
alternator and brake lights would come on and go off erratically.
Turns out the power and ground wires to the electric fan had broken
off and were bumping into the engine tin. Fixed the wires and
all was well. Look for shorts and bad grounds.
