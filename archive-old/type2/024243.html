Subject: hella dual battery relay wiring 
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I've had a problem with my relay since I installed it several months ago, and 
was wondering if anyone could tell me exactly how theirs is wired.  Mine 
works for a while, and then the 15a fuse on the relay just blows.  I have to 
check the fuse every time I drive.  As of now, I believe I have fried the 
relay, or it is stuck open because the fuse isn't blowing, but the aux isn't 
charging either.  I followed the directions exactly, and even used the advice 
of Bob Wallace to ground it to the generator light, and it still blew 
seemingly randomly.  All I have connected to the aux fuse block is a stereo, 
lighter socket for a cd player, and interior lights.  I know alot of list 
members have installed these, and based on the archives, there haven't been 
any other people who have encountered this.  As always, any help at all is 
appreciated.  

Thanks
