Subject: RE: [T2] Poptop Wood Frame Repairs

I got all the pieces of the old frame off.  Closer inspection revealed the
following:

The rectangular frame (where the canvas is stapled) was actually made out of
plywood.  It actually looks to be made of the same stuff as the Westfalia
cabinets.

This frame is &quot;braced&quot; into place with smaller wedge shaped blocks which
were cut from solid wood.  Also, the points where the front hinges attach
were also made of solid wood.  I'm not sure what type of wood they were, but
they're not a particularly hard wood.  I could score it with my thumbnail. 

It's worth noting that on 'Rita it was the hinge connection points where the
worst rot was.  The plywood, (especially the cross bars at fore and aft) was
in remarkably good shape, probably because it's pretty sheltered from the
elements.  If they had all been completely varnished and the bus had a
proper poptop seal, I'd venture to say they probably wouldn't have had any
problem at all.

&gt;Stay away from the treated wood. Tis only pine.

Another concern about using treated pine is that it is usually lesser
quality wood and thus a very coarse grain with lots of knots, making it
prone to splitting, particularly when you drill holes through it.  Maybe if
you found a really good, clean piece it would work.

One possible good thing about using plywood is that although moisture
threatens the glue, temperature and humidity aren't going to warp it as much
and it'll be a bit stronger since the wood grains aren't all the same
direction.  Sealing the bolt holes would possibly resolve the problem of
direct moisture.
