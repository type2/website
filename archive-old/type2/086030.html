when I see this pic:

all I can think is:  &quot;THE RED ZONE IS FOR LOADING AND UNLOADING ONLY&quot;

&gt;
&gt;Here are the pics from Everybus 2002. Thanks to all who sent and are 
&gt;sending
&gt;pics. I will update the site regularly as pics come in so check back.
&gt;
&gt;http://www.72camper_dot_com/eb2002.htm
&gt;
&gt;I will be offering ALL the pics I receive from others, plus all of my pics
&gt;in full size (3 times larger than the full sized versions on the website)
&gt;for this year's Everybus and ALL of the pics from last year's Everybus on 
&gt;cd
&gt;soon. I couldn't put all of the pics on my site, but you can see them on 
&gt;the
&gt;cd. It will be a non-profit effort. Only charging for the cost of the cd 
&gt;and
&gt;shipping. E-mail me if you are interested. I will sell these at the 
&gt;campouts
&gt;too.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
