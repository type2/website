I don't blame you. It's a cool retrofit.

But keep this in mind: if you look at Blue Book values of vehicles of 
all types, or at asking prices, you'll see that higher end vehicles 
lose a greater percentage of their value faster than lower end 
vehicles. Why?

The answer is power windows. And power antennas, seat adjusters, mirror 
controls, anything with an electric motor and a switch. All of these 
luxuries fail long before the guts of an automobile do, turning a 
high-end vehicle (like the BMW these window motors come out of) into a 
broken toy that people don't want so much.

Switches, especially, are the most underengineered items in most 
vehicles.

One of the reasons that our buses are still on the road is because they 
have so, so few of these gizmos. Arguably one too few -- a windshield 
wiper pump would be nice. But pumps are available at any FLAPS.

If were going to do the retrofit (and I confess I am a little tempted), 
I'd be sure to get two sets of motors and two sets of switches. And I 
would be worried that two sets of each might not be enough.
