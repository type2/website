Subject: Re: Driveshaft removal or today's futile gesture

	Dave,
	By thoroughly cleaning the heads and tapping-in the key you've
done everything I know for certain. :( I had three stuck on our '70 and 
my beloved brother got 'em out with a thorough cleaning and a gentle tap, 
but they hadn't stripped. Completely. :)

	Are you sure you've extracted all the guck from the bottom of the
hex head pockets? Use a small flat-blades screwdriver or other sharp-
edges scraper to make sure its really clean down there. Use a bright
light to look into the hole and be sure.

	I trust you're using a 3/8&quot; drive allen key tool and a flex handle 
rather than a bent wire 'L' key  &amp; a pipe, yes? MUCH more torque available 
that way.

	A day for more pennetrating oil to soak down the threads never hurts-
and you can get at the threads from both sides on the tranny final drives-
the holes go through. Get a plastic tube over the spout of the pennetrating
oil, bend it and fish it to the end of the bolts and give 'em a good
spooge (that's a technical term). Remember that the bolts aren't threaded
into the CV, they're threaded into the final drive cone from the
tranny, so getting pennetrating oil down to the tip of the threads,
not up by the head, is the key.

	If you plan to replace the CVs anyway, you could try heating
the bolts, which will make them expand but might allow them to
break loose as they cool. 

	I tried Vice-grips unsuccessfully, but didn't damage anything with
'em, you might try that, possibly with a hex tool in the pocket so you
don't collapse it. 

	Your next choices all involve trashing the bolt, and possibly
the CV: 

	1) Braze or weld a big fat 13 or 15mm nut (possibly over some
hex key stock...) to the end of the bolt for more leverage. This
will really heat things up, which might break it free too.

	2) Saw the head off, at which point you'll still have to
get the tip of the threads out of the final drive cone but you can
screw a couple nuts onto it, heat it, vice-grip it, etc, etc, after
thoroughly soaking the actual threads with pennetrating oil...
You might be able to bend the remains at 90 degrees and use a pipe
as a cheater to remove it...

	3) Drill the head out- which at least allows you to use a powertool, 
and then follow option 2

	4) Drill into the head, as if for an Easy-out, using a left-handed
drill, which might apply enough torque to the threads to break the sucka
free.

	5) Actually try an easy-out. I'm most doubtful on this- the bolt isn't
big and just removing the head is going to be easier. If you couldn't
break the bolt free with the hex tool then the smaller flats of the
easy-out aren't going to improve things markedly.

	If you use any of these extreme measures, particularly heat, or heavy
impacts, you may affect the seals or bearings behind the final drive. All
I know for sure here is that I replaced our '70s seals once since I didn't
know how old they were and we were doing a drain and fill, and the tranny was
out of the truck anyway. If you really wallop the final drive cone I
have to believe that affects the bearing between it and the case, or
the differential spider. Which is why I favor cleaning, pennetrating oil,
sawing/drilling or heat.

	I hope this helps, keep us posted on what worked!

	Bill
