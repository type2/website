&gt; I did find a supplier of Mobil 1 synthetic transmission gear oil. Is
&gt; this stuff ok in my 75 bus tranny or does it do the same bad things as
&gt; dino GL5.

I use it !BUT!!! I have an auto tranny and it does not have the  GL4/GL5
problem to deal with at all anyway

Mobil 1 DEXTRON ATF in tranny
Valvoline 80/90 synthetic gear oil in final drive
