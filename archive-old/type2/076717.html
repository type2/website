Subject: Knock, knock

Whos'there? Not me, because my bus is broken...

'72 Westy, 1700, 009, Webber dbl bbl progressive. On
The way to my girlfriend's house yesterday, I started
to lose power and then heard a loud knockin noise. Drove it the 100 yards to her house and parked it.
Took a look at it today and found that the alternator
belt was loose, tightened up and turned the engine by
hand a few times to make sure nothing was binding. While
I was at it, I fixed an exhaust leak and adjusted the 
valves. All valves were ok with the exception of one,
which was loose by .002&quot; Checked the oil and it was
fine. SO thinking that the power loss was just the alt.,
I started her back up and immediately got a knocking
noise that faded away into silence. I've heard of this
before, so I cautiously crept up my girlfriend's long
driveway. Once I got into higher rpms, the engine was 
making the knocking noise. I put it in reverse and 
backed down the drive and parked it. It idles fine, with
no knocking. It knocks when revved up. Now, I didn't
run it for long, for fear of damaging something beyond
all hope of repair. Please help, as right now my bus is
my only means of transportation.
