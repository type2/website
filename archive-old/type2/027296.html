Hey Paul - I just did all that on my 71 westy. My bulb was actually fine, 
just the wires weren't connected. I'm not home were my bus and manuals are, 
but if I remember, there is a red wire form the bulb going to the brake 
light switches on the master cylinder.(goes to one, then a jumper to the 
other - both the center prong of the three prong), a brown wire going to 
ground (actually I think it grounds on the instrument panel) and a black 
wire also going to one of the brake switches. Axtually one of them may have 
gone to the emergency flasher switch. Oh well three wires going somewhere. 
If you don't have a wiring diagram check it out. I can help if need to learn 
how to read it (simple, yet a little confusing.)

You can access the bulb by taking the 4 screws out of the front of the 
instrument panel, reaching behind and unscrewing the speedometer, then 
gently pulling the panel. See if you have any wires there behind the little 
red light.

Hi Volks,
   Since we have owned our present bus, a 1971 westy, the little red brake
light on the dash hasn't worked.  It doesn't light when I push to test it
and it didn't come on when I had a recent brake preasure switch failure.  I
believe the bulb is bad as the rest of the wiring seems to check out OK.  My
question is, how do I get into that light fixture to replace the bulb?
   Thanks in advance, and have a great weekend!
