&lt;excellent year-by-year list deleted&gt;

&lt;and a bit of addendum for '71s&gt;

&gt; 1971  Dual port and disk brakes, so 1 yr only intake manifold with
booster 
&gt; port (although '71-74 autostick beetles &amp; ghias may have used the
same 
&gt; intake manifold).

This 1-year manifold isn't that much of a problem.  How often do you
wear out a manifold?  You can easily modify an ordinary dual-port
manifold if you need one.

Another 1-year part is the front engine tin with the doghouse cooler
hole.  The bus tin is larger than the late model bug tin, and in fact
looks like the bug tin with an additional flange welded on.

'71 and '72 also have unique brake disks and calipers.  They work
well, but tend to go through pads quickly.  '73-up calipers and disks
can be retrofitted if the late spindles are also used.

As far as 1-year only parts, the '71 really isn't too bad.  A lot of
the parts were 1-year only for the bus, but were used on other models.

&gt; More emisions equipment added. Aesthetically, went 
&gt; to the uglier big flares on the wheel wells.

Actually, just the rear.  The front flares came in later.  This is
also the last year for the curved (not angular) air scoops and
separate back-up lights.

  Also the small 5 lug 
&gt; wheels with the flatter hubcaps that don't use hubcap clips.

And, with the 5-lug wheels you get composite drums, so you can work on
the rear brakes without removing the &quot;big nut&quot;.
