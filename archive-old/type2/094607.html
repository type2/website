TJ,

Did you *not* look at the pictures(#12) here?????

http://www.shockwaverider_dot_com/78bustankjob/

I resisted doing this for more than 3 months.  I should have done it =20
first.&gt;&gt;
What did the Borg say? &quot;Resistance is futile!&quot; I know, I know...And the p=
icture does make one recoil in horror and run in fear...I have a mechanic=
 right now who is looking  (literally) into the tank, to see if it can av=
oid being pulled and such...It's handy, in a way, that I have that hole a=
bove it in the body that someone left...He is the mechanic, btw, that I b=
ought the Bus from, and he said he would do the work for free...However, =
he is hesitant (as I would be) to pull the tank...Oh, he can do it, and h=
as all the gear to do it...Just a pain. I can relate, but I am hoping he =
will &quot;see the light&quot; so to speak, and pull the tank. It would be worth it=
 to me to have it done right. However, and this is a faint hope on my par=
t, it may just be that when he looks in, the smeg and junk will be minima=
l and he can (carefully) vacuum it out. We'll see and I'll let you know. =20
BTW, how long did it take to do that to yours when you did it? =20
