If you unmount the shocks, you can really rock that sucker back and forth
and get a much better sloshing action and better purge of particulates. I
put a garden hose in the tank and fill it full, then unblock the drain and
slosh till it's empty. Three iterations or more if your still getting much
junk out. Keep going until you only get a few grains from a tankful.

After draining all the water you can, take a pre warmed up car. Hook a flex
tube to the exhaust pipe as it idles, or set the RPM at 2000 for faster
action. Put the other end of the hose on the filler pipe. Give it 10-20
minutes. It will be bone dry. That is also the way to dry a tank safe for
welding. We're talking bone dry.

&gt;fuel tank it would be ideal to flush and seal it now.  I didn't, so instead 
&gt;I flushed it in place using gallons of alcohol.
