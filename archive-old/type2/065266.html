Check Advance!!

20 degrees is way too much.  I had a vacuum distributor that wouldn't advance--the 
previous owner installed too long screws to hold on the vacuum can and jammed the 
advance unit.  It would only run enough to get out of its own way at about 20 BTDC.  
Yet liked to ping at lower rpms.  Go figure.

Anyway, check your advance unit by hooking up your convential timing light and run the 
engine thru rpm range and look for advance showing up on pulley.  If this appears to 
be working, you may have extreme end play at your crankshaft...affecting your timing.

If the advance unit is not working, your problem is obvious.  Repair or replace the 
advance hardware.

Footnote:  Many timing lights have dial in advance and retard.  These can be 
invaluable when checking the real advance range in your distributor.

20 BTDC is TOO much initial.
