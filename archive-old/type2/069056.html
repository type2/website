Subject: bus air cleaners

Hi all - while fooling with timing and carburation, I noticed that my motor
slowed WAY down when my stock oilbath cooler was reconnected. It did NOT
slow down as much as when we put a bug air cleaner or aftermarket jobby on
it. Now, how much is *too* much? I assume some is normal, but... my engine
likes to run very rich if the idle is to be happy - could this be a
contributing factor?  Can the stock bus can be succesfully cleaned out to
free up its lungs? Also, not having a stock muffler, I have no engine
preheat setup, nor the little thermostat doohickey. Where can these be
obtained, should I desire to add them in future? Should I just stick a bug
can on? Too many questions for a Saturday morn...........
  On the positive side: adjusted the float level in the carb (downwards)...
no longer suffer a gas attack when working on the engine at idle! Fooled
with the spigot a tad as well; there is a definite &quot;sweet spot&quot; to aim for
- - a certain place the jet of gas shoots down the carb throat that makes the
thing much happier. I would never have known this unless the difference was
pointed out to me by Klein and Lewis; I understand stochastic, venturi, etc
etc in a SCIENTIFIC way, but as far as I can tell, carbs are VOODOO.
