Subject: Re: [T2] What's the deal with all the cheap busses FS recently?

There's no such thing as a cheap bus. All buses end up costing about 
$4000 by the end of a year's time unless (a) you just want a bus in 
your driveway, and don't care about driving it; or (b) you're just the 
luckiest person around.
