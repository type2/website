I've had my Vanagon since '82 and am still not sure about those controls.
But I do have a setup that works for me. When it's cold I push the top lever
to the center (warm air on feet, my preference) or right (warm air on front
windshield). The second lever down goes to the right to turn on the
&quot;heater&quot;. The last two levers go to the left, opening whatever it opens all
the way. When I need to defog/defrost the windshield I turn on the fan, with
top heater lever to the right. (And I use a towel for quick defogging.) As
soon as the fog is gone I turn off the fan because I don't like it's noise.
And I drive with my window partly open, hoping that will somehow balance the
air and keep my windshield clearer. (I don't care much if there is real heat
inside the Vanagon.) I don't leave the Vanagon sitting to warm up after
starting it, feeling that whatever heat may come won't come until the
vehicle is in motion. Whether any of this is based in fact, I don't know,
but as long as my VW and I are Farfergnugening along on the same level,
all's well in our world.
