&gt;Karl von Salzen mentioned that he replaces his Temp sensor #2 every year
&gt;just as a matter of preventative maintenence.  Probably a smart thing.  I
&gt;personally would worry about stripping the threads on the head with this
&gt;much replacement so I'd recommend just testing the sensor regularly:
&gt;
&gt;         Put ohm meter contact between #13 and #17 ground.  This tests the
&gt;         Temperature sensor II.  At 68 degrees it should be between
&gt;2000-2900 ohms.
&gt;         (700-1000 _at_122 degrees; 200-400 _at_ 176 degrees; and less than 200 
&gt;at
&gt;         operating temp.)  Testing this at the Harness to ECU plug will 
&gt;test
&gt;         whether there is a problem in the harness too.


A little misunderstanding here. I don't change it once a year just to change 
it. I change it once a year because that seems to be it's lifespan! I didn't 
mean it was preventative maintenance. I said I consider it a maintemance 
item.

At first I thought it was a AFM problem. I would swap with another and all 
the problems would go away for a week. Then they would come back so I would 
put my original AFM back on. Problems gone again for a few days/week. 
Replace the #3 temp sensor and the problems were gone. I haven't been able 
to explain the one year life span. The one I have in now has lasted almost 2 
years so far. This one I put in dry after I cleaned the threads of 
anti-seize. I believe the anti-seize was insulating the threads and causing 
the sensor to read 'open'. This one also hasn't had the problem of loosening 
up on it's own once a month where I have to retighten it. Seemed like it was 
'check the oil, check the tightness'. Now it stays tight.

I still haven't found a decent 018 AFM, but I do have a good 020 if anyone 
wants it.
