                            NO MORE MICE!

my housemate Duncan told me, when i emerged this am, that Diana from the farm
had come over with tails of elcetrical woes with the 64 kombi,  smoke and
starter not shutting off.  no one was home there   so i

replaced the rear brake hoses this AM as they were clogged (65 camper)
 managed to bash my finger right well and have a lovely blister to show for
it.   had to be somewhere, so i cleaned up, got a phone call from a friend of
a friend who was driving from Eugene in his 

65 bus which cr*pped out just north of Chehalis and needed help.  I promised
to call back in the afternoon, as i needed to go, and got in the bug and
split

but only got a mile down the road before Bugster went on strike.  went to see
if a wire fell off, feeling late already, when i friend stopped and took me
home, leaving Bugster for the day :( 

  I jumped in the 54 kombi, which started right up. (glad i had renewed the
registration, which was lapsed. )  after a bit i became incredibly aware of
the lack of instruments in this archaic transport.   i tried to remember how
much gas there was.   I know some had been put in last weekend, probably on
the way to Seattle.     hmm, that's pretty far there and back,   but i cn
always flip it to reserve.   round the next curve the bus starts to sputter.
  i am completely dumfounded.  but hey, the handy pantry would be a better
place to coast to than perched on the shoulder to troubleshoot.   hey, and
why not put gas in too.   coast right to the pump and popped the engine lid.
  it was already on reserve!   Happy with gas,  i merrily drove away , and
wasn't very late :)

all before 11:30 am.

btw,   diana's ignition switch had fried, it is now hotwired and going to the
farmers market tomorrow,  and bugster decided to accept the current working
conditions, though i am afraid of further strikes, so offered him a fuel
filter as a present, which he gets tomorrow.     i thought this was a
collective, anyway.
