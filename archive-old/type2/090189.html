Subject: Re: [T2] alignment done, problems still

&gt; I went to an alignment shop after replacing my tie-rods.  I new the adjustment would be off because the old ones were off and I simply counted out the threads on the old adjustable tie-rod in order to help set the new one.
&gt;
&gt; The front toe was off by almost an inch pulling the wheels to the right.  The front camber was fine.  They told me because one tie-rod is non-adjustable my steering wheel is going to be rotated right a little and it is about 30 degrees.
&gt;
&gt; First question: can I take off the steering wheel, re-align it horizontally and re-seat it?
&gt;
&gt; Second question:  They measured the camber in the rear and it was -2 degrees instead of about -50.  They asked me about tire wear but I didn't notice any with my last set of tires.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, we went through the Bentley and the procedure was to reset the rear torsion bars which they do at their shop.  What should I do?

Richard
the steering wheel centers using the adjustments in the drag link. I
wouldnt trust the shop to do the torsion bars if they dont know this as
they really dont know busses very well.&gt;
