Subject: Re: [T2] Re:- Propane Tank - Retrofit


From: &quot;Michael Benthin (MUTS)&quot;
&gt; I checked the law and wonder if the following quote within it applies to
&gt; our horizontal cylinders obviously build befor 98......
&gt; &quot;The 2001 edition of NFPA 58 modified requirements to exempt horizontal
&gt; cylinders manufactured before October 1, 1998, from requiring OPDs. Also
&gt; exempt are cylinders used for industrial trucks, industrial welding and
&gt; cutting gases (these cylinders must be labeled with their use).&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt; The new law is shown here:

pane_cylinder_overfilling_p.asp

According to this site:
http://www.recvehicle_dot_com/propane.html
&quot;vertical non-stationary&quot; must be updated.
And the second paragraph says a lot.
&quot; The 1998 Liquefied Petroleum Gas Code section of National Fire Protection
Association (NFPA) Standard 58 called for the installation of OPDs on all 4 to
40 pound vertical DOT cylinders manufactured after September 1, 1998. The 2001
version of the same code states that horizontal cylinders are exempt from an
overfill protection device (OPD) retrofit as long as the cylinder was
manufactured prior to Oct. 1, 1998. That means that these cylinders can be
legally recertified after 12 years without making modifications. The tanks
mounted to motorhomes (designated as ASME tanks) are not subject to this
regulation. &quot;
