Subject: Re: [T2] STOP ! ! (please)

And modern cars from 70 mph are:

Acura MDX               205 ft          (all Acura's listed in this month's 
C&amp;D list over 167 ft.)
Buick's Aztec cousin    190 ft.

Most of the BMW's are about 165-170 ft.

Chevy Avalanche 210 ft.
Chrysler Minivan        216 ft.
Ferrari 360             175 ft.
Ford Focus              180 ft.
Honda Civic Hybrid      191 ft.
My CR-V                 192 ft.

None of the Jags do better, close but not better.
All but 3 of the M-B take more than 167 ft.

Mini Cooper             169 ft.
GMC Sierra Denali       224 ft.


Our old VW's do pretty good I think....

The improvement is in the repeated panic stops where heat fades the brakes. 
I had a couple of Mutsangs and a couple Beetles and all had 4 wheel drum 
brakes. ALL were scary after decending a mountain or in Naples, Italy 
(Beetles only) after several 70-75 mph panic stops. Naples has alot of very 
fast drivers with several curvy long tunnels where traffic runs 70 mph+ and 
often suddenly stops during heavy traffic congestion.

Sucks not to be able to stop cause your brakes are hot...


&gt;Lunch time reading:  Old magazine article says the 'new' 1971 VW bus, with 
&gt;the front disk brakes, can go from 60 MPH to full stop in just 167 feet.
&gt;Rate of stop is 23 ft/sec, with a G rate about .72.
&gt;
&gt;Now, 167 ft /  23 ft/sec is just over 7 seconds.
&gt;
&gt;Just how loudly could I scream for 7 seconds of panic stop, all 
&gt;(hopefully) four wheel pealing rubber, and the object of my attention 
&gt;drawing closer to my front wheels with every second??
&gt;
&gt;And this is a IMPROVEMENT over the 1970 ! ? ! ?
