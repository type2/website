Subject: Re: hi-lift_dot_com, replacement jacks to 25 inches!!

the high lift jacks are great!   im currently saving
up for one myself for my Jeep CJ.   anyone who goes
off road a lot will have one mounted to there vehicle.
  they are super heavy duty and can be used in a
variety of positions, even as a comealong.   see they
are multi functional i would imagine they would be
suitable for bus use as well.   any 4X4 shop in your
area should either have one in stock to look at or be
able to answer any questions.   last time i checked
they were about $50-70 bucks.   
just my $.02

&gt; Ok, I just found this, and maybe im missing why this
&gt; may not work, but this 
&gt; site, hi-lift_dot_com sells just that - higher jacks for
&gt; jeeps and farm 
&gt; equipment and whatnot. Although its not hydro... it
&gt; may be an option... 
&gt; anyone seen one in use?
&gt; 
&gt; sooo close to finishing my trip preperations, just
&gt; need to get all these 
&gt; little 'just in case' items, in hopes ill never have
&gt; to use them while out 
&gt; far far from home.
&gt;

&gt; &gt;Hi,
&gt; &gt;	I have a trolley jack I got from Machine Mart-
&gt; it's much better
&gt; &gt;built
&gt; &gt;than the cheapo pressed steel items that the FLAPS
&gt; carry but I don't carry
&gt; &gt;it in the bus because it's so damn heavy. I had to
&gt; exchange the first set
&gt; &gt;of axle stands that I got because they were too
&gt; short, so watch out for the
&gt; &gt;height on them, too!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  Just Kampers carry replacement Bilsteins, if
&gt; that's what's wanted. IMHO 
&gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt;stock jack is a pretty good compromise between size
&gt; and utility, given that
&gt; &gt;you want to carry it all the time but never use it!
&gt; They list them for £34.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Cheers,
&gt; &gt;	 W.
