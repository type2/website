&gt; Since the noise got worse under load, that is indicative of a wrist-pin or a
&gt; dropped valve seat. Glad you stopped when you did.

Well, he said it got worse w/ car speed, not RPM.  And also, the sound 
changed when turning one way or another.  If it were in-fact the engine 
that's having a problem, I'd venture to guess that it would make the 
sound at the same intensity whether turning right or left ;)

I'd look to see if there were any broken boots on the CVs as that would 
be a very good indicator of which joint might be failing if it is the CVs.
