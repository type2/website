Subject: RE: Quick heating question

Quick answer is YES, and YES...

72-74 boxes and system will fit the 78 body, I've done that on my 77
while I
mounted a two year search for all of the correct 78 bits for my new
engine
build..I'm down to needing just the cross over pipe to complete the
set...HELP!

The riser pipes connecting the exchanger to the flapper valve have been
NLA for
some time now, BUT...the risers on the 80 to 83 Vanagon are exactly the
same, and
that's what seems to be much more readily available these
days...flappers are
available as repops, but make sure you take the cheap paint off, and
finish them
in something more durable or they'll rust out very quickly...

If you're looking for good used, drop me a line off list, and I'll help
you out...

Have fun, and play safe out there everyone..

Hey, is anyone planning to go to Columbiana next weekend?

Den.

More questions...
 Too hot to think about winter, but I'd like to be able to use the bus
year
 round if I can.
 I've got the '72-74 heat exchangers on my 78, and I'm pricing out what
it
 would take to put heat in. I need control boxes, the tube from the
control box
 to the exhanger, and do I need those elbow tubes that go on the side?
I'm
 assuming I need to buy the '72-74 components to fit the heat
exchangers, but
 will they fit the body?

 Thanks
 Mat
