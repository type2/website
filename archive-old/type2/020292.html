Folks, let's not get paranoid about &quot;hitting&quot; the glass! I've seen at least 60
Bus windshields installed(10 were mine!) by pro installers, and to a man, they
all hit the glass, and not a light tap. I installed a junkyard glass myself, 5
weeks ago, used 1/4&quot; nylon shock cord, some Ivory liquid soap and 'new' mezcan
rubber and much profanity, and hitting it all the way around. No breaks, in just
as tight as a..... You can hit it with the flat of your hand, it isd designed to
take the stress of air pushing against it at 65 miles an hour, hail and ice
hitting it at said mph, and other such imprecations, without failing. If the
pros can do it, so can we if we take it easy.

My .021/2.

&gt;     I don't mean to disagree with you, and I'm certainly not here to put you
&gt; down, but I would never hit a windshield, or the seal with a hammer,
&gt; plywood, or my hand,  no matter how carefully or softly, a whack is a whack!
&gt;     I think you were very lucky not to have broken your glass. I'll bet it
&gt; wasn't cold in the shop where you were working.
