Subject: Re: [T2] amaaco in Portland OR

To make a long story short, the conclusion of latest discussions is
not to do it if you can avoid it, but if you must, they tend to care
for your car better and the paint will stick better if they see you
have gone to some TLC to prep your vehicle for paint yourself.

 Don't want to start another huge painting thread....because I know
 it's been done to death....but does anyone have an opinion one way or
 another about the Amaaco in Portland OR? Ever had work done there,
 etc.... I need to get my bus painted and I'm working on a budget, but
 I won't take it there if someone has a horror story.
