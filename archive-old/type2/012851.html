Subject: Brake hoses, lines, a WARNING
Mime-Version: 1.0

I want to take a minute to strongly urge EVERYONE out there to go
have a careful look at their brake hoses and lines this weekend.  Now
I do typically look at these things now and then, and have replaced
rubber lines on some of my bays before, but never have bothered to
on a Vanagon.

Well I bought the hoses for the '82 last spring at Manassas for a
whopping $8 each (nice Italian hoses FWIW) thinking yeah I'll do
em sometime, but hey it's only an '82 I mean I've had the new hoses
for the '77 sitting around for 5 years now and haven't gotten to em.
And the '82 only has about 83k miles, I mean WTF.

Well the pedal has been getting sort of soft in the '82 but I know
why, I mean the brake cables need replaced (have had them for a
year too) and I haven't adjusted the rears because of the cables and
all.  Plus its and automatic and they are always sort of soft, I mean
the '87 and '90 were the same, not as bad, but sort of....

So I've been getting some funny grinding up front, and well I sold the
Subaru today so yesterday I figured, have a look at the brakes, I sort
of suspected a caliper had been stuck and popped loose on one side
which rust on the front right rotor sort of confirmed, along with the fact
the other day I had got a good &quot;pop&quot; when I was braking hard.  Anyway
I'm down there and I see this funny looking spot on the hose as well
up near the crimp, and start feeling it, and it feels &quot;soft&quot; compared to
the rest, so I have a friend hit the brakes hard and WOW the spot
bulges out!!!  Now again, this is an '82 and 83k miles and a real straight
van, lots of people would never even think to look at em, but that is 19
years old volks.  The point being is I immediately replaced that one, and
voila rock hard pedal.  This weekend I'm going to do all the rest and flush
and fill, and do the '77 like I should have 4 years ago.  I mean this &quot;spot&quot;
was subtle too folks, just a funny textured spot maybe 1/8&quot; round, could
have been covered by dirt or undercoating EASY.  I don't really know why
it even caught my eye.

The point being just because your van looks perfect doesn't defy the
breakdown of 20 year old rubber hoses.  And something else Steve
and I discussed a while back, he was amazed how ratty his '67 steel
lines were when he replaced them.  A '68 bay is only one year off but
people just don't think to do bay steel lines.  And I know my '81 lines
looked worse than his '67 did.

This stuff is cheap, replace it, even if you arrogantly THINK you know
what shape stuff is in like me.  Everyone with anything older than an
'85 should order soft lines and replace them for sure ASAP if you don't
KNOW they have been replaced.  That guy at Manassas had all the bay
or Vanagon lines at $8 each, and I figure from Ron or whoever not more
than $12 or so.  JUST DO IT.

Long, sorry.
