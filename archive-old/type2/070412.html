It could be that I have a 6 volt pulley on the generator, and a 12
volt pulley on the crankshaft.  Would this be likely to cause such a
problem?  What are the sizes of the four pulleys involved?

please, please, there is no set '12V' or '6V' size pulleys.   there are
different size pulleys, but unrelated to voltage.

the 36hp style crank pulleys are largest.  i prefer the largest possible
crank pulley for my motor, but the 36hp style are flimsier, though not as bad
as the25hp ones.   ive found about 5 diff sizes of crank pulleys

i know of at least 4 styles of generator pulleys.   the earliers ones use a
different spindle.   another kind had two prongs that fit into notches, and
another has a oval with flat edges shape hole in the middle to keep it in
place.   sizes also may vary, though not as much as with the crank pulleys.
