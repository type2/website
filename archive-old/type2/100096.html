Subject: Re: [T2] Transmission output shaft bearings loose... Help

&gt; Ok here goes, My CV boot on one side ripped, I patched
&gt; it with innertube material afer packing it with tons
&gt; of greas and set out on my latest mini road trip from
&gt; Kentucky to South Carolina. In North Carolina I
&gt; stopped to check the wannabe CV boot and noticed that
&gt; not only was my repair broken, it was still holding in
&gt; some grease but definatly not a longterm solution.

When the boot rips, it's done for. It flexes quite a bit as the half shaft
rotates and when the rubber gets old cracks form easily.  Make one part
stronger, if you can, and the other end will surely rip.

The grease really has to be pressed in the joint itself.  When the
instructions say pack the extra grease into the boot I can only assume if
means &quot;on&quot; the joint in the boot end.  I can't see what good the grease will
do just sitting inside the boot as it gets flung to the inner surface as it
rotates.

&gt; Worse was my next discovery that inboard of the CV
&gt; where the axel enters the transmission case, (sorry
&gt; for the lack of technical terms) the bearing there
&gt; appears to be loos and is moving up and down _at_ 1/8 of
&gt; an inch. First of all I'm assuming this is not normal.

You mean the flange? This should not have any travel in it but I don't know
how bad 1/8&quot; movement is.  Normally bad for any kind of bearing.
