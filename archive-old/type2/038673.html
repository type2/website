Subject: Re: Mirror and antenna

If memory serves, when I replaced the broken antenna on our 82 Westy the
only access was from one of two places.  For the life of me I can't tell you
which one right now but I'll check later.  It's either from beneath the
front end of the van looking up from ground level, or it was after removing
the grill and accessing the space from behind the headlight.  I think it was
the first, but I'll double check for you later.  All this assumes that your
antenna is mounted in front of the windshield on the drivers side of the van
like mine.  Otherwise all bets are off!

Hope this helps!
