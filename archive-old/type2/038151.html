Think you might mean &quot;Grants Pass&quot; -

STRICTLY FOREIGN
405 UNION AVE
GRANTS PASS OR 97527
(541) 476-1999

My mom was in transit from Seattle to LA in her '71 Bus just outside of
Grants Pass when the motor decided to seize - due to an improper valve
adjustment before the trip.  Strictly Foreign got her back on the road in 2
days with a totally rebuilt engine.  The shop that did the valve adjustment
picked up the tab - without asking - Buttera Motors in Bothell, WA.

BUTTERA MOTORS
14235 100TH AVE NE
BOTHELL WA 98011
(425) 821-1222

&gt; Hey all,
&gt;
&gt; In the shopping mode for a rebuilt engine, my mechanic has used and
&gt; suggested Strictly Foreign in Grants Bend, Oregon.  Any one know of them
&gt; or have good or bad experiences?  I am also considering Mark Stephens,
&gt; based on the feedback I have seen on the list.  Someone had recently
&gt; posted about a guy he used on Long Island which he was very pleased
&gt; with.  Does anyone have that info?  It is not in the archives yet.  Any
&gt; one want to suggest another to consider?  I am on the East Coast in New
&gt; Hampshire.
