&gt; 1-2-3-4 order. The way of Saint Muir is the answer!

Now my mechanic told me that at TDC I can adjust:
   #1 exhaust and intake
   #2 intake
   #4 exhaust

then turn the engine 360 degrees counterclockwise (rotor turns 180 degrees) and adjust
  #2 exhaust
  #3 intake and exhaust
  #4 intake

Is this a true?  Is it a good idea?
