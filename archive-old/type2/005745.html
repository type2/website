My parking brakes seize up after driving in heavy rain, so I took Doktor
Tim's advice and took a look inside the rear drums of my '71 Westy. Lots of
rust.  The cables were ok, but the shoes and hardware had a thick coating of
grunge/rust.  Wire brushed everything, put on new shoes and drums, sparingly
lubed the parking brake hardware and adjusting stars with high-temp disc
brake lube (so it wouldn't melt and get on the linings) and adjusted the
shoes and parking brake.  I think this should get me through a few
rainstorms, but I am looking for the rubber plugs for the adjusting and
inspection holes on the backing plate. Anyone know a source?  By the way,
the rear brakes had never been adjusted, and though the linings were ok, the
wear was very uneven, resulting in less than half the shoe contacting the
drum.  I am a believer in regular shoe adjustment, now.
    On another note, I replaced the front brake hoses because the brakes
were pulling to the left. They were almost completely plugged. No more pull.

&gt;
&gt;&gt;My question is.. is this a normal occurrence in wet weather? Or do I have
a
&gt;&gt;big problem to worry about?  I had the brakes done about 4000 miles ago..
so
&gt;&gt;I would assume they are in good shape.
&gt;
&gt;Assumptions can kill you, Nick. Pull the drums and look things over to be
&gt;sure. I've seen too many DIY brake jobs, and more than a few from
&gt;idependant shops that, get things backwards, springs not oriented right and
&gt;even loose hardware rolling around.
