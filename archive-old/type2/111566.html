&gt; Just found the list.. looks like a good source of information.

yes, it is. stick around

&gt; Background: I have a 78 bus w/ 1700cc fi motor.

Double check that, a stock 78 should have a 2000cc, but anything is
possible after time.

&gt; Question: I am trying to install a battery isolator in the unit. I have one 
&gt; (90amp) and a deep cycle battery I am going to use. However I simply cannot 
&gt; find the regulator in the engine compartment to hook it up to.  The crappy 
&gt; haynes manual is no help.  I have been told it should be mounted at the 
&gt; back on the firewall. A silver little box with 3 wires into it. I can't 
&gt; find it.

Look in the picture here:

You see the small silver thing on the firewall with wires coming out
of the bottom? that is the regulator, if that is what you are looking
for.
