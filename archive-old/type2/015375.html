&gt;I've read instructions on getting glass into the windows of a van (1/4'
&gt;rope, 2 people etc) but don't recall reading how you get a window OUT in one
&gt;piece.
&gt;

Cut the seal.

 It is a quality item (proper VW part from Brazil) with a nice
&gt;catch and a good aluminium frame. The man on the phone said it used the
&gt;standard window rubber and since mine are less than a year old they should
&gt;be all right. 

Must cut seal to remove existing PAIN. Cost of new seal solves issue.

&gt;Can anyone suggest a method  of removing the old glass ?

Cut the seal, heartless as it may seem. It was probably a low bucks TUV
Brazil approved item anyway. They got buckets o' latex fo-yo-mama.

Either that, or sacrifice the existing PAIN you won't need and break it out
to reclaim the seal to install the new window. Cover one surface with tape.
Use face protection. Scratch perimeter and diagonals with a glass cutter.
Rap it with a ball pean. Gloves certainly. Vacuum handy for shards minute.
Lay down newspapers for quick capture and disposal.    

Or, let the list know you will trade a Genuine German TUV approved PANE to
anyone who will send you a new seal. 

The jack sounds like it suits your basic tire changing duties to a tee. I
believe that's what it was designed to do. Even a 1 foot square piece of
3/4&quot; plywood greatly improves poor foundations for stationary jacks. A drop
of oil on all the piviots of a scissor jack from time to time will extend
life of the pins indefinatly. Makes for lower effort lifting as well. Spray
grease by LubroMoly is excellent for this and many applications, hinges and
such.
