&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) No Reverse. If I am not mistaken the reverse is down and all the way
&gt; &gt; &gt; left. At least that's what the sticker on the ashtray says. I cannot seem to
&gt; &gt; &gt; get her in reverse. Any Ideas?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You have to push down on the shifter when going into reverse. Try pushing
&gt; &gt; down while shifting down and to the left.
&gt; 
&gt; Well,
&gt; 
&gt; Actually, it's a three-step process.  Push down first (toward the ground),
&gt; then move the lever all the way to the left (toward the driver (in North
&gt; America [1])) then toward the front[2] of the bus.  It's position is
&gt; rather like first gear, but more to the left.

&gt; [1] In Britain (and other RHD countries) is the trans the same or is it
&gt; reversed with the steering wheel?
&gt; 
&gt; [2] back in a Vanagon, and it is like second, but left.
