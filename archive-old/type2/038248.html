&gt; &gt; The engine never ran bad. It just has this annoying little miss that I

&gt; Ooooh! I just found GEX on the web and was looking at their engines. I am
&gt; considering a new or rebuilt 2.0l air cooled for my 81 Vanagon.
&gt; 
&gt; Judging by this comment :) there might be some opinions around here
&gt; concerning Gex. I would love to hear about them. This is the first time I
&gt; have seen them mentioned on the list.

You probably have a snootful of responses by now, but...

I bought a stock 1600DP rebuild several years back from GEX for our bug 
and had the following problems, in chronological order:

1. They were offering a free Bentley manual with each engine.  They were
out of them.  They said that they would send one when they came in.
Apparently they never came in, since I am still waiting.

2. Ordered engine with (and paid for) new heads.  The heads installed
featured wildly random valve heights.  Obviously not new.  Should have
taken it back at that
time, but wife needed her car running.

3. I took core in to GEX on the same day I picked up rebuilt engine.  It
took several weeks and phone calls to get the core charge back from them.
the last time I called they said &quot;the check went out in the mail
yesterday&quot;.  The check arrived with a postmark two days after the day I
called.  Must have slow mail there.

4. Engine had borderline oil pressure from day one.  Oil light would come
on when returning to idle after a summer highway run, even
with 20W50.  Sign of a loose bottom end.

5. Engine lasted less than 40K miles (in a bug) before suffering what I
think is burnt valves in #3 and #4.  Would only idle on two cylinders.

I've said it before and I'll say it again:  If GEX was the only VW engine
supplier on earth, I'd buy a C*evy!

Check out Boston Engine, or Mark Stephens for your rebuilt type 4.

They aren't perfect, but at least you have a fighting chance of getting a
good engine from them.
