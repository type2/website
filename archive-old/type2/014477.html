I finally got my runner cover off, thanks to all the tips from many
listmembers.  I had to soak it in WD-40, and use a block and 3 lb.
sledge instead of a rubber mallet.  I was beginning to think it had been
welded to the bus. 

I just wanted to say thanks for all the tips.  I also subscribe to the
Volvo List (Swedish Bricks), since my wife drives a 1984 240 DL.  I'm
lucky to get any replies from posting to that list.  It seems VW bus
people really go out of their way to help a fellow busser.

Thanks,
