&gt;I placed an order with them a week ago &amp; all was well, however they have not
&gt;sent out the magazines as far as I know. You can win the first issue on the
&gt;events page competition (see 3 days ago).

Got my copy yesterday.  It looks like a good magazine.  There's a '64
single cab and a '61 Westy featured, both in mint condition, and even a
feature on Jan Willem Brier's web site.  The double cab syncro is pretty
awesome as well.  Pity it's only issued quarterly.
