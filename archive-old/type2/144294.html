The &quot;lube&quot; is an anti-squeak measure, meant to go on the _back_ of the
brake pads (between the pad and the sheet metal piston positioner plate)

I've used the stuff on occasion, but I've also omitted it without
having the brakes squeak.  You won't hurt a thing by omitting it if it
concerns you.
