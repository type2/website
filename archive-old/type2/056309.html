Thanks for all the great ideas!

My bus runs great again.  I did a cursory check of the ignition.  I keep it
tuned so didn't expect the problem to be there.  It wasn't.

According to Bentley, FI is rarely the cause for engine misfire.  Therefore,
it didn't tell what to check if an engine's misfiring.  I went to Probst's
Bosch Fuel Injection book for that.

He suggests checking: throttle switch (ain't got one), injectors, leaks
(doesn't specify fuel or vacuum), air-flow meter, and fuel pressure.

First, I checked temp sensor II since two listees said it caused similar
symptoms in similar vehicles.  Tough to check if sensor isn't 68 degrees F.
Ambient temp was 105.  Dripped water on it enough to see resistance increase.
Not the problem.

Got around to checking the air-flow meter (aka intake air sensor).  Probst
gave terminal numbers that didn't jive with my sensor.  Bentley gave
appropriate terminal numbers.  Checked resistance between 6 and 9.  300 ohms,
ok.  Checked between 7 and 8.  Bentley says 80 to 200 is OK.  MIne read about
10,000.

According to Bentley sensor's thrashed.  Probst's procedures weren't
conclusive.  
Bentley was right.  A rebuilt meter/sensor made my bus run very sweet.  

Conclusion:  There's a market for a complete SHOP MANUAL for 68-79 buses.
Bentley is not a shop manual.  I've owned one for a long time, and there's a
hell of a lot I don't know about VW buses.  Probst probably knows about
everything there is to know about Bosch fuel injection.  Problem with his book
is that it's like a Chilton in that it covers every Bosch fuel injection ever
made.  That provides a hell of a lot of info I don't need, and lacks some I
do.

Enough bitchin.  Thanks to everyone who submitted a suggestion.  I've learned
more about how my bus operates in the few months I've been on the list than in
the previous ten years of bus ownership.

On the road again,
