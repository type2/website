Hello from the 221,000 mi Westy with never rebuilt engine-- and Yes, I
have all the original FI stuff on it, even the fuel pump.!   Much more
reliable than the fun I had with a 34 PICT3 carb and a Holly-Weber carb
on a 71 bus.  Only problems I ever had were due to some hose sucking air
after the AFM (when it's intermittant, can be frustrating- and that one
turned out to be that little black y connector buried near that black
breather box.  It doesn't have a lot of bite and any end crack can make
it leak.  Which makes me wonder- could one use the smoke stick radon
mitigators use to look for air flow in cracks in your cellar slab?  You
could see where smoke was being sucked in.

&gt; Fuel Injection-It's nothing to be afraid of!  I bought my old '76 Westy
&gt; mainly because the FI had been removed and it had a single Weber carb. After
&gt; reading so many horror stories about FI, I wanted no part of it. Well, the
&gt; Weber presented it's own nightmares, which I never fully sorted out. My '77
&gt; has the FI, and for the past two weeks I've been tearing everything apart,
&gt; replacing fuel lines, injector seals, cleaning electrical connections,
&gt; replacing the manifold boots, and it now runs very nicely. Thanks in large
&gt; part to Sean Bartnik's FI info, and Bentley's, I now believe I understand the
&gt; function of each part, and how the system works. It's no longer some dark
&gt; mysterious force. The '77 barely ran when I bought it, and replacing all the
&gt; vacuum lines/seals/etc. has made a very big difference. Some of you may
&gt; remember a while back I had dropped my spark plug socket under the tin by #1
&gt; cylinder, had a hell of a time getting it out. One tool I bought after that
&gt; was a flexible neck light with a magnetic pick up on the end. I don't know
&gt; how I made it so long without this thing-it's great for looking into the dark
&gt; recesses of the T-4 engine. It was only $7.00, money well spent. I finally
&gt; got tags for the Westy this week, finally gonna get to drive it this weekend.
&gt;  The axle beam replacement is done, and while I can't say it was fun, this
&gt; too was a valuable learning experience, and again, thanks to listmembers who
&gt; posted details of the job. I've delved further into this vehicle than any
&gt; I've ever owned before, but I now feel more comfortable with it. BTW, the
&gt; fuel lines were close to disaster, I know it's said  a lot here, but if you
&gt; haven't looked at yours in a while, do it now! Can't wait for Everybus 2001!
