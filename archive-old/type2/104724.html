Subject: RE: [T2] side marker lens

&gt; When you find a good brand - please share. 


This is one of those products where you'll get the same brand no matter
where you buy it. While Hellas (albeit perhaps Mexican ones) were
available for a while (at a much higher price), it's been years since
I've seen them.  (There was little worldwide demand for them, as busses
built for most other countries never had side marker lenses in the first
place.)  So, for the last number of years, the repros are all that have
been available, anywhere.  That said, I really haven't had any other
complaints about them.  Truth is, as far as cheap repro's go, I've seen
much, much worse!
