Looked at a 79 Westy today.  Guy wants $500 for it.  Engine is out and
disassembled with a burned out #3 piston and all that entails.
Converted from FI to dual Delorto's.  Canvas has some bits of dry rot
and needs replacing, as does most all the rubber.  Tranny sounds as if
it was strong up until the engine blew.  Like wise with front end.
Interior reflects some of the previous owners personalites.  Sheet metal
screws holding down peeling veneer from the cabinetry around the sink,
stove and fridge.  Original upholstery in pretty good shape.  Not much
rust to speak of other than some minor surface rust in the usual places.

 

Thoughts anyone?  What else should I look at/think about?  Looking at
around $2,000 just to put it on the road again.


Thanks in advance,


Duke
