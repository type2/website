Subject: RE: [T2] Wind Shield - Window Removal

&gt; P. S.: Windshield seals are cheap, about $20 for the &quot;California&quot;
&gt; one-piece style. (We Californians get blamed for everything.)


On my site we call it a &quot;Euro look&quot; seal rather than &quot;Cal look,&quot; which is
more accurate.  This style of seal (which does not accept a &quot;chrome&quot; molding
strip) was the norm on Busses sold in Europe and most of the rest of the
world ... EXCEPT California and the rest of North America. We here in the
States got the fancy seals with the chrome molding trim instead, on many
models.  I guess Volkswagen decided that Americans liked their chrome. :-)

Economies of scale dictate that the seals that don't use that trim are much
cheaper for like quality, since those that do are somewhat of a niche
product primarily for the U.S. market.  I sell a &quot;Euro look&quot; genuine VW
replacement for $24.95, or an aftermarket one for $14.95. (The genuine one's
worth the difference.)  By comparison, all of the ones that do accept a
chrome strip are all aftermarket, yet pricier. (And that doesn't even factor
in the cost of the &quot;chrome&quot; molding to go with them, which is made of
plastic these days and quickly begins to yellow.)  Therefore, Euro look
(excuse me - Cal look :-) is the way to go, unless you really like your
chrome.
