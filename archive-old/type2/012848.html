&gt;Anyone got a line on a hitch such as Rick describes? Can anyone fab 
&gt;these for us?
&gt;I haven't seen any hitches meeting Rick's description in about 3 months 
&gt;of looking...




I own 2 styles featuring a full crossmember.  The first we bought new
from JC Whitney in the day (the day being '77 or so to put on the '76.)
It is actually an adjustable unit featuring 2 U channels that slipped in
each other and crossed between the 2 locations where the engine bar
mounted using adapters up to those mounts.  Funny thing is it didn't
fit new in '77 and required home fab adapters.  Still it was a better hitch.
The second I got off a '75 parts bus and is a gorgeous design, I'll take
pics this weekend, it wouldn't be hard to fab.  It bolts I think (I don't
recall and have never mounted it) between either those same points or
maybe to the bumper mounts (this seems more likely) and is much
HD in general.  I'll email Steve some pics and dimensions and get em
posted on T2.  It is just a piece of 2&quot; angle iron and 2 bent steel end
pieces really.  Wouldn't be $50 for a good weld shop to make, hell it
may be home made but does look commercial in execution.  The Whitless
one had a plate that bolted to the bumper for the tongue which I never
liked (drilling holes in my nice bumper) the HD one is totally self
contained.
