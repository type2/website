&gt;Engine longevity may suffer from carbs washing the

That is a feature of chokes, which the Dells do not have.  

&gt; Increased fuel consumption

If they are jetted properly, the difference in mpg is very slight.

&gt;higher power output, placing humans at risk of a crash!
&gt;G forces, whiplash, blinding speed, mistaken for a UFO !
