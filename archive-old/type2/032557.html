Subject: RE: Make your bus tax deductible (fairly long)

Jan and All...

Reminds me of a friend that had an early '70s Mercedes SL Coupe as his 
&quot;company car&quot; (he's a self-employed architect).  

To optimize the situation, he somehow managed to license and register it as a 
&quot;truck&quot;.  Complete with load weight signs on the sides (tastefully done in 
gold lettering).  This allowed him to legally park in loading zones for 
extended periods as he traveled about town.

Drove the meter maids nuts...  but he had all the right documentation.

OBC:  Has anyone recently registered their bus as a &quot;company vehicle&quot;?  How 
about as a truck?  Seems as if there would be insurance advantages, as well as 
tax advantages.....
