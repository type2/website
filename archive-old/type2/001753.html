Background - 1972, with '78 engine.  I just recently got rid of the Weber
Progressive and installed FI Form an '83.

The Van ran better than it ever had, but if let it idle for 5 minutes or so
it would die.

I was getting vapor lock the warm gas kept on being recirculated until it
became hot gas.  A '72 does not have a return line going back to the tank. I
had installed a 'T' before the fuel pump.  It seemed like a good idea at the
time, the gas had to go somewhere.  I was not getting vapor lock at speed
because I was consuming the gas, not allowing it to reheat multiple times.


My solution --

Bring another line into my tank.  I already had an access panel cut in above
my fuel sender from when that was replaced.

I installed a tap right next to my sender -- If I had a '73 or later I think
it would be possible to make the tap in the sender, so would not have to cut
a hole in your tank.

I ran the line through the round black access panel in the engine
compartment to the new tap .
If you want more info contact me.


Any how it works.  Thanks to everyone who helped, especially Harmon for
thinking of vapor lock,  - It was quite obvious after he suggested it.
