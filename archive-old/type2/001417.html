Subject: What's a CR Pinion Seal?
Date: Thu, 22 Mar 2001 10:10:59 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I recently purchased, what I believed to be a replacement rear seal for my
transaxle, and the item that was delivered, was a CR pinion seal. Is this an
alias for the rear seal or to I now have a brand new seal that goes
somewhere on some engine I've never seen. the seal is supposed to be for my
'77 kombi station wagen
-Thanks
