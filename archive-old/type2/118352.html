Subject: Van will start...20 seconds later it dies by itself?????

Dear Type2,

I am troubleshooting a strange problem.

I have a 1979 2000cc FI Transporter.  I have done a lot of work on it and
bought many new parts.  The engine has been running well except for the
following scenario.

She starts.  I step on the accelerator to let her warm up and then the
engine dies on its own from 2000 rpm to 0 in 5 secs.  Eventually the engine
will start again and run fine until unpredictably the problems occurs again.

I have no reason to suspect anything because once she is warm and moving she
runs great.

Has anyone ever experienced these symptoms(sp?) before?

Thanks,

Chris Walker
