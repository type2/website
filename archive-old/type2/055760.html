OK, Sean, you definitley have a point. A good point. A real good point. Here is more ASTM stuff - The RON affects low to medium speed knock and engine run-on or dieseling.  The MON affects high speed and part throttle knock, during periods of power acceleration or hill-climbing. After this it says- The performance of a fuel, in some vehicles, may be best represented by the RON. and in others the MON. Extensive studies indicate that, on balance, gasoline AKI  performance is best related to the average of the two. There, now tell me more about the CLC method, please. I want to learn as much as I can. Thank you. Jim Duncan OUT
