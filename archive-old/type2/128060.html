Subject: [T2]setting mixture for dual solex 34mm

can someone tell me the correct setting for the 34mm solex duals?
i just got them and put them on and to find out that the company DOES 
NOT PRE SET the carbs and that they are suppose to be set 2 1/2 turns 
from closed... 
so is there not a rpm50 drop after they are warmed or anything just i 
just leave them at 2 1/2 turns out and then begin to adjust the flow of 
each carb without linkage on?
After i have them set as far as balanced to same pull, i then make sure 
that the linkage when attached doesnt rev them up any and is set 
correctly?
 
Some one please help me here that has set up duals before please...
I was missing the Fuel T from the package as well as the lack of 
instructions////
there was the usual about performance and such and telling that there 
was a right carb  and left and how to determine but never did it say 
anything about setting the mixture as i would of expected...?
 
thanks for all and any help.... i cant go any further in the bus....
we thought it was set right until i drove home yesterday and trying to 
start off from red lights was terrible... foot all the way to the 
floor... i knew they couldnt be right then...
at top end though they did fine and cruised along...
peace
