&gt; What's wrong with this company!!!! :-)

I love this quote:

&quot;This unique event is demonstrative of how Volkswagen is opening up: we
made a clear appeal to the market - potential buyers could help choose the
name Tiguan. The positive reaction shows that this is the right approach.&quot;

Let's see, let a random group of people choose between five different
inane names and this somehow says that VW is &quot;opening up&quot;.  Heck, the only
difference is that their &quot;focus group&quot; is a bit larger and less private!

There is also a rather silly assumption that getting a committee of people
together will help design a better car.  The Edsel was designed by a
committee, the Bug and Bus were designed by brilliant engineers.
