&gt; I have a '78 2L FI that has an EGR warning light on the dash (stays

&gt; piping to connect to exhaust and support EGR.  Does anyone want to
&gt; enlighten

Hey there,

The egr light goes on automatically every 20,000 miles or so as a
reminder to check the egr equipt. If the egr stuff is no longer
installed it'll go off anyway.

It's run off of a black box that lives near the floor behind the
drivers side kick panel. The box is run off of the odometer (speedo)
cable. There should be a white reset button on it. Press the button
and the light will go off.

Hope this helps,
