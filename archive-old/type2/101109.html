Subject: Re: [T2] Need a life!

John,

Ticking where?  Might be a lot of things including generator bearing or
brush noise...get out your stethoscope and listen in various places to 
figure out where.

A long screwdriver with you on the soft end works also....just put it on 
the bone close to your ear and listen.

Don't always assume the worst!

Cheers, dave

&gt; You ever stay up late just to watch the news weather so you know how cold it

&gt; to get a life!!!!  
&gt; On a technical note, my bus engine seems to be &quot;ticking&quot; a little more than it
&gt; should (71 Westy w 1600 DP engine). I just replaced a fuel tank which was not
&gt; vented correctly, and as a result was basically starving my engine of gas. 
&gt; Will running lean for an extended period of time (3 months) cause valve damage
&gt; or the like?  The bus is running better than ever, and the ticking is not
&gt; really loud enough to be of a real concern, I just don't remember hearing it
&gt; before. What about a worn out fuel pump, will it get &quot;clickety&quot; as it starts
&gt; to wear out and the push rod pushes up and down in it? 
&gt; I did adjust valves last night, #2 &amp; #3 were a little tight, but correcting
&gt; that still didn't kill the clicking sound. It's probably just me being
&gt; paranoid, as I said the bus is running greater than ever now that I have
&gt; gotten the fuel tank thing worked out and the timing set correctly and
&gt; accurately (thanks to my new timing light!)
&gt; 
&gt; Peace, John Baker
