yeah I found one at PEP Boys (local FLAPS) for I think $29.95 it was

&gt; &gt; Hi All,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If my bus were fuel injected,
&gt; &gt; and had a Schrader valve in the fuel line,
&gt; &gt; could I check its pressure with, say, a 
&gt; &gt; tire pressure gauge? 
&gt; &gt; I have found fuel pressure gauges for no
&gt; &gt; cheaper than $75.00.
&gt; &gt; Do any flaps rent these things?
&gt; 
&gt; Sears has a fuel pressure gauge for $40.  After
&gt; I bought that, I ran across the same one at FLAPS
&gt; for a few dollars cheaper.  I didn't really want
&gt; to spend that much but what's done is done and
&gt; next time I need one I'll have it.
&gt; 
&gt; Go to www.partsamerica_dot_com and search for part number
&gt; CP7818, that's the some one that Sears carries.
&gt;
