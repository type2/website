Subject: Email error this past weekend
Date: Tue, 24 Oct 2000 15:41:57 -0400
Message-ID: &lt;LOBBIIKFHIPFKHGGLMCKIEMMDPAA.ron_at_netcarrier_dot_com&gt;
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;
Importance: Normal

A customer inadvertantly emailed Jerry De Baun a v*rus Monday morning, which
rapidly deleted a few of his &quot;inbox&quot; emails before he killed it. (Must be a
new one; Norton Anti-V*rus didn't even flag it.  If you sent us an email
with a subject heading of &quot;GR26X&quot; or something close to it, beware, you are
the one with the v*rus!)

No orders were lost, since a temporary backup is generated of each order
just to protect against such an occurance.  However, we do know that a few
emailed queries to sales_at_busdepot_dot_com or jerryd_at_ziplink_dot_net, sent over the
weekend, were deleted by the v*rus before Jerry stopped it.  So if you sent
us a query over the weekend, please resend it just to be on the safe side.
Email sent directly to my addresses, busdepot_at_email_dot_com or
ron_at_netcarrier_dot_com, were not affected.  Sorry for the inconvenience.
