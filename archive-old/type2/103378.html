Subject: Re: [T2] AC in '74 Bus

David,


Gotta disagree here.  Freon + moisture = hydrocloric acid.

If you disconnect one it should be sealed as tightly as possible....if it
has already been open to the atmosphere, just seal it well cause you will 
pay the price later.

Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt;My question is this: I noticed that my '74 Bus has A/C.
&gt; &gt;(right now the bus is not running, this is a project for me) Should I worry
&gt; &gt;about hooking up the A/C? Does anyone out there have working A/C systems on
&gt; &gt;their buses?
&gt; 
&gt; You shouldn't worry about it - you can leave it disconnected and it won't hurt anything.  I have working A/C on my '73.  Wasn't the easiest job to get it working again after 11 years (at least) of non-operation, but it is doable.
