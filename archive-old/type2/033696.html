&gt; &quot;Bus! Bus!&quot;
&gt;

We play a game with our kids (it was especially hard on the trip to
alaska this year) where they get so many points for a bug, so many for a
motorcycle and so many for a bus (VW, of course).  First one to holler
out &quot;BUS, BUS&quot; or bug or what-have-you, gets the points.

Now they even do it while we're watching movies--caught quite a few
sightings of baywindows as well as the splits this way!
