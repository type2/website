Subject: Engine starts then stops-FI virgin

He y'all
I put a 2.0 F.I. engine (known to to start and run
well) into a 72 deluxe. I pulled ou the ECU and fuel
pump and transplanted them into the 72 as well.   I
thought I hooked everything up correctly. I start it
and it starts right up, but then dies within 1 second,
like fuel starvation.  I thought I hooked everything
up correctly, but I have NEVER had a F.I. bus before,
so I don't even know where to start looking to
troubleshoot this particular problem. Any suggestions?
