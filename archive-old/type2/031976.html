I'm in the process of having a lot of work done on my 1978 bus for a
problem that started with bad blowby. (GOD I wish I had a good place to
work on my own bus this year! But no...)

Engine sounded pretty smooth, had pretty good power, had 130 +-5psi 
compression all around. But blowby was blowing up my dipstick tube and 
then splashing oil out of the tube which got sucked into the fan and 
slung all over everywhere- yuk. Bad oil leakage was my primary symptom.

A leakdown test clearly showed #4 was leaking badly. Pulled the engine, 
tore it down and found the rings in that cylinder were frozen in place 
and there was much scoring on the cylinder wall. Not burned so much as 
just frozen stuck and scraped the hell out of the jug in the process.

I'm still not sure what could have caused it, but I've since discovered 
that I have two bad fuel injectors. I now suspect that an earlier problem 
detected during a smog test that showed a highly and intermittently 
variable fuel mix may have been intermittently bad injectors and not a 
bad air flow meter (which I suspected at the time). If I had injectors 
delivering less than the prescribed amount of fuel then I was effectively 
running individual cylinders very lean, which could make enough heat to 
burn up the rings. On one night time run I noticed that my head temp 
gauge spiked way up briefly, then returned to normal operating levels. 
That could have been my rings burning out I suppose. 

Anyways, now I've got new C &amp; Ps all around, new injectors all around, an 
oil pressure gauge as long as we were in there, and everything washed up 
neat and clean after the oil spill and associated schmutz. 

I'd imagine that leakdown test plus squirting oil into the cylinder could 
tell you if it's rings or valves. (I know folks do that with compression 
tests, But does it work with a leakdown test?)

Sounds like your engine is coming out and you're spending some time 
and/or money. Try to view it as an opportunity to paint your engine 
compartment (looking hard for the silver lining here...).  :-^

Good luck,
