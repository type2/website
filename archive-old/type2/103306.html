Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Temp Gauge

&gt; My VDO oil temperature gauge shows lower temperatures (highest I ever saw
&gt; was 210 deg. F), but I also found it to be accurately calibrated.
&gt; 

i just got a temp gauge as part of my new engine from albequerque.  i found it to be 
VERY frustrating initially and stopped looking at it also. i think we have finally 
come to an understanding ;-) but i'd like a few outside opinions.  when i first got 
it in late september in new mexico driving home through grand canyon area across hwy 
50 in nevada north to oregon i rarely say temps under 220-230.  spent a lot of time 
at 240-250.  spiked to 260+ going up second gear mountains. (i stopped)  then going 
down would go to about 230-240.  this was all after i had been told by shop that over 
230 was a bad thing. so here i was with a brand new engine never under 230.  arghh. 
it was 80* some of the time. there was higher temps when sun was shining on bus. i 
figure there were all these new parts breaking in causing friction = heat.  so i just 
kept going. albeit frustratedly.... i did not drive faster than 65 usually 60.

so now i am in oregon. it is much cooler. oct. nov dec drive around mostly at 180! if 
i floor it up a hill it goes to 220. can cruise 70mph at 180 provided no wind. wind 
drives it right up to 220. inclines that do not require slowing but are long and 
constant raise it too.  so it seems to be functioning adequately.  Just drove home 
from Seattle at 70 mph 180 for 4.5 hrs till i hit wind then slowed to 65 and 
maintained temp. for additional hour.

spent january in arizona and california. found that it generally cruised at 180* 
except for going up techachapi pass then crept up to 220.  around the country side in 
teh 70*s it seemed to hang on the high side of 180 at 60 + mph. one day leaving 
phoenix temp went up but highway gained elevation and temp was 80* still not over 
220.  (i did get it to go to 250 once by accidentally forgetting to shift into 4th 
but that was the only real spike)
drove 20 hours in one day up i-5 maintained 180-190 the whole way except the peaks of 
the northern mountains going into oregon. but that is common.

so my question is what about those hotter temperatures initially. now it seems ok but 
what are the limits.  what is the 'red line'?? i think it is logical for the engine 
to be hotter in hot climate or outside temps but how does that affect what to do?  i 
sure can't drive around at 50 to keep the temp below 200 in summer so in summer is 
220 ok and winter 180???
i have driven aircooled vw buses since 78 and bugs since 74. never had a problem 
always just made sure i never drove with my foot to the floor or the engine screamin. 
  so new tricks for an old dog who is very skeptical and inexperienced with the 
parameters and their clues of gauges.
