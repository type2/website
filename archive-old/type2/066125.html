&gt;Hey all:
&gt;Anyone out there into aviation who would be willing to snag an extra one of 
&gt;those &quot;Dead Stop&quot; or &quot;Stop Dead&quot; or &quot;Head Shop&quot; or whatever they are called 
&gt;things? I really would like one as I suspect my 73 Bug is trying to kill me, 
&gt;but I don't hang around airports much. OK, I don't hang around them at all. 
&gt;So if anyone has an extra, I'll pay for it and the shipping 

&quot;Dead Stop&quot; dectors are available from Aircraft Spruce and Specialty Co.

 From their '96-'96 Catalog the P/N is 09-35600
 
Cost is $2.90 each or $2.50 each for 5 or more.

They can be contacted at 1-800-824-1930

They have a min charge of $10 and UPS COD+Handling of $9.50

Usually disclamers apply.
