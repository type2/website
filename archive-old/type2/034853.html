Subject: Re: gas heater wanted

&gt; A friend is looking for a gas heater for his '71 Westy project. He would
&gt; prefer the BA6, complete and working. I offered to ask y'all. Anything
&gt; out there?
&gt;

You may have a small problem with the word 'complete'. When I removed the
BA6 from my 79 parts Westy, there was a few parts I could not remove: the
welded on supports for the main unit and the rectangular duct that goes up
under the back seat wall for inside air. That duct went between the rear
torsion bar tube and body. Never could remove it....seems as though it was
put in before the torsion bar tube.
