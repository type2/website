Subject: push rod tubes

This may seem like a silly question, but, is there a trick to installing new
push rod tubes in a 1600 DP engine.  We are having
_ell....
Ken says he knows he used to do this a long time ago on our other bus back
in the mid '70's... and it was never this hard.
Any ideas would be appreciated
