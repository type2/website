&gt; Looking for a good compact, easy to read digital multimeter that

maybe I'm just an old fart, but I never did like the digital multimeters,
give me a big old analog dial....easier to read on the fly... also have an
audio setting on the meter for continuity that way you don't have to watch
it while you have your head in the engine bay..

mine are mostly all Radio Shack
