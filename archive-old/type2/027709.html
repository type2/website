I have been unable to reply to John Hartranft, he requested the dimensions 
of my wheel ramps. I have sent three separate emails and I have received a 
message for each one saying they could not be delivered to his address. So 
if you get this please let me know so i can send you the info at the right 
address. If anyone else is interested in the specs email me.
