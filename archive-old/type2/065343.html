&gt;If your conversion used a louvered window from a '70's bus, your best
&gt;bet it to replace the whole unit with a used one. It should come out
&gt;easily if you undo the 20 or so screws holding it in around the inside
&gt;edge. I'm pretty sure it is the same size as the nice sliding
&gt;windows seen on '80's buses too, if you wanted to put one of
&gt;those in instead. I saw a '70's bus with an '80's window and no
&gt;apparent mods necessary. Can anyone out there confirm this?
&gt;(ANyone with a tape measure and the right buses in the 
&gt;parking lot COULD confirm this...)
&gt;
&gt;I'll bet you could get a used window off a parts bus for a price you would
&gt; like.
&gt;
I have used louvered windows from a couple of 70's buses I've parted out.  
Would sell them for $20 apiece. 
The sliding window used on the Vanagons was NOT the same size.  However, VW 
did make a limited number of buses with similar sliding windows, in '78-79, 
which would fit. This is probably what you saw (it looks just like the 
Vanagon window).  I believe I have one or two of these if you are 
interested, although frankly I prefer the louvered windows provide because 
they have better ventilation and come with the bug screen.
