Subject: [T2] what a friend we have in theeeee, list ( slight return )

I would like to share a short story with those of you who read this post
about the value of this list and the extended family within which those of
us on this list live.

I will keep this brief and to the point:

A short while ago I sought advice on this list regarding a suspected ( and
now confirmed ) rippoff mechanic who was working on my engine.
His diagnosis is not important ( read Volkspares engine breakdown- Andrew
Davies if you would like ALL the facts )....but he kinda had me over a
barrel and was trying to extract £750-£800 out of me for the work.

I posted to the list and received many replies.........here's the amazing
bit:.........I also received a FREE engine to keep my van and family on the
road...and an introduction to someone I believe to be a better mechanic and
more of a human being who, in exchange for some VW autobilia installed this
engine with all of MY ancillaries .....well, FREE.

I have had VW's since leaving school and don't need to go on about how much
they cost to keep on the road, but they have always given me a sense of
belonging to SOMETHING..........flashing of headlights, waveing _at_ eachother
and a genuine interest in each others vehicles.

But in todays money grabbing society to be shown generosity and concern on a
level such as this is truly inspiring...........even though our vehicles may
breakdown, our solidarity conspires to make everything better again in the
morning.

I recently shared a joke with someone as to the merits of sending large
quantities of VW's to Israel and &quot;Palestine&quot; .....the result would be
interesting.
A vehicle that crosses and ignores colour, creed, religion and social
standing.........ironic when you think of their design history.

What I'm trying to say I guess is, ..............thank you !  to the list
and to Andrew.

Garp
71 Dormobile........no longer hungover.
