Subject: Re: [T2] new door handles...

how tight are your screws you want them tight but not with a whole lot of pressure on them.

try to loosen the screw a bit might open better then but not sure?
my doors were real tight to open from outside and tried that and worked a little bit better anyways.
peace
CHa
just a guess by the way.
