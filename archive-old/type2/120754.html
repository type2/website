&gt;Also you need a torque wrench that is within its spec range at 10 ft-lbs.
&gt;Most torque tools are rated to accuracy between 20% and 100% of torque
&gt;range, which means a wrench that is rated to near 10 ft-lbs at the low end
&gt;of the scale may be very inaccurate at this torque. You need a very small
&gt;ft-lbs wrench or an inch-lbs wrench for this job. Unfortunately you cannot
&gt;do all the fasteners on an engine with one torque wrench, the range is too
&gt;broad.

I was working on my wife's Acura last weekend doing a valve adjustment and many bolts had torque specs like 7.2 ft lbs and even lower. I recommend having a 2nd torque wrench that goes to 20 or 25 ft lbs (250 or 300 inch lbs). It's good for the rocker arm nuts, the drain plug, strainer bolt, sump plate, oil cooler nuts, etc.

The 20-100% range is govered by an ANSI standard. If your torque wrench is ANSI certified you'll have an idea of what the accuracy range is and perhaps the level of accurary within that range if it's been calibrated. If it's not you'll have no idea. For low torque fasteners you are better off using an inch-pounds torque wrench because the error will be in inch-pounds obviously.

There's a good graph in the snapon catalog that shops the lever of error outside the 20-100% range. It's an exponential curve so if you're torque wrench is rated for 10-100 ft. lbs the values between 10-20 ft lbs. can be grossly in error.

If you have a click type torque wrench I've heard It's also good practice to set it to the lowest setting when not in use (storage) to relieve the tension on the spring and keep it accurate for longer.
