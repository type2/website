I could take the low road and blame the Bus Depot for just about everything
that's given me trouble on my bus.  The reason for that is when something
breaks, they have whatever part I need to fix it.  Problem is that they
don't sell experience or skill.  For example, there should be a lenghty
disclaimer attached to every fuel tank sending unit that they sell that
states what a PITA replacement is.  That replacement nose panel I bought a
few years ago didn't mention anything about knowing how to weld either.
Hmm, let's see, what else?  Oh yeah, the replacement exhaust system I
bought when I was on vacation in Nags Head, NC that they shipped to me in
two days (even though I had it shipped 3-day, go figure) didn't include
anything mentioning needing a hacksaw to remove the old system. It didn't
even come with a box of Band-Aids and I needed those too.  Don't even get
me started on the Neosporin...

I've been buying stuff from the BD for quite a while now and have had
nothing but good luck.  The only time I had a problem was with the nose I
ordered.  It had been damaged in shipping and Ron had actually warned me
about it before I bought it.  I wanted it anyway so it showed up and was
damaged just like he said.  I decided I didn't like it so he sent me
another one.  I think we haggled for like a half-second or so before he
sent me the replacement.  The only complaint I have about the whole process
is that nobody ever came to pick up the old nose so I ended up with two!  I
wanted to make the extra one into a bar but for some reason my SO didn't
think it was as cool as I did.  Women.

I remember when Ron was just the Bus Broker and not the Bus Depot.  I had
contacted him a few times when I was looking for a bus and he was always
helpful.  I had no idea that he was going to turn that activity into a
full-blown business but he has and it's a good one.  My thanks again for
the good service and prices.  A few days ago Ron mentioned something about
not being able to offer dealer-quality service.  I hate to say it but in my
experience &quot;dealer-quality&quot; is an oxymoron.  Another thing, have you
noticed how many emails there are from the Bus Depot in the archives?  I
think Ron reads every post.  Granted it's in his best interest but it shows
a level of commitment that you don't get very often today.
