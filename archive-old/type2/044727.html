This is a FART. We went round and round about it early this year.

But let me update with this: for one year now, I have had to do zero
unscheduled maintenance on Peregrine, my '76. I haven't driven many
thousands of miles, but I have taken her on a relatively long trip and I
use her as a daily driver.

No unscheduled repairs. She hasn't even stalled.

I have it on good authority that there are a number of people on this
list who share my experience. It's a matter of learning the mechanics,
getting the knack, developing the right attitude, and shelling out some
money. Much less money, though, than for a newer car that won't be any
more reliable in the long run.

Not everyone agrees, though. That's why this is a FART.
