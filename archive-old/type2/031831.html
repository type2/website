Subject: Re: [T2] Erratic loss of power (again)

Joel,

Had this problem once in a bug with a holley carb.

I had rebuilt the carb and it was running great.  On the way to work,
bam!..no power, but idle perfectly.

To make a long story short, when I took it apart, there was a small piece
of fuel line type rubber in the float bowl.  It would semi float until it
happened to cover one of the main jets and then no more power until I
turned the engine off and it would sort of &quot;float&quot; away from the jet.

Just a suggestion.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Volks,
&gt; 	I posted this question a few weeks ago and got some great
&gt; responses. I have gone through them all, but so far NOTHING has
&gt; worked.
&gt; Here's the problem:
&gt; 	'73 bus with the 1700 pancake engine, webber progressive
&gt; carb.  Sat in a garage for 8 years until the owners asked me to get
&gt; it running. Everything works great now, except for a sporadic power
&gt; loss. The engine will idle, but has no power whatsoever to get the
&gt; bus moving. There seems to be no warning that the power loss will
&gt; happen, and there seems to be no method to it. Sometimes it happens
&gt; when the bus is sitting at a stoplight, other times it happens when
&gt; the bus is driving. Some days there is no power loss at all, and the
&gt; next day it happens three times! Then the next day it happens once.
&gt; The only thing that is consistant is that the engine is always warmed
&gt; up when it happens, and after I replace or clean something, the bus
&gt; runs great. Then I give it to the owners and they call me the next
&gt; day and tell me it's happened again.
&gt; Here's what I have done:
&gt; 	Changed Coil
&gt; 	Changed Condenser
&gt; 	Checked fuel lines for blocks
&gt; 	Checked fuel tank for blocks
&gt; 	Cleaned out and rebuilt carb
&gt; 
&gt; Any more suggestions?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Joel  74'  Westy
