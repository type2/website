Subject: Blinking alternator light/Faulty ground?

Hi listmembers,
For some time now, I have noticed that sometimes my
red light glows on and off with my blinkers as they
blink. This is completly random, sometimes doing it
and sometimes not. The red light also sometimes glows
very faint and then bright for a few blinks. This
behavior does not correlate with any other actions
that I can account for (stepping on brakes, headlights
etc.). I have cleaned up the ground wires for the rear
lights where they connect to the rear of the engin
compartment, but the funny behavior continues. Is
there any obvious place I should look first. As
always, everyones help is greatly appreciated.
