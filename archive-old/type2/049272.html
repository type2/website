Subject: [T2] heater cable broke

Hi all

I was installing some new heater cables in my 73 today. The left cable has a
hooked end that hooks though the lever in the dash. The right cable has a
loop that loops onto the hooked end. Well...the hooked.  end busted off..
Any ideas on ho to rig this up to work?. The cables are brand new and I
waited 2 weeks for them cause they were backordered from calimports..
