Subject: WTB 77-79 westy in good shape asap

Hey all,
An artist friend called tonight and wants to buy a 77-79 westy.  She is
is in need of an adventure and will travel around north america in it
over the coming year.  She is a total novice, so hoping to find her a
nice well maintained bus, preferably with a recent rebuild.  Best would
be rebuild with hydraulic lifters, as this eliminates one thing that she
would need to learn how to maintain. Located in Atlanta but willing to
travel, again preferably in the south east but for the right bus she
would fly me to pick it up. Thanks,
scoob '77 westy &quot;cassidy&quot;
