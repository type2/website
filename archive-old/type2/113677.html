Subject: Re: [T2] DIY Paint

Oh yeah, got to avoid accidents 'cause the paint is unstable and generally 
explodes on collision contact. They tried to introduce a new line of colors 
back in the 70's on Pintos but we all know what happened there. The fires 
really didn't have anything to do with the gas tanks...

&lt;grin&gt;

&gt;Nitrocellulose lacquer, IIRC...There's still a product around called
&gt;&quot;Japan Drier&quot; for speeding up the drying time of oil based enamels.
&gt;And for no particular reason, here's another bit of paint trivia...
&gt;Model T's were almost all black because the demand for the car
&gt;was so great that the drying time for the paint was causing a
&gt;bottleneck in production. The black paint dried the fastest, hence
&gt;most T's were black... ;-)
