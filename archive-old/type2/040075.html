Subject: don't mix and match heat exchangers

My left side heat exchanger on my '74 Westy developed a crack.  This is one 
of the exchangers that VW replaced under the LeCoz deal a few years back.  I 
took it to a welder and had him fix it up.  Cost me $50 and 2 cases of beer.  
If you think that sounds expensive, you should try to find someone that can 
weld steel and cast iron together any cheaper.

Well I guess all that heat warped things a bit, so I couldn't get it to fit 
right.  I found another Dansk exchanger at JC Whipme for $150, and was 
delighted that it looked very good and bolted up tight.  The problem is that 
it is a bit different than the older Dansk exchanger, and the flange to mount 
my S&amp;S exhaust was much higher.  After much prying and loosening everything 
up, I got it in.  The S&amp;S muffler tucks up under the rear apron and muffler, 
and now wants to rest against the rear engine hanger.

So I'm thinking that if I replace the right side, then both will line up.  
However, with both exchanger flanges located higher up, my S &amp; S will not 
fit.  I'm not sure about the stock muffler setup.

When I first installed the S &amp; S system on my old exchangers I thought it 
went too easy.  It lined up perfectly and all of the connections lined up 
great.   Oh well, live and learn.
