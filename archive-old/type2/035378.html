the hoover cd is a compilation of 800 some-odd pages of sermons,advice, and 
essays from bob hoover. its available from bus depot. very highly 
recommended.

im not sure about using &quot;the pink stuff&quot;....id be afraid of moisture getting 
in between the sheet metal and the insulation and rusting (the way carpet 
can do to floor pans)

i could be wrong though

&gt;
&gt;     I would like to learn more about this also, what is the Hoover CD that
&gt;your refer to and what was the recommended foam and installation technique.
&gt;
&gt;     When I removed my side panels I simply installed pink-glass based
&gt;insulation. I read that other bus owners had done that. What do you know
&gt;about that?
&gt;
&gt;Thank-you
&gt;
