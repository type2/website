Hello All,
    I assume I am not alone in my new found hatred for the #2 plug. Changing 
the plugs on my '77 went well 'til I got to #2. Got it out fine, could NOT 
get the new plug in, working by feel of course, 'cause you can't see a damn 
thing. To make matters worse, the plug socket with the plug in it fell off 
the extension, and is now somewhere between the tin and the head. I've been 
at this ONE plug for over an hour now, and am losing patience quickly. Any 
suggestions?   TIA, Jeff S
 .
