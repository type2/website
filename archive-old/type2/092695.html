Subject: Re: [T2] Are these new or restored? - 2002 Type 2


&gt;If these guys are taking the time to be swapping belly pans on Bugs to
&gt;get them into the US--they aren't in jepordy of spending some Johnny
&gt;Cash time in the slammer?

The loophole is that the frame number is the one that counts. The pop 
riveted body number is an easy transfer.

So you've got to do the same with the bus - you've got to get that frame 
number moved. Can you move that portion of the frame rail??? Probably? Do 
you want to risk $20K? Probably not.

The Mexi-Beetles folks are within the law believe it or not.

Yes I'd love to have a new bus but the bank doesn't loan $20K for '73 
busses!!! &lt;grin&gt;
