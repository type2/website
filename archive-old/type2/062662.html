Subject: RE: Getting off Lug Nuts (was: Helping a Fellow Vw'er)

I must not know how to choose cross bar lug wrenches.  I've broken the
socket wall of one and the x-weld of another, escaping injury both times
but now twice shy.  So I like a big flex-head wrench and a six-point socket,
which scares the lug nuts when you show it to them.  Equally important is 
taking off any nuts that Gas Station Bozo has air-hammered on and putting
them back on with anti-seize and correct torque.  

One of the tire places here in North Jersey, EuroTire, has always impressed
me because the shop is really clean and they mount the wheels with a torque
wrench after looking up the specs on their computer.  Can't imagine why the
dealer doesn't respect their own cars enough to do the same.
