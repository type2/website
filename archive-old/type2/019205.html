Thank you to all who responded. The &quot;loveboat&quot; rides again! I went with my
instints ala John Muir. I just started her up and listened to her with my
heart. After listening to her for awhile I realized she had an ever so
slight whine. I put a couple of clamps on the fuel injection air hoses
wherever one could go and restarted her. No more whine. I eased her out of
the drive and gently went up the street and then let her loose. She leapt
and bound with the joy of being released from the driveway! I cruised around
for 15 minutes putting her through her paces and she is now strong and
virile. Thanks once again.
Peace,
Howie '77 Westy
