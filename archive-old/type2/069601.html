If he/she/it had, you wouldn't be having problems.  My experience has
been that a six volt starter in a twelve volt bus *always* works,
until it melts.  Pretty much all or nothing.  Also, the engine usually
starts a lot sooner using the six volt starter, because it spins so
much faster.

I didn't have any problems getting the Gerbil to start until I
replaced the six volt starter with a twelve volter.  Soon after that,
I had to install a booster relay.  Even with the voltage drop from
running to the front and back, there was still way more power than the
six volt starter needed (not that it was particularly good for the
switch or wiring, admittedly).  The reason I changed starters was that
I got a new engine that had the larger flywheel on it, and the old
starter's bendix just won't mesh with it.
