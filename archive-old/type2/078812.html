Welcome to the type 2 world

Bob

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt;    My name is Chris Huggins and I live in Boston Mass.
&gt; I just got my hands on a '73 type 2 bus with a dual
&gt; carb 1700cc type 4 engine in it. This is the first car
&gt; I've ever owned. I've been a bike advocate my whole
&gt; life. But when the bus was offered to me for free. I
&gt; thought it might be a good chance to learn some stuff
&gt; about internal combustion engine and if I was lucky
&gt; have a vehicle that could haul me and my bikes around
&gt; on occaission. I already ordered a new head for the
&gt; one that was cracked from VW Goldmine in CA but I
&gt; still need four new pistons and rings. They have them
&gt; in california but shipping would cost too much and I
&gt; want to try and find them closer. Does anyone know
&gt; what the best pistons to use are and where I could get
&gt; them in the New England area?
&gt; 
&gt;
