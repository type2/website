Subject: Re: [T2] Pain(t)/body

I will not dispute what folks want for their work.  There is a wide range of effort that one can expend, as well as a wide range of materials cost.  Some  paint is $5K/gallon.  This is painstaking, time consuming, high skill, expensive work (tools, materials, time).    For example, I bought a cleaner that is used to wash the primer before the color goes on, it cost $40/gal (smells like &quot;fantastic&quot;, that is probably what it is).  My phosphoric acid treatment (a Marware product) costs $30/liter and I have used 6 liters, the Zn/Cr undercoating was $125/quart.  This stuff is not cheap, and I have yet to buy any paint.

It just seems that the pro shops do not paint cars anymore, heck, maybe they never did, I cannot exactly remember trying to get them to do so before.  I am sure that there are custom shops that will.  Maaco for $600, or a custom shop for $15-25K.

I know that I would not do the job I am doing for someone else less than $15K, and I would loose money a that.  If I ever get talked into doing this for someone else, I will ask for $20K and 1 year delivery.

I have gotten some good advice here.  I am thinking that my best coure of action is to stay the course.  I have a skilled professional available right across the street, I need to find a way to motivate him.  I am being told that I need to yell at him.  I do not know how to do that, I think that I will just ask him what he wants, and give him  some kind of incentive (an extra $1K if you get it done in 2 weeks).


My backup is to build a temporary paint booth outside using a tent or tarps.  If I do that, I think that I will use inexpensive materials (BASF LIMCO or something like that, or maybe a single stage), and plan on doing this again in 5 years.

I am blowing the primer on the interior panels now, it is gratifying to see the transformation begin.
