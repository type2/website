The shop I used to work in used that stuff on old harley and Ch#vy
motors for the same purpose. The weirdest thing I saw was bacon fat used
in a flaky rear to extend it's life? It did quiet it down, too....

Dad used to use it regular in his v-8's and i have used in some of mine
for sticky lifters (mostly damn fe block fords), The most amazing thing
dad did was free up stuck vw engine by filliing the cyclinders with MMo
and just letting it sit. He'd walk by couple times a week and push on
the crank pulley nut with a 2 ft breaker bar. On one particular engine
he finally freed it after it had been sitting for 15 years. I suppose
the age i was first introduced to it was around 70 if not before, Yea
i'm getting to be an old fart, and as ugly as the north end of a south
bound mule but thats life i guess ,,later Grin
