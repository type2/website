Subject: Re: CHT sender mounting

Scott,

I have my sender mounted outside the tin.  I welded the head of a bolt 
right next to the flange of the exhaust manifold by cylinder #3.  The 
sender is bolted on to that.  Handy for any maintenance work.  Its not 
a true cylinder head temperature - in fact, it's probably more like 
exhaust gas temperature - but its close.  What I have found is that one 
of the metal wires (&quot;the dielectric potential created by dissimilar 
metals when heated&quot;) breaks at the point where it is crimped into the 
metal ring that is used for mounting.  I fix it by opening up the 
crimp, cutting the other wire to match (in length), and then crimp them 
back in.  The trouble is, now the calibration is about 50 degrees off.  
Its OK like that, but ideally I would like it to be more accurate.
