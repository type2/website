Subject: Re: [T2] Re-calibrating AFM?

&gt; I'm aware of the implications of adjusting the spring tension on the
&gt; AFM, and that everyone says not to mess with it.  From what it looks
&gt; like to me, the way you perform this adjustment is by rotating the gear
&gt; shaped piece that holds the tension spring.  Therefore reducing tension
&gt; would result in a richer mixture and increasing tension would result in
&gt; a leaner mixture.  Am I correct?

have you thought of getting an Exhaust gas analyzer, probably cheaper than
heads.

JC Whipme has em for less than $100..probably not perfect but would be
good enough I suspect to let you know if your making things leaner or
richer and by how much...that along with the CHT might give you sufficient
information.
