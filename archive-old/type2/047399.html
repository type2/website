&gt; [snip] It's a '77 2.0 liter FI, all hoses
&gt; hooked up, all electrical connections complete and grounded, timing
done,
&gt; valves adjusted, new fuel, fuel pump operational, etc. The bus
cranks fine,
&gt; starts to start, and just as I am congratulating myself, it dies. I
suspect
&gt; the cold start valve, but I thought I would ask for suggestions
before
&gt; beginning detailed troubleshooting. I recently acquired a VOM to
test the FI
&gt; system, but I'm hoping it's something simple that I've missed. Any
help
&gt; greatly appreciated.

The cold start system can be messing you up in a couple of ways: not
providing the &quot;squirt&quot; of gas you need to start when it's cold, or,
providing that &quot;squirt&quot; when you *don't* need it, flooding the engine.
If you suspect the latter (strong smell of gas back at the engine) try
starting it with the electrical connection to the cold start valve
disconnected; if you've been trying to start it and the engine's
flooded, holding the gas pedal to the floor will give the engine the
air it needs or wait several hours, disconnect hoses to the air
distribution box, and let the gas evaporate.

&gt; I got the bus started last week and then had a major oil leak. I
determined
&gt; it was the oil cooler. I did not have time to pull the engine and
trouble
&gt; shoot - too much work/work. So I brought it to a local mechanic.
Turns out I
&gt; put washers on the case side of the studs for the oil cooler. Rookie
mistake
&gt; I guess - other wise everything seems OK.
