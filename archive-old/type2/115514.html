Subject: key broke in ignition

my key broke off in the rear hatch when I was on the last day of my trip 
back fron kansas city, mo to chapel hill, nc.  It broke off in Ashville, NC. 
I was able to superglue the two halves together and make it home. My 
girlfriend had the spare key and she was camping with no phone. The glue 
didn't last and the key broke off in the ignition. However, it was lined up 
correctly, so i was able to still stick in the top half and turn it and 
start it. Then my girlfriend came home and tried to stick the spare in and 
pushed the 1/2 of the key that was left too far down and I can no longer 
start it. So, we had a AAA locksmith come out and they couldn't get it out. 
Someone I know has a lock picking set, but no one knows how to use it. So, I 
need to know what my options are. Do I need to replace the switch. Do I need 
any special tools? Everyone keeps saying stick a screwdriver in there and 
turn. I may have to do this temporarily cause I have no $. But I don't want 
to do it if I would be destroying the switch which might otherwise be saved.
TIA
