&gt;My understanding is that there's always a cost when you go about

&gt;on the list who can find some balance, but it's never as easy

I agree.  I did a little reasarch and found that the WebCam 107i grind is
almost identical to the grind used in the stock 914 engine.  After driving
Gensler's bus and being impressed with the power of said stock 914 engine,
I think I am going to give that cam (or a similar one) a try.  If
Porsche/VW used it from the factory, I'm not worried about the specs of the
cam being inherently dangerous from a reliability standpoint.

As for the tradeoff between low and high end performance, the dyno chart
really opened my eyes.  There is torque in abundance from 1800-3000rpm.
That is typically seen in an &quot;RV&quot; type cam.  So I thought to myself, &quot;how
often do I drive at 1800rpm?  Or 2000rpm?  2500rpm?  I watched my driving
for a while and found that occasionally I dip down to 2000rpm but most of
the time, my shift points keep the engine between 2500rpm and 4000rpm.  The
reason of course is that the poor little engine just can't make any useable
power at 1800rpm, even with (relatively) good torque.  Bottom line - I
don't care if I lose some low end.  I won't miss it, and the tradeoff will
be a good one.  What I would like to do is raise the entire torque curve
about 500rpm.  I want to move that tabletop torque curve of 1800-3000rpm up
to 2300-3500rpm.  Since horsepower is a function of torque vs. rpm, this
will increase horsepower a good bit over that entire range, and probably
not decrease it much below 2300 since a 500rpm upward move in the torque
curve is really not that radical.

&gt;One of the most interesting things I've heard of late is that
&gt;AVP uses the same cam for hydraulic as they do for solid lifters.

That IS very interesting.  I wonder what the specs on it are?
