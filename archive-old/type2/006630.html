Hellllo -

I'll be in the Orlando, FL area in April. Anybody know of a Rent-a-Wreck
that has VW's in that area? I don't want to rent from a private party
(insurance, etc..).

OBC:

1) I got many pmails saying the cot can go into the washer, gentle cycle,
and mount it to dry. I'll do that tonight, and report back, captain. And it
mounts above the cabinet into that canvas bag, etc... It just looks a bit
odd sticking out the front of the cabinet, though.

2) My passenger door lock (turning the key yielded no results) is fixed.
There was a phillips screw on the end of the lock itself that had come
loose. The return spring sprung into the gap, and the finger that moves the
linkage didn't. If I'd have known it was that easy to fix, I wouldn't have
waster precious bandwidth.

Thanks to all who helped.
