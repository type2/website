Subject: Gas tank pull

     Hiya everyone.  Thanks for all the advice.  Well
with everyone's words of wisdom at my disposal, I was
able to pull the tank yesterday.  It was a pain, but
not too bad.  I tried to pull it without removing the
engine, but as most people said, that was near
impossible.  But it was close, so instead of pulling
the whole engine, I just lowered the engine about 2
inches which was just enough to wiggle the tank out. 
Putting it back in might be the crux.  I was surprised
to find that it was not a dusty and rusty wasteland
inside as I had frequent nightmares about.  Rust is
almost non-existant maybe due to the fact that there
was still alot of fuel in the tank.  However there
were assorted things waiting to be sucked into the
fuel system to cause problems.  Plastic ketchup
wrapper, chunks of a rubber hose, and numerous bugs. 
Should the chunks of rubber concern me?  As in a piece
of hose that I need to replace somewhere?  Also, I
asked around looking for the por-15 stuff and couldn't
locate it anywhere.  Will I be ok just flushing the
tank out with gas and reinstalling since there is no
rust?  Thanks again for all the help.
