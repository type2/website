Subject: Re: [T2] Re: New Parts


&gt; This seems to be the new &quot;hot&quot; item at Pick-n-Pull.  I went in yesterday for
half off sale and was
&gt; surprised to see that every Bus in there was missing, not only the tranny,
but also the front beam and the
&gt; rear hub assemblies.  It made my job easy though as I was looking for a
wheel and came away with a nice one
&gt; with excellent tire that I didn't have to take off for about $12.

Here in central California, that has been the norm for the past 4 years. Along
with all bus transaxles, they are getting removed before the bus even settles
on the stands. Crews come up from Mexico at least once a month and rape every
bus. In addition, the new 'hot' item is the lower sliding door channel. They
cut out the whole outer edge, 6&quot; into the bus and 3&quot; past the ends. Plus they
grab all the front doors!
