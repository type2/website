I must of missed the original message for this thread.  I've been out of town.

I am currently parting out the carcuss of a 78 Westy.  It has a (what I
think is a) owner built camper interior with Z bed, sink base, table and
cabinet as well as extra seat.  All birch construction and in good
condition.  I don't have a use for this but don't want to throw it away.
IT'S YOURS FOR $50.  Come and get it!

Have fun
