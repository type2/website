&gt;Hello Guys   I have been taking a 2 inch  7 mm fuel hose , splitting it

I use the same technique in many sizes and ways from re-closing harness 
sheathing to insulating fuel lines, as well as grommet duties. I spiral cut 
this hose as well for some applications and just wind it on. It is not 
stock, but is very functional for several uses. Get a stock of a foot or 
two of each of the many sizes of the Continental hoses just for such 
utility. Hose inside hose expands the range of uses.
