&gt; -Finally, I've read about pop tops for Westies being easy to replace, but
&gt; what about for Rivieras?  This is the only one I haven't tried to look up,
&gt; so apologies if the info is at my fingertips somewhere.  Does anyone sell
&gt; reproductions (e.g. yellow vinyl straight-up pop tops)?

They're hard to find.  I looked and looked for a Riviera top, couldn't find
one in good shape.  Decided to put a Westy top on the Riviera- they're easy
to find.  Also, you can use Westy seals on Riviera tops.  Replacement
canvases are available.

Have fun, Nik
