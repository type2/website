&gt;Other observations:  Mobil 1 10w30 gave good pressures until temps hit 
&gt;80s in the midwest.  Then, idle pressure stayed fine but running 
&gt;pressures dropped to 40psi (from 50 cold).  I changed to a 50/50 mix of 
&gt;10w30 and 15w50 and have been very happy with the results even in the 
&gt;south.

Moving to a thicker oil is a good idea. Why didn't you decided to dump all of the 10w30?

&gt;Brazilian Bosch points were severely pitted after only 5000 miles.

This has always been my experience with points, no matter where they come from. Have you considered using the Pertronix?

&gt;Fuel mileage has averaged a touch over 20 mpg with a range of 17-23.  
&gt;With a few exceptions, we run 60 mph when it's cool and 55 when it's 
&gt;hot.  A few times we've had to run 65-70 for safety reasons, and the 
&gt;bus handled it fine, but head temps climbed about 25 degrees per 5mph 
&gt;and fuel econmy dropped about 1mpg per 5mph.

You're maxed out and doing really well for points based ignition.

&gt;The hydraulic valves are nice.  I've been across the country adjusting 
&gt;valves along the way, and it's not my favorite rest stop activity!

Agreed.

&gt;The bus has started &quot;popcorning&quot; slightly on deceleration.  I'm looking 
&gt;for exhaust leaks but nothing obvious.  For now, I guess I'll ignore it 
&gt;if nothing turns up.

You could be leaning out too much.
