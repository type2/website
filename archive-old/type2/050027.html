Subject: [T2] Jalousie

Hey folks, Shawn Soucy here.

1.  Just went to the local boneyard and picked up a bunch of parts for
Daisy the '76 westy.   VDO clock, original two-tone visors, blower fan,
and a dual dizzy.  My question is...  I also have a '73 transporter with

a 009 dizzy and I'd like to try the dual dizzy that I picked up. Will
the '78 dizzy (2000 FI) work for the '73 1800 single carb???
The donor was a '78 transporter converted to a camper (no pop-up), but
someone put some serious time doing that, and well done. (Sad to see
someone's pride and joy being thrown around by a fork lift.)

2. I haven't seen too many posts about used parts here in Vancouver BC.
Do y'all know of the stuff here?  Apparently there's a yard in Maple
Ridge (30 min. east) that has  quite a few VW's.  Sorry I don't know the

name yet.  I'll post when I find out.

3. I have a brand new front nose panel for the '76 and I've decided that

the damage is repairable and thus don't need the skin.  I'll let it go
cheap if any of you are interested.  It cost us $218.71 Can. _at_
www.vwcalimports_dot_com   .

4. Andrea (my partner) is German and she says that the jalousie windows
are actually spelled schalousie -  meaning blinds.  I'm french and I'm
sure that jalousie means jealousy.  Makes sense to me.

Take care and Happy New Year!!!

Shawn Soucy
