If you're saying that there's no magic nut that adjusts your torsion bar
and raises your back end, you're correct. (don't think that it could not
have been engineered, My 88 Toyota truck has this wonderful method of
adjustment for the front end.)

Torsion bar adjustment on a bus must be done the hard way by physically
readjusting the bar. And you can't just remove the trailing arm and move
it over one notch on one end. Both ends of the torsion bar must be moved
in the adjustment process.

Okay, who has the website that shows this being done.

Air shocks are okay, so long as the torsion bars are carrying the
majority of the weight.

Any remedy for saggy butt syndrome in a 1979 Westfalia? There does not
seem
to be a torsion bar adjustment in this year? Do they make adjustable air
shocks
for a '79? I see Chevy Astro Van 85+ recommended but for an older Westy.

Laura :o)
