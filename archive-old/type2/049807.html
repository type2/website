&gt; I have the same type problem, but I have a 1970 kombi, and I to have
&gt; replaced all the wheel cyls. and the master.  I have bleed the system out
&gt; to the point that it two big bottles of fluid but the pedal still goes
&gt; almost to the floor.

Either your brake shoes are badly adjusted or your pin on the master
cylinder is adjusted too short.
