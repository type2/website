Subject: 50's Repro vinyl seats.

Howdy all!

I'm just about to lay out a few hundred to redo the seats in my 
'57 bus and '59 singlecab and want to get some input from hopefully a 
few past WCM customers.

They advertise vinyl repros that cover from like '50 to '67.  I don't 
know for sure, but I thought the style of vinyl changed during those 
years from a move solid textured (like is in the back seat of my '57) 
to a more open weaved style (like in a buddy's '64).

I want an accurate repro since this is going to cost quite a bit.  
Maybe Clara or Thom have some advice?  I've heard good things about 
WCM's products.

Thanks!
