Final culprit: spark plug gap
Symptom: intermittent miss

Don't be a fool like me.  In my haste to locate an 
intermittent miss through diagnosis and part
replacement, I overlooked a simple detail.  I never
had to gap the plugs I've got from my FLAPS - 
they had always come gapped correctly..  

So I'd replaced the plugs, wires, cap, rotor, 
tightened vacuum leaks, set timing, tested 
distributor, popped open my AFM (it's gotta 
be that darned fuel injection right?! - nope - 
it's already been remanufactured..), did all 
kinds of experiments with the temp sender..,
ordered a coil, got impatient and bought a 
coil locally only to receive the ordered one
the same day upon returning from an 
unsuccessful test drive...  Decided to 
inspect spark plugs - excessive spark
plug gap - shizam!  

Did the full test drive on the interstate
and didn't miss a lick!

Lesson: don't forget the details!

Thanks to all who helped out with suggestions,
