&gt; hey guys and gals, i have a stewart warner southwind gas heater for a bus
&gt; model #8332b-12V.
&gt; I have run the gas line with a filter in it and i have had it running for
&gt; only a few seconds ,
&gt;  but it backfires and then theres no fire..i have resoldered the condenser
&gt; for better contact,
&gt; but it has not helped...any ideas? also after it backfires i smell raw
&gt; gas...thanks joe
