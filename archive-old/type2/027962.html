I think I solved the alternator/regulator problem. It was the regulator. Replaced that and *THAT* problem has been replaced with a new one. 

I cranked her over a little (coil wire off; no gas) and could still smell something, though the alternator/regulator wires weren't warm at all. So I had my wife crank her over for me and a bunch of smoke came up from underneath. I had her stop and I crawled under as quickly as possible. Feeling around on every wire, but all were cool. Then I happened to touch the clutch cable tube. Yowsa! That puppy was as hot as an electric eel. I could see that what was happening was that the grease inside this was burning.

Other interesting symptoms:

I have continuity (about 50% on my ohm meter) between my positive battery cable and the chassis of the bus. When I remove the big cable from the alternator (at the starter); I no longer have this problem. I just inspected the cable today and it's not broken. This is the alternator I had tested this morning and it works fine. I have the continuity with or without the plug into the voltage regulator...and regardless of what other wires are connected or disconnected.

I thought this meant that I had a dead short in my alternator, but I don't think it would have passed the alternator test on the test stand if that were true.

I'm really stumped on this one. Any ideas, theoretical or practical would be appreciated.

Thanks! Joe
