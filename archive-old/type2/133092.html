Subject: Re: [T2] CHT Gauge Accuracy

Tim,

What kind of oil temps when you see 475-500???

I shoot my cheapie infared at the oil filter....so, if you really have 
head temps in the 500's, then what kind of oil temps?

WHat kind of extension wires did you use for the gauge...makes a 
difference.  

Pull the #3 plug, and test the cht sender in a pot of boiling water...or 
the oven, or both....ovens have been known to be off quite a bit...try a 
digital turkey type thermometer at the same time.

Cheers, dave

&gt; I have a brand new (not rebuilt) set of heads on my stock '79 2.0L

.  I also installed a VDO 
&gt; cylinder head temp gauge with the sender under the #3 spark plug.
&gt; 
&gt; On the road at 60 mph, 75 degree ambient temperature, my CHT reads 475. 
&gt;   If I increased speed to 65, the CHT would climb to over 500.  This 
&gt; seemed high to me and freaks me out.  I don't want to burn up this new 
&gt; set of heads.  Since the engine runs perfectly, hot or cold and 
&gt; everything should be in order with the engine, timing, etc., I began to 
&gt; question the validity/accuracy of the CHT gauge.
&gt; 
&gt; So yesterday I got my hands on one of those infrared laser pointed 
&gt; remote thermometer devices.  This is not a cheapie, but a $300 Raytek 
&lt;snipped&gt;
&gt; Raytek is giving me as opposed to the VDO gauge.  The Raytek numbers 
&gt; seem normal (i.e. 400 - 425 F) as opposed to the VDO (475 to 500 F).
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone think of any reasons that I shouldn't believe the Raytek 
&gt; numbers over the VDO CHT gauge?
