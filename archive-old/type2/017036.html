You really need to find out.  Brake systems don't leak when they
are working correctly.  This is  your life we are talking about here.

Pull the wheels and find the leaky cylinder, or if there is no apparent
leakage, get the master changed.  Just do it.

&gt; Doing some maintenance on the 69 this week, and found the brake fluid

&gt; guess there was enough in the lower reservoir above the master cylinder.
&gt; Wonder where it went? No sign of leakage on any of the wheels or MC. I
&gt; replaced most of the system last year. All new WC, all new rubber lines.
