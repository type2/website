Subject: Vanagon Ignition Switch Removal

I have the key to an '84 Vanagon that is sitting in the yards, and I would 
like to 'remove' the ignition switch for posterity,  IF ONLY I KNEW HOW ! ! 
!

So, given that the Vanagon is about to be sent to the crusher any moment 
[this means, anything goes], how would I [easily, quickly] remove [save] the 
keyed section of the Vanagon ignition switch.

The intent is to remove all five keyed elements, but the handles on the 
doors and the lock on the rear hatch should be simple...

TIA
