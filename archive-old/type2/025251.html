Thanks Bob,

Can anyone give me &quot;how-to 101&quot; on how to go about drilling a hole in my
case and getting a stud.  A specific set of steps and tools I will  need
would be greatly appreciated.

I have a junk engine case that does have the proper stud, I will use this as
my reference on where to drill the hole...
