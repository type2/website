Thanks for all the response. I did put grease on the
shaft when I last changed them. Maybe I didn't put
enough on, or maybe I rubbed some of it off fumbling
around trying to adjust them. I'll be changing the 
set as soon as there's a break in the rain here (I was
going to do it this morning, and even though the side
of the road *is* the most appropriate place for this
procedure, the rain running down my back was unpleasant and I decided to wait.) I'll be sure to put an adequate amount of grease on.

BTW, I do have a correct dual vac advance distributor.
Of course, it does me no good sitting in my glove box.
(Kinda like the brand new dishwasher still sitting in 
the box in my dining room) I'll be getting to that this
weekend hopefully. I'm sure I'll have some questions
about it for the list.

Thanks,
John
