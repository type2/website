Orange go-jo and the like are great but to really make life easy use &quot;liquid
gloves&quot;(might be &quot;invisible gloves&quot;) before doing any work. This is
apparently mostly glycerin and is akin to putting detergent on your hands
before the dirt. Grease etc just washes off in water. Make sure to get it
under your nails and they clean out easier as well. 

I just find gloves to hot and they don't protect above the wrists anyway.
