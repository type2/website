Subject: Bad Carb?

Hey All,
Thanks for the replies yesterday about my idle problems on my new 71.  Overnight, I did the WD-40 trick to try to see if I had any vacuum leaks. I do not have any.  On the 34pict 3 carb, I also notice that to get a smooth (although a little fast) idle I must turn the small Volume Control screw WAY out and the big by-pass screw all the way in to get a smooth idle.  To me, this seems like it points to my original conclusion of bad carb. Can anyone confirm or deny my assumption before I drop $175 bucks on a new carb.



Peace, John Baker
