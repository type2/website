the paypal idea is a good one...

someone might want to check on this, but...paypal has a referral bonus to 
the person that referred and a sign-up bonus for the new person.  the 
listmaster could set up an account and everyone (that was new to paypal) 
can use the listmaster as the referral, therefore giving $5 to the 
listmaster.  then the new member can give the $5 bonus they received to the 
list.  The end result....each new member ends up donating $10 of paypal's 
money to our cause.

anyway, i love this list.  tell me when and where, i'll donate.
