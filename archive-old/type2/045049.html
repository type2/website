Subject: [T2] fuel pressure testing

I am going to test the fuel pressure today and I wanted to check
somethings before I do.

First, do I want the engine running while I test it, or do I want to
disconnect the wire from the coil to the distributor.

And if I disconnect that wire that goes from the coil to the distributor
cap, do I want to ground it on the crank case?

and yes, I do have a fire extinguish at my side :)

Thanks,
Mike
