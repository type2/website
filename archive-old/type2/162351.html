&gt; I am heading from College Park, MD, to Atlanta, GA, in a couple of weeks and
&gt; will have an empty tow dolly on the way South. So, if you have a small car,
&gt;
&gt; route does not involve too many hills. Splitties should be fine.
&gt;
&gt; My route will either be I-66 to I-81 or I-95 to I-85. Let me know if you are
&gt; along the way and need help with moving one of your cars.
&gt;
&gt; Even more bus content: Everybus will be part of my trip. So hauls from

BTDT, may I highly reccomend
. 197 to Bowie
. picking up 301 South
. stay on 301 over the Nice bridge into VA
. at Bowling Green turn onto 207
. at Carmel Church (11 miles) join up with I-95 South
. at Petersburg take I-85

almost perfectly flat and at least an hour faster than any other route.
also a lot nicer, you might also be able to Carabus as I think a couple
folks are going that way.  unfortunately I will not be able to make it
this year.
