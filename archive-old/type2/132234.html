Subject: Re: [T2] What's a &quot;Pure&quot; bus?

These type 4 engines can last a long time, I've been pulling a 2,000 pound
trailer with my '76 westy over mountain passes for 3 years now and the
engine has close to 200,000 miles on it and hasn't been rebuilt or even had
a valve job.  

From what I see, it's not the engine, it's the way it's driven.  WAY too
many bus people don't know how to drive an air cooled engine and what
happens is the heads get hot and either the valve or the seat fails.  So
many people think the oil is what cools the engine, but it's not, it's the
air passing over the cooling fins.

Gotta keep these things wound up, but many people feel when they drive it
the way it's supposed to be driven they are over revving the engine, which
is just the way the engine needs to be driven.
