Hi Ben,

Sorry I didn't include this earlier.   There is a lot of good type1 engine
stuff and other general procedures (brakes) on non-bus lists.

Here you go, this is at the bottom of every message on the KG list...

This Mail is from the Karmann Ghia Mailing List. &lt;karmann-ghia_at_wdr_dot_com&gt;
For full instructions, send to &lt;karmann-ghia-request_at_wdr_dot_com&gt; with a Subject
of help.
To unsubscribe, send to &lt;karmann-ghia-request_at_wdr_dot_com&gt; with a Subject of
unsubscribe.
This Mailing List is run by Andy Caslaw. &lt;andy_caslaw_at_wdr_dot_com&gt;

I sent the help message and found out that they have an e-mail archive, not
a WWW.  Andy:  I'd be glad to  host a WWW interactive archive like I do for
the type2 list.  Let me know if you are interested.

Hi Steve,

Thanks for the response. Do you happen to have the Ghia list info available?
Is there an archive like for type_dot_com?

Thanks again for your help.
