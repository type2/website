Subject: Re: [T2] a type 4 motor, what is it?

&gt;Hello all,
&gt;  i picked up a type 4 motor that was in a 73 bus but it is kinda strange, It
&gt;has dual carbs and the oil filler is on the top of the motor on the breather
&gt;box and the dip stick is from the top as well. I looked where the bus filler
&gt;and dipstick go but there was no holes in the tin or shroud.
&gt;I copied the Case #  EA042420
&gt;  Any Ideas??

Congratulations, you have a Porsche 914 case which originally would have 
had FI. Could be stock 73 T-II dual solexes on a salvaged 914 motor.
