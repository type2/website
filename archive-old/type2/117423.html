&gt; However, one of the very first invoices I have, from 1977, was the PO
&gt; taking the bus in to have holes drilled for the front plate. Not sure
&gt; where you had to get your bus from to have them pre-driller, but this
&gt; bus was a customer pickup in Germany, then brought back to the states.
&gt; Maybe Germany did not require front plates at that time. 

where I lived in Central Germany in the late 60's required front plates,
but they were a different shape and size
