Subject: '73 Camper FS, Knoxville, TN

&gt;'73 VW Camper, Needs Love, $250.  Please call 423-633-5278.

I've seen this one, it's rough.  Has a very interesting conversion, tho-
Straight-up pop w/2person bed, a propane stove and sink, icebox,
full-width z-bed, etc.  Hit front right many moons ago, was running up to
a few months back, owner thinks battery or starter is shot(novice).  Two
windows on drivers' side are shattered, center ones are sliding models,
though not identical to later bus sliders, they have an integrated screen.
Little &quot;Formica&quot; labels all throughout the interior, which is a trash
heap.  The cabinets are probably salvageable.

Has weber in place of duals, otherwise fairly stock in the engine area.
Windscreen is still good, surprisingly.

Good parts car, that's about all's I can say.  The price is negotiable.

Contact the owner, not me.  He does not have email,
that means you'll have to log off and use the little pushpad on the phone
itself. ;)
