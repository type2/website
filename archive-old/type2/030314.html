&gt; Ok, I know the tires subject has been run into ground but all this talk
&gt; over the past week or two got me thinking.  I'll be buying tires very
&gt; soon.  Now I know the basics: load rating, max weight, max pressure,
&gt; etc. but I haven't read anything about rims (wheels.)
&gt; My '72 Westy is currently sitting on  205/70R14's.  I heard (possibly
&gt; incorrectly) that this size tire requires a different size rim than the
&gt; stock 185R14's.  Could that be true?  I believe in a lot of research
&gt; before making a major purchase such as tires and don't want to waste
&gt; this time pricing the wrong tires.  Whether this is true or not, should
&gt; I replace my tires with the same size tires and will switching to a
&gt; smaller tire increase speed/power?

A smaller tire will increase acceleration by lowering the &quot;gearing&quot;.  For
the same reason, the engine will run faster at a given speed.

Just to muddy the waters further, another consideration is static turning
effort.  Wide tires are harder to turn with the steering wheel while at a
standstill.  The steering box in '72-and-down buses is the relatively
fragile worm-and-peg box, and you certainly don't want to overstress that
expensive part!  VW went to the worm-and-roller box in '73, probably due
to breakage problems due to the switch from really narrow bias tires to
wider radials.  Having replaced one steering box already, I'm always
careful to have the bus moving slightly before turning the wheel, and
that's with 185's!
