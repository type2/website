Subject: Re: rear brake adjustment

Hi again,

 Melissa writes:

&gt; so i'm adjusting my new brakes last night.  the bentley manual doesn't 
&gt; describe which direction the stars need to turn.  my haynes manual says, 
&gt; &quot;the star towards the front goes up, the back goes down.&quot;

&gt; i found this to be false...on the driver's side.  this statement is true
on 
&gt; the passenger side.

&gt; so what's the deal..?  which way are they supposed to go?

 I don't try to remember the up/down thing. I visualise the thread on
the adjusting screw that I'm working on (they all have the same, 
conventional, right-hand thread) and identify which way the screw 
would rotate to move the brake shoe in the right direction: that is,
it would &quot;unscrew&quot; to move the shoe outwards, or &quot;screw-in&quot; to
slacken it off.

 The star then rotates in the opposite direction to have the same effect
on the shoe, so I work the prongs appropriately.

Hope this helps- depends how you like to remember things!!

Cheers,
	W.
