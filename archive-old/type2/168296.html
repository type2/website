Subject: Perfection is welding - I'm nowhere close...

I was out last night doing a little zapping on Zoe, and as usual, my welds
look like crap. I know I have heard about the benefits of using a shielding
gas such as Argon, but a few websites I have looked at said that Argon is
useful mainly for welding aluminum. I would certainly like to look at
something that is going to make the learning curve easier for me and if a
gas is the way to go, which is the correct one for MIG welding on steel?

The greatest single cause of atheism in the world today is Christians, who
acknowledge Jesus with their lips and walk out the door, and deny Him by
their lifestyle. That is what an unbelieving world simply finds
unbelievable.
