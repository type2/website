Subject: I think I've made my bus worse...

I picked up a crappy &quot;Wells&quot; coil from Autozoned for $15. Even if it only 
lasts a month, it will give me time to find a good one.

However, that didn't help.

I pulled the aircleaner off completely and found a vacuum-like connection on 
the idle mixture tube which I plugged. I replaced the wire on the condensor 
(the insulation had separated - Made in Mexico) and triple checked 
everything. Still didn't seem to be trying. Juice is getting to the coil. I 
even tried a jumper from the battery to the coil.

I advanced the timing (guessing about 5 deg) and it started trying to start. 
I was on the right track! I tweaked it back and forth a few times and got it 
to start and rev up. Once. See, it backfired and died. After that I can't 
get it to even try to start. I went and checked all the vacuum connections 
again in case the backfire blew one off. Nothing.

I have a bad back and so can only spend a couple hours at this before I have 
to stop. I want to just take it to a shop, but two things are holding me 
back. 1: Shops have to charge an arm and a leg for everything. 2: I'm kinda 
afraid they're going to tell me the engine's shot and I need a new one. 
Among other things..

I'm going to see if I can tow it to the inlaws tomorrow (getting another 
_at_$#%_at_#$ parking ticket in the morning) and decide from there what to do.

Can anybody make any suggestions about what to do? I even would have been 
happy to get it to run well enough to drive it across the street so I don't 
get any more tickets. :(
