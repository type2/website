&lt;&lt; Hey All,
Sorry for this marginal content, but does anyone know
where I can find some good line drawings of VW buses
online? I am working on a t-shirt design for a local
bus event and I need some good drawings.
 &gt;&gt;

And on a similar note...My niece lost my only print out
of a cartoon depicting the Russian space station as a
Split Window...If anyone remembers where I left that
address, please remind me... ?-(
