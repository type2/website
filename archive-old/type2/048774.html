Subject: RE:[T2] quick easy  temp heat

Get a motorcyle catalog and look at the heated coats, gloves, etc. You can 
also buy heated pads that slide under the seat upholstery and give you a 
heated seat.

Anyone found a heated steering wheel?

Personally I'm trying to duplicate my firend's '78 Riviera which is warm 
all the time - good body rubber and good ductwork and good heater boxes.

Had a '72 Euro-spec Beetle that was awesome in the snow. Would melt your 
tennis shoes!

It is possible to get enough heat out of the stock system - just not easy.
