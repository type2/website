I am running Kumho tires on my 79 Transporter. I got them at Les Schwab
which is a full service Pacific Northwest tire dealer.  They are not a M&amp;S,
but they are 8 ply with 2 ply sidewall.  The cold rating on the tires is 54
pounds.  I carry 50 in them.  I have about 6,000 miles on them and they seam
to be okay.  I still rather have a different trend design and be a full
qualified M&amp;S tire. But like you, sometimes money can't buy everything you
want.
