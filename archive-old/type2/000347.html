&gt;entering, and running with an extreme rich mixture. I dont get it
&gt;because it
&gt;was running great when i shut it off, and i really didnt do
&gt;anything to the
&gt;machanics of the engine. I only put the heater ducts together and
&gt;the blower
&gt;fan hoses on.
&gt;    If anybody has any advice regarding a similar experiance that they may
&gt;have encountered, I would greatly appreciate any suggestions.
&gt;
Ok... similar experience, check the AFM module connector. It's something you
generally don't look at cause it's around the other side from most the stuff
you look at. Sounds like the same symtoms I had once after I had done some
work on the engine. It took me about two or three hours to trace this out.
Dunno, cude bee. Might also look at the CHT sensor around the number three
intake area. Again look at the connector.

&gt;  I'm gonna get a few things on my system again, and check
&gt;specifics Thursday
&gt;during my next free hour. Till then, i'm a passenger in my girlfriends
&gt;convertible Rabbit. Atleast i get to stll ride in an old VW.
