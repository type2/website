&gt;I'm having my '71 Westy 1600 DP rebuilt, moving up to 1641cc and dual

&gt;mechanic plans to put in straight 30 wt oil.

This is probably just a matter of religion.........but here goes..........

I use non-detergent 10w oil for the first 20 minutes ( two valve adjustments
done in this time), then non-detergent 20w for the rest of the driveway
break-in.  I use an Oberg oil filter that I clean after every 10 minutes of
900-3000 RPM, up and down, never pausing, then five minutes of &quot;bumps and
grinds.&quot;  I also check the valve adjustments at this time.  After about five
hours of this (over several days), I dump the non-detergent 20w for
detergent 30w, and hit the road.

I put too much care into the building of my engines to just throw in 30w
and start driving around.  YMMMFDV
