&gt;I bought this heat shield from Patti's Parts Palace and am wondering if
&gt;anyone has one installed and can maybe send me a photo or give some install
&gt;instruction. It apparently attaches to the cooling tin above the muffler
&gt;but I am not sure how or exactly where, never had a bus with one. It has
&gt;two brackets, one with one hole and the other with 2 holes. It also looks
&gt;like it must have some nice asbestos sandwiched in it... Do I have to drop
&gt;my muffler to install?

Here's a shot of it in place:

You can see where one side screws in from above because there's a nut welded to the tin below the timing scale. I can't remember how it attached to the other side.
