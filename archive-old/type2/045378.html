Subject: Re: [T2] need tach with alarm (girlfriend abuse)

Ben Hirashima sends:

&gt; hi all. here's a problem i'm sure many of you have encountered: my girlfriend
&gt; and i bought a '77 westy together. it runs well, but i'm afraid it won't run
&gt; well for long the way she drives it. no matter how many times i scold her for
&gt; overrevving the motor, she simply cannot pay attention to the rpms. she
&gt; frequently pushes 60 in third gear. i can keep a watch on her when we're both
&gt; in the car, but who knows what evils she perpetrates on our poor bus when i'm
&gt; not around. the only solution i can think of is to install a tach that sounds
&gt; an alarm when the rpms get above a certain level. i think an annoying screech
&gt; every time the motor is overrevving would probably cure her bad driving
&gt; habits. has anybody heard of such a device? if not, do you have any other
&gt; technical solutions? forget about trying to get her to drive better - it won't
&gt; happen.

An MSD 6AL (contains rev limiter) ignition box will solve this problem by
keeping the engine below redline. It's cheaper than a new engine, anyway,
and some happy MSD users claim better gas mileage.

Of course, you could always just build an engine big enough to let her drive
60MPH in third.

It could be worse (non-Bus content follows): you could have a depressed
girlfriend or one who won't drive a manual transmission.
