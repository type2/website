Re: Do Beetles Float??

Yes...

20 years or so ago &quot;Blue Peter&quot; a UK childrens TV programme featured a Beetle
which had been made water tight, had exhaust pipes extended above the roof, and 
a propellor fitted.

This was then driven/sailed accross the Irish Sea from Wales to Ireland about
90 miles (I think).

It's rumored that this Beetle is still in existance and is currently 
undergoing resoration for more amphibeous exploits.

I have also seen pictures of an amphibious type III but this was a Type III 
body on a Schimwagen chassis.
