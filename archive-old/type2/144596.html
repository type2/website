Subject: Re: [T2] won't go

(1)  Does your engine compartment have any rust holes
on the left side of the engine compartment...as in the
same side as cylinders 3 &amp; 4?  If so, patch them
immediately.  Is the foam seal between the engine tin
and the body engine compartment, intact on the left
side? If not, fix.  An air leak caused me 5 motor
pulls and 5 sets of heads.
   
(2)  If the cooling flaps are installed, is your
left-side cooling flap stuck closed?   When running,
from underneath, without either burning yourself, or
carbon monoxide gassing yourself to death, use your
hand to sense the amount of cooling air eminating from
below the engine on the right or Cylinder 1 &amp; 2 side. 
Now feel the left or Cylinder 3 &amp; 4 side.  Is the air
flow about the same?  I should be almost the same.  If
not, something is obstructing.
    
(3)  A problem with VW Air Cooled engines is mouse
nests appearing atop the jugs on either side, under
the tin.  Mouse nests restrict air flow.  If the air
flow is restricted on the left side, consider peeking
with a pen-light through the #4 spark plug hole tin. 
Your year-long refurb may have taken-on unexpected
passengers.
   
(4)  The lack of power is suspect.  That is, if I may
infer your difficulty in driving up ramps connotes
lack of power.    If you suspect a vacuum leak, then
use an el-cheapo can of starter fluid about in the
engine compartment, aiming at the various hoses and
potential vacuum leak locations.  Especially at the
base of the carbs and cross-over pipe connectors. 
When and if you find a vacuum leak, the engine speed
flare and knocking will provide immediate feedback.
   
(5)  The noise you describe is ominous.  Do you know
of another T2 enthusiast local to where you live to
listen for themselves?  For another opinion?
   
(6)  Don't be offended, but are the carbs sync-ed?

&gt; Nearing the end of a (*) year rebuild, recon engine
&gt; now starts (last 
&gt; problem was no gas).  Runs but sounds loud (I can't
&gt; remember maybe its 
&gt; meant to sound like that).
&gt; 
&gt; Moves ok but stalls when I try and drive it onto
&gt; ramps.  Ran it for a 
&gt; while at the weekend Cyliners 4 &amp; 3 seemed to get
&gt; VERY hot, 1 &amp; 2 not so.
&gt; 
&gt; 1800 stock twin carbs
&gt; 009
&gt; Recon engine
&gt; Checked timing 7.5 deg btdc at 900 (correct for
&gt; engine)
&gt; Dwell 50
&gt; Tried blocking the Vaccuum offshoot to the brake
&gt; booster (no difference)
&gt; 
&gt; No ideas?
