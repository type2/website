Subject: Re: [T2] clutch cable

Messy job- unbolt the bowden tube holder from the trans and yank it off
the remains of the cable- grease what's left really well to help
lubricate the channel as you pull the cable from the front.  Put on
rubber gloves and start greasing the cables as you feed it into the
channel (don't grease it all first, or it will pick up every grit in
your driveway).  If you encounter resistance, feed it back and forth, 
and grip it real close to the feed tube.   Should work- if not, try
greasing more from the trans end as far as you can.

&gt; snapped my clutch cable today, way out in the desert.
&gt; I was able to drive it back by elegant shifting and
&gt; masterly driving. (Yeah, right. The jeep tracks were
&gt; ok, but those stop lights when i got back to
&gt; civilization...)
&gt; 
&gt; I got bentley and Muir and a smidgeon of experience.
&gt; 
&gt; But, before I start, does any experienced hands have
&gt; hard-won tips on getting then new one in? (Please
&gt; don't tell me that the '68 takes a cable found only in
&gt; the Smithsonian.)
&gt; 
&gt; tnx.
