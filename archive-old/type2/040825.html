Subject: Re:  Ignition &quot;upgrade

Landon, William and List:

I thought I'd add my thoughts here since I always know best :).  (My SO can
tell you all about it).

I have a '79 california spec westy with stock hall effect pointless
ignition.  I know that the hall unit feeds a signal to some kind of
amplifier which actually triggers the coil.  I don't know if this is a
&quot;CDI&quot; unit or not, but I do know the system works wonderfully.  In the 10
years I've owned this bus I have never once had the timing get off unless I
futzed with the distributor for some other reason.  The hall ignition
combined with the FI make this bus run like a modern vehicle with little in
the way of &quot;tune-up&quot; required.

I also own a '73 911 which came stock with CDI ignition but uses points to
trigger the system.  Awhile back I replaced the points with a Pertronix
unit.  So far this has been a very positive move once I got past the out of
the box, infant mortality with the Pertronix.  The 911 is a pretty closely
tuned vehicle and if the timing gets off, even a little bit, it affects
driveability.  Even though the car had a stock CDI unit which reduces
current across the points, the timing would timing drift due to wear in the
phenolic block of the points.  With the Pertronix, the timing is always
right on and driveability is much improved.

In my opinion, the first ignition upgrade I would do would be to install
pointless ignition.  Unless you have a well worn distributor, this should
all but eliminate errors in timing once it has been set correctly.  Then if
you are still not completely happy, you can install the CDI as William
suggests.
