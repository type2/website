Subject: Sunroof maintenance

OK, while I'm on the topic (and who knows why with the snow flying here 
today?)...

Where and with what does one &quot;lube&quot; the sunroof.  Ours works but takes 
what the PO called &quot;power assist&quot; (shoving on the cross brace) to get 
it started.  There is some thick grease on the aluminum tracks.  The 
cables are dry.  Are they supposed to have fibrous stuff in the middle 
or is that mildew?

Man, it's nice when it's open on a sunny day!  Probably will turn into 
a poptop, though, when a cable gives up on us :-(

cheers,
joe and rachel
