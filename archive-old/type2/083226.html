Subject: Faster-Laster off to EB

Hope to see everyone at EveryBus. We're leaving now, so If you see a
blue 7-pass bus on the side of the road w/ one really peaved off
looking lady yelling at a somewhat dejected man stop &amp; help. Otherwise
see everyone at EB. I'll be making my way from West of Nashville, TN
on I-40 &amp; up to Roan Mountain to meet w/ Ric et.al. &amp; on the EB. See
you there.
