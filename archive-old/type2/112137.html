&gt; fender well..


Problem is that with different tire sizes this measurement might vary by
an inch one way or another.

A better way is to put the vehicle on a level surface, put a 200 pounder
in the front seat, and check the deck inside the sliding door with a
level.  If it's close to level you're good!
