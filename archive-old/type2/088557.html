Hi Guys

This is another day, since you must remember the treads of the number 3 =
and 4 cylinder head are torn, next step drop the engine and take the =
head out. Well I was reading the Tom Wilson book and he advice to hold =
the tranny with another jack before drop the engine. Although mine is a =
77 Westy she looks like 71 (exported to Venezuela) with just one upper =
nut in the right inner side of the engine and a bolt in the left side) =
and the tranny is supported by some bolts to a cross member in the =
chassis, my question is I still to hold the tranny anyway ?

Thanks

Roberto
