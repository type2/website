Subject: scraping noise, rear, during turn

hi all - i have a syncopated scraping noise when turning in my 68 and it is
coming from the rear drum area. sure enough it happens when i brake, and
the drums do need a girinding! BUT the scraping also occurs when i haven't
used the brake for a longish period, during a left or right turn. the sound
is so similar as one coming from a shoe/drum. who knows what it could be -
still the drums and shoes..? tia      - steve
