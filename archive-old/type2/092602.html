&gt;   With the new switch in, now it will only crank if you push the key in

&gt; replacement one...(don't know how long it's been there).  Does anyone 
&gt; have any thoughts as to how to rectify this?  tia, Greg


I replaced today the same elec. switch contacts on one I had replaced less 
than 2 years ago. I think you got a new switch that is garbage out of the 
box. Just poor contact from bad tolerances in manufacture. You can prove 
this fault with an ohm meter.
