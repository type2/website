Throw out bearing???

&gt; Help!
&gt; 
&gt; My bus ('70, 1600cc) just sprung a new sound on me today and it doesn't 
&gt; sound good. Here's the details...
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Sound only occurs when in gear and clutch is out or being let out.
&gt; 2. No sound when clutch is depressed.
&gt; 3. It almost sounds like a tire rubbing against the frame, but it occurs 
&gt; even when the bus is standing still (if I let the clutch out).
&gt; 4. Visually inspected CV boots and they're fine -- didn't check out the 
&gt; insides yet.
&gt; 5. Bus will drive, but the sound gets worse.
&gt; 6. Happens in all gears.
&gt; 
&gt; What should I be looking for? I've got Bentley and Muir, but don't have the 
&gt; gear to pull tranny or replace CV joints (either of which I'm hoping I don't 
&gt; have to do).
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas/suggestions welcome...
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
