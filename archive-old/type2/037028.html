VW says it should get around 15MPG.

my 78 FI gets 15 or so in all big city stop and go driving, on the road
(with a good tailwind) I can almost get to 20mpg.

check the tune up of the engine.
the throttle body idle adjust has a MAJOR impact on fuel milage (in my
experience) so check it out.  but beware too lean will cause the engine to
overheat so be cautious.
