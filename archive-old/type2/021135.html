KH:
Sounds like a vacuum leak. Check hoses visually for cracks and looseness. Then
try running and wiggle them to get the idle to change.
Good luck,

&gt; I have a '75 camper and I recently did a valve and timing tune up for my bus.
&gt; After which, the idle has been rather inconsistent. When the engine is cold,
&gt; it would die for puff of gas and I cannot release the gas while I am still
&gt; trying to warm the engine, if not it would just slowly die away and stall the
&gt; engine. And sometimes, not always, it might suddenly stall (warm engine)
&gt; while I clutch in to stop or in the middle of a turn. So if anybody recognize
&gt; such symptoms, advices are more than welcome. Thanks!
