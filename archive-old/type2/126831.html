Subject: Won't start, electrical

Hey, volks.  Having a won't start, will start
after jumping, but then dies when I turn on a
load (headlights) kind of problem.  Replaced
battery with known good battery with no change in
symptoms.  Unfortunately, my analyzer is at a
friends house and I won't be able to check the
alternator/regulator per Haynes/Bentley until
tomorrow.  Suspect voltage regulator.  Am I
taking the correct path?
