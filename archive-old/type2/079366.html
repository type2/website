Subject: Plaid Interior

As of 1pm on Sunday the 28th, there was a beautiful green plaid interior in
a 77 Westy, in the pullapart yard in south Atlanta, just off Moreland
Avenue.

A tad bit of wear on the side of the driver's seat, but excellent fabric and
vinyl on the two front seats and the back seat, okay green curtains,
cabinets in good shape, oh and the cushion that goes over the engine was
excellent as well.

Also had a complete engine, though of course I couldn't tell if it ran at
all.  There was also an orange Westy, pretty much picked over, soso
cabinets, a couple of shiny VW hubcaps.

Just thought I'd pass this along in case someone around here could use it.
