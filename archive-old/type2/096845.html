Subject: friday fishwrap factoid

i'm one of those fellers that keeps a rmmw catalog close and ready.
glancing through for the millionth time i noticed an unusual part that
answered a question i pondered since the time i sold a newer instrument
cluster. got my answer: under switches and gauges vw part # 113 957 099A is
in fact known as the vibrator-exciter.     - steve
