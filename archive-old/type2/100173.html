Subject: Re: [T2] power trip

Interesting- it seems when I had problems before I just jiggled the ground
strap, and battery and it would start. I ensured good connections on the
battery - but if the ground strap is not totally in tact that might be it.
When you say &quot;use your battery jumper cables temporarily between the battery
neg and the engine case then test again.&quot; Do you mean, disconnect ground
strap, connect the cables, then try to start or are you referring to using a
volt meter?

&gt;
&gt; If I was you,, I would check the engine/trans ground strap..
&gt; The ground is common to both your problems,, and if it isn't any good,
your
&gt; starter will act up, and so will your charging,,,, and maybe your
ignition,, but
&gt; as it draws significantly less than the starter the ignition may be
getting
&gt; enough through the ground to allow it to run.
&gt;
&gt; It is easy enough to prove, use your battery jumper cables temporarily
between
&gt; the battery neg and the engine case then test again.
