I'm a science teacher and this is the safety lecture about acid:

If you get acid in your eye, you have 10 seconds to get to an eyewash
before permanent damage occurs.

If you get acid in your eye, you will be in such pain that you will not
think to get to an eyewash.  Someone else will have to get you there.  Do
not work alone!

When you get to the eyewash, someone will have to hold your eyes (both of
them, you can't tell which one is affected) open so they can be flushed
properly.  They should be flushed for 15 minutes or until medical help
arrives.

This being said, a proper set of goggles is an absolute must.  Common
&quot;safety goggles&quot; sold at home centers aren't splashproof and you _need_
splashproof goggles.

Also important is protection for your body.  Acid burns may not kill you,
but they will look really bad.

I am appalled by the poor chemical safety practices in the pool industry.
If I was as casual with strong acids as they are I'd be fired, and rightly
so.
