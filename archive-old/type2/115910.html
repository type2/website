I've had my fill of plastic gas cans that leak especially the CA ones that
lack an air passage for quick pouring and leak anyway despite their stupid
leak-proof design.

I started looking for a proper can and found one in the Griot's catalog but
I'm don't want to pay their insane prices so I started looking for a similar
can. I did locate this seller:

http://www.backcountrytrailers_dot_com/Trailers/BackCountry/off-road/gascan.htm

Has anyone bought one lately? I know they are heavy but it will be worth it
if I don't have to deal with spillage.
