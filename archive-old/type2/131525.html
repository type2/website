Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Swap Info?

Hey Mark just make light og the situation. If a lot of people start making 
conversions then possibly there could be a couple of things:

1. The demand for the Type IV engines will go down along with the price.

2. We will only have to contend with the Dune Buggers again.

3. If there is enough people doing it then they can start their own list and 
therefore be directed to it with one email as opposed to a world wide 
discusion about the this.

Instead of the poopy look you could try the, &quot;hey that's great but look at 
my new Jake Raby engine built to perfection with &quot;Hydraulic Lifters&quot;(as I 
said demand is down) and stock FI. Sir I would like to thank you I never 
thought I would be able to buy this engine for less than $1000...out right.&quot;

Just another dream such as many of the hackers ideas.

&gt;From: Mark Hineline 3. I don't have a Tim Duncan game face, so I dread the 
&gt;day that I walk up to someone with just a bus shell in a campground or a 
&gt;7/11 on the road, strike up a conversation, and discover that I am talking 
&gt;to a conversion-driver. I won't be able to conceal that &quot;who stepped in dog 
&gt;****&quot; look on my face.
