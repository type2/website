Brandy,

Ain't this fun! I always use this rule to estimate when I will complete a
project. Take the alotted time from the manuals double it, subtract any time
that you think you will use on sundays because you will break a crucial part
at 8:00 PM on saturday. Add in shipping time from Nepal and you will get a
rough estimate of the minimum time. Oh yeah if you set a &quot;must be done date&quot;
expect to miss it so take precaution.

To answer some of your questions

1. I used a large demolition bar that is like a pry bar but is only a right
angle on the end. I place it resting against a bellhousing stud against the
rotation of the bolt. when you torque on the bolt it will tighten itself.
Sounds confusing but it is easy if you can see it.

2. The fan hub can be removed with a gear puller that uses bolts instead of
arms, they made a cheap version of this tool to remove steering wheels that
might work

3. If the push rod tubes are in good condition and didn't leak re-use them

Good Luck,
Clay
