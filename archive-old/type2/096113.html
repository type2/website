&gt; &gt; &gt; (thoughts of hitting NYC to see the WTC site being delayed
&gt; &gt; take the subway or train into Mannhattan, nearest parking space is New

&gt; I've driven into New York twice in the last six months, both times into
&gt; 
&gt; That being said, we have also used the train (Metro North) to ride into Grand
&gt; Central.  Costs about $30 round trip from West Point/Garrison area (about a 45
&gt; minute ride).  It's a cool ride and you get to relax instead of fighting
&gt; traffic.  I have not experienced Manhattan traffic or parking during normal
&gt; weekday business hours.  Also, consider the height of your bus when looking at

an experience to avoid if you can, 

&gt; parking garages.  If your interested, I can point you towards some web links for
&gt; info on parking garages.

most were too low for my bus

that being said I usually park in Newark and take the PATH train over,
about a $1.50 or so
