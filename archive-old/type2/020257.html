&gt; I have borrowed a 1968  VW DealersipType2  T2(covers 1968 to 1971) Parts
&gt; book. I plan on making some copies this weekend. The manual is printed on A4

Is this the parts-book that only shows parts and no text or partnumbers?
I have three of those catalogs: 1974, 1990 and 1996 edition. For some
reason not available over here at the dealers. I collected them on some
VW-events here in the Netherlands. I scanned all the pages of the
1990-edition and some from 1974, but since it is a bit large in MB's I
have not been able to put it up yet. Plus I am afraid VW won't like it
so I have decided to forget about the idea. Anyone needing any page in
particular, let me know via P-mail:

	molenari_at_dds.nl

I remember reading a link to a scanned T2 manual as well this weekend. I
guess I must have accidentally deleted the message which came from the
Type2-list. The subject of this message had to do with a pipe that
connects to the heater box. Can anyone FWD this URL to me?
