Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Everywhere!!!!

&gt; Two nights ago, I was driving down the road and everything in my bus was
&gt; running fine.  I pulled up to a stop sign, and as I pushed down the clutch
&gt; to put it in first, there was no resistance at all.  I thought maybe the
&gt; clutch cable had snapped but I managed to put it into first.  As I began to
&gt; let out the clutch, though, it was a very rough transition.  The whole bus
&gt; shook violently.  I managed to ease her home and when I inspected things
&gt; last night, I noticed possible problem #2.  There's oil all over the starter
&gt; and flex hose coming out of the heat exchanger and really everything on that
&gt; side of the engine.  I have no idea where it's coming from.  On top of
&gt; things, it started pouring rain on me while I was working on her.

The clutch problem.
I would first pull out the cable and inspect it just to be sure.
If you take off the wingnut you can pull it out through the front without
taking it off the pedal. If its ok just regrease it and push it back in.
If the cable is bad, thats good. If its good thats not so good as it will
probably be the throwout arm or the pressure plate and either is going to
require an engine pull. Wghen you get the engine out it should be pretty
 easy to see  what has gone wrong.

The oil leak.
Could be a valve cover gasket. real easy.
Could be push rod tube seals. not so easy.
Might just be from the road draft tube which is on that side.
Clean it up as good as you can and hopefully you will be able to see the
leak source.

I might do it before I pulled the engine so if its tube seals or even a
push rod tube itself you could do it while the engine is out.

good luck
