Another listee plea for a cheap ride. I know you all are tired of these, but at least I waited 'til Friday. My lease on my borrowed vehicle is almost up and I need to see if I can find a cheap, relatively reliable ride out there. Everything under the sun has kept me from finishing off this engine and putting it in the bus.

All VWs considered. It can look like a pig. It just needs to get me back and forth to work for 2-3 months and needs to be really cheap. I promise when I'm done I'll pass it on it better shape than I got it and for about the same money to some other needy soul. Or if you prefer, I'll give you first option to buy it back.

I work for FedEx in Memphis. I can fly for free anywhere in the country and drive it back. Even West Coast is okay if the vehicle's that trustworthy. Just don't want to be halfway between there and here on the side of the road with a sign that says &quot;Will work for parts.&quot;

Thanks! Joe
