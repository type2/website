Subject: kendall oil..what about head temps?

hey now,

i was discussing the kendall oil phenomenon with stefan today. okay, everyone's
oil is showing lower temps. does anyone who is running this oil have head temp
gauges installed as well? i can believe the oil is cooler but i'm having a hard
time believing that the engine itself is a lot cooler. the heat has to go
somewhere. so...if ya got a head temp gauge and an oil gauge...is the head temp
alot lower as well?
