I will weigh in on the tire thread. I just bought
a set of Michelin 
Agilia Tires C rated tires from my local dealer
here in Toronto....I had spoken with a few
specialty stores when I told them what I 
wanted swore up and down that these tires were
discontinued 

What they were really saying is &quot;we don't have
those on the shelf, and it would be a heck of a
lot easier if I just sell you some of these.&quot;  A
classic example of why you have to know what you
need.  Heck, most of the people who have endured
a tire thread or two on the board know more about
tires than the average idiot behind the counter
at the tire store.
