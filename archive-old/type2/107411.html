Subject: RE: [T2] Re: Cuba

&gt; I have a ton of pics somewhere and, as I recall, most contain 
&gt; pics of old cars.  There are quite a few Mexican beetles 
&gt; around.  There are these little cars that kinda resemble a 
&gt; beetle - in fact, very closely.  I went to look at a few and 
&gt; I think they were Italian - air cooled engine in the back 
&gt; beetle shaped etc.


Probably Fiat 500's. I have one myself. It was Italy's answer to the
Beetle, and stayed in production for something like 25 years. It looks
like a Beetle that got shrunk in the wash, with a big cloth sunroof.
The styling cues from the Beetle are obvious and everywhere.  Has a 2
cylinder 500 cc aircooled engine in the back.
