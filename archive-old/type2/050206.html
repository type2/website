Subject: [T2] Wide 5 wheels ?

Hey Listees,

I have a '68 doublecab with the &quot;wide 5&quot; wheel
type, 14 in.   I like the look of the &quot;chrome&quot;
wheel that I see
offered in the mags by various outfits... the one
that resembles an older style porsche wheel with
the oval holes
around the inside part of the wheel.  this is my
knowlege of them at this point... they are made in
Brazil, the 
&quot;chrome&quot; plating is not very good and is prone to
rust, they are 15&quot; dia. and come in 4 1/2&quot; and 5
1/2&quot; widths.
I have a couple of questions regarding these.  

1.)  Are they crap, i.e. not &quot;true&quot;, poorly mfg'd?

2.)  If not crap, can they be powder coated over
the plating, or can they be found in painted form,
or must they be sand blasted prior to powder
coating.  I am not really into chrome.

3.)  Has anybody run these wheels on a 68 type II
to know whether they will clear the rear wells. 
I'm thinking
with the IRS rear end the camber issue is a
&quot;non-issue&quot;.  Years ago I ran a set of 4 1/2 x 15&quot;
set of early Porsche rims on my '66 bus and with
the swing axle trans vs. the increase diameter,
they ran very close to rubbing against
the rear fender wells but just barely cleared.

I welcome any comments the listees might have
regarding these wheels, if you know the ones I am
speaking of.

Thanks, Chas.
