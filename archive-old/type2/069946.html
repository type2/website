Not to drag out a minor discussion, but this isn't just my opinion.  I am
repeating a fact.  Just ask any mechanic.

The next time you run your motor, feel the alternator.  Better yet, look
at it.  Notice that it is connected to the air-cooling system.  No
combustion happens in the alternator, yet it gets very hot.  Friction.
Friction exists in nearly everything that happens, and contributes a HUGE
amount of heat to everyday life.  Any time something contacts something
else, the temperature of both things rises, due to friction.  It is a
subtle contribution, but it is there.
