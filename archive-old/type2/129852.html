Subject: Re: [T2] Travel to Buy Bus

As I see it, this divides itself into two separate questions. The first 
question is:

If you want to purchase a bus economically and efficiently, does it 
make sense to travel halfway or all the way across the country to buy a 
$1500 bus? The answer is, only in your wildest dreams. Richard Atwell 
was right to be bemused about this.

The second question is:

If you want to purchase a bus and bond with it immediately, draw it up 
into your life while it draws you into its life, does it make sense to 
travel halfway or all the way across the country?

Absolutely, it does.

Last week my wife and I passed a Vanagon Westy for sale in Hungry 
Horse, Montana, near the entrance to Glacier National Park. First time 
we passed it the sign in the windshield said &quot;$800.&quot; Second time it 
said &quot;$600.&quot; Third time it was still $600, but my wife said, &quot;no &amp;^%$# 
way.&quot;

She knew what I was thinking. I was calculating my odds of driving it 
from Hungry Horse to San Diego with a minimum of three breakdowns, only 
one of them catastrophic.
