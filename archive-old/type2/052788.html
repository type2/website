Subject: [T2] 914 tranny -- Thanks!

Hi Folks,

Thanks for all of the prompt and helpful advice!  It's this kind of 
information that makes the list so helpful and valuable.

First, thanks for reminding me about the 914 mid-engine design and the 
&quot;backwards&quot; transmission -- DUH!

Second, it's good to know about the sheet metal mods in addition to the 
tranny mods for both 914 and 911 transmissions.

Third, I didn't even think about the higher load/higher heat related to the 
engine turning more slowly -- a great transmission is nothing with a melted 
engine.

I just recently sold a 1987 Toyota Van which would do 85-90mph on a flat 
road with no headwind (though I did take it up to 100 once down a big hill, 
before realizing how stupid that was...), so I'm kinda used to dealing with 
crosswinds, but you're right that Buses (especially poptop Westies) are more 
susceptible.

But -- and this is the most important point -- the Bus is a different 
vehicle requiring different driver expectations.  I bought mine for all of 
the things my previous cars didn't have: great capacity, great camping 
ability, windows, easy maintenance, the VW cameraderie.  Knowing that, I was 
(consciously or unconsciously) willing to accept the &quot;drawbacks:&quot; lower top 
speed, lesser heat, higher susceptibility to crosswinds.  Thanks for 
reminding me about that.

Once again, thanks for the info that makes owning a VW worthwhile.
