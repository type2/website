Hi all,

Call me dumb, but in all my years of VW-ing, I've never run into this~  My 
engine keeps eating fan belts, that is, the belt itself actually wears down. 
  There's fan belt shavings everywhere in the engine compartment.
Belt tension is good and there doesn't seem to be any rough spots on my 
pulley.  Any ideas?
Thanks,
Scott
