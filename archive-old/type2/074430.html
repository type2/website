&gt; It's official, I'm dangerous. I'm still reading the &quot;Aircooled Engines&quot; 
&gt; book and really loving it.
&gt; 
&gt; Naturally it's raising some questions. I want get a bit of your expertise.
&gt; 
&gt; I was reading about combustion chambers and the author was saying that 
&gt; polished surfaces reflect heat (I knew that) and that keeping heat from 
&gt; soaking into the heads (combustion chamber) is a good thing, I think he was 
&gt; 
&gt; saying it would make more HP this way.

I thought the main reason was to help gas flow, you want to help heat out of 
the engine rather than have it overheat the pistons.&gt;    o... is he saying 
&gt; that a polished combustion chamber and exhaust port 
&gt; would be advantageous and make more HP? Would a coating on the piston help 
&gt; this effect?
&gt; 
&gt; So how polished is good and how much is too much? If you could achieve a 
&gt; polished effect like found on wheels would that be the best you could 
&gt; theoretically hope for? Would it last more than 10 seconds after the first 
&gt; time you started the engine (carbon and basic soot would ruin any polished 
&gt; effect right?)?
&gt; A highly polished finish should help stop carbon building up. some people 
&gt; used to aim for a mirror finish. 
&gt; Finally I know there are different kinds of ceramic coatings that can be 
&gt; applied that would do about the same thing. Has anyone tried this, what 
&gt; sort of cost, durability? Does it ruin the engine's ability to heat the 
&gt; interior of passenger compartment? How good is the horsepower increase? 10 
&gt; HP?
&gt; 
&gt; I suppose that coating the combustion chamber and the pipes inside and out 
&gt; would be good right? Does it help the engine's fuel efficiency? In theory
Here in the UK  one of the latest go faster product is a fibre glass rap to 
go around exhaust pipes to help keep the air coming into the engine cooler 
(cooler air is more dense so gives more power) 
j&gt; ust doing more armchair engineering...  Cheaper that way.
&gt; quite agree
&gt; Love those Tatra engines - amazing engineering!
