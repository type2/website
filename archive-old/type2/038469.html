Subject: Final EGR

I am writing what I hope will be my last EGR valve question regarding an 82 
FI Vanagon.

I started with an aftermarket one piece muffler from the heater boxes back.  
The original crossover pipe &amp; catalytic converter were recovered withe the 
EGR valve connection cut &amp; welded.  After considering the options I had a 
welder attach copper connections to the crossover pipe and what I believe is 
a flange from the EGR filter that was once connected.  I am planning on 
sweating a 15&quot; flexible copper tube from the flange which connects to the 
bottom of the tin &amp; the crossover pipe (pretty much where the EGR filter 
should be).  The welder cut a hole inside where the coupler was welded to 
the crossover pipe so that exhaust gas could pass through as it was 
originally intended.

Could this cause a problem in that exhaust will be passing through without 
first going through any type of filter?

Or should I just close it up somewhere along the line so nothing really 
passes through?

Does anyone know what is in an EGR filter &amp; how it works?

If all goes well with this I will complete state inspection &amp; have a legal 
Vanagon.  Then I can begin a long list of modifications including a possible 
pop top installation. - th
