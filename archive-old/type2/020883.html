Subject: FI Intake manifold hoses

The 4 flexible hoses that come off of the intake air distributor on my
'77 appear to be old and crumbly and I'm wondering if it is worth while
to replace them.  I mean, can I just cut them off and slip new ones on
or is this another big project?  Also, If they are leaking what are the
consequences?  I'm sure that this has been asked before but I couldn't
find the information in the archive.

Thanks,
Ben
