Subject: Has anyone installed a Mexican thermostat on their bus?

I have a Mexican thermostat and bracket but they don't seem to fit on my 
'71.

1. Can the original flap pushrod be used with the Mexican setup or is a 
different pushrod necessary?

2. If anyone has successfully installed one of these, did it just 'bolt 
right in' or were some other steps required? (i.e. did any pieces need 
to be cut, etc.?) What year bus did you install it in?

Thanks in advance,
Bill Moon
