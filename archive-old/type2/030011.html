&gt; I'm still of the opinion that this is bunk...but thats me.;)

Well, the torque required to turn the wheel when the bus is not rolling is
a function of the diameter of the contact patch, the coefficient of
friction, and the contact pressure.

A wider tire will have a lower pressure, but the contact patch will be
larger than a narrow tire.  This means that the lever arm for the outer
part of the contact patch is longer and therefore the torque will be
greater.  Try standing on your heel and twisting your foot sideways.  Then
try the same thing with your weight evenly distributed between your heel
and the ball of your foot.  Heel only twists much easier!

Seeing as how the worm-and-peg gearbox was designed with the _very_ narrow
bias ply tires in mind, it's no wonder that we are seeing failures with
modern rubber installed, and also no wonder that VW went to the
worm-and-roller gearbox after they introduced radial tires on the bus.  I
consider 185s to be pushing it with the early worm-and-peg boxes.  With
the worm-and-roller boxes you can probably get away with wider.  Has
anyond heard of the worm-and-roller box breaking?  I just wish that I
could bolt the late box into my '71!

If you're careful to always be rolling when you turn the wheel, you can
probably get away with just about any tire, but there always seems to be a
situation where you have to turn it at a standstill.
 
&gt; &gt; Low profile tires don't last any longer than conventional tires or carry
&gt; 
&gt; Low profile??  Where?  75 series tire is no where near being low
&gt; profile...a 185R14 and a 195/75R14 are, by the numbers, within a half inch
&gt; overall height difference, if memory serves.

Lower profile than stock, at least.  I measured the 195/75s that I bought,
and the rolling radius was 1/2 inch less than the Bridgestones, which
would be about 1 inch less in diameter.  A small difference, but worth
about 150RPM at cruising speed. 
&gt; 
&gt; Hell, the 195/60HR14's on the quantum arent exactly low profile either..
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe its a case of way to much dry pavement sliding on 155 and 165's in
&gt; my past, for no good reason other then there not being enough contact area
&gt; on the tires...I /dont/ drive easy.

The reason that you needed more contact area was because you were heating
the smaller contact patch.  Hot rubber is slippery.  Wide tires can
dissipate the heat faster so therefore don't get as slick.

The width of the tire has little to do with its traction.  That is
controlled by the rubber compound.  Wide tires tend to have stickier
compounds, since they are &quot;high performance&quot;.  they also tend to wear
faster if driven hard.
 
&gt; Mom can (and does..) run around all day on 165/80R13's with her Jetta...I
&gt; drive the car and wonder when the roads got greasy..

Does Mom know what you are doing in her car?  :)

I also wonder (but certainly don't want to test) the tendency of the bus
to overturn with stickier tires.  The coefficient of friction of painted
metal on asphalt is very low...
