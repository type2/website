Subject: 1983 Vanagon 2.0 aircooled exhaust pipe

Where does one get a stock pipes that connect up between  what I 
think are the heater boxes and the catalytic converter? The parts 
also contain the small pipe that connects to the exhaust gas 
recirculation? I have been told that the parts are discontinued by VW?
 Is this true or is this a bum steer?
