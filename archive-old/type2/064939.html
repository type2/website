FWIW my '64 Ford wil absolutely NOT run until it has idled for about 
10 minutes.  My procedure? Get it started, mess with manual choke, 
and THEN go round up kids, garbage cans, or whatever.  Letting it 
idle and get warmed up can do no harm, right?  The reason we all take 
off right away is that we are impatient, and want to get going.  

Spending the time to let it warm up does no harm, just takes time.
