&gt; That's basically my take on it too, but I think they quit the
&gt; reinforcements on the pop-tops about 74 or so. The original
&gt; provenance(?) of these parts is shown by their part number (I'm an
old 
&gt; parts man) which begins 215 (double door panel).

 Yep, they were used on double sliding door baywindows to stiffen
the bodyshell and on campers with large poptops. Most of the UK
conversions have much bigger cutouts in the roof than the Westy
and I've seen reinforcing panels on a number of them.
 I don't know which converters used them, or if there was some
cutoff at a particular year (as there seems to have been with 
the Westies). I would expect to find them on most Dormobiles,
as they had a close relationship with the factory and a huge
roof cutout (a Dormobile is much more spacious than a Westy).
 FWIW, my '77 Devon has a centre panel but no side ones, my
'68 Dormobile had a full set (I think) and my '71 Westy had a
full set, too (it was a bench seat one, too: no walkthrough,
so must have been pretty stiff...maybe that's why it handled 
so well :-).

Cheers,
