Hello there listees from Scotland.
I have a 1974 Devon conversion which has a pop up roof that sounds 
very like the Hanover roof.  I have been to many van shows and only 
seen one or two of this type on a Devon.  It is a pop up but has a 
tubular steel set up at the front and back that works in a scissor 
like fashion.  On either side there are two roll out bunk beds that 
would take a small adult at a push ;-) These are great for storing 
stuff out of the way when the bed is down!  This sounds very like 
the Hanover conversion.  The more usual Devon conversion has a pop up 
of similar dimensions but with a cantilever type set up down each 
flank.  IMHO the set up on mine is better, the only 
problem is that I cant buy one of those groovy concertina type 
plastic canvas pop up liners.  BTW there is also only one vent which 
is an angled vent which works via a winder type handle.  
PS I`m off to Europe in the van on Friday_at_:-}
Ferry to Amsterdam (];-} from Newcastle then through Holland, 
Belgium and down the West coast of France for some camping among the 
pines behind the beaches:-)))))) Boogie boarding hat on!!!!!!!
