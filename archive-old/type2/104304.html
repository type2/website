Subject: Re: [T2] sliding door on a '78 Westy

From: &lt;Bookwus1_at_aol_dot_com&gt;
&gt; Bentley.  By the way, Bentley will tell you that the entire door has to
come
&gt; off in order to remove and replace the SHLA.  Not so.  And NOT removing
the
&gt; door saves a lot of effort.

Yes, a lot easier if you don't remove the entire door.  Almost closed, the
door will support itself.  Open, I had a short length of a 4&quot; x 4&quot; timber
that held the door up by its bottom edge.

It's also a good time to clean and lube the top and bottom tracks, and the
arms on the door that move in them.
