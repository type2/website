Dont know whether it's available in the US but Beetle Crazy Cup is lots of
fun and you get to drive several buses and single cabs on this it is
published by infograms in the U.K. and has been reboxed as a classic racing
game i.e. much cheaper-Cheers Martin '71 bus '69 bug in li' ole England

&gt; When in K-mart about 2 months ago, I saw a PC racing game that featured VW
&gt; busses as the vehicle of choice. I was poor that day so did not buy it.
Now
&gt; I want one. Anybody know where to get one? I have been back to the store
&gt; several times to no avail. I have tried searches on some game sites and
come
&gt; up empty.
