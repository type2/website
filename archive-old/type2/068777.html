Subject: Face Shield, was Re: Heater stuff

A full face shield is VERY useful in situations where stuff can fall 
into your face.  Plastic shield, adjustable head band.  The kind that 
is usually used for sanding, grinding, etc.  I also used mine when I was 
spraying carb cleaner into the hex heads of CV bolts.  The spray 
frequently splashed back into my face, yuch.  You can find them at 
anyplace that has woodworking equipment.  Worth a few buck to save 
your eyes.  I also wear safety glasses.

&gt; getting under there and dodging all the crap falling into my eyes!
