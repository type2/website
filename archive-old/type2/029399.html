&gt; ===========================&gt;
&gt; Before you throw the box away, what was the part #.
&gt; In looking at the online catalog, I do not see anything that might fit 
&gt; my 1970 buses.

Looking at their website:
http://www.rockfordcv_dot_com/Volkswagen_bootkits.htm
I see that the number is 814-21.

Unfortunately, I'm 400 miles from my old box (if I could find it), so I
can't verify the number.

The only oddities with the boots is that, being a modern design, they are
a bit shorter in length than the accordian-style boots.  The axle has a
pair of &quot;humps&quot; forged into it to retain the small end of the boot, but
the Rockford boot should be positioned just outboard of the outboard
&quot;hump&quot; so as not to stretch the rubber at full extension.

They also use the old style removable CV flange instead of the crimped-on
flange.  If you use a screw-type narrow hose clamp instead of the
supplied one-use clamp here it makes it much easier to relube the CV.
Just loosen the clamp, pull the boot back, and you have a nice size
opening into which to squirt grease.
