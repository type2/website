Doug may be right here.

I have always used a hair dryer and WD-40.

I have used Goof Off, but it was just to very quickly take off some
stubborn sticky that I didn't have time to mess with. Sometimes, WD-40
will take just a few seconds to get the gummy off, and I guess I didn't
have the seconds of patience in me that day. 

The Goof Off was only on for just a second.
Longer; maybe it would have done damage... I don't know.
