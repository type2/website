Subject: Is Santa Cruz, CA The Bus Capitol Of The World?

Hi all..
Took a trip with the family last week to Santa Cruz... first time there...
although we drove the wife's Pontiac... I was amazed to see bus after bus
on almost every street.  Everything from the beat up rusted out old hippie
type hand painted buses to cool custom buses... I saw a bay window.. must
have been a 74 thru 79... that was the Mercedes Bus... It had Mercedes
wheel covers, a big Mercedes logo, must have been off a Mercedes truck on
the nose, and Mercedes identification numbers on the rear panel just under
the window... and... a huge Mercedes steering wheel...  Saw lots of campers
and passenger busses...   My 2 kids enjoyed exclaiming with delight...
&quot;Daddy.. there's another bus!&quot; as we turned almost every corner.  I live in
Los Angeles.. and although I see my fair share of busess... maybe one or
two per day, every day... I have never seen anything like the bus
population in Santa Cruz since the mid to late seventies at Grateful Dead
concerts....    There were people literally living in their buses... parked
at the beach... at lookout points... even on the streets, and in parking
lots...    If you're in California.. and planning a beach summer
vacation... I highly reccomend this town...  A boardwalk with a full 80
ride amusement park is located right on the beach, along with a long drive
on pier, with many restaurants and shops...  not to mention the huge beach
and many cool places to see and hang out.. including the Santa Cruz surfing
museum...   Hopefully, by next summer, my bus will be in good enough shape
to make the trip with us up north...  I'm contemplating a complete front
end rebuild, and a top end rebuild on my 2L engine.  Anyway.. just thought
I'd share my bus watching experience with all...

Thanks...
