&gt; 	The accusation that our motors are mid-1930s design is heard

&gt; essentially misleading because of coure Porsche &amp; VW improved design
&gt; &amp; construction for 4 decades.  (They then lost the plot, resorting to
&gt; water cooling &amp; other blunders.)

By that criteria, just about every engine is a '30s (or earlier) design.
Watercooled inline fours were in common use in the oughts and teens, so
the engine of a Prius is even older than our VWs!
