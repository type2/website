Subject: [T2] Replace a pop-top with a slider?

My roomie has a 74 Westie which he's getting good a mechanicing but he hates
and doesn't use his pop-top.  Has anyone on the list removed one and
replaced it with anything like a sliding roof?  How did or would you do it?
Any and all comments welcome.  Also, if you're in or near Seattle and you
want the top off a 74 Westie, stay tuned:)
