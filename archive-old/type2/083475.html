&gt; &gt; &gt; Why not just cut the body-metal in the lower back of the engine compartment
&gt; &gt; &gt; on both sides (like it is done on split-screen buses).
&gt; &gt; &gt; Then weld some mounting to the cut off-piece and the sides of the engine
&gt; &gt; &gt; compartment, get that rust off and do some painting.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I did this to my '78 2liter.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; This is an excellent idea if you intend to keep the bus for a while.  VW
&gt; &gt; did this themselves with the early bays, so there's no structural reason
&gt; &gt; to keep the panel welded in place.  I think that VW had a
&gt; &gt; significant maintainance philosophy change with the type IV.  The type-1
&gt; &gt; bus was engineered for easy maintainance, while the later buses seem to
&gt; &gt; make the assumption that you will have a lift with which to extract the
&gt; &gt; engine.
&gt;
&gt; Timo, George,
&gt;
&gt; I am sorry to say I have to disagree.  If you have a 1600cc engine, as
&gt; many European buses did, cutting out the rear member will probably not be
&gt; a problem, but I believe that VW welded in the rear skirt on the later
&gt; buses not to make maintainance more difficult, but rather to decrease flex
&gt; under the increased torque of the later, larger T4 engine.

Well, the T-4 does make more torque, but the reaction torque is
transferred to the chassis via a downward force on the rear engine mount,
not a twisting moment.

I don't see much problem in making a structural disconnect on the rear
apron the could handle the incidental twisting load that would be present
there.

It would be a project, though, and probably not worth it unless you pull
the engine a lot.  I prefer to leave the engine in and drive!

George
