Subject: Starting engine questions

OK well since I didn't get many responses to buy my Westy and I was
inspired by a trip to Quebec last week (lots of Westies) I decided to
try and finish the project. I replaced the fuel line that was leaking
and charged it up and secured the wires on my 79 and lo and behold she
cranked and fired, but will only run for about 3 seconds or so before
stalling out. So here are my questions if anyone has answers please
email me!

1) When I rebuilt the engine I used an oversized jug set so it's now
operating as a 2.1L instead of a 2.0. When I bought the set the guy
recommended me using lash caps on the valves. I'm thinking maybe the
valves are opening too much and I should just remove them and adjust the
valves as per VW instructions? Could that be why she isn't running?
2) The idiot who owned my bus before I did put new battery wires in,
but, of course, flipped the colors (red -, black+) last year when I
tried to restart it after the rebuild I hooked them up red to + and
black to - and tried starting it, before I realized my error and fixed
the problem. Could this have caused damage to the computer or something
else in the FI?
3) I do not have the exhaust manifolds connected. Lack of back pressure
shouldn't be a problem right?
4) I have removed the EGR valve and blocked off the inlet on the FI with
a plate and gasket so it won't suck air. This is the right way to remove
the EGR right? I didn't need to adjust anything else?
5) Any other suggestions for me to check? I never removed the
distributor so the timing shouldn't have changed (right?). I have spark
and compression. I'm getting gas since it is firing. The gas is new,
battery is charged and giving 700 cca. The engine ran but leaked
terribly before the rebuild.

Thanks in advance for advice.
