Subject: Re: [T2] Re:safe temp for 1600

Hi Paul,

I think those figures are the generaly accepted ones - certainly they have been 'kicking around' for the 12 years I have had a Type 2.

Do remember that cooling the engine of means driving slower (without changing down) so that the ratio of air moved to engine speed increases. In extreem circumstances eg just come up a long steep hill in hot conditions cooling the engine down may mean puling over to the side and letting it idle for a few minutes as cooling:heating ration is at a maximum when idling.

Good luck

&gt; 
&gt; I recently bought a 1600 from Bob Donalds of Boston Engine.  He
&gt; suggested using the dipstick sender that gets wired to the oil
&gt; pressure light. When the temperature reaches about 225F, your oil
&gt; light flickers. Hotter temperature turns the light on steady.  When
&gt; that happens it's time to cool the engine off, before you overheat it.
