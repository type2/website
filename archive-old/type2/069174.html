In the event that this isn't a geometry problem but simply a faulty pushrod
problem, I am relating my one experience with cheapo nonVW pushrods (which
was bad).  I'm not talking about chrome-moly or steel pushrods, just cheap
aluminum reproductions similar to the original VW pushrods.

When I originally installed my current engine 5 years ago, I decided getting
new pushrods would be a good thing even though rolling the original VW rods
on the table revealed they were not bent and there were no shiny spots on
the shafts from rubbing against the pushrod tubes.  I went to a local
foreign auto parts place and purchased new nonVW pushrods for $2 each (these
were aluminum tubes with what appeared to be a hardened tips on the ends,
similar to the originals).  Only after one of the pushrod ends failed within
the first few thousand miles did I notice that the hardened piece was not
securely attatched to the aluminum tube (the tube part of the pushrod had
torn where it joined with the tip). 

I swapped the original tubes back in and have no problems for 70k miles.  I
now save the good pushrods when I part out an engine!  Good luck with your
new engine--I hope this was caught in time so no damage was done.
