&gt; I don't have my bentley at home this weekend as I forgot it at  
&gt; work, which is
&gt; over an hour away!  I'm trying to remember how to test whether the  
&gt; oxygen
&gt; sensor is giving a reading or not.  From vague memory it creates a  
&gt; voltage of
&gt; 0 to 1v does it not?

It constantly swings between 0.2 to 0.8V or so.

&gt; 79 cali bus the oxy light just came on, and i noticed a
&gt; drop in mileage.

The light comes on automatically. The reset button is behind the kick  
panel.

&gt; pretty sure it is the oxy sensor but would like to verify
&gt; before going and spending the $70,  any tips to lead me in the  
&gt; right direction
&gt; would be apreciated.  thanks

Seems pricey for such a simple sensor. Your cost should be $20-30.  
Search for these Bosch numbers:

0 258 001 025
11027
