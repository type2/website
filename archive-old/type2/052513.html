&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; I went to the junkyard today and picked up a beautiful looking
&gt; &quot;Hoover Bit&quot;.  Zero rust and not bent at all.  It was almost like
&gt; finding the Holy Grail.  Now, I made one after following D. 
&gt; Mueller's excellent article on Van Ness's page so I don't really
&gt; need it but it was exciting to find just the same!  I think I'll
&gt; hang it from the Westy's rear view mirrior. :) 
&gt; 
&gt; On the same car(73 bug) I picked up the blower housing, flaps w/
&gt; connecting rod, exit ducting for a doghouse set up AND the intake
&gt; manifold from (i think) a 71 bus.  It has the 1/2&quot; outlet for the
&gt; vac booster tube and a 211 part number.  I forgot my big socket
&gt; so I couldn't get the fan. :(
&gt; 
&gt; There was also a Ghia with an engine case that said &quot;Hencho en 
&gt; Mexico&quot; in the rear right under the distributor.  Is this one of
&gt; those mexibeetle engines?  It was a goldish(cosmoline?) color and
&gt; turned easily.  Heads 'looked' ok too.  Thought about picking it
&gt; up.  Maybe for that 1776.........................
&gt; 
&gt; Take care.
