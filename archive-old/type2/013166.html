Subject: Netvergnugen makes the J. Garcia/BBC segment

On the 5 yr anniversary of Jerry's death, the BBC was talking to folks 
about Jerry and such. I managed to make it into the show for a whopping 
15 seconds or so, and better yet I was wearing my Netvergnugen shirt (w/ 
the old Vanagon_at_lenti address). I posted a screen shot of me in the 
shirt, a short clip of just my portion, and the whole 15 minute segment 
for those w/fat bandwidth. In the full segment there's quite a few busses 
scattered about, and even a short segment about a bus named Althea, 
w/600k miles on it from touring. Kinda cool. 

And I made the Friday cutoff with only 15 minutes to spare (takes a while 
for my poor old 'puter to digitize 15 minutes of video)...
