Subject: Re: [T2] vw pics and vwoa license

&gt; &quot;Licensee is also permitted to display images of Volkswagen Vehicles,
&gt; provided those images were not taken from the official Volkswagen website,
&gt; www.vw_dot_com, or other Volkswagen copyrighted documentation.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; So, does this mean that I m not permitted to show pics of any of my
&gt; vw vehicles unless I sign this agreement?....I don't think so...I &quot;own&quot;
&gt; those cars, I don't license them from vw like software.  And should be
&gt; able to display pics of them anywhere I want ....and give others
&gt; permission to do the same.

This all sounds entirely reasonable to me, and all they are saying is that
you have to provide your own photos.. don't use ones from their site,
brochures, etc. They have a right to exclusive commercial use of their own
works anyway, under copyright law, so this goes without saying. Of course,
let us not forget something else.. Under the so-called &quot;Fair Use Doctrine&quot;
(look it up at Cornell_dot_edu), you can reproduce excerpts of anything
protected by copyright law, to the extent that this doctrine and pursuant
judgements allow, in a non-commercial environment only. This generally
pertains to educational and informative sites, but does not allow you to
reproduce works in their entirety, so far as I know. Here a test of
&quot;reasonableness&quot; would probably come into play. So, my question is this.. If
one can invoke the &quot;Fair Use Doctrine&quot;, then why would anyone sign a
specific agreement with VWOA or VWAG, leaving them potentially open to
breach of contract suits? Jan B
