Subject: Starts right up and then stalls (problem solved)

My gal is up and running again! Yahooo! 
I found that I was not getting power to my injectors, so I began tracking the problem per Bentley which led me to the double relay. While going through the steps outlined, I checked between terminal 85 and 88d and hit the starter - it started right up and ran fine! All I can figure is that I had a poor connection at the double relay and when jostling it around and pushing on individual terminals, I must have cleaned it up. (does this make sense?) Anyway, I'm thrilled to have her running again and I want to thank everyone for their help. 
Peace

after changing my clutch cable, I went to start my bus and it started right away and then died within 1 or 2 seconds. This happens over and over. I tripple-checked all vacume hoses (especially the one to the brake booster in the area where I was working) and everything is in place. I also confirmed that there was gas in the tank (you never know sometimes). I thought for sure it was a vacume leak and was chomping at the bit to get home from work and fix it, but now I'm totally bummed. Does anyone have an idea where to look next?
