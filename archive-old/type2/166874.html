Subject: Resurrecting, continued

Is it possible that the starter is not fully engaging the flywheel? It sounds like the starter is turning, because it is MUCH more noise than just a solenoid &quot;click&quot;. As I mentioned before, it sounds like a muffled machine gun. I used the Marvel Mystery Oil as recommended (Thanks Eddie) in the spark plug holes. There is still resistance, actually a little more than I would expect. It almost sounds like the starter pinion is not coming out far enough to engage the flywheel. When I installed the bushing for the starter I put it where it is flush with the face of the metal it was put into. Does it need to be inset at all? It seems like the old one was flush, just like the new one. I inspected the flywheel before putting the starter in and even if I missed a spot, the fact that I have been turning it manually should eliminate the flat spot scenario. I am afraid I still may not be pulling enough volts / amps to get this baby turning. OR since I still can't turn the fan by hand (using a prybar), do I need to continue to lube and turn, lube and turn until it moves more freely?

I appreciate y'all's advice more than I can say. Soon, I will become an advice giver rather than the newbie.? Am I allowed to put?the address?to my family website on here to show the before pics, If anyone is interested? (there are no ads or link or anything)


Down in Dallas,
