&gt;  I was wanting to know what the difference is between the Bus engine and
&gt;the Vanagon engine is.
&gt;case has a different breather set-up on top of the case, but what else is
&gt;different? I know they all have hyd lifters, they are all FI, but are the
&gt;heads the same?

same as 79 bus, square exhaust ports, and the exhaust that matches...
 What about the crank, rods, pistons? I bet they are the
&gt;same.

close enough for government work, SSgt Scott...

I dont care about any of the external stuff like FI, intake manifolds,
&gt;etc. Just the long block. Basicly could I get a good Vanagon engine and
&gt;stuff all the guts into a good Bus case?

sure thing....

 Or could I drop a Vanagon
&gt;engine(use carb and Bus exhaust) into a Bus?


i like the motor mounts. you may have to back-date these...
get the vanagon exhaust. i also like the vanagon alternator for
the ease of belt changes, and so down to the sheet metal, you
can probably use a little of each and custom fit the whole deal...
looks sweet with a pair of dual carburetors on top...
not sure about the oil filler tube/ combined with the fan housing
and the clearance fit in your bus, but you could use the old set...
