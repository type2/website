Subject: Re: [T2] Bay-window belly pan

&gt; Can anyone tell if all the bay-windows came with belly pans or was that
just
&gt; on the split-windows? Mine doesnt have one and I don't know if it had one
at
&gt; one time and just fell off or what. When doing resto's do a lot of people
&gt; bother with the belly pan ?

Are you meaning the front pedal pan?
Or the belly pans that are mounted to the frame under the middle of the bus?
I have seen belly pans on early bay sunroof buses.
As far as I know and have seen, the pedal pan came on every bus. Some are
long gone, but the outline in the undercoating and the screw holes are still
there.
