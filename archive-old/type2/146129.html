If the original hole has stripped you can have it helicoil repaired.

&gt; if i can't get the plug back in and i

&gt; up to it somehow?  does anything ever go as planned when working on  
&gt; these
&gt; things, or do i need to adjust the plan to make that happen?

How far do you have to go?

The easiest thing to do is to use a tow truck that can lift up the  
rear by the wheels hydraulically and then secure the steering wheel  
with some rope.
