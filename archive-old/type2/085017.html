&gt; Take a piece of rubber fuel line hose and slide it over the porcelin of the 
&gt; &gt; plug.  Make sure it grips tightly!  Then you can use the small amount of 
&gt; &gt; room left in the tin hole to work the hose around until you get the right 
&gt; &gt; angle.  Thread it in as far as you can before you put a plug socket and a 
&gt; &gt; swivel+extension on it to snug it up.
&gt; &gt; I've been there!
