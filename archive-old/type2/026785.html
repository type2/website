Dave, and everyone else too,

   &quot; It all started a couple of weeks ago when I was taking my daughter to a 
concert.  Pushed the clutch in, there was a faint 'ping' and the pedal felt 
looser than before.  The following day I had a job interview and just as I 
started off, there was another 'ping', now it was getting hard to change 
gear.  I drove the 60 miles to the interview thinking &quot;why me?&quot;, &quot;today of 
all days&quot; etc, tightened the clutch in the car park of the hotel where the 
interview was (in my best clothes of course).&quot;
   Once a year I remove the clutch and accelerator cables for inspection, 
greasing, and replacement if needed.  That way I get to decide where and 
when I have to deal with them.  And of course I have spares on board, just 
in case.
