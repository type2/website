&gt;We finally got our 76 Westy on the road after a slew of problems. As of this
&gt;week end, we've been camping in it 4 times. I've scanned different web pages
&gt;for suggested items to take/pack, so I have most of those things down pretty
&gt;well. We are keeping a list of little things we need.
&gt;What I'd like to hear about are ways you all keep your camper organized
&gt;while camping- We're getting good at putting stuff right away, but there has
&gt;to be more to keeping things organized.
&gt;What kinds of containers do you use for wet/dirty clothes, where do you put
&gt;the table at night, what do you keep in the overhead compartment (we have a
&gt;couple board games in there which take up space, and we have the front
&gt;curtains and rear screen), what do you keep in below the bench seat?
&gt;
&gt;How about mosquitos? We have the rear screen, and I know a sliding door
&gt;screen is available, but it's a little pricey if I recall correctly . Have
&gt;any of you thrifty people come up with a cheaper alternative? How about the
&gt;front windows?
&gt;
&gt;Outside. We have a largish pavillion type of thing with a roof and no sides
&gt;which folds up nicely. It's nice for sunny days, however, it's worthless in
&gt;the rain. The rain splashes in, and if we set it up right outside the
&gt;sliding door the rain pours off the roof and gets the inside of the open
&gt;door wet- I know, close the door, but it's nice to have it open. I'm going
&gt;to get a tarp to bridge the gap- any other cheap alternatives?
&gt;
&gt;Rain- what do you all do in the rain? We have a mat outside the door, and we
&gt;have to take our shoes off to keep the inside clean/dry. Any suggestions for
&gt;camping in the rain? PA has had an exceptionally wet summer this year.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Sorry for the long post. Thanks for any tips.
&gt;Anyone near Erie, PA want to hook up and camp?
&gt;
&gt;
