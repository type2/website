&gt; Hello listees,
&gt; 
&gt; I am following the Bentley instructions on adjusting my 34pict3
&gt; carb and on step 6 it says to turn the idle mixture screw(small
&gt; screw on the left of the carb body) to obtain the fastest possible
&gt; idle...then your supposed to turn idle mixture adjusting screw
&gt; clockwise (closing) until engine speed drops 20-30 rpm's.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, when I turn the mixture screw the idle speed doesn't vary.
&gt; With the rpm's at about 900 I can turn the mixture screw all the
&gt; way in and almost all the way out with zero variation in engine
&gt; speed.  I have a tach/dwell meter to verify this.  What can this
&gt; mean??
&gt; 
&gt; I would have thought that with the mixture screw seated
&gt; the engine would die from lack of fuel.
&gt; 
&gt; Also,  the carb won't hold a steady idle, it lopes from about 850
&gt; to 1000 rpm's and occasionally saunters  up to 1400, 1500 rpm's.
&gt; What's up with that??  Vacumme leak?

My suspect is a worn throttle shaft that lets air past.  A (very)
temporary fix for this is to take the nuts off of both sides and put some
thick grease (like Bosch distributor point grease) where the shaft enters
the carb body.  If the carb tunes better you might be able to get it past
smog before the grease goes away.

The real fix is a new carb or having the old carb rebushed.

The -2 and -3 carbs are a lot more susceptable to being dirty than the -1
versions.  A good cleaning will often cure their ills.
