&gt; As I understand it, the real risk you take jump-starting an FI bus
is frying the Control Unit (Computer) of the system.

There is a very simple way to avoid this danger.

First, be sure to turn off the engine of the car doing the jumping. 
If the voltage regulator of the car doing the jumping is set higher
than the car being jumped, alternator damage may result.

Second, be _totally_ sure that you are hooking up the jumper cables
correctly.  Make sure that the black cables are connected to the
chassis of their respective vehicles, not the battery terminals.

If you follow these two simple guidelines, the bus being jumped cannot
tell the difference between its own dead battery and the battery
attached via jumper cables.
