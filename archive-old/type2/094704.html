Subject: Re: [T2] Speaking of Mexico (was RE: [T2] Used Mexican Bus?)

Dont know about car parts but many years ago i used to pack 50 lb bags 
of sugar back to a baker friend on the us side of the border from 
mexico.  This was back in the sugar embargo days and us sugar 
skyrocketing out of range.  You have to call customs and ask what the 
tariff points are.  some items bring back 6, the next item might be 0.  
With the sugar I could bring back one bag per day.  Note we have a 
customer at the flaps i work at the comes in for fancy rims to put on 
his truck.  he makes one delivery/pickup run per week for his brothers 
business.  He sells the rims in mexico, and comes back on basic rims.

&gt; This thread on Mexi-buses reminded me of a question
&gt; I've been meaning to ask:  If I were to go to Mexico, would
&gt; I have any problem coming back into the US with a small truckload
&gt; of things like new cylinder heads, P/Cs, rods, etc...?
&gt;
&gt; Also, I assume these things are available at Mexican parts houses, what
&gt; types of prices could I expect?  Would it be worth the trip/trouble?
&gt; Thanks,
