&lt;&lt; is there any way to tell if an engine leaks oil, when
it is out pof the vehicle. i have a 79 engine that i
bought from a &quot;salvageyard&quot; i want to rebuff it and
use it but i want to determine if it leaks oil or not.
can i just pour oil into the crankcase, come back in a
wekk or so and look at the floor beneath? will this
metheod return accurate info?

I know on some of my other engines there are ways 
of spinning the oil pump without running the engine
to bring up the oil pressure...I'd guess that a 1/2
inch drill, chucked up with the correct fan bolt
socket could spin the engine enough to check for
leaks???
Pull the plugs and remove the fan belt to make it 
as easy as possible on the drill ?
Like I said, that's just a guess...
