Subject: Mercedes wheel application - I've got it...

I think I have finally been able to figure out the Mercedes wheel list for=
=20
our VW vans.

Tire has a .pdf file that lists steel wheels for most applications.

Here is what they list for us:

190D,E			1984-1993	15x6.5 		5-112		37mm offset		$31.35
300E, CE, TE	(124 series)	1985-1995	15x6.5		5-112		37mm offset		$31.35
C220, C230, C280		1994-2000	15x6.5		5-122		37mm offset		$31.35
						16x7.5		5-112		41mm offset		$39.90
CLK320, CLK400		1995-2000	16x7.5		5-112		41mm offset		$39.90
E320,E300D			1995-2000	16x7.5		5-112		41mm	offset		$39.90

Okay what I see is two wheels spanning the entire Mercedes Brand. These are=
=20
steel wheels but should give us an idea of what we need if we start looking=
=20
for aluminum wheels.

I can tell you from experience that Tire Rack will not answer questions=20
about the Mercedes wheels on a VW. I think it is a question of liability,=20
mail order charges if they do not fit, and so on. They don=92t know if they=
=20
will fit, don=92t know if they are strong enough, and they don=92t wanna pay=
=20
for the shipping or deal with a mad client that says they promised these=20
wheels would fit.

I do think they would fit because I think the VW bus needs are 35-37 mm=20
offset anyhow right? The 16=94 wheels have a bit different offset though b/c=
=20
(I THINK) of the added width and Mercedes tried to keep some of the extra=20
width under the fender (????).

The Audi offsets are all 40mm+ which would require a spacer to be used as=20
well. I like using less hardware to keep my wheels on and positioned....=
 &lt;grin&gt;

This would help identify which applications are closest to our bus needs.=20
Much cheaper than the VW catalog prices that I have seen at different sites=
=20
on the Internet. Seems like I remember some high prices!!! Using this same=
=20
information we could also purchase aluminum wheels listed for the Mercedes.

As far as the weight capacity of the wheels  what do you think?? -  the=20
Mercedes is a heavy car and these are the same wheels as found on Mercedes=
=20
station wagons that they used to advertise had a higher load capacity than=
=20
a Jeep Cherokee=85.

I hope this helps anyone scratching their heads about Mercedes wheels. I=20
would be happy to send this application chart (.pdf file) via e-mail or ICQ=
=20
file transfer to anyone that wants it. It came from somewhere on the Tire=20
Rack site. I don=92t have the address anymore.
Ciao!
