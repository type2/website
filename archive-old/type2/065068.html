Subject: your article wasn't published...

hey now,

i'm sorry the article didn't run. i wouldn't have seen it anyways cuz i don't
read that fine peace of literature. :-)

but having worked for a newspaper and having put in alot of work for stories
which editors seemed interested in, i know that most of mine didn't run. it
does suck working, researching, interviewing on a story that you *were told*
would run.

however, that's the publishing business. sometimes your stories run, sometimes
they don't. even when you are told they will.

ya just gotta move on.
