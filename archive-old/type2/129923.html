Subject: Re: [T2] knuckle slammer shifter

...

Little bit of wear at the coupler is a lot of movement at the shifter. New 
shifter plates are cheap. If yours shows wear replace it. For initial 
adjustment, engage 2nd gear, adjust plate so shifter lower shaft is 
perpendicular to the floor. Now test shifting. If you still hit the e-brake 
handle, shift the plate rearward bit by bit. Just a small movement at that 
plate is 2&quot; or more of knob movement.

&gt;shows it is mildly wollowed out and worn, so i'll change it now. but is
&gt;there more to be done to avoid hitting the e-brake and such when shiting
&gt;into third?
