Gee, could we define a bus gathering as a &quot;neo traditional development&quot;?

&gt; I have one question though of my Oregon compatriots.  Your gas station laws
&gt; seem to me to be rather odd.  I love your state and you are very freindly
&gt; people but I have to ask why you put up with this.  You can't pump your own
&gt; gas at a service station in Oregon.

I've heard various explanations for this, but it boils down to the fact
that the bigwigs don't want to pump their own gas or pay more than someone
else to have it done.

It doesn't bother me all that much, as my '71 has a huge filler opening
that they can't miss, but they still manage to give the side of the bus a
liberal gas-rinse.  If I had a later bay I would be very uptight with
their fragile rubber filler pipes.  I used to ride a motorcycle while
travelling and found the gas attendent most accommodating.  They would
turn on the pump and hand me the nozzle in most cases.  

Oddly enough, when I travelled through Oregon this summer, the gas prices
went _up_ as I left the state into California.  Alturas was at least 10
cents higher for self-serve, and prices stayed high until I got to Chico.
