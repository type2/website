&gt;What I 
&gt;would like to know is if there is a way to power the AC outlet 
from the 
&gt;battery through an inverter while in motion or not connected to a 
campsite 
&gt;power supply, but to have it switch over automatically (or maybe 
just a 
&gt;light switch, though that=92s kind of lame looking) when the bus is 
plugged 
&gt;into the power supply.  Is any of this stuff possible?

Yes it is.  My refrigerator does this - I can leave it hooked up 
to 12V and when 110V is present, it triggers a relay (I think) and 
runs off of 110V.  I haven't bothered to wire the inverter up that 
way though - I just have a separate outlet for it and since 
nothing stays permanently plugged in, I just plug stuff into 
whichever outlet has power at the time.  Lame I know, but it works 
for me.
&gt;
&gt;I 
&gt;have heard that the gas heaters were not really meant to be run 
for too long 
&gt;without the bus running, because they can suck down a battery 
pretty quick, 
&gt;is that true?   

Yes, the blowers take a lot of electricity.
What about 
&gt;vent-less heaters, such as a Coleman Catalytic heater, or a small 
kerosene 
&gt;heater?  Would that be safe to use in a minimally vented bus?

Don't use anything that's not externally vented unless you like 
condensation, headaches, and possibly even dying an early death.
