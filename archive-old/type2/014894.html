Greg,

It all depends on what kind of work you need to get done.  I could 
probably tell you the mechanics to avoid easier than the ones to go 
to.  Ha-ha!

On one end of the spectrum, if it is just simple things, I can show you 
how to do it yourself, if you don't mind getting a little grease under 
your fingernails.  If, on the other hand, you need yout transmission 
rebuilt, I can tell you who to take it to.
