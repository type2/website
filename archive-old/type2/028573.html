Importance: Normal

First pic:  Isn't that the switch to tell you the handbrake isn't fully
released?

Second pic:  As for the resistor/no resistor issue, I suspect the resistor
is now placed inside the switch, the bulb has a lower wattage than the older
switch, or the bulb will glow brighter than VW intended when the system was
designed...Not a big deal in any event.
