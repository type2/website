&gt; Really late last night I broke down on the side of the road.
I feel for you man!!
&gt; My bus had been sitting for about a month and the gas tank had been pretty
&gt; low.
&gt; Plus we had some snow and ice during that time.

I would suggest some fresh gas &amp; some fuel line antifreeze initially,
especially since you had an almost empty gas tank sitting around with
fluctuating temperatures.  Couldn't hurt.
