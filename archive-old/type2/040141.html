Subject: Camping at Pontiac Lakes for the Auburn Hills show; any left?

In case I get a case of the great outdoors, does anyone know if the
campground will likely fill up?  Normally I'd say it would not be likely
this time of year, but with the show and the proximity to Detroit and the
suburbs...  maybe so.

I'm bringing name stickers for you extrovert types.  They have the type2 web
page splitty around the border, with room for a short name.  I'll be leaving
my last name off, and you Alexandrias and Dominiques will have to be
creative.

Name tag or no, stop by and say hi, put a face to a name.  Just look for
Chris Huff's purple balloons.
