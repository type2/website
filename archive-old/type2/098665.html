Subject: It is almost Friday, just a rambling update

Hello List,

I am almost ready to install my 914 engine. I am
finishing up sealing the 72-74 style heat exchangers
with POR 15 fire seal 2000 today. Once that is cured,
I will give them a final coat of POR 15 manifold grey.
Once I make sure that the ports on them are true using
a flat, long file, I will install them with new copper
gaskets. I then have a few small odds and ends of the
FI and EGR to hook up and It will be ready to install.

I finished up the engine compartment a weak ago. I had
to remove the old gas tank to replace it with a FI
one. While I had it out, I painted my sealed engine
compartment with POR 15 paint and then top coated it
with Whitecote. I used some grey spray paint to
repaint the gas tank cover plate. I replaced the
Ground cable for the battery (the old strap resembled
a wad of hair pulled from a shower drain)with a 14&quot;  1
Gauge, heavy duty, cable. Aside from cutting a hole to
install the FI computer and mounting the fuel pump, I
think the compartment is ready. Oh, I did replace all
of the fuel lines while I was in there.

Any how, this post is more like a page full of
rambling sentences than an update. IT helps me
remember what I have left to do. Any way, thanks for
reading!

Have a great day!

David Kelly

P.S. I could have made this post interesting with
pictures but for some reason my USB port seems to be
dead or just on strike. Oh Well,
