Subject: Re: [T2] DMV woes....

i know when i bought my riviera camper here in
nebraska, the PO had RV plates on it.  i registered it
however in NY and they didnt have a problem giving me
regular car plates for it.  when i filled out my
paperwork i just listed it as a 1973 volkswagen van.  
so it might just depend on who you talk to at the DMV.
 id go try again.  funny how if i remember correctly a
few months ago we were having the exact opposite
conversation since someone wanted to get RV plates but
the DMV was hassling them:)  it seems you just can't
win for losing with those people.  good luck.
