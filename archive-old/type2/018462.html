Subject: And the survey says...
Message-ID: &lt;3761EB78.FBB4D7FA_at_eoni_dot_com&gt;

Last Friday I asked you all to send me the type of &quot;platform&quot; or computer that
you uesd.  Here's how it turned out...

Users:

PC:     21
Mac:    18
Other:   8

Seems that VW bus drivers DO &quot;Think Different&quot;.  Here's a bit more...

Number of systems reported (Note, I tried to include ONLY active systems, not
the ones that were reported to be sitting in a closet somewhere.):

PC:     25
Mac:    26
Other:  16

That works out to 1.191 PCs per user, 1.444 Macs per user and 2.000 &quot;others&quot;
per user.

The &quot;others&quot; included: 3 Linux boxes, a few Ataris(?), an HP, a Victor and
(best of all) a Sun Workstation.

Interestingly, many folks who responded listed their PCs entire setup, while
most Mac users responded with &quot;Mac&quot;.  Also, I notice that Mac users tend to
have a &quot;collection&quot; of 'em, while PC users seem to have one reasonably
complete system. (I did the same survey on the Vanagon list and that tendency
was apparent there too.)

Speaking of the Vanagon survey, I found that many folks missed the original
announcement and responded the next week.  Because of this, I'll gather data
for another week and we'll see if the data changes.

So... If you missed the first post, here's what you gotta do;  send me the
type of computer (platform) that you're sitting in front of. 
mailto:jrasite_at_eoni_dot_com  Don't send it to the list, just me.  I'll collate the
data and post the results next Friday.
