Subject: Time for a New Exhaust

--part1_32.23c306cb.29c4271f_boundary

Well the first thing that I want to change on my Van is going to be the 
exhaust. I was wondering what is the best sounding, and good for the money 
exhaust for my 1970 westy? Please lend a hand.......

Thanks,
Rustin (1970 Westy)
