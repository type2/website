I just wanted to take the time to thank those on the list who took the time
to help me sort through my exhaust issues/cost.  I did end up getting the
heater boxes for cheaper than I had planned, so that helped me cut some
corners.  Running smooth now, I can hardly believe how quiet she is now.
balls joints, tires, shocks, tranny, engine rebuild, exhaust
rebuild.....hmmmm...maybe brakes now!  why not!
To those who asked why I would sell the bus if I love her&gt; sometimes it is a
love hate relationship.  it is much easier for me to get down on the ol bus
when it is so darn cold out side..(MA)....and Im walking everywhere..my
girlfriend sees it as unreliable..notions that I may be to poor to keep the
thing on the road...I only have one very tight parking spot, no room to work
on my bus.......but......you know what.....I got it back from my mechanic a
couple of days ago, fired it up after 3 months, drove her down the road  and
said, well, maybe ill keep it a little longer, maybe just a paint job in the
spring....!  'cause, after all...I do love 'er.  I may just be hooked.
