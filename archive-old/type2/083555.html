Subject: slider roof seals

&lt;snip&gt;
Another reason for the silicone fix is the 
seal that is used to do this job. Its made of FELT!
Yes, felt, and they are VERY expensive.
&lt;/snip&gt;
All of the above is true except.... the felt is
there not as a seal. The sunroof is designed to drain
down 4 drains.. two in front an two in back. The felt
is not there to seal against water but to take up the
space and prevent the wind from forcing the water over
the lip an into the bus. they designed it to allow the
water to enter and the just drain.
 All the other info in the post was excellent and 
informative.. thanks... sunroofs are the great mystery.
