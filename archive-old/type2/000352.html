This has been one of the best day's I have ever had working on my bus. Ever
had a day where every tool you drop lands just out of reach. You know the
kind, where the wire is just 1 inch to short or the bolt not quite long
enough.

I started with all running lights in the rear disconnected, the dash out
with wires hanging, new turn signal switch installed but not tested. When I
hooked everything up (about 4 hrs.),including running a 4ga. wire from the
battery area to a fuse block under the dash. I also re-grommeted all the
holes the wires passed through on their journey. Tom, whose garage I work
in, connected the negative terminal of the battery and I looked for the
direction the smoke was coming from. No smoke. EVERYTHING WORKED except for
a turn-signal indicator light, a loose back-up light bulb  ,and a loose wire
on the brake-check light switch. From the DPO I have a solid gray wire that
is hot when the key is off  and off when the key is on. Anyone know where it
goes?

The only problem is the front turn signals blink very dimly. Any one got any
suggestions?

The rest of the day was spent installing the bumper over-riders and bumpers.
Needed one slightly longer bolt to finish. Opened a can of misc. nuts,
bolts, etc. that Tom S. had given at some show and right on the top was the
perfect size. It's been that kind of a day.

Hope yours was better........................(More to come)

Don't take life too seriously- you'll never live through it.
