&gt; I've been perusing the archives about synthetic oil, trying to decide if

&gt; So my questions are: Should I use synthetic oil? If so what brand Weight 
&gt; 5-50? Frequency of oil changes?

to start something that will become a FART I know but to respond with my
own experience

Yes I run synthetic.
No don't run Synthetic durning breakin of new engine

I run Penzoil Performax 5W-50 year round.

I have not noticed any difference in oil presure or temp over a quality
dino oil

I still change my oil every 3,000 (give or take) but don't get upset if I
miss the target  occasionally by a 1,000 miles or so.

I mainly chose the synthetic for ease in starting in the winter, I ski and
get to some pretty cold places.  

it is more expensive but I consider it cheap insurance (on a newly rebuilt
engine)

the stuff will leak out of any little hole, so the engine MUST be tight,
however I have found that it is not that hard to keep it tight, I rarely
have to add oil between changes

I have oil temp and presure guages, and have monitored my conditions

I drive in very severe conditions most times, city stop and go, then long
hauls to ski in bitter cold weather, I think the synthetic helps hold the
&quot;gunk&quot; in suspension to be gotten by the oil filter

hope this helps
