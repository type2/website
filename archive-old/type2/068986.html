Start with the ignition stuff because it needs to be in good shape anyway.
But the fact that it starts OK but cuts out after a few minutes (when it
gets warm?) suggests FI problems, like maybe a bad temperature sensor.

If you have an ohm meter, check out the readings on temperature sensor
#2 (the one in the head, front left) when it's cold and when it's hot.
At least check to see that it's tight in the head, the wire's not loose,
etc.
