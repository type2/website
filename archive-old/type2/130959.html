Subject: FS 71 Westy Nashville wrecked...

Listees:

This is NOT the bus I just got last weekend, this is a different 71 Westy I 
found in west Nashville. Looks to be in excellent shape minus being rear 
ended. The bumper took some of it but corners and engine lid took the 
majority of  the hit. I looked underneath and the rails looked ok but I 
didn't really get under there and really inspect it. Best case you would 
have to totally to both entire corners and get a new deck lid/apron. Worst 
case it would be massive massive surgury.

Was orginally white and was repainted white, looks like a crappy maaco job, 
some chipping but of course the whole bus would have to be painted after the 
body work. Got a little crunch in the front but it's hardley noticable 
especially compared to the rear.

Engine supposedly has 1000K on a full rebuild but I wonder if the wreck 
could have totally messed it up. Interior is really really really nice. 
Front seats look original and in excellent shape. Has fancy guage cluster. 
Camper stuff looked complete and great from what I saw. Not sure if it would 
make more sense to do major surgery and fix it, or just part it out. Guy 
wants 1500 which I think it steep considering the body damage.

If anyone wants to buy and part it out, let me know b/c there's some parts I 
would love to get, especially the front seats. Also I will assist in anyway 
with a sale, take pics if I need to, compression check - whatever. Owners 
number is 615.485.2472.
