&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Looking at 185's vs. 195's on Tires for my 71
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Westy (1600cc).......Got the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; right tire it's just a matter of what width..
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; well for a little more stability and better (IMO) handling you could
&gt; &gt; &gt; 205/70R14 tires...they are almost identical in outside diameter to
&gt; &gt; &gt; stock 185/14 tires that are stock.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; One other thing to think about is that early bays have the worm-and-
&gt; &gt; peg steering box that is weaker than the later worm-and-roller box.
&gt;
&gt; but Bentley says  that the worm and peg is bigger and stronger than the
&gt; previous units starting in 1968

The 68-72 worm-and-peg box might be stronger than a splitty box, but they
still proved failure-prone after radial tires began to be used.  I think
that this is why the '73-up went with the worm-and-roller box.

&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, the two boxes do not interchange.  My theory is that
&gt; &gt; the increased steering effort of the radial tires over the original
&gt; &gt; narrow bias ply tires caused more steering box failures, prompting the
&gt; &gt; change.  For this reason, I've resisted the urge to go to wider tires
&gt; &gt; on my '71.  If you do make the switch, make sure you are moving before
&gt; &gt; steering to reduce stress on the peg.
&gt;
&gt; I have not noticed significant differences between the 185 and 205 tires,
&gt; but it has been a long time since I used the narrow tires

One tends to adapt to differences in steering effort.  The wider contact
patch requires more effort to turn.  Longer lever arm gives more torque.
