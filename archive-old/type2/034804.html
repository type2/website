Subject: re: beetle engine into '70 bus

I have an old bus engine (no rear mount) in my '69 right now. I have to 
admit it is just to move it around while I rebuild a 1600 dp but it does 
seem to work. I really worry about that adapter though it just doesn't seem 
like a very good idea. I wouldn't plan on using it for long especially if 
you had to drive a great distance. The main problem is that I can't get it 
to seal very well around the studs so it is constantly drooling. One tip if 
you do install the beetle engine make sure that when you change the studs 
for the oil pump (longer ones are in the kit) they don't foul the tin that 
sits under the crank pulley.
