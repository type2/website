Subject: RE: [T2] Bus for sale

&gt;Ok. I'm done now.

If you have the space for it, which it seems that you do, it couldn't hurt 
to wait a week or two to make sure you really want to sell it.  For the 
price you're asking, I'm sure you can unload it quickly, but once it's gone, 
it's gone.

Even if it's your final and solid decision to sell it, humor everyone that's 
encouraging you to wait a bit.  Don't touch it, don't look at it...just let 
it sit, let the frustration die down and then pick your path.  At least then 
you can say you told us so....

Good things come to those who wait......I have more cliches and other old 
adages, but I'll save them for now....
