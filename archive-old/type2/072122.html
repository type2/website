Subject: front wheel bearing seal mystery

hi all - i heard some scraping sounds in my front right brake drum, so i
opened it up for full inspection. mostly i wanted to see if i experienced
any unusual wear to the shoes, and to find whether the wheel cylinders were
operating properly. what i found was a brand new, week old inner wheel
bearing seal separated from its spring. i replaced it last week because the
previous seal was beat up the same way. any help why this might happen (as
i reach for a new seal)??       THANKS

- steve
