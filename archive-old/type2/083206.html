Subject: engine removal/supporting tranny

Hi All,

I have a 1972 Westy with a siezed 1800 that I will be replacing with my new 2.0 AVP this weekend.  I have been reading the procedures in Bentley and am confused about a support bar under the transmission when you remove the engine (Engine and clutch, Pg 9, paragraph 16).  Is this necessary for my year and engine?  Could I use a scissors jack or something to do the job instead?

BTW: I think it was Steve and Rob who have recently installed their 2.0 AVP engines.  How are they running, any problems as of yet?  

And: Would someone repost the oil temp setup with the temp guage from radio shack that you mount in the dipstick tube.

Thanks,
Ed (Media, PA)
'72 Westy, &quot;Otto&quot;
