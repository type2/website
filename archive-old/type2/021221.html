Soon, I'll be more of an expert. I've got a 67 bug that I'm restoring that has a
messed up sunroof. It was covered with plexiglas and screws when I got it. And
the drain tubes did not extend thru the floor, but rather ended up in the front
door posts, causing  tons of rust. I got new cables from Wolfsburg West. There
are differences between the cranks of bugs, buses and vanagons. Different number
of turns lock to lock.
I think the main cause of leaks is plugged drain tubes. The seals are not
totally waterproof, but the water that leaks thru is captured by the pan and
directed out thru the tubes.
I DO know that my 82 diesel Vanagon has a sunroof and I love it! Lots of turns
(27?) but no possiblity of air conditioning with this car. Really would be nice
travelling in canyon. I also have a 58 deluxe sunroof bus. The original owner
told me of taking vacations thru Rocky Mountain National Park and the views were
awesome thru the sunroof! something his kids would never forget!
I'd go for it , but it WILL be a lot of work.

&gt; Looking for advice.

&gt; I have a 79 that has the sunroof siliconed in place. That in itself looks
&gt; bad and probably means the worst regarding fixing it.
&gt; I asked the local VW mechanic and restoration expert about helping me fix
&gt; it, and he informed me that the only time he threatened to quit working on
&gt; VWs was when the VW Dealer he worked for made him work on broken
&gt; sunroofs.....
&gt;
&gt; So, what are the choices?
&gt; #1  Bite the bullet and fix it. Cables are $94 a piece (need two) at
&gt; Wolfsburg West. Add seals and we are getting into the $400 dollar range.
&gt; #2 Yank it off and replace it with something:
&gt;     a. a poptop camper fits over the hole. Many sizes will fit. It would
&gt; cost a minimum of $200+ for an old poptop+ seals+stuff
&gt;     b. a ragtop sunroof, like the fancy one in California.... I have heard
&gt; these things exceed $1000. (what's more I have never even seen one....and at
&gt; prices like that, I can see why....)
&gt;
&gt; Ideas? Suggestions?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
