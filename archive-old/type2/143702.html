And you won't be able to time it to 5 before until you
fix the retard. 

You have 1 of 2 things wrong with the retard:

1) the retard diapraghm is ruptured and leaking 
which means you need another one

or 

2) the breaker plate is frozen in the distributor.
To check this: at idle, connect the retard line (the
one with vacuum) to the outer, advance side.
Does the engine speed up? 
Yes, the plate is not frozen and the vacuum unit is
bad.
No, the plate is frozen or the advance side of the
vacuum unit is also bad.
