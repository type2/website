The best book I know for the kind of info you are looking for is   
&quot;Original VW BUS&quot;.
Haven't got it with me right now and I'm on hol's until Jan 4th, if you   
have trouble locating a copy of the book (got mine from Waterstones) give   
me a mail direct and I'll have a look through the book for the info you   
need and pass it on.
