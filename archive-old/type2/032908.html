Subject: kennedy engine conversions

I'm l ooking for details from anyone who has converted their post-71
type II / pre-vanagon over to a Toyota TC1 or TC2, Nissan V6, or Subaru
1.8 EFI.

I've found some info from the archives from Mark Chambers who did a
Subaru conversion, i've seen the roadcow's web page, and I've talked a
little with Kennedy Engines, but I'd love to connect with some folks who
have actually used the Kennedy kits. Kennedy recommended a Nissan V6,
but I'm not sure I need that much extra horsepower, and I've heard the
1800 subaru's are smaller and easier to access, maintain, and last
longer.

Also, if anyone has heard of someone putting a Subaru 2.2 in an
pre-vanagon bus, I'd really like to find out how you got around the
tank/air intake problem.

Thanks,
Victor
