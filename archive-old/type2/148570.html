Subject: Re: [T2] VW parts vendor with fastest delivery...

Corbett,

Are you placing your Bus Depot orders online? I have found that this
usually takes longer. Its my understanding that they pull their online
orders daily at around 4pm and process them. Most likely these orders
don't get shipped until the next day. So if you place an order at 7pm
on Monday night, they pull your order 4pm Tuesday, and your order
probably goes out Wednesday afternoon. Then add the shipping time and
you can see why it might take a week to get there.

I'm in upstate New York and usually my ground orders come over-night -
that is once the order is processed and shipped.

Don't get me wrong, I get almost all my stuff from the Depot, I love
the quality and service. No bad experiences or inferior quality parts.
I have found if you need something out the door fast it's best to call
them sometime in the morning and see if they can arrange to have it
shipped that day.

good luck!

&gt; BD is one of the only places that I deal with, but I always have to order
more
&gt; than a week before I need the part. If you do not pay for fast shipping,
then
&gt; it takes 7 days to process your order, then it is shipped. Always has been
&gt; this way for me. I just know this and try to order early.
&gt; I am also in Va, not far from BD.
