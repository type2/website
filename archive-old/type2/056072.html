Subject: Re: Can a solenoid be swapped w/o removing starter? ('80)

again.  Put
&gt;my socket on the terminal with the braided ground wire to the starter 
and

It's not a ground wire.  It is a power wire.  The solenoid sends gobs of 
juice thru that braided wire to turn the starter motor.



&gt;Guy on phone tried to convince me to go with the whole enchilada, but I 
went
&gt;with the solenoid, because I assumed that my starter was fine.  I also
&gt;ordered the Bosch WR1 starter relay kit.  Has anyone replaced the 
solenoid
&gt;without removing the starter?  

Can't be done.  You must remove the starter (it's really not hard, 15 
minutes tops).  However, you can't remove the solenoid from the starter 
once you get it out unless you have an impact screwdriver.  Those screws 
that hold the solenoid to the starter are very very tight.


If I have to remove the whole thing, perhaps
&gt;I should replace the whole thing.  

Nah, if your problem is the solenoid, replace the solenoid.


Bottom bolt of the starter looks easy,
&gt;but what do I have to remove to get to the top bolt if necessary? 

Go in engine compartment, find the upper right side engine mounting bolt 
(forward of the throttle valve), remove the nut on the engine side and 
then go under and withdraw the bolt on the starter side.
