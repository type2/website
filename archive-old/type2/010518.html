Hi Guys and Gals,
     I was reading in a back issue of VW TRENDS about modifying the 34PICT3 
carb.They were using some miniature reamers to open the various jets and 
some type of gauge to measure hole sizes. My question is - where can I get 
some of those miniature reamers and that measuring gauge!! Anybody know!!
Regards,
