Subject: [T2] &quot;rostyle&quot; wheels

Gentlepersons-
                      Besides your bus, any list members have wheels for 4 
stud 15 inch Beetle
application. The ones I'm looking for are manufactured by Lemmerz, with a 
raised 8 spoke pattern, 8 oblong holes near the rim, between each spoke. 70's 
or so vintage?
TIA
