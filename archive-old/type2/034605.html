Subject: Valve seat out

Took head off right side.  #1 valve seat apparently fell out and is now
lodged at an angle between valve and head.  To make matters worse there is a
very shiny ding about 3/4&quot; long and 1/16&quot; wide in the piston, made by the
valve in its current nonstandard position.

Guess I'm buying a new piston, rings, cylinder.  Am I buying an entire set?
This is a 2L engine and the price of a set of four is kinda ouch.  Am I
buying a new head as well?  That hurts too.

I read in Wilson's book that installing valve seats is a major job of shrink
fitting.  However, I have access to liquid nitrogen (to cool the seat) and a
well-controlled lab oven that will go to 250 deg C or more.  How practical
would it be to put in a new seat meself?
