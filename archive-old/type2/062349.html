Subject: Clara &amp; I go to Action!

Hi,
Clara is sitting here &amp; says she saw 5 bugs and 2 buses on the
way to Gloucester from Oxford. Oh, and 3 of the bugs were red.
Clara also says, 'Duncan is really a nice guy, don't give him a
hard time' and 'He's a great driving companion and won't fall
asleep at the wheel' 
(So, I stand corrected, Duncan)  :-)

Well, we're off to VW Action UK tomorrow morning. Will tell you
all about it. Any UK-ers going?

Clara is also coming on the mini Europe trip next week (if I get
all the insurance etc. sorted out in time) where Split Screen Van
Club (UK) meets Bulli-Kartei (Germany). I hope Splitty is up to
it....
