Subject: Re: [T2] Light Question

I am getting something similar on my '80. The brake light 
comes on when the rev's drop. If I am driving down the 
highway and decide to shift to neutral (for whatever reason) 
the brake light comes on as the revs drop to idle. Even if I 
do not touch the brakes.

I suspect the alternator is on its last legs but that is 
just a guess. Let me know what you find out.

Thanks,
Chris

&gt;
&gt;Evening, all-
&gt;
&gt;I just noticed this quirk. When I stat up on warm mornings 
and the engine
&gt;idles low for a minute or two, the alternator light stays 
on until the revs
&gt;come up. That is expected. What I noticed is the the 
little 'B' brake
&gt;circuit light also stays on and then goes off when the 
alternator light
&gt;does. Is this typical, or normal? Does this indicate that 
the brake light is
&gt;hooked up wrong?
&gt;
&gt;Just wondering,
