Subject: Center Bore

Hello.

I saw this 'quote' at the site  http://www.tyretraders_dot_com/fitguide.htm

&quot;Centre Bore - this is an easy one! The centre of the wheel has a hole to 
allow a tight fitment of the wheel onto the hub. If the hole is too big, 
then the weight of the car is being supported on the wheel studs/bolts 
instead of on the hub as it should be, and there will be a lot of vibration 
because the wheel can become offset to the hub when it all rotates. . . .&quot;

On my '78, the center of the rim is not a circle cut, but five lobes.  I 
don't believe my wheel is supported by the hub (no marks on the hub), but by 
the studs.

My '72 wheel rim has a center cutout as a circle.  Does the '72 rim rest on 
the hub??

Confused in Springfield
