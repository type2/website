Subject: Re: [T2] 2002 VW Classic

Woo hoo! You got a pic of my 70  Westy (with tent) in there. That was before 
I had a chance to pop the top. The tent came in handy when the drizzles 
arrived later. What a fun time we had! Someone placed a 'Save the Bays' 
stickie inside while I was out. Thanks whoever you are, I will display it 
proudly!
