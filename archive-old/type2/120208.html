Subject: burnt bus reaction

&quot;When my baby is born in this Spring, I will probably
have to sell the bus and tighten up my finances. To
me, that's the only responsible decision I can make.&quot;&quot;

Huh what? I have one in college and one about to
graduate from High School.. DAS bus has been the best
choice IMHO.
300 a month for car payments or spend some putter
time..
You might want to go ahead a sell it now.. save
yourselfe
some money starting now! yeah right! Wow!
