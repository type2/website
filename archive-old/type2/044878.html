Hi Bob,

Take it to a good alignment shop, and have them do a 4-wheel alignment for
you.  With out the proper measuring equipment I don't think you can get it
close enough.  As the Bentley book says, &quot;the rear can be checked properly
only with optical wheel alignment equipment.&quot;  I mean, we're talkin' minutes
here not degrees.

Keep smiling,

Mike
