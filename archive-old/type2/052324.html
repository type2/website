Subject: [T2] Swearing, screaming, and starting....Chapter 2

Hiya All,

As you may recall, I recently posted a question concerning the location of 
the starter bolt/nut behind the engine (70 Bus - stock) and apparent sadistic 
inclinations of VW engineers in the late sixties.
Well, thank you listees for coming through.  I appreciate all the advice.  
And I'm here to say the job is done and it was done much easier because of 
that advice.
I am left with a question though.....   Apparently the PO had rigged up some 
sort of hard-start device.  I pulled out a Hella relay (171 919 505A) which 
had been hooked between starter, battery and ground.  Is this, indeed, a 
hard-start relay?
The reason I ask is that I cleaned all the connections and installed the new 
starter without the relay.  That engine started up like it had been kicked by 
a mule on steroids.  
So.................if this was a hard-start relay.................why was it 
there?
