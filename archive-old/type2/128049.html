Subject: Re: [T2] Saggy front suspension

most wish they had your problem.. sounds to me like
your bus likes to sit low, the way gravity intended it
to be.. if it were only my bus !!

sagging front end i've never heard of, rear yes and
that looks cool if the front is lowered it looks
level, most bus' ride to high so im sure yours looks
better and more level..

good luck,
rob
