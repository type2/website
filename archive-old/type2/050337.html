Subject: [T2] Gen/Alt Pedestal Assembly

Well, having just bought a new 1600dp long block and having
hurriedly stripped my old one for it's core, I did not
properly note the orientation of the metal gasket that lies
between the altnerator pedestal and the engine block. 
You know, the one that looks like:
	 ______
	| )))) |
	 ------

So, does anyone know off the top of their head:

a) whether the metal &quot;baffles&quot; (for lack of a better word) on the gasket
	point up into the pedestal or down into the block
	(i seem to recall down into the block)

b) which direction the )))) point in (left, i believe).

I've got it on there, and it looks right, but I'd rather get
it right first off and my bentley, which i'm assuming has this
sort of info, still hasn't arrived in the mail.  *sigh*

thanks,
