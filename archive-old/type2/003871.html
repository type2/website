Hydraulics collapse after sitting. Depends on the position of the hole in
the side of the lifter. If it is pointing down, it will bleed off quickly.
Just drive the bus.....the lifter will pump back up. It may take up to 5
miles. I would not change them back to solids.


&gt; It's just one thing after another this week.
&gt;
&gt; My bus (74, 1.8 ltr) has been sitting for 3 days while I repaired the
&gt; ignition switch. I just started it and now there's a loud valve clatter,
&gt; sounds like #1 or #2. This engine has just over 1000 miles on it since AVP
&gt; built the long block. (Came with the bus; purchased by the PO) It has
&gt; hydraulic lifters, which is a first for me in a VW. I let it run for a few
&gt; minutes to see if it would quiet down but no luck. Once it's cooled off
I'm
&gt; going to check the valve adjustment to see if it's just a loosened
adjusting
&gt; screw. (hope, hope!)
&gt;
&gt; Question is: A) Can I replace the bad lifter without removing the engine?
&gt; and B) Can I replace the hydraulic lifters with solid lifters without
&gt; replacing the cam shaft? I assume I'd need the solid lifters and the
correct
&gt; push rods and a set of push rod seals. Can it be done, or would I have to
&gt; split the case?
