Subject: drippy tubes- still

I'm interested in knowing if anyone anywhere in the world has experienced petrol dripping from the accelerator-pump injector tubes after having switched off when the engine is at working temperature. the carbs in question are twin pdsit32- 34 fitted to my 1980 2000cc ac transporter with 150 000 miles clocked
My local dealer who is also  N. Ireland distributor has not seen it before and unable to help me.  Replies and comments would be very much appreciated. Many thanks JOE&gt;
