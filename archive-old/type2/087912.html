I saw this in South Austin today:

1978 VW Westfalia

* Pop-top, stove, etc.
* Dark biege
* Needs some minor body work in a few spots
* Not terribly rusty, except for the usual rust under windshield
* Some moron ripped out FI stuff; single carb in place
* No foam seal around engine compartment (not good)
* Unknown running condirion

Bus was parked at Taco Express on South Lamar, near Matt's El Raunchy =
restaurant

This phone number (512) 707-9231 was written in shoe polish on the =
windshield,=20
along with a price of $2200.

You now know as much as I do about this bus.

R.D.
'79 bus
