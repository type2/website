Re the lack of go and fuel exhaust fumes.  Just on an outside chance make sure that you haven't been visited by mice or squirrels during your lay-up.  I've had remarkable amounts of nesting materials accumulate in the strangest places while storing for long periods until I learned to plug them.  Check to make sure your intake and exhaust systems are free of nest debris.  I've found nests in the air cleaner box and in the muffler.
