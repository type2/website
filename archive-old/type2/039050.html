Subject: Engine Warmup

I hope you folks aren't getting tired of my &quot;newbie simple questions&quot;, but I 
have another one. I thought I remembered reading in Muir's book about 
allowing the time during warmup for it to get sufficiently warm before 
putting it in gear, and I looked around and there it was on page 36. Last 
night I'm reading the original owner's manual for my &quot;new to me&quot; 70' 
Dormobile, and it says&quot;Do not try to warm the engine up by letting it idle 
with the vehicle stationary- drive off straight away&quot;. What gives? I will 
pick up the bus on Friday with a new 1600 cc engine, and I want to learn it 
and baby it, but this is confusing. It ought to be a simple thing it seems, 
but what should I do?
