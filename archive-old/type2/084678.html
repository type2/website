&gt;HI,
&gt;I need an alternator for my 74 bus. I would like a
&gt;good used one since new ones are out of my price
&gt;range.

Consider your need for results. If you do the labor to put in a used one 
that you and the seller think is ok, and it's not or it fails in 3 months, 
then what is the value of your time lost to get another and do that damned 
R&amp;R again??? As I recall, the first one I did with the motor installed took 
me half a day at least. It's still over an hour for me now with a dozen or 
so replacements in as many years. That doesn't count the time to hunt up a 
replacement bracket for the broken one from the last poor install, then 
waiting for it to arrive.

At least half the T-III/IV motors I have seen have a broken alternator 
adjustment bracket. Getting to that top mount nut for the bracket is a 
dilly, the hardest fastener on the whole machine to get to. If it's not 
tight, it will work loose and the bracket will vibrate and break.

Make certain that you install the plate on the front of the alternator. 
Without that it's a huge breach in the cooling air system. Same goes for 
the adjustment bolt access slot. If you lost the plastic piece that covers 
it, at least seal it with duct tape.
