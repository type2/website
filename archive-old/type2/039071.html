Subject: Oil Cooler Question??

Hello Everyone...I was reading Muir's book last night a he mentioned a 
particular oil cooler (called Rveeco) that is suppose to cool 100% of the 
oil..as opposed to the stock oil coolers that only cool 30-40%...Any thoughts 
on Muir's subtle bias on oil coolers? Also...what is the deal on Warming up 
the engine...I have been following Muir's 3 minute idle warm up...is it a 
waste of time? Going to finally get at my Brakes and Master Cylinder this 
coming weekend...Thanks for the help..Adam
