&gt; 
&gt; If you can keep track of the orientation and loading of both ends of both
&gt; half-shafts, you are way ahead of me and either of the above will do.  If
&gt; not, what you need to do is to make sure it is loaded in the opposite
&gt; direction when you reinstall the CV.  The best way to do this is to clean
&gt; the livin' tar (and believe me, some of that tar is *livin'*! :) out of a
&gt; spot on the outside edge of each CV before you remove them and mark the
&gt; direction of rotation on the edge of the CV.  You know, an arrow.  Use
&gt; something that is not petroleum soluble, like a carbide scratch awl or a
&gt; die grinder.  Then make sure that when you put them back on, the arrow
&gt; points the other way.
&gt; 
&gt; Second, flopping axles will flop the direction, and you don't need to pull
&gt; the joints to flop the axles. *But* once you have the axles off, if you
&gt; don't clean and regrease them before reinstalling them, I promise you that
&gt; after you die, Ben Pon *will* chase you thru the aisles of eternity
&gt; scourging you for the rest of time with a frayed clutch cable :-)  And to
&gt; really clean and regrease them, you need to remove them from the half
&gt; shaft, becasue there is no way to get the cage off the inner hub with the
&gt; inner hub on the shaft.
&gt; 
&gt; Any further opposing viewpoints? :-)

Well, I'll put in some opposition for the complete removal and cleaning.
I think that more damage and debris introduced by cleaning than you would
if you simply wiped the excess grease away with clean paper towels and
regreased without disassembly.  Now if the joint is truly dirtied this
does not apply, but if replacing a boot for a minor crack I'd take the
less invasive course.
