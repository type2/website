Subject: Re: [T2] Is my buss worth working on

--0-2041851540-1016949859=:26312


 
&gt;1.How long have you had this bus?
&gt;Only 3 months, i got it from a friend of mine who had the buss many years.

&gt;2.How committed are you to getting it fixed?
&gt;Well, I am commited but I don´t know how much...

&gt;3.Is that actually a factory sliding roof sunroof that I can see in the 
&gt;first pic?
&gt;I don´t know but I can get a better picture of it if you like? How can I 
&gt;find out if it is a factory sliding roof?
Umm, I believe it should be all metal and has a small winder inside to open &amp; close it.


&gt;4.my bus came from Lenartsfors originally ,I think ,where is that?
&gt;It´s up in the north of sweden(I think), it´s very dry and cold there so 
&gt;they have a lot of rust-free cars.
Let's hope your's is too :-)


&gt;5.Have you tried to push a screwdriver through
&gt;the rust areas?
&gt;Yes, on some places I can push it through but not on the most importent 
&gt;places (I think).
Well, that's a good sign.
Incidentally, have you checked out the entire cab floor &amp; steps, the battery tray on the right hand side of the engine bay &amp; the bottom of the windscreen?

These are prime places for rust as well as those skirts &amp; the floor in the back where you've already found rust.

&gt;I have the hole summer(maximum) to fix the car but I don´t have very much 
&gt;cash. I can borrow a MIG from a friend if I like but I have never used a 
&gt;MIG.
&gt;I really need a lot of tips about how to weld, where can I find 
&gt;information(exept type2)?
Mmmm, it's probably not a bad idea for you to do a short 6 or 8 week welding course at evening college........I did one myself, it was fairly cheap &amp; even though I haven't done much work at home since it means I know what's involved.

Welding is practise more than anything else as anyone here would tell you so it's best if you can get some help to get started &amp; then spend a little while just welding the sort of old thin steel you'll have to on the bus.......it's different to new mild steel &amp; a little more difficult to do so you want to make your mistakes on scrap.

&gt;How hard is my buss to fix? Can I do it? I don´t have much experiense.

Well, it all depends on how persistant you are.......also get you friend to look at the bus; what does he think of the rust? He'll be able to give you an idea as to what is going to be hard.

What you will need is at least 2 wheel stands so that when you get to welding the skirts &amp; particularly the wheel guards you can get down on the ground without the fear of the bus collapsing on you.

Remember you'll also need an angle grinder with cutting &amp; grinding wheels for any metal work you doing to clean &amp; cut an area &amp; needs be.

Also there are heaps of rust conversion products these days that are epoxy based &amp; if the metal isn't too far gone in places you can spot weld small holes &amp; paint it with converter, providing they aren't load bearing members.
&gt;If you need more pictures of the bus I can get it(and smaller ones too), 
&gt;just tell me what to shoot on.

Well an inside shot of the sun-roof would be good to get a better idea.

Just out of interest, what size engine is it running?

:-)

Cheers

Andrew Wood
