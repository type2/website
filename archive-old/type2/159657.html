Subject: so maybe the snow isn't so bad afterall

I got up and shoveled the 8 or so inches of new snow off the driveway 
and decided to put the snow chains on the bus.  They were given to me by 
the guy that sold me my pair of captains chairs for $50.  Anyway they 
fit the hankook's just fine, and me and the kids took the bus for a test 
run.  She did great in the snow with the chains.  I had to stop and 
laugh at the neighbor kid in his old blazer that got stuck in the 
cul-de-sac.  The bus just chewed through it all.  Here's a couple pics.
