can 
&gt; &gt;you give me some insite to the headlight project.  kind of lights any
&gt; special
&gt; &gt;things you have to configure?  
&gt; =================================&gt;
&gt; Hi Mike,
&gt; I  bought direct plug in replacement headlights and backup lights at
Pep
&gt; Boys. Just took the old ones out and put the new halogen ones in their
&gt; place. This was for my '69 bus, and am gonna do the same to my '70
as soon
&gt; as I &quot;get to it&quot; !
&gt; 
&gt; Works great! ................ Lots of extra light going down the road 

There are halogen bulbs and halogen bulbs.

You can buy halogen sealed beams that are drop-in replacements for the
original sealed beams.  They will give you more light but the light
will only be as well controlled as the original lights.  These bulbs
are DOT approved and completely legal.

The other halogen bulbs you can get are the separate-bulb H4 halogen
headlights that are used in europe.  The lenses are better made
because they are reused, but expect to pay more for good ones.  Hella
and Bosch make good lenses.  These lights are techically illegal, as
they are not DOT approved, but are commonly used.  This is the better
way to go, IMO, as the beam quality is much more even with no &quot;hot&quot; or
dim spots.  You can also carry a replacement bulb in a smaller space.
