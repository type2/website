Subject: Re: A loving mechanic in/near Austin Texas?

Our '82 Westy who lives near Austin Texas needs a thorough check-out before 
taking us to Alaska; plus a bit of bodywork; plus the odometer doesn't work; 
plus I removed the EGR linkage to prevent it stalling on our last trip (do I 
sound like I don't know what I'm doing? yep); plus one of the outside wing 
mirrors is loose and keeps being blown out of position whenever a semi 
passes; plus when you fill it with petrol -- sorry, gas -- it leaks a bit 
when you fill it right up.

Now if I was really a true Listee I'd be asking if anyone knows a source of 
left-threaded hypercycloidal fabernagle valves and so on, but it's just not 
my gift. (Algorithm complexity, relational database design, Paul's 
contribution to Christianity, theories of consciousness, yes, but they 
didn't wire up that part of my brain that deals with mechanical things, 
okay?)

So ... I need to find a really enthusiastic Volkswagen-loving mechanic (or 
team of such) who is not working with a timesheet-foreman and stopwatch 
behind him (or her! why not?) within striking distance of Austin Texas (of 
Dripping Springs, to be more precise) who can fix all these, or tell me why 
they're not worth fixing, ideally who'll explain what's going on while 
he/she's doing it [yes, I know they charge extra for this, it's okay]. I 
don't expect them to be the cheapest in town. (Someone told me there's a 
motorcycle repair place in North Carolina which has a sign up, &quot;We do Good 
Work, we do Fast Work, we do Cheap Work, pick any two out of three.&quot;)

Can anyone help? Thanks in advance! (I live in England and come over to the 
States every year for two months with the bus. So I only have a small time 
window to get it fixed.) Please send me a pmail, whatever that is, if you 
can suggest anyone.
