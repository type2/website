Subject: [T2] timing a 050

Well all we're still stuck in Pine Grove,Pa. My dizzy has completely
crashed.
The van will crank and idle(roughly) but has no advance at all. The dizzy
was sporadic before but would seem to correct itself after a moment at idle.
I am hoping this is also the answer to the running lean problem since the
ECU is timed from the dizzy.

My question is what specs is the 050 supposed to be timed. I have one on the
way and should be here in the a.m. Would appreciate some info before the
morning if possible.

Thanks to everyone who has in one way or the other helped me and my family
during this long strange trip.

Thanks
