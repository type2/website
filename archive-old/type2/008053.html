Hello, 

I know the subject sounds wishy wash but hear me out.

Now that things are cool woth the 69, the fate of the '72 is up in the air.
Both buses are 7 passenger buses. The 69 was, until yesturday, a one owner
bus in suprisingly good shape. It is without a doubt a keeper. The '72 is
also in good shape but 2 passenger buses is kinda overkill for our little
family. 

Doc Roc has kindly offered me the Westfalia camping interior from a 69 that
he has stashed at his mountaintop hideout. It is my intention to transplant
the wayward 69 camping interior into the '72. However..........

The 72 is an almost completely stock passenger bus and I sorta feel ashamed
to alter its character. It has served us well:15,000 in the last 13 months
and it has not let us down yet. So before I go and muck up a stock bus I
want to offer it to the list.

Here are some details.
&quot;72 bus(built 12/71)
95,000 miles 
1700 (CB code on the case and no known rebuilds)
Weber progressive,009, bosch coil
Interior shows wear but is complete sans kick panels
New Sachs clutch installed a coupla weeks ago
A few rust spots here and there but no cancer of holes
Used to have a battery tray:). ok, one hole
Good tires
Door and window rubber is so so
This bus has very noticeable heat. At hwy speeds it is down right hot
inside.
Well maintained by me and the PO.
price:?
Please P-mail if interested, If not it becomes a camper.

Chris
