Mark:

Take off all the large hoses you can get to, one at a time, and check 
them for leaks by blowing into one end while plugging the other end.  
Take off the intake air elbow and check it carefully, especially at the 
lowere elbow where it tends to crack.

Finally, if you have a compressor (or a friend willing to take the part) 
with the engine cold, remove the AFM and plug up the air intake hose (I use 
the top off a big bottle of laundry detergent), plug the exhaust pipe 
(another, smaller cap), detach the hose that runs from the air intake 
elbow to the aux air regulator at the air intake elbow end and plug up 
that hole (I use a cork).

Attach your compressor (or friend) to the open end of the hose running 
into the aux air regulator and start the pressure.  (With the engine 
cold, the aux air regulator should be open, allowing the air into the air 
distribution box.)  Have a spary bottle of soapy water and maybe a swap 
and start spraying/swabbing at all joints, hose connetions, etc.  Any 
leaks should show up a big bubbles and you can start fixing things. 

I find this a lot safer than using flammable items around a running 
engine, plus, you end up with a cleaner engine!

&gt; about checking for it or have any other ideas on what it might be?
