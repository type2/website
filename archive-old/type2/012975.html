Hello listees:

I'm considering buying the dual 40mm Kadron carb kit for my 71 bus.  I'm putting a few performance-minded parts into my new engine, so I figured I should get some dual carbs.  Has anyone used this carb set-up, or maybe the dual 34 ICT Weber's??  I talked to a couple of local VW parts places, and they both said the Kadron's work better than the Weber ICT's.  It would be nice to hear from someone who isn't trying to sell me some carbs.  My engine is a 1641 with CB Performance 044 heads, 1.25:1 rockers, headers, Engle 100 cam.

Thanks!

Jim Hood
