Subject: Re: [T2] headrests

Steve, you should add the word 'bay' in that sentence:
&quot;let me add that all the headrests fit all the seats&quot;

Vanagon headrests have thinner posts. Lately there are a lot of posts about
people putting Vanagon seats in late bays.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Does anyone have a pair of headrests from an early 70s bus.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; How early?  They did not appear until 73....
&gt; &gt; 73 were one-year-only, they have a pushbutton release on each post.
&gt; &gt; 74-75 were soft vinyl with a zipper along the bottom from post to post.
Nice
&gt; &gt; comfortable headrests, but age is getting to them. The material between
the
&gt; &gt; zipper and the vinyl self-destructs over time.
&gt; &gt; 76-79 are hard molded vinyl. The edge that sits in the sun suffers the
most.
&gt; &gt; They crack there if you push on the material.
&gt; &gt; 68-72 seats do not have the supports for the headrests.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have lots of headrests in almost every color available except black.
Black
&gt; &gt; is very hard to find. The most common soft ones were off-white. The most
&gt; &gt; common hard bus one is brown [also is in Westies]. The most common hard
Westy
&gt; &gt; one is green. A very tough one to find is the red/brown 78/79 Champagne
&gt; &gt; Edition.
&gt;
&gt; In addition to what Karl says, let me add that all the headrests fit all
&gt; the seats You can put a green '78 Westy headrest on your beige basketweave
&gt; '73 seats, ferinstance... ugly as sin, but they will fit!  Also, I found
&gt; some '72 seats that had the tubes in the top of the seat framess for the
&gt; headrests, bu the vinyl had not been cut (and by the time I found them it
&gt; didn't have to be, as it was badly torn :-) so '72 seats *may* do you as a
&gt; base to add headrests to.  AFAIK, however, the headrests only started in
&gt; '73, so these frames may have been a replacement from a '73.
