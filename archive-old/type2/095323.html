Hi All

Unplugging the 12 Volts (black wire) from the coil disables coil action and 
the trigger to the ECU (no injection pulses and no spark). Using a remote 
starter switch (starter pin 30 to starter pin 50 )won't power up the coil 
and gets the same result. It seems to me that in either case the pump will 
run during the starter activation and fuel pressure will build up.

Chuck
