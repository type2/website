Subject: NEW Owners Manuals &amp; Dealer Tech Books  (Ltd. Quantity,
  N.O.S.!)

I just bought a defunct VW dealer's remaining inventory of original Bus
and Vanagon owners and factory tech manuals. This lot includes original
Bus and Campmobile owners manuals, plus tech manuals that were meant for
dealer distribution covering everything from fuel injection to gas
heaters to wiring.  These have been out of print for a good 20 years.
There are some real finds here. They are not grease stained used manuals
with torn covers, but new manuals. However they may have minor cover
wear just from being moved around a few times over the last two decades.

Prices start at $10 for owners manuals, and even the most expensive one
(the factory gas heater repair/troubleshooting manual) is under $30. By
comparison, Rocky Mountain Motorworks charged $25-$30 for their limited
selection of original owners manuals.

I have as few as one of some of these, and nothing in large quantities.
I have put them on the website at
http://busdepot_dot_com/catalog.jsp?model=100 . You can order from there
just like any other Bus Depot part (and combine with tune up parts or
whatever else to save on shipping if you'd like). I will do my best to
take each one off of the site as it sells out but can't make any
guarantees. If the book you've ordered is already gone I'll email you to
let you know.  This page is not linked from the main Bus Depot website
and is only for list members.

Incidentally, I will be using this URL for other upcoming list member
only offers, so stay tuned.
