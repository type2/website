Subject: [T2] Atlanta Emissions Issues

Volks:

New denizen of Atlanta seeks advice:

Does anyone have any tips for getting my '77 through emissions?  I'm
going to tune it up and make sure it is warmed up before bringing it in,
of course.  In the event that it fails, it might be use ful to bring it
to an inspection station that is familiar with L-Jet (for VW or other).
Any suggestions?  There are plenty of VW shops, apparently, but none of
the ones I've seen do emissions.

Before I can even get it tested, I'm supposed to set it up with a
catalytic converter, which is going to require tracking down an ok
crossover tube, which is NLA new.  Any tips on junkyards that might have
one?

I've lots of other questions, but I'll wait, since these are the most
pressing.
