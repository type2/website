Subject: Starter troubles..I think

Does this sound starter related:  I have a new battery (3 weeks old), reads 12.8 volts, but when I turn my ignition key, I have to hold the key for about 2-3 seconds before the engine starts to turn over and when it does turn over, it is very slow.  After a 2 or 3 tries the starter begins to spin a little faster but still about half the speed it used spin.  I have not load tested the battery yet, I do have a starter relay installed.  So do you think it is the starter going out, relay is bad or the battery is at fault?  

Also, I can't remember which starter I have.  It is a 002 tranny with a 091 bell housing.  would that be the SR 87X or SR 15X?
