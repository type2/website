I don't think I am overreacting. I've gotten on my soapbox because 
since this thread started, not a single person on this list other than 
me has expressed a favorable view of aircooled engines in transporters. 
Mine seems to be a voice in the wilderness.  Everyone on this list who 
has posted, either to the list or to me off-list, has favored a swap in 
principle. The only objections that have been raised by others so far 
concern quality of workmanship in doing the swap.

I am really astounded that in this community of interest, which 
includes over 1000 subscribers, I seem to be the only person that 
actually likes and prefers transporters pretty-much-as-designed. Or who 
thinks that one of the things that is most attractive about baywindow 
buses is that they are slow and underpowered, requiring us (as drivers) 
to think and drive differently from every other driver on the road.

Obviously, I am not going to go on about this indefinitely. It looks 
like a lost cause. But it seems to me that SOMEONE ought to stand up 
for aircooleds on what, nominally, is an aircooled transporter list.
