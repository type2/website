Subject: Re: [T2] dashboard clock

Richard asked:


&gt; The earlier clocks are not quartz and tend to be sold by swap meet gougers in a broken condition. Has anyone
opened one up and noticed that they've failed in the same way these 914 VDO clocks do?

Yes, Mercedes uses the same VDO clock winder since the early 60's. Been 'fixing' them the same
way for the past 26+ years.

But one of my early early bay clocks has a different problem: The mechanical clock section is about to fall
off the face. Not really repairable....

BTW, if any one wants to convert a 6v split window deluxe bus clock to the 67 12v style, all you need to do is
install the MB 12v winder on the early bus clock. Although my 66 Deluxe still has its
original 6v clock in it and has been running fine on 12v for the past 4+ years.
