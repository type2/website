&gt;&gt; &gt;I agree, David, but think we now have to make a distinction between
&gt;&gt; &gt;types of EGR valves.  The '78 2.0 has a strictly mechanical EGR
&gt;&gt; &gt;activation via direct linkage to the throttle bellcrank, and I think
&gt;&gt; &gt;other late loafs used an electrically actuated EGR valve.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;               For what it's worth, the '81 also has a totally
&gt;mechanical EGR valve.

FWIW - Mine is late 79 model year same as Harmons 81 - totally mechanical.
Though gone with last rebuild and completely sealed off at the air plenum.
linkage removed and hole in tin sealed as well. Is this a bad thing?
