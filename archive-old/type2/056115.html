Subject: tent! Got it !!!

Chip:::

Glad you made your find!!

I bought a side tent from the original owner.  It
was only used once.

I got a great price on it. I am completely happy.
Man, I may never use it (we use a Sears  9x12 for
camping; just to mark our spot.  The drive-away
would NEVER be left alone!!! )

I missed out on some tremendous buys because I had
to think about it.  Yesterday, I bought a 16' Mad
River one man canoe (fiberglass) and mini trailer
for $275.  I was thinking that MAYBE I could get
it down another $25, or walk away.

Well, I got it, and if I never use the canoe, I am
still extremely happy about the canoe, Just as I
am about the drive away tent (I set the tent up in
the garage for 2 weeks, just 'to air it out' I
says to the wife, but I camped in that thing every
night, in my imagination.)  Great!!

Right now, I am getting all the things I want,
within reason.  No stopping me.  I just replaced
the front axle beam (rusted to pieces - thanks,
Eric!!) and I am going to grab the (brass) ring on
every go around.  Next stop, a pop corn canon!!
