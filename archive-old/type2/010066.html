Subject: Upper cot for 73
Message-ID: &lt;19990705193118.49592.qmail_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

Hi, greetings from Fresno, Calif.
I found a 73 westy at a wrecking yard today. Had the strangest upper cot 
I've seen. All others have been mounted on the right side. All others used 
part of the sunroof opening for support. Not this one. The opening in the 
roof was NOT a sunroof opening, it was a real opening. The cot mounted on 
the left side, on the front and rear edge. The mounts are 22&quot; long! Never 
seen one like it. All the rest of the bus was Westfalia. The over-the-seat 
hammock/childs cot was there, except some *&amp;%!#_at_ bimbo used it to dismantle 
the engine on! I got the bars, however they are the earlier 56 1/4&quot; ones for 
68-72.
Anybody want/need this cot?
Bars?
