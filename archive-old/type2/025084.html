&lt;&lt; See, a matco/snap-on/mac tool is more than just a tool, &gt;&gt;

If you're looking for &quot;bargain&quot; quality tools, keep an eye out for
&quot;Blue Point&quot; tools...Manufactured by Snap-On. BTW, the &quot;Husky&quot;
brand touted by Home Depot is only &quot;made to a price&quot; Stanley...
and not even Stanley, UK, who still make some quality wood-
working tools. 
Curiouser, and curiouser: A neighbor bought a blister pack of
cheepee metric sockets from Sears/Craftsman. The sockets
were stamped &quot;made in Taiwan&quot; except for the 1/2 inch sock-
et that was in the 13 mm slot...IT was stamped &quot;made in USA&quot;.
Somehow, I doubt that it was shipped from here...
Any one have any Whitworth tools for sale, BTW?
