Salutations;
I am trying to get some heat out of my '78 bus.  Could anyone provide me
with a diagram to show me exactly what components are in the heating
system and how they fit together.  What is I believe is the heater
control flap has three outlets.  One of these has a piece of old hose on
it but I don't know where it is supposed to connect.
