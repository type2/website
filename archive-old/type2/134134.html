I am afraid that we are starting to confuse two different kinds of brake
lube.

- One is for lubing the internal brake cylinder parts during rebuild -
this is what I use the ATE paste for.
- Another type prevents brake squeal - basically some stuff your smear
on the back of the pads. I use copper paste for this application.

But these are two very different application that require different
products.

spy the lube that was in the pelican parts write up, sil-glide.  i read
the label and i didn't see silicone in the list of ingredients and the
tube stated that it was for the back of brake pads and for where pads
fit
on the carriers.
