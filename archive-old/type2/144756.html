&gt; &gt; &quot;&quot;Your wrench is right Barry.
&gt; &gt; Don't heat the stud, heat the area around it.&quot;&quot;

It is very hard to heat the stud or the head without heating the other
part.  They are just too well connected.

However, differential expansion is your friend.  Put the head in the oven
and heat it up to 400F or so and it may well do wonders for the problem.
The aluminum will expand faster than the stud.

We once had the opposite problem, an aluminum shaft inside a steel
bearing.  A quick soak in liquid nitrogen freed it right up!
