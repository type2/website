Hey Y'all,
  I am triing to get my 73 Bus running right and am having to put a
new valve in #3. I have found out that the heads are 2.0L and beleive
the engine is 2.0L(new P's &amp;C's) even though the case is a 73 Auto
case(CD). My problem is that I don't know what gasket kit to buy. Bus
Depot lists 1 for the 1.7, 1 for the 1.8 and 1 for the 2.0. What kit
do I get? What is the difference?
  Once I get the engine back together I will try again to get it
running right. Any advie on where to start getting the rebuilt carbs
set right. It won't idle now and runs crappy. I assume some of that
will be fixed with the new valve. I would love any tips on setting the
carbs, they are the stock 32-34 PDSIT's.
