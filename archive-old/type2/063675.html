Subject: Re: Splitty Rescue Organization?

I second that emotion. The only splitty I have ever seen in the local
pick-n-pulls was a '67 camper that was in a head-on collision (not pretty).
By the time I got there, it was pretty well picked-n-pulled, but I did get
a VOLKSWAGEN rear logo and a blinker switch, FWIW. I find that I'm becoming
an &quot;expert&quot; at finding items compatible between baywindow buses (lots in
junkyards) and splitties. Actually, there is a place in Vista, CA (near San
Diego) called Interstate Auto that normally has a half dozen splitties or
so in the yard, along with piles of beetle parts that reach to the sky :).
However, the owner doesn't let people walk unaccompanied around the yard,
and his prices are 2-3 fold more than the pick-n-pull (e.g. 75 bucks for a
splittie front seat in &quot;good&quot; condition vs. $20 for a nearly identical seat
from a '72 at the other places). However, I do recall them having stuff
like sun visors that are hard to find. To make a long story short, maybe
that's where all the splitties go, along with the woods behind the
neighbor's house.

I have two Australia Shepherds.  One of them I got through an organization
called Aussie Rescue.  The people from Aussie Rescue go to dog pounds, etc.
and pull out Aussies and offer them up for adoption to loving homes.

Is there a Splitty Rescue out there serving the same function?  I ask that
question because I have never seen a '67 or earlier in any of the junkyards
around here.  If there is such an organization that's great...but it must
make it difficult to get used parts at bargain basment prices.
