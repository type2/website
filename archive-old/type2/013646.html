As it said, northern WV, I live in Morgantown but the '81 resides
on a farm in Clarksburg, WV.  That is roughly 5 hours from DC
maybe 3 from Pittsburg.  (304)291-3357  Still getting a lot of
interest but no definitive takers.  Once again I don't think that
canvas and top are so bad, but you got to pull off the rest as
part of the deal, sorry how it goes.  And like I've said if you are
smart and got a MIG that is the way you want it anyway.  It has
also occured to me that the clutch master was probably new (I'm sure
it was) and the slave rebuilt within 10k miles, but as the rest has
been sitting for 5 years (time flies.)  And all the bushings on the front
A-arms were new, that is a pricey job folks (PO did it not me I
just had the bill once upon a time.)  Plus steering rack, signal lenses,
etc, got to be worth someones trouble who wants a pop-top.
