Subject: Rear brakes- locating pins? stubborn drum and wear specs.

Hi volks,

	What's the story with the locating pins for the rear 
brake shoes? My Haynes manual mentions them and one of the
new backing plates (left/passenger side) has holes for them
whereas the old plates and the other side don't!
 Incidentally, one of my &quot;composite&quot; brake drums was a pig
to get off as the cylinder and stars had both seized, 
leaving the shoes tucked up behind the wear-lip of the 
drum. Eventually I got it by using a pin-punch and a large
hammer to shift the adjusting stars.

 Finally, when should the drums be ditched- mine had some 
surface corrosion and the above mentioned lip caused by
wear to the working faces, but they seemed to clean up
OK (and still have quite a bit of thickness in the metal).
 I didn't see a minimum thickness spec. in the Haynes,
but I presume there is one?

Cheers,
	 W.
