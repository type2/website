&gt;&gt; the body, there's a pretty loud &quot;POP!&quot; sound.  I'm suspecting it's one
&gt;&gt; of the ball joints, but when the alignment was done around a month ago,
&gt;&gt; the technician at Sears checked them and said they were fine.  :/  Could
&gt;&gt; be he just didn't know how to check them.

&gt; if it were a ball joint I assure you, you'd know it, the front of your van

This isn't quite true. Balljoints on busses go bad and the bus can still be
quite drivable. They do make a pop sound when bad and you go over a bump or
drop. They seldom fail catastrophically, usually people fix them long
before. The ball joints (and the rest of the front end) are very robust and
over designed, so rather than failing, they wear out and funny noises ensue,
but the front end still hangs together.
