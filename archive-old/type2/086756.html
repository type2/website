Subject: Heater parts and exhaust studs.

Hey all,

I just pulled the exhaust and heat exchangers from my 73.  They are toast.
As it happens I already have a new set.  However,  the passenger blower
duct and both heater ducts are shot.
Is there a source other then the yard for these?

Any suggestions on removeing the 6 rusted up exhaust studs that did not
come out?  I would rather not have to pull the motor or get the bus to a
shop.

TIA
