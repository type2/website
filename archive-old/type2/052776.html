&gt; &gt;    One good thing to remember is don't pull the red and green heat/fresh
&gt; &gt; adjust knobs off the levers;  they don't go back on, so unbolt them from
&gt; &gt; underneath.  Otherwise, you'll be back in the junkyard looking for some.
&gt; 
&gt; 75[?] - 79 are made to pull out.
&gt; Perhaps you are thinking of 68 - 74[?]? They weren't made to 'pull out'.
&gt; And they were red and blue :))

If you leave those damn buttons in the glove box the first time you take
them off, your 68-? levers will pull out as well. just dont lose the
springy flat bits.
