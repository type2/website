Subject:  Re: wacking the starter motor..

I had the same problem, very unpredictable so I went and tightened every
electrical connection I could. I cinched the push type connections and
filed all the copper connections that are tightened by screws and made
sure the ground cable from the battery had as good a connection as it
could get. I havent't had a miss-start since ('bout two months)
