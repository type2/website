Well I don't doubt that if you say there is a support, that there is one.  But
my Vanagon doesn't have one and the Bently says to support it when you take out
the engine.  And the vanagon in the junk yard from which I took a motor recently
didn't have one either.   John Jensen in Annapolis (who might be missing
something)
