Subject: Re: [T2]Blowby From Dipstick *(saga continues)

Chris,

Having read some of the later posts on this subject, it sounds like
a &quot;new&quot; engine.

So, where the heck is the oil coming from?

Let's go back to basics.

Are you *sure* that the dipstick is correct and you are not overfilling 
it.

Next, count the palces where oil can come out and appear on the engine 
where you see it.

*FIND THEM* and see what they look like after you go to the car wash and
completely clean the engine again.

If it comes down to it, pull the dipstick and put a rubber plug in it for 
a few miles.....no, not at the top, but at the very bottom where it comes 
out of the engine case.

Can you run a compression test?

Cheers, dave
