Subject: 68 double cab questions

Hello list,

I've been lurking and learning and quite successful with the help of the list in keeping my 71 hardtop camper on the road. I recently found what I've been searching for, a double cab in project condition. It's a 68 and I'm wondering if I can transplant the front beam from a 71 parts bus to get disc brakes on the 68? Is it a straight transfer, or is some fabricating required? Also, what about the 68 as far as parts? It was the first year of the breadloaf, are there many one of  a kind parts, are parts readily obtainable? Sure would be nice to have a truck that I could cruise in aircooled style. Thoughts from the list appreciated....

Thanks,
mrbill
