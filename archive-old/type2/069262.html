Subject: Engine saga + need help

Well. . .the engine is back in my '74 bus.  I pulled it about 4 weeks
ago to fix/replace the clutch.  The reason it took so long was because
of school and work. . . etc.

I got the old pilot bearing out (thanks for the replies, I ended up
having to pry it out with a couple of screwdrivers and a hammer).
After getting it out I had no problem putting the new pilot bearing,
front oil seal, flywheel O-ring, clutch disk and clutch pressure plate
back in with the old flywheel.  

Today at about 9:30 am I hoisted the engine up with a newly purchased
floor jack, and after about 2 hours of manouvering the stupid thing
around, I got it ALMOST in.  Try as I might, I couldn't get it to
slide the last inch (I even tried turning the crankshaft to get the
splines to match).  So, I figured I must have not lined up the clutch
disk well enough; I pulled the engine BACK OUT (I was quite unhappy at
this point), pulled the pressure plate, and tried again.  After
another 2 hours of clunking the engine around inside the compartment,
I got it to slide on all the way.

Now the PROBLEM:  I can't get the heat exchanger box things (with the
muffler attached) back on the engine.  The holes WILL NOT line up with
the studs poking down.  It is driving me CRAZY.  I am trying again
tomorrow morning (with reinforcements, I did the rest on my own today)
but. . . if any of you have suggestions they will be very much
appreciated.  

Either way, I am so close to driving my poor bus again I can taste it,
an I am quite proud of myself for doing all this (I had no idea how to
change the oil in any car before buying this bus).  PETE
