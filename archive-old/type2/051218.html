Subject: [T2] child's bed in 78 Westy; adding a 3rd bed...

Check out the extra bed you can add along the side of your cabinet.
someone put my bus mods on a web page for me:...parent page has all of
the following ones linked

BTW, my first extra bed was replacing the cot in front with a 3/32&quot; ply
board that rested on 1x1&quot; oak struts that spanned from across the
dashtop to nylon loops suspended from the seatbelt attachments near the
door pushlocks.  A 1&quot; thick matress was placed on this.  It all readily
stores under the poptop and in the cubby over the cloths closet.
