Possible answers to that question, depending upon your mood and your
wife's sense of humor:

1. &quot;Less than a psychiatrist.&quot;
2. &quot;Less than a divorce lawyer.&quot;
3. &quot;Y'know dear, I've been thinking of getting rid of the VW and buying a
old Porsche to work on.  What do you think?&quot;
