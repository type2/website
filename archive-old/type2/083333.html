Subject: line on dizzy or #1 plug wire?

Just started to do the valves and the line on my
distributor is actually positioned at #3 plug wire (if
the cap was on) and #1 plug wire is 180 degrees from
this line (and of course, #3 plug wire). So, do I
trust the line or the plug wire for finding TDC for
#1? Thanks.
