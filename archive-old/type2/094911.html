Subject: Re: [T2] parts place auto parts



I have received their catalog for years, and they contain testimonials from 
satisfied customers.  I actually have a catalog coming in the mail as we 
speak.  Most recyclers are 'required' to charge for the core.  I think some 
states require that recyclers at least attempt to recover the used parts 
that people will likely throw into landfills, should the business fail to 
acquire them.  As-is just means it comes without any kind of warranty.

&gt;Hello All    Has anybody out there dealt with this company before? I have a
&gt;customer that bought a new 1.9 diesel motor from them, plus injection pump
&gt;and all the parts needed to install in a westy Vanagon. First thing I see 
&gt;on
&gt;the invoice is the line saying  &quot;as is&quot;  Also  theres a core charge on the
&gt;new engine and pump.Why would this be if they are new? Just wanting to 
&gt;know!
&gt;Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  salem Import service salem Va
