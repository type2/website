&gt; OK, to get proper cooling the fan housing holes (the ones on either side) for

Yes,' on the type 4 engine with J pipes it is important to plug the two
ducts at the bottom of the fan housing that went to the heat system.

also don't forget to leave the small piece of tin that is between the cyl
on the bottom just above the push rod tubes, this one is important too.
