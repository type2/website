Subject:  Re: [T2] cruise control for bus?

I acquired a boxed factory cruise control for my 77 Safare when a  local
VW agency went out of business back in the 80's. It stayed in the box for
a couple of years before I got around to installing it, which was after I
retired in 1987.

Installation was fairly complex (for me,) requiring removal of the
steering wheel and a couple of layers of switches in the column to install
the new control stalk and wiring. It has been working fine for the last 12
years. The only problem is that the cutout switch for the clutch pedal is
practically impossible to keep lined up and working. I just unplugged it
on mine. The instructions that came with the kit were quite complete.

It is certainly worth installing if you make any long trips. It does a
reasonable job of regulating the speed. As I remember, there was also a
cable connection to the speedometer box.

&gt; Scott,
&gt;
&gt; I've got factory cruise on my 77 westy.  It's not
&gt; installed and is still in the box.  I've never gotten
&gt; around to installing it and wondered if anyone else on
&gt; the list has this option ? and if so Does it work ?  I
&gt; don't want to go through the work of installing it,
&gt; only to find it's not functional !
&gt;
&gt; It attaches on the steering column and has a unit that
&gt; mounts under the pedal area with Vacuum lines to the
&gt; brake booster !, I'm sure there is aftermarket items
&gt; that might work.
