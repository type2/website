David Eakin gives another solution to my &quot;problem&quot; (not enough gutter) with
Bentley manuals:

&gt; Go to your local office supply place and pick up a pack of 3-hole clear
&gt; plastic sleeves.  Cut the binding off and put each page in a sleeve.  This is
&gt; how most grad thesis projects are submitted.  An additional bonus - the
&gt; plastic keeps the pages clean and you can insert additional sleeves with
&gt; additional info.

More than *a pack.* Three or four packs.  And you should probably put a
little piece of scotch tape on the top of each sleeve to keep the sheet in.
But this one's got potential.
