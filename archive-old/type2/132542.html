Subject: WTB used stub axle

Anyone have a straight used 68-70 rear stub axle for sale?  I need one ASAP.
Splines must be straight as an arrow, mine is twisted and I can't get the
new drum on.  if a straight drum goes on the splines, it is good.  Please
pmail me if you have one on the east coast.  looks like used ones are at Bus
Boys for $40 but would take a week+ to get here.

TIA,
Will A.
