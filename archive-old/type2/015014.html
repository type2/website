I didn't see a reply, so:

I don't think you need to prime the lifters. They should pump up. HOWEVER,
if you do need to prime the lifters, and you'll know if they haven't primed
by now, one nice little trick I learned is to use the hydraulic principle
to prime them.

Get an old pill bottle about the same size as the lifters and a deep pan of
oil. Put the lifter in the oil; then scoop it up (and into the pill
bottle). Cap the pill bottle when it's full of oil and both are in the pan
under the oil. It will be a tight fit to put the cap on because you'll have
hydraulic pressure resisting. Once the lifter is securely in the pill
bottle, start pushing on the cap of the pill bottle and squeezing. You'll
see the bubbles come out. Keep doing this until all the bubbles escape.

This is a much easier technique than others described in literature. I
discovered it on my own, so don't try to patent the process. I'll fight you
in court and take your royalties. :) 

When I discovered this, I posted a more detailed message describing the
process. If you're interested, it's probably in the archives.

Have fun! Joe

&gt;Q: Am I going to have to take out all the lifters and prime each one? Or
&gt;will they eventually pump up? I had it running for 3-5 minutes w/ no sound
&gt;of getting quieter.
