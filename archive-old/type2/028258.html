Hi Mike,

I like the idea of running the blowers off of a thermostat so they could 
come on at at specific temp and go off below that, regardless of the 
ignition switch.  Since my Type 4 motor gets HOT going up the big hills here 
around Aspen, I have a separate switch to turn my blower on regardless of 
the heater lever.  (Plus, I think VW's solution for the switch contact is 
pretty cheesy on both the Bus and the 914.)

The main reason for the little flaps in the blower housing is not for heat, 
but for airflow.  Theoretically, the engine fan at 3800 RPM puts out more 
air than the electric motor can (even one or two of the bilge blowers).  So, 
with the flaps missing, a percentage of the cooling fan's air will take the 
path of least resistance and go up the blower hoses and out the aux fan's 
intake.  With the flaps in place, the engine fan's air stays blowing over 
the cylinders.

In my '79 Bus, I installed one of the bilge blowers, and it works better 
than the stock VW aux fan.  I bolted and glued the blower to the stock 
housing (to keep the flaps), and hose-clamped it to the stock mounting 
point.  I agree with you, though, that one blower thru each heat exchanger 
will work as well as one inline blower, and will reduce the risk of 
meltdown.

Keep us posted if your thermostat idea gets built....

Take care,
