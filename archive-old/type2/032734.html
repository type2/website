Subject: Re: clutch cable 

&gt; Volks,
&gt;
&gt; I just finished a clutch job on Rosie, my 71 Westy.  The clutch cable is
&gt; adjusted to the max and is just barely giving me pedal enough to shift.  I
&gt; pulled it to check and lube it and re-installed...it's like new.  Before
&gt; doing the clutch job I was going through cables about every 100-150 miles
and
&gt; they always broke  up front at the point where the cable was swedged into
the
&gt; clevis.  I'm thinking of putting in a spacer between the clutch adjuster
and
&gt; the stop to give me a bit more adjustment room.   Any ideas or suggestions
&gt; will be welcome.  TIA   Frank in Sarasota
&gt;

You have the adjusting nut screwed on all the way to the end of the threads
and the cable won't pull enough?

It wasn't like this before? Then it was something you put in. Either the
throwout bearing is wrong, too short, or the pressure plate is a crappy
rebuilt or the throwout fork broke.
