Subject: Re: [T2] chrome tipped exhaust (help) - correction


&gt;Chrome paint is just very bright silver paint - I don't think you'll ever 
&gt;make the mistake of thinking the paint is real paint. Might look good at 
&gt;20 feet but may also burn off with the heat of the engine.

I meant to say &quot;I don't think you'll ever make the mistake of thinking the 
paint is real chrome.&quot;

Chris
