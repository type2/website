Subject: Engine question

 We are trying to figure out what engine we have in our 1976 bus.  The
 engine has a &quot;rebuilt in Canada&quot;-type sticker that is on top of the engine
 code stamped on the case.  When we peel back the sticker a bit, we can see
 that the code starts with &quot;GE&quot;.  Which should mean a 1978 or 1979 engine
 with hydraulic lifters...

 It has the round exhaust ports and does not have a catalytic converter or
 other 1979 additions (although right now I've forgotten what they were when
 we checked).
 
 There is a sticker on the engine that says it has solid lifters.
 
 Would the rebuild company have taken a hydraulic-lifter engine (&quot;GE&quot; part
 number) and put solid lifters in it?  We are hoping not to tear the engine
 apart far enough to find out for ourselves whether it has solid or
 hydraulic lifters... thought I'd see what opinions you guys have.  Any
 other clues we should look for?
 
 Thanks!!
