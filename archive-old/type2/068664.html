Subject: metric speedo for '74?

I don't *think* I sent this out yet; if I have, I apologize for the 
repeat.  Can't find it in my sent-mail folder, though so...

Does anyone have (or have access to a junkyard which would have) a metric 
speedometer/odometer combination for a '74 Bus?  I've been driving the 
metric Jetta for so long that I'm not used to this &quot;miles&quot; thing anymore 
(though if I mistakenly get on the highway and try to cruise at 100, the 
bus quickly explains what I'm doing wrong! :) )  Do any of you folks in 
Canada or Europe have them?  (Does anyone know if they'll fit on a 
US-market bus?)  

Thanks in advance...

 - Tom
