Subject: Re: What's your word on brake bleeding tools? 
Message-ID: &lt;0.c5577831.253a6068_at_cs_dot_com&gt;

I have to bleed my braKES sometimes when i am by myself.  I take a bleeder 
wrench,
    which is curved to clear the rim, and put it on the fitting, then push on 
a 2ft long peice of 6mm fuel hose and put the other end in a clear plastic 
soda bottle filled a/b halfway with brake fluid. make sure the hose is down 
in the fluid and open the valve. go and pump the brakes several times. it 
lets the air AND fluid out but sucks only fluid back in. if you're really 
limber you can manage to pump the pedal while watching the bottle underneath, 
pumping  until there are no bubbles. keep the master cylinder topped off and 
go RR, LR, RF, LF.  I get a full pedal every time. it is more fun to have 
someone there to B.S. with and pump the pedal for you. 
    Props to Oktoberbus. much fun. we wound up in the coliseum late saturday 
night and sunday morning with rain outside. busses in the coliseum was icing 
on the cake. the Allman Brothers played on that stage in the 70's. dig it.
