X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Hello all,
  I have seen a lot of talk about t4 engines and them running hot now with
the warn weather. I have been looking in salvage yards at motors, I am
building a new one, and I have noticed that most if not all of the ones I
have seen had partly clogged oil coolers. Not inside, but outside. The oil
cooler sits level and collects leaves, dirt, oil spray, more dirt, and
rocks. The cooling fan will suck up anything and pump it though your engine.
If you have overheat problems that you just can not shake, you may want to
remove the engine tin from the top of the motor and clean out all the junk
that you have sucked in over the last ?? years. Once you oil cooler gets
partly or fully blocked your oil is not being cooled. If the cylinders and
heads are blocked with leaves and junk, they will not cool either. 
  So check the easy stuff first, engine seal, correct and complete tin,
timing, and carb settings. Then maybe it time to pull the tin and pull out
those birds nests and leaves. Remember, there is no air filter for the
cooling system on a Bus.
