Subject: Re: Unknown knob on '69 westy dash

Hi,

&gt; it's
&gt; the first control closest to the driver's door.  It is missing a knob
&gt; so there is no hint at what it is for.  It appears to move in and out
&gt; about half an inch and I don't think it turns. 

 My guess is that this is for the extra dome light in the
back of your campmobile. If this is pulled out it feeds
current to the light over the table. You can then use the
switch built into the light to control it &quot;locally&quot;.
  Your extra ignition switch is probably because the old
one failed. Other switches might be:

 Two stage (pull) &amp; turns: Headlights &amp; guage dimness.
 Two stage (twist) &amp; centre button: Wipers &amp; washer
 One stage (pull) With red light: hazard lights
 One stage (pull) &amp; green: rear screen (if fitted)
 One stage (pull): auxiliary fan.

 This last option is another possibility for your unknown
knob, it's much less likely, though, especially on a '69.

 After nearly 30 years there's a pretty good chance that
it's being used for something other than its original 
purpose!
 

Cheers,
        W.
