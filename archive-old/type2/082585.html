&gt; &gt; Hi all,
&gt; &gt; OK, after many helpful list responses and calling around to my local shop
&gt; &gt; and the tire companies, it looks like my main choices are thus:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Michelin Agilis61 in 185R14 at about $120/tire.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Continental CR21 reinforced (load range C) in 185R14 at about $80/tire.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Yokohama Y356 in 185R14, price unknown (anybody want to let me know?)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Kumho Commercial A/S 852 in 185R14C load range D, price unknown.
&gt;
&gt; 	&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; As it is I'm very strongly leaning toward the Michelin but the price on that
&gt; &gt; Continental is looking pretty decent.  Is the Michelin really $40 better?

IMO, no, but I've had bad luck with Michelins.

You should also check out the Bridgestone RD603V in 185R14 load range D.
Firestone dealers carry them (they were stock on Toyota 1-ton pickups) and
they can be a deal if you catch them on sale.  Last pair I bought were $70
each out the door.  They wear very evenly, are smooth and quiet, and
aren't worth beans in snow, so I have a pair of mounted snow tires for
that eventuality.  They also work well in soft materials if you air down,
as they will spin without digging a hole.

George
