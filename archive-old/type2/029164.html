Chad,

I am presently rebuilding the nosecone on my 71 Bus.  Ron Van Ness has a
EXCELLENT write up at (http://www.type2_dot_com/rvanness/transmis.htm)
He goes through it step by step and lists part numbers, tools needed,
everything.  Made me feel confident enough to do it myself.

All of the parts I have gotten from Weddle:

Chris Weddle
Weddle Industries
700 Becknell Rd, Unit A
Goleta, CA 93117
(805) 696-9665
Fax (805) 696-9667
info_at_2weddle_dot_com

They have been really helpful and gave me everything I need (including new hockey stick) for $75.  The only problem I have run into is in
getting some of the bushings and dust covers for the shiftrod and nosecone.  I placed an order with the Bus Depot about a month ago, got
everything in but those parts for the shiftrod and it doesn't look like they are going to be able to get them.  I think Wolfsburg West may have them.

It makes sense to me though to rebuild the entire system at once so you don't have your new stick going in 17 different directions because of some bad
bushings in your shiftrod...

Best of luck!

- Brian
71 Bus


if the nose cone is bad on one tranny how hard is it
to change.also if the hockey stick is the problem
comming out of the nose cone(plastic ball broken)do i
need a new tranny or just need to change the nose cone?
