Subject: Re: Genuine VW parts from dealers?

In a message dated 00-02-07 11:30:09 EST, you write:

&lt;&lt; 
 &gt;maybe someone as a representative of approx 1000 bus owners could contact
 &gt;someone higer up at vw and get it done easier.
 &gt;pipe dreams....... but as long as were dreaming lets dream BIG&gt;
  &gt;&gt;
I think we're too small in numbers for VW to care about. My local dealer ( 
Stohlman, Tyson's Corner, VA.) made it clear that they had NO PARTS for my 
'76 Westy, nor have they ever been able to help me out on my '74 Beetle 
convertible. And, really, with places like the Bus Depot around why would you 
even want to go the dealer anyway? Thinking back to the days when I bought my 
first new VW ( a '73 Beetle), the dealer didn't impress me much back then ( 
Lee Volkswagen, Springfield, VA.) Some dealers now don't even acknowledge 
that the air-cooleds ever existed. Now, if you told them we might buy 1,000 
New Beetles....              Jeff S.
