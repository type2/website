Thus spoke Tom Tarka of tommy_at_mp3_dot_com on 3/2/01 5:14 PM:

&gt; 3) Having flushed my brake system until the fluid ran clean, what do I do with
&gt; the
&gt; used brake fluid if the place I dispose of my oil (a FLAPS) will not accept
&gt; it?
&gt; I specifically mean in California, but general information is appreciated as I
&gt; periodically move to different states.

California is not small. Where in California are you? ( :) )

Seriously, LA County's Department of Public Works organizes frequent
household hazardous waste (HHW) collections at various places throughout the
county. I imagine most of the other counties (especially most of the SoCal
counties) have similar arrangements.

Here the link to LA's schedule:

You would be suprised how much toxic &quot;chazerai&quot; you have laying around your
house. This is an easy chance to get rid of it.

Hope this helps,
