Sean speaks the truth.

&gt;FWIW, I've had two hydraulic 2.0L engines and neither of them has had 
&gt;solid pushrods.  All pushrods in both engines have been hollow.  I 
&gt;wasn't the original owner of either, so I don't know if they came that 
&gt;way, but I also don't know why anyone would bother switching pushrods 
&gt;around :-)
&gt;
&gt;BTW, I also have a spare 2.0L engine from an early Vanagon with 
&gt;hydraulic lifters.  All pushrods in that engine were also hollow.

As far as I know (AFAIK) hydraulic lifter engines had shiny-finish, steel,
slightly thinner pushrods and solid lifter engines had dull-finish,
aluminum, slightly thicker pushrods.  Both types are hollow!
