I have a 73 Devon, except its a &quot;Caravette&quot; layout which is different;
not the normal furniture along the offside, like the vast majority of
VW campers.

It had a small kitchen on the nearside, just behind the sliding door
(and obscuring the rear portion slightly). Next to this was a rear seat,
wide enough for 2 comfortably. In front of this was another seat which
was reversible. The 2 rows of seats folded flat to make the bed. At the
rear on the offside was a slim wardrobe, and an overhead locker traversing
the back.

It worked okay, but there was hardly any floor space - which made it feel
cramped. So I changed it and made an L-shaped seat with the existing rear
seat and turning the middle seat 90°. It works really well, lots of space
inside but the seats aren't too good for passengers (the old layout was
great - 7 passengers!).

So much so that the new van I've got is going to get a very similar layout
(with the kitchen at the rear though). You may also want to check out the
Holdsworth Vision's layout (around 1986 conversion on a Vanagon). That's
got a shower room!

RE:	T2 Layout

[...]
I've got a '73 bay, with a Devon Moonraker interior. My girlfriend and I 
find this layout crap!.
I'm thinking of fitting a rock n roll bed in the rear and swopping the
interior about.
Anyone got any tips, things to avoid.
Cheers
