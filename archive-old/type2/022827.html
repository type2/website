Hey again....

I'm Sorry I didn't supply more info, was in a hurry, here it goes....

3 weeks ago my baby stopped running.
I would wake up in the morning, go outside to the bus,, turn the key, and all
I got was an engine turning over, but not catching.
I posted this on the list and someone told me to try to wipe down the
distributor to see if that worked. sad to say it didn't. =(
Now the car just got a brand new coil, points, and condensor... when the car
didn't start we tried to jump it (thinking there was not enough juice in the
battery to kick the FI) after several tries, that didn't work either (later on
I read in the idiots manual that jumping the car is the best way to kill your
FI and Alternator...doh!)
Well... I was about to give up. Two weeks later I figured &quot;what the hell...
I'll give it one last shot,&quot;..... It started right up. I sensed something
weird when I kept pushing on the gas but I figured it ws nothing.... I turned
the car off and ran in to tell my dad that it finally started, when I got in
the bus to turn the key again.... nothing.... just the sound of the engine
turning over just ilke before... man this is frustrating... I apologize again
for posting this information again earlier, thanks everybody for your help.
