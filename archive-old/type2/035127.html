For what it's worth.

I believe that comparing our busses with &quot;ordinary cars&quot; is a little
strange.  I don't use my 1970 bus as a daily driver.  (In fact I don't even
use my daily driver as a daily driver ! - I go to work on the train.)     My
bus is useful because it's big and spacious, I can move the whole family (7
of us) and I can use it for holidays and picnics etc...  I also *enjoy*
driving it, waving to other owners, even just sitting in it !  But I
wouldn't use it as a daily driver due to the fuel consumption (I live in the
UK).   My daily driver is a diesel - because of the economy.  I don't enjoy
driving it, but it does do it's job.

The costs of owning a bus ?  - well it is/can be pricey.  But it's doesn't
lose it's value like a modern vehicle, and parts are mostly cheap -
(depreciation? what's that ?) - as it happens I've spent more on the car
recently than on the bus.
