&gt; You have the chance of a lifetime! Please, don't waste it. Bundle up the
&gt; kids and the SO and put them in your bus and head out. Use your bus every
&gt; chance you get, and steal a chance or too to boot.
&gt;
&gt; In no time at all, the kids will be six-foot-two.

My 5 year old just got promoted to the top fold out cot because my 6 week
old will be taking over the childs cot.  The dog gets to sleep under the big
fold out bed.

Anyway, I have a top fold out cot from a 73 westy I'd part with for 20 bucks
and shipping.  Canvas is in great shape and it includes the brackets and
screws.

I bought the 73 after the PO lost his brakes, swerved to avoid traffic,
sheared off a telephone pole and hit the side of a building.  Didn't even
break the windshield.  I feel a little safer knowing this.
