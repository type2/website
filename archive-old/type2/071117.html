&gt; Are there any VW Bus body tricks or tips I should know before I 
&gt;  (shudder) head on out to the local body shops?

You can push the dent out from inside the car.  
I did this on a '79 Adventurewagen then brushed on touch up paint that I had 
mixed up specially at a local body shop. ($40.00) After suitable prep of 
course.  The repair was undetectable from more the 2-3 feet.
