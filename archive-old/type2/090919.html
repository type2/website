&gt; Went to the local (kinda) boneyard today and made a very strange discovery.
&gt; A 72 (clearly marked by the plate) with a 1600 DP hanging in the rear.
&gt; Has anyone ever run into this?

People will do lots to things to keep a bus on the road!

You might have a grey market import, as some late bays came with 1600
engine in europe.

It might be a Mexican or Brazilian bus.

If the engine tin looks &quot;factory&quot;, snag it!  It's not easy to find and it
is in demand for folks who want to put a type 1 engine into their late
bays.
