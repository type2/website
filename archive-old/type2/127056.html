Subject: ex-/imported a Champagne II bus

May be some of you remember that a Champagne Edition
II bus was put up for sale here on the list in early
February (it also appeared on www.TheSamba_dot_com)

I read the message simply because I was interrested in
seeing Champagne Edition II (CEII) pictures. But when
I read the price I decided to read the whole message
again to see if I understood right that the bus was in
such a good shape...

Before I knew it I was calculating shipping
prices...and last wednesday I was finally able to see
the bus in real life when I picked it up in the
harbour (Flushing/Vlissingen, The Netherlands to be
exact).

For our country the bus is in an extremely good shape.
Except for some rust under the windshield and the few
dents the car is perfect (but I was told about that
via the phone).

I made a page about the bus with some pictures:

If you have a Champagne Bus (Edition I or II, camper
or microbus) LET ME KNOW! I am interested in the
details. Also if you know of anyone in your
neighbourhood with such a bus.
