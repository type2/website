&gt; The heat has to escape somewhere or else heat up the pipe.  If you

In my humble experience most exhaust systems fail due to rust rather than 
corrosion accelerated by heat. The last muffler or tail pipe section goes 
first because it does not get hot enough to evaporate the moisture given of 
by combustion. All combustion of hydrocarbons release water. As most of my 
journeys are short trips I think its not a bad Idea to try to maximise the 
exhaust gas temperature as it exits the muffler. At the end of the day you 
pays your money and you takes your choice. Regards Mel
