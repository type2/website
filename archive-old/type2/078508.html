Subject: Re: [T2] Group 24 instead of starting batt?



&gt; Greetings list -
&gt; 
&gt; I hope all went well over the holidays.
&gt; 
&gt; The starting battery in Itch isn't holding a charge, and I'm going to 
&gt; replace it. Remember Itch? 1969 Westy. One battery total, so I'm 
using the 
&gt; same battery to start and run the lights/radio whilst camping.
&gt; 
&gt; I was thinking of putting a Group 24 (80 amp/hr deep cycle) battery 
in place 
&gt; of the current starting battery. Assuming the G24 has the cold-
cranking amps 
&gt; (CCA) to turn the motor, what problems might I cause by doing this? 
Anybody 
&gt; doing this now?

Some deep cycle batteries are rated for starting service, and a VW 
isn't exactly a heavy load for a battery.  However, the economics of 
deep cycle batteries are not good.  They cost a lot money and have very 
little warranty.  When I was running a &quot;camper&quot; battery I put a group 
24 starting battery in there and it worked fine.  They usually lasted 
about 3 years in this service, but new batteries cost about $25 after 
the 6-year warranty pro-rate.  Real deep-cycle batteries didn't last 
any longer, but were out of their 12-month warranty by the time they 
died.  $25 for 3 years versus $125 for 3 years was pretty easy to 
figure out!
