Subject: compressed air

'Lo all:
I'm in a quandry about rebuilding my carb. It's not the building that 
troubles me, it's he cleaning. After you soak the carb, you're supposed to 
blow out all the passages with compressed air. Problem is, you guessed it, I 
have no air compressor. And I don't think it would be fiscally advisable to 
buy one to rebuild my carb. Any thoughts? Does anyone sell cans of 
compressed air?
