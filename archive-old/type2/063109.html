&gt; In many parts of Arkansas, waving is mandatory. It's considered rude if
&gt; you don't wave...at EVERYBODY! **I'm serious!** You can get away 

The Oklahoma panhandle area is know as Red Carpet country, not for 
it's socialistic tendencies (don't really know) but for it's
friendliness.  Got waves from everybody driving anything and even 
walking.  We were driving a '76 camper.
