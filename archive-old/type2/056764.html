Subject: Unknown knob on '69 westy dash

The ignition switch in the steering column is the correct one.  The one
in the dash was probably installed because of the first one being bad.

On my 68 and 71s the farthest left knob is for parking/headlights.
Pulls out once for parking and twice for headlights.
