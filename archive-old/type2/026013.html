&gt; Anybody know where I can find the black rubber floor covering material
&gt; that is on the seat supports.  It runs along by the sides of the seats
&gt; and around the front of them.
&gt; 
&gt; Mine is looking pretty shabby.  I have a 72 westfalia.
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone has ideas for a creative replacement I would be glad to give
&gt; it a try.

Craig, I have the bus depot pedistal rubber mats both top and sides.  I
haven't gotten the sides installed yet, but the tops are installed and look
perfect, as close to OEM as possible, in fact I doubt you could find any
difference.  

I used contact cement on both the metal and rubber and it stuck very well.
I found putting the rolled under edge that goes along the door easiest to do
after the rest of the mat was installed.
