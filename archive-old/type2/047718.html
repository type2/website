Subject: [T2] Heat!!!

All this discussion about the Plat Cat heater convinced me that it was
time to address the heat issue in Bleu ('77 ASI Riviera).  Now Bleu
came from the factory with a Coleman forced air furnace mounted under
what is laughingly called a closet.  The Coleman hasn't worked ever...
 At least not since I've owned it.  Coleman no longer makes or
supports this particular product.  

Last summer I found a Hydro-flame model 76 furnace at a garage sale.
($25)  Came out of a Class 'A' motorhome.  Little thing...  21&quot; deep,
9&quot; wide, 11&quot; tall.  A real forced air furnace.

So, to make a long story short, after about six hours work, Bleu now
has a functioning, thermostat on the wall controlled, TWELVE THOUSAND
BTU!!!, externally vented, forced air furnace.  It's about 45 deg F
outside right now and this little puppy brings the interior
temperature up to 80 in about five minutes.  I can't wait for it to
get COLD!

So...  you all might want to check out your local RV supply.  I
understand that these units get pulled out all the time 'cause they're
too small for the big rigs.  Might be had cheap.
