 It's been a journey to get here. I bought the bus last fall. - I
 finally drove it home from my office today.

 It was only a 10 mile ride home but included both some highway and
 city driving. The bus ran great in all scenarios.

snipped for the list
 
&gt; Still some minor issues, it was very hard to adjust the idle
&gt; 
&gt; Shifting was also a bit krunky. I'll be ordering some new shifter
&gt; bushing tomorrow.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you everyone for all you questions, tips, suggestion, and
&gt; overall knowledge and wisdom. I could not have done it as easily and
&gt; learned so much without you all!
&gt; 
&gt; Time for a beer, a smoke, and a donation to the type2 list.
&gt; 
&gt; Peace!
