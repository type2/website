&gt; &gt;I think it's probably a good thing to get my torque wrench recalibrated

&gt; &gt;adjustment.

&gt; &gt;Where do I go to get this done?  Does Sears do this or are there special
&gt; &gt;shops that'll do it?
&gt; ==========================&gt;
&gt; It's a Craftsman.
&gt; Tell 'em it does not meet spec any more, and you want a new one.
&gt; Lifetime warranty on Craftsman tools.

Not sure if it applies to measuring tools.
