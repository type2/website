Subject: Re: [T2] Oil cooler question

&gt; I know I've heard that the engine has to come out to change the cooler but is
&gt; it possible to change the seals with the engine in the bus?

You have to take off the shroud to access the cooler. Lots of work...

&gt; My previous post explains my oil cooler problem. After posting it I went out
&gt; and did more inspection. It is definatly the cooler seal or seals. when lookin
&gt; in from the drivers side I can see the oil dripping off the cooler flange onto
&gt; the top of the oil filter. :~( As best I can see both seals look square in
&gt; their seats. I see that I installed the spacer rings between the case and the
&gt; cooler. They were there when I removed the cooler but I am puzzled about them.

That's the wrong place and the cause of your leak. They have to go here on
the outside under the nuts:

&gt; The Bentley for this 80 Vanagon makes no mention of these spacers, nor does
&gt; the Bentley for my 75. But my Chiltons manual does indicate that they are
&gt; needed,&quot;Types 3 and 4, 2/1700, 2/1800 and 2/2000 have a spacer ring between
&gt; the crankcase and the coolerat each securing screw. If these rings are omited
&gt; the seals may be squeezed too tightly, resulting in oil stoppage and result in
&gt; engine damage.&quot;

That sounds wrong to me.

&gt; My question is, could these spacers be keeping the seals from being compressed
&gt; enough to do their job? Does any one know what the thickness of these spacers
&gt; is supposed to be? I would like to know for sure that this is not going to
&gt; leak again and want to check every thing I can.

They are 2.40mm thick:
