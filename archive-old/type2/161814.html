Subject: 68 DC: DONE!

I finally finished my 68 DC. It is being shown at my gallery ANDENKEN in
Downtown Denver.

Huge thanks to Chris at BustedBus for his late nights helping me get it
ready for the gallery. Also props to his brother Jon who without him, It
wouldn't have any windows! A big shout-out to Tyler Travis for his
mechanical engine guidance and late nights also.

There are a few things to be done on the engine and electrical but it is
pretty much all wrapped up.
