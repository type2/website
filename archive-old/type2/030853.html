Subject: won't come off idle

Coming back from a road trip on Sunday, my 71 (1600 single port) hiccuped
a few times and eventually was stumbling and farting coming off idle,
backfiring, sputtering, missing.  Not constant - it would run for several
miles just fine and then act up again.

Made it home, drove it to work yesterday - same symptoms: ran mostly OK
but then every now and then would hiccup and a couple of times really
missing badly.

Since the problem was so intermittent I decide to keep driving it until
it failed steadily - making it (I hope) easier to track down the
problem.

Drove it to work OK this morning &amp; home for lunch, but heading back it
pretty much gave up the ghost. Starts and idles fine, but trying to goose
it past idle it will hardly come up -- a couple of really tremendous
backfires.  Seems solidly failing now, at least.

It's sitting on a side street near my house and I'm waiting for a call
from AAA to come tow it home.

Called my mechanic and he suggests possible bad points/condenser as a
starting point.  I'll try that, &amp; call him back if that doesn't do it, but
I'd be grateful for any list wisdom for ideas as to what else to check if
that isn't it.

Advice welcome.  When I get it solved I'll post back.

Joe
