&gt; &gt; You really can't beat the new Mexican engines.  Ronnie had both of mine
&gt; &gt; to my door in two days and they have worked just like new engines ever
&gt; &gt; since!  No drips, start and idles perfect, and pushes the bus and bug
&gt; &gt; just fine.
&gt;
&gt; George,
&gt;
&gt; OOC, what kind of gas mileage do you get in your bus?

18-20, mixed city and highway.

&gt; Are you running a 34-Pict-3 &amp; Vacuum Advance Dizzy?

31pict-3 and 009.  I'm rebuilding a vacuum advance unit which should
work better for drivability.  Carb works very well.

&gt; What kind of temps and pressures do you see in normal driving?

I don't have a gauge, but the dipstick runs a little warmer than can be
comfortably held.  This is the same as the previous engine.

George
