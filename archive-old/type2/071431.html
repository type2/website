&lt;&lt;John and the list

On 4.10.99 Safelite came out to install a new windsheild in the '72
westfakia. On 4.11.99 it leaked leaked like a seive.

Safelite came out to &quot;fix&quot; it on Monday. Their idea of fixing it nvoleved
slathering BLACK urathane sealant all over my pretty new seal and the body.
I looks like sh!t and I am pissed. I called and complained so now the
manager and the installer are coming out to work on Wednesday morning to
&quot;correct the problem.&quot; They are already blaming the WCM seal for the leak. I
disagree because the window was not seated properly in the frame and THAT is
the obvious cause of the leak. I will report on their next attempt to
correct the mess that has been made. If you wanna come by in the morning to
witness this redress just let me know.

I've been there myself.  If you want it fixed right, you will need a new 
seal.  What they did was glue your seal and window in place.

My windshield was done the exact same way.  The passenger side upper corner 
is not fully seated.  The problem is most likely the shape of the glass and 
not the seal.  I'ts a tight fit, so they should have pulled it out and tried 
it again.

The problem is that they don't tell you about it until they already smeared 
the glue all over it.

You better have them bring new glass also.  See if they can order a different 
brand and compare the 2.
