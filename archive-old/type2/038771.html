&gt; &gt; you don't have to find a whole new replacement stub axle. use a &quot;nut
&gt; &gt; spliter&quot; and put a new Castelated nut on, they are much easier to find&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Actually, I've had success using a O/A torch to cut the nut off the
&gt; spindle.  With care, you can do it and not damage the harder steel of the
&gt; spindle underneath...

You must be an artiste with that torch!  I wouldn't even try it myself!

The one time I had to cut off an axle nut, my father showed me a way.  You
need a hefty 4X4 or larger that is just long enough for the nut to sit
upon with the 4X4 holding up the bus.  You also need a piece of 1/4 inch
or thicker steel to go between the nut and the wood.

Jack the bus up, let it down on the 4x4/steel, so that the weight of the
bus rests on the 4X4.  Don't remove the jack, though.  Now take a sharp
chisel and use it to cut the nut, cutting stright down toward the ground.

the idea here is that the 4x4 transfers the force of the blows directly to
the ground before it has a chance to damage the bearings.

Of course, if you have a real nut splitter, it is the preferred way to go,
but 46mm nut splitters aren't all that common in my circle of friends!
