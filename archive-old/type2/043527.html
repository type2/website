Subject: WTB '74 dash and 40 hp engine parts

Hi all, 

I just got re-subscribed after trying to get by without the list for some time :-)
I am actively looking for a few parts I'll list them here.

	'74 padded dash (M511) new or in like new condition.
	new 40 Hp case
	new 40 Hp crankshaft
	new 40 Hp pushrods (8)

Any help /info on this would be greatly appreciated, I am in The Netherlands, 
shipping is not a problem, although for a complete dash, it might be...

Thanks,

Brian
