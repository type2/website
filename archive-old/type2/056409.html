Subject: heat riser cleaning... sandblasting?

Hello...

Had a great time at the NW Swap Meet at Shoreline CC on Saturday...  Was
there for over an hour.  Beautiful cars and tons of parts.. My first was
indeed a good time.

I was looking for a heat riser for my 65 bug (my 71 bus has the same) as
I've been getting substantial carb throat icing while warming up.  I was
talking with a guy selling stuff at the show, and he mentioned taking it
to a company that sandblasts things and asking them to throw the riser
into the bin to get blasted.  

Or at least that's what I interpreted.  Has anyone tried this?  I think
I'd rather pay someone $10 to blast it out than spending hours with a
flexible drill bit and a coat hanger.... Or maybe I'm overstating the
problem.

Anyway.. Thought on this particular solution?

Thanks,

Tom
