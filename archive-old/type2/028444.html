I don't know many stock T1 engine folks that run premium...heck I don't even
run premium, but I built the motor conservatively to run regular.  I run the
cheap stuff with alcohol in it sometimes.  I am planning on switching to a
synthetic after a bit more research. Any way you look at it oil changes
*will* cost more $$, but if the temp reduction claims are accurate, it may
well be worth it even for folks without FF filtering in the long run.  I
just don't know from personal experience yet.

I calculated that going from regular to synthetic oil would cost much less
than filling the tank with premium instead of regular over 3,000 miles,
which many on this list say they do.  In that 3,000 miles you've spent $200
or more for gas - is an extra $10 for synthetic at oil change time really
significant?  Not to me, and I'm not rich by any stretch of the imagination.
