Subject: Re: [T2] 7 degrees

The  big problem with troubleshooting skills is the ability to start  
with basics. I  still remember training from many years  ago in a 
military tech school for electronics.  The first week of actual 
equipment  troubleshooting was  not spent with our equipment but  by 
looking at things like bicycles, pumps, basic  house lamps, and  then 
at  a huge electronic power distribution system with  multiple power  
sources.  on  a lamp start with  the most basic item like is it plugged 
in? is there power where it  is plugged in?   If  no  power where 
plugged in why are you trying to  change the bulb?  It  is the same  
with a car/plane/rocket etc.

&gt; Public Education? lol Seriously though, mathematics while being easy 
&gt; may be
&gt; more difficult to apply to situations like this where an engine seems 
&gt; to run
&gt; like &quot;magic&quot;.
