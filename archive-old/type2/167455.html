Subject: Engine cooling air

Last summer I installed a DD air temp gauge. I attached the
sender to the plastic fan guard. I was interested in the
temperature of the air going into the fan to cool the engine.

I used to see a 10 degree difference in outside temps and
engine cooling temps. I now have a new engine compartment
seal and closed up any holes I could see where hot air
from under the engine would be sucked in. Aluminum tape
works great. Now I generally see about a 5 degree difference,
but that increases over time as I drive.

Here is what I theorize is happening. With around town driving,
over time, the engine heats up and that heat radiates upward
into the engine compartment, even with everything sealed up
tight. The fan sucks that heated air in along with some cooler
air from the outside vents, but mostly it is grabbing the
heated air above the engine. When I drive at higher speeds
for awhile (50mph+), the engine air temps drop closer to
outside air temps.

So this is my idea. Fabricate something to fit over the fan
that has some sort of duct work that leads over and up to
the outside vents. It wouldnt have to go all the way up, just
up to that area so that the engine can pull in cooler air.

Ok, you fabricators, let's hear some suggestions!

I may experiment with some flexible tubing and just use
wire ties to hold things in place and see what difference
that makes. I do have a DD CHT gauge too, so I'll be able to
monitor things.

P.S. - It recently was in the low to mid 90's here and my
       engine air temps would rise to 108F at red lights.
       My CH temps would be 350F to 380F and oil temps
       around 220F.
