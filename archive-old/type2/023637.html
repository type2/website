Have any of you had any luck with buying panels (and welding them in) from any of the usual VW parts distributors?

Is it hard?  I need to replace the rear, right-hand side corner piece, batter tray, and possibly the wheel well due to a softball-sized area of rust that's eaten all the way through, so there's nothing to tack on to.

With that said, what does one pay for a welder to fix that kind of damage? Any leads for Portland, OR?

Thanks again!

Peter
