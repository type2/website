I was on I-10 again  this time just east of Layfayette, La.  Saw a 72 or
later Westy at the rest area.  Stopped and chateed briefly.  They were doing
fine, no problems.  The couple was from Montreal.

Was this a listee by chance?  I should have stayed and visited longer. It
was a missed opprotunity.
