&gt; Ric,
&gt; Here's a trick that might work for you.
&gt; 1. pull the cable out.
&gt; 2. get a ball of string and at the loose end attach some tissue or something
&gt; that is just the size of the hole of the pipe you have to fish it down.
&gt; 3. get your vacuum and tape the hose to the other end making a good seal.
&gt; 4. pay out enough string to go from front to back
&gt; 5. locate the vacuum switch near where you are feeding the string or have
&gt; someone turn it on by command.
&gt; 6. switch the vacuum on
&gt; 7. watch the string BLAST through the tube.
&gt; 8. attach the string to the accellerator cable
&gt; 9. pull the cable through using the string.
&gt; 
&gt; Its amazing how fast the string will be pulled through the tube.  Don't burn
&gt; your hand feeding it.
&gt; 
&gt; I've used this method to feed string through runs as short as 10 feet and as
&gt; long as 400'

&gt; &gt; Anyone have some hints when the new one refuses to go in? Have all but about
&gt; &gt; 3 feet with push pull push pull. I am at a standstill and had to come back
&gt; &gt; to work for a while. I hate busses sometimes. I am desperately trying to get
&gt; &gt; this poor girl running before the High Country Bus Fest. New engine in, all
&gt; &gt; new fuel lines, fresh seals, then this. I do not even know if it will start.
