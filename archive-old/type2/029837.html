Volks,

Back in the bad old days, I used to work at the U.S. Department of Energy.
At one point, due to constituent pressure, Congress commanded us to test
these devices.  We tested not only this one (or its identical twin) but
half a dozen others.  The *best* of them had no effect, and this one is in
that class.  At least it has no *negative* effect like certain stupid
pills that you drop in your gas tank that clog your fuel filter, or the
infamous &quot;Swarup&quot; which induces turbulence in your intake air strem (so
*that's* why racers polish their intake ports... to *reduce* the air
velocity on the intake side of the engine!)

These things are junk.  In addition, as Mssrs. Baldwin and Mowreader have
said, magnets can be had for way less than $15 if you want to test it
yourself.  I think Radio Shacck will sell you a pair for $1 or less and
every VW owner has *got* to have a roll of duct tape laying around!
