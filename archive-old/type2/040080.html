Subject: Insulation Material.

I'd like to put some form of insulating material directly onto the floor of
my bus, before I cover it with plywood and carpet.
Most materials require a layer of air, and dont take well to being
'sandwiched' between the steel floor and the plywood.

What are my options, here?
Is something as simple and cheap, as tinfoil as ridiculous as it sounds?

Tia,
