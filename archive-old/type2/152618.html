Subject: Re: [T2] Oxy-acetylene welding video?

&gt; Can anyone recommend a video that teaches technique for oxy-acetylene
&gt; welding? It's been more than twenty years since I spent any time with a
&gt; torch, and I made only just passable welds even then.
&gt; 
&gt; (I know that a course would be better, but I haven't the social skills
&gt; to do that.)
