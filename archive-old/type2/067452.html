Subject: Disconnecting the air bag on a Saturn (non-VW)

Sorry to bother a bunch of you who have no expertise with this, but I
frankly don't know where else to turn.  A friend (4'10&quot;, female) asked me
tonight whether I could do her the favor of disconnecting the air bag on
her new Saturn.  She is quite concerned about some stories she has heard
about deaths caused by short people being too close as the air bag
inflates and being killed by the inflating bag.  I would like to help her,
but have no idea as to the wiring of theses things.  Do any of y'all have
any idea where to get a Saturn wiring diagram?  I hate the idea of working
on what I regard as a loaded gun without even a diagram.
