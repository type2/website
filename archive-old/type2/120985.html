Subject: Re: [T2] Hydraulic valves or solid?

Hear, hear!  I agree- and can speak with some authority with 244,000 mi 
on the stock original 78 heads!  I do check them about every 25,000 mi.
The adjustors do not show the flattening you get with non-hydraulic
constant tapping against the valve stem.   Karl said the hydraulic cam
had the same specs as the nonhydraulic, and I had hydraulic lifters
installed during a top end rebuild on a 75 - seems to run fine so far. 
Now the notion that a hydraulic case is different I have not heard
about- I assumed the lifter gets oiled the same way as a solid one?

 My opinion is that the heads are not trouble prone (the valve seat
issue has been largely solved now) but they appear that way to some
because of problems created by out-of-adjustment solid lifter
valvetrains.
