Hello List  I have used all types of swivel feet. One of the worst was from 
Gene Berg the screw part was a hex head that ended right at the nut so when 
you tightened the nut it would break the screw. This was on Tedtebares motor 
so I don't know what he did with them or what Berg said or did about them. 
Later and have fun  Mark dearing  Salem Import Service  Salem Va
