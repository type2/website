X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL - A

&lt;snip&gt;The rear ceiling panel from a 70 Sportsmobile,
flattened 
out measures:
Front:  52 3/4&quot;
Back:   52&quot;
Sides:  47 1/2&quot;
&lt;/snip&gt;
Thanks for the reply with regards to the wood headliner.
were you going to insulate under it? How about the front?

&lt;snip&gt;
Next time:  Any easy way to remember when to use &quot;My bus
and me&quot; as opposed to &quot;My bus and I.&lt;/snip&gt;

Oh boy... can't wait!
