Subject: Re: [T2] on the road again :)

&gt; If you will go to:
&gt; http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/wiring/bus-76.jpg
&gt; and look at current tracks 48-56 you will see the wiring diagram for the
&gt; turn signals.  There is a connector labelled T3a on this diagram where
&gt; current from the turn signal switch meets current from the emergency
&gt; flasher switch.  It can be located by following the black/white and
&gt; black/gree wires emerging from your steering column.  I would unplug and
&gt; replug that connector.  I understand that you have a 1977 and that the
&gt; wiring diagram for that year is slightly different
&gt; (http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/wiring/bus-77-78.jpg)
&gt; but the T3a connector is still there and I suspect it.

Yup, it was a loose connector by the hazard switch.  I was under there when
I pulled the old BA-6 timer/controller out.  That sucker was a pain to get
out, very bulky.  Thanks for the tip!

&gt; There ought to be a black plastic sheath on the cable at that point.  Some
&gt; cables do not have the sheath or it may have slid back into the tube.  You
&gt; may wish to preemptively replace the cable with one that has the sheath
&gt; and save the old one for emergency repairs.  I assure you that you will
&gt; need it eventually.

I Guess I'll have to get a new clutch cable next :-/
