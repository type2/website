Subject: Should I buy?

I want to buy a 73 VW van.  The two cylinders on the right don't run, or backfire with flame because they say a gasket is blown.  The left two run fine.  Is it really a gasket that is causing the problem, or is it something major?  They also want $450 for it, is it even worth that much?
