----SNIP---I used commercial-strength toilet bowl cleaner to eat
away the rust.  Don't let the toilet business fool you.
The basic chemical is phosphoric acid which comes under
a bewildering number of names.  It took about five
gallons to fill the tub and even then, some of the parts
had to be etched one end at a time.---SNIP----

I recommend sand blasting - much more friendly to mother earth - what do
you do with 5 gallons of a phosphoric acid liquid after cleaning parts? 
I don't even use that stuff on my toilet.  My vanagon tin came out great
after sand blasting - holds paint real well. Many welders or fabricators
offer sand blasting services.  

Don't want to be too much of a spoil sport -  I think it's great that you
guys got that bus running for the woman &amp; kids. You are giving them more
than a car, you are giving them irreplaceable memories.   BTW, Im
re-doing an 81 Vanagon Westy, and I'm spending about the same - perhaps a
little more when the new tires and the new canvas are accounted for. I
look forward to the memories that this Westy is yearning to give.
