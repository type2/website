Subject: Re: [T2] [Admin] National Disaster

Don't fall for it???  What should I do?  Demand that they sell me gas for
$1.50 when there are 50 cars behind me.  Not falling for &quot;hysteria&quot; has
nothing to do with what I am being charged for gas.  If you suspect
correlation and not causation as I did, the station mgrs are saying this is
&quot;due to the events of today.&quot;
If your water company suddenly starts charging you 5 times the ordinary
rate, will you &quot;not fall for it&quot; and send them a check for whatever you
want? Makes me thirsty just thinking about it.
Let's not be hysterical OR ignorant here.  Two things I can't stand are
liers and thiefs.  I am neither!
If the facts displease anyone, look elsewhere for an apology.

PS: Three things:  3)terrorists.
Not one fire dept was attacked either-somehow several firemen are dead.
OK, *NOW we're off topic.


&gt;Not one oil refinery has been attacked.  What this is is
&gt;hysteria.  Please don't fall for it or spread it.

&gt;&gt; OK folks, now this topic is hitting the bus community in a direct way.
&gt;&gt; Gasoline prices in this MIDWEST small town have hit over $4.00 per
gallon.
