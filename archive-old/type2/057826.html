&gt; I'm knee deep in an engine swap and I unfortunately busted off a few studs

&gt; so I was wondering where can get new ones of  these?  One end is 8mm x 1.25
&gt; thread and the fatter end is ??mm x 1.25 thread. Like not quite 10mm dia.
&gt; but larger than 8mm?!?!?!?  I was hoping to buy a stainless socket head cap
&gt; screw and stick in there to get me by until I find the real deal, but I'm
&gt; afraid of stretching out that oddball sized tapped hole in the head.....

The bolt is actually a 9mm thread pitch. You can get these from VW for
$5.40 each. Jim at the OldVolksHome has them for the same price. 

&gt; List- What should I do??  Also, any advice on extracting those busted off
&gt; studs on my good engine??? 
&gt; As always, thank you all graciously in advance for your advice.

If you can't get enough hold on it with a vise grip, try using a socket.
I've had to sacrifice 6mm sockets to get these things out before (but
sometimes you've got to do that you've got to do). It works if you have to
use it.


Hope it helps,
