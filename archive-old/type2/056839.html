Subject: '78 Conundrum

Maybe one of you brilliant puzzlers can help me out here. I have a '78
FI 2.0 motor with about 25,000 miles on it. After a long trip to the
coast (about 2500 mi.) it started to miss when I was letting up on the
gas but not yet coasting. I went ahead and put in a set of new Bosch
points and cleaned and inspected the cap and rotor. Naturally I
meticulously adjusted those little points to .016 and as an added
measure (being a FI owner for about 4 years) replaced the fuel filter.
Well, it improved noticeably but still acted like it had a barely
noticeable &quot;fuel delivery or power&quot; problem. Not being one to just
ignore it ( stupid me) I dove back in and checked the points. I also
checked the rheostat on the &quot;air box&quot; because it was a used replacement
of the original. To my chagrin it started missing worse! Contacts in air
box look great. Cleaned them with elect. component cleaner. Ok, next
step. Put in new Bosch plugs gapped to .025, another new fuel filter
plus a bottle of injector cleaner. Re-re-checked the points with the
vac. advance. distributor out. Fiddled with the timing, checked all vac
hoses,and of course checked all the grounds. One thing I did notice by
burning my finger was that the voltage regulator bottom (where that
little metal strip is) was HOT! Is it supposed to be that way? Any way
whining aside, it still runs like it is not running a consistent fuel
flow or spark. At about 2000 rpm it misses and the rpm sporadically
rises and falls. Hmmmmmm.
Any help would be gratefully embraced!!
 Thanks in advance!
