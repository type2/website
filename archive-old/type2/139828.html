&gt; okso maybe this is a silly question but if i wanted to add a toggle

&gt;  in other words = be able to add the toggle to where i could even have
&gt; my key turned on _at_ignition and not get anythign till i flipped the
&gt; toggle switch.
&gt;
&gt; shouldnt be that hard but want to make sure first.

the good news is that it isn't hard at all.  I have one in my bus.
the bad news is that this has to be a rather substantial switch since it
is carrying ALL the power in the bus (or it needs to be a substantial
relay)

I got mine from a boating supply store (West Marine) and the switch alone
was $35, in the process I replaced the wires from the battery to the
ground and to the starter etc.  mounted the switch which is about 4inches
square and three inches deep in the engine compartment.
  total with the #2 guage wire and terminals and switch etc the materiel
cost was about $125 has been fantastic in making the bus easier to start
etc but it was a major project.
  A simpler system is a knife switch that fits onto a terminal of the
battery that is about $10-15 or so don't even think of trying with some
little toggle switch.  remember ohm's law. when everything is running or
you hit the starter you will be passing HUGE quantities of power.  look at
a battery cable,  that gives you an idea of what you need..my switch is
rated for I believe 250amps continous and 400 amps intermittent.  yes I
know that the alt only puts out 55amps but the starter draw can be
considerably more for a few moments...

as soon as I get the photos scanned I will post them somewhere.


good luck
