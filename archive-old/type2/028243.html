Subject: Re: [T2] Oil pressure extension hose

&gt;however I am &quot;Concerned&quot; about vibration and metal fatique,, anyone have
&gt;any experience with this or the piece of pipe breaking off??

Hi Bob,

I used the brass pipe method of mounting the oil pressure sender on my 
engine, and I've noticed that oil still leaks out of it from time to time.  
In addition, I've had to screw the pipe in a little more and a little more 
over the past 6 months.  I usually try to lean the sender against something 
solid (dizzy, tin, injector rail), but I think the engine vibrations are 
waving the sender around and enlarging the hole.

Sounds like the flexible hose is the way to go...
