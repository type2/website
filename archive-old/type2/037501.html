Subject: flickering dome light

I just went out to the bus to get something and decided to fire 'er up
and admire my muffler replacement handiwork (bee-yoo-tee-ful -- no
exhaust leaks audible) and I noticed that the dome light appeared to be
flickering almost imperceptibly, in time to the engine. What would cause
this?
