Subject: Re: [T2] [t2] Help! Window's off the track, weather is getting
  colder

&gt;You van may require a slightly different procedure if you've got the heater 
&gt;duct on the door.


Since this came up:  has anybody out there tried building a fiberglass 
version of the vent ducts from a deluxe yet?  The plastic ones tend to crack 
and aren't the lightest things in the world.  I have one set of replacements 
that I snagged from a wrecker, but I don't know how many undamaged sets are 
left floating around in the graveyards.  Busted Bus?  Parts Place?  Any 
idea?  Maybe I'm just spoiled because it also makes one helluv' an armrest.  
:^)
