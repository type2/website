Subject: Re: [T2] lenth of stock A/C belt for 78 westy

Greg,

The one I cut off of my 78 Champagne Edition last year is marked

Dayco 15465  and is a little over 46 1/4&quot; long about 1176mm.

Beware that it may have stretched some and also be aware that
different A/C manufacturers may have compressor mounts that
would actually change the length required.

My unit was a DPD overhead unit with a york compressor.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hello Again,
&gt;         I was wondering if anyone out there might remember the length of the
&gt; A/C belt for a 78 with the stock York compressor. VWOA list the part as
&gt; discontinued but could only give me the old number not the length. Why didn't
&gt; that surprise me. I Know the old system isn't the best on earth but since its
&gt; all in tact and in good shape I wouldn't mind taking advantage of it. Once I
&gt; get the size I should be able to order a V belt at my FLAP.
&gt; Thanks
