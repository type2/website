Subject: Bad Booster, Bad Booster, Whatcha Gonna Do?

------=_NextPart_001_0000_01C25058.31ED61E0

Hey all!

I just got to Tunes the Magic Bus to pick her up from her Tank Transplant=
...That was done well. However, and here's the point of this e-mail, the =
brake booster is shot...seems that whoever owned the bus before patched i=
t with a screw in the hose (that's how I think it was described to me...)=
, and when the screw gets removed, the engine stalls...so you put the scr=
ew in again, and no stall...however, brakes are hard...(the list gave me =
the info in the first place about hard brakes)...

So how much ($$) am I looking at?

And side problem: When Mike my Mechanic had Santos, his assistant, put th=
e engine back in, he apparently wired the battery directly to the alterna=
tor...So when I went to drive out of the lot today, smoke and melted batt=
ery cable happened...Is my harness hurt by this? And if so, how much ($$)=
 is that likely to cost (although Mike will do that work for free...his m=
echanic and his mistake)?

Not a good day for Tunes. =20

TJ, who goes now and drives Whisper the NEW Beetle, and ponders whether h=
e should just get an Old Beetle to restore...But really hopes Tunes can b=
e restored.   Get more from the Web.  FREE MSN Explorer download : http:/=
