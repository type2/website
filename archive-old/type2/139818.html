&gt; I'd just like to add that there were 1.7L FI engines in VW 411's, 412's
&gt; and porsche 914's, we (My dad, brothers and I) are currently working
&gt; with a 411 engine for my Dad's project westy &quot;Franklin&quot;. These engines
&gt; used Bosch &quot;D-Jet&quot; fuel injection, the precursor to the L-Jet FI that
&gt; our buses use. Those heads are identified by a 12mm breather fitting
&gt; that is plumbed to the case breather with thick vacuum line.

I used a 1.7 1972 411 engine as a backup to my 2liter engine for years,
they run fine on the 2L L-jet FI system, as I used that when I put the
engine in the bus.
