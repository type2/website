HI All,
I was wondering if anyone can tell me what this part does,, and any idea
what value it is worth

I know there is one on my 74 Bus, and I wanted to redo my brakes so they
might last another couple of decades, so it might be a good time to pick
this up?

The vendor is not sure on the asking price, and I just wanted to be
fair,

Thanks
