guess what?  that is the way it is designed.

that bolt is probably fine.  to take it out go into the engine
compartment.  get a 17mm box or open end wrench and a flat blade
screwdriver.

put the 17mm on what looks like the upper right motor mount. (it is also
the starter mount bolt)  and start loosening it, as it gets a little loose
put the flat screw driver behind the nut head and keep it pulled tight
while you turn the nut.

that funny shape locks the head so you can turn the nut from inside the
engine compartment.

VW designers are either brilliant or masochistic depending on which way
the job is going at any given moment.  take that bolt into your FLAPS and
ask for a replacement and look at their faces!!!!

good luck
