Subject: help with bracket

    I have fabricated the bracket that goes around the bottom of the
doghouse oil cooler out of aluminum angle per the Dale Mueller home
page.  Its not very pretty, which I have no problem with, but the
problem I am having is that I can't seem to put the fan shroud back on.
If I take off the bracket the fanshroud slides back on easily so somehow
the bracket is hangning everything up.  I have trimmed around it a
little, but it doesn't seem to be hitting anything.  Any tips from
someone who has made one of their own would be greatly appreciated, or
even better has any company started making a replica?

Mahalo,
Greg
