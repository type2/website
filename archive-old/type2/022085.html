I had my engine rebuilt in July because it threw a rod (3 days after I bought
my doublecab, that's another story, but it makes me wonder about
coincidences).  

In the second week of December (5 1/2 months into the 6 month warranty) it
threw a rod.  When my mechanic got it back last week from a small Dallas
rebuilding shop. He said the rebuilder told him it wasn't under warranty
because I had some kind of leak in the carburetor, and gas had gotten into the
crankcase and mixed with the oil.  He said this reduced the oil's ability to
lubricate and caused the thrown rod with no advanced warning signs of
overheating and no drop in oil level.  He said I should have been able to tell
because I should have smelled the gas in the oil  Of course bottom line is he
said the repair was not covered by the warranty.

On the slim possibility this is not a line of bull droppings to get out of
standing by his work, I won't give his name - at least until I hear the
consensus of the list.  Comments please.  If this is real, where is there a
passageway large enough to the outside for oil to get into the crankcase if
not past the pistons?  What do I check for to prevent reoccurence?  If there
is some connection to the carburator, what do I look for?  How many folks out
there smell their dipsticks?

P.S.  While searching the old Things mailing list archive, I came across a guy
who said his mechanic said he had oil in the crankcase from parking on a
incline.  What gives?  Can we only park on level ground or risk our engines
self-destructing?
