If you'll pull a door handle, the lock code is on there.  It is on the end 
of the tailpiece, the casting on the end of the lock.  Most full-service 
locksmiths can make one for you.  If not, I can do it and overnight it to 
you if needed.  The labor involved in tearing down the steering column to 
remove the lock assembly, then operating the switch manually could be 
several hours.  Remember that you'll not only need to operate the switch, 
but unlock the steering.  Good Luck!
