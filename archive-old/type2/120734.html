Subject: Offroad Bus Trips:to MIKE(msoultan_at_csulb_dot_edu)

By far the most memorable ; Driving a 1965 bus , I went down the north
side of Mt. Lemmon , north of Tucson, Az. At first it was pretty easy
going, a couple of long muddy level sections almost got me stuck , but I
gassed it and made it through. Then came some serious down hill sections
ending in a place where the road was washed out down to boulders! Well,
I couldn't go back up , too steep , so I went for it  ,do or die! There
were points when I was on only two wheels but gravity kept me moving
forward/down. And this with a brake master cylinder with only one
resivoir(sp) no backup if it failed! Further along there was a hill used
by motorcyclists for hill climbing ,about a 1/4 mile up getting
progressively steeper and I made it more than 2/3 of the way up that,
far past 45% from vertical. The bus had &quot;snow&quot; tires on the back ,which
helped, and in sandy dry riverbads it did O.K. but in loose sand it
would tend to sink in if I gassed it. Another great ride: In Canada
there are backroads that gofor 100's of miles  with empty camp grounds ,
zero traffic , streams full of fish , but remember to bring extra gas ,
food , etc. because if you get stuck or broke down you may not see
another car for days! One trick I learned , Put tubes in your tires and
use the old vw jack to break thebead and you can fix your own flats!
Another , sometimes you can BACK up hills you can't climb in first !!
Happy Trekking !! Tim
