&gt; &gt; Need your opinion.  My sons 68 Type II requires a new engine.  Here are my
&gt; &gt; choices.  Let me know what you think.

&gt; &gt; 1.  Buy a used 1600 which is said to have been rebuilt ($1,200 installed)
&gt; &gt; 2.  Buy from source like GEX or other new long block w/ 36 month guarantee
&gt; &gt; ($1,200 just for the engine)

&gt; &gt; Also what size engine would you folks put in this old bird.

&gt; You can buy a new, new minglewood blue 1600 from Mexico...

This is the route I would recommend.  I have two Meximotors and they work
very well.  You will have to convert to dual-port manifolds and doghouse
cooling, but neither of these is difficult or detrimental to the bus.  You
can't beat new!

&gt; (I'll leave the GEX responses to others...My momma didn't
&gt; raise me to use that kinda language... ;-)

Hey, I had a GEX motor that lasted almost 40K miles.  Scrupulously
maintained.  In a bug.  It burnt #3 and #4.
