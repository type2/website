Subject: Fuel guage wiring

 
After a few months of driving around my &quot;new&quot; Jetta,
I have a hankering to drive the bus again.

I need to rewire the fuel gauge. I had ran some 
wire directly between the sender and the gauge,
but the wiring had started to smoke.

It was only 24AWG,though.

Can I just wire them direct using something like an 18 or 20AWG
wire? Isn't this basically how the wiring is done from
the factory?
 
There is virtually no chance of me finding the break in the factory
wiring....


thanks

matt
