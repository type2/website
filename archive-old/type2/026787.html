Hello listee's,

WARNING _ NOVICE AHEAD!

anyway, i went through all the manuals I could, and just looked for places 
where it might go, but I am at a loss.

I have a 76 westfalia. When you have the engine lid open, (the top one, 
looking down from inside) the top right of the canister has this smaller 
hose coming out of it, and mine is hooked up to nothing.
It looks like it was fitted over a little T connector probably, but I cannot 
find anyplace where it would be missing from.

I checked the haynes manual, and I cannot seem to find any diagrams (or any 
I understand I suppose) showing where this would hook up to.

any advise would be super duper.

Christopher &amp; Kellie
76 westy
