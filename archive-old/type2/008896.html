Hi,

The 72 has leaked at the windshield as long as I have had it. The seal was
shot and the window fogged about 2&quot; all the way around.  This was causing
havoc with my fuses and relays not to mention making a general mess each
time it rained. I tried caulking and that kept the water out for a few
months but in the end it just made a mess of things. In conjunction with the
conversion of the 72 into a camper I decided to do it right and replace the
seal and the glass all at once. 

I decided on Safelite because at least one listmember I knew had success
with them and the price was right:$93.53 plus tax with me providing a WCM
seal for Busdepot for a little under $20.00. Safelite wanted to charge
almost $60.00 for a seal.

The install took place on Saturday morning at about 10 AM. It took about 75
minutes and it was a tough job. I helped the installer as much as could
while also trying to entertain Stella. I will say that the installer was as
nice and professional as anyone could expect but I could tell that he was a
little frustrated with the bus :)

I woke up this morning and it had rained a great deal last night and I was
anxious to see how the well the install had gone in respect to protecting
against leaks. The drivers side of the bus seemed OK but the passenger side
floor was wetter then I had ever seen it!!!

 I carefully went back and inspected the seal. It appears that the window is
not all the way in at the top on the passeger side and the water is running
along the inside of the seal pouring in at the bottom right corner. Monday
morning I am gonna give Safelite a call and see how they stand behind the
warranty. It is my hope that they will make good on this problem especially
since the price and customer service seemed ok.

Any listmembers ever deal with Safelite and have a similar problem and if so
how was it resolved?
