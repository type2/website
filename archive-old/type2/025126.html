Subject: Any Volks in Salt Lake City?

Is there anybody living in the Salt Lake City area that would like to go
look at a bus for me and give me a non-bias opinion? I have a ton of photos
of it but, it would be so much better if I had a pair of eyes on
it....please contact me directly. ssoehlig_at_gfd_dot_com


Thank You,
