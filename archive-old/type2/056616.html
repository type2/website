yes, I had that changed about 5 years (5000miles) ago.
I plan to have that changed again this week, although
I tried that with the `71 bug and it didn't help.  If it is a
lubrication failure, the damage is already done.

yes, frequently

&gt;pack the CV boots?

That hasn't been done since they were off 5 years
ago.  The mechanic said they were full of &quot;hyphoid
grease,&quot; and he replaced it with axle grease *I think.*
He cleaned the joints and repacked them with &quot;CV
joint grease.&quot;  The boots are good and I've been told that 
they can be &quot;oiled&quot; with a syringe, and I might try 
that.   The only kind of CV joint noise that I'm familiar
with is the knock when they go bad.  Do they get noisy
otherwise?
