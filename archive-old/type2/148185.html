Subject: Re: [T2] Getting to Alternator Bolt on Frankinstiened 72 Bus

Rae, that pipe is held on by a small sheet metal bolt or screw like
those used on the rest of the tin. The pipe has a little tab on it
that attaches to the heat exchanger. If you remove the bolt and the
hose in the engine compartment, you should be able to push the pipe up
into the engine compartment quite a bit to get it out of the way.

&gt; there either, not on the nut.  I think I need to

&gt; without removing too many bolts?? I DON'T have a shop.
&gt; Just a driveway, so go easy on me.  I don't want to
&gt; have to remove the entire heat exchanger to just get
&gt; this pipe out of the way.  Any thoughts or ideas???
