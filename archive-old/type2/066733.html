Subject: Re: 65' bus door key question

I don't have his card, but a fellow at Mannassas Bug-Out (virginia) has a
booth where he cuts keys for you on a VW cutter which nibbles the key based
on that code on your lock tumbler.  He  said he'll make a key if you send
him a tumbler (easiest is from rear cargo door); don't just send the #;
it's a security/antitheft thing.   If # isn't visible, he'll put a &quot;feeler
key in and determine the right code for the tumbler!    Anyone know this
person's addie???
