&gt; That's not the case but I'm happy to promote top notch vendors. I've 
&gt; offered several vendors space but they probably would rather advertize 
&gt; over at Samba give the huge number of visitors that site receives each 
&gt; day.

I stand corrected. Just an opinion, but I think their money would be 
better off with your site. The Samba may get a lot of traffic, but the 
traffic to your site is strictly late bay, and probably more serious.
