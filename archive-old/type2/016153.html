Subject: Distributor timing retard for #3 cylinder

Greetings List,
Yesterday I asked which distributor worked best for fuel injection and
everybody said the stock vacuum.  Last night I sifted through my spare parts
and found a vacuum dizzy, cleaned it up, and proceeded to install it.  I
quickly learned my distributor gear shaft was installed approximately 180
degrees out so I simply switched the wires around and fired Kermit the Bus
right up. (he still didn't run worth a damn, but I'll keep wrenching until
he does)  Prior to posting this I read the archives and found this message
which I have quoted below.    
24: Some distributors do not have the #3 retard cam, and so it
25: is a moot point on these. It is poor craftsmanship to install it wrong,
26: but not fatal. 
28: Muir is right. If you install the drive gear wrong, it is not fatal.
Even
29: if you have an older VW engine where the #3 retard is important, you
will
30: be alright, as long as the #1 wire and notch align. If you can get the
31: vacuum diaphram housing to clear everything, too.
My question is ......Do I need to be concerned about the #3 retard cam on a
1978 (or so) model vacuum distributor?  Did these distributors even have a
cam and how can I tell?  I have the part number, but it's not handy.  I know
the first three numbers were 022 and the last letter was an S.  The wires
are switched around so the #3 cylinder is in the #1 spot on the distributor
now.  Will #3 have a complete meltdown because of this?  Do I need to turn
the gear around or can I avoid this?  I understand its an easy but very
risky task to rotate the gear itself.  Thanks for your help.  I'm new to the
list and amazed at the knowledge and expertise available here.
