Subject: Brake problems - please help

Patient: Stampy
Date of Birth: 1979
Sex: Westy

Patient has an exotic ailment. This summer the brake warning light (on 
dash)was coming on. I then replaced the wheel cylinders and that seemed to 
solve the problem. A month ago the light began to flicker when the brake 
pedal was depressed, at the same time I noticed that one brake light was 
out. A few weeks later the warning light would come on fully whenever the 
pedal was depressed. At the same time it was pointed out to me that both of 
the brake lights were not working. So I replaced both of the bulbs and it 
seemed to solve the problem. At first I thought &quot;golly these vans are smart&quot; 
but then sure enough a few days later the light was coming on all the time, 
but both the brake lights were working so it wasn't that. Anyways there 
doesn't seem to be any lack of braking power what so ever nor have I found 
any leaks in the system. This makes me think that there is a problem with 
the pressure sensors in the master cylinder, is there a way to test these? 
The other thing is that the front brakes always squeal in reverse and 
sometimes going forward as well. There is lots of pad left so I don't think 
that is the problem. Any suggestions?
On another note does anyone know of a BA6 heater for sale?

Thanks
