Subject: San Fran BayWindow Owners...

Hey,

Ok, so there was some talk about a baywindow campout on this list in the 
past, and I say its time to do it!

When : March 28, 29, and 30th.

Where : Big Basin Redwoods State Park. Its a beautiful park and a beautiful 
drive to get there.

Who : Anyone with a 68+ UP vw bus/van

How : email me. (cr_at_midwestbass_dot_com)

Once I round up enough people to make this happen, we can figure out if  
group site is best, or just get a bunch side by side. I checked, and if we 
get 18 busses and 35 people, it will end up being about $270 total.

That's only $15 a bus, and whole lot less per person. I think its a 
reasonable goal, especially for our first time out.

Please pass this on to any lists or likeminded folks that will be interested 
in attending.

Those without email that you pass this to, can call me :
415-781-6144

So I can log their/your name, to make sure we keep track of everyone.

www.eucasafari_dot_com - this is a personal site of mine, but over the next few 
days ill wipe whats up there and start posting more information, as it 
becomes available.

All suggestions, comments and general tomfoolery is welcome of course.... 
(again, to cr_at_midwestbass_dot_com, dont just hit reply)

PS - please forward this to the SFbaywindows Yahoo group as well, although I 
think all of us are on both lists...
