Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Double doors

Anyone have a picture of one of these buses? is the sunroof larger than
normal?

&gt; Maybe easier to import a double door from Europe. German border patrol
&gt; (Bundesgrenzschutz) had quite a number of them. Should not be impossible
&gt; to find one and shipping is only $900. A lot of the &quot;Grenzer&quot; also came
&gt; with a large sunroof. Nice combination - office style interior, double
&gt; sliding doors, and huge sunroof.
