I have a 82 vanagon with a 78 engine.  I just installed a VDO head temp
guage under the spark plug and am seeing 375-425 readings on the highway at
 65 in 90 degree heat.
I've been watching my gauges for the past couple of weeks, since someone
asked about temps.  I have an 82 Westy with automatic and a rebuilt engine
with about 10,000 miles on it.  I use 20-50 oil.  Ambient temps here in
Victoria are about 75 -80 these days.  My oil pressure at speed is 55 lbs,
25 at idle.  Oil temp max is 215.  Cylinder head runs up to about 385
before the flap opens fully and drops the temp back to 350.  On long trips
up steep hills in hot weather I THINK I've seen 425, but not so far this
year.  My bumper gets hot because it's right over the muffler (non-stock).
The dipstick is hot, but bearable.
