&gt; Does anyone on the list have a nifty way to install a porch light on a VW

&gt; Idea #1: Install automotive sidelights salvaged from junkyard. I noticed 

there are other brands, such as from a Lincoln that are actually white
side lights.

&gt; Idea #2: Install photographic hot shoes on the B pillars, and fix their 

hmmm, interesting, i think there might be better &quot;shoes&quot; than the photo
ones.


how about making something up that will clip over a door window (roll it
down, slide the light holder in, roll it back up to hold it tight) and
then just run a wire to the cig lighter???
