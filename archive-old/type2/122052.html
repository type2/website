Subject: FI vs Displacement: (was Re: time to replace engine) (LONG)

Hi Richard,

Well said. I'm not sure you're right though. I've done a lot of 
homework on VW Fi this winter researching a possible L-Jet or 
megasquirt install, and I'm prepared to back my claims.

En Garde!!

  ;^)

&gt;&gt; According to the Bentley there was little difference in power between
&gt;&gt; the 1.8 and 2L. The Bosch L-Jet FI system sets the mixture based on
&gt;&gt; air-flow, so if your engine is pulling 10% less air it will reduce the
&gt;&gt; fuel accordingly.
&gt;
&gt; Is this going to be the case?
&gt;
&gt; According to what I've read, the quantity of fuel injected is mainly a 
&gt; function of rpm at a known nozzle tip pressure. The pressure regulator 
&gt; adjusts the fuel pressure based on vacuum changes but the goal is to 
&gt; maintain a contant tip pressure because injector opening time is the 
&gt; variable based on engine RPM.

Have a look at this file:
www.texas912_dot_org/912E%20Tech%20Data/912E%20FI%20Technical%20Manual.pdf

It's a good read. I'd have passed it along sooner, but it wasn't until 
today that I had to &quot;put up or shut up&quot;. I found that manual in 
researching supporting resources for my response to your post. I'm not 
sure who wrote this electronic version, but it does look pretty similar 
to a paper manual that I recently acquired.

Page 3 tells us:
The design of the L-Jetronic allows for fewer compensating adjustments 
during the operating cycle of the fuel injection process as compared to 
the D-Jetronic.  This approach provides a more accurate fuel - air 
ratio that optimizes performance under varying requirements. This is 
due to use of air-flow sensing which takes direct account of a 
multitude of factors that influence the fuel requirements of the 
engine.

Page 4 tells us:
The major systems are the fuel system, sensors, and control unit.  The 
fuel system provides the gasoline from the tank to the injection 
valves, creates the pressure necessary for injection and maintains the 
pressure at a constant value.  The fuel system includes the pump, 
filter, pressure regulator, cold start valve, and injectors.  The 
sensors detect the various parameters necessary to assure the correct 
injection pulse duration.  The most important parameter is the quantity 
of air that is used by the engine.  The intake air flow sensor provides 
this value as well as the temperature of the air entering the engine.


So my reasearch tells us that the fuel pressure is constant... it's the 
*duration* of the injection pulse that sets the fuel volume. The pulse 
duration is generated by the ECU, which reacts to the AFM. Vacuum is 
not mentioned as having an affect on pulse duration or fuel pressure.

&gt; What if the 2L ECU is used on a 1.8L engine? We know that the vacuum 
&gt; pulled by the engine is going to be slightly lower assuming the 
&gt; volumetric efficiency (VE) of the engine doesn't change (The valve 
&gt; sizes are different so you could end up with a different VE). I don't 
&gt; really know how simple the fuel map of the Bosch L-Jet ECU is but if 
&gt; it considers the VE of the stock displacement and heads of the engine 
&gt; then there will be more differences when parts are swapped.

Page 4 says the ECU reacts to the flow of air through the AFM. If that 
increases or decreases, the ECU assumes the engine is moving faster or 
slower and changes the fuel injector duration accordingly. RPM x 
displacement = airflow. Reduced displacement = reduced airflow.

&gt; Lower overall vacuum means higher fuel rail pressure and therefore 
&gt; more fuel is going to be injected per combustion cycle than the engine 
&gt; is expecting for the displacement at any given RPM.

Vacuum is not directly related to fuel pressure except on trailing 
throttle. Perhaps you are confusing the L-jet system on FI buses with 
the D-Jet used on earlier VW's and Porsches.

&gt; Some quick calculations tell me that lowering of the A/F ratio by 
&gt; 1-1.5 could easily compensate for this. Knowing that the engine can 
&gt; operate under a variety of fuel ratios with no apparent noticeable 
&gt; change other than what can be measured by exhaust emissions it 
&gt; probably seems like the swap has no effect.

Or my original hypothesis could be accurate, as supported by the Bosch 
manuals.

DISCLAIMER:
Obviously, there are advantages to keeping systems as unmolested and 
original. But if it's a choice between that and public transit... call 
me a molester.

DISCLAIMER 2:
I don't claim to know everything. That's my teenage son's job.:^) If 
someone can disprove or dispel my arguments I'd be happy to listen. I 
like to learn something new every day, and most days I still do.

&lt;Soap Box&gt;
What people do with their buses is often a trade-off between resources 
and requirements. If Rob  can afford an NW Conrod engine he would be 
better off to get one, and keep it as stock as possible. Personally, 
the only way I could fit one of those in my budget would be to miss 
EveryBus, BusFusion, and BBTF and then work through my summer vacation. 
Given the choice, I'll drive a lesser motor and take my chances. YMMV.
&lt;/Soap Box&gt;

Happy trails,
