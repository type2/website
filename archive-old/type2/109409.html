Subject: [T2] Top swap?


&gt; I'm waiting on a guy in Idaho to send me pictures of the '71 he has
&gt; for sale and am thinking of getting it.  It sounds like its exactly
&gt; what I want.  My only question is regarding the top.  The '71 has the
&gt; smaller cot up top, right?  Any idea if the bigger bed/top can be
&gt; swapped onto the '71?



Yep the '71 has the cot up top. As for putting the later full size bed in I
see a couple of problems. First the pop-top lifts from the rear istead of
the front like the later Westies. I dont know if that makes a huge
difference but the second problem might. On the later Westies, almost the
whole roof is cut out and reinforced to put the bed board in. The curve of
the roof of the Bus wont allow you to just slide a board in and take the old
cot out but if you're creative you might be able to fab something up that
clears the pop-top when its lowered.

Some think the '71 was the best year for the Bays for the following reasons.
It has the easier and cheaper to work on 1600 engine. It was also the first
year for disc brakes up front. On the down side the 1600 IMHO doesnt have
the oomph of the later type4 engine to push around all the extra weight of
the Westy. I prefer the later bays myself. Personaly I like the '78-'79
models. They where the last of the Bay model years and had the most advanced
technology for that model. The interior layout on the '75-79 where also much
better in utilizing the space. You also get the full size bed up top. But
thats just my opinions. When you find the right one you will know.

Good Luck
