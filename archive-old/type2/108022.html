From the Bus Depot:

Wheel Cylinder, front left ('64-70 Bus) $11.95  211 611 069C OR
Wheel Cylinder, Left Front, 64-70 Bus $39.95  211 611 069C
Wheel Cylinder, Right Front, 64-70 Bus $39.95  211 611 070C
Wheel Cylinder, Right Front, 64-70 Bus $11.95  211 611 070C OR

Gary in a con artist.  As a matter of fact, based on my own experience, I'd
say 87.32% of shops with the name &quot;The Bugg Shop&quot; are straight rip-off
joints.

Subject: [T2] Brake cylinder pistons


&gt; Listees,
&gt;     I have a neighbor that recently purchased a 70 Westy from The Bugg
Shop
&gt; in Holly Ridge, NC. He also paid $300 to have the front brakes done
&gt; including replacing the wheel cylinders. After he got home, he pulled the
&gt; drum and saw that the cylinders were still rusty and greasy. He contacted
&gt; the owner, Gary, and was told that the wheel cylinders are no longer
&gt; available, but that he replaced the pistons. Gary does not seemed inclined
&gt; to refund all or any portion of the money.
&gt;     This sounds like BS to me, but I wanted to know if anyone has heard of
&gt; just replacing the pistons in the wheel cylinders. Also, if he was taken,
&gt; what kind of recourse does he have? Any lawyers out there willing to help
&gt; him if necessary?
