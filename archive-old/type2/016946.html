Subject: engine mods

Thank-you to all who reponded to my post, I got alot of ideas.  I'm
seriously considering the 2.0L FI engine replacement, keeping as much as
possible to stock specifications. I will be doing alot of further
research, but you have pointed me in the right direction.  And I would
just like to say that I am trying to preserve my westy as well as
restore it so any mods I make should be easily undone if need be.

Two new questiions: I want to be able to useand ignition systenm that
has no points, what do you people suggest.  I have been looking as MSD
and Jacobs.  What has worked for you.

Second Holly and chris suggested putting in a 5speed transmission from a
vanagon or porche.  Any experience with this?  I did not know this was a
possibility, but I am very interested as I have though of this myself.

Thanks again.
