Subject: Starter &amp; Cali Registration

Hey folks,

        This is my first post.  I wanted to sympathize with the fellow with
the faulty starter.  I soiled a few nice shirts with gas station oil smudge
trying to &quot;bypass the solinoid.&quot; Sometimes it worked, sometimes not.
Question:  Do you hear the faintest of clicks when you engage the ignition?
I changed the starter (my first operation) only to find the same problem
creeping up a couple months later.  We were then informed that the bushing
also needed to be changed for that particular style of starter.  We managed
to send back the recently purchased starter to Bosch, replace the bushing
and bang- starts right up. My hunch is that we didn't properly grease the
first bushing and the starter would get jammed in there, slowly leading to
its ultimate demise.   Hope this helps.
        On the other side of business, I recently became a member of the
ex-patriot population of San Francisco.  And like other bus owners, am up
against the department of motor vehicles registratrion policies and smog
standards.  Can someone please clue me on the necessary parts one needs to
acquire? ways around this debacle? cheap mechanics in the bay area? protocal
for registration in nevada? the fastest way to get the beast up on cinder
blocks? 

Thanks in advance,
