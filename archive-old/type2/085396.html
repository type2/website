Subject: Re: [T2] '72 Westie cracked engine block

Hi Suzanna,

Bus values are hugely impacted by two factors; condition and location. You
already told us the condition; how about telling us where the bus is.

Also, how much rust is minimal? Are we talking about small patches breaking
through the third coat of bondo and large holes in the frame (like my last
bus, a 73 camper) , or just a few brown smudges in the seams where things
haven't gotten started yet? (like my Dad's 80 Vanagon westy).


Happy trails,

&gt; Hello there~
&gt; 
&gt; Does anybody have any idea how much I should sell my bus for?  It is a 1972
&gt; Westfalia in pretty good condition.  Walk-through, pop-top, all original
&gt; interior (working sink, refrigerator, fold-down bed, etc.)  Minimal rust on
&gt; body but a lot underneath.  The engine block is *cracked*.  =(  I broke it
&gt; while tightening the bolt too hard on the oil screen.  From what I understand
&gt; the interior parts of the engine need to be taken out and put into a new
&gt; block.
&gt; 
&gt; I have no clue what it's worth now that the engine is screwed up.  It's a very
&gt; nice bus, but needs a new block.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Suzanna
