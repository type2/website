Re 79 fuel filler neck with &quot;bird beak&quot; that breaks apart:
Bird beak?  Am I missing something? The replacement neck sold by the
dealer for my 78 (rather cheap- about $20-30 as I recall) is just a
rubber elbow with a flange at the top that has holes for the screws
holding the neck to the body.
     I always fill my own tank even in NJ, HOLDING the nozzle, because 
the spring powered collar to reduce emissions wreaks havoc on the neck,
since it points the nozzle straight back if you let it hang to fill, and
can crack old rubber in the elbow and at the flange where the spring
rubs.  Ask me how I know!  MB 78 Westy NJ
