What is wrong with the filter???   It does not matter if the symbol above is
there or not, I still get it returned for over-quoting.

&gt; Home depot carries a Zep product called Formula 50--I have been buying this
stuff for years from Zep to detail the inside of filthy Mack trucks after I
had painted them.
&gt; I used to spray the headliners of the trucks and watch the nicotine roll
off-- This stuff will clean anything---honest.
&gt; There were a couple of water spots around my skylight on my 87 Westy prior
to me replacing it, and I gave the &quot;fuzzy stuff&quot; a shot of the Formula 50
and --POOF--they were gone.
&gt; Be careful with this stuff---it has to be cut 50%--and it is still
&gt; strong--it will take your breath away---but I guanantee the  headliner will
be clean---


 The Zep stuff you get direct from your local Zep commercial account
distributor is totally different than the Zep products sold at do-it-yourself
stores. The store stuff is already watered down ready-to-use. The real stuff
is a concentrate. i.e. one gallon of product X makes 55 gallons. One gallon of
the store bought stuff makes 1 gallon:)
Using Formula 50 as an example, it is sold in a 32 oz spray bottle called
Formula 50 R.T.U.  [which means ready to use]
It SUCKS as a cleaner in this form. About as strong as water.
I believe it to be 98% water......
