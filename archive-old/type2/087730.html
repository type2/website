Subject: RE: Riviera Vents

&gt; is #2 an intake that goes into the water tank? I thought it just went
&gt;staight to the sink only.
_____________________

Well, thanks for the kind words, Steve. Good to hear from another '79
owner, but I'm afraid you congratulate me too soon. I went off
half-cocked on that one fixture. The PO told me that was what it was,
but I hadn't checked myself until today when I pulled out the reefer and
heater, and you are correct--it is the fresh water intake directly to
the tap without the pump handle, which works off city water pressure.
The other tap pumps from your onboard water tank. In any case, for sure
you can get a little garden hose piece and use it to fill the tank using
the tray filler.

T. Neal says his is a drainage for the sink, but my drain is a larger
diameter hose that goes straight down from the drain and through a hole
in the floor pan. You put a bucket under it in camp to catch the gray
water. I also have the garden hose he describes, but it connects to an
external tap and to the intake for the internal pressure tap, and is
also used to fill the tank using the tray fixture. 

Thinking about it, I wonder why Riviera didn't T-valve off of that city
water intake line and hook in into the tank feeder line. Then you could
fill it by simply switching the valve to route city water to the tank
instead of the faucet. The more I see of this thing, the more I'd like
to re-engineer the systems. I expect they did what they could at the
time. I think my next vehicle will be a bare bus or van that I'll build
out myself using the updated systems. 

As a case in point, today I went to Camping World an bought a little
30.00 table to replace the heavyweight original, which, along with the
heavy rear-facing seat, has been bugging me since I bought this thing.
With the table secured to the seat (which is how mine stows away), it
takes two men and a boy to move it. Here's the table:_

I actually went to buy another one, but found that this one is a lot
stronger than it looks in this photo, and as you see, it folds down to
nothing and has the additional advantage of serving outside as well. I'm
also getting rid of the heavy rear-facing seat in favor of an
aluminum-skinned ice chest in that position. I can store as many things
in that as under the seat (especially things I'd like to insulate from
heat or insects, like medicines, opened foodstuff, etc.), it weighs
less, and also serves two purposes--seat and ice chest (in case the
reefer fails or I need something portable), indoors or out. I will get a
stadium cushion to put on top when it's used as a seat. I also picked up
a gas grill and a rather expensive folding recliner/chair. Yes, mine
will be a rough camp! But what the heck, I know it'll get more use than
anything else I'm hauling around.

I also went to a fabric wholesaler today and bought new fabric for the
back to lighten and brighten the interior, new seatcover fabric to cover
the Vanagon seats I put in, and new carpet that's a little lighter. I
got some good thread as well, and I plan to have it all installed, plus
have new curtains made, at an upholstery shop when I reach La Paz. I
figure the whole job, including materials, will cost about $350, maybe a
little more.
