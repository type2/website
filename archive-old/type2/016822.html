Subject: Shipping a front axle beam?

I have a need to ship a front axle beam for a my bus across the country
from Washington (the state) to Iowa.  I don't want to spend a fortune
(don't have one!) and wonder if there's anyone out there who can help
with some information on specific carriers, hub cities, and/or possible
private carriage (e.g., someone going that way?)  Sure would be
appreciated!
