&gt; Thanks for all your input regarding the removal of the auto tranny.  It
was
&gt; in (past tense) a 76 bus, I picked it up for $50 .  I pulled it today and
&gt; did it as a unit with the motor, then separated the two.  The guy wanted
the
&gt; motor to stay in the bus? and he told me initially that if I pulled the
&gt; motor I'd have to put it back in place!  I ended up putting it in the
space
&gt; were the middle seat used to be. I wanted the shifter assembly too but
&gt; someone had already pulled it.  I'll probably end up with the motor but I
&gt; need to find a space in my garage for it.  I was trying to pull this off
&gt; without any family members knowing I was bringing more parts into our
&gt; crowded garage but I came home late and dirty so I just pleasantly asked
for
&gt; help carrying it into the garage.  I'm slowly in the process of putting
the
&gt; newer auto tranny into a 74 bus which used to have the vacum shift tranny.
&gt; I really didn't need this one but I thought it couldn't hurt to have a
&gt; spare.  Thanks, Marcus
&gt;
