&gt;Heh.  I was once driving to work over the Sunol Grade where I-680 goes from 
&gt;the Livermore valley over into the San Francisco Bay proper, and as soon as I 
&gt;passed the last off-ramp, last chance to escape before 4 miles of hills, I 
&gt;found myself in stopped traffic (which I couldn't see from the offramp...).

I used to be a fireman at the Sunol station.  One day we had a stalled
tomato truck in the right lane and a 50ft dry van that plowed into it at
about 70 mph.  Nobody had an appetite for tomato sauce for a while.  Traffic
backed up all the way past dublin.
