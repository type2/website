Subject: Help finding a short!

(This is just a general question involving chasign a short, and a more
specific question on where to start with regard to this specific
short.)

By bus has shorted out, again.  I think it's been 6 years since the
last time it happened.  That time, it fried my turn signal relay.  I
never did find out what the problem was, it just magically started
working again.

Now I have these issues:

- turn signals make brake indicator on dash come on, but only if
headlights are on

- turn signals eventually quit working, replacing relay does nothing

- brake lights no longer work

- if you turn on the emergency flashers, the radio dies and smoke
emanates from under the dash

- headlights/taillights still work

You know, I could live with just not running the radio when the
flashers were on, or watching the pretty red light at night when I
make a turn, but the lack of brake lights and turn signals is a
dealbreaker.

Please note that nothing changed to cause all of this.  Spontaneous disassembly.

Thanks a million.
