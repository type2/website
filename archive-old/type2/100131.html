&gt; I've stripped the smaller hole in the rear of my engine case which holds the
&gt; 8mm thread bolt that attaches the rear engine mount to my case.  I've bought
&gt; the 8mmx1.25 heli coil inserts to repair the hole so that I can use the
&gt; original sized bolt, but I need to know the correct size of the tap needed to
&gt; fit the in the heli-coil.  Does anyone know?  Thanx in advance.

Hugh,

Helicoil uses unique tap sizes. I just double-checked my helicoil m8x1.25
tap with a vernier and thread gauges, and i can't match it up to any
standard taps. It is like 9.75mm, and close to 1.25 pitch. In other words,
to use helicoils, you have to buy their tap. I'd say you need the insertion
tool as well, but that you could make by grinding the end of a  nice hard
8mm bolt to the right shape.
