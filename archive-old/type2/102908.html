Subject: Re: [T2] RE: BeetleMex retractable seat belts

I got a set of  '93 vanagon seat belts from a junk yard on the east 
coast that deals in used VW parts.  I put them in my '79 bus no problem. 
 The yard is &quot;Way Out Salvage&quot; and I found them on line.  Did the Master 
Card over the phone and had them within a week.  Sent all necessary 
hardware.  Very high quality, looks as though the original owner didn't 
use his belt at all.  I got both driver and passenger sides and both 
parts, belt and clip.  I did have to drill one hole to mount the 
retracting belt roll - but it was  a very easy fix.  I highly recommend 
the retractable belt.  Cost was around hundred buck - but you get what 
you pay for and wanted to go with VW product.
