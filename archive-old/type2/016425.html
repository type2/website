       I've thought a lot about doing that, but the problem is, where do
you put all the batteries? Other cars you have the engine compartment
and the trunk, but in the bus you've only room for a few batteies at
most. This means you would have to use floor space inside the bus, which
would make the bus much less usable, especially a westy. You can't put
them above the engine compartment because the car would be so
unbalenced, weight-wise, that your front wheels wouldn't touch the
ground.
       Something the size, weight, and air-resistance of a bus is going
to have to use a 120-144 volt motor to get decent performance, that
means 10-12 12volt deep-cycles _at_ 60 lbs each minimum. If you don't care
about losing the floor space, then it's probably a fairly decent
platform to play around with electric vehicles. Another plus is the big,
flat roof area to cover with solar cells. I've seen a homemade electric
in Alabama that runs entirely on solar, looks like a golf cart, makes
100 mile trips.
       I'm more interested in converting something like my Opel GT,
which only weighs 1800 lbs to begin with, not the 3000 lbs of a bus, and
is far more streamlined, and has the long hood and area behind the seats
to fill with lead.
