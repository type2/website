Subject: Free '74 Camper in Philadephia

The following was e-mailed to me via the Bus Depot website.  I don't have
the time/space for a parts bus/project, but I offered to pass Greg's offer
on to the Type 2 List. Someone take him up on it.  (Contact him, not me.)

&gt; I have decided that I need to get rid of my camper, a white 74, that has
&gt; been sitting in my yard for two years now. I am in Germantown,
&gt; Philadelphia, and the bus is yours (or anyones) for the asking. The engine
is broken
&gt; down in the garage, as I was tearing it down for a rebuild. The body is in
&gt; okay shape, but has a rusted out front axle. Let me know if you are
&gt; interested.
