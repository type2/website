Subject: Re: [T2] Trans gear oil replacement

&gt; Can someone tell me where the gear oil fill opening is on a 71 transmission, and how do I get the oil in there (I assume it's on top of the transmission). After exensive archive research I found that I should use GL-4 90 weight oil, but not the specifics of changing it.  I also had no luck finding this info in my Bentley.

it is on the side of the tranny, uses a really big allen wrench to remove.

oil goes in until it just reaches the fill hole

I use a enema syringe to put the oil in.  cheap at the local drug store,
and you get the enema as a bonus, of course a used one works just as well
when cleaned ;8*?
