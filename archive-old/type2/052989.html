Subject: elec. gurus - oil light circuit Q

I am attempting to add a buzzer to my oillight circuit, so's I can actually
WATCH THE ROAD and NOT the light whilst driving :)
I ASSUMED (I am an ass... U?) that I could merely wire my -currently
disconnected - doorbuzzer in betwixt sender and light, but no go. A), I
think it draws too much power for the circuit, B) it ain't that kinda
simple, on-off buzzer - it baffled the recording studio guys next door!
They finally insisted that &quot;VW isn't giving you the whole wiring diagram of
that buzzer&quot; and huffed off.

Next I went to Radio Shack and got a lil 12v. 10Ma beeper. Stuck it in
between sender and light. Nada; same for AFTER light, but before ground.

Any suggestions?
