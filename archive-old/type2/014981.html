1-Can anyone help me find the little cap for the westy stove burner that
makes the flame a circle.  It is a loose part that just sits on top of the
flame.  I have one and have not been able to find a second for my other
burner.

2-I want to refurbish my westy camper windows but the only seals that I can
find are the ones that seal the window to the bus.  Does anyone make a seal
kit for the little awning windows?  Or screens for them?

TIA
