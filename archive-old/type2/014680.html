Regarding the choking FI Westy. If you have problems
with FI, it is often bad, or dirty electrical connectors.
Wiggle all the electrical connectors including the octopus of grounds
that are hidden under the air distribution box on top of the engine. 
These hook to a multi pronged thing on one of the engine case bolts on the
top center of the engine case.
Check the temp sensor on cylinder 3 is tight. Remove and clean threads
to ensure a good ground connection there.
My van does this every time I drive it to its winter storage. I think 
it just likes to give me something to worry about all winter wondering if it
will start
in the spring. It always does though.

About the 1/2 engine not working.
You changed too man things at once. Get out your time machine
and back out of some of the changes. Can you pop the old
distributor back in and try it?
BTW regarding the new condenser, I once went for a long walk
when a NEW condenser turned out to be bad.
