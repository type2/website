Knowledge is power? I 'tis a 'German' car





[T2] Announcement: i405_dot_com will no longer be hosting Archives,
asked   to remove

Because of the my suggestion that I wanted to see if people think it is
OK
to get CD-ROM or ZIP copies of the archives...

Ken Hooper, one of the Type2 admins,  has told me to take down my
archives
of the Type2 list.

I don't fully understand his reasons, but I understand what he is
asking.
So I will be taking down the archives.

I'm glad all my hard work was a waste of time.  Including my discussions

with Ken.
