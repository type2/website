Subject: Re: [T2] VW CD's??

Are we talking about ETKA?

ETKA has been in circulation for sometime.

Look around - you'll find it.

Don't pay $10 for questionable software...

The ETKA software list all the parts manuals for everything VW from 1949 to 
current - or as current as that particular copy of the software is. Don't 
know if VW would have a fit about this catalogs or not being in circulation.

&gt; &gt; It appears that someone has gotten their hands on &quot;official&quot; VW parts

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Does anyone know if these are being widely distributed and how legit 
&gt; they are?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Just curious- I am surprised that VWOA doesn't already have a team of 
&gt; lawyers on their case
