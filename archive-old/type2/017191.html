 Hi!!.

I don't think it's a stupid idea. It sound logical, remember that cold
temperatures make things to shrink.  In special shops, some parts are submerged
in very hot tanks with water to take water seals off from water cooled heads and
blocks.

So I agreed with Bill, give it a try and put the _at_#&amp;*! crank in the freezer.

&gt; This may sound stupid, but put your crank in the freezer over night then try
&gt; putting the gear on. I have a wooden mallet I use to help it along sometimes.
