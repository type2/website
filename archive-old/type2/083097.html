Subject: RE: POR-15

por15 works great IF you put it on exactly as the
directions state.  i have had it on the bottom of my
bug for years and the only thing that has taken it off
was where i got my clutch tube replaced and the torch
melted a bit off, other than that, the stuff has been
bullet proof for me.  the pan/trunk kit is probably
your best bet out there to fix anything.  i just
bought my bus and i'm planning on doing the whole
bottom inside of the doors before i kool patch the
insides and i've already done the windshield rim.  it
fixed up the small holes real nice with the por-15 mat
that came with the kit. they even make some mat that
can be used with the high temp paint so one could fix
holes in heat exchangers as well as these bus heat
exchangers are quite expensive new.
