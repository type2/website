Subject: Shisft lever problems

Hello guys

I have a problem with my shift lever mechanism, I have been experienced some
dificultd to engage the first a second gears, even in stop possition, I
dissasemble the lever and found that the pin in the bottom part of the lever
is free (you can take it out very easy, is it normal?), I check for the rear
couplr and is O.K, I have olso the gizmo that reduce
 the travel of the lever, a kind of spacer that is betwen the floor and the
plate and the .

As usual any input will be appreciate

From the sunny lands of Caracas Venezuela
