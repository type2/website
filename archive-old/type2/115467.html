Subject: Re: [T2] parts cleaning tank recommendations?

  I aquired my Allied washer at the once-local Pep Boys.  I use Brakekleen 
in the washer.  Buy it by the gallon.  It will not flashover, and it 
eventually evaporates.  All I have left is a bunch of sludge to wipe out and 
discard. YRMV.

Eron
