Subject: Re: Help with push rod tubes -Reply

Just so our pushrod replacer is not misled, the heads DO NOT have to
come off when replacing the tubes on a 2.0L engine.  I did it just fine
without removing the heads.  On a '65, they do have to come off but on a
2.0L, the tubes twist out thru the heads.  I like that design a lot better.
