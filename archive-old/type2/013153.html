Subject: Propane tank for sale

List,
The propane tank under my 71 adventurewagen is still holding propane.

The stove, etc was all gone when i got it, so i won't need it.
Not sure if it will fit exactly on later campers - probly wouldn't be much of
a mod if it didn't...

Closest price i can find new is for the 80-91 vanagons and its $285 (!) but i
don't want anywhere near that for this part.
Prior to 1980, i think they're NLA.  This was a california bus originally. 
Might have spent the last 10-15 years in the IN area - at least the last five
off the road.

Not looking to 'gouge' anybody, but i am financing a resto (term used loosely)
on this bus - http://www.angelfire_dot_com/ky/fecesdiary/71.html
No engine, brakes need work, water damage to interior, tranny rebuild...

Just think about the breakfasts you could have...

If i can get a hundred bucks i'd be more than happy to pull it, clean it and
ship it for free.
