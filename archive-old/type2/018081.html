&gt; I am a graphic designer working in the Midlands of the United Kingdom and I
&gt; love the lines, colours and character of bugs, ghias and buses.

I also love the lifestyle and frienship attatched to the scene. Ther'es
nothing better than a good weekend show, waking up to the sound of more v-dubs
blustering their way into the field and cooking breakfast outside.

My partner, Steve, and I own:

- a '72 Bay Window Microbus deluxe - &quot;Ektor&quot; our camping companion and beloved
home from home. He has a home-made (previous owner) interior of grey ash and a
bostin' Cd sound system (us);

- a '72 Bug - &quot;Joni&quot; (Big Yellow Taxi) who is always pointed out, smiled and
waved at by kids - much to the dislike of their Ford or BMW owning dads! Our
grandson calls her the &quot;La-La car&quot; after the teletubby, and we have a stuffed
La-La doll attatched to the back of the rear-view mirror. Yesterday a little
girl in the back of a Land Rover discovery waved at us and held up he &quot;Po&quot;
doll to wave too!;

- a '72 Karmann Cabrio - &quot;Helga&quot; (The Topless German Model) who we are dying
to get out in now the weather is better, but who keeps on throwing up problems
as she was bodged by the previous owner;

- a '63 Karmann Ghia - in progress and yet to be christened! A California LHD
import waiting for some TLC  and spare time! Just got her some blue leather
seats from a scrap Jaguar for £15!;

- a '72 donor Bug &quot;Dennis&quot;, who lives on the patio and was to be the project
before the Ghia came along - now for sale! Good, basic 1300 bug, tax-exempt
and needing an engine (could supply) a snip at £350! If you are interested
p-mail me on g.dunkerley_at_mac-1_dot_net

Love from Gillian
