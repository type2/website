Subject: Re: [T2] AIRS request

I've only met susan a few times, but I doubt anything shes driving across
country is the broke down wreck alot of folks are under the impression she
is in. Shes not a flat broke &quot;I bought my bus for $50 and I'm gonna drive it
around the world&quot; type. She seems like a pretty organized, and generally
together lady. Plus I can't imagine she would leave that sweet running split
dormobile shes always blazin by me on the highway in to drive a clunker so
far.
 As for continuing on to a friendly place w/ work space and  free access to
tools, I just don't see a thing wrong with it. If the bus will make it there
safely, that seems much better than being at the mercy of an unknown shop
who knows you'll be leaving the state when they're done. Thats what that
list is for.
