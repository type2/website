Subject: [T2] stability of timing

I had occasion to check my timing today.
At full throttle, the reading on the degree pulley was fairly stable and I
set timing for 28 degrees.
At all lower rpms, the reading danced around and I couldn't guess a reading
to within +/- 5 degrees.

This was for a never used 009 and a Petronix which I installed yesterday.

Could be my timing light, I guess. Or could be a defective distributor.

My question:  Can anyone report rock steady readings at all rpms?  If so,
any secrets for achieving this?

Jack
