Subject: Re: [T2] Autoclub?

i must say i have had good luck with triple A myself. 
but then again it seems i know most of the tow truck
drivers by name:)  triple A plus membership will give
you 100 free miles towing which can be nice and i have
used my full 100 before, luckily not with the bus
though(knock on wood)  my brother in laws friend once
used them to tow their car home from the bar when they
were drunk...but i guess thats more of a friday
thing...
happy new year everyone!

&gt; It depends upon you.  If you find that you need

&gt;  I've probably lost
&gt; money over the the years, since I've only needed one
&gt; tow in 20+ years.
&gt; The maps are nice, the tourbooks are useless (IMO)
&gt; and in california the
&gt; fact that they handle DMV services is very nice. 
&gt; Their insurance is
&gt; overpriced.  They have an unfortunate tendancy to
&gt; support any new law that
&gt; might improve their insurance company profits, such
&gt; as those that
&gt; discourage the use of older vehicles.
&gt; 
&gt; The best &quot;auto clubs&quot; for the bus owner are
&gt; NEATO/LIMBO and AIRS.  It's
&gt; much more comforting to call upon someone who knows
&gt; your vehicle and local
&gt; sources for its needs than somebody who considers a
&gt; VW bus &quot;weird.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Any comments on using autoclubs?  Is Tipple-A the
&gt; best deal, or should I
&gt; &gt; look at others?
