Subject: pump sinks:  an addendum
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.SOL.4.02A.9811241439010.15484-100000_at_insci14.ucsd_dot_edu&gt;


Sorry to do this, but in my last message about sinks, I implied that the
Bus Depot sold a pump sink GASKET, whereas what I ment to say is that they
sell, for $40, a whole new pump sink.  Naturally what I was trying to say
is that I wanted to get just the gasket that I need rather than trying to
replace the whole sink just because my old gasket is used up.  Sorry for
the mix-up.
