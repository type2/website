Subject: RE: nice find

&gt;These busses have to be quirky too, no?

Would you like the quirks listed alphabetically or just off
the top of my head?

Quirky or not though, IMHO vw buses (or any air-cooled vw,
for that matter) are well worth putting up with the quirks.
I guess the trick is to find a bus that has the least number
of quirks when you get it ;)

My personal experience with buses is limited to my current
daily driver (a '70), and my previous daily driver (a '75).

Here are a few &quot;quirks&quot; I believe are common to most pre-fuel-
injection buses...

1. Oil leaks (easy to fix, but they always seem to come back)
2. Electrical problems (directly proportionate to the age of
the bus and the number of previous owners)
3. Heat &quot;issues&quot;
4. Engine fires (as the list says, &quot;replace and clamp dem hoses!&quot;)
5. Valve #3 (almost always a trouble maker)
6. The &quot;Herbie Factor&quot; (each bus has its own personality --
some are mischievous, some are cooperative, some are down right
stubborn -- unfortunately, it's hard to tell what yours will be
like until you get it home ;)

I'm sure the others here could add to this list. Also, keep in
mind that each bus will have its *own* set of quirks, depending
on its condition and the skill/finances/patience/dedication of
its previous owners. I don't want to give you the impression
that buses are money pits (though they can be), but be prepared
to spend a fair amount of time tinkering.

Anyways, hope you find a great bus...
