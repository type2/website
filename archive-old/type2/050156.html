I used to run my 71 bus in zero to ten degree weather all the time. 
It had a good engine seal, a working thermostat and air intakes wide
open.  Engine ran great and it produced enough heat to deice and
defog the windows. Don't see the need to plug the air intakes and
install an oil temperature gauge for winter driving.

&gt;&gt;	Hej!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Must disagree with John here. Volkswagen sold covers for the air 
&gt;&gt;intake
&gt;&gt;openings, at least for the bugs. They didn't cover the air intakes
&gt;&gt;compleatly and they had adjustable flaps. The covers vere made of 
&gt;&gt;the same
&gt;&gt;type of rubber/plastic used on the floor inside the car. Duct tape 
&gt;is
&gt;&gt;indeed easier to find these days :-)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;A trick I have seen on both busses and bugs is a large &quot;skid plate&quot; 
&gt;&gt;mounted
&gt;&gt;under the engine to prevent the engine from the cold wind under the 
&gt;&gt;car.
&gt;&gt;Don't know if they were  original VW accessories. The thin metal 
&gt;&gt;plate was
&gt;&gt;as wide as the engine and was attached to the body rather than the 
&gt;&gt;engine. 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Whatever you try, don't try it without an oil temp meter.

&gt;&gt;That's what the thermostat and flaps are for, not duct tape.
