Fabulous idea.

&gt;I would like to
&gt;get the best milage possible so I know I will need to lean it out.  What
&gt;are the boundary CO readings that will give me the best milage without
&gt;running the engine too lean?  I don't know if it's possible, but can you
&gt;burn-up/overheat your engine if it's overly lean?

Yes, if it's run hard.  I would not feel safe running an air-cooled engine
richer than 13-to-1.  13.5 or even 13.75 would be acceptable for most cars,
but I'd give yourself a safety margin with a bus engine.

&gt;Also, has anyone tried using a K&amp;N airfilter on their intakes?  I was
&gt;reading a site linked off of TYPE2.COM and it mentioned that a K&amp;N
&gt;filters gives much better airflow than the stock filter.  Any words on
&gt;this?

Yes, they are great.  I concur with Robb wholeheartedly on this and would
run one on my bus in a second if I could find one that fit.
