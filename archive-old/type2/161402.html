Subject: Paul Vruggink wants to chat

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Paul Vruggink wants to stay in better touch using some of Google's coolest
new
products.

If you already have Gmail or Google Talk, visit:
http://mail.google_dot_com/mail/b-98e765f4d3-a613437fcf-0f5f859da5bddd55
You'll need to click this link to be able to chat with Paul Vruggink.

To get Gmail - a free email account from Google with over 2,600 megabytes of
storage - and chat with Paul Vruggink, visit:
http://mail.google_dot_com/mail/a-98e765f4d3-a613437fcf-0e30f36345

Gmail offers:
- Powerful spam protection
- Built-in search for finding your messages and a helpful way of organizing
  emails into &quot;conversations&quot;
- No pop-up ads or untargeted banners - just text ads and related information
  that are relevant to the content of your messages
- Instant messaging capabilities right inside Gmail

All this, and its yours for free. But wait, there's more! You can also get
Google Talk:

http://www.google_dot_com/talk/

Its a small Windows* download that lets you make free calls to your friends
through your computer. It's simple and clutter-free, and it works with any
computer speaker and microphone.

Gmail and Google Talk are still in beta. We're working hard to add new
features
and make improvements, so we might also ask for your comments and suggestions
periodically. We appreciate your help in making our products even better!

Thanks,
The Google Team
