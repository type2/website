&gt; After weeks of waiting, I have my bus.
&gt;
&gt; I went up to San Jose from Fresno yesterday to pull it out of the weeds
and
&gt; hopefully get it running so I could drive it back today.
&gt;
&gt; After realizing that the only thing preventing it from starting was an
empty
&gt; gas tank (yes, I'm a genius, that only took about an hour) I baked it out
of
&gt; it's pomegranate tree cocoon and commenced washing off five years of gunk
&gt; from the inside and helping the PO's remove 5 years and 2 teenagers worth
of
&gt; athletic equipment.
&gt;
&gt; There is really no rust that I can find.  A bit of surface rust here and
&gt; there, but nothing like what I'm used to (Washington, DC - East coast
rust)
&gt; After an oil change (it was pitch black and smelled like...guess) and some
&gt; air in the tires and a few gallons of new gas, we took her out for a spin.
&gt;
&gt; It's been a long time since I grappled with no power steering - I thought
my
&gt; 71 Land Cruiser with 36&quot; tires was hard to steering without power
steering -
&gt; man!
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, after my meeting today we set off back to Fresno.  I had no
&gt; expectations.  The bus (with stock 1700 and dual carbs) was running well
&gt; enough.  The idle was a little off, and the lights in the rear were
&gt; intermittent, not to mention some kind of exhaust leak somewhere , I
think,
&gt; so I wasn't sure whether or not I would make it back, and had my AAA card
&gt; ready to go.
&gt;
&gt; Well, I expected a typical holiday San Jose wait down the 101, but was
&gt; surprised by very light traffic.  How great, I thought.
&gt;
&gt; I was unprepared for what lay ahead.
&gt;
&gt; 10 miles of bumper to bumper traffic to get to the mountains took 2 hours.
&gt;
&gt; She never missed a beat.  I was stunned.
&gt;
&gt; Once we got to the mountains, I had to grapple with the first 4 miles of
&gt; straight up, and , as expected, did the whole 4 miles at around 30-35 mph.
&gt;
&gt; My fiancée, who was following me is our Toyota Pickup, thought the whole
&gt; thing was terribly amusing.
&gt;
&gt; Either way, We made it up the hard part, and after that it was smooth
&gt; sailing at around 70 mph the whole way to Fresno.
&gt;
&gt; The only problem I had was some fuel spillage around corners - unknown
&gt; source - probably filler tube is rotten or vent tube is missing/broken,
and
&gt; severe, hot, heavy white smoke the pours from the passenger side intake
&gt;  think?) on the back pillar. The two are no doubt related. Smell like oil
or
&gt; something burning, but I can't tell - any ideas?  Regardless, first
purchase
&gt; tomorrow will be a new fire extinguisher.  ;)
&gt;
&gt; If you are in or around Fresno, drop me a line. I need to get a couple
&gt; things (interior pieces and front tire cover) and need to know good
sources.

We will be crusing up* from San Diego* to San Francisco toward the end of
this week.  Running-in  a new 1776cc that was just installed in the * Free
Bus* 71 Westy, and , delivering a new long-block &amp;*Scat* fan shroud, to San
Jose.

 Let us know what you want and/or if any other list members have anything
needing to be sent North in California, p-mail us.
