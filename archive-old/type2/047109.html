The cot consists of fabric and two bars with hook ends that fit into slots
on the front and rear door posts allowing the cot to hang across the front
seats.

&gt; hey volks,
&gt; ive got an easy one for you this evening.   i recently
&gt; got ahold of a childs cot out of a 68 westy and
&gt; decided to play with it a little and see how it
&gt; worked.  im not sure if i read it somewhere or heard
&gt; it somewhere but i assumed (i know) that it went
&gt; between the front doors?  well i unrolled it and it is
&gt; too small to fit.  where does this thing go?   ive got
&gt; a 73 riviera but the dimensions of the bus are
&gt; obviously the same.  help a mentally challenge guy
&gt; out:)
&gt; thanks everyone
&gt; shelby
&gt; 73 riviera &quot;lizzy&quot;
&gt;
&gt; ps- glad the headlight assemblies worked out chris
