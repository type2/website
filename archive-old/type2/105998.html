&gt;BF Goodrich All Terrain T/A K/O 27x8.5 max load 1515		$89

I replaced a set of passenger car tires on my '78 Westy with these, and so 
far they've been great.  I have never noticed any excessive road noise with 
them, and when it snowed more than usual here they were fantastic.  Also, 
they look great.  As sad as this seems, I will probably keep them for their 
looks in spite of their drawbacks.  They are bigger and do effect your gear 
ratios quite a bit, and in my experience it's not for the better.  I need 
lower gears if anything.  I'm sorry I can't comment on their most important 
quality, which is handling, as I recently found out that all of my wheel 
bearings are loose, and have been for some while (since I had the tires).  
Hope this information helps!
