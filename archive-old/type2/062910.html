Subject: brake caliper rebuild??

Hi all
As I was installing my new front shocks (not because I could
actually feel the benefit of them since my van is currently
garage bound) I noticed severe ruts in my rotor. Upon further
inspection I realized that the brake pads were all but gone.
This is on the front of my '74 bus.
So I move to the other side and the pads and rotor look good.
At this point I ask myself :&quot; Hmmm, I wonder why the left
side is not affected?????&quot; So as I am pondering this and
replacing the road wheel on the right side (the worn side)
I notice that although no one is pressing on the brake,
the wheel has a good amount of resistance to turning. SO 
it apperars that my caliper has somehow stuck shut and 
destroyed my rotor. I looked in my RMMW catalog and a new
caliper is YIKES!! $179. They do offer a &quot;rebuild&quot; kit for
the caliper for about $20. Has anyone rebuilt a caliper
or have any advice on this subject?????? Thanks to all.....--
