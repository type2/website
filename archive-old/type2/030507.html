hi all,

as i may have let everyone know my 71 bus has been popping out of fourth a
bit for a while now... i figure its about time to go ahead and put in a
new transaxle rather than end up stranded somewhere.

i have acquired a 78 transaxle but havent quite decided if the 1600 dp can
handle the extra tall gearing or not...
(i know i'll have to swap the input shaft and bellhousing from my 71 trans
to make it fit, but thats not such a big deal)

so, if anyone has any input i'd certainly appreciate it. (i think i've
decided to go ahead and try it and see what happens...)

thanks,

Steve
