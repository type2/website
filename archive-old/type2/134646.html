Subject: Re: [T2] ba6 heater and the 55 amp alternator.

&gt;but am now concerned about maxing out the available
&gt;amperage from the stock 55 amp alternator.

You dont have to upgrade your alternator, I have a BA6 in my bus and usually 
run dual LCD monitors, a DVD and a mini fridge on my long trips.

I have tested the output of the alt with everyting on and its within acceptable 
range.

I wouldnt worry about it unless you want to use a 1500W invertor and a killer 
stereo too....
