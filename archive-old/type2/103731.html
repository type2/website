Subject: Re: [T2] Remove engine AND tranny?

typo in previous message, sorry

&gt; &gt; always the last 2 inches, this is not an issue if the engine and trans are
&gt; &gt; already together. The other advantage is that the entire engine, I mean
&gt; &gt; everything, stays with the engine for the install/pull taking the tin off
&gt; 
&gt; also with the auto tranny the linkage is different and can be screwed up
&gt; really easy with the tranny ATTACHED, and it is very NLA (most pieces)
