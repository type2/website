&gt; I was looking around for some data on Oil temp readings, I recently

&gt; What is Normal operating temp, what is the high end shut down now temp.
&gt; any body have a link to some of this kind of data?


depending on the weather I usually see 190-230 as normal, at 240 I start
driving cooler (at speeds I know will help cool the bus engine) and at 250
I start looking for a safe place to pull over.

now unless there is a mechanical fault I don't think it wise to shut the
engine off if you can cool it.. I have been known to open the engine door
all the way to make it easier to get more air flow when I'm NOT driving.
there is a lot of discussion over weather this is good or bad because it
is easier drawing or pulling from near the muffler issue so YMMV but that
is how I do it.
