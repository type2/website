&gt;&gt; I can't remember the exact difference in the composition, but Brazil 
started to make their cases with the AS21 designation to distinguish against 
the AS41 Mexican cases.  A different ratio in aluminum and magnesium between 
the two cases.  And the experts seem to be in agreement that the AS21 is a 
better case.  

 ... just a sec....  OK, found it. 


From the ASM Metals Handbook, V.2, 10th edition, 1990

Room Temperature properties:

AS21            1.7% Al
                .4% Mn
                1.1% Si
                240 MPa Tensile Strength
                130 MPa Tensile Yield Strength
                130 MPa Compressive Yield Strength

AS41A           4.3% Al
                .35% Mn
                1.0% Si
                220 MPa Tensile Strength
                150 MPa Tensile Yield Strength
                150 MPa Compressive Yield Strength

&quot;AS41A has creep strength much superior to that of AZ91D or AM60B alloys at
temperatures up to 175C (350F)... AS21 alloy exhibits even better creep
yield strengths, and it is somewhat more difficult to cast.&quot; &lt;&lt;
