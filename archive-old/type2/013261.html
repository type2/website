Mime-Version: 1.0

A little addenum to the T4 rebuiling tirade.  I picked up a copy
of the little &quot;without guesswork&quot; book off *bay for $5 the other
day and really like the little thing.  This one is a '71-'74 edition
and has all specs for T1,2,3,4 manufactured during those years.
Basically all the spec sections from the ends of the Bentley
chapters for all of those cars, any model, for those years and
specs from the owners manuals for dimensions, etc.

It's neat.  I'd have liked to have come by one that goes to '76
and would trade this one to anyone who might have one
covering that late to get the 2.0 engine stuff as I don't really care
for the T1,3,4 specs, but it is still a cool little book.  I'd been
meaning to pick one up for a long time, finally seemed $5 was
hard to beat.  For a quick reference for inspecting parts or
assembling an engine, this thing is cool, let alone all the other
stuff from alignment data, to gas heater specs, to who knows
what all else.  Pick one up for your favorite years at a swap
sometime folks.
