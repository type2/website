I just ran out to the car to check it over.  Still have all the spark plu=
gs.  checked the oil.  Little more than half what it should be! even thou=
gh I had just filled it a short while ago. Don't have a compression check=
er.  Went to buy one, but they had a couple different types for testing d=
ifferent things.  Not sure which I need.
When I looked on the drivers side front of the engine (front means front =
of the car) There was a lot of oil in the compartment and the spark plug =
is all oily.
Guess I gotta find a place to bring it in to be looked at.  Wasn't happy =
with the last place I took it less than 2 weeks ago.  He was supposed to =
have done a thorough inspection, but it looks like he missed a couple thi=
ngs.  Especially since he didn't even listen to it run.
Don't know if the oil in the compartment helps with the diagnoses.
Thanks,
Kyle

Praying that the problem is inexpensive.
