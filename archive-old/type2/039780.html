Subject: Re: What's the matter with ArmourAll?

  What's the long term downside and do you know of a
&gt; product that cleans/shines like that stuff, but doesn't do the bad stuff?
&gt;
    It is my understanding that armour all does not have a SPF sun screen
additive therefore causing the dash to age more quickly in direct sunlight.
My budy who is a car detailer explained that the best possible dash cleaner
is a product called Black Magic.  You can usually find it at most FLAPS.
