Hello, fellow VW fans (fanatics),

I recently had dealings with that huge VW parts yard in Iowa - Services
Diversified (...212 S Pearl...Zearing, IA 50278 Phone: (515)487-7629), and
felt I would pass along my experiences.  After a couple of phone calls, I
got a hold of Ron Blattle and let him know that I was looking for the
3-progned Smog pump pulley from a '74 loaf.  Now, keep in mind I have been
looking for this part for 3+ months, and only found 1 source at $295 + core
+ taxes +...  Well, a ouple of days later Ron called, and found not only
that part but the original Carb linkages I needed.  Plus, he charged me LESS
THAN 1/3 what the other guy wanted.

All in all, Ron was very pleasant to talk to, knew more about VW's than just
about anyone I've ever met, found the part I needed quick and charged me
what  iconsider to be a very reasonablr price.  

That big beautiful yellow beast is going to be California legal.  Finally!
Andy Rath
