&gt; Hi All, 
&gt; 
&gt; As some of you may remember, I recently had my 1600dp rebuilt in my 71 westy. 
&gt; Since then it has gotten paint and it ready for me to travel. It starts right 
&gt; up and will idle fine after a while (the darn choke has been disconnected and 
&gt; I cant for the life of me figure it out). Problem is that after about an 
&gt; eight to ten mile trip it runs extremely hot (smoke gushing from rear side 
&gt; vents) and loses a bit of power. 
&gt; It is not using oil, nor losing oil and the fresh air hoses are hooked up. 
&gt; (How can I tell for sure if my vents are open to get air to the engine?) I 
&gt; cant for the life of me figure out what's happening, and I am antsy to get it 
&gt; moving right. I need to take to over to get a new battery tray welded in so I 
&gt; can take advantage of this great camping weather!
&gt; Anyone have any ideas, or wanna help?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks all!
