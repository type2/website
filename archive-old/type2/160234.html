Subject: Re: [T2] Rebuild just one cylinder? Cam? Bigger valves?

That seems a reasonable change to the engine output but I'm not sure  
exactly what result you will get when you try to push the bus through  
the air at 70 mph after making that change. More torque down low  
should be your goal not less.

When the valves get larger the velocity of the air/fuel mixture  
passing by them decreases so at low rpms I believe that a reduction  
in torque could happen in practice. Just changing one part of the  
engine tends to negate some of the engineering that went into it's  
design as David already said.

Here's some data to chew on:

The stock 914 Type 4 motor has a special head that is different from  
any other Type 4 head. One of the changes made were larger valves.  
The 914 2.0L cam has the same specs as the 1.7L bus cam so here's an  
apples to oranges to apples comparison. :-)

1.7L bus head : 39 x 33mm
2.0L bus head: 37.5 x 33mm
2.0L 914 head: 42 x 36mm

1.7L bus:

63 HP _at_ 4800rpm
81 ft.lbs _at_ 3200rpm

2.0L bus:

68 HP _at_ 4200rpm
101 ft.lbs _at_ 3000rpm

2.0L 914 :

91 HP _at_ 4900rpm
105 ft.lbs _at_ 3500rpm

Comparison:

1.7L bus:				&lt;- baseline
2.0L bus vs. 1.7L bus:		&lt;- bigger bore/stroke, smaller valves,  
different cam
2.0L 914 vs. 1.7L bus:		&lt;- way different head, bigger valves, same cam
2.0L 914 vs. 2.0L bus:		&lt;- way different head, bigger valves,  
different cam

In every comparison, there were improvements in HP and Torque but  
only from the combinations of parts the engineers put together. We  
are also comparing L-Jet to D-Jet...

Given that the 914 head was available in 1973 long before the 2.0L  
bus came out in 1976 you have to wonder why VW didn't just slap it on  
the 2.0L bus and why they instead created a special head.
