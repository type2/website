Many thanks to the folks on the list who helped me figure out what i wanted
to get. I found a 1971 brown westy in Mesa, AZ. it was $2700, which is
still a lot cheaper than anything comparable in the Northeast. very minor
surface rust in two locations, but that doesn't matter, since i'm going to
have it painted when i get home anyway. i'll gust grind that stuff off
first. Has a fridge, but no stove. I'm still undecided if i want to get
one, since a coleman propane stove is pretty portable. i think i'd rather
have the space inside. It was re-upholstered inside a couple of years ago,
and has pretty good carpeting. structurally, the bus is fine, and the
engine just purrs. it was rebuilt 36k miles ago by a place in phoenix
called BAP imports. i've heard good things about them from three people
around here, one is a friend who used to work for an engine rebuild
specialist.

Her previous owner named her zippy, but i have a hard time with that, since
i can only picture zippy the pinhead when i think of it. so, i'm going to
call her zerbina [zippy's wife, just as weird].

hopefully i can pick it up this afternoon. turns out that i can just drive
it home, since i have a mailing address here in AZ that forwards my mail to
boston. it's so much easier dealing with car registration stuff here than
in boston!

are there spare tire mounts i can get for the front of a '71? I'd like to
put the spareup there so i can build a cabinet in the back. seems like a
waste of space when the tire could be outside.
