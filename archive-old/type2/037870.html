well, nothing will stop a really determined thief, but you can slow em
down enough that most will leave it alone

in mine
.  a hidden switch that must be held down while the starter is working for
the engine to start.
.  hidden fuel shut off when leaving unattended for long periods of time

and something that probably really puts the brakes on any potential thief

Hand Controls
  very few people have any clue what that extra &quot;gearshift&quot; lever is for
nor how to drive with thier hands rather than their feet ;8*}
