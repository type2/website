&gt; As far as I know type 4 rods can go either way up, as long as you match
the
&gt; numbers on the halves.

Unless confronted by an obviously better possibility:)
I knew there was a reason, just couldn't figure what it was.

&gt;type IV rods do not have an orientation dimensionally the way type 1 rods
&gt;do. what i mean is that TIV rods are symmetrical. T1 rods have an offset at
&gt;the small end, so the numbers must all face the same way in operation.

&gt; however, there is still a correct orientation, which is numbers up in
&gt;operation. this makes all the tangs in the rod bearings also face the same
&gt;way, which is away from the direction of rotation.
