&gt;It has a plate labled Bosch  VJR 4BR8.  It's cast iron the upper
&gt;...
&gt;Ring any bells?  I'm thinking this baby is out of an OOOLD motor.
&gt;

My exchange service book says the following:

Part # 211 905 205 EX
Type 2 all models from Chassis no. 20-69 409 to 469 505
    ( all 36 hp Buses?)
Introduced from engine # 3 399 000 from engine # 2 430 505

My '55 Bus engine came with a VJ 4 BR8 dizzy, I'm not sure of the
difference.  I'd be interested in purchasing it but I think you live in
Europe (?) so shipping would be a killer.  I need one for my '54 Bus.
Honestly, I've seen them for $30 - $75 at shows, depending on
condition/completeness.  I saw a complete VJ 4 BR8 with cap, rotor, etc. go
for $35 at a show about a month ago.  That seemed like a great deal.
