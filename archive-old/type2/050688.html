&gt;Greetings,
&gt;     I am getting ready to return to service, my '76 Deluxe Westy.  While I
&gt;have the engine out, I plan to replace all the fuel line (with fuel injected
&gt;rated hose).  What length of fuel line will I need to buy in order to
&gt;replace all the fuel line?  Also, I think that the clutch operating fork

Depends, early '76 will have stock all rubber lines to and from the cold
start valve.  With steel only on the ring pieces.  This van takes a lot
of fuel line.  2 meters at least including the long one to the tank (which
technically could be cheapo american low pressure if you wanted) but
I'd use all German FI line from Bus Depot or whoever, or fabric covered
if that is you liking, and I'd get 3 meters just to be sure.  You'll use it
again later.  Make SURE to replace even the short pieces on the
injectors.  Getting the crimped on ferrule off to do this is dealt with
many times in the archives, basically cut across it with a dremel or
a hacksaw at an angle, peel it back, pull off the line, remove the
ferrule, replace it and all the other clamps with whatever you like.  I use
marine grade all stainless worm clamps from McMaster-Carr, some
like the real German style FI clamps which can't be easily overtightened
but they rust so I simply don't overtighten my worm ones.  If it is a very
late '76 it may have the steel lines to and from the cold start, these
take a lot less line and a lot more clamps.  Sometimes I feel it better
to actually backgrade the system to the all rubber like VW went back
to in the waterboxer because I don't like the way the steel lines bend
the short bits of hose in between the steel parts.  If you do that you
should also cover the rubber with the grey sheath stuff stock up till
'76 or after '83.  REGARDLESS I can't stress enough to replace the
lines ON THE INJECTORS, a lot of people don't and they aren't any
miraculously better than the rest.  In fact they are often real loose
on the injector as that crimped ferrule isn't really as well done as
it should be.  YMMV.
