Well, my T1 experience is limited to the cheapy I put on mine which was a
piece of junk.  I did just get off the phone with John Anderson and he and
did talk about it.  He said the Gene Berg one was much higher in quality
than the Bugpack/Mofoco ones and I woudl expect he aircooled_dot_net one to be
similar to the Berg one (and it may, in fact, *be* the Berg one).  I
should probably leave it to John Connoly to answer, but in this as with so
much else, you get what you pay for.
