Subject: Solvang, CA This Weekend!!!

Hi all...

Just a reminder...
Solvang Vintage VW Show is Saturday, 10/3/98 starting at 8:00AM.
I hope to see some bus listees there... I'm still trying to get my '79
ready... but a cracked windshield and a warning from the local California
Hiway Patrol might just ruin my fun unless I can get it replaced late on
Friday... otherwise... I'll be driving my watercooled VW to the show...
Hey.. at least it's a VW...   email me directly, and perhaps we can set up
a meeting place and time for listees...

I've got a new email address.... for those who might have been looking for
me...

Scott
'79 Bus
'97 GTI VR6
