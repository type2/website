Subject: Re: [T2] Dipstick Thermometer at WalMart?

I may pick one up. Not to leave in there though, but to be able to perform a
quick check. Just swap for a few moments to get a reading, then swap back.

I wouldn't trust the display to be able to handle the heat and vibration in
a bus engine compartment.
