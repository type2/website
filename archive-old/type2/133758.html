Subject: RE: [T2] Distributor drive gear backwards...NOW WHAT??

&gt;From: John Baker Ok, so we have been having problems getting my friends
&gt;&quot;new&quot; unknown 1700 engine to run. Ran tests and found
&gt;that we had spark, fuel and compression..So why would
&gt;the d*mn thing still not run?? So i adjusted the
&gt;valves, all were VERY tight. Tried to start it again,
&gt;still nothing. So on a whim I reversed the order of
&gt;the iginition wires, put 1 where 3 should be and vice
&gt;versa. Then tried it again and the engine roared to
&gt;life! Sounded pretty good in fact. Anyway, this mans
&gt;that the distributor drive gear was put in 180 degrees
&gt;off, right?  So is it OK to live with it like this for
&gt;a while, will it run with the plug wires in this order
&gt;without problems or damage? OR is this a situation
&gt;(the dizzy drive gear) that needs to be corrected
&gt;right now? If the latter, exactly what is involved in
&gt;making the dizzy drive gear right? What special
&gt;tools\skills does one need to accomplish this task??
&gt;Can it be done without tearing into the engine??

John,

First remove the distributor and get a hold of one of these. I think Larry's 
Offroad in Ohio is where i got mine reasonable.

Really easy to do. Drop in the tool after you pull the little spring out. 
Then tighten, pull and twist it is out. Be careful not loose the two washers 
at the bottom of the drive. Hopefully they will stay seated in the case. 
After it is out line it up they way it should be and drop it back in. I 
always turn it counterclockwise about 10 degrees or so so that as it rotates 
renengagine with the gear, it will result in spinning into place. Try it a 
couple of times until you get it where you want it.

Other than that I had a bug I ran for a year and a half like that. No see 
through distributor though.

TravelOn,
