Subject: '79 Westy Wiring

I'm looking for the wiring diagram for late model bay window campers (Westy)
that covers aux battery &amp; charging (form engine and AC), frig, sink, etc.
(if there is an etc.).  

 

One wire that is confounding me is a heavy red wire that comes out from
under the driver's seat towards the dash and stops (I can only assume that
one of the POs disconnected it). I put a meter on it and I get nothing (when
engine is off and when engine is running). the other end of the wire appears
to go under the cabinets and I don't want to pull them out to see where it
goes.

 

TIA,

 

Wayne
