Subject: Re: [T2] mysterious rattle

HOLY SHOCK ABSORBER, BAT MAN!!!
guess what i found out that noise was? the bolt through the top of the
left rear shock was out! it is still in the shock, but it isnt attached
to the bus. is there a bolt on the back or does it bolt into the body? if
the latter is the case, then i will bolt it back in tomorrow (when i can
see what i am doing) but if it is supposed to have a nut on the back,
then i think i am screwed. i am fairly certain it is gone. is there a
bolt on my 65 beetle i can steal to get a replacement?

thanks, 
chris

ps~ how bad/dangerous is it to drive with the shock not secured as it has
been the last week or so?
