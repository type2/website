Subject: '70 Won't Start - Help!

Hey Now-

First &quot;major&quot; problem occurred today and I'm looking for some help and
if anyone in the Boulder, Colorado area has time to waste tomorrow
(Sunday 12/1) I'd gladly supply some home brew or Dead tapes or anything
for their efforts!

Took the bus out today - started up fine around noon.  Drove from
Boulder to Westminster (about 15 miles) then up to Longmont to check out
some used Jeep Cherokees (for my wife).  We stopped at the Jeep dealer
in Longmont, walked around for about 10 minutes and then boom!  No
starting action.  Both &quot;red&quot; and &quot;green&quot; lights came on - turn the key -
click - nothing.  Of course I didn't have Muir with me, left him in the
apt cuz I was reading up some stuff recently, but I did remember the
thing about the starter being &quot;stuck&quot;.  Tried pushing it back and still
no go.  Turned the engine with a wrench and noticed the belt slipping a
little.  Took it off and put new one in.  Same thing.  It was getting
dark and cold so I left it there and took a cab back to Boulder...

So, I'm looking at Muir and guess that tomorrow I will examine the
starter/solenoid. Any tips?  Should I buy any new parts (starter?) to
bring with me?  My favorite VW parts place (and the only one I know) is
closed on Sundays. :(

Again any tips and/or volunteers :) would be appreciated.  I'd rather be
watching the Packer/Bear game but I need my bus!!

Mike
