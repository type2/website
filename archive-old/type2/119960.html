&gt; What happens when installing new lifters with an old cam, or vice versa.
&gt; Basically, whichever item is already &quot;broken in&quot; will be the piece that
&gt; takes the additional wear. For example... if you have a used camshaft,
&gt; and new lifters. The new lifters will take the least amount of wear, and
&gt; the camshaft will take the most amount of wear. This means that the lobes
&gt; will be worn down to the point that, well... you're going to get less
&gt; horsepower.... the lobes will wear unevenly, which will result in poor
&gt; idle, bad driveability.. etc. 

todd, My understanding of this is different than yours. I have always
understood it as this. Then first assembling a vw engine and first run
in you must run it for 15ish minutes to allow for the lifters and the
cam to work harden against each other to the same hardness. this
should create a situation that both parts have the same hardness and
should wear little against each other and at the same rate. A new
lifter will be quite soft compared to the old camshaft that is already
hardened in the engine, and that will most likely wear. of couse YMMV
