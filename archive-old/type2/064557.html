Subject: Bugout Query

I've never been to a bug out or any other such gathering of VW Afficionados.
I'm wondering if there is any chance that I could attend one with my '69 loaded
with all my parts and have any hope of coming home with none of the above and
maybe some cash?  I guess vw trends would have a list of events in my area.  But
what type of event is sort of like a swap meet.  I'd like to get rid of all my
three single port engines and misc bus stuff as well as all the parts I got from
parting out a '69 along with my freshly repainted '69 some time in the near
future.  So I'm open to suggestions...John Jensen in Annapolis
