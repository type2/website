Subject: re June 22 Drive Your VW to Work Day

I drive my TDI Beetle (Smoke) to work five days a week and my 87 Syncro
is my backup/sometime Friday driver.  I need to check over my 1960
double cab as it would have been nice to drive her to work today to
celebrate air-cooledness (as I have in the past) but sometimes she won't
idle when I come to a stop.

Donna, 74 Westfalia, 60 double cab, 87 Syncro, 98 TDI
