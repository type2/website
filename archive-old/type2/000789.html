Wahooooooo! the Eberspacher BN4 (late model) is installed and fully
operational in my 70 Westy! damn but the thing do put out some heat...

In honor of this momentous occassion, I am going to go camping tonight.
Every once and awhile I will flip on the old heater and get toasty :)

I will post later regarding my long, laborious installation, my many trials
and tribulations, and the incredible amount of time it took. But for now,
I've got heat, dammit, heat!

One short note of encouragement: for all you out there thinking about doing
this, I recommend it. Just make sure you got all the little parts you need.
I got lucky with my heater. Bought it sight unseen through the mail from
some guy in California. Paid $300, which is probably on the high side but it
was quite complete. And it fired up right away. God knows how long it had
been sitting around. All I had to do was adjust the fuel pump and the flame
switch. It runs clean and strong. Did I mention that it puts out some
serious heat?

More later,
Sincerely,
Toasty Bob
