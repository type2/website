Subject: Doh, starter still

Well, I thought I had figured out my starting probs from a few weeks
ago...WRONG. I replaced the ignition switch and everthing seemed peachy until
I tried to drive home last night from work. Nuthin. So I'm putting in the hot
start wiring and maybe that'll help. If anyone as any other ideas, please let
me know.
Symtoms are: Some times she starts rihgt up no prob. Last night and other
times I turn the key and my oil and Gen lights barely dim, but nothing else. I
crawl under and bypas the ignition and it turns great. Then I get in and it
starts although sluggishly.
BTW I think it was Mark Dearing who mentioned something about my starter
bushin being bad. I cna't check my old emails because my computer at home is
on the fritz. Could someone give me a little more info on this?

TIA
