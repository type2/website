Subject: fuel pump question, thanks and my bus is running, well sort of

Hello list,

I want to thank all of you that responded to my fuel
pump question. It appears that the fuel pump is hooked
up correctly. The vent port has a 5&quot; length of hose
attached to it. Someone put a screw in the end of the
hose. Any way, thanks for the help and reassurance! I
did get my bus running, finally. The dual Solex setup
will need to be adjusted and some more fine-tuning due
to richness and backfiring. I may even need to rebuild
the carburetors if I am unable to adjust and
synchronize them acording to my manuals and the
archives. I will worry about that if/when I come to
it. Thanks again!

David Kelly
From Wilmington, North Carolina
---------------------------------------------
My 74 bus with a 73 engine and other year
modifications soon to be finished. (I hope)
A regular Volknstein.
