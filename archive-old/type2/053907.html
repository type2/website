Subject: New engine not running right... Help!

I'm still planning to leave Tuesday, but my hope is failing...

New engine is in Frances ('76 Westy 2.0L FI Hydraulic).  Here's the
situation:  She runs rough and has no power.  Stalls immediately under load.
I have timed it using my brand new timing gun.  Dwell is 51.2.  Pulling
spark plugs one by one causes engine to falter except for #2.  I have
checked that it is getting spark by disconnecting at the distributor and
watching the spark arc to the plug wire.  If I pull the injector wires one
by one, exactly the same behaviour (pulling #2 does almost nothing).  I have
changed the injector, and switched wires with injector #1 and no change.  I
even went as far as hotwiring the injector to see if the cylinder is getting
gas, and manually turning the injector on and off has an effect on the
engine, so I assume it is firing gas.  I have checked for vacuum leaks, but
the behaviour seems odd for a vacuum leak anyway.  I don't have a
compression tester that I can use on this engine yet, but I'm thinking I may
have to get one quick (seems odd for a brand new engine, though eh?)  All
the plugs were gapped to .025.

Any suggestions?

Dismally yours,
Niall
