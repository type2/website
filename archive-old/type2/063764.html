Subject: Part numbers

friends -

I am trying to do a complete correct restoration of a '65 camper and would like
to find as many original parts as possible. To make this task easier it would be
helpful to have a list of part numbers to work from. Does anyone know where I
can find these numbers, a book or magazine or website, etc. Any help would be
VERY much appreciated. 
PEACE!
