Subject: Re; AC

&lt;&lt;A year before I paid a garage to convert a Chevy Van from R12 to R134,
and paid $450.00 for them to do it 

&lt;&lt;hey jeff You should have done some shopping that is way too much
unless they had to change everything.&gt;&gt; 

Depends on what &quot;Everything&quot; is Mark. 
Dryer,&amp; orfice tube, suck it down, &amp; recharge. 
It's very close to being right. 


If he got a new compressor, clutch, lines &amp; hoses, evaporator, orfice
tube, dryer and condensor , along with the freon swap in the
&quot;everything&quot; you mentioned --he got a BIG, LARGE, bargain. 

The shop got took on this deal with the word everything. 

Either way he did his shopping OK----
