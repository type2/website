Richard,

I have an autometer air-fuel gauge in my bus, it looks like the ones in the
links. Since I have a CA '79 bus, I have an o2 sensor already. I changed to
a 3-wire sensor, though. I have referenced the output of the air/fuel gauge
to the motortest analyzer, and they correlate pretty well, but the air/fuel
gauge pulses continuously up and down (with the output of the o2 sensor). I
am never sure if this gauge is telling me anything, but it has pretty
blinking lights...

There is another route for lambda measurement which costs a bit more, but is
far more accurate than a one or three wire sensor plus air/fuel gauge. It
uses a home-built kit and a special wide-band five wire  o2 sensor. If one
had one of these units you could plumb it into the vehicle for testing, then
remove it once things are set up.
