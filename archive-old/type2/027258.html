I was thinking about this too.  I already experimented with a 2&quot; duct 
feeding the carb up the vent column and then I thought I could seal off the 
fan's openning with a shallow cone and feed it with your 6&quot; duct up the 
other vent column.  Some might argue that if VW didn't do it why should I.  
Would that be enough volume of air for a stock 1600 DP with a 30/31 carb and 
stock exhaust?
