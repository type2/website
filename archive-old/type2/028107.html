Subject: NEED Rear Tranny Mount
Message-ID: &lt;KLAABMDFEMIKCAAA_at_theglobe_dot_com&gt;

Well, if anyone out there has a bay window bus they're parting out, I need at least one of the rear tranny mounts (I'll gladly buy 2 if you got 'em). These are the small, cylindrical mounts that attach to the rear tranny support.

The part number is 211 599 431.

Please don't write me suggesting a vendor. None of them have them...unless they sell used parts. I'll be hunting locally too, but the pickin's are slim around these parts.

Thanks! Joe
