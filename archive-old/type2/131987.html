&gt; Do you suppose a 1600 DP will tow this weight?

We just got back from &quot;Fools Fest&quot; at Indian Cave state park in Nebraska.
Good turnout of busses.  Here is my little copilot and her friendly hippo in
front of our bus towing a Scamp.

As far as your question goes, our Scamp is a 13' model, but I do have many
options such as furnace, water heater, shower and airconditioner which add
some over the basic model.  My bus has a tired 2 liter and I put in a lower
gear tranny out of a '73.  I have problems on hills and with head winds.
Don't think I would like to pull with a 1600.  In fact I am trying to find
the time to put together a splitty with a TDI diesel on board.

The splitty will be a standard model with just a fold down seat and one
cabinet so it should weigh much less than the '76 westy and have a little
more power.  Hopefully this combination will get me around a little better
and help with the fuel savings.
