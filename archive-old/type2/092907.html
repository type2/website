Subject: Re: [T2] 75 bus fuel smell

And the vent hoses. Mine were quite rotted.


&gt;I would start by replacing every fuel hose in the bus.  If one hose goes I
&gt;feel the others are not far behind.  Could be just one hose seeping a
&gt;little.  I would do it now.  You were lucky this time.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Hey everyone  the wifes 75 seems to have a faint fuel smell in the front.
&gt; &gt; She says it gets worse when the tank gets low.  I have not seen any leaks
&gt;but
&gt; &gt; last month the injector hose on 4 broke and sent gas everywere.  Yes It is
&gt; &gt; equipped with a fire extinguisher.  Maybe she is extra sensative but im
&gt; &gt; looking for ideas.
&gt; &gt; Thanks
