Excerpts from mail: 25-Feb-99 tire demounter by jdinan_at_erols_dot_com 
&gt; 
&gt; Seems as though I am frequently removing my tires from their rims.
&gt; Sometimes to paint the rims; sometimes to install port-a-walls.
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to have the ability to do this in the garage instead of
&gt; trusting the job to a local service station.
&gt; 
&gt; In the Northern catalog are listed three gadgets for doing this.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone used one of these home remedies?  Do they work? Do they injure
&gt; the seal or the rim?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks, Jack
&gt; 
JC Whitney makes a tool called a bead breaker, it breaks the seal
between tire and rim. a friend of mine bought one (around $50) I tried
it and liked the way it worked. I made a copy of it out of angle iron
and flat stock, I think it's better than Whitney's! I can send pictures
if you'd like to build one yourself.

RJ.
