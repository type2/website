&gt; Hello listers!
&gt; I have a couple of questions about the fuel door area on my bus...
&gt;
&gt; 1. My 71 bus has a lock on the fuel door. Is this the handy work of my
&gt; previous owner or was this a option way back when?

Not an option that I know of, but a dealer might have added it.

&gt; 2. There is a little hole right beneath my gas neck. What does this drain
&gt; to? I ask because when I wash the car or when it rains, water pools around
&gt; that hole. I'd hate to have water draining into the gas...

Excellent question, and I don't have a precise answer.  It doesn't drain
to the gas tank, in any case.
