Subject: '71 Rear Wheel Bearing
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I have loud noise from rear wheels, even when I take it out of gear, louder
as you go faster....  I think it is on the passenger side, but hard to tell
for sure.  Sounds like wheel bearings, right?

I'm clueless on this type of work, studied the archives and concluded that
this isn't something you have to do very often and there seems to be a lot
of potential to make mistakes.  The simple thing may be to take it to a
local VW shop.  Can anyone relate some experiences as to prices I should
expect to pay?

Am I being a wimp, should I do it myself?  Can you get away with just doing
one side, or should you do both sides at the same time?

Thanks.
