Subject: Re: [T2] Don't scrap your Buses!

i have seen bilboards here in tulsa, ok for people to donate cars, boats
and other things to charities. i never looked into where they go, though.
now i have to wonder! then again, if they are scrapping them, then why do
they need to be running? i dont know if it matters if it runs, here.

&gt; Here in California, due to a state-sponsored program they are offering
tax

&gt; population in short time. Does anyone else have states with programs
like
&gt; this? Just curious. Jan B
