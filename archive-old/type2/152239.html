Subject: Re: [T2] 82 Torque Converter Scraping Noise

&gt; When I purchased my 82 Vanagon last july every so often I would hear an
&gt; intermittent  scraping noise coming from the engine area and tightened the muffler
&gt; bracket and would only hear the noise when it was cold and then every so often

&gt; noise was coming from the Torque Converter in the auto tranny.  Now have 160k
&gt; miles on her and it has been 5k since tranny servicing.  All seems fine except
&gt; the intermittent little tiny scraping noise now and then.

hmmm, I've never heard TC making noise they usually just stop transmitting
power. but I'm sure it happens

&gt; At 122k miles the previous owners had the tranny rebuilt will $800 in parts
&gt; including a new Torque converter.  2k later the torque converter and front
&gt; seals were replaced and at 150k the flywheel was replaced.

a TC should last longer than 40k miles, wonder if he just stuck a good
junkyard TC or actually had one rebuilt.   fortunately the VW TC is
rebuildably and relatively inexpensive, don't know where you are located
but I've had em rebuilt at &quot;Delmarva converter source&quot; with good results.
they no longer have cores so you have to give em one to rebuild but it was
under $150

&gt; Wondering how long before failure and if I need to just find a different
&gt; tranny...This one seems so smooth but obviously she is going to self destruct at
&gt; some point.

if you come accross a decent used auto tranny from one that is going to be
parted or junked grab it, but converting to a manual is a real tough job,
it's been done but not easy,  fortunately the later 010 bus auto tranny is
still rebuilable as the parts are readily avaliable, finding someone who
can do it well is more difficult but not inpossible,  prices seem to be in
the $800-950 range for a full rebuild with warranty


good luck
Bob
