Subject: transmission woes

My clutch in Bluto, the '73 Safare Custom Camper, started acting up the
other day.  It's getting hard to get into first gear, and the clutch is
grabbing real close to the floor, but only sometimes.  Not good.  The
groaning bearing that I have been listening to ever since my first drive
Bluto back in 1988, is getting louder, and with a 3,000 mile drive coming
up next week, I decided to pull the engine and tranny, replace the tranny
and clutch, retorque the head bolts, rejet the carbs, and clean everything
up.

You would think that in a city the size of the Dallas/Ft. Worth Metroplex
there would be a breadloaf transmission I could buy from a junkyard.
Yesterday, I spent almost the entire day going from yard to yard, finding a
only a single stripped loaf and 3 early watercooled vanagons.  This morning
I started calling some of the big &quot;dismantlers&quot; that had been closed
yesterday.  I called almost every one in the yellow pages, and finally
found one that had a '76 tranny.

A little background - Bluto is one of the rare breadloaves that has both
the .89 4th gear and the 5.375 ring and pinion.  Only some late '73 models
have this combination, and it makes for a stump puller that over-revvs on
the freeway.  I printed out a copy of Dave Kautz's ratio chart (Thanks
Dave!!) which I had saved in my account for a good two years just for this
day.  It says I should be turning 3781RPM _at_ 60 mph.  The tach says 3850,
which is pretty close.

With Bluto's newer 2-liter engine, I figured I could get away with
installing a 76-79 bus tranny, which would drop the 3781 down to a
comfortable 3181, and allow me to drive faster and get better mileage at
the same time.

The guy wanted $200 for the '76 tranny exchange, which was a bit high, so I
told him I would get back to him (after I was sure his was the cheapest
available).  I did not find a single other 76-79 trans, so I called him
back today and told him I would take it, and that I would pick it up at
lunch.  He called me back about 1/2 hour later saying that he had made a
mistake, and that the tranny was from a '75 bus (early), not a '76.  I was
pretty disappointed, but remembered that there had been one other place
which had a '74 tranny for only $100.  I called him back and arranged to
pick it up at lunch.  The 74-75 tranny has the higher ring and pinion like
the '76 (4.857) but the lower .89 4th gear which would put the revs at 3416
- - about in the middle.  Not as good, but the tranny was $100 cheaper and I
figured I could pick up some bigger rear tires for that $100 and come out
almost as good.

So I drove the 25 miles to this junkyard on my lunch hour, and they show me
a transmission from a '68 type III.  Buncha losers.  I thank them for
wasting my time, and drive 25 miles back to work.  What to do?

I called a couple of transmission shops inquiring whether they could fix my
old tranny.  Most of them said, &quot;sure, if you bring in the new bearing&quot;.
One place said they had a '71 tranny that they would install for me for
only $950.  Yeah right.  The only other bus tranny I know of in Dallas is a
'70 that is in a yard near my house - $150 and I would have to pull it out.
Bus also looks undamaged, making me wonder if a bad tranny could be the
reason it was in the yard.

I finally called the first place back again, and told them I would be
willing to accept the '75 tranny, but not at $200.  I ask for their best
price, and they tell me they will absolutely not sell it for less than
$125.  Works for me.  :)  They say the '75 bus was hit really hard in the
front, so I think it's likely the tranny is good, and they are going to
guarantee it for 30 days.  One other bonus - this place is going to pull
the tranny for me, which will save me lots of work.

So, God willing, I will drive another 50 miles on my lunch hour tomorrow
and buy a good '75 bus tranny, install it later this week or this weekend,
and make the drive out to Mammoth the following week.  Or, if my luck
holds, the tranny will be junk.  :/  I can't believe how rare VW busses are
around here!  I could have had my pick of several for under $75 each in San
Diego...
