&gt; I need to ship some parts from the US to Canada. Does anyone have any
&gt; experience doing this? I checked UPS online for the cost and compared
&gt; it with UPS WorldShip at work and the price is about the same. What I
&gt; am confused about it duty, taxes etc. Do I declare a value? Is there
&gt; duty on shipping things that are not new and not really being &quot;sold&quot;
&gt; but are more of a &quot;gift&quot; ?

I have used the US post office with great success

mark it gift or sample and place the value at what was paid for it.
