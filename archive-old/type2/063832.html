Hi there volks

I'm a newbie on this list so this is just a short note to introduce myself.
I live in South Africa and am especially interested in pre-67 Type 2s. I'd
love to hear from any of you about anything related to aircooled VWs. If
anyone wants to know anything ralated to old Veedubs in South Africa,
please drop me an e-mail message.

Air-cooled forever!
