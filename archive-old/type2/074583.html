Subject: Re: [T2] piston weights

Shawn, Mike:
Try to find one the same BRAND manufacturer. I think there may have been 4 or
possibly 5 total brands:
Mahle and Kolbenschmidt would have been original.
NPR, Cofap,and possibly a Taiwanese no-name are aftermarket.
Because of differences in the steel strut design, they can weigh a lot
different.
NPR's out of the box were within about 1/4 gram when I built my 78 back in the
mid 80's. Good stuff.

&gt; &gt; &gt; So, I weighed a spare replacement piston that stan sent me (cuz my other
&gt; &gt; &gt; one's got a hole in it) and it was 1.2 ouces lighter than my others.  Is
&gt; &gt; &gt; that going to make a big difference?  and yes, they both had wrist pins,
&gt; &gt; &gt; c clips, and rings.
&gt;
&gt; 1.2 Oz!!!
&gt;
&gt; 1.2 oz X 28.35 grams/oz = 34.02 grams
&gt;
&gt; Better re-weigh that one.  It sounds like a totally different piston.
&gt;
&gt; Good Luck
