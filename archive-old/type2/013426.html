AAAAAARRRRRRRGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

And I though that Lucas was the prince of darkness...

I have owned Little British Cars and Little Italian
Cars, both with Lucas Electrics (Actually, the LIC was
worse as it had a combination of Lucas and Bosch, and
we all know how well the English and the Germans got
along in Italy...  LOL)  And none have given me the
grief I am experiencing with my '69 VW Bus!

Some of the fault has to lay with DPO's, how much I am
unsure, but there are plenty of signs of patchwork in
the electrics.

Problem:  no stop/turn/tail lights in the back and no
Headlights or parking lights up front.  Front turn
signals work, but are flashing at a fast rate
indicating that there is no electricity going to the
back of the bus.

Lamps and sockets are all good (well mechanically and
electrically) but no juice in the wires so up under
the dash I go...

Armed with a copy of the August 1967 (1968-1969 Model
Years) wiring diagram from VWoA I pull out the
instrument cluster to start chasing wires.  First thin
I notice is that the steering wheel is a real PITA to
work around.

First Question:  What size nut is that on the steering
wheel?

Next thing I notice is that there is a multitude of
spliced and disconnected wires and ...OUCH! that one
was hot!  Through the process of elimination I
determined that this was the main power feed from the
battery.

Second Question:  Why does the power line run from the
battery THROUGH the light switch on it's way to the
ignition switch and the fuse block???

As I was trying to figure out where this lead plugged
into, I had yet another blinding flash of the
obvious...  The wiring diagram I had in my hot little
paws did NOT match the wiring in my bus!

Back to the VintageBus_dot_com archives I go...  I took a
look and found a listing for 1969-1970 and open to
find a VWoA wiring diagram foe VW Type2 from August
1969 (1970 Models) and it more closely matches what I
find under my dash!

Exceptions that I have found so far:  

The '70 diagram shows side marker lights.  My bus
doesn't have these.  No biggie, but worth the note.

The '70 shows a 12 fuse fusebox with two 16 amp fuses.
 My bus only has a 10 fuse fusebox with all 8 amp
fuses.

No mention on either diagram is made for the electric
rear window defroster.

And on a side note: Just WHAT is an &quot;Electro-magnetic
Pilot Jet&quot;? and do I have one? do I need one? where's
mine?

My ponderings...  From the serial number I obviously
have a 1969 bus (239073439)  The date code on the
M-Code plate is &quot;18 N&quot; (18th week, year N?)  The rest
of the M-Code plate is a mystery to me as all the
tables I have found end at 1967 and contain NONE of
the codes on my plate.  This notwithstanding, I have
1970 components and wiring under the dash, at lest to
some extent.

Last Question:  Am I the victim of a DPO trying to
repair an electrical system with available parts, or
was there some sort of mid-production changes that I
do not have reference for?

To be honest, my frustration point has been reached to
the extent that I'm about ready to haul out the entire
mess and replace it with a custom built wiring harness.
