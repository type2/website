	Ok,
	This morning, I jump into the 70 single-cab, it fires up, and
I'm in a hurry :) so I don't warm up in place, I just back out and before
I can even change gears to 1st it stalls. Note: it fired up as usual, ran
fine, for 5-10-15-20 seconds, then dies utterly. 

	It cranks just fine, and responds to throttle by
changing to a 'hopeful' chunkachunka from the less hopeful chunk chunk
of starter-but-no-throttle... but it doesn't catch. 
	(It takes a little throttle to start it, typically, once its been 
run, even for a few seconds. The auto choke has  probably already cycled off.)
	Lots of cranking, no starting. Go around back, smell gas fumes
just fine at the tail pipe.
	Now I'll tell you what an idiot I am. It IS dragging a bit as it
cranks, as its been a few weeks and its a cold morning, so I figure, hey,
let Issac Newton help, I'll just bump-start in in reverse, since I'm pointed
up the hill to the main road... So I let it roll back, pop the clutch,
doesn't catch. Do it again a couple times. Now I'm 3 houses down the hill,
on the inside of a blind curve, with a non-starting vehicle :)

	I pop the distributor and check, the points are opening and closing 
in a professional manner. Everything in the distributor looks ok. More
cranking, more hopeful sounding but not starting.

	Now the only theory I've got is that I've got water in
my gas tank, somehow, and the floatbowl got me started but the tank
gas killed it. Even I don't believe that theory, and I'm out of time.
( I drove it daily for 2 weeks, filling with Chevron 92 or 89, about 3
weeks ago. Then let it sit for 3 weeks. Its been raining recently, cold
and humid in turns, and the tank was only about 1/4 filled when I parked it.)

	Only the dealer (Broadway VW) is listed under VW Repair in the
phone book, though some independants list VW among types worked on. So I
called Broadway and they said they had a couple guys who remembered aircooled
engines, they'd be happy to look at it. Since this IS the Bay Area, I figure
its not the first aircooled they've seen this year, so lacking anything else,
that's where I had it towed. AAA tow guy recomended &quot;Fritz and Peters&quot;, saying
Joe (Joe Fritz or Joe Peters? one is tempted to ask...) is a good wrench. Well,
they can be plan 'B'.

	Soooo, any guesses, motor heads? Motor is about 7K old, ran like
a top since installation, one problem with the point gap drifting down to
naught at about 6K miles, and NO, I hadn't checked it when I did the oil
change so it was certainly my fault. What's the silly oversight I'm
going to pay $85 minimum to get fixed? :)

	Anyone have good or bad to say about Broadway VW, or Fritz and
Peters? Other Oakland/Piedmont/Berkeley aircooled mechanics? 

	I threw my bike in the back and got back home from Broadway VW
in 37 minutes, up a heck of a hill, so I feel pretty good all things
considered.  You can send guesses and suggestiions directly to me if you
want.

	Cheers!
	Bill
