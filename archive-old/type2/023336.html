Electronic ignition is a retro fit item from a Vanagon. Any Type IV engine 
can receive it as I understand it.


&gt;But yeah, I'm thinking anything up to 79.  Were there any major
&gt;changes/improvements on the later models ~79?  I've only had 76s...  I
&gt;wouldn't mind having electronic ignition if it was offered stock on
&gt;later models...
&gt;
&gt;thanks,
&gt;Mike
