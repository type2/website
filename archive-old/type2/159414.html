  restart)

&gt;&gt; which we all know is Pet Ether that evaporates VERY QUICKLY and sprayed it
&gt; over the pump &gt;liberally.  Let it dry, and then went to start it- Voila!
&gt; 
&gt; Why does this work?  How does it fix the short?

I think it fixed it because the pump was overheating it.  The 
evaporating effect of the starter fluid cooled the pump the same way 
evaporating sweat cools your skin..
