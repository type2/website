Subject: [T2] Fixing stripped threads in aluminum head

I can't tighten down the exhaust headers at the heads on my 1976 2 liter 
Westy because the threads are stripped where the studs fit into the 
heads.  The only solution my mechanic knows about is to take the heads to a 
machine shop and have helicoils put in. Are other solutions available? Can 
I get this problem solved without taking the heads off and moving them to a 
machine shop?

Another idea the mechanic had was to drop the whole engine, drain the oil, 
and take the whole thing into the machine shop, where it could be flipped 
upside down and the helicoils installed without removing the heads.

I'm hoping somebody in the world is going to have a simpler way to hold my 
exhaust manifolds on that doesn't involve pulling the engine or the heads.
