Subject: Re: [T2] looking for my old bus (VA Beach)

Collie,

I live in Virginia Beach, about 2 miles from where you say the guy lived. I 
will ask around, but I am pretty sure that I know of most of the split 
windows in the area. The one thing about cars and Navy guys is that sometimes 
they move. I had a friend who worked at a VW shop here in town, he has a sea 
foam green 64 westy with side hatch, but he has had that for some time. I 
will ask him if he knows of your ol van.

In the meantime, try these shops and ask them. They are the local air cooled 
joints.

Whitehead's Auto  757-425-1999
Bughouse               757-497-8080

Hope that helps,

Chris B.

&gt; Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; I lived in Virginia Beach for 2 years, 1994 - 1996. I brought to the 
&gt; Hampton
&gt; Roads area, a 1965 OG paint 21-window. I traded it for a '78 Auto Westy 
&gt; with A\C
&gt; in 1995.
&gt; 
&gt; It was two-tone Seafoam Green and white with all the seats and
&gt; everything.....but REALLY rusty. It needed everything.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, I would like to find the current owner of this bus and possibly get it
&gt; 
&gt; back....
&gt; 
&gt; Any listees in the VA Beach, Chesapeake, Norfolk area that have any 
&gt; knowledge of
&gt; this bus would be appreciated, even vague leads....
&gt; 
&gt; The guy I traded it to was in the Navy and lived just West of Lynnhaven Dr,
&gt; South of the 44 (I think its now the 664?) He drove an oval and had a rail 
&gt; and a
&gt; couple campers (parked on the street).....
&gt; 
&gt; I think his name may of been Dave....
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone?
&gt;
