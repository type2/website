Subject: Rants: tickets, insurance, etc

This is a thread I started on the porsche list, and 
since it's friday, I figured I'd try to stir it up
here as well...

***

Everyone has a rant, be it tickets, insurance, speed limits,
what have you.  It's probably been that way ever since the
days of chariots.

Think about this: numerically, motorists probably outnumber
any other &quot;special interest group&quot; by a wide margin.

What if we were to get it together, to organize and create
a political action committe of our own, to send our own
lobbyists to the various political centers and lobby for
what *we* want.

It could work: look at the grass roots support that got SB-42
passed (the smog bill which relaxed some of the restrictions
on older cars)

If we were 1/2 as organized as the NRA, we'd have autobahns
with a 125MPH speed *minumum*

If we were 1/10 as organized as the religious organizations,
we'd be able to get tax breaks for turbochargers.

Another thing to think about: California has the strictest
laws for smog, basically setting the bar for the rest of the
world, yet we have *no* safety inspections.  You can drive
the biggest, most clapped out hunk ofjunk, with parts falling
off, no headlights, wipers, bald tires, no turn signals, cracked 
windshield, but if you pass emissions, you're golden.
