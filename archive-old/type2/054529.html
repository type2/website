Subject: Toque Wrench Bought!

Volks,
Thanks for the response to my question posted yesterday. I went out and 
picked myself up a torgue wrench after the first person replied to my post. 
I got them all set to spec and put the engine back in last night. All that's 
left to do is put all the wiring and carbs back into the bus. I also changed 
my fuel lines while I had the engine out since the line from the pump to the 
tank split up the middle as I was taking it off..

cheers....
