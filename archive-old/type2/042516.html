I think your referring to the spacers,  ( I call them keepers) that have a
hole in each end where the socket head screws (with washers) go through.  I
have one I'll send you.  Don't think any of the complete CV &amp; boot kits come
with them....

p-mail me.

&gt; &gt; Secondly, I replaced all of the rear CV joints &amp; boots.  The old ones
had
&gt; &gt; these weird little batwing-shaped spacer/washer things that go between
the
&gt; &gt; outside of the boot and the bolts that hold the CV boot/joint in place.
One
&gt; &gt; was missing when I removed everything, and the new CV joints/boots did
not
&gt; &gt; come with this hardware (or any, for that matter).  Rocky Mountain
Motorworks
&gt; &gt; doesn't seem to carry them, and I would rather buy one than have my
husband
&gt; &gt; try to make one at work.  Any suggestions?
&gt;
&gt; RMMW doesn't have the washers you describe separately because they're in
the
&gt; CV kits they sell. If you bought the CVs from the , call and ask where the
&gt; rest of the kit is; if not, you may want to return the CV you have to
&gt; wherever you got it from and order one from one of the Big Three suppliers
&gt; everyone here seems to like--RMMW, Bus Depot and aircooled_dot_net.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; And lastly, can a clutch cable stretch?
&gt;
&gt; Yes it can.
