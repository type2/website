Original post said that the regular variety could be had from a commercial 
HVAC contractor. Look for one that has alot of materials on hand. You might 
also find that there are HVAC supply houses in your area. We have two in 
our small town of 25K.

The fiberglass reinforced variety is new to me but I'd love to see some 
pics to know what I was looking at when I saw one.

I don't have time to hunt this morning but I assume McMaster-Carr?
