Subject: [T2] My carb has a hole !


I was somewhat over served last night so I crashed at my cousin's house as 
opposed to becoming DWI ticket fodder.

This morning, when I fired Casper up to go home, he started immediately, 
just as he always does, hardly even letting me hear the sound of the 
starter motor.
Then, after a few seconds, Casper sort of died down. I figured it was just 
the early morning cold.

Upon re-start, there was a loud backfire, but Casper again fired right up.
Backfire ?? Hmmm ?? Why ?? Oh well !

On the ride home, I noticed I had very little power, and a really hard time 
accelerating up to full speed. Casper would do full speed, but the 
acceleration curve was long and drawn out.

When I got home, I opened the engine door, looked inside, and immediately 
saw that the &quot;plug&quot; in my carburetor was missing. You know, that metal disc 
that seems to be on there for whatever reason, held in by whatever holds it.
I can actually look inside my carburetor and see the innards.

OK, so how does one go about getting a replacement plug, and how is same 
held in place in that hole ?
To fill this hole in my carburetor, do I need to buy a whole new carb ?

I have a spare carb, but you guessed it........... That same plug is
missing.

What eats these things, anyway ?
