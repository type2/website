&gt; Giff, You're correct, I am doing a set of '77 2.0 cylinders...and $280 is a &quot;good&quot; price for these.
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; I truly *believe* the answer lies somewhere in between. Note that I 
&gt;use the word 'believe.' My guess is that you can get somewhere between &gt;30,000 and 70,000 on a set of properly honed cylinders and re-ringed &gt;pistons. When they're near the end of the wear cycle, honing and &gt;re-ringing can't fix the geometry problems that have developed.
Joe: 
I agree completely that type4 cylinders will have a good life after re
ringing.
You're also quite correct that the existing GEOMETRY of the pistons and
cylinders makes a big difference. If the motor being rebuilt was ever
fried thru lack of cooling air, oil, too lean or too much advance, they
may be damaged. But my experience is that p&amp;c's always outlast exhaust
valve guides and if you've got the heads off anyway....
A good inside mike is really helpful- well, a bore guage is REALLY
helpful, measuring anything with an inside mike takes a lot of feel and
practice (but there's only one way to get the practice, right?)
Cylinder wall taper shouldn't be more than 4 or 5 thousandths of an inch
(.004-.005). I've assembled chevys with 10 but the rings only lasted 20k
miles or so. The other three sides of GEOMETRY(that does describe the
essence of it) are the piston ring grooves. With a new ring in place,
there should be no more than .005 clearance between the groove and the
ring. 
On to honing. Actually what you're talking about here is glaze breaking.
Real hones are rigid and used as the final step after a rebore to bring
the bore to a precise size and finish. 
Support the cylinder some how-best would be fastening into the case
before you clean the case, but you'll NEED to clean the case then.
It's my belief that you don't want to make the cylinders very rough, but
you need some roughness to cause the rings to wear in, so, use a glaze
breaker hone of 180-320 grit, slather the walls with honing oil (mix
solvent or kerosene and motor oilso it's pretty runny)fasten the glaze
breaker into the slowest drill you can find and move the hone the hone
top to bottom in the cylinder while running the drill. Remember you're
not trying to take out a lot of metal, just giving it a new finish. The
ideal that all the books called for was a 30 degree crosshatch. 25
degrees or 50 degrees, I don't think the rings know the difference, but
try for some crosshatch. Maybe if your drill isn't very slow you might
try triggering it as you move the hone in and out. 30 to 60 seconds in
each hole is enough. To keep the stones wet, I put the oil in an oil can
(pump oiler) and slather it continuously.
Wait- you're not done! Now you've got to get that cast iron grit out of
the pores of the cylinder walls. Chevy books said soap and hot water
were the answer and it's sure easier to put vw cylinders in the kitchen
sink than Chevys, but I think that clean oil-wetted rags used to wipe
them down will work too. When they don't come out grey, they're clean.
Hope that helps!
