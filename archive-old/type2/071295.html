&gt;  Ok, I sure this has been covered in the archives,but I can't find it
&gt;  I believe someone offers the sheetmetal and engine support to put the 
&gt; upright
&gt;  into the 72 and later van (Like the european transporter)
&gt;  Does anyone have that information handy?

Yes the 1600 tin ware for a 1600 in a 72-79 bus can still be bought - point
your browser at www.justkampers.co_dot_uk

&gt;  Also, in the latest VWM mag from the UK they show a *new* Devon camper
&gt;  Uses a *new* &quot;1973ish&quot; Mexican bus......(Link-pin front end..with disc
&gt;  brakes!?!?)
&gt;  Like, you can still *buy* a new bus...
&gt;  Who had the vin plates for sale??
&gt;  (only kidding, *I'd* get caught, sure as sunshine)
&gt;  

I assume by VWM you mean Volksworld - the compares a 70s Westfalia cnversion
with a 1998 Devon conversion.
These Devon conversion loafs are definetly NOT 1973 ish niether are they
Mexican. 
As the article states they are based on current production loaf bus as made by
VW Brazil. (to comply with emmissions they use the very clean Mexican 1600
aircooled FI engine which gives 64bhp)

Can you still buy one YES
Can you import one into USA - the concessous from previous discussions on the
list is NO.

Good luck
Bob
