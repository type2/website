Subject: Overheating your aircooled bus

With all the recent talk of gasoline additives and how driving
your bus at 55 mph during the summer might be a good idea to 
prevent overheating, I was wondering how adding a modified, 
higher-volume, sump would effect this problem.  My gut feeling
is that it wouldn't help much because your heat exchangers 
aren't going to be removing any more heat from the oil than
they already are, but adding additional mass to your cooling
system would:

a) take longer to warm up your engine

b) take it longer to change the oil temperature in general 
	(stays cooler longer, stays hot longer)

c) cool down your system more if the heat loss off of the
	sump was anything more than negligible (gut reaction
	says maybe a little, but not much).


it would also allow you to potentially add a slightly higher
flowrate oil pump, but I'd have to do the calculations on that
(my heat transfer skills are a little rusty).

Along the lines of (c), does the higher volume sump that places
like Bus Depot offer have a form-factor that gives you a lower
ground clearance in the rear of the bus?  i.e. how is it bigger?
is it deeper, wider, longer?  Some of these might effect how
the sump itself transfers heat...

Anyway, just some thoughts as i don't relish driving 55 mph
during the summer...oh, wait, i live in san diego and it's
almost *always* summer here!  Hope these fall within the scope
of normal (non-friday) discussion...
