Subject: Re: [T2] ridge at top of ring travel


     I am rebuilding my 78' type IV motor now because of a hole in a piston
and let me give you some advice since thats what this whole list seems to
be about. You need to look at the rest of that motor. If you have a holed
piston you probably burnt a valve or dropped a seat. The chunks of that
piston and valve have probably fallen into the case and have trashed your
cam and crank. If not I would imagine that there are pieces of aluminum in
your oil grinding away at the bearings. If you simply replace the piston
and even the  head and rings you may be wasting money. I thought I could
get away with a top end rebuild on mine but after seeeing that aluminum in
the case I discovered the true situation. You have to get all of that
aluminum out of the case. Its not cheap but nows the time to do it right.
If you question your abilities I would strongly advise you to speak to Bob
Donalds at Boston Engine or Jake Raby . These two guys are the top type IV
gurus in the country and their prices are reasonable. I am putting my motor
together myself, using all of Bob's advice, and am now realizing that I
could have saved some money if I would have just bought the longblock from
him...
     I didn't mean to ruin your day, just hope to help save future
aggravation...

Shouldn't have a ridge that soon but you'll need to bust the glaze and
install new rings.
I'd look at the rod bearing from the overheated cylinder to be sure it
isn't hammered out.
I've got a single Mahle cylinder and piston if you need it, $40.00,
$48.00 with rings installed.

&gt; wanted
&gt; to change the rings on all the cylinders so that the compressions
