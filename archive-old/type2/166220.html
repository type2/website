Subject: Bad Fuel Pump &amp; bad gas/blocked tank  in one trip??

Had fun diagnosing a &quot;random&quot; cutting out after running fine from NJ for 
like 600 mi, but after stopping in a rest areas on the way to Indiana 
Dunes and to Flint, Michigan it would crank but not start.  The old 
silty tank had been replaced with a cleaner one, as well as some FIC 
fuel pump by rebuilder- Hmm- Chinese aftermarket?-.  Thought it was 
double relay, but replacing 2 said this is not possible-(worked, but 
likely red herring-turned out that letting pump cool for 10 min let it 
run). Ah-ha-putting on the fuel pressure gauge and waiting for it to 
happen showed no pressure when it was cranking and not starting (yes I 
direct wired the pump and the BIG spark on contact told me it was nearly 
shorted)- so off to a local parts store that only had a same diameter 
Bosch 69100 pump MADE IN GERMANY for $110, apparently for a Ford truck 
('89 F250)-narrower filter inlet required me getting another style 
filter.  Ran great (pressure was steady, a bit high 40 with vac to 47 no 
vac) for next 3-4 hrs until second gas stop on Pa Turnpike, where soon 
it acted just like blocked fuel filter (hesitation on any throttle 
increase) -we got off the turnpike and I noticed noisy pump (whiny) and 
pressure gauge fluctuated wildly around 35 or so- pulled the filter and 
let tank drain a bit- WTF, brown &quot;oily&quot; sediment comes out and flow is 
less than normal-we let a quart or so run out and it got clearer, and I 
put a new VW filter on by doubling a hose inside the thicker hose (hmmm- 
the removed new one I could blow through fine- blocked tank also?).  It 
still hesitated with any throttle increase especilally off from 
stoplights so we drove the next 120 miles to home on local roads past 
Carlisle and Harrisburg and King of Prussia {can you say stoplights?} 
using lower gears on hills and topping it up once to dilute the gas (6 
gall).  Now I must ask- the fuel pump I think is for a 4 liter truck- 
could it be overtaxing the pressure regulator in any way? Are the wide 
swings and noise due to pump starvation?  Tomorrow we can &quot;flush&quot; the 
tank (blow air up, drain gas) and see if it runs better.
