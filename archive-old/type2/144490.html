Subject: Seattle.. no Octobugfest ..but!  VolksTag

A Puget sound dub shop.. check out the forum for local shtuff.


What: VolksTag
When: October 9th, 2005
Where: Titlow Park, Tacoma WA
Why: No Octobugfest this year so we're taking matters into our own
hands and putting on a show directed towards the daily drivers.
Although all VW's are welcome and encouraged to enter, we are looking
to see as many dailys as possible.

Many of us know that in recent years the show in the parking lot has
been almost as inspiring as the show inside. Our goal is to bridge that
gap and have ONE show with EVERYONE involved.


Fees:
$20 Entry Fee (Participation Judging, Lots of Trophys, Lots of Classes)
$20 Swap Spaces
$20 To Sell Your Car in the show
$5 To Park your car in the show with everyone else without being
judged.


Titlow Park:
Titlow Park is a great location for this event and we're excited to
have it here. The park offers Covered Gazebos, approximately 175-200
parking spots (so get there EARLY to secure a spot), Bathrooms, BBall
Courts, Tennis Courts, Trains, and its right on the Puget Sound.

The person who says it cannot be done.... 
should not interrupt the person doing it.
