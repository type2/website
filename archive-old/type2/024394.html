Subject: Swing lever/ Center Pin woes
Date: Mon, 13 Nov 2000 12:57:01 -0600

Boy, I've really gotten myself into a mess this time. I had decided to
replace the center pin/ bushings on my 1970 Westphalia. Before doing so I
got some information on the procedure from the Type 2 Library. Armed with
this, the Muir book, and factory service manual I went to it. Well needless
to say I had troubles. The bushings were a real bear to get out. The
drawbolt procedure didn't work. The c-clamp procedure didn't work. I finally
resorted to driving them out with a punch, this after many hours of
frustration. Getting the new bushings in wasn't that bad. I used the
drawbolt arrangement. It just took a while to get them started in straight.
Now to my real problem. From what I read, and from people I talked to I was
told that ' 68 and up bushings did not need reaming. But low and behold when
I go to put the pin in......uh oh. So I tried using a brake cylinder hone,
which worked reasonably well. I got the pin started through the bottom
bushing, but when it got to the top it would go no further. So I tried
pulling the pin back out. No go. I should mention at this time it was
getting dark, it was getting cold, and this was the third Saturday I'd
worked on this. The Muir book said it was o.k. to hammer it a little. Like
an idiot.....I hammered a lot. To make a loooong story short the groove in
the pin did not line up and I've gotten the pin in there so tight I can't
move it or get it back out. Questions. How tight or loose is the pin
supposed to be. Do I need to ream? Am I going to have to remove the front
end to get this s.o.b. back out. I've broke one 6&quot; c-clamp already. Perhaps
I could use a puller? Patience.....
