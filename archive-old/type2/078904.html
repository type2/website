Subject: Re: [T2] Is airconditioning a good idea in stock 71 Westy?

&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; I have a stock 1600cc 71 Westy and often times it gets pretty hot in So.
&gt; Cal... I thought about putting a fan or two, but I don't know how much this
&gt; will do. If all possible, I'd like to avoid putting an ac. It seems like
&gt; there was a factory air condition option for this year as I read in the
&gt; original manual. If I can't endure, I am thinking of putting an ac in my
&gt; westy(read an ad by a shop in San Diego area that specializes VW ac for
&gt; air-cooled). Does anyone have any idea as to it's impact on the 1600cc
&gt; engine, horse power and the engine life? I am also curious if one were to
&gt; put the ac in, how would they connect the duct into stock Westy?

There was no factory option that I know of, but there was a
dealer-installed system with a self-contained evaporator/blower/fan that
either went under the dash or against the ceiling behind the driver.

These systems were rather Rube Goldberg in design,. but they did work
after a fashion.  I live in SoCal, and don't really think the hassle of
rounding up the parts and installing them is worth it.
