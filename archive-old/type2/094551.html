Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Where do I get a yellow fire extinguisher?

several years back i found some  of my old data sheets from when i did 
certain inspections in the military.  they were derived from some fire 
department research centers stats.  on those lists were tables rating 
fires in seconds of extinguisher time.  your smallest extinguisher 
normally found in cars is rated at 6 to 8 seconds(same as kitchen 
type).  an engine fire the size of the normal bug was rated in the 8 to 
10 second range.  engine compartments like the buses with all of their 
little extra spots were 12 - 14 seconds and did not take into 
consideration a fuel source right next to the engine  as  in buses (not 
vanagons).  the extinguisher in the vanagon westyies is rated under 
motorhome laws and is for kitchen fire, not engine fire.  the size and 
design of the vanagon engine compartment is probably in the 14 second 
plus rating and  possibly is not in a safe to put out category.   When 
i looked it over close i could see no way to put out a top engine fuel 
rail fire if you were carrying any cargo in the back.  on the bus you 
can drop a panel or have access to spray the engine. not on the vanagon 
if you cant find a way to safely pop the hatch.
