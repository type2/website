&gt;     I have decided what gauges I am going to install  and decided on 
&gt; three to protect my new engine.
&gt; I am going to purchase a head temp and oil pressure first. Later on I'll 
&gt; add oil temp. So I want to plan
&gt; on provisions for three. I am not really sure where I want to mount them 
&gt; yet. Where are yours mounted and how do you like them there?
