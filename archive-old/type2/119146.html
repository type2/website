Subject: RE: [T2] Bus Music???

Oh hell yeah, 90% of what I listen to is stuff that was written WELL
before I was born. I was born in 1978 (probably making me one of the
younger people on here). I actually got into it one day when I was
donating some clothes at the Goodwill store. I noticed that they had a
wrack of record albums. I though, woah! Cool.. the only records I had
ever owned wer some HeMan adventure records when I was like... 5 or
something. So I bought a bunch, figured out that they were only $0.25 a
record (half of them were unopened). The first record I bought was
something by Rare Earth.... &quot;I just wanna celebrate!&quot; I thought it was
kinda funny. My roommate and I copied it to a cassette tape, and we would
cruise around in the Fiero listening to it. So then I went back, bought
some Led Zepplin, Eagles, Jimmy Hendrix, Heart, and lots of other stuff.
It reminded me that I had a bunch of hippie records I borrowed from my
parents, so I started to look for that stuff too. Now that's about all I
listen to. 

I went through the whole No Doubt, Bush, Metallica, band craze too..
seems to me, pretty much anything that comes out now is just a modified
form of RAP. Maybe I'm getting too old? So, I find the older music to be
way more cool to listen to.

You should see the look on some people's faces when I'm cruising down the
road, and pull up to a stop light in my 73 Transporter, with 60s anti-war
rock blasting... people look at me like.. &quot;Did that guy steel that car?!&quot;
I totally look out of place! haahah.

&gt; If you really like this stuff, try 
&gt; The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band...
 
Wow, that's a name I haven't heard for a while! I actually have their
track &quot;Smell of Incense&quot; on my Westy's indash MP3 drive.  Other personal
favorites that share the &quot;psychedelia&quot; folder on my hard drive are H.P.
Lovecraft (the band, not the poet), Bubble Puppy, Pearls Before Swine,
Kalaidoscope, and the Glitterhouse.
