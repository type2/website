Subject: [T2] What I did for Christmas...

Just got a '79 Westy (Mexico Beige - Wonder Bread - nice Freedom II
awning, pics to follow!) in pristine physical condition - only to have 2
things suddenly occur - 

turn signal/emergency flasher failure
nasty tappety tappety from the engine

So, disconnected ground strap and replaced flasher relay (happened to
have a new one lying around), no fix (and this after 2 tool runs to get
a screwdriver that would fit in the fuse box sunken holes and clear all
the other crap in there so I could get it free for the flasher swap,
sigh).  Move on to the emergency flasher switch - reaching up under the
dash, the part of the switch that the lugs are on is floating free with
the wires - the little box still firmly attached to the dash.  I don't
believe this was the result of my gentle fumbling...  ;-)

This bus has the air conditioner - so access from underneath is
hampered, and in any case, the slack in the wires to this switch is
nonexistent.  I've pulled the radio - no help there - not really enough
room to get enuf access to get the lugs onto a new switch.

Removed the screws from the instrument panel - retrieving the wondeful
little clips that hold this together when tight and fall into the void
when undone - what's the secret here?  Not to unscrew completely?  When
this nightmare is over, how do I get it all back together?  Gar.  So now
I have the instrument panel loose, and it'll only give me maybe an inch
- still not enough room to get in there and replace it - and the wires
to the switch are not long enough to snake it out of that opening.  I am
horrified at the thought that I may inadvertantly disconnect something
else in there while I'm trying to get enuf slack to do this.  Should I
have more slack here?  I've tried to see if there are just 1 or 2 wires
hung up on something that I can move around and get more play, but it
ain't happening.

AND - how the heck do I get the switch BOX off of the backside of the
dash?  Again, room is a problem, but it doesnt' seem to want to budge. 
Seems like it oughta screw in there?  The back side of the box seems to
be pretty firmly lodged against a supporting arm behind it.

Any hints on assembly/disassembly apreciated!

Now to the tappety-tappety.  Lifters?  What should I check?  I'm new to
hydraulic valves and with this other crap haven't even had a chance to
look it up in any of my books - got updated Haynes/Bentley on order -
all mine were printed in '74.

Merry Ho-Ho and a Primal Scream,

Teri
