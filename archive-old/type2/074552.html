&gt; So, I weighed a spare replacement piston that stan sent me (cuz my other
&gt; one's got a hole in it) and it was 1.2 ouces lighter than my others.  Is
&gt; that going to make a big difference?  and yes, they both had wrist pins,
&gt; c clips, and rings.
&gt; 
&gt; Otherwise, I guess I'll just use this one temporarily to pass smog and
&gt; then put a new set of P&amp;Cs on.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; MIke
