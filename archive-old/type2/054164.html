Subject: westfalia roof rack

I was wondering if anyone out there can tell me if I can get a roof 
rack (for bikes) for my 79 Westfalia? Would one fit even though it is 
a pop-up? Currently I am running Yakima on my Jetta, and would like 
to stick with them. I checked with Yakima and they didnt know if one 
would work or not.

thanks.
todd.
