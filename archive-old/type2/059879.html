Subject: Weird noise (I'm stumped)
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I've got a slight but noticeable &quot;ticking/tapping&quot; noise in my recently
rebuilt engine that's got me stumped. It seems to be located in the driver's
side cylinder head area, and comes and goes at idle. It's not
excessive--some might listen and say &quot;that's what they sound like,&quot; but it's
driving me crazy. I pulled this engine apart once already to quiet a similar
noise that turned out to the a lifter making contact with a lifter bore. I
purchased clearanced lifters and that problem seemd to go away.

But now (or maybe always) I have this ticking/tapping noise.

One strange thing: I am running Berg bolt-together rocker arm shafts. I
suspected that my rocker arms were worn, and I pulled them and indeed they
were out of spec. So I replaced them with less worn ones (are there any
&quot;new&quot; rockers arms out there anywhere?) and the noise got WORSE. Then I
switched rocker assemblies, side to side, and the noise moved over to the
passenger side head. Aha! I said, &quot;there's something wrong with the damn
rocker shaft Berg sent me.

I promptly switched the rocker arms back to their original positions and
installed a different shaft and arms on the driver's side, and the noise is
back. Damn.

Could it be that I just can't find a decent set of rocker arms? Wouldn't
worn rocker arms effectively create more valve clearance, thereby creating
more noise?

Help me I'm stumped.
Bob
