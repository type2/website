Subject: VDO Tachometer wiring question.. short

Hey AirCooled Gang!,

I finally bought a VDO 7000 rpm tachometer and need a little help with the 
install.  All the directions make sense except for the part that shows 
wiring the tach to the fuse box.  Which fuse do I wire it to?  I think the 
accessory fuse is #9, I have to look at the manual again to make sure.

My bus is a 78.  I know many of you have them installed, any pointers?

Thanks so much,
Don Manzano
