Subject: Re: [T2] '76 FI engine?

Isn't that the truth Rick about rudeness and learned behaviors. I teach a
Grade 7 class up here in BC Canada. What are you teaching and where? Funny
how many teachers I run into that own and drive VW's.
Take care,

&gt; Amen to that!!  The emails without a face make some people feel they don't
&gt; have to live by the rules of politeness that we all need to live in
society,
&gt; or maybe some people never learned these rules which reflects to a poor
&gt; upbringing.  As a teacher, I have to deal, and try to change some of the
&gt; rude behavior of students, too bad some &quot;adults&quot; have to live this way
too.
&gt;
&gt; I noticed your mistake, but chalked it up to forgetting what type of
engine
&gt; the posting was about, but some people have to belittle others in order to
&gt; make themselves feel smart, very sad for these small minded and insecure
&gt; people.

&gt; &gt; I apologize for my incorrect posting.  I had my 1776 that I just got
&gt; &gt; finished recently in my mind.  My screw up.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; And believe it or not a few listees that will go nameless had to pmail
with
&gt; &gt; the rudest most cussing out for this mistake..................
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I feel that my posts and help I give are generally helpful.  It is a
shame
&gt; &gt; that a few faceless cowards resort to using the internet to talk to
another
&gt; &gt; listee in  a manner that they would not do face to face, or, trust me,
they
&gt; &gt; would be spitting teeth.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; You cannot pull a non-hydraulic lifter without splitting the case. or

&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; HUH???
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Apparently I've been doing the impossible all these years...  And has
&gt; &gt;&gt; anyone EVER seen a T4 hydraulic (or solid for that matter) lifter that
&gt; &gt;&gt; was mushroomed anywhere.  Now this informations is pretty much
&gt; &gt;&gt; true for a type 1 engine, though I'd still be amazed about a hydraulic
&gt; &gt;&gt; type 4 retrofit lifter (which is what my local guy installs) mushroomed
&gt; &gt;&gt; that far, maybe those crappy slip in T1 lifters.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; We aren't talking apples and oranges here volks the topic of this is
the
&gt; &gt;&gt; '76 TYPE 4 engine.  You can pull any T4 lifter at any time you darn
well
&gt; &gt;&gt; please boys and girls after merely pulling the pushrod tubes.  You can
&gt; &gt;&gt; even do it on waterboxers but unless you buy expensive collapsible
&gt; &gt;&gt; tubes you can't replace those without pulling the head.  Anyway I don't
&gt; &gt;&gt; want anyone getting confused here with incorrect information.  You can
&gt; &gt;&gt; in fact retrofit hydraulics ON TOP of the ole solid lifter cam though
some
&gt; &gt;&gt; will warn of this, many have done it and are happy enough with the
&gt; &gt; results.
&gt; &gt;&gt; You need to secure all of the hydraulic valve train including pushrods,
&gt; &gt;&gt; solid rocker spacers, etc. in order to do so.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Anyway for informative hints on the T4 valvetrain please reference
