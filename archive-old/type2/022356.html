&gt;Hey guys just bought a 73 Camper to replace my rusted out 72.

&gt;Is there any way to get the displacement of a motor with out taking it to
&gt;far apart?

Engine code would be one way.  Check the archives for details (I can never remember).  A 73 would have 1700cc's stock but many have been changed to 1800cc's when they are rebuilt since it is such an easy swap.

&gt;How do you know if you have hydrolic lifters?

Check for steel pushrods.

&gt;How do you know if you need lead substute?

You don't.

&gt;How bad is this compression?
&gt;#1 ~100 PSI
&gt;#2 ~100 PSI
&gt;#3 ~90  PSI....
&gt;#4 ~100 PSI

A bit low for sea level but balanced within acceptable limits.  I'd say okay for local trips but consider rebuilding before going on any cross-country trips.

Cool car!  :-)
