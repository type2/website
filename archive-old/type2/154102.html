Subject: Re: [T2] braided Brake Booster Hose

From Chai:

braided brake Booster hose~!~

anyone know who sales this and about how much it runs a foot ?

 this is for a 76 bay

tried a few places locally and looked at bus depot and couple other places
still havent found?

Maybe a dumb question but......

Why are you wanting braided rubber hose for a 76?

Your 76 bus uses white plastic tubing, part number N 020 390 1.

70mm from engine to check valve
1430mm from engine to pipe under bus
390mm from pipe to booster

Using the correct booster, from vin # 214 2110 466, you cannot connect rubber hose to it.

Bus Depot shows the hose,  http://www.busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=N0203901 , but I do not know the
length it is offered in. When VW offered it [they may still offer it] you ordered it in 5m lengths.
