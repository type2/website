&gt; ...I just finished removing the covers and pads for

&gt; seat that will.  It's pretty obvious that when the seats were originally

&gt; If anyone has any good tips for making the recovering of the driver's
&gt; seat any easier, I would sure like to see them.

What I did was to drill out the rivets.  After I recovered the seats, I
replaced the rivets with fine-thread SAE bolts and nylock nuts.  Works
fine!
