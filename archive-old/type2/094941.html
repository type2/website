Subject: '71 vacuum canister 

rdr_at_austin.rr_dot_com recently posted: &quot;After reassembling the distributor, I 
tested the vacuum canister by s*cking  on it and watching it advance the 
timing plate.&quot;
I've been running a PO installed 009 dist on my '71 for the past 20 years, 
but have recently acquired and cleaned up a stock 205Q to replace it with. 
Everything looks good, but I'm wondering how to check the vacuum canister, 
which is now off the dist. Should sucking on one of the hose fittings be 
enuf to move the lever arm?(mine doesn't) Or is more vacuum needed?
TIA
Best wishes
Denny Johnson
