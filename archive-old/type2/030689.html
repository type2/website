Yup.  supposed to.

&gt;  how long the points remain open, shouldn't it remain constant? If so,
&gt; why is my dwell angle going all over the place?


The most common reason is that your distributor is worn out.  The shaft
gets lots of play in it, and wobbles.  sometimes you gap will be .016,
other timesit'll be .019, or whatever....which causes your dwell to jump..


Why did you replace the Pertronix?  Off the top of my head, I'
d suggest installing one of these if you didnt want to rebuild the
distributor, as they dont rely on a constant gap for the dwell....

Otherwise, Ron and Jim both sell shim kits for VW distributors....(alas!
they wont work on my brothers Fox distributor, which has the same
problem...ha!)

good luck.
