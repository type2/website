Subject: quality of Brazil fuel pumps?

Oh list
    Do I have anything to worry about?  I bought a new fuel pump for my
71 1600 motor.  They sold me the round pump like I wanted but its made
in Brazil.  It doesn't come apart to change the fule filter, you must
run an in line filter.  That is not a concern I was just wondering.....

How are the Brazillian pumps?  Should I return it and look for a German
one?  Where should I get it from?
