Frank,

Your Bus is a Type II; has been, always will be!  From list posts and 
manuals, the following information is hopefully correct. AFAIK (?)

In the US:

The 195? to 1967 &quot;microbus&quot; body style is a T1.
The &quot;bay window&quot; style bus, 1968 to 1979, is a T2. 
The 1980 to 19?? Vanagon is a T3.
The 19?? to 20?? Eurovan is a T4.

The T1 and early T2's used the same or similar motor to the one installed in 
the same year Type I.

A VERY similar version of the 1700cc &quot;pancake&quot; or &quot;suitcase&quot; motor introduced 
in and used in the 69 - 7? Type IV 411/412 was used in the 1972 - 79 T2 bus, 
the 1980 - 83 T3 vanagon, the 1970 - 74 VW/Porsche 914 and the 1976 Porsche 
912E.  The Type IV and 914 motors had D-jetronic Fuel injection, The bus had 
carbs or L-Jetronic Fuel injection.

It seems the Type II's always got motors that first appeared elswhere, thus 
&quot;type I&quot; motors in T1's and &quot;type IV&quot; motors in T2's.
