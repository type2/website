Hey, I was riding along in my bus last night and all of sudden
a knocking noise comes from what sounds like the passenger sides front
tire. At first it was'nt bad but it just kept getting worse and worse.
I would'nt hear it when I had my foot on the gas but as soon as I took
my foot off the gas pedal I would hear it again. Any ideas? Please
email me with any info you might have.

Thanks,

Greg
