I've done it and verify it can be done, BUT it is more trouble than it is
worth unless you absolutely cannot remove the enginefor some reason

it is rather trial and error, to get the upper head bolts I use a long
extender on my socket wrench (torque wrench) carefully bend metal so you
can bend it back when you put it back in.
