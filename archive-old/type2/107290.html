&gt; I was looking over my vacuum hoses today and quickly came to the conclusion
&gt; that they pretty much all need to be replaced. They're dried, cracked and
&gt; plain worn out. I was looking over your article on the vacuum hoses. Great
&gt; info and just what I needed. I was wondering if you had replaced all of your
&gt; hoses?

Yes, all but two. The NLA molded hose from the s-boot to the decel valve and
the NLA molded hose from the s-boot to the oil breather. The latter failed
on me and a list angel was kind enough to supply a replacement.

&gt;If so where were you able to find all the different sizes? I noticed
&gt; that some of the hoses had part numbers listed. Are those still available from
&gt; the dealer? Thanks for any wisdom.

I'm sure some size are still available at the dealer as they must still be
in common with modern VWs.

I measured all the nipples and connectors because hose was hard to find and
I wanted a list I could fit hose to in the future. There are only a few
sizes available. I'm sure if you hunted down every European make you'd find
all the sizes.

I got some small pieces from Bus Boys and some locally. Between the two I
covered all the hoses, except the two NLA molded hoses.

VWFLAPS:

3.5mm, 4.5mm (maybe 5mm I can't recall), 7mm, 12mm

Bus Boys:

B. Hose, Valve to Plastic Tube
Hose/Boot - Center Air Plenum to Air Intake Runners
Hose - From Air Intake Elbow Boot to Aux Air Control Valve
Hose Elbow - Aux Air Control Valve to Hose above
Hose - Aux Air Valve to Center Air Plenum

P.S. I updated my webpage with some more hose info.
