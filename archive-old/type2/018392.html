Subject: Re: Pacesetter Extractor?

   Bus Depot has the Pacesetter for $79,95, and another one for $53.95
for the extractor and $44.95 for the muffler for it, and that one is
also sold by RMMW for a little more. His web page says &quot;Excellent
Quality&quot; for the Pacesetter, but not for the more expensive 2 part one.
So I don't know.
     Finally got a price from S&amp;S -- $122.  I don't really mind paying
more if it's decent. Don't want a OE type, prefer the extractor, and
don't need the O2 sensor port.
       The one I've got is a &quot;GT  Sport&quot; type from RMMW w/ 2 mufflers --
I thought it'd be quieter, but it's not and it breaks at the welds.
         Where is the ANSA sold -- I've never heard of it before. It's
an extractor? Price?
