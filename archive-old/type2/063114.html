Subject: rolling the van

I've never even come close to rolling a van. But my youngest brother rolled his
split by going up on a traffic sign, which lifted him gently up and over at
about 30 mph.  My older younger brother rolled one in germany sliding on the ice
into a ditch (his buddy somehow ended up under the van in the small space
between the van and the bottom of the ditch).  A buddy of mine went on the
shoulder with his '74 and came back on the road too sharply, tripped and ended
up sliding a  long way on three points( passenger door handle, air scoop and
some other part I can;t remember)  the door handle was worn down to almost
nothing.  John Jensen in Annapolis
