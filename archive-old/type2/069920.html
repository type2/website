But, yes.. I am putting dropped spindles on it and a '68 IRS transaxle 
and Cal Look seals.  I'm not going to modify or shave the body in any way 
though.

Not really sure what I am going to do right now.. my main reasoning for 
lowering it is to improve stability when cruising on the highway.. 90% of 
my driving here in Mpls is all highway.. we have highways everywhere and 
it gets pretty windy at times.  Anything I can do to make it stick to the 
road better, I will do as I hate white knuckles. ;-)

never heard *anyone* tell me honestly their vw handled better after lowering,
but have heard the opposite.     Best thing is to have the steering
components all in good order.

god forbid - what is a 'cal look' seat?  anyway
