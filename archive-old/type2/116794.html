Subject: Re: [T2] STRANGE OCCURANCE

&gt;what happened? or what might cause this strange occurance?
&gt;It has started and ran good ever since.

I have had similiar problems with my bus, I call it personality.

Because it died when you are driving, my thought is that there is a problem 
with the electrical system, maybe your coil or your points (if you are 
running points).

When it died and you would try to start, was the starter spinning or was 
nothing happening at all? Did your oil and gen light come on?
