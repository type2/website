Subject: AM bug engine into 68 crew cab?
Date: Thu, 15 Oct 1998 01:29:58 -0400

Will have a free AM 09x xxx xxx case bug eng tomorrow, to put in the rusty
$300 crew cab we just got. This isn't my dream engine, but will have to do
for now. Reading archives was great help in trying to understand the
obstacles to be overcome. Anyone know off hand if the AM engine has the boss
surfaces required for using it in a bus? Will be able to see for myself
tomorrow evening....but please direct mail me if you know the answer to this
and/or have warnings that may not be in the archives.

TIA, Marv Krupp..about to get that sucker moving sooner than expected.
