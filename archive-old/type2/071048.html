Some ideas..
1. muffler noise- leak in exhaust system, probably where muffler joins or/and 
too rich a fuel mix. I have found the same when I had a slight leak from an 
exhaust gasket.
2. idle problem- this could be a variety of things. I recently had the same 
thing and this was the fuel cut-out on the Carb (pict 3). It was not screwed 
tight into the carb and letting air in -and so losing some vacuum. I 
tightened it up and was OK straight away. May also be your idle adjustment - 
thats described in Muir etc or archives.
3. Do your lights flicker at any other time? Maybe earthing fault (ground 
wires on the headlights) or regulator on the way out ... not sure about this
