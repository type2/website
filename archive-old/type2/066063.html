Hey all:
Anyone out there into aviation who would be willing to snag an extra one of 
those &quot;Dead Stop&quot; or &quot;Stop Dead&quot; or &quot;Head Shop&quot; or whatever they are called 
things? I really would like one as I suspect my 73 Bug is trying to kill me, 
but I don't hang around airports much. OK, I don't hang around them at all. 
So if anyone has an extra, I'll pay for it and the shipping too.
