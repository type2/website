Volks,

One thing I noticed as I was wading thru all that back mail was the 
number of cross-posts between this and the vintagebus list.  In many 
instances this is entirely appropriate.  For example:

VW camping events and shows are of interest to all;  

for-sale of any bus, whatever era, is fine; 

engine questions are OK (we got 1600DP engines, they {alas} usually have
1600DP engines; 

even bodywork questions and answers (face it, sheet metal is sheet
metal)..... 

BUT if the words &quot;reduction box&quot; or &quot;lever shock&quot;  occur in your post,
consider whether it is appropriate for a list devoted to bay-window
busses, please.  (unless you are considering retrofitting your '79 with
redux boxes :-)
