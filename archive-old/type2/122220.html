Subject: Distributor timing nut

Dumb querstion #23:  the 2&quot; distributor nut that you  undo to move the 
distributor to time it: can that nut and clamp be moved around the base of 
the distributor??  Like, I want to mive it 90 degrees counter clockwise.


My 2&quot; nut seems to be right under the 'bisket' on the distributor, making 
ther nut kind of hard to get at .
