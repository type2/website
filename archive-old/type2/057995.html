you're all right.

let me try to confuse you more er, i mean, clear this up :-)

the first example is the tdc mark on the pulley being lined up with the
stationary timing scale at 5 ATDC.

the second is 5 ATDC on a degreed pulley being lined up with with the
case seam.

let me try to make a better diagram:

9876543210123456789                        |

              T                        987654321T123456789
	      D 		                D
              C                                 C


now in both cases, TDC is past the mark or the zero, but the relation of
the five to the &quot;0&quot; or &quot;TDC&quot; on the scale is backwards... the first is
for a type 4, the second is a type 1 with a degreed pulley
