That's what my bus has on her 2L and it seems to be running pretty well now
except for a minor problem with stalling at idle.

Anyway, the &quot;Adjustment Data Table&quot; that came with the rebuild kit listed
the following vehicles as having this carb.  This is for the benefit of
those wanting to do a junkyard search.

71 Capri 2L, Pinto 2L w/AC
72 &amp; 73 Capri-Pinto 2L, Capri 2.6L
74 Bobcat-Capri-Pinto 2L, Bobcat-Mustang II-Pinto 2.3L, Capri-MustangII 2.8L
75 Capri-Mustang-Pinto 2.3L
76 Bobcat-Pinto-Capri 2.3L

Results not guaranteed.

72 bus, &quot;Maureen&quot;
