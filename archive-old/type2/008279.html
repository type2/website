&gt; hey 
&gt; does anyone know if the middle side bay windows on bay window buses,
are 
&gt; interchangable throughout the years 68-79? i mean will a 69 buses
middle 
&gt; side windows fit in the side of a 72?
&gt; sorry if this is hard to understand, but i'm in a hurry.

YES. They will. I know for a fact that they will because I pulled the
side windows out of a 78-79 and put them in my 70. I also pulled some
out of a 73 and put them in a 70. All baywindows have the same glass
opening, some had different glass (78 or 79 sliders) but they all
interchange. You can pull out flat glass and install louvers or
sliders or the other way around too.
