Hi all
As I began tracking down my various oil leaks I found that there
is a small leak on the top of the engine. It appears to be coming
from the oil filler neck? Is there a gasket or something
I can replace? Thanks...........

Chip,

Check the oil pressure sender, by the distributor, at about the ten 
o'clock position.

If it's cracked, it'll usually leak slowly at first until it ruptures, 
when it'll look a little like a Texas wildcatter's well coming in.

The sender costs only about $5, one size fits all for air-cooled VWs.  
You'll need to pull the wire attached to its terminal and use a 15/16&quot; 
deep-well socket to get the thing out.

Hope that's it, 'cause it's by far the easiest and cheapest solution.  
Otherwise, it could be the oil cooler or its gaskets, or several other 
things.
