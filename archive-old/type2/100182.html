Subject: Re: [T2] Good karma, dead bus.

First off, you should probably be using normal bosch plugs.  Check the
list archives on this, but the consensus seems to be that platinum foul
a lot easier in the air-cooled and don't make your engine run any better
(for air-cooleds).

My first guess is that after the bus is warmed up, the choke isn't 
opening
or is stuck.  This would cause the behavior you're describing.  If the
plugs have fouled, that's a symptom -- sure he might have caused them
to foul, but i'm not sure the choke didn't just die or the wire didn't 
just fall
off of it.  If the bus is running, it's probably not going to be the 
coil.

I'd go back to basics:  Fuel &amp; Spark

Fuel:
make SURE he didn't fiddle with the mixture screw, because that could
be affecting all of this.
1) choke -- is the choke opening after the bus is warmed up?
2) does the bus run with the air-cleaner detached?  If there's a clog
	in your air-cleaner, you could also be running rich and not running 
right.

Spark:
1) verify spark from the coil
2) check the points (with a dwell meter if you've got one) and spark 
plug wire connectors.
3) check the plugs for fouling.

Also, clogged heat-riser tubes will cause a bus to run poorly, not warm 
up
properly and otherwise not run right.  This could cause your plug fouling
because the carb doesn't warm up fast enough, the choke doesn't 
disengage,
and you get too rich a mixture.

hope this helps,
	tom
