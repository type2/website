&gt; I seem to recall that a &quot;square engine&quot; (bore and stroke as close to the
&gt; same as possible) was desirable for high torque uses in V8's.
&gt; 
&gt; Hopefully someone will chime in with some real experience for our ACVWs. -)

It doesn't matter what kind of engine really, aircooled, watercooled, but
oversquare engines will rev more easily while (closer to) square will make
power at lower rpm and top out sooner. There is no acvw engine I am aware of
that is actually square, but you notice as the type 4 bus engines got bigger
and then morphed into the Vanagon water boxer, they got closer to square,
and better because of it. Upright bus engines were all closer to square than
any type 4.
