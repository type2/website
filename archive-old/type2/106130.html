Subject: Re: [T2] Silver socket wattage

&gt; It's not a 12 volt, it's for the
&quot;shore power&quot; plug in
from the outside, the breaker
shuts it off

I believe Richard said he had a 12v outlet NEXT to the 120V box. 

&gt; what's weird about page 9 is the 3 bulb flourecent light, that was only
on euro models.

It came on USA 79 models. Perhaps this was a late-78 printing of the manual?
