Subject: RE: [T2] Bending fuel line

Take the new metal line and bend it over something round like a pipe. The 
diameter of the pipe or round object should be twice the radius you want. 
But if using this method try to hold the tube being bent as close the round 
object as possible. Do it slowy and make sure you are not getting any flat 
spots in the tube at the bend. Or you could simply go to your FLAPS and get 
a brake line bender, probably less than $10 and it has many uses.

Good Luck and Happy Holidays,

&gt;Due to the fuel leak I had last week, I replaced all flexible fuel lines
&gt;exept from the metal fuel line going through the firewall. This metal line 
&gt;I
&gt;had to order and it will arrive later this week.
&gt;I will have to curve this line for 90 degrees; do I need a special tool to
&gt;do this? I tried to bend the old line and it was quite easy to do. Any tips
&gt;on this one?
