&gt; Hey, that's normal, but then again what do I know, I thought keepings 
&gt; bits and pieces of previously owned VW's was EXPECTED.

&gt; &gt; Frosted Flakes commercials. :)   I even keep parts in my garage from
&gt; &gt; the '68 bug I used to have.  I know I'll probably never use them again,
&gt; &gt; but I just can't let them go.....  Am I insane?

Sincerely,
