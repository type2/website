When I rebuilt my engine, I had a piece of plywood on a small frame with
caster wheels at each corner.  It was so nice being able to move the engine
around the garage.  For removal, I stacked a couple of 2x12x12 blocks on my
floor jack and was able to balance the engine.  Then two of us moved the
engine from the jack to my little roll around piece of plywood.  Use your
imagination.
