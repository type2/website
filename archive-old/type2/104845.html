&gt; &gt;   It's nice, because in California, there's no smog for up to '73, and so I

&gt;NO NO NO! You are totally mistaken. You LEGALLY cannot modify any 66-73 
&gt;vehicle in California. There is a BIG
&gt;difference between having to do the biennial smog check and the smog law.

Karl's right on here.  I got pulled over by a cop that mistook me for 
someone else then proceeded to pick apart my double cab looking for 
violations to justify pulling me over.  Got a big lecture on &quot;modifying 
engines&quot;, &quot;removing smog equipment&quot;, &quot;most people don't realize....&quot;  When 
I told him that it was a 1960, he switched back to the mufflers and being 
too loud.  I ended up getting out of the ticket, but it took up about 15 
minutes of my time.

&gt;Yes, Remote Sensing is coming.....
&gt;
&gt;And if an idiot named Senato Florez gets his way, all vehicles from 1960 
&gt;will require a smog check!!

&gt;He wants to repeal SB42!!!!


Idiot, this guy is nuts.  Cars 45 years and older are exempted.  I didn't 
think any smog equipment started showing up on cars until 63/64.
