Hi all -

OK, here goes:  might anyone know where a longish (in the vicinity of the 
top crankshaft bolts length) bolt w/a three prong ground (?) attachment 
might go?  I'm in the process of putting everything back on my motor.  I 
have my Vanagon ('80 Westfalia) at one location, rebuilt motor at another, 
in the garage.  I'd brought a box of parts over to the engine location &amp; saw 
this bolt.  I can't for the life of my recall where it came off of.  Help?  
I imagine I can look for something off of the harness, but where would the 
bolt go?  Maybe it's from the alternator (?)...

Also:  as I was tightening the intake tubes down on the 1 &amp; 2 cyl side, the 
outside nut began to spin on the #1.  Yes, I know it's supposed to be _at_ 15 
lbs (I checked...after it spun).  I wasn't totally cranking the thing.  
Anyhow, I backed the nut off &amp; used pliers to screw the stud further into 
the head.  I tightened the nut back down (a little more gently) &amp; it seems 
solid.  Should I toss &amp; turn about this?

Thanks,

Mark
