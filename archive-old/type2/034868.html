Subject: Free curtain

Gentle listvolks,

I am giving away the very orange front curtain that came with my 74 Westy - the
one that goes from window to window across the windshield.  The snaps at each
end of the gathers, plus the one on the lower right that would snap onto the
passenger window frame, are missing.  First p-mail gets it - all I ask is $3 to
cover shipping.
