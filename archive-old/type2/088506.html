Subject: Re: [T2] RE:  914 motor into a bus (was 0mile engine)

Bus 2.0 are dished.
914 2.0 are flat top.
Also the combustion chambers are totally different, as well as the placement
and angle of the spark plugs.


&gt; Hello List,
&gt;
&gt; When I went I bought the 2L 914 motor earlier this
&gt; week, I asked the garage owner what the differences
&gt; were between a bus 2L and a 914 2L. He started looking
&gt; up and comparing vw part numbers and found that 914 2L
&gt; pistons and 2L bus pistons were different. Can any one
&gt; verify this? If so, does any one know if the Porsche
&gt; pistons were dished or different in any way? It is
&gt; possible that he was mistaken but I wanted to check.
&gt; If they are different, would they be part of the
&gt; reason that the compression ratio is higher?
&gt; BTW, he did also note the difference in the heads when
&gt; he looked up the numbers.
