Subject: Re: [T2] please help... dying at idle again...

&gt; Another bus guy and I thought we had the problem solved yesterday; he
&gt; unplugged the O2 sensor and the thing ran like a champ. I drove it the
&gt; rest of the day yesterday and most of the day today without incident,
&gt; until this evening.

I was going to suggest the lambda sensor before I even got to this.

There's a test for it (what voltage it generates cold, warm, hot, etc)
but it's kinda like testing the Temp2 sensor. Ranges. Difficult to
nail down.

But for $30, you can get a new one from BD:
http://www.busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=11027

It's cheap because it's shared among all VWs until the mid 80's IIRC.

I dunno if the test is in the Bentley, but it'll be around somewhere.
