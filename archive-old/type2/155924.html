&gt; I have about a 1/4&quot; by 2&quot; crack in my air intake boot where it curves at

&gt;

I've repaired 2 now using this method. I've also done it on my Saab
and my Volvo and the Volvo ran 2 years with this:

Silicone of your choice. Shoe Goo sounds like it would rock. But I
used whatever I had handy.

Purchase some silicone tape. It has no adhesive, but instead bonds to
itself when wrapped VERY tightly.

Clean the whole thing with degreaser then wipe with alcohol. Apply
just enough silicone to fill the crack(s) and a wee bit more. Let dry
overnight at least. Then apply a skim coat of the silicone all the way
around the s-boot. Even where there are no cracks. Make sure it's
about 1/8&quot; thick. Let dry overnight. Wrap with 3 layers of the
silicone tape. I'd coat everything with a good rubber protectant (NOT
Armor-All) to reduce future cracks.

The skim coat gives a huge sealing surface so if for whatever reason
the silicone in the crack itself comes loose the skim coat keeps it
sealed. The silicone tape backs THAT up and also provides a good solid
structure to minimize flex.
