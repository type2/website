Subject: Pouring oil
Message-ID: &lt;C51ED84B6F47D211917A0000F8BCBD11011F4C93_at_zcard00g_dot_ca.nortel_dot_com&gt;

Regarding pouring oil. Although maybe not germane to the getting oil into
your van, FWIW:

Most oil containers, paint thinner cans etc. have the  spout off to one
side.
It seems the natural instinct to pour with the spout down, 
but the bugger starts to pour while still almost upright meaning you've got 
to aim at the hole from quite high up.
However if you flip the can around and tilt it with the spout up, you can
tip it almost 
90 degrees bafore it starts to pour, meaning you can lower the can spout
very close to the 
target before it starts to pour, drastically increasing your first strike
accuracy.
Enyways. Mr. Rowe my grade six shop teacher said tjis is the &quot;right way to
pour&quot;,
and it sure cuts down on the rags bill.
