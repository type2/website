&gt; Where'd you get those figures?  The 1500 S engine was used with all dual

directly from VW while I lived in Germany in the 60's

&gt; carb Type 3s in '64 &amp; '65.  The compression ratio was 8.5:1 and put out 54
&gt; b.p.h. (DIN) / 66 b.p.h. (SAE).  During this time the 7.8:1 single carb
&gt; version was still being produced.  Almost all of the 14,240 Type 3 Ghias
&gt; produced during those years were of the 1500 S variety.  A few single carb
&gt; T34s were undoubtedly produced for countries without access to higher octane
&gt; gas but no sales brochures mention this version.  Pinning a total production
&gt; on the rest of the Type 3 line would be harder because both models were
&gt; offered but 10,000 engines for the whole Type 3 line is certainly a very low
&gt; number.  For the '66 model year, VW found they could keep the horsepower
&gt; virtually the same by bumping the P/Cs up to 85s (1600cc) and lowering the
&gt; compression.

evidently there were different engines offered  that may have carried the
&quot;S&quot; designation... the engine I am referring to had an engine code of
&quot;X&quot;  I &quot;Grey&quot; market imported the engine from Germany by putting it into
my VW and bringing it back that way.   believe me I found out how hard it
was to maintain as most parts for the engine had to be special ordered
from Germany through my VW dealer...  and this was in the late 60's early
70's that I had this engine.   Wish I were a little more savy then and had
kept more of the information when I sold it.  There is no way this engine
could have been in any &quot;consumer&quot; car  dang thing was always in need of
tuning etc.  

BTW I had it in a FibreFab Avenger body on a 2inch square steel tube frame
and raced it F-3, G-3, less than 1.5L.  I was once clocked at 127MPH so
this was not your stock set up, my race weight was 1,111lbs.
   When I sold it, with a dropped rod I got enough to pay all of my bills
for a semester in college including my tuition and books.
