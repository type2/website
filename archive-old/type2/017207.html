&gt; Matt,
&gt;   I'm a little unclear about what is amiss for you here, by your description.
&gt;   First, your valves should be adjusted right along with all the other tune-up
&gt; ditties, every 3,000 miles.
&gt;   Second, did you have a friend helping you? Did you line up your rotor, TDC,
&gt; et all? You got to where you oughtta be firing at #1 cylinder, yes? And you
&gt; say the valves didn't open? Do it again, from the beginning, and lay under
&gt; that right side and *watch* your #1 valves move as the engine is hand-cranked
&gt; COUNTERCLOCKWISE. You'll see it move with the engine.
&gt;   Now, if you mean that you did all that and couldn't get your feeler gauge in
&gt; there, then it's just too tight! Did ya try the .004 blade? Try that and
&gt; you'll *know* it's too tight! Then just get your 13mm (or 14mm) and loosen
&gt; that locking nut (go easy, knuckles beware), and then with your screwdriver,
&gt; turn the slot to the left to widen that gap until you can get your .006 in
&gt; there.
&gt;   Be mindful: if you aren't able to turn the slot there because the locking
&gt; nut is turning with it, then you need to work those two apart first by holding
&gt; still the locking nut and turning the slot w/ your screwdriver the loose way,
&gt; like that, until they both do their job.

Matthew, Rachel:
I've found a big help in adjusting valves is to get a screwdriver with a
cross-handle on it. This exact tool happens to be the chain adjusting
tool that came with my Stihl 020 chainsaw. I'm quite certain that anyone
can purchase such a tool at your friendly Stihl chainsaw dealer for
about $6.00 US. It's just a medium blade screwdriver with a combo
sparkplug socket-13mm. socket welded across the end to form the handle.
Using the cross-handle allows a little more leverage and much more
control of small movements of the screwdriver blade. (Those screws tend
to be a bit sticky.) It's also a handy 13mm. socket wrench. It's made in
Germany, so it should feel some extra kinship while lying under your
seat with the lug wrench.(For those of you who feel that wrench karma is
important.)
If this helps an old salt such as myself, I'm certain it should make the
job easier for a novice.
