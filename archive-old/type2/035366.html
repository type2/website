&gt; Anybody have experience with the enhanced ignition system
&gt; advertized in J.C. Whipme? For about $250, the Jacobs Electronics
&gt; device called &quot;Omni Magnum Team&quot; is supposed to boost your
&gt; mileage and horsepower. It claims to do this by &quot;adding a small 
&gt; computer and coil system that measures the spark resistance 
&gt; at each plug, sending just the right number of joules to the 
&gt; spark plug.&quot; Sounds a little like wizardry to me. Maybe I'm
&gt; wrong. Is it worth $250?

Well, in the case of spark energy, too much is just fine.  You don't
need a computer to figure out how many joules to deliver to each plug,
you just give each plug the maximum energy that your system can supply
safely.  It certainly doesn't cost $250 to do this.

Let's say that this system gives you an additional mile per gallon
(that's a 5% improvement).  How long would it take to save $250 in gas?

Well, at $1.50 a gallon, the cost per mile at 20MPG is $0.075 per mile.
 At 21MPG, the cost is $0.071429 per mile, a difference of $0.003571
per mile.

At this rate, it would take 70,000 miles to pay off the $250, assuming
that the device works as advertised and that it lasts the 70,000 miles.

IMHO, it's kind of a long shot.  Unless I saw an independent test of
the device by a reputable organization I wouldn't go for it.
