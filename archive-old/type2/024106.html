A couple weeks ago I posted on my '78 FI hesitating, it would seem that my 
fuel pump was not operating at maximum efficiency.  It was working, but it 
was weak, not supply enough fuel.  Anyway, after a new fuel pump some new 
fuel lines, and the FI system completely cleaned out, I'm back in my daily 
ride.
