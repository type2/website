Subject: Battery tray

Since there has been some discussion on how to replace and the best way to
replace your battery tray since they all seem to go, I thought that I would
forward the preventative measure that I took concerning my battery tray on
my 74.  While the engine was out for its rebuild, I decided that I should
go through the whole engine compartment and clean and paint any areas that
need it.  Needless to say that my battery tray is pretty well shot due to
the battery acid leaking and causing corrosion.  After I cleaned it all up
and put rust protection on it, I went down to my local boat store and
bought a plastic battery holder that my battery would fit into.  This
plastic holder fits into the area of the battery tray like a glove.  The
one thing that you cannot do however, is bolt your battery down which was
no problem for me since the bracket was long gone.  Since then, the battery
in its plastic case has not moved at all, plus there is no chance for any
battery acid to come in contact with the battery tray.

Just an idea.
