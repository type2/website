Subject: Re: [T2] Was Hard to Crank. Now FLOATING TIMING

Weights seem to be ok. Nothing looks amiss. Anything else that would cause
floating timing? Would a simple vacuum leak do that? I can't find any leaks,
but c'mon, I'm bound to have at least one! :)

Oh yeah, how do you tell if your running rich or lean without special
instruments on a fuel injected bus? Or don't you?

&gt; Your weights inside the distributor might be jacked up.  I'd take a look
&gt; inside the distributor and make sure they're still attached and
&gt; functioning like they should.
