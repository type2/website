Subject: Front Axle Beam Replacement

With two posts today on the subject, I want to remind everyone of the
article I did some years ago on how to do this.  It is in the type2
library..  got to the library, then suspension, then front axle beam.  the
beam can still be had for ~$600 new at last check, and good used ones seem
to be $100-150.  Last time I did this (3 years ago), I checked and a
mechanic wanted $300 for the beam and $300 labor, total $600.  I regard
that as pretty fair even if you split it as $150 for the beam and $450 for
labor... it is a labor intensive job, like so many other VW tasks.  If you
want to do it at home, there is nothing too difficult, it is just very big
and very heavy... have 3 people on hand!!!
