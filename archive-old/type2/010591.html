	If it isn't broke, don't fix it. ;)

	WHY rebuild? Lack of power? A rebuilt VW can be considered
'as new' if you do the whole Magilla, or something between new and
used if you economize. I'm not sure $900 is enough budget for a
type IV once you start. 

Obvious things to price out are 

pistons and cylinders, 
rebuilt heads, 
new bearings for crank and rods, 
new clutch (as long as you've taken it apart)
new oil pump
new seals, gaskets
new cam followers
exhaust studs, head studs, and other hardware

After which its a new engine. 

a CHEAP rebuild would be new pistons and cylinders, valve work
if necceary, leave the case halves bolted together. I've helped do
one, and it worked because the problem was bad rings.

	You really ought to invest in a compression test of all four
cylinders, which you can do yourself with a friend, before making
this decision. A 'leak down' test doesn't hurt. Also try the spark
plug wire test- with the engine at idle, disconnect each spark plug
wire in turn. RPM should drop for each one disconnected. If it doesn't
change, you've got a LAZY cylinder! You'd want to do all this research
before considering a rebuild- if the numbers say the engines OK
then there's nothing to be gained by a rebuild. If the numbers say
not ok, they'll also hint what the problems (and expenses) are likely
to be.

	Happy motoring!
	Bill
