my 78 2L doesn't leak a drop and I use 5-50 synthetic...doesn't take any
tricks just to carefully put the pieces VW did in correctly.  I gennerally
do not put any oil in between changes, it just doesn't need it, I am
almost ready for my next oil change and the oil is still right at the full
line.   not bragging (ok a little) I have seen a lot of type IV engines
just as tight.

&gt; Anyone out there that has a 2.0 that doesn't leak? This is not a survey.
&gt; Just trying to prove to my neighbor that all VW's don't mark their spot. Any
&gt; advice appreciated.

yer, neighbor is wrong
