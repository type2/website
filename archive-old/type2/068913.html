        You are confusing the computer with the 009.By having the timing 
at 7.5 at idle when the computer is programed for 10 deg. ATDC (5 deg. 
AT)it probably is trying to enrich the mixture in almost all speed ranges.
Pull a couple of plug and look at them. If they are all black (sooty or 
shinny) then I would recommend going back to the stock distributor.

&gt; Got a couple of questions:
&gt;  
&gt; 1. Hubby just put a Bosch 009 distributor in my 78 (2L) bus. What should
&gt; the advance be set at? Right now it's set at 7.5 degrees.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. When running, the bus seems just fine...but when idling (doesn't matter
&gt; if it's in gear or not) she doesn't seem to idle without burps or &quot;farts&quot;.
&gt; She just doesn't idle smoothly....any suggestions/advice to help with this
&gt; problem?
&gt;  
&gt; BTW....hubby decided to customize the exhaust on her. Now she has dual
&gt; exhausts!
