&gt;I hear this all the time and it saddens me.  Buses were made for road
&gt;trips!  If your bus is in good shape it is far less likely to give you
&gt;problems on the road than it is around town!  If you drive sensibly (keep
&gt;speeds under 60, take your time on hills) you will not be stressing your
&gt;bus as much as you do on the way to the supermarket.

The one exception to this is front wheel bearings.  Check them before 
leaving on any long trips and take spares.  Other than that, I agree, get 
out there and drive!
