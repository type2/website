&gt;List,
&gt;After the votes of confidence I received from this
&gt;list as well as other forums, I am ready to take on
&gt;the task of assembling my own engine.


&gt;   Any other words of wisdom?

Want a leak free engine?? Get a German gasket and seal set, throw away the 
flywheel, pulley and push rod tube seals and get the better Viton or 
silicon seals. Make sure the seal surface on the crank and pulley are 
nicely polished, but not a mirror finish, about 600 grit.

Use new push rod tubes. Glue the valve cover gaskets to the covers with 3M 
Weather Strip Adhesive, the yellow elephant snot stuff. Same for the 
breather box cork gasket.

Chamfer the entry for the flywheel and pulley/fan seals. When done right, 
you can aline them quickly and push them in with thumbs and fingers.

Get the Porsche case sealant, I don't care how much it costs. It seals for 
sure up to 0.5mm imperfections and pops clean for rebuilding. Locktite 
Germany makes it for Porsche. Locktite no. is 571. Some of the Porsche 
specialty providers will have it.

Expect weapage from the cylinder bases. I've not yet tried 571 here and I 
think it is worth an experiment. Shoot some Gunk in there every year or two 
and flush with water for continuous clean bottom side. Pull the tin off the 
exchangers to do a better job.

Don't forget the oring in the back of the flywheel before you put it on. 
(That's for T-IV motors only).

No RTV at all anywhere in the motor assembly, PLEASE. I doesn't work and is 
a nightmare to remove and clean at subsequent teardown.
