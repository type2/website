Subject: FS '69 westy near philly and the bus depot needs tran

orange and white 69 westy
garaged since 95 in ok shape
needs a transmission supposedly, the guy who tried to get it running for me 
said it had a ring and pinion problem.
I just can't like putting any money into it while my driver driver is dying 
beside it.
If not a running vehicle then a great source for parts and god boby pieces.
