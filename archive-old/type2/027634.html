I just recently recieved a remanufactured dizzy. The serial number on the 
side states it is for a BUG. I own a 1980 Westy and just had the motor 
rebuilt but have not installed it yet. My rebuilder put in a 009 inplace of 
my shot vacuum advance stock dizzy. I want to put in a stock dizzy. The 
vendor I bought the stock remanufactured dizzy from states that the outside 
of the dizzy is that same for several models (where the serial number is 
stamped) but the inards of my dizzy are different and correct for my van. 
How can I verify this????
