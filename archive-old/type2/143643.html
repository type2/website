Subject: Re: [T2] microbus news 

Honestly, I don't think this &quot;Why won't they
just sell us a simple, unadorned, repair-friendly
bus!?&quot; could be said with the word &quot;bus&quot; replaced
by just about anything from appliances to operating
systems to medicines to cellphones to ...

Competition drives the profit out of the basic
good, so bells and whistles must be added if the
margins are to be large enough to stock purchases
by shareholders (which is to say equity financing
rather than debt financing).  I do not like this,
but it seems as predictable as the sun rising
in the east or, for that matter, frost tonight
here in Boston.
