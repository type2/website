&gt; Is it possible to rebuild a distributor?  In this case a Bosch 205T.

Maybe. Depends on what you want to rebuild.  It also depends on the
distributor.  If the dist has too much up-down play, it can be reshimmed
at home in your spare time.  If it has side-to-side wobble in the shaft,
AFAIK, then is no rebuild kit, tho a pro can proibably come up with the
correct bushings.

&gt; Do Flaps or the online joints have rebuild kits for these things?

Yes!  Anyplace that carries Bosch parts can order part # 1 237 010 007
Wich is the shim set.  If your problem is too much vertical play in the
shaft, this will clear it right up.

&gt; Or is there an auto electrical service which rebuilds dizzys?

Yes!  There are several.  If you go to Olympic Auto parts
(www.forparts_dot_com) and get their number, they can get and mail you a
rebuilt distributor for many VW distributors.  Others may be able to do th
same (I've been pushing at least one vendor on the list to carry these :-)
