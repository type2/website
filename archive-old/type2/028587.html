Okay, I give up. I forgot to mark the rear engine mounting crossmember and now I don't know which direction it should go. One side of the crossmember is nice and curvy; the other side is pretty straight. Does the curved side go on the passenger or driver side of the bus?

Please bear with me over the next week or so. I'll be asking more dumb questions...though I am searching the archives first!

Thanks! Joe
