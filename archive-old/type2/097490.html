&gt; Hi all:
&gt;
&gt; I understand the TypeIV thermostat is generally NLA.  However, there was
&gt; discussion on the list that the old upright engine thermostats, which
*are*
&gt; available, could be substituted with a little judicious modification.
&gt;
&gt; I recently was looking at the on-line catalog for California Imports and
&gt; looked up the thermostat for the Beetle engine.  The picture that
&gt; accompanied the listing didn't look anything like the TypeIV thermostat
and
&gt; the text stated &quot;new style design - does not look like the original&quot;,
which
&gt; certainly was true.
&gt;
&gt; Can this thermostat be used in the TypeIV engine with similar
modification?
