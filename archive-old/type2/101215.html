Subject: Rock tumbler parts cleaning

The results are in.  Because a few of you folks brought up the fact that rock 
tumbers are meant to take rough rocks and make smooth shiny ones, I tried an 
experiment with some old nasties that I had lying around.

If you roll them over a day with coarse grit abrasive you get nice shiny 
oblong metal pieces that have no threads or heads left to speak of.

A day with fine grit does a great job of obliterating threads and taking 
edges off of heads.

Walnut shells work fine but don't really remove pitted rust, but I didn;t 
expect them to.  I used shells from walnuts lying all over the Karmarosa 
since I have walnut trees.  the insides are yummy though...

Result and conclusion?
I think I'll just soak in hi-test carb cleaner, chase the threads, and oil 
lightly a-la Clara

thanks y'all for your insights!
