Subject: Nicknames

Our van got her name in an unusual way. My partner and I had respectively our
own vans, his was Oscar and mine, Georgia. As time went on we aquired &quot;Jeremy&quot;
the parts van, &quot;Francois&quot; named after the fellow we aquired him from, and
&quot;Noah&quot; the fastback. Meanwhile, &quot;Oscar&quot; and &quot;Georgia&quot; were our babies and as
the others came and went, we always had these. However, they were getting very
worn out and unsafe. One day, a friend of ours appeared and offered us his
sundial van which had been parked under cover for a few years and had no
motor. We accepted and after much reflection my brialliant partner undertook a
huge transplant operation. &quot;Goskoria&quot; was born from &quot;Oscar&quot; and &quot;Georgia&quot; and
consists of all of their organs. She resembles her parents but has a vibe of
her own!
