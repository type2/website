&gt; Hiya All!
&gt; 
&gt; I'm looking for the sheathed cable which connected the thermostat (via an arm
&gt; located at the lower right of the fan shroud) to the air filter preheater
&gt; flap on the stock set-up for a 1970 Bus.  I'm not sure (VW seemed to tinker
&gt; with this set-up a lot) but I believe this was also stock in 69 and 71.
