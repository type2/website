Subject: Re: A plea concerning area codes and for-sale listings

&gt;New area codes are popping up all the time [Oregon now has a second one],
&gt;and I never had that many memorized in the first place.  And I'm probably
&gt;not alone.  As a favor [I'm watching FS's for a couple of friends around
&gt;the country, and I bet I'm not alone in this concern], could people flag
&gt;their posts and reposts of FS notices at least with the state or metro
&gt;area--in the subject line? 

And the YEAR of the bus, too!
