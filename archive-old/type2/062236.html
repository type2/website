Subject: Copenhagen to Lillehammer and back in the 61.

        Just returned from a quick weekend trip to Lillehammer in Norway.
In all we totaled  1480 kilometers which consumed 157.28 liters of gas and
a half liter of 20W 50. Total gas bill amounted to 1500 crowns ( or
approximately $275 USA).
        On the road we spotted countless baywindows and transported but
only three other splits. One was in the traffic in Oslo headed the other
way. Lene, the kids and I were waving away, but received nothing in return
beyond a puzzled look. The second split was one Lene had spotted earlier
this spring, sitting out back of the hospital in Lillehammer. Its a mid
50's panel. Nice and rough. To bad but it had that abandoned look about
her. Its probably facing one more arctic winter before its off to the
crusher.
        The last split was with German plates. We didn't get a good look as
we raced (change that optimistic word to rolled) by. It was resting at a
pullover, and be were maintaining our constant 95 kilometers per hour. It
had a poptop and what might have been an unorthodox paint job.
        All in all a nice run for s. The 1200 cc did there required job,
without any surprises. I did get a little worried about the incline we
ascended the mountains behind Lillehammer. Truly one of the steepest runs
I've ever attemped. Took about 20 minutes in 1st and 2nd. But we were cool
and calm all the way. The GPS we had on the dash showed that we climbed 750
meter in six kilometers! Quite a contrast from flat Denmark.
        Driving conditions in Norway are suspended in the 1950s. The top
speed limit on the highway is 90 and often reduced to 80. What a pleasure
knowing one doesn't have to worry about the queue building behind. Everyone
is content to hold their position. The one odd driving characteristic of
norwegians which I'll never understand is the rule of yielding to right.
Although predominately defunct in the urban centres, the rule is to give
priority to all traffic entering from the right You can be cruising along a
main route and you'll notice a vehicle ahead on a road perpendicular to
yourself. Without warning this vehicle will suddenly drive out in front of
you. Last summer we saw a photo of a beautiful 59 split camper that was
nailed in the side in such a situation. Sadly though you'll swear that all
logic dictates you are not to blame you'll be charged with careless
driving.
        Anyway that's was our trip. Don't be put off by the weirdness of
norwegian traffic rules. It remains one of the most beautiful places to
drive, in the world.
