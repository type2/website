Subject: new contact info and a big THANK YOU

Hello folks,

As some of you may know we have had customer service phone hours from 10am
to 10pm M-F and 9am-8pm on Sat and Sun. Also there where two phone numbers
303-530-1358 for the home office number and 303-440-4512 for the shop. Well
our new space has an office and therefore we are trimming down the numbers
to one line. The new shop (only) number is 303-579-0312. This number will
have a person on the other end from 9-5 M-F and from 10-2 on Sat. The reason
for the cut back in phone time is so that we can have time to reply to the
many e-mail requests we get each day. I hope this doesn't adversely affect
anyone. So please help spread the word that our number and hours have
changed.

Thank you all for your help.

We want to be the best parts place for 1968-1979 bay window buses. Type2
list subscribers are our best customers and we encourage our customers to
become type2 subscribers. This list has more information than any shop or
parts place could every dream. The real beauty of the internet is knowledge
that is created through its communities. We want to thank the list for all
of its support by offering three dollar shipping on all non oversize
continental US shipments. Mention this add when you place your order or
select type2 for you shipping method during check out and only pay $3.00 for
shipping.
