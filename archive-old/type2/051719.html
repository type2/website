They remill the carriers and install larger ball bearings.  Basically new CV's.

I can't tell the difference between new and rebuilt.  The boots 
usually go before the CV's anyway and they replace the whole unit 
(Your labor).

&gt;
&gt;By the way, have you noticed a lot of sloppiness in
&gt;the joints of rebuilt half shafts?  I wonder how much
&gt;it would cost to get a half shaft with new CVs?  The
&gt;new CVs are so stiff they feel galled compared to a
&gt;well worn CV.
