I noticed more missing parts.  Damn, but the guy who

The shop you're referring to, would that happen to be Bugformance in Sunnyvale?  

Anyway, I've been running into some of the things you're encountering now when you look under your bus, all kinds of missing things.  It's a wonder how some people let things go.  

As for the heater system in your bus, the heat exchangers are attached to the y-pipe by two big accordion-looking plastic pipes, which can be somewhat easily found (Bus Depot, Bus Boys, etc.)  As for the flaps that close off air flow into the y-pipe, I've heard they can rust shut or open, depending on their position when the cables break.
