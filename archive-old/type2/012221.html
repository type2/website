Hey there Volks,

I remember someone posting something about &quot;free camping&quot; books.

I went to the archives ( http://vw.i405_dot_com ) and found this:

Nikki wrote:
I've got Don Wright's book &quot;Guide to Free Campgrounds&quot; that lists
free
camping spots by state, and lists any restrictions as re: parking in
rest areas. He also does a series called &quot;Camping on a Shoestring&quot; by
region. You can get his books in any RV supply store or on-line.

Hope this helps,
