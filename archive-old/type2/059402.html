&gt;&gt;&gt;do you seriously drive like that?

Umm, no. I usually rev mine to 3500rpm before changing, given a clear road ahead. In fact,
the 'Type 4' engine seems better suited to early change-ups, as it wheezes and struggles
above about 4500rpm (at least, mine does). But with the relatively low 5400rpm limit and
the fact that the limiter is there, you will not cause any damage by occasionally revving
to the maximum, and I just suggested it as a way of finding your speedometer reading at
these points through the gears.
