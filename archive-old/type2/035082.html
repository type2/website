&gt; Even though there are people on the list who have picked up a bus for 
&gt; under $1000 and never done a thing to it, that's just luck.

That is me, sort of. I don't want to start a &quot;how much do you have in your
bus&quot; thread, but i picked it up running (term used loosely) for 500, and i'll
have a bout 1500 in it with rebuilt engine, brakes, cvs, ball joints, etc.
She ain't pretty, but she's mine and i know whats in the engine 'cause i (will
have - when i finish) put the SOB back together!

I have a beater 83 toyota 4wd wagon that i'd drive just about anywhere.  Got
about a grand in that one as well.

Partsbus, partsbus, partsbus!!! Do-the-work, do-the-work, do-the-work!!!!
