Subject: [T2] engine code and birth certificate

Hey List I used to know a site where you could send in your engine code
number and the chassie number and VW or someone would be able to send you a
birth cert of your Bus telling you all the history. Heres my numbers but I
cant sem to find out if its the original engine, any one have a clue? I
looked at the archives but I got 1,024 hits and a lot of Mcode stuff. Anyone
out there help?

Todd Oklahoma City
1974 Westy engine code # AW007275
Chassie # 2342068322
