Subject: Tank Out with Engine In?
Message-ID: &lt;373BC344.FCB2C3E8_at_west_dot_net&gt;

I just bough a '74 Campmobile &amp; the fuel guage isn't working--I'm
assuming it's the sender. Seems like I might as well go all the way and
replace the filler neck, clean the tank and replace all the hoses while
I'm at it. If nothing else, it will be a good way to get acquainted with
the machine.

Reading  through the archives, I'm not sure if you can remove the fuel
tank with the engine in or not. Seems like a couple of guys have done
it...sounds sort of like a breach birth &amp; I'd like some pointers if
you've got 'em.
