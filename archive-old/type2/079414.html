www.gowesty_dot_com - they've got many kinds, but pretty pricy.

There are also some improved door locks you can get.

Subject: [T2] Need suggestions on a Full Bus Cover

Hello,

I've been off the list for a while now, but maybe someone can give me
some
suggestions for a bus cover.  Last week my bus was broken into.  Luckily
they only got the cd player, but they tore up the dashboard and glove
box in
the process.  Now I'm looking for a bus cover to help with security and
for
weather (my bus is no longer my main vehicle and sits in the sun most of
the
week).  Can anyone suggest a good place to find a full bus cover for a
'71
Passenger bus?  Is there a certain kind that is better than another?
It's a
shame I have to resort to covering up her pretty paint job.  If you have
any
suggestions, please let me know.
Thanks,
Dallas

P.S.  There is a bus near Duke University that has a nice cover on it,
the
bus is a greenish-purple metalic colored passenger.  Is that person on
the
list or does anyone know who it belongs to?
