Subject: Re: tightening rims/ wheels coming off

When my SO changed a front flat by herself in our 60's bug, she also
likely didn't tighten (center) the lugs in their recesses; she called me
about a terrible vibration in the front end...I said check the nuts, and
yes they were loose!  I've since learned to use a longer wrench (a
sliding handle) and to tighten in the sequence that follows one drawing
a star, or going clockwise, to the 2nd lug,  This is done in 2 stages,
one just to get the nut seated in its recess, and finally to really sock
it down.

&gt; well torque to spec, but one thing that does need to be done is to make
&gt; sure the wheel is seated fully, I have seen many that the wheel nut is not
&gt; fully down into the recess and it is hung up on a slight imperfection in
&gt; the wheel, so after a while the imperfection lets go and the lug nut gets
&gt; loose...
