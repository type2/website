    While looking in some catalogs for after-market rims, I found a nice
little chart showing rim sizes, hub holes size, etc. for all cars and
trucks. The best fit for buses are Mercedes. These years are a good fit,
with both bolt pattern and hub hole size being correct, but it said
nothing about offset, although someone else here has testified as to
offset being right, I believe:

190,220,260,280,300, &amp; C-Class  	'84-'98		15x7
420,560SEL,580SEL			'86-'91		15x7
E-Class					'93-'98		15x6.5

  These charts also said that the 225 tire should have a 7&quot; rim,
although a 6.5 would do, and that a 205 was best with a 6.5&quot;, but a 7&quot;
would do also. Seems like I recall long ago reading somewhere that a
wider rim (that is, wider than what was required for a given tire size)
actually gives better sidewall support. Narrower, like trying to run
205's on a stock VW 5.5&quot; rim gives bad sidewall support. 
   Also, looking in this book, it was clear that non of the BMW rims
will work, nor the Jeep Cherokee that I was looking at yesterday.
