&gt; Good advice. The cable that came with my Bus had 3 washers on the end
&gt; because of stretch (I assumed).  I bought a new one and it had the exact
&gt; same problem - too long. So I still have 3 washers at the end of my cable.
&gt; Don't recall its length I assumed If I ordered  a cable for a 1978 Bus it
&gt; would fit (RMMW). Does anyone know what length cable I should have for
a1978
&gt; Bus?

You should have cable # 211 721 335J
And don't put washers on the cable end. Put them on the Bowden tube where
the end goes thru the support.
