Subject: Re: [T2] Short range FM transmitters (&amp; movies for the kids)

Hi Mike,

Our campsite is located about a half-mile from the nearest home, so I  
don't have much worry about interfering with anyone's home radio  
reception. The campground area we have available is actually pretty  
big... Pretty close to the size of the area where EveryBus is held,  
maybe bigger. If we put a had a couple of large radios tuned to the  
same station we could create our own wireless PA system, that might  
be used with a laptop-based playlist at other times.

Of course, it's impossible to provide one music channel to make  
everyone happy. And I'd rather not  have everyone unhappy about the  
music except the one person running it. But with such a big area to  
work with a PA system would come in handy; esp. for the driving  
challenge event.

I am looking into creating a BOTC Drive-in, but haven't yet been able  
to nail down a projector. If someone has one and is planning on  
coming up to BOTC I will gladly refund their camping fees if they  
will commit to bringing it along. We will use my 10'x15'-sided white- 
sky shelter as the projector screen.  Screening a movie like  
&quot;Festival Express&quot; for the adults would be pretty cool and it would  
have the required Canadian Content as well.

....Now I gotta get back to the driveway to wrestle with an Auto  
tranny swap on my wife's bus.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; The FM transmitters have a poor range; I returned one, as it worked  
&gt; only a few feet from the radio.  Better to use a radio with an AUX  
&gt; input and use an adaptor to feed the LINE out from a DVD or CD  
&gt; player to the phono plug inputs.  For a PA, consider a PC mic, and  
&gt; feeding the headphone output to the same radio AUX inputs.
&gt;      At Westies in the Woods they had a digital projector on an 8  
&gt; ft sheet feeding from a 12v inverter playing the Futurama episode  
&gt; with the VW bus and a movie-(Herbie?) - the kids watched even when  
&gt; it rained (projector was in the tent)!
