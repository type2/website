&gt; Uh... poop.  Now I know why Previous Owners are the target of such ridicule.  I
&gt; probably need a new transmission, then?  That's like the cost of just buying a bus
&gt; that works in the first place, right?

No!  I was meaning that if you could start the engine, and run it, then
the tranny is the problem.

Sounds like your clutch is either frozen, or the cable is gone.

Replace the cable.:)

Chances are your bowden tube is fine, but since you have a new one,
replace it too.:)  the other piece I dont think I've ever seen.:)  Just
replace the cable, and adjust.

Then see how it works.  You want ~1/2 an inch of free play in the pedal.
(movement at the pedal, before you feel the clutch begin to work...)

later...david
