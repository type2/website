Subject: Re: VDO short/MOFOCO

&gt;Hi all, I've attempted to install a VDO oil temp gauge that I 
&gt;pulled at a junkyard, but when I connect the lead and ground, 
&gt;the guage maxes out, and this is unaffected when I connect the 
&gt;sender...I assume this is a short?  

Did you pull the sender from the same car as well?  What kind of car did it 
come out of?  The sender must be grounded to your bus in order to test the 
gauge.  Have you already installed the sender or at least make sure it was 
securely grounded when you were testing?
