Subject: Re: [T2] Re: List Help, and GL4 Trans Lube

contrary to common belief._dot_castrol does make a gl4,  the make two hypoid 
oils. hypoid and hypoid c.
the hypoid c is gl5 and the plain hypoid is gl4.  the problem is that it 
gets mixed up on flaps shelves if they stock both. or like at the place 
i work a sales person stated that they all are gl5 without even looking.

&gt; I wish to thank the list for the extremely valuable help with several
&gt; upgrades I've been doing on my 70 bus. Advice I saved from Stevo was 
&gt; very
&gt; helpful, I just replaced the outer front door window scraper with an
&gt; extremely high quality VW brand scraper from Ron at Bus Depot. I also
&gt; replaced the Bus front door lock spring with help from the article from 
&gt; Ron
&gt; Van Ness. I would not have ever attempted either job without list 
&gt; advice.
&gt; Re GL4 trans lube- This is very hard to find. I looked everywhere, 
&gt; finally
&gt; found some at Canadian Tire- it is MotoMaster TDH Fluid-which is GL4. I 
&gt; will
&gt; be installing it in my bus and trike. Thanks to Dr. Tim.
