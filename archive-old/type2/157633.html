No, you just need 2 new pieces of plastic.

If I was home, I could give you the VW part number for
them. I have a couple of good used pairs of them....

 On the way home from our company xmas party last
 night the stalk just
 went limp. It flops around now and does nothing.
 So I'd like a visual
 of what I'm getting into before I take things
 apart.
 
 I finally got to pull the steering wheel off today.
 It came off super
 easy once I got the nut off. No banging required.

 This is what it looked like when I pulled the
 steering wheel off. Yep,
 that clip thing was just setting there.

 You can sort of see the broken pot metal in that
 shot.
 
 Definitely broken. :( I covered the shaft and
 threads with grease so
 it'll come apart even easier when I get the $$ for a
 turnsignal.
 Bentley's directions for pulling it apart weren't
 all that great.
 &quot;Disconnect. Unscrew. Lift.&quot; Gee, thanks. Heh.
