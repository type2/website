Subject: Re: [T2] Stuck Lugs on the left rear of a 72

Before I cut or got a grinder, I would find a mobile truck tire repair truck
for those big semi's and have him come over and impact them babies off......


&gt; Ok I have soaked em down with every known penetrating oil I can find, I have
&gt; taken an electric impact and an air ratchet to them, I have bent 2 tire
&gt; Irons, my next course of action seems to be grinding the buggers off or
&gt; cutting them off, any other suggestions would be VERY helpful.
