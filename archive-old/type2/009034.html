Subject: Is this a real VW swamp cooler?
Message-ID: &lt;19990423173000.5535.rocketmail_at_send205.yahoomail_dot_com&gt;

All,

I have a guy who wants to trade me a window-mount
swamp cooler for my Dual Kadrons, but he doesn't know
if it's an origional VW option or not. He sent me a
pretty clear photo of it, but I've never seen a *real*
one in person and can't tell either.

Here'r the facts as I know them..
1- It's black.
2- It mounts to the rain gutter outside an open
window.
3- It is roughly tear-drop shaped (when viewed from
the front or rear), with a large flat spot facing into
the cab.
4- It works.
5- From the photo, it appears to be in very good
condition.

If this is a &quot;real&quot; unit, what is the ballpark value
of it? In all the funky stuff I've seen for VW's, I've
never seen one of these in real-life, so I assume they
are reasonably rare. (?)

I would appreciate any help that you can offer and if
needed, I will forward the photo I have for better
identification.


Thanks.


Jaime
