Hello,

We took Ruby down to Santa Cruz and over into Big Basin National Forest this 
weekend as sort of a Christmas getaway. I was a little concerned if I would 
get there and back without trouble but we did.

Right now I need to get all of the linkage adjusted, the acc cable pulled 
out the other day and I think when I have it floored right now its about 
where it was when I had it pressed halfway in the past. Hopefully that wont 
be too $$$ of a job.

Anyway, the bus ran really well and I got about 17 miles to the gallon.

It was beautiful in the woods saturday night, but did get a little chilly. 
This is where having all of your seals perfect comes in handy I think. Once 
we were in there for about 30 minutes or so it was pretty comfortable. I ran 
the aux battery all night long with a light and the bus tape deck and there 
was still plenty of juice in it 11 hours later. I was always wondering how 
much juice I could get out of that would be.

If you would like to see a fes pictures from the trip :

and

This second one you can see the front of the bus pretty well. Any thoughts 
on the possibility of putting a new emblem on here? It has damage from where 
the front mount tire used to be.


Then if your real bored, see the whole album from this trip.
