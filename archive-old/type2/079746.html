Subject: Re: [T2] Does the grim reaper drvie a bus

GEEZ!!!! i think you should not let your brother near a car ever again!! yikes
that is a bad driving record :-) i'd be in tears seeing someone roll a 30 year
old antique car whatever the make.
peace
jamie

&gt; I have had five busses over the years.
&gt; I always thought that if I got hit that was it.  But my brother crash tested
&gt; my 71 and my 72.
&gt;
&gt; The 71 he rolled on it side then three weeks later they flipped three times
&gt; on the freeway.  They drove it away both times.
