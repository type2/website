Subject: Re: [T2] So...   Which is the...   *right*   carburator for me?

&gt;Heh, heh... Sorry, my sense of humor is suffering at
&gt;this time. Due to unplanned expenses, etc, I can't do
&gt;the FI, like I wanted. There is no way I am putting up
&gt;with my Weber progressive this winter. Ebay has some
&gt;Weber 40 IDF dual carbs.

Beware of the alfa1750 guy - he sells a lot of Weber and Dellorto carbs but 
they are just bare carbs (no manifolds, linkage, etc.).  I think he must 
get them off of wrecked cars in Europe.  No way to know if they will fit 
properly, not to mention how they are jetted.  Not saying he's defrauding 
anyone, just make sure you know what you are buying.

&gt;Are these the right size for
&gt;my 1700?

IMO they are too big, but they will run.  The 36's would be a better match 
for your 1700 unless you are going to be revving it up to 6k regularly.

&gt;How do dual carbs do in the winter, anyway?

Better than single carbs but they can still ice up.  Here in Dallas, the 
Dellorto DRLAs (which are almost identical to the Weber IDFs) ice a little 
bit for a few weeks out of the year, but it's not severe enough to kill the 
motor and generally not too annoying.
