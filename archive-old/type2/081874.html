Subject: [T2] Lights go dim


&gt; My bus is running pretty strong after the newly installed engine,
&gt;
&gt; but now the alt light comes on dimly when idling/driving and lights go dim
&gt; and then bright and my stereo (connected directly to the battery) flickers
&gt; and even goes off. It doesn't seem to matter whether I gun the engine,
etc.
&gt;
&gt; I replaced the voltage regulator and coil. The alternator is a new Bosch
&gt; rebuilt (from a FLAPS) put on with the engine swap and the belt is tight.
&gt; The battery is a real nice Optima red top and is only a few months old.
&gt;
&gt; Any ideas what to look for or what could be causing this. I haven't added
&gt; anything electrical recently. I don't have a volt meter or anything except
a
&gt; test light.
&gt;
&gt; Also how unsafe is it for me to drive the bus like this? Its my only
&gt; transportation, and at the least I would need to go get any new parts in
it.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!!
