Subject: Re: [T2] Help(Oil filters)

Tyler,

A leak in the area you mention could be the oil filter, but it could also
be some other things.  My first candidate is the oil pressure sender.
Second is the oil cooler and its seals. Check the filter for tightness and
seal, then look at the oil pressure sender.  If both of those are good,
then check the oil cooler seals or oil cooler.
