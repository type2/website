Subject: [T2] Assateague campout info

Volks:

Hey, can somebody email me the details about the
campout this weekend?  I remember reading the original
posts way back when and reserved a campsite but
deleted the posts.  I imagine it won't be to hard to
find the other campers when I get there but if there
is a list of scheduled events or something I'd like to
know about it.

If not well I'll be there anyway sometime Friday. 
It'll be me, my girlfriend, our 2 dogs and our 78
Champagne Deluxe Westy.  Although if busses were
champagne ours would be Andre.

If you're going, see you there!

Bob J.

p.s. When I made the campsite reservation under the
additional message section it says &quot;Fires are allowed
on beach.  Be prepared for extreme conditions of
mosquitos and other biting insects.&quot;  Oh joy, make
sure you bring Off, not On.
