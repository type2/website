Not yet anyway...Split window busses are enjoying a surge in value,
due to any number of reasons...Cheap to restore, compared to 
other 'classic' cars and a cachet fostered by the appearance in
quite a few TV shows and ads...The Columbo Yogurt ad comes to
mind as does That 70's Show...A collector magazine from Aus-
tralia cited the split window as a good choice for investors...
