Now when it comes to perfect there aren't many out there, so by no means will 
i say this is any exception.  but for a good starter read on, especially Cali 
cause no smog.
1973 Westfalia Pop-Top
color- orange
pop top canvas needs repair, was good until major high winds took their toll
1.7 motor, sticker says rebuilt in Canada,
automatic transmission, rebuilt and serviced stateside
90% of original interior to include child's cot, just a bit dirty
running, clean title, California, last plated in 98
bumpers and exterior lighting fair, need a couple lenses on side,
winshield, small cracks out of view, all rest of the glass is good
a/c mounted in jumpseat behind driver, pump removed, all parts present
two extra parts buses, one pop top, one not, use to complete or take with
lowback seats interior there but dirty, sand etc..
brakes reworked and excellent condition
NEEDS
One front tire (flat, shot no good)
one spare (flat, shot no good)
running light and reflector lens on side
TLC BATH AND WAXING
New driver (you???)
Now this is where my heart starting racing real fast!!  **ALL THIS FOR JUST 
$700.00**
Now i met this gentlemen today yard shopping (not yard sales) v-dub planters, 
and was welcomed in for a tour.  The Primary Westy is in good shape and if I 
was staying you all wouldn't be getting this info, lol.  But he made it 
perfectly clear he would much rather me buy it and resell it, then to turn 
his house in to a public sightseeing tour.  So I once more take it upon 
myself to share it with you all and let you decide.  I liked it and think 
that with a few hours it would make any length trip and it was prepared to do 
such a trip but family matters mad it impossible for him to complete and has 
been sitting since the original trip preparations were done.  You decide and 
feel free to call me for the nitty-gritty.
Peace Out
Rick
Mojave for the moment
