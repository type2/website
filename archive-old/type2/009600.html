Subject: Web-page *finally* up/need bus-related links/URL's!!!
Message-ID: &lt;19990528184034.19845.rocketmail_at_web117.yahoomail_dot_com&gt;

All,

Well, it had to happen sooner or later: my '69 westy
web-page is *finally* up and running. It's still
pretty small and some of the internal links are not
running yet (I haven't written the pages yet!), but
the first iteration is there. I will be completely
revamping over the next few weeks, but if you want to
visit, it's at:
www.futureone_dot_com/~jcnkb2 (sorry, Yahoo! doesn't have
clickable links in their e-mail, but you can simply
enter the URL in your browser window and hit &quot;enter&quot;
and it will take you there). My server is kind of
slow, so please be patient and let the entire page
load &lt;I will be making changes to speed it up soon&gt;,
it'll be worth it.

So...here's what I need from you folks... LINKS! I'm
going to create a seperate HTML document called
&quot;BusLinks&quot; with links to other bus-related sites that
I will then post on my site and offer free of charge
to anyone else as well.

I do not care what the content is, as long as it's
bus-related (maybe some other air-cooled sites too;
I'll decide when I see them). Some of the categories
I'd like to fill are:
~vintage bus sites (1949-1968)
~loaf sites (1969-1979)
~air cooled vanagon sites 
~commercial vendors/mechanics
~Tech sites
~Individual owners sites
~Club sites
~whatever else I'm missing

As I said, I will collect these URL's and together
with a brief description of these sites, create an
HTML document called &quot;BusLinks&quot; that I will update
regularly. I will offer it to anyone who wishes to
post it on their web-site and I will e-mail an
attachment of each update as they occur. Because there
will be no photos, this document will *not* take much
memory from your web-site (no more than a few K, I
should think). I will also include my e-mail adress so
visitors can offer other links.


I REALLY want to make this happen (it will be a pretty
good source of referrence when done), but I NEED YOUR
HELP GETTING THE URL'S!!!! PLEASE!


Thanks!


Jaime
