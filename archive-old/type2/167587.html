&gt; I assume you mean the brand MSD.

yes
&gt;
&gt; If so, I had the same thing happen to me with an almost brand new MSD
&gt; Blaster II coil, it failed after a very short use. The reason was a constant
&gt; undervoltage from a bad alternator and being mounted at an angle.
&gt;
&gt; You have to get the &quot;high vibration&quot; unit Part Number 8222 with a 0.8ohm

that is the one I have.

&gt; ballast resistor. They only offer the resistor with the Blaster 2 coil PN
&gt; 8203, so you can go down to your FLAPS and get one instead.

while I had a resistor I only used it when I put the points back in.

&gt;
&gt; FYI to everybody, using a MSD Blaster style coil or some newer Bosch Blue
&gt; coils without a resistor burns up pretty much everything except a crane and
&gt; Compufire. The Pertronix is at risk and HotSpark and stock points simply
&gt; melt or burn up.

I have the Crane 3000 that uses the higher output

&gt; Thrilled to hear you are back on the road! I have been pondering your
&gt; situation the since it came up.


what little hair that I had that wasn't already white or gone is joining
the previously departed.

as I said it would be a 5-50 project,  50 hours to find, 5 minutes to fix.

it always is much harder when it isn't just one problem at a time, bad
coil AND points that were intermittently shorting to ground.

thanks for all the help
