Subject: Fw: [T2] Shocks

Thanks, Karl.  Right on target.

I finished the job, and the difference is AMAZING.  And this from
a gas-to-oil shock.  Wow,
they must have been REALLY bad.

Again, thanks.  Can't wait to do the fronts, too!

&gt; &gt; Yes, this is normal for a single-action oil shock. They only
&gt; dampen spring
&gt; &gt; travel on the down stroke.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Double-action shocks dampen travel in both directions. But I
&gt; don't know of any
&gt; &gt; being made.....

&gt; &gt; &gt; Are the NAPA shocks bad?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; No, they work as designed. If they were bad, they would not
&gt; extend.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Are my BOGE replacement shocks bad?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; No, they work as designed.
