Subject: first NOS score!/rust questions

List,

I'm feeling especially volks-dorky today with my NOS driver side rear vent window scored for &lt;20 bucks!

In the old blue box with german all over it and everything.

I'm sure many of you have been there before, but it's pretty cool to have brand new obscure parts.

Now to find the seal for less than 50 bucks!

I have tons of rust at the bottom of the old window's pivot point to where I can pull the vent window out without removing anything.

What are my options, anybody done this repair?

Billy
