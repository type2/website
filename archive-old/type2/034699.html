Subject: early bus sheet metal parts

I'm in need of some metal framing parts for the '65 bus I just acquired. 
Both the front and rear outriggers are pretty well lost to rust &amp; I'd like
to start the restoration from there.  Cal Imports only had 1 front outrigger
in stock and doesn't expect to get a new shippment for several months.   
I've already inquired at Bus Depot and Schofield in England and am anxiously
waiting reply.  Anybody sitting around with these, or know of an alternate
source?  Any help would be appreciated!!
