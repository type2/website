HF (Hydrofluoric acid) has to be the top of the list of nasty acids.  This
stuff eats _glass_!  It is normally kept in polyethyline bottles or
wax-coated glass bottles.

Get a significant quantity of HF on your skin and it migrates to
the bones where it deteriorates them in a very painful way.  The cure is
amputation of the affected body part.

Yes, HF is good at rust removal because it is the most active acid.
However, considering the dangers, the other acids are not that much worse.

I won't even keep the stuff in my school storeroom because of its nasty
qualities.

I'm amazed that craft stores sell HF in a gel form for glass etching
without any extraordinary warnings.

Be careful out there Junior Chemists!
