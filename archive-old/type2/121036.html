Subject: Re: [T2] when does the spark plug fire?

Yes, I like that version.  I will use that when I actually get to 
installing the distributor.  I still have to mount that cooling fan 
housing so I can install the cooling fan and then put the timing markers 
on.  However, somehow I keep managing to find more parts to paint so it 
keeps getting delayed ;)

I am almost done with this engine rebuild!  And what, it's only been, 
hmmm... 2.5 years.. doh!

hahaha,

&gt; I agree (metoo! metoo!) except that I would state it this way: #1 will be
&gt; at TDC 180 degrees of clockwise rotation after the intake valve for #1 has
&gt; closed.  The intake and exhaust valves will both be closed when the engine
&gt; is 360 degrees out of its proper firing point (at the end of the exhaust
&gt; stroke) as well, but the car will not fire there. Unless you are Superman
&gt; or otherwise possessed of X-ray vision the only way to determine when a
&gt; long-block or other unknown engine is at TDC for #1 is to remove the
&gt; right-hand valve cover and rotate the engine until you see the #1 intake
&gt; valve close.  Once you have seen that valve close then rotate the engine
&gt; another 180 degrees and you will be close to TDC for #1.
