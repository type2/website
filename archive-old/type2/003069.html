The title is &quot; How tTo Keep Your Volkswagen Alive A Manual Of Step By Step
Procedures For The Compleat Idiot.&quot; It was written by John Muir.  It is
still available.  I expect this will be the 3,976th reply to the message you
posted.

Subject: [T2] need a good VW repair manual


&gt; I bought a '68 camper about a year ago but have not had much tiime to
spend
&gt; on it because I go to school and work. It's been giving me a lot of
problems
&gt; and I really want to learn how to fix it myself. A friend told me a good
&gt; book to get is &quot;The Complete Idiot's Guide to VW Repair&quot; or some similar
&gt; phrasing. Unfortunately this book is out of print and I haven't been able
to
&gt; find a used book. I have a general book about my VW but it is difficult to
&gt; read and understand. I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions. I need
&gt; something with good pictures and step-by-step instructions. I don't know
&gt; much about VW's but would really like to learn.
