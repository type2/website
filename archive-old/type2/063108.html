Subject: RE: Help w/friend's '74 (misfiring?)

Some more information on this one.  I went out at lunch and reset the dwell -
got that one wrong and nobody flamed me, I needed to open the gap up to decrease
the dwell.  Anyway, with the new, improved dwell at 48 degrees, the RPM's came
up into spec and the timing changed to right on 10 ATDC.  Now after the quick
and dirty tuneup, it still backfires occasionally, so I poke around a little
more.  I disconnect the fuel shutoff valve power on the left carb and the engine
dies, when I do the same on the right carb, it only slows from 900 RPM to 800
RPM.  Then I manually turn the engine with a wrench on the alternator pulley nut
while observing the crankshaft position.   It gets progressively harder to turn
as each piston approaches TDC on its compression stroke, just as expected,
except #2, which exhibits only slight resistance.

My new conclusions are that there is low compresion in #2 due either to wear or
bad valve adjustment and the idle mixture on the right carb has been adjusted
with this poor performing right bank, resulting a very rich idle mixture, which
in turn allows the engine to run even though the shutoff valve is de-energized.

No I didn't do a compression check nor inspect the valves, as I was in my day
job clothes and didn't want to get real dirty.

Any comments?
TIA,
terry
