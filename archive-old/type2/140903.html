Subject: Re: [T2] distributor application

Gary asked:

I have in my hand right now, except when I am typing, a distributor
that is not listed on that page.

It is true that people regularly install the incorrect distributors.

I took this distributor off a 1700 cc (or 1800) Fuel Injected engine of
unknown origin. A friend bought a house and the engine was in the barn.

I swear on Porsche's grave that these are the correct numbers and correct
description from this distributor:

 dual vacuum advance/retard ported vacuum tank
internal centrifugal advance mechanism

has fuel injection electrical data link three pronged port labeled 21 12 22

 top number is Bosch  0 231 172 007
bottom number is VW    022 905 205E

So what does this distributor really fit?

Don't look out the front window..... there is a guy out there in a white uniform with a butterfly net.......

Seriously though, you are not going off the deep end.

The 3 wire connecter tells you it is for a D-Jetronic fuel injected engine.
The only 2 cars, that I know of, that used the type 4 engine and D-Jet were the 914 and the 411.

Your 022 905 205 E dizzy came from a 411 with 1.7 engine.
I do not know the model numbers that these engines fit, which used the E dizzy:

W007334 to W057034  022
W057035 to W129581  M553/022:2
EA000001 to EA039464 M553/022

M553 should be USA specs.

The engine numbers appear to be 1970 yr model for the 022.
Aug 1 1970 to July 31 71 for the M553/022:2.
And Aug 1 71 thru early 72 for the M553/022

The engine number range came from here: http://www.tunacan_dot_net/t4corner/reference/production.shtml
BUT I believe he has added an EXTRA 0 on all the engine numbers he lists.
For 1970, for 1.7 liter 59 kW (80 bhp), he lists W 0 000 001 to W 0 057 034.  None of the VW parts lists shows
that single zero after the letter.
It is laid out as W 000 001 --&gt; W 057 034
