Subject: Re: [T2] Woe is me.

While I can't directly comment on how hard/PITA working on a dual carb
setup is. You don't want to force this issue. I would get any specific
opinions about your bus from the mech (sounds like you have already)
and keep those at the back of your mind. Making a mech work on
something he either doesn't feel comfortable with or doesn't like will
only give you greif. I can see 2 months down the road him simply
saying &quot;well I said you would have this problem, but you insisted&quot;.
Start looking around for another mech or buy the muir &amp; work it
yourself.

&gt; So I am happily shopping for stuff at my favorite local dealer today. I
&gt; picked up some door handles and other broken stuff for my new baby.  When
&gt; the shop owner informs me that his mechanic refuses to work on my particular
&gt; year of westy.  And he proceeded to list the following &quot;known&quot; problems:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Throttle linkage wears out and creates a vaccuum leak on the dual carbs.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. The engine is hard to access and therefore work on.
&gt; 
&gt; His main bone of contention seemed to be the carb situation. He seems to
&gt; dislike the dual carbs with a passion. Maybe they stomped on his flower bed
&gt; in a previous life. But anyway, I am a little disheartened, how big of a
&gt; deal is this? Opinions ideas? :-(
&gt; 
&gt; Question #2, exhaust leak near the head on the driver's side. It doesn?t
&gt; look like its the head itself so I suspect the heat exchanger is cracked.
&gt; The question is, can this be done engine in the bus or do I need to yank it.
&gt; 
&gt; And an update:
&gt; 
&gt; To those whose had suggestions for the shifter and no reverse, thank you!
&gt; The shifter plate was out of adjustment and now everything is hunky-dory.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.
