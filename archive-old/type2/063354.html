I'm glad there's a cure for this. Conley, a guy I used to work with, 
would warm his 72 for 5 minutes before bringing the RPM above an idle. I 
ask why one day. He had added an external oil cooler and filter to his 
van years earlier. One cool morning, shortly after adding the filter, he 
backed out of the garage, as normal, and noticed a small &quot;whiff&quot; of 
smoke from the back. On investigation, the seal on the filter was 
leaking in a small &quot;squirt&quot; onto the exhaust... and the Fram filter was 
now shaped like a globe.

The Bosch has a bypass valve, doesn't it?
