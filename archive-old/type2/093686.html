Subject: RE: [T2] re:stripped sparkplug hole??


Im using JB WELD in my exhaust manifold studs, i stripped one studs , used
JB Weld in it and its solid as rocks!


Objet : Re: [T2] re:stripped sparkplug hole??


Since it's basically a throw-away head you could always try &quot;ye olde
JB Weld&quot;. When prepared properly this stuff works wonders &amp; who cares
if you can't take the plug back out w/out damaging the head. Worth a
shot, especially if keeping the head doesn't matter. I have had good
results w/ jb weld, but you HAVE to make sure the surfaces are clean.
