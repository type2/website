Two summers ago, we were delayed by about 10 hours from our scheduled departure
time for a caravan to mexico.  A 3,500 mile round trip.  The delay was due to me
finishing up the preparation of the $500 74 Westy with a blown engine.  I had
done the engine, bearings, brakes, CV joints, electrical fixes, basically a
complete overhaul begun two months prior to our planned trip.  The initial test
drive and break in was when we loaded up and headed out.  Changed the oil and
checked the valves at the first stop, and often during the trip.  Other than a
broken fan belt, the trip was uneventful.  We were more than 1,000 miles into
mainland Mexico.  My buddy's bus lost a regulater and a clutch cable.  We had
spares, and enjoyed the adventure.

So, You know the condition of your bus better than any of us.  You need to decide
if you are comfortible with it's condition, and , or, any work you've done to
it.  Take the AIRS list.

Have a fun trip,

Mike D.
