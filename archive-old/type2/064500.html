Subject: RE:Fixing Muffler Holes

Adam, I've had no trouble now for about 6 months from a muffler patch. 
Now, this is the cheap and ugly way for repairing holes.  My muffler hole
is the apparently typical # inch hole that is formed when the EGR
connection to the muffler finally breaks away on the FI vans.  The key for
me was to wrap the hole area with lots of copper wire first - then apply
that muffler repair putty that you can get at any flaps.  Good Luck.
