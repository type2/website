&gt;decent tool kit. Not just automotive, but some general stuff too. Hammer,
&gt;length of eletric cord, trouble light, small bush saw, folding shovel, spare
&gt;jack, stuff like that. And spares..

I don't have much to add to this but there was one tool that was bought
somewhere in Colorado on a whim and truned very useful on our two major
extended tours (not either of them in a bus but WTF), it is amazingly
adept: framing hatchet. Not a roofing hatchet, which has a small smooth
hammer face and a little tomahawk blade meant for splitting cedar shakes. A
decent framing hatchet is designed for post &amp; beam framing, has a big
serrated hammer face the size of a silver dollar, and a good big honking
hatchet face on the back. Heavy, but it's worth it in camp. 8) Softish
steel dulls quick, sharpens quick with a file and won't shatter like a
cutting hatchet will (you ever try to use a cutting hatchet as a chisel?
Don't!).
