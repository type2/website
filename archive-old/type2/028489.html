Hi Rick,

Don't get me wrong. I love the type 4 engines.  When they switched to FI
that was the best and ultimate in VW A/C tech.  Great torque and
reliability...and an oil filter.  I'll let you pull the trailers...no towing
allowed with my Bus.  I might not do too bad though 'cause I'm using a 78
rebuilt tranny with later gearing.._dot_mileage in mind.

Ok...the race is on...what's your unladen weight...I'll add some warm beer
to my rig ;-)

That would be a good race if both vehicles had the same weight and tranny
gearing.  I sure do wish VW wouldn't have gone to such a high 3rd and 4th
gears in the later bays.  Thats why I am putting a '73 tranny in my '76
westy, maybe it'll be closer then!!

But I'd still like to see if your 1776 could pull a trailer or another bus
up and down some of the mountain passes we took this summer for as long as
we did, over 5,000 miles and still have a strong running engine.


&gt; I agree completely that putting a type 1 in a late bus is pure folly.
&gt;
&gt; I also agree that a *stock* type 1 is underpowered and won't last as long
as
&gt; a stock type 4 engine.
&gt; Now my very un-stock 1776 type 1 in my 71 bus is *real* strong after ~80K
&gt; and I bet I make it to 200K no problem.
&gt;
&gt; I'll race ya Rick ;-)
