Subject: Re: [T2] What's the deal with all the cheap busses FS recently?

So true, I'm across the river from the 71(?) Fort Myers FL bus, but no
garage and short of $$$. I don't want to be one in a long line of  probable
previous owners that never got to enjoy it. ( In this case I take it her/his
moving to NC and having the bus apart it just wasn't worth grief of
transporting it up there.)

You gotta wonder how many previous (st)owners have been bankrupted and
defeated by buses their now selling for $200-500 firm...

Anyone else have an assembled running camper bus of some sort in reasonable
condition in SW Florida for a fair price? Seems like the affordable / usable
/ maintainable ones are always CA / OR /  WA etc.!

Down here it's either brand new looking and $$$$$$ or $$$ and in pieces...

&gt; There's no such thing as a cheap bus. All buses end up costing about
&gt; $4000 by the end of a year's time unless (a) you just want a bus in
&gt; your driveway, and don't care about driving it; or (b) you're just the
&gt; luckiest person around.
