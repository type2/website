Subject: [T2] Handling problem

I have a '78 Westy (Lucy) that has defied all of my attempts to teach
her proper handling behavior.  Going straight is fine, crosswinds aren't
any worse than the other non-camper buses I've had.  Turn the wheel, in
either direction, and there is a brief moment of travel appropriate to
the steering wheel's direction, followed immediately by a lurch way
further into the turn.  Up to 45 or 50 mph it's annoying but
controllable.  &gt;50 and you wonder if you'll ever get it back in a
straight line, or back in your lane.  Current stopgap solution is to
deliberately steer half as much as your brain tells you to and wait for
the bus to lurch the rest of the way - works great if you've time to set
up for the turn - scary as hell when you've suddenly got to dodge a
snowbird pulling out of the condo parking lot and the brain doesn't tell
the steering muscles &quot;trust me - just steer half way out of the way&quot;.\
Data:  Cooper SRM II 195R75-14&quot;s, load range D (65psi max) - tried
everything from 35 to 50 on the fronts, 40 to 55 on the rears in every
combination - no appreciable change in above scenario.
       No up and down play in steering mechanism.  New steering box w/
new bushing.  Allignment to specs.  7/8&quot; sway bars F&amp;R.
     I'm completely stumped - can anyone out there offer any advice???
