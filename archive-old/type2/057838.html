&gt;         The bus will see some cold (Michigan) weather operation.  I suspect
&gt; that I don't need the fancier cool-tins, and that warmup will be achieved
&gt; more quickly with the smaller stock deflector plates. 

I'm not exactly sure what the &quot;cool tins&quot; are, but i think you mean the
aftermarket pieces that fit under the cylinders like the ones VW put on
type4 engines? Supposedly they result in a more complete and even
airflow around the cylinders, and since VW used them, they can't be bad.
warmup shoudn't be a problem with the thermostat in place.
