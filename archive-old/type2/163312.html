Subject: Re: [T2] Weird starter solenoid

John -

The solenoid of which you speak of originally did not come with the extra
terminal on the left, as it was introduced on the SR15X starters in 1969 for
the manual transmission Bugs, Type 3s and of course the Type 2.  Later on,
as Fuel Injection was introduced on the Type 1 and Type 2 models in 1975,
the starter solenoid was upgraded by VW &amp; Bosch to accomodate any activation
wires that might have been needed when the starter is activated.  The
0332302040 solenoid (sold as Bosch 31 073) from 1975 onwards had this extra
terminal.  If not needed on your application, just ignore it.

Applications for this solenoid:

VW Bug, K Ghia w/Manual Trans 69-79
VW Type 2 w/Manual Trans 69-82
VW Type 3 w/Manual Trans 69-73

Porsche 914 70-75

&gt; My starter solenoid recently self destructed.After trying to find a
&gt; replacement for several days I have come up empty.The problem...all the
&gt; replacement solenoids have two push on connectors on the right side of the
&gt; solenoid.(if you hold the terminal end of the solenoid facing you,with the
&gt; positive bolt up).Anyway mine has an extra plug on the left side,that gets
&gt; used in my bus.Im not sure what it is.The solenoid is a bosch and appears
&gt; to be stock if not original.Part #0331 302040-540
&gt; Is the signal or voltage coming out of the right side terminal the same as
&gt; whats coming from the left?Do i just combine all the wires and have them
&gt; plug to the terminals on the right side terminals or do I need to find an
&gt; apparently no longer available solenoid?I find it hard to believe that I
&gt; have a unique solenoid but no one seems to have heard of this one.Any
&gt; answers much appreciated.Thanks
