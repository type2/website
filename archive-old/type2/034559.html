Subject: welding and a new website

Hey all..
I put up some more pics of the 63 today... just go to
http://www.luckyboys_dot_com/bus.htm and then the links for them are at the
bottom of the page.  Take a look and let me know what you think!

I started in with the angle grinder today after getting frustrated with
the welding.  Too much gone in some areas..just burnt up the metal.
Anyways... I got most of the bad stuff out on the passengers side cargo
floor/rocker area.  I went at the cargo floor that is.  It is a lot of
work... but will all be worth it in the end....hopefully.

if anyone has any pointers...lemme know.
later
