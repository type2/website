&gt;My father-in-law has a 1974 VW Safari Camper Van and it has a blown motor.
&gt;I am not even sure what motor it has in it.  Could someone tell me?

It will either be a stock 1800 engine or a 1900 engine (1800 with 96mm
cylinders - this is what was on my Safare when I bought it).  Type IV style
pancake engine with dual Solex carbs.  If it's an automatic, it might be
fuel injected, but those are pretty rare in that year.

&gt;Anyways he was talking to a mechanic that supposedly knows VW's and he told
&gt;him to put a 1600 Dual Port engine in it rather than rebuilding the old one.

Ask your mechanic where he plans to come up with the proper tin and engine
mount hardware to make that work.  If he doesn't have a really good answer,
get a new mechanic.  You might want to get a new mechanic regardless of his
answer since he obviously does not have a good understanding of the type IV
pancake engine.

&gt;So my question is what VW's have this motor in it and does anyone know where
&gt;one can be found?

Any motor from 72-74 will bolt up to the bus.  With 75 and up engines you
will have to deal with the fuel-injection vs. carb issue.  With 76 and up
engines you will also need a 76 and up bellhousing and starter to go with
the engine.  With 79 and up engines you will also have the problem of
rectangular exhaust ports vs. oval.  I wouldn't bother with an engine newer
than the 80 model year, as it is just too much trouble unless you really
know what you are doing.

&gt;Also is a 1600 going to have enough power to pull a camper van?

&quot;Enough power&quot; is subjective.  It will have less power than the stock
engine did for sure.

&gt;Any insight would be greatly appreciated as I know nothing about these
&gt;vehicles except that the motor is real easy to take out.

In 72 and later busses I think you will find that the engine is not so easy
to take out, at least not compared to the earlier models.
