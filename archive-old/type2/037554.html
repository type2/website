Subject: Stuck screws

In the many years of owning VW's and working as a Mechanic
I have run into hundreds of stuck screws. There are several
things that you can try. The first is, get a good screw
driver, those new Craftsman are crap. They bend to easy or
just snap off the tip. Old Craftsman are good. Anyway, I
have found that when dealing with two different metals you
get some corosion between the screw and the part. To break
the screw loose, hit it briskly with a hammer. Don't beat
the crap out of it, just a good smack sqarely on the head
will almost always free it up. Second would be to get an
impact screw driver, the kind that you hit with a hammer.
These are available from most tool outlets(Harbor Freight,
Sears,JC Whitney). 
  BTW, on Bugs and Busses with the old style lug bolts, hit
them with the hammer before using the lug wrench, this will
save that 'snap' you get after jumping up and down on them.
I have yet to have one get the better of me.
