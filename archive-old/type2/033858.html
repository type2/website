FOR SURE - my wife had a 74 VW 412, I happened to be driving it when the
cold start valve failed and the FI system caught fire.....in the middle of

  to make a long story short, I had it towed to Tischer VW in Laurel and
it was placed right next to a total cindered identical 412...mine was back

in the engine compartment

keep safe,!
