   The only time that would make any difference is when you were sitting
still and the engine, presumably, was running at an idle, so much less
need for cooling anyway. And, as I said in my other reply to this
thread, I ran a stationary VW engine powering a sawmill for years with
only minimal cooling tin. The sawmill manufacturer designed it that way,
and it worked just fine -- and it wasn't running at an idle either.
