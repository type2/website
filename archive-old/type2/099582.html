..............snip...... it's a good tight fit) it does
not want to go in place without some force. And I do want to use force and
wind up scratching the brand new paint. Any ideas, tricks, tips out there?

Mike....If you have the time (months) let your paint job harden and 
age.  Six months from now it should be considerably more resistant to such 
stress.

The other thing that comes to mind is using a slippery lubricant film to 
facilitate the movement of the part, as it moves across the painted area of 
contact under pressure. I would select things that will wash off with 
water.....such as soap. You will think of some others. I would reserve 
grease as a second choice, and silicone compounds as last resorts, because 
they are progressively difficult to get rid of.
