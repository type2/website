Subject: Heads installed...

Hey all,
Another update on my low compression situation.  You may recall that I 
discovered major cracking in both heads on my '81 Vanagon with 
air-cooled engine.  

I wound up ordering rebuilt heads from AVP, through Bus Depot.  The 
heads were $179 each, with a $50 core charge each, and $30 shipping.  
The total was close to $500, $100 of which will hopefully be speedily 
returned when I send the cores back to AVP.

The heads came sooner than expected.  I was expecting them today or 
tomorrow, but they actually arrived on Friday the 24th.  I went out of 
town for the weekend and after getting back home yesterday, today I got 
into putting the engine back together.

The heads look great, all clean with nice new valves :-)

After witnessing Steve's experience with the exhaust on his AVP heads, I 
decided to trial fit the exhaust to my heads before installing.  I'm 
happy to say that one side immediately dropped into place and the other 
side did the same with a little wiggling.  So it should be pretty easy 
to re-install the exhaust after engine installation.

So today I put the heads on, being careful to follow the proper 
tightening sequence for the head nuts and using a torque wrench.  Got 
them on, then installed the air deflector tin under each set of 
cylinders.  After that I put the pushrod tubes in, with new Viton seals 
from Ron _at_ Bus Depot.  After that, of course, came the pushrods, then 
the rocker arms and the goofy pushrod tube retainer springs.  Once I got 
all that good stuff in, I adjusted the valves, and found only one spongy 
lifter.  Hopefully I have adjusted the valves correctly.  We shall see 
when I try to start the engine :-) -- And I will likely adjust them 
again once I let it run briefly to pump up the spongy lifter.  

After that, I put the valve covers on.  Then it was time to start adding 
tin.  I put on the over-cylinder tin on both sides, the front lower tin, 
the front upper tin, and the tin that goes at the rear of the cylinder 
heads.  Then installed the fan housing, fan, cylinder head temp sensor 
(should have done this before installing the front upper tin!), intake 
manifolds, FI wiring harness (noticed that no labeling is needed, all 
the harness plugs are color-coded -- green = injectors, blue = cold 
start valve, brown = thermo-time switch, black = auxiliary air 
regulator), cleaned up the ground connections for the FI under the air 
distribution box, put on the distributor, vacuum hoses, fuel lines, 
alternator, timing scale and fan grille, EGR pipe, etc etc.

So now the engine sits on the floor completely assembled and ready to 
install.  Not bad for 6 hours' work.  

I'll keep the list posted on how it runs and compression readings.
