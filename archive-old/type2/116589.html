Subject: towing highroof with vanagon?

towing a highroof bus with a vanagon?

Pasadena to Phoenix can be one helluva windy ride.  That would be scary as
hell.  I might do it, but then again I've had a few beers already tonight.

Towing on a 2-wheel dolly?  No way.

I know a guy who bought a mint condition highroof bus and tried to tow it to
NC from Minnesota and they made it only a few hundred miles before it blew
over.  Totaled, although they still have it in the barn.  It still has a
good propane furnace in it, at least.

Do what thou wilt.
