Mike,

It looks like a useful tool for its purpose, finding TDC, but that is
marginal in relation to timing, which is rarely at TDC.  It would also not
work if there were a dropped valve (no compression, no whistle)  The
biggest use I can concieve of for it on a VW is to be sure that the
crank pulley or fan is installed correctly. From there you still need the
static light on a T1 or tioming light on a T4 to correctly set the timing.
