Subject: 68 still agape--devilment!

Thanks to everybody who tried to help with my fried wire. I'm taking the
bus to work in a little while so I'll know soon enough if I hurt anything,
but it seems fine at idle...

I installed new firewall tin on the 68. The firewall tin that was in there
wasn't right, it was the wrong shape. The new tin came all the way from
Massachussetts or however you spell it. It's proper 68 firewall tin, they
said, but since I had a DP I'd have to cut it some to compensate for the
doghouse.

So I carefully shaped it with a hacksaw and it went on fine. But when I
installed the engine, there's still about a 3/4&quot; gap between the firewall
tin and the new front seal.

I'm told that all four years of early bay have slightly different firewall
tin. This is exactly the right shape, but it just isn't far forward enough
to make everything fit right. It's installed right, the tabs that hold the
tin to the case fall in just like they ought to.

Wierdly, there's no hole for the throttle cable to come through in the new
tin. I brought it over the top, which I ended up not liking. I'll have it
out again when I put new heater boxes on later this year and fix that.
It's not a big major problem because it's close enough to patch with some
plumbing insulation, but does anybody know why it's not right?
