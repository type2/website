Jim,

If your distributor is an original one from any vehicle, I usually accept it 
as a given that something is not going to be working to specs on it after 25 
years.

I usually remove the distributor from the bus and:

*check the play in the shaft

*attach tubes to both outlets on the vacuum canister and suck on the tubes to 
see if advance and retard both move the plate that the points are mounted on 

*if the plate appears to be gummed up and dirty I clean it thouroughly and 
may at this point also check the centrifugal advance weights to see if they 
are moving freely.

*Once everything appears to be clean, lubricated and functioning I bench set 
the points or install a pertronix ignitor and reinstall the entire 
distributor with a new seal on the shaft.

You can now, if you have access to a timing light, time it to the specs 
indicated for the distributor and see if both the centrifugal and vacuum 
advance/retard are working to the specs on the table in the type2_dot_com library.

good luck!!,
