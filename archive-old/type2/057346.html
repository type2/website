Subject: 79 california engine for sale.

Sorry, I forgot to put this in the last post

The engine is for sale.  I'm asking $700 + shipping if
necessary, OBO.

It is a 2L 79 california model.  It is stock, and complete,
including the entire exhaust, except the dist.  I have an
009 on it.  I have the stock dist. however, no ICU.  The
engine runs well, idles great and the throttle response is
good.  I have not checked power delivery I have no bus to
put it into. I have no oil pressure gauge, but I wired in
the oil warning light and it doesn't come on. Compression is
even all around, at about 150.

Anyone interested is welcome to come look at it and see it
running on my engine stand.   I live in Maryland. If I can't
sell it whole I'm going to rebuild it and sell the unique
things like the heads, exhaust and dist.

Note.  I will be away from my computer and e-mail from Aug.
21 - Sept. 5 so don't be suprised if I don't get back to you
in that time.

Please respone to me directly.

Thanks
Brent
