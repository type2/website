&gt; 
&gt; but hey, prolly a really good trans and front suspension.! yum

&gt; when you go back, why dont you opy down what is on the mcode plate behind the
&gt; passenger seat and let us know what it says.    :)

I don't think that the axle tube has come away from the frame [but I
must admit that I am not the worlds most efficient lawn mower...though
I must have yanked at least a bail of hay around the bus;)].  The rear
suspension just looks like there is no torsion bar [or the torsion bar
inside the tube has given up] as the swing plates are as far up as
they can go...and there is no weight in the back of the bus...other
than the engine and trannie ;)

The rust is mainly concentrated in the bottom 4-6&quot; of the body
[rockers, lower edge of nose-skin, battery tray --complete with one
scary looking battery], I hope the frame is not too bad.  The skid
plate under the front is sitting in the cab and is in perfect
shape...of course, the stuff that it was suppose to protect might not
be so well off.

When I go back I will take a bottle of mineral spirits to clean the
plate behind the front seat...I couldn't read anything on it this
time.

I don't think I am a masochist, but I would hate to see another old
split meet the crusher...they are so rare here.

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Splits...Oh, my!

Roy
