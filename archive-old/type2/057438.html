&gt; &gt;    Hooey -- the airflow works just fine with them gone. They are
&gt; &gt;desirable if you live in a cold climate and want quicker warm ups in
&gt; &gt;winter, but there is simply no-way whatsoever that the engine is going
&gt; &gt;to overheat with them missing.
&gt; 
&gt; Gotta back up Jazz on this one.  While the cooling air will be blown
&gt; onto the head fins even without the flaps, the air will not be
&gt; distributed evenly and to all the &quot;nooks and crannies&quot; that it would if
&gt; the flaps were in place.  Uneven cooling = head warpage and other weird

    Well, I just had to go look at a fan housing again -- and for the
life of me I can't see where you get that idea. First off, the flap on
the left is mounted on the bottom, and closes upward, whereas the right
flap is mounted at the top, and closes downwards. When both are fully
open, they don't do a cotton-pickin' thing to direct airflow anywhere.
And if they did, it would be very different for each side, which would
promote &quot;uneven cooling = head warpage&quot;, etc.
    What it does look like, however, is that the left flap blocks a lot
of the air going to the oil cooler when it's fully open (down), but I'll
have to wait until tomorrow to stick the other parts together to fully
assess what happens there.
