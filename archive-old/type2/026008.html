&gt;&gt; Want to cause rear bearing failure? Use those socket/Hammer tools. They
&gt;&gt; hammering damages the bearings (we recommend them for EMERGENCY use only,

&gt; Question: are you refering to impact wrenches and the like? what is
&gt; socket/Hammer?

It is a huge piece of steel with a 46mm hex-shaped hole on one end and a
1/2&quot; hole on the other. You stick a breaker bar in the little hole, the
Jesus nut that's holding the back wheel on in the big hole with the breaker
bar off to the left side of this tool, then push down on the breaker bar
with your left hand and hit the tool (right above the breaker bar) with a
sledge hammer until the Jesus nut surrenders.

It's called a Jesus nut because if it comes off while you're driving the bus
down the Interstate, He's the next person you'll see.
