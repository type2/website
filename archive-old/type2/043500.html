&gt; Well, got the engine back in today, started it up and the valves were

&gt; attempt it didn't want to turn over. I pulled the starter out, hooked the
&gt; battery to it directly and the (don't know the correct terms) gear will fly
&gt; out, but the starter won't spin. Does this mean my starter's toast?
&gt; Please advise.

Well, that depends on how you're hooking it up

The solenoid has two places to hook up to. 

If you apply 12V to the spade
connector and ground the starter housing, the gear should pop out and
nothing else should happen.

If you apply 12V to the big stud that the battery cable was attached to
and ground the starter housing, nothing should happen.

If you apply 12V to both the big stud and the spade connector and then
ground the starter housing, the gear should pop out and the motor should
turn.

Finally, if you apply 12V to the fat wire that goes from the solenoid into
the starter proper and then ground the starter housing the motor should
turn without the gear popping out.

If the third test doesn't cause the motor to turn, then the problem is
either bad contacts in the solenoid or bad windings in the starter.  The
fourth test checks the starter windings.
