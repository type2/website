Here's wishing everyone a marvelous summer!  Tomorrow we hit the road for a 4 month road trip.  Look for our '81 Westy (assuan brown) with Montana plates as it treks across the northern states, down the East coast, across the Deep South then thru the Southwest.  Maybe we'll stumble across some VW events on our way.
Happy summer!
