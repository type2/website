Subject: Re: [Re: Type4 vs Type1 (longish)]

I missed some of this thread, but if it helps: I don't have the luxury of a
helper most of the time, and though Ken will gladly come by anytime I ask,
I like to be as independent as possible. For Type1 engines, I can lift them
up on a milk crate with no trouble. I can do it dressed, but it's not easy.

For Type4's, I use 2 milk crates (the old, sturdy, stolen kind--I don't
steal, but someone stole these in the past, I'm sure; I promise, my
possession of them is otherwise legit--my point is that the milk crates you
can buy at office depot won't work; they're too weak).&lt;--will someone check
my punctuation here?;-) Anyway, to get the Type 4 up there, I usually lift
one side at a time and then carefully brace the other side as I lift the
second. It's tricky and there's some risk involved, but so far, it's worked
for me.

Thanks! Joe
