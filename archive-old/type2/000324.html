Subject: holes in exhaust-power loss.....related ?
Message-ID: &lt;000001bec1df$72b6c140$9ac322c3_at_brennanf&gt;

What I know: I have a small hole or two in my exhaust, you can't see them ,
but if you block the tailpipe while she idles, there comes a hissing sound
&gt;from below.
	at speed (60mph), with my foot half depressed on the accelerator, I ascend
a hill. Naturally the power drops off.....I put-foot to get more and....

  this is where I need help:
It sounds as if someone is rattling stones round my exhaust, and I push my
foot THROUGH the power band, but with no increase. This only happens at high
speeds in top gear.

is this: a: power loss through compression loss due to said exhaust holes
( why only 60mph+/4th gear ?)
           b: timing not advancing enough and the firing happening in an
uncompressed cylinder.
I'd appreciate any help.....but am naturally seeking out a new exhaust
system,
any recommendations.
