Subject: Brand New Front Doors - $198

I have the opportunity to buy some brand new genuine Volkswagen/Brazil
front doors at a very cheap price. These normally would sell for about
$350 each, but I could sell them for below wholesale - a bit under $200
each (plus UPS shipping).  This is not much more than many junkyards are
charging for used ones. They are the same as the German ones, and come
bare (no glass, seals, handles, or interior panel). They fit '68 thru
7/76, but a hinge adapter will be available for about $15 per door for
owners of '77-79 busses. It would take about 8 weeks for them to arrive.

Since it's getting very hard to find good used doors in junkyards
anymore, and many of your doors are starting to rust out at the bottom,
this looks like a great one-time chance to replace a rust-prone part
with new at an affordable cost.

I need to gauge how many people would actually buy one or both doors.
This will determine how many I import. Please let me know ASAP, as there
is a time factor. And please be realistic; if you really aren't sure
whether you'd want them, please don't say you would.
