Subject: Re: [T2] hydraulic lifter blowout

&gt;The cam was fine.  pushrods were all straight.  The bottoms of the lifters 
&gt;showed no wear. When the lifters were disassembled a couple showed major wear on 
&gt;the inside.  Was this due to faulty lifters? Had anyone ever had this 
&gt;problem?  He is replacing all the lifters.

The tolerance between the plunger and body of the lifter is the tightest in the entire engine. When the lifter is subjected to dirty oil that scores the inside, the eventual result is destruction which is usually preceeded by excessive lifter noise. When the bus is driven under those conditions the lifters fail as you saw.

&gt;My bus is a daily driver. I drive it a lot.  I always change the oil.  I even 
&gt;use the K&amp;N oil filter.

I don't like their products: they seem to favor performance over filtering.

&gt;The engine is about 4 yrs old.  It is a 2 liter (got 
&gt;it from Boston Engine). No oil leaks.  It's been solid until this.

Mileage?

&gt;The only 
&gt;change I made was switching to Mobil 1 about a year ago.  I don't think that 
&gt;has anything to do with it, but I had to add the info.

What grade are you using? I use 15w50 and I have no problems with hydraulics. 

&gt;How do I prevent 
&gt;something like this from happening again?  Any advice?

It would be best to talk with Boston Bob and get his advice since he built the engine and can do the detective work required to get you an answer. The armchair pundits on this list (myself included) and elsewhere won't be nearly as helpful as talking directly with Bob.
