Subject: Re: [T2] vdo rant

That's odd...

I've got VDO CHT and oil temp gauges in my '77 bus, and they read pretty
accurate.  The CHT drifts a tad as the ambient temperature changes, but
it at least provides me an &quot;idea&quot; of CHT on #3.  

All my water cooled VW's had VDO, and aside from an actual broken gas
gauge (needle fell off), I've had zero problems.  There were bad temp
senders, bad tach sensors, bad fuel level senders, but the gauges were
always reliable, and accurate (tested with infrared thermometer and
candy thermometers).  

I'm more irritated at not having an oil pressure/oil level gauge, and
that my gas gauge only read 3/4 when full, and around 1/8 when empty. 

Heck, for that matter I'm more irritated that 90% of the time the radio
in the bus is on, there's a freakin' commercial playing.
