&gt; Any turbo enthusiasts out there?
&gt;
&gt; After reading through my latest  VW Trends magazine a couple of times, I
&gt; can't help but be intrigued by the idea of turbocharging as a way to give
&gt; our &quot;underpowered&quot; vehicles a bit more muscle.

The problem with any &quot;bolt on&quot; power is that the cooling requirements of
an engine go up with the power produced.

This is not generally a problem
with a water-cooled engine because the &quot;weak link&quot; in water cooling is the
radiator, which can be readily replaced with a larger item.

However the aircooled engine presents a much greater problem.  Short of
exotica like water-cooled heads, there is no way to increase the ability
of the stock VW cooling system to transfer heat to the atmosphere.  The
efficiency of the cooling system is already maxed out in the 1600 doghouse
configuration.

Turbocharging can indeed produce significant increases in power and
torque, but if you try and use the extra power for an extended period
(climbing a hill, or cruising at 85) you will soon have a very hot engine.
You _can_ get away with using it for acceleration or drag racing as the
engine has enough thermal mass to absorb the temporary heat overload.
That is why the bug folks get away with using turbos.

I, for one, don't think that I could restrict my enthusiasm for the
throttle to momentary bursts of acceleration.  I wanna climb mountains!
