Subject: Re: [T2] tire size problem

Have been lurking here a long time, but this is the first time I feel like 
I know enough to post. I have no idea if there's a website, but I can work 
out the math as follows, bear with.

How does it work, you ask?

On your tire sidewall are three numbers: tire width (in mm), the aspect 
ratio (how tall the tire sidewall is with respect to the width), and the 
rim diameter (in inches). On our 1978 westy, these are 195 75 14. Not sure 
if it's the same for all buses, but I'll use these as an example.

The first thing to do is to figure out the diameter of the wheel (rim and 
tire):

2*width*aspectratio/100/25.4 + rim = 25.51 inches.

One turn of the wheel corresponds to one revolution of the speedometer 
cable. Therefore, for one turn of the speedo cable you travel pi*25.51 
inches =6.68 feet (or 2.036 meters).

Now imagine you've got the wrong tires on. You can work out its diameter by 
reading the sidewall markings in exactly the same way. For argument's sake, 
lets say these are 225 45 17 (the wheels on my GTi).

In this case, 2*width*aspectratio/100/25.4 + rim is 24.97 inches. One rev 
of the speedo cable will actually take me (pi*20.98 inches) = 6.54 feet (or 
1.993 meters).

The fractional difference is 1.993/2.036 = 0.98. So my speedo reads high - 
when it says I'm going 100 km/h (60 mph) I'm actually only going 0.98 times 
as fast: 98 km/h or roughly 58.7 mph.

Collie's question can be answered as follows - from the above, I know that 
my wheel SHOULD have a diameter of 25.51 inches. If I assume the width is 
185, radius is 14, then I can rearrange to solve for the aspect ratio...I 
get approximately 79...so 80's your best bet.

IMHO.
