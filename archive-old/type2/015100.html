Subject: URGENT! Tranny Problems
Mime-Version: 1.0

Here is the problem.  Been doing a lot of highway driving in the last
couple of days. Dropped kids off at the In-laws so the wife and I could go
on vacation this week.  Went to the Resort (2 hrs away) and checked in.
Had to come back today for a meeting at work.  On the way to the resort, I
lost Reverse.  Last time this happened, it was just the lock screw coming
loose from the shift rod/input shaft connection.  Checked this already.
Well, I got home today, (after having left my wife 2 hrs away) only to find
now that I have no 3rd/4th.  It started by losing 4th. I could get into 3rd
if i took it up to about 25mph in 2nd and then shifted.  Now I also have no
3rd.  So. I am stuck. A bus, with 1st and 2nd gears, no 3rd or 4th, and a
wife 2 hrs away with no vehicle.  Any suggestions where to start looking?
And if so.. PLEASE GOD, let this be an easy fix. 

Tom Draffen.. 

P.S.   Steve Dolan.. give me a ring to see if you can help me with my
urgent dilemma. left my number on your answering machine.
