&gt; Hi Joel,

&gt; This is still very likely to be a CV joint problem. When under throttle the
&gt; CV joint-to-bearing surface is engaged differently than when coasting or
&gt; decelerating, and it could be that this is the bearing face that is galled.
&gt;
&gt; My bus used to only make the clunk after a left turn. Sometimes it would go
&gt; away immediately, sometimes it would persist for a couple of miles. My
&gt; mechanic repacked the CV's with fresh grease and they've lasted for
&gt; thousands of miles since.
&gt;
&gt; BTW, what's the recommended service interval on CV joints???   I think I may
&gt; want to check mine before I head off to Everybus. Adam, I think yours should
&gt; probably be checked too.

Supposedly, the interval is 30K miles.

In reality, unless you contaminate the grease, it should last a good long
time.  The grease does harden with time, but this hardening isn't apparent
in 3 year intervals.  I don't keep track of the miles on my CVs, but I
repack them whenever a boot goes bad.

George
