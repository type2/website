&gt; Ok. so today, and some of yesterday, i pulled the 3-4 side head off of my 
&gt; 1700 powered bus. Well even though some (read::all) of you had told me that 
&gt; i should just pull the engine and then take the head off. i didnt listen. So 
&gt; i left the engine in and took the head off. BIG MISTAKE!! It took soo long 
&gt; and was so difficult. I guess i didnt know what i was getting into. Oh well. 

BTDT.....

&gt; Live and learn i guess. Anyways the question is, for future reference, where 
&gt; should i place the jack under the engine when I am removing it? Also, What 

I place the base of the jack on the weight center point, but I use a
transmission jack and the base is quite large, and I have bolted a hefty
piece of lumber on top to protect the engine.

&gt; is a good item to use when plugging the gas line to the carb? I have rubber 

turn the angle cock on the shut off valve that I installed in the gas
lines many years ago.

&gt; lines on mine because I am using an electric fuel pump. Anyone else with 
&gt; that situation that can tell me what they use? Ok well,  Thanks for 

depending on the size a round pencil, an old valve, a bolt lots of things
will fit, but unless you have a shut off valve be prepared to get gas on
you....oh and they make a fuel line clamp too you can pick one up at your
local FLAPS for a couple bucks
