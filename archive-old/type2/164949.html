&gt; it won't run well enough to even get it timed with a light, and it won't 
&gt; rev up.

This still sounds like a vacuum leak, and have somebody else go over the firing order while you take a break, just in case.

My experience was that if I had anything wrong, timing, firing order, points adjustment, that it would blow off the vacuum line to the brakes or the breather, so every time I corrected an issue I would need to reattach these vacuum lines before trying it again.

Check your vaccum lines often throughout this process is what I am trying to say.
