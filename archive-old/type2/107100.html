Subject: Re: [T2] hyd valve adjustment procedure

Adam:

I've read the Boston Bob article and, I must confess, I don't completely
understand exactly what he's advocating here.  Let me re-phrase what I
*think* he's saying here and you can correct me if I'm wrong.

On a newly-assembled engine (like the one I have in my garage, which
probably won't be installed for a few weeks) is he saying:

1) Adjust all valves at .006&quot; lash.
2) Run for a couple of weeks that way.
3) After a couple of weeks warm up engine completely,
    allow to cool, though not all the way, then restart.
4) If noise comes from lifters, don't do anything, go to
    step 2)
5) If no noise, adjust all valves to 1/4 to 1/2 preload.

???????????????????????????

I'm even more unsure about what to do with an older, well-broken in engine.
I rebuilt the engine in one of my Vanagons about 3 years ago using re-ground
lifters.  If I recall correctly I set the adjusted the lifters at 1 1/2 - 2
turns.  During the 20 minute initial start-up the lifters pumped up.  If I
let the car sit a few days I consistently have one lifter that makes a
little noise for 5-10 seconds on start up, that's it.  So what's his advice
here?

1) Go back to the &quot;newly-assembled&quot; engine drill up above?
2) Re-set the pre-load to 1/4 - 1/2 turn?


Can you quote to us what the new Bentley manual says in this regard?

Thanks.

&gt; This preloading advice is VERY old school.  Preloading  does nothing more
&gt; than cause wear, improper lift and never allow lifters to pump.  Some may
&gt; have success with it, but I guarantee you if they adjusted there valves
&gt; correctly they could feel a difference in the seat of their pants, and on
a
&gt; dyno.  Most of the folks giving the preload advice give it for it is the
&gt; only way they have ever done it.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I probably have made $1000 in adjusting valves per www.bostonengine_dot_com
over
&gt; the last year and a half.  Customers claim it feels like they have a new
&gt; bus.  Follow the logic, it makes sense, AND not to mention it is the way
&gt; suggested in the new Bentley manual to boot.........
