Subject: RE: [T2] will it go faster this way?

&gt; Hey everyone!   Happy Friday!!!
&gt;=20
&gt; Time for Fridays crazy question...
&gt; Why is it that when you see someone driving a bus down the=20
&gt; highway at full speed,  they are always leaning so far=20
&gt; forward that their head is almost hitting the windshield? =20

Seems to me it appears that way because of the position of
the steering wheel.  To reach the 10 and 2 position, I find myself
with my arms stretched forward (more so than on a typical new car) with
my arms resting on the steering wheel.  I suppose that orientation makes
you lean a bit forward, or at least appear that way.
