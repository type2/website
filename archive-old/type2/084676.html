&gt;Hello All   Personally when I do a clutch job I'll only do it once

Really?  That sounds nice but how do you know that the parts you are 
putting in will work?  You don't.  Manufacturing defects happen.  Replacing 
all parts with new guarantees you absolutely nothing except a large cash 
outlay (of other people's money?).  The parts you already have in there are 
proven to work (assuming the only problem was a worn clutch disc) so why 
replace them?  If your policy is to replace everything with new, why 
resurface the flywheel when you can replace it with a new one?  As long as 
the engine is out, you might as well replace your oil pump with a new one 
too.  Why not replace your starter with a new one?  Might as well replace 
your alternator with a new one too.  Where do you draw the line?

The only time I ever did a clutch job twice was when I replaced my working 
throwout bearing with a new one, which squeaked like mad from day 
one.  Never again, but like you said, &quot;to each their own&quot;.
