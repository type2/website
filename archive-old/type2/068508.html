Subject: Re: Insurance Deal

I've got a couple of my collector vehicles with an insurace
group by the name of Condon &amp; Skelly. They are somewhat 
lenient of the use. They prefer under 2,500 miles a year, 
maintenance drives, the occasional pleasure drive and anything
on the way to shows are all ok. If the prefered milage may be
not enough send them a letter and they will sanction it. If it is
a garage queen they are a good deal they understand why we
have them.  When my bus is done I don't plan on falling in any 
of their mileage preferences, definately will exceed. My main 
insurace broker turned me on to them but they also advertise
in Hemmings. If anyone needs more info let me know.
