Subject: Re: [T2] removal of heads

Michelle-
Valve stem seals are installed during cylinder head rebuilding.
These go on the valve stem under the valve spring, and require
disassembly of the valve hardware with the cylinder head removed..
It is unlikely you need these unless you are planning the head rebuild.

It is more likely you meant to replace push rod tube o-rings at
the cylinder heads and at the case, a normal maintenance item.
These can be easily replaced without removing the cylinder head ( Type 4 ).
Release the bail on a valve cover and take the cover off for a quick look.
The tubes remove from the head after you have unbolted the rocker hardware.
Make a note of how the long bent wire spring is fitted to the push rod tubes.
( Type 1 push rod tube seals require the cylinder heads to be removed.)

&gt;i need to replace my valve seals and push rod tube seals.  i am wondering if
&gt;i need to lower or remove the engine to remove the heads and also what
&gt;gasket(s) will i need to purchase before i start?  another thing--i was
&gt;reading the article   &quot;Hydraulic Lifters and Type IV Pushrod Tube Seals&quot; by
&gt;John Anderson from the type2 library and i was wondering where i can find the
&gt;Viton seals that he mentioned.  This is what he suggested doing:  &quot;Do the
&gt;same to the bores over on the heads. Install Viton o-rings with silicone
&gt;grease (or at least oil) and those tubes won't leak again.&quot;
&gt;one more thing, does anyone know of one supplier that could get us all of the
&gt;above-- the Viton seals, the gaskets needed for the head and valve seals?
&gt;any help would be appreciated.  thanks, michelle
