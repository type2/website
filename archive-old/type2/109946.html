Subject: Re: [T2] Is there such a thing as a flat clearcoat?

Bob,

Good idea--

But the Testor's dull coat by the model builder's club would wash off
the tank the first time ole Courtney missed the filler hole with the
gas--enamel and bike tanks don't mix well--

I have painted my motorcycle tank and some parts on my VW bug flat black

the flat black is protected but doesn't become shiney?? 
there is for the model builders something called &quot;Dullcote&quot; (by Testors
I think) probably can find it at most hobby shops, comes in spray
cans....
