&gt; Hi Zac.
&gt; I too have a 73 that I am trying to determine the vac lines location. What
&gt; do you mean by Dashpot? And I am pretty sure the one that runs between the
&gt; two manifolds is to the brake booster.

my brake booster is run off of a outlet on my left side manifold.  my
balance tube has two connections that hook on the left carb, and one
connection that hooks on the right carb.  but in the middle of the
balance tube, directly underneath the air filter is a vacuum port.  i
plugged it for now!!  but it is a vac port for sure.  (i checked it
with engine running)...

the dashpot looking thing is NOT on the carb.  it is on the intake
manifold itself.  one on each manifold.  on both sides (left and
right) the *dashpot* has a vac port sticking out of it, point straight
out (pointing left on left carb...pointing right on right carb).  for
what its worth i do not have the stock smog equip, so those
connections might have something to do with that whole set-up.

make sense??  hope this description helps all....
