Subject: Towed bus is NH/Thanks

Hey I wanted to say thanks to everybody who responded with interest, 
sympathy, or offers of support with regards to my unfortunate bus 
situation.  This list is awesome.  A few folks even offered to lend me the 
money, interest free, sight unseen!

There is good news, though.  The bus will continue to live, as a nice guy 
from Portsmouth is picking up the tab and the car.  So folks in NH keep an 
eye out for a bright yellow bus bombing around.  And the kid who left my 
bus for the dogs has agreed to give me some cash to cover my loss.  So I 
lost a little money, but not my faith in the busma.

So since I am now busless, I'll be signing off.  Good luck and thanks for 
all of the help over the years.

Jeff
