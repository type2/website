I ducking already, but have a beautiful vanagon body with a bastard engine.
Looking to put an engine in that I am familiar with to make her a grocery
getter, as I do not want to spent the $$ for a new engine. This baby is
hacked, all FI stuff gone, single carb, etc...  It runs OK but don't trust it
(rear cooling tin gone, smokes some).

Anybody done it? Is it possible?

No flames please, as rust free bus is available to anyone who wants to buy it
cheap. :-)
