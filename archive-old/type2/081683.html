Subject: Re: &lt;FMBC&gt; Parts needed at EveryBus

On the same subject, I need the table arm from a 1969 European westie. I
have the table. I bet it is the same from a 67 but have no real idea. I will
be at EveryBus. Look for the overheated white Euro westie. :-(

Subject: &lt;FMBC&gt; Parts needed at EveryBus


&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I have two humble requests for parts. If anyone has them and would
&gt; like to &quot;unload &quot; them while they are at EveryBus, I would be very
&gt; appreciative.
&gt;
&gt; #1 A set of curtain rods from a Westfalia. I need all and then some
&gt; one to put curtains in my 68 that has no closet. So that would be 2
&gt; for the rear hatch, the curvy one over the sliding door and one for
&gt; each of the 3 other windows. I think 68 to 73 have one long one on
&gt; the passenger side and nothing on the right rear because of the
&gt; closet. For 74 up I am not sure how the layout works. If you have
&gt; them and can bring them to EveryBus that would be cool Juat contact
&gt; me.
&gt;
&gt; #2 This is for my main man, Roy. Roy has a 76 Westy but does not have
&gt; the rear table. He has the arm but needs the table top and whatever
&gt; the mounts are underneath it. I think this table has a flip up leaf
&gt; as well. If you have and want to sell it and can bring it to EveryBus
&gt; please email me with you price.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!!!!!!!
&gt;
