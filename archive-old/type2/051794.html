&gt; &quot;High-heat&quot; paint is certainly not needed in this application.  The

It's not just the sticking that is the problem.  If you put regular 
rustoleum on your tin, it will stink very badly as it burns off.  
And it will burn off.  Some of the tin does get very hot.  

	I suggest using a good quality engine paint.  Barbeque paint does 
sound like a good idea though.
