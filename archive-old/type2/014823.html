&gt;Although $99 is certainly appealing, in my estimation it's worth the
&gt;time and effort if you will be keeping the thing 100k miles to take the
&gt;chance on new ones for $45 each and get quality boots, and do it yourself.

I have an Idea, don't wait till your shafts get bad, replace them now with
good German ones. Then stuff your used, but still good one in the Bus incase
you need it someday.  Or scrounge the salvage yards until you find good used
ones and get yourself a little stockpile of good used ones and your set. I
bet I have thrown away 6 sets of good used CVs due to not needing them. I
have one set of 4sp and 1 Auto set left. I will save them for my Vanagon.
