Subject: Re: blinkers

I have removed a turn signal relay that was literally filled with water.
Replacing it cured the no blinker problem.

Windshield leakage is very typical in busses I have known. The old rubbers begin
to leak, water collects underneath and the metal rusts causing it to leak
inside. You'll need to fix the leak or continue to put up with relay replacement
and other electrical problems as well as wet feet.

Best,
Will
