I used to use the Felpro neoprene gaskets and they were pretty good,
lasting
several valve adjustments if they were properly glued to the valve covers
and coated lightly with permatex blue every time.  I figured out, however,
that the time required to do the proper clean and replace was more than
the cost of new cork gasket every valve adjustment.  That's the route I
take now.
