Subject: Re: [T2] sub-cultures

Must be you're not driving a &quot;cool&quot; bus :) I also have two J**ps; a 
sqaure-headlight Wrongler and a 2WD Grand Cherokee - talk about being 
snubbed by the locals...

Us Bussers should always stick together no matter the model. I saw a photo 
of a Bay on fire on some splittie's website - the caption read &quot;Fortunately, 
it was just a bay.&quot; What's up with that?

Guess that's what makes world go 'round though. If we all liked the same 
stuff it would be a pretty boring place.

The people in Atlanta are always nice when they talk to you, just bewildered 
by the camper. In fact, while getting gas the other night, I had a guy tell 
me that my &quot;car&quot; looked pretty good considering it was one of the first VW's 
ever made.

&gt;fatmac99 sends:
&gt;
&gt;I think it might be the area.  When I drive my Bus around (I'm 30
&gt;minutes -south- of Atlanta) I get strange looks, a couple waves, always 
&gt;waves from other AC VW owners.  When I drove a Bus up in the Chicago area, 
&gt;no one ever gave it a second look.  I also remember seeing more of them up 
&gt;there...
&gt;
&gt;So what's up with hot 'lanta? I'm in california, self-described vw hotbed, 
&gt;and busdrivers give me the shaft when I wave 8 times outta 10.
&gt;
&gt;Course, this is self-described yuppie hotbed as well. Also, being in the 
&gt;central valley, I sometimes think there's more rednecks here than the whole 
&gt;south. Don't take kindly to non 4x4 modes of travel.
&gt;
&gt;Yeehaw,
&gt;
