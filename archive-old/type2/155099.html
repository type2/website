&gt; Speaking of timing scales, has anyone attempted to make an
&gt; alternate scale, since these things are NLA?

If someone had one they would be willing to sacrifice, maybe an old
beat up one, I could make a pattern out of it and have a bunch of
aluminum ones routed out flat, all I would have to do then is bend it.
possibly even have them scribed with the scale on it if I could get
that too.

I will see if I can dig one up, but feel free to contact me if you
have any ideas or resources.
