That is a wire to a timing sensor that was used only for test equipment at 
the dealer. The plug was originally mounted by a clamp on one of the 
alternator housing nuts. You can tuck it out of the way or cut it off and 
never hurt nothin'.

&gt;78 westy......  There is a wire attached to the front of the motor above the
&gt;tin on the passenger side. It goes through the case right behind the flywheel.
&gt;It has about 18&quot; of wire on it and a three pronged plug attached to the end.
&gt;What is this?  what does it do?  Can I remove it?
