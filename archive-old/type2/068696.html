Hi folks,

Well, it was an unexpected &quot;VW weekend&quot; for me and my chum, the '71.  I had
spent a couple evenings last week working at night in 20-30 degree F temps
to install my new oil temp and pressure gauges.  This was a labor of love
and I didn't feel the cold as I painstakingly fitted my wiring harness and
made a careful, neat installation.  Having these gauges was worth the
inconvenience and I was playing it smart:  by doing this during the week,
I'd have the weekend free to just drive around and record data off my
gauges--ahhh bliss!  

It turns out the VW fairy's evil twin, the volksgremlin, was already playing
out my weekend for me.  But first, I was &quot;enjoying&quot; the fruits of my gauge
installation.  The new gauges verified something I already suspected about
my 70k mile 1600 engine: my oil pressure was low.  I suspected this since on
cold mornings I get a loud lifter-like noise that lasts briefly at startup
(despite my usual 10w40 winter oil which has served me well in the past even
on the coldest mornings), and at operating temperatures, the engine vibrates
the entire bus (mounts are OK).    I think Muir attributes these bass-like
vibrations as a clue to worn main bearings.  And to confirm it, at idle
after a highway drive, with engine temps at 210 deg F, the OP gauge read
9-10 psi, making the dual OP sender trigger my dash oil light.  The previous
stock sender did not trigger the oil light, though it was fairly new and
functional.  I haven't yet checked the body of the stock sender for the
specs, but I'm guessing it must trigger the light at about 3-5 psi.  Having
my low OP verified will at least inspire a quicker rebuild schedule (proving
that &quot;knowing&quot; causes stress--a good argument for ignorance ;).

Then, as I returned from work on friday, about 2 miles from home the
godawful racket of exhaust breakage from hell struck.  My passenger side
heat exchanger pipe broke just where the pipe bends to meet the flange at
the #1 exhaust valve.  Cursed!  Since I had promised to use my bus to haul
stuff to a flea market on Sunday, I spent all day Saturday locating the
muffler parts and installing a spare heat exchanger and new muffler.  I
replaced the German muffler with only 25,000 miles on it because it was very
rusty and I found a hole in one of the pipes where it mates with the j pipe
from the heat exchanger.  Apparently when I originally installed the muffler
I had tightened the clamps in this area too tight in my attempt to fend off
exhaust leaks from the dreaded donut gasket, and succeeded in cutting
through the muffler pipe with the clamp.  So I learned a lesson in the fine
points of muffler installation--something I thought by now I had mastered!!

Knowing that I'd be getting a new german muffler in a few months when I
finished my engine rebuild, I decided to install a new, cheaper brazilian
muffler this time, just to get me through the winter months.  As other
listies have warned in the past, the heat tube for the brazilian muffler is
on the passenger side, conflicting somewhat with the hot air elbow pipe
installation, and the heat riser flange on the passenger side was welded on
haphazardly at the factory.  Still, I managed to fit it and finish the work
before dark.

At the flea market on sunday I met some bus enthusiasts--one guy who has a
'73 westy that's rusty but running and he might be willing to sell.  The
other guy may have been a BS artist (my suspicion anyway), but he claims to
have gobs of old bus parts, 36 horse engines and carcasses on his farm.  I
had the sense that he was exaggerating or maybe even spinning a tale, but I
gave both guys my # and told them to call me with details and I'd post it on
the net.  I'll keep y'all posted on this.

Nothing like a VW to eat up all that nasty spare time in your schedule...oh
well, it's too late, I'm hooked (or in too deep now to divest)!
