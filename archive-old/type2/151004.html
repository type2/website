Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Electric Bay Window

While we're speaking of 'electric bay windows',  has anybody installed power 
window kits into their bus?  I remember a few years back there was a company 
that sold a kit that was a true 'hideaway'.  It replaced your regulators 
with power regs.  Are they still being manufactured?
