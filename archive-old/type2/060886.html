Subject: VW Bus Camping in Orlando
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I received a call from a fellow LIMBO member who was looking for a good
place to camp in Orlando near Disney with his 83 Vanagon Westy. Since I live
down here, I have never used the local campgrounds.

My 75 Bus is back on the road after a three year storage. It needs a lot of
TLC to get it back to where it was when I put it away. Has anyone gotten
their brake booster rebuilt at the shop in Dallas recently?

Thanks, Tim Hannink	Winter Park Florida
