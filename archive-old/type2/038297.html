I want to install a clock I bought at the Red Barn and while I am doing that, 
I want to replace the burned out instrument panel lights.
I took out the screws holding in the black panel and the cover is still 
attached by the heater control knobs (the blue &amp; red knobs). How do you 
remove these to get to replace the instrument cluster lights?

TIA
