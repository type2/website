 I've noted that Porsche runs a cooler on the front about 9

&gt;Are there general guidelines as to how far you can run oil cooler lines?

Note that the Porsche system was designed to account for friction loss in
those long, large diameter lines by putting in an oil pump some 5 times the
capacity of your VW engine. Note that the 911 dry sump system holds 9 to 12
quarts of oil, depending upon model, BY DESIGN.

Guaranteed you will reduce lubrication to your bearings with the extra load
of these aftermarket cooler &quot;systems&quot; which simply do not account for the
losses in efficientcy. Extra oil weighs more and the friction loss in the
oil lines, even if kept to very short dimensions, will be great, far more
than your oil pump can overcome, much less the great friction losses of the
high surface area in the extra coolers themselves.  

I'll say it again. If your stock, your not overheating. If your
overheating, your not stock. If your running the maschine in extreem
conditions, use your money to change the oil more often as advised in the
owner's manual.
