Hello All:
This quiz has been online for a long time so I know many of you have
seen it already, as I had. But, I got a good laugh out of reading it
again. check it out:

http://www.enter_dot_net/~bloss/vw/vwquiz.html

a sample for those leary of taking a random link:

********
If you answered D to more than five questions, not only do you qualify
to own a Volkswagen Bus, but you are exactly the type who NEEDS one,
especially the very old Split-Window Microbus or perhaps a Bread-Loaf
Bay-Window Bus. To decide for certain, put a half-pound of crushed ice
in your shorts, make a slurry of beach sand and pea-gravel with used
motor oil and grind it into your scalp, and stand out in the rain
overnight, smiling like an idiot ... because you know that Suffering
Builds Character.   If you manage that, you're in the club!
*******

happy friday!
