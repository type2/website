&gt; I've been debating on the black mirrors. The Guac looks really good
&gt; with chrome accessories, and the black would be jarring, IMHO. But I'd
&gt; bet they're better quality than the aftermarket chrome ones.

they are absolutely top quality (of course they are only two weeks old
too) but in putting them on they seemed well made and you could adjust
them very smoothly, which is a good way to judge mirrors, how hard are
they to adjust.  I don't know how they will strike you but I have been
taking off the small chrome bits because they are rust starting points,
not a real project but if they weren't needed and I removed them they
didn't go back,  the only exception was the &quot;VWAUTOMATIC&quot; logo on the rear
lid.   So I wouldn't hesitate to reccomend em.

as always YMMV
