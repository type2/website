Hi everybody, heres a  trip report on my trip to the Volks Folks Reunion
in Titusville Fl.  I left West Palm Beach on friday night to go to
Orlando to visit my dad and brother.  The bus ran perfect dring the four
hours of driving about 65 mph.  On saterday however, I smooshed my front
end. Someone slamed on their brakes in front of me, I swerved to miss
them but it was too late, thanks to my very loose stearing and crappy
brakes. 
So now I am in need of a new nose skin or a very straight unrusted nose
from the window down or the whole nose including the window frame, and a
passenger door.  The floors are rusty so I could also use left and right
cab floor sections.  The dent is not really bad but the nose already has
alot of bondo in it so I want to replace it. I could also use a new,
rebuilt, or tight stearing box.  This is all for my 68 bus.  I called
bus boys yesterday about a wide five disc  brake kit,  they said  by the
begining of next year they should have one for about 400-600 dollars.  I
want to keep the wide five bolt pattern.  Is there an adapter for the 71
and up discs to make it wide five. Anyway, sunday I went to the show,
the setting was very nice  and there were lots of nice VW's there.  On
the way home the bus ran great except for the oil going everywhere. I
forgot the put the cap back on after I left Orlando. Doh!!  If anybody
can help me with these parts I would appreciate it I want to fix the bus
as soon as possible
Thanks,

Jamey Gerardi
