&gt;Hey guys,
&gt;  In any case, I was thinking about using it, but then it
&gt;occured to me that it would probably rob a LOT of power from the motor...
&gt;
&gt;Well, in an attempt to fix my fiance's 1 year old washing machine, I decided
&gt;to just cannabolize it for parts. I pulled out a water pump, and a basically
&gt;brand new motor with a V-belt pulley attached to it. It got me thinking...
&gt;would it be possible to hook up this motor to the A/C compressor... either
&gt;directly (by welding the pulleys together) or by attaching a small V-belt to
&gt;them? Would the alternator be able to supply enough electricity to the
&gt;compressor as well?
&gt;
&gt;Any thoughts, ideas?

Quick answer:  NO

Detailed answer:
Seat of the pants estimate of HP required to turn today's typical rotary 
compressor: 3 HP
Watts per HP: 746
Watts needed to turn compressor at 80% efficiency: 2797.5 watts
Amps needed from alternator _at_ 13.8 volts: 202 amps
Typical amperage of a VW alternator: 45-75 amps (depending upon model)

Additional problem,
If I remember correctly, the laundry motors are no more than 1 HP at best.

Sorry,

Scott
