Subject: [T2] Type 2 engine for sale

For Sale:  Used 1600 DP engine.  Come drive the bus and hear it run.  This
is a healthy engine which needs some mechanicals; Generator brushed need
replacing, some oil leaks under the left side but no smoke.  It pushes my
1971 to 65 mph.  Everything that can be replaced has been replaced except
for the generator and starter.  It has a new .009 distributor .009 with the
Bosch coil, and voltage regulator.  Recently tuned top to bottom with new
spark plug wires.    Hear it run.  I will travel within sixty miles for
serious offers.

Reason for selling?  I have a rebuilt turnkey engine ready to go in.
