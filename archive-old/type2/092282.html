Subject: Re: [T2] Towing and Road Service

Check out Good Sam Emergency Road service-forget the amount, around $80
a year.  Has no milage limit (used to be 400 mi)- to take to where it
can be properly serviced.  I may argue my home is the best place to be
serviced!  It's for RV's, so plain bus owners may not qualify.  Yes, I
use their recc. National General Insurance; the Westy is considered a
RV.  If you have other vehicles, they are also covered.

I also have AAA plus with the 100 mile tow, with a max of 4 incidents
per year.  In addition, I have the Amoco travel club which also has a
 100 mile tow. So, for a total of $130.00 I can get towed 800 miles.
 Makes me feel real secure....... TBear&gt;
