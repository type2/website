Subject: Re: Carver (aka Propex) propane heaters

&gt;Actually, ARE there new parts (and complete new units) available?  Since
&gt;Espar is still in business, and is providing copies of their manuals, I
&gt;thought maybe they were still in the business of making these things.  Along

Well they still make gasoline heaters but most of their business is diesel
heaters these days (based on one of their recent brochures).  The latest
models they sell still look basically like something we would recognize as a
gas heater.  The BN4 series was discontinued long ago.  Last year I tried to
see if NOS parts are still available through Espar for the BN4--they called
Eberspacher of Germany and came back to me with the word that new blower
motors and fan assemblies (the part that would be especially nice to get
new) are no longer available (BTW, I'd love to be contradicted on this
point--anyone know of a NOS parts source for BN4s?).  

I have a suspicion that there might be stashes of NOS parts out there.  For
example, I was able to purchase a NOS BN4 blower fan from JB Heaters in
Colorado.  The fan came in a Bosch box--I wonder if Bosch is a European
aftermarket producer for some of these parts (??)--a post to the vanagon
lister awhile back seemed to have confirmed this possibility if I remember
correctly.  Can any European listers tell us if this is true?

&gt;the same lines, how much (roughly) do these things go for, used in good
&gt;condition (or new, if available and you happen to know)?  As I said in my

A used Eberspacher BN4 can go from $50-$400 depending upon the mental state
of the seller.  I think $100-$150 is a reasonable price.  Espar's latest
models sell for over $1000 new!!!  Now they probably have a lot more safety
features than our older models, but c'mon for that price, they must be safer
than a tofu salad on Airforce One (to paraphase a recent dirty shot made at
the Republican convention).

One of my brilliant-hairball ideas to get a newer model cheap was to check
out used commercial truck/construction equipment junkyards (most of the
newer heaters sold are used in these applications).  The problem with this
if you can find them this way (I haven't tried) is that you might end up
with a really well used model (maybe used more than one you'd find in a 20
year old bus) but at least you could probably still get replacement parts
for it.  Oh well, it's just an idea.  One v_at_l listmember awhile back told me
that he was installing a late model Espar in his bus--I think his father
worked for Espar--are you still out there?

&gt;previous post, the info I've got so far from Carver didn't have prices.  But
&gt;Chris Gibbs' original post said about $500.  That's another mark in the
&gt;&quot;con&quot; column for Carver/Propex.

Well, another issue is what kind of propane tank will you be using?  I
assume you won't be going through the hassle of retrofitting one of those
westy torpedo style tanks under your 71 so this probably leaves the not so
safe alternative of keeping a small propane cylinder in the bus, right? And
all that extra gas in your gas tank just waiting to be used by a gas
heater...;).

&gt;output is, and maybe the CFM if it says.  (I posted all the specs. for the
&gt;Carver unit because I thought other people might be contemplating a purchase,
&gt;too, and it might save them postage or a long distance call, but basically
&gt;all that I'm interested in is BTUs/KW and CFM.)

I'll look it up tonight and post the info tomorrow.
