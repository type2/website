Subject: Re: [T2] Metrinch tools, good???

&gt; &gt;I've yet to find a single (original) nut on the VW which is not metric, so an 
&gt; &gt;expensive set of dual purpose tools would end up being a waste of money when 
&gt; &gt;a cheeper metric only set will suffice.
&gt; 
&gt; In the U.S. at least, the seat belt hardware is not metric.
&gt; Probably not necessary to carry a special wrench for this though - how often do you have to mess with your seat belts?

But this is the US and there are quite a few other things you might want
to wrench on.
Now to the actual point.
The quality of the metrinch stuff is good and it is very compact and
convenient.
The only drawback is that it can be a bit loose on the hex due to the
design.
