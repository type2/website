Subject: Re: [T2] Your basic t toolkit?

I suspect this has been discussed before, so please feel free to respond 
off-list, if appropriate.

Can someone provide a complete list of basic hand tools for maintaining 
(not rebuilding) my 1976 bus? It has a dual carb &quot;pancake&quot; engine, 1800 I 
believe. Suggestions for any home-made or expendable items would also be 
helpful.

Is there an on-line manual that covers basic work. I am out here in 
Australia where books like this cost upwards of $60.

On another subject, I am unable to find out whether or not the previous 
owner used a detergent oil. What is the safest option for adding or 
changing oil at this point?

Thanks for your response.

Peter Nielsen
