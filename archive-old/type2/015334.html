&gt;Doktor Tim,

&gt;I couldn't agree with you more.  Why don't you get your butt off that
&gt;inaccessible rock island you live on and help real people here in
&gt;Seattle instead of just the rich ex-Californians up there!!??

Well, there's real people here to. In fact, I found in states and provinces
all around this one of ours real people as well. This is, however, the largest
concentration of ex-Californicators I have ever seen.

&gt;I know, I know, the living is easy and the money is good.  Or maybe the
&gt;living is good and the money is easy!

It costs 50 large out here for the down on a shack. I'm renting still.
I only got US dollars and the exchange rate for Californcadia dollars
is onerous.

Make me an offer. Do you know a shop manager who understands DM?
One that likes a loooow rate of comebacks? Will he let me handle all
communications with OUR clients??? Will help me with all our PATIENTS???
Can I earn enough to buy some dirt down there. You haven't paved absoultly
all of it yet have you??? Gee, where did we get that idea???
