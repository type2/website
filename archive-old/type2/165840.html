Subject: Re: [T2] HELP Diagnose Problem

The valve seat itself? No. Secondary damage - like a
bent conn rod or pieces of piston - yes.
BTW - That should be every 2nd revolution and not
every 4th revolution - not that it probably matters
much! I got my &quot;revolutions&quot; and my &quot;strokes&quot; mixed
up.

Before doing anything that would make it a LOT more
expensive to repair, somebody needs to pull the
head{s} and see what's up.

I am assuming a mechanical bang and not an exhaust
backfire type bang, so I may be assuming wrongly. If
it exhaust backfire type bangs, then it could be as
simple as one of those many hoses having come loose
from one end or the other. Visual checking is not good
enough - grab hold of each hose and make sure it is
firmlyseated on its nipple. Both ends of every hose.
The big fat hose toward the front that is vertical and
has hoses attached to it seldom comes off as it is the
only one clamped on. -BaH

 Humm. That's...finely technical. I turn the key it's
 big bad  noise from the 
 rear. Would a loose valve seat keep an engine from
 running at  all?
