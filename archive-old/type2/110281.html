Subject: Re: [T2] Calibrating my Speedometer..

Hiya Rusty,

I read your comments on adjusting the speedo.  Just wanted to say that my 
speedo is living proof for your theory.  The procedure you outlined is almost 
exactly what I did with my speedometer when I got the Bus about three years ago.  
I had to go the other way (counterclockwise) with my adjustment.  Adjusting 
the needle with a &quot;negative load&quot; (I had to actually &quot;hop over&quot; the needle stop 
to effect that negative adjust) really did the trick for me.  The speedo has 
been &quot;dead on&quot; at all speeds since.
But, I am going to be the very first person to admit that I was big time 
lucky in doing this adjustment.  I hit it dead on with my very first try.  I think 
that the downside of this method of adjustment (practically speaking) is 
simply that one has no exact way of being precise in determining how much of a 
negative load to put on the needle. The only way is to guess and check which can 
run into a lot of pull, reset, install, and checks.
But it did work for me - and I'm delighted!
