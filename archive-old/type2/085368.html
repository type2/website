Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel sensor accessability

Hi Volks,

I have a defective sender on my Westfakia, and I expect I'll be dropping
engine and pulling tank this coming Easter weekend.

Currently I keep track of my fuel needs with a logbook. I use the log to
track gas mileage and I date each fill-up, oil change, valve adjustment and
detail major maintenance items. I've also added some diary entries for
significant trips and events, so it makes for a better read. I usually
target 200 miles per tank, but I start hunting for stations at 150 unless
I'm close to home. I always fill the tank very full.

I have swapped a tank without removing the engine, but I had to pull the
carbs and lower the rear hanger about an inch to get clearance across the
top of the engine. At the time the carbs needed to come off to be cleaned
anyway. I can't imagine that you could swap a sender unit without pulling
the tank or cutting a hole, there just isn't room. Disassembling FI just to
avoid an engine drop wouldn't be worth it.

While the engine is out, I'm going to repaint the engine compartment and
replace the tranny fluid, and get rubber gaskets onto the heater flex pipes
to replace the missing asbestos parts.... There is usually something to do
back there you've put off if you think about it.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt;&gt; Andrew,
&gt;&gt; I also live about 12 miles from town, and I have the same model fuel guage:
&gt;&gt; reads well when tank is full but after 30 miles it reads empty. I am waiting
&gt;&gt; to fix it until I have to remove the engine anyway. In the mean time, I have
&gt;&gt; a post-it note on the dash on which I write down the mileage for the next
&gt;&gt; fill-up. To be on the safe side, I fill after 150 miles (250km?) even though
&gt;&gt; I get more miles than that out of a tank of gas.
&gt; 
&gt; Initially I did the same, except I used one of those little plastic mileage
&gt; indicators with the moveable dials so you can set it to any mileage.  Got
&gt; it at Poop Boys for a few dollars.  You could also do what I did later -
&gt; install a Vanagon speedo and use the trip meter.  :-)  I can almost
&gt; guarantee you that your sender is bad as my symptoms were identical to
&gt; yours.  I've heard that it's possible to swap out the sender with the tank
&gt; in place, without cutting through the floor!  If you're a contortionist
&gt; maybe?  Not tried it though.  I removed my tank while the engine was out
&gt; for a rebuild (and even then it was a dirty, PITA job).
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Just yesterday I filled up
&gt;&gt; after pushing the mileage limits a bit. The book says that the tank holds
&gt;&gt; 14.8 gallons but the fuel pump registered 14.9! I guess I cut that one a
&gt;&gt; little close.
&gt; 
&gt; I've put as much as 15.2 gallons in without running out, but I fill it
&gt; until the fuel level is 2&quot; below the cap.  I have to put the last 2 gallons
&gt; or so in very slowly.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Anyway, just set yourself a reasonable mileage range between fill-ups and
&gt;&gt; fix the sender when you have the engine out for other work.
&gt; 
&gt; I think that's a great idea!
