&gt; I have a 1977 with the type IV engine. There's a sensor on the engine 
&gt; forward of the oil pressure sendor, which looks a LOT like the oil pressure 
&gt; sendor, except it has two wires coming out with a multi-pin connector going 
&gt; to it.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone know what this is and where the wires go?

what is it plumbed into? it might be one of the vdo dual senders? one
end goes to the idiot light, and the other wire to the vdo pressure
gauge.
