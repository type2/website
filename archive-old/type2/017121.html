Subject: Re: 84 Vanagon Front Seats

Brian:

I seem to recall that the seats are the same from '78, maybe '77 through
'91 or '92.  I can tell you for sure that the nice Yellow bus plaid '76
seats I have are not compatible with with the seat tracks welded into a
friend's '78 -- that is to say, they won't just slide on, because they
have different track system.  However, you could make them fit, with
more or less difficulty, by swapping the tracks from your seats onto the
bottom of the vanagon seats, though I'm not sure how hard that'd be.
Somebody must've tried this, no?
