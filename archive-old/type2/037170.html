&gt;Can anybody out there recomend a good bus cover , the bus will be
stored in a unheated garage near Boston.Is anybody selling TYVEK  buscovers

FWIW, the primo 71 SC we bought a year ago today (24K ago, already!), has 
never been kept in a garage..or covered. Elderly PO,even more-so than 
me,claimed, at least in the dampness that is Fla, that a very regular 
wash/wax schedule is better for a vehicle over all. I realize this is only 
one example, but the 72 Nova we usd to garage 6 months at a time,would have 
1/4 inch of grunge, inside and out, when we came home. The stuff left otside 
fared much better. Unless it's spider droppings or such, I'd think a garage 
AND cover might be over kill. Just a thought.

Regards, Marv Krupp..lots of vehicles..most with grunge..so I'll shut up 
now..
