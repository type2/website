One: Eastward


I would rely on good fortune. By the morning I departed for Tucson,
this was the only option I would entertain.

It was not a rational choice. Steeped in pride and tenacity, I was
gambling that luck would be with me across one moderate mountain range,
several more ranges of lesser stature, and three hundred miles of
desert driving in Peregrine, my 1976 Volkswagen bus. I was betting that
luck would follow me to Tucson, in time to meet certain professional
obligations. I was hoping that luck would aid me on a leisurely return,
back across the desert and most of the same mountains.

I would rely on luck, and little more than luck. I thought of the John
Deweys tightly phrased homily: Art is the sole alternative to luck.
What I was intending was artless. The time for art, for the application
of human ingenuity and for meticulous attention to myriad details, had
passed over the weeks and months leading up to this mornings
departure. I had cut corners and I suspected, with some justification,
that I had made untried errors. I had used up all my time for art.

Now it was a matter of luck. But there was no reason to think that I
was betting my life. The stakes were of a lower order. I was gambling
only the ordinary perquisites of modern life: convenience, comfort, and
possibly  if I did not keep to my itinerary  a measure of reputation.
I was betting the very pride, if not the tenacity, that had brought me
to this test of small fortunes. I was not going to climb Mt. Everest or
K2, I was not going to traverse Antarctica, I was not going to paddle
down a raging South American river in a kayak. If fortune was with me,
I would merely drive from San Diego to Tucson and return by a more
circuitous route.

Was good luck my due? I must have thought so. Many who drive aging
Volkswagen buses speak of karma, in a popular oversimplification of
eastern philosophy. Surely, despite the shortcuts, I possessed good
karma. I had done good deeds, had thought good thoughts. Surely I would
make it to Tucson and return to complete the circle.

To enhance my karma, I declined to cancel morning classes. I fulfilled
my ordinary responsibilities, delaying my departure for as long as I
could afford to do so. As for my afternoon class, I had teaching
assistants who could take up the slack.

After my second class and a final glance at my e-mail, I walked from my
office to the faculty parking lot, accompanied by two colleagues.
Michael knew me well, knew of my plans and thoughtfully reserved his
judgment. The other colleague, Eric, was more of a stranger  such is
the way of the academic colleague  who, on learning of my plans and
then catching a glimpse of Peregrine, resorted to clichi in lieu of
conversation.

A Volkswagen bus! he said. If this vans a-rockin, dont come
a-knockin.

I winced at this. Eric is a vastly learned historian with a refined
taste for theory and a first-rate reputation for finding all the facts.
But I had once heard it said of him that his super-ego was like swiss
cheese, full of holes. I had just fallen through a hole.  I began to
curse Eric under my breath, but stopped myself. I could ill afford the
bad karma.

Peregrine is a bus. She is not a van.* Not all Volkswagen owners make a
point of this distinction, but I do. A van is a boxy utility vehicle,
produced by American automakers, with its engine located approximately
between the drivers and passengers seats. A bus is an equally boxy
utility vehicle, but with rounded exterior corners  like a bus -- and
with its engine in the rear. Ghost Dancing, the vehicle that bore
William Least-Heat Moon across Americas blue highways, was a van.
Peregrine is a bus.


*I have used feminine pronouns to refer to Peregrine since I named her,
not because I think that all vehicles are so gendered, but for a more
specific and disappointingly unrevealing reason that I will explain
later
