Subject: bleeding brakes

Hello,

I just installed a new master cylinder,  new rear slave cylinders and new
brake hoses, cleaned and flushed both fluid reservoirs.

Now I find myself unable to bleed the rear. We're using the 2-person method
with my wife slowly pumping the brake pedal while I open and shut the
bleeder valve. Front (first right then left) was no problem (although it was
bit long and tedious), but now we're stuck at the rear-right wheel. Pedal is
easy to pump, but neither air nor fluid comes out of the bleeder. I checked
the clearance between pushrod and MC and as far as I can tell, it's fine.

What could I be missing??  TIA for any suggestion!

Sami
