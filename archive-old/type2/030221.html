&gt; It's not a coincidence that VW changed the belt when they changed the

&gt; I laugh when the parts guys have belts that fit ALL upright engines with one
&gt; part #. Guys tear their hair out trying to find out why their engine is

&gt; Going to the alternator belt on BUSSES is a wise move to get rid of the
&gt; heat.

Well, I just adjusted my new belt after 400 miles and I took out the extra
shim, leaving all the stock shims between the pulleys.  I think that I
have about as tall a pulley ratio as I can get with the stock number of
shims.

I would still like the answer to two questions:

1. Is the alternator pulley the same part as a generator pulley?
2. What is the width and length of the &quot;alternator&quot; size belt?

These answers will probably clear up the confusion!
