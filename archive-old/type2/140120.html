Subject: Westy versus 8 passenger

I once owned a '68 transporter until it rusted out and then a '71 
Westy until it also became unusable. I like the features of the '71 
but  my camping needs are in my distant past.  I could use the eight 
seats of a non Westy for various family members.

Did VW make a non Westy in '71?

Jack
