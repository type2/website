Subject: [T2] Congrats to Wade...

Wade, the webmaster of AIRS is getting married this weekend folks.  He wrote
me of this the other day but I let it slip through the cracks with all that
has been going on.  I apologize.

Happy days ahead Wade.  I hope she knows what she's doing marrying a bus
guy.  : )

&quot;Lessons learned are like bridges burned, you only need to cross them but
once.  Is the knowledge gained worth the price of the pain?  Are the spoils
worth the cost of the heart?&quot;
