Hi volks,

I'm a bit confused.  Went camping this weekend and had the radio going,
bus off for about 30 minutes when the radio stopped and the bus wouldn't
start.  I thought dead battery strange because I  have run it for 6
hours like that before and never killed it before. Well next morning it
starts right up no jumping necessary.  Well go around stop and go all
over town no problems till I am ready to go home.  It won't start
jumping it does no good.  I checked the solonoid next to the starter put
the screwdriver to the nut and the elctrical prong and it made a
whizzing sound.  I also tired to see it the flywheel was stuck by
putting it in 3rd and trying to push backwards.
Any suggestions?  The engine is a 1800 in a 74 bus.

Peace
Snoopy
