&gt;The heads, to my untrained eye, look very nice. No dropped seats, no play
&gt;in the valves, no cracks, ect. Depending on how money looks two months from
&gt;now and the opinion of my machinist I'll either just get the heads cleaned
&gt;up or get two new heads from MSHP. If I'm gonna do it I might as well do it
&gt;right.

Don't make a blanket assumption that the heads you get from MSHP will be
better than your old ones.  If your heads are not cracked, not welded, and
have no spark plug thread inserts, your best bet will probably be to have
MSHP rebuilt your original heads.

&gt;By the way, neither Muir or the Haynes manual mention that you have
&gt;to unscrew the heat deflector (I think... it's a peice of sheet metal that
&gt;screws to the head and the case) before pulling the heads.

You're using the wrong manuals.  Get &quot;How To Rebuild Your Air-Cooled
Volkswagen&quot; by Tom Wilson (HP Books, red).

&gt;What do I need to do to upgrade to an 1800, since (unless I'm confused)
&gt;they use the same case? Suppose I put the larger P&amp;Cs in, would I need/want
&gt;different crank and cam? Heads? Since I'm replacing all that stuff
&gt;anyway... what other things would I have to replace? What about hydraulic
&gt;lifters? Do I just need lifters and camshaft?

All you have to do to upgrade from 1700 to 1800 is buy the 93mm pistons and
liners and have the heads opened up to accept the larger liners.  As long
as you're inside the case, you could go to 2 liters by changing out the
crank and rods, getting 94mm pistons and liners and again having the heads
opened up.  To do hydraulic lifters you will need lifters, pushrods, cam,
and rocker arm shims.

&gt;Oil cooler... this one doesn't have any major leaks showing and is clean
&gt;and solid-looking, but I understand that metal particles can get caught up
&gt;and cause another engine failure. Is there a reasonably sure way to
&gt;clean/test it? The replacement is a little bit expensive...

If there is shredded metal in your oil, you will be taking a chance by
using the old cooler, no matter how well it is cleaned out.  If the oil is
clean, you should be able to have the cooler flushed and reuse it with
minimal risk.

&gt;Paint. I'm painting all the sheet metal... is it necisarry to use
&gt;high-temp paint? If I can find a cheap powder coating place, I might, but
&gt;I'm not exactly made of money.

You can use cheap paint.  My favorite is the RustOleum professional flat
black at Home Depot (tall cans with different nozzle).

&gt;Fuel pump. This car came with an electric fuel pump mounted above the front
&gt;of the engine, middleish. Isn't a '72 supposed to have a mechanical pump?
&gt;I'm a little confused, 72 being kindof a border year and all.

It should be mechanical.  Look in the right front lower corner of the
engine.  Because of the presence of the electric, your mechanical one is
probably leaking or broken.  BusDepot sells new Brazillian ones but be
careful to measure how much pressure they put out before just hooking it up
and driving off.  Mine put out enough pressure to flood my carbs.

That's all I have time to comment on at the moment - good luck with your
ambitious project.
