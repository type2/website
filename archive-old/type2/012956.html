I bought one of those SVDA distributors from aircooled_dot_net and installed it on my westy last night.  This engine is a 1600 *single* port with a recent carb, and until lately I 
was using the dreaded 009.

I got stumped putting it in at first.  For one thing, the alignment tab on the cap (fits into square notch on top rim of distributor body) was 180 degrees different on the 
SVDA than the 009.  No problem, just unplugged the wires and rotated the cap 180 degrees.

Then got it all put together and tried to fire it up.  No go.  Fiddled with it for a while, comparing it to the 009, and made a strange discovery: the rotor position is 90 
degrees different.  Imagine yourself standing behind the engine looking down at the top of the dizzy.  When engine is at #1 TDC (confirmed by pulley notch, dizzy drive 
slot, and valves) on the 009, rotor points to about 4 o'clock, as shown in many of the manuals.  At same engine position, the SVDA points to about 2 o'clock, which was 
where my #2 plug wire was.  (I also have a 71 DP dizzy - 205Q - that points to 2 o'clock at #1 TDC).

The simple solution was to shift the plug wires 90 degrees around the cap.  Am I missing something?

Performance ain't that great yet (so far worse than the 009), but I don't think I'm dialed in right.  I just set static timing, but need to set it for full advance at 3xxx RPM (I 
think) to get it right, yes?
