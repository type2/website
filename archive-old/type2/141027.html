Subject: Starter trouble

I installed the Bosch relay kit in my bus to eliminate a balky starter
problem.  It worked for about one day. :O(

I'm wondering if the problem is in the battery cable going to the starter?

Sometimes it starts using the starter, sluggishly.  Most of the time I have
to roll start it.  Could the wiring be bad enough that the relay kit isn't
working, or could it be something else?

According to my VW mechanic, the starter is good.
