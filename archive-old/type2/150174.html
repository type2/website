Subject: Re: [T2] What VWs other than the Type2 came with power brakes??

Thanks Mark,

1. To get me on the road --- could I use this setup as a single circuit
system for a while? There are two ports each for the front and rear
circuits, if the front circuit is not working at all would moving both
front and rear to the back circuit cause me to have too much pedal travel
due to trying to move the extra fluid out to the wheel cylinders?

2. Is the larger '74 booster a bolt-on replacement on a '73 beam? I can rob
the '74 of its system to get me going again.
