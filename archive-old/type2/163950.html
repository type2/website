Subject: brake line length question

I recently got my '71 Camper home (my first ever VW), and am working
on replacing a brake line that burst open while bleeding the brakes.
The line that burst goes from the master cylinder to the rear T
connecter, and as I measured it, it is 86&quot; long.

Now on the busdepot_dot_com site, it says the center brake line is 33.66&quot;
in length, and on the autozone website the longest line they list for
the bus is 60&quot; in length.

Basicaly my question is this:  I know that I need and 86&quot; 3/16&quot; metal
brake line with metric threads, but where do I get it from?  Do I just
go to an auto parts store and tell them what I need?

I'm new to VWs and replacing brake lines, so I'm sorry for the n00b question.

Thanks!

-Mark
