Subject: Broken AFM in 78 FI Westy

Hey All,

Took the bus down to Newport, RI this weekend to photograph a classic 
wooden boat regatta (http://www.moy_dot_org/) with a friend who does it 
professionally (http://www.youngphotography_dot_com).  We have taken the 
bus down a few times this summer (from Portsmouth, NH), about a 3 
hour drive.  It works out well because some of the wharves will let 
you park at their docks for a daily fee (the boat owners usually park 
there) and Brown and Howard wharf has let us do it and camp there, 
only 10 bucks a day.  You get the advantage of being right downtown.

The bus was running a bit rough at idle, but I didn't have time to 
really look into it before departing, so I just raised the idle 
slightly.  She ran very well the whole way down (78 Westy FI) but 
started to run rough when we got into town, and would die at idle at 
stop signs and such.  I figured I had time in the morning to look at 
it, and maybe give it a tune up.  The next morning, she would turn 
over, and then just die.  Tried changing points, checking for vacuum 
leaks, and checking fuel.  Thought it might be the fuel pump, but 
couldn't really be sure.  Was very frustrated, so we went to shoot 
the race and give me some time to think about it.  When I got back, I 
tried to start it, and still no luck.  With the key on, I opened up 
the AFM cover and pressed the actuation lever to test the fuel pump, 
and it ran fine.  Looked in Bentley to see if they had any ideas 
(didn't have an ohm meter for testing) and came across the part which 
said the air flap may stick closed after a backfire, and we had had a 
few.  Took out the AFM, and when I looked at the flap, it had broken 
in half.  The other half was at the bottom of the tube.  It looked 
like a stress fracture, and I think that was why the performance had 
started to degrade.  I think it was slowly bending more and more, but 
still working, until it finally broke and wouldn't work at all.  Was 
able to get around it by bending the actuating arm away from the 
electrical contacts which won't let the fuel pump operate unless 
there is air flowing through.  Slightly dangerous, but was able to 
get us home on a holiday weekend.  She was able to cruise at 65 on 
flat land, but would bleed off speed on hills.  I had to be very 
delicate with the gas pedal, as the slightest increase in pressure 
would cause the bus to stall.  This would happen in all gears, and 
meant it took me a few minutes to get up to speed.  Lots of upset 
tourists behind me.  The gas mileage fell quite a bit as well.

My questions:  Can I replace only the flap, or should I put in a 
whole new AFM?  If a whole new AFM, is a junk yard one as good as a 
remanufactured one?  If I buy from a vendor, the prices vary hugely. 
Are all AFM's remanufactured, or are there new ones out there?  Any 
advice on these matters would be a great help.
