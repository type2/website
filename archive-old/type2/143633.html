Subject: Screwy Speedometer

Hiya All,

So........the speedometer reads accurately at a given speed.  I've checked it 
against the &quot;speedreaders&quot; that the local police set up in the neighborhood.  
The Bus is in stock shape.  

But it seems to be very slow on the uptake and the slow down.  For example, I 
can bring the Duck to a complete stop and the speedo will read 10 or 12 mph 
and still is slowly returning to the peg.  Accelleration seems slow also.

Question:  What would be the most likely cause of this symptom?  Speedo 
cable?  Speedometer itself?  Or some other paranormal cause?

Mike
