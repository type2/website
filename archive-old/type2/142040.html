Hi Dan,

Rather than ramps, I would recommend buying jack stands.  Good 
quality ones are safe and you can use the emergency brake to 
lack and then turn the wheels.  You can easily get to all six 
bolts on both ends of the axel by turning turning the wheel once 
about 180 degrees.  You will find that the ability to turn the 
wheel not only makes removing the axel easier but it will also 
make installation and retorque much easier.

Jeff
