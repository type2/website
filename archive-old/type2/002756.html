To list
  With the lack of oil pressure and the smoking of the 1600, Ive decided to
do my first rebuild. Want to catch the problem before I need to replace
whole engine, think it will be less expensive this way.
I want my daily driver to be able to leave the city, with no worries.  Ive
taken it off the road yesterday and puling the engine tomorrow.  Any heads
up from the experienced rebuilders?  I have a local guy in town who does
rebuilds, he wants me to do it, but will do machine work.  So thats where I
stand
