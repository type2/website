Subject: Sagging rear of Bus

Hi,

 

Bill M of Mystic mentioned &quot;Load leveler shocks in the rear&quot; in his posting.

 

The rear of my '79 Westy is sitting a little.  I've been thinking about
adjusting the height - but have been told that it could be problematic due
to rusty nuts and bolts.  Load levelers in the rear sounds like an
interesting alternate solution. 

 

I would be interested in hearing comments from the group as it relates to
the options for lifting the rear end - adjusting v load levers and, if
possible, recommendations for load levers.

 

TIA

 

Wayne

'79 Westy
