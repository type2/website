Greetings..from Sanford, Manitoba..Canada..(approx 20 km's from Winnipeg)
..ya  ya  I know...9 months of winter  and 3 months of tough sledding

Just a newcomer to this internet e mail stuff..
really appreciate being able to read all about Type 2's
currently have 2 transporters.. 73  and 78.
and  no..we don't drive them in winter...
you'd need 5 gas heaters  to bring up the ambient air temperature  to frost
mode!

Up here VW's  are driven primarily as you would motorcycles...(fair weather
vehicles)..
I have driven a 73 Transporter thru 2 winters..but it is akin to operating
a snowmobile..minus  the windchill..

Keep  the rubber side down...
Glen Schattner  ( the Shat )
Sanford, Manitoba.
