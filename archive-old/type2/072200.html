&gt;I am thinking of making my curtains out of something like vinyl screening.
&gt;Denise and I love being able to see the road. We can see out and the light
&gt;coming in will be cut. We like to keep the emptiness of our parked bus in
&gt;plain view to avoid break-in damages. I will update you all when I find the
&gt;right screening/mesh.

I always wanted curtains so others could not see in.  Your &quot;curtains&quot; will
be very intertaining for the other campers at night!
