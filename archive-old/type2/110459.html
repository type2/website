&lt;&lt; If putting food on the table is an important issue-- maybe VW's shoudn't
be part of your life right now--they are like paying rent or feeding the

Hey, waitaminute...When the Bus was built, it wasn't any more than a
Ford or Chevy van...Different but no more. If time and the vagaries
of fortune have made it collectable, then so. But it's still an owner-
servicable vehicle built to be used...Work van, camper, or Trailer
Queen; your choice...It was &quot;cheap, dependable wheels&quot;, once, if the
owner chooses to keep it as such, then it's his/her choice...Drive it
till it's used up...
