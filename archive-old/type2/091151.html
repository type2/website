Adrian,

The good news is... RIGHT ARM!!!!  Yeah!!! biodiesel will work as
described!!!  The bad news is that even wiht the larger engine and turbo,
you still *can't* &quot;cruise with ease.&quot;  The limit on the Vanagon diesels is
not the engine, but the trans.  To get the low HP original ngine to work,
the Diesel transmissions are geared LOW!  Whatever higher HP engine you
plan to install, if you plan to do more than 55 for extended periods, plan
on a new higher-geared transmission!!!!
