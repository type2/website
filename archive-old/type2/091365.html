&gt; What does it mean for the points to bounce?  I've read this several
&gt; place but I'm not sure what it refers to.

I think this is refering to a distributer that has worn out. The shaft
now will move side to side off center. sometimes opening the points
correctly other times not. It us usually first seen by watching the
dwell change when you rev the engine. Bentley give a figure of
variance &amp; I believe it's like 1degree +- but not sure. Consult
Bentley for the proper number.

&gt; I'm starting to understand the ignition system better.  With new
&gt; points and the bus running well, a stroboscopic timing light shows
&gt; that the engine sometimes doesn't always fire at 7.5 BTDC.  It's not
&gt; regular but still happens and you can hear the engine timing change
&gt; for that brief second as it fires a little later. Also, when the
&gt; dwell is set too high starting is really hard. A lot of gas pumps in
&gt; and there is a big stink when the engine finally starts.

So are you saying that your dwell changes? It shouldn't, at least not
much. I just recently replaced my distributor because of this same
problem. runs much better now.

&gt; As I understand it, electronic ignition smooths out both of these
&gt; conditions: starting and idle.

sorta. It is another way to trigger the spark &amp; develop a magnetic
field in the coil which when it collapses causes the nice type of
spark that will jump across a gap in a spark plug. But neither system
will let you get the most out of your engine with a worn distributor.
I would check it.
