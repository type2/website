Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Engine Question

  There is a guy on this list Nick Keen that is running a 78.8X90.5 in his bus and Matt here in town just built a 84X90.5 
for his bus. I run a 74X88 and am building a 82X90.5 for another one of my buses now.  All these engines so far run 
great and Nick is on his second one, got over 150K on his first. I now have 64k on mine nowand will put another 5K on 
it in the next 4 weeks.

&gt;I was wondering if anyone on the list is running a 2187cc, 78.8 x 94,
&gt;type 1 motor in their bus? If so, please p-mail me as I would like to
&gt;ask some questions as to how it's set up, cooling, performance, etc. No
&gt;flames please. I'm not a purist when it comes to my bus. But it looks
&gt;damn good!!! TIA
