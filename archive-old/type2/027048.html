Hi Tim,
Yes, the pressure for a tire to wear evenly depends upon the weight it is 
carrying most of the time. And the sticker that comes with the vehicle is 
based upon assumptions as to the tire size it comes with and how much weight 
it might carry in the future. Usually the manufacturer of the vehicle errs 
on the size of conservatism, tending to overinflate (for example assuming a 
maximun load on board) so as to avoid overloading the tire and causing 
blowout (except, witness the Explorer where the recommendation was on the 
liberal side so as to lower the center of gravity by means of softer tires, 
resulting in some blowouts). There are tables of the maximum load a tire can 
carry at a given pressure, but I'm not sure if the result of using a tire 
and weight at the recommended pressure will result in even wear of the 
tread. So I think the best way to go is to observe how one's tires are 
actually wearing over the miles, and adjust accordingly.
My experience is with a 75 Westy which came with the 185-14 reinforced 
Michelins, still has them, and is recommended on the sticker to be 30/40. 
When I looked at the weight carrying capability at those pressures, I found 
that given the weight of the Westy and its distribution, adding my weight 
(200 lb) and my wife's weight (which will go unreported), that the weight 
carrying capacity was mush more then what I would subject them to viturally 
all of the time. Even at 26/34 I am well below the weight carrying limit. So 
get the weight and distribution factors for you van, figure your weight and 
the weight of stuff you typicaly carry, read the tire table, and act 
accordingly, Then observe what is happening to the tread.

&gt;
&gt;OK I have to ask for some clarification here.  I was at the junk yard and
&gt;the bus I was pulling parts from had a OEM tag that said 36 front 42 rear.
&gt;I keep hearing every one argue it back and forth and that is fine but I 
&gt;hear
&gt;this &quot;loaded vs unloaded.&quot; argument.  should I put more air if I have a
&gt;heavier load?  I mean I weigh 300 or so pounds alone.  That is a lot 
&gt;sitting
&gt;atop one tire.
&gt;
&gt;I also use Dusty as a work vehicle so most of the time I am hauling lots of
&gt;weight.
&gt;
&gt;Any suggestions.
&gt;
&gt;Tim

&gt; &gt; I agree with William on the tire pressure issue. If you run at 30/40 
&gt;with
&gt;no
&gt; &gt; extra gear on board that adds weight, you'll find the center of the 
&gt;tread
&gt; &gt; wears much faster than the edges. On the trade-off, I'd take even
&gt;wear/ride
&gt; &gt; comfort-control to fuel economy. The cost of replacing unevenly worn 
&gt;tires
&gt; &gt; is not insignificant; and the carcasses are an environmental pollutant
&gt;too.
&gt; &gt; So I run Michelin R's at 26/34, unless I'm loaded for travel.
