&gt; analysis of why he thinks &quot;engine is shot&quot;, at the very least.

if the engine is shot' out of oil shot, you shouldn't be able to turn the
crank.   will it crank with the starter?? can you take the pully end of
the crankshaft (ignition OFF) and turn the crank over, you should be able
to feel it if something is broken.  if you cannot turn the pulley at all,
good sign engine is siezed, if you can turn it easily I would look
elsewhere for your problem before tearing the engine down.  while this is
not 100% foolproof it is a pretty good and easy check
