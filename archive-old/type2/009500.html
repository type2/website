A Hydraulic lifter simply relies on the the same principle as brakes- that
fluid is not very compressible and thus can transfer movment of a part and
hold it while pressure is appled.   It uses oil between pistons in its body
to provide the noncompressible fluid backing that allows the &quot;no play&quot;
transference of force from the cam lobe to the rocker arm.
If you look at the lifter anatomy, there are 2 areas oil can get in/out: 1.
there is a flow of oil pressure from the center of the pushrod tube into
the hole centered in the visible &quot;piston&quot; under the snap ring- which then
flows around the piston by a little side hole into the groove of the lifter
body.  This lubricates and &quot;seals&quot; the upper piston, which has about 3.5 mm
of free play if you push it down against the spring beneath the lower piston/checkvalve.
*  When you adjust the valve with 2-3 turns tighter after the rocker screw
contacts the valve on a cold engine, you are centering the piston in this
range of free play and you DON'T need a pumped up lifter to do this.  JUST
TURN THE ADJUSTOR SCREW LIGHTLY AND YOU CAN FEEL WHEN YOU HIT THE
RESISTANCE OF THE SPRING.  As long as the piston is not close to bottoming
out at either end during changes in this free play (engine gets hot, wear
in valve train, stretching/deepening of valve seat), you have a
&quot;self=adjusting&quot; lifter.  Given the worst case scenario, the seat is
pounding in and this range is decreasing, you'd never know it until you
dropped the seat and lost compression/power!  If you keep track of your
exact # of turns based on the angle of the adjustor screw groove, you could
notice unusual lessening of the free play if you readjusted the lifters
every 10K, ie.    I have a 78 bus and my feelings on the lifters are mixed-
with over 200K on the original unrestored engine (the lifters were changed
around 100k when a garage claimed they weren't pumping up)....there is very
little wear on the valve train, certainly not like what is seen in an
engine where there is &quot;slapping&quot; of the gaps possible between cam
lobe/lifter, pushrod tube contact ends, and adjustor screw/valve stem.
Because of the heater box location, adjusting these valves is a PITA, and
thus hydraulics save on a lot of dirty hands, misalignewd valve cover
gaskets, etc.....if you mistrust not knowing your valve health as with
constant solid lifter adjustments, it's far easier to pull the plugs and do
a compression check more often to check on your engine health.   Or do the
poor man's compression check with the rpm meter a
nd shorting out one plug at a time while engine is running to pinpoint a
weak cylinder.
   2.  The large groove around the lifter body has a hole in the side which
allows oil to get in from engine oil pressure and &quot;fill&quot; the cavity between
the 2 pistons.  If this hole is facing down, the lifter can drain out
fairly quickly (especially when oil is hot and thin) even when parked and
restarting the car a few hours later.  The lower piston has oil under it
also, and there is a check valve in its center- when reassembling the
lifter under oil, you push on this valve with a bike spoke as you push it
back down so the pressure is released and trapped air/oil gets out.  You
bleed a lifter mostly to ensure no compressible air under this piston,
since it's much harder to drive it out hoping that oil pressure will push
the check valve and drive it out as the engine runs.  I see no reason to
take apart &amp; bleed a purchased lifter, since it has oil under the lower
piston and this will evenually exchange with engine oil.   New lifters
don't have oil in the central cavity &amp; I usually do
 this to ensure a faster pumpup of a new lifter: Just put it under oil and
pump the piston to its bottom travel and let it back up- oil will be pulled
in and air driven out.  Reinstall it with the hole UP!
     If you want to reassemble a cleaned lifter, place it under oil and
pump the check valve in the bottom with a bike spoke to release air as you
slide in the lower piston.   Finish by pushing the lower piston down until
it clears the side hole, and insert a bike spoke threaded end to keep it
down while you slide in the upper piston- you must angle the spoke to wedge
the lower piston down far enough to get the piston down to freely insert
the snap ring.  It's also possible to push down the piston with a drift
while you replace the snap ring around the drift, but it's easier to do the
former when alone.  I'm sure if you did this all day, a press can be
devised that holds the piston down for reassembly.
