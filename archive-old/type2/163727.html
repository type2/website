&gt; I have this bookmarked at work, but for the life of me cannot Google it up 
&gt; to
&gt; look at it here at home. There is a fellow on the web that shows step by 
&gt; step
&gt; replacement of inner and outer rockers for a Bay with many many pics. Can
&gt; someone point me to it?
&gt; many thanks,

This one...?
