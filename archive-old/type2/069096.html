Subject: Another tire question

I know this discussion was happening a while ago, but I couldn't find it
in the archives.  I'm going to be putting some new tires on the old bus,
and wondered what some good ones are.  

Here's what I had in mind; something like the Goodyear Wrangler.  I know
they're an off road type of tire, but I want something that will be good
for camping and for snow too.  We just had a snow storm here and I
discovered my tires are nearly bald.  Has anyone put these tires on their
bus?  I drive a '74, BTW, and don't really care about road noise/loss of
ride quality that you get with off road tires.

Thanks,
Craig
