&gt; The engine will start, and rev up a bit, then fall off and try to stall a
&gt; few seconds later.  If I give it a little gas, it'll come back up and
&gt; eventually stay running, but rough.  I put a timing light on the ignition
&gt; wires, and each causes a flash every time like it should, so I know the
&gt; ignition is ok.  Another thing, when it does finally idle, it'll only run
&gt; about 2 minutes and then just fall off and stall.  I still cant find the
&gt; timing mark, so I dont know where the timing is, but its close enough now
to
&gt; run at least.

Do you have your timing scale in place?  The timing mark on the pulley is a
single very shallow line on the *front* of the pulley.  Find it, mark it,
and make sure your timing is correct so at least you'll know that part of
the puzzle is in place.
