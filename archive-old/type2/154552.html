Subject: Re: [T2] Wire harness

Order your harness direct from The Wiring Works.  They are the supplier for 
everyone anyway.  I have replaced a few harnesses with ones from the Wiring 
Works and they are OE quality .


I have seen a few folks put together their own wiring harness in the past. 
Problem is if the car gets sold, or anyone else is going to work on it. 
Flow charts in the repair manuals are out the window then, and automotive 
electricians aren't cheap.
