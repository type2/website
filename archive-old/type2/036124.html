Subject: Re: cross-drilled brake rotors

Cross-drilling doesn't do anything for braking, unless there is water on
the disk that needs to escape.  My experience with cross-drilled
motorcycle discs shows that They _do_ promote uneven wear of the disc,
meaning you have to machine them more often or wait a long time for new
pads to bed in.

Cross drilling is common in racing, where they're trying for the last 1%
of performance, which makes it popular with the really-big-tailpipe crowd.

&gt; second-has anyone cross-rilled their rotors, or is there a place to get
&gt; vented rotors??  or what kind of shop should i look for to get this

&gt; replacement part.  not like putting discs on a bug, where the spindles and
&gt; all need to be replaced.
