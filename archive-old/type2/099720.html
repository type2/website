Subject: Vent system mystery

Hey Everyone!

Any ideas on this one? :-).  When I turn the &quot;Fan&quot; knob to the left to test 
out the vent system, a noise comes from the front that sounds like a 
airplane taking off.  I called the previous owner for a clue and he stated 
that the 4 years he owned the bus, he never fixed it.  The PO before him 
had put in a GM part but he did not know what it was.  The PO said, &quot;Yeah 
the heat and air never did work very well&quot;.  I got the handy work light out 
and went investigating under the front but I'm not sure what I'm looking 
at.  Under the bus there seems to be a &quot;radiator&quot; looking part.  There is a 
similar part under the middle of the bus behind the propane controls.  I 
looked through the Bentley manual and found nothing.  I hope this is not a 
stupid question.  Can anyone give me a clue on where to start or a 
description on what the vent system is supposed to sound like?  Better yet 
anyone have some troubleshooting tips on getting the vent system working?

Thanks in advance!,
Don Manzano -- Excited new owner!
