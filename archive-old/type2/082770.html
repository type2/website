Subject: RE: Busted for Speeding!

&gt;I was driving north from LA, California through the mountains. I 
&gt;was doing a respectable 70 mph  when a late model loaf blew by me 
&gt;at easily 90 mph, UPHILL! 

I always wonder what other bus-drivers think when I fly past them at SUV speeds 
in my 73 Westy.  They must figure I'm an idiot and they'll see me broken down 
on the side of the road before long.  I always smile and wave :)  That 5-sp 
tranny is good for one thing: SPEED!
