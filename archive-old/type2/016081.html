Ok,

I try to follow the list wisdom, as we [on the list] do things different.
We all tend to tweak and pull our engines a lot more than the VW factory
likely considered &quot;average&quot;, so they thought you can deal with the damn
exhaust donuts once every 60,000 miles .. but we all tend to do things more
often, right :)

So I heard Ken and others rave about welding flanges on and then using a
gasket + two nut &amp; bolts.

Yep, I'm sure that 98% who try this found it to be a piece of cake -- but
me, I seem to have trouble with everything.  I even enlisted the help of my
intelligent girlfriend to help me master the introduction of welding.
Bought a welder, this was non cosmetic work, so I figured it was good
learnin' time.

What I learned:

  -- The #1 issue is alignment, the two flanges must be in sync for the bolt
holes to line up.
  -- I believe Hoover and others recommend putting the muffler and heat
exchangers on the bus to do the welding.  I started by welding the flange on
the muffler, outside the car, then grinding it down to get a perfect seal.
However, to ensure alignment of the two flanges (hole to hole alignment), I
put it on the bus before doing the heat exchanger side.  This doesn't work
well at all on 1968 later busses with support bar.
  -- I also put a set on my new engine for 1963 truck, no support bar.  This
welding wasn't easy for me.  You are trying to weld a circular seam, not
cover the bolt hole areas, and well -- for me it isn't easy.  And also just
as difficult to grind the mistakes off :)  You have to get the weld right at
the seam where the pipe and flange meet, all the way around.
  -- Then of course, I consider that what if I want to swap parts -- gee,
what is the likely hood that any of my muffler / heat exchangers sets are
going to match alignment of the bolt holes :)

I love the idea, as I also hate the donuts, but using flanges just opened up
a new set of problems for me.

Perhaps if the flanges had a groove instead of a hole, they might work
better.  Don't heat risers have a &quot;groove&quot; instead of a hole where one side
connects?  Instead of just a small holes -- that must line up.  Of course, a
larger size flange would be a problem with the 1968 and later bus support
bar, wouldn't it?

Yep, I really have no talent, and I turned a simple design improvement into
leaking exhaust flanges that I can't remove :)  I will likely have to drop
the heat exchangers (and muffler) to take them out and properly grind /
weld.  Well, maybe not properly -- but better than I did trying it around
the engine support bar.
