Subject: Rear seal leak vs oil pressure gauge port

In an attempt to check out the leak on the left side, I put a small 
(narrow) oil filter on temporarily to be able to see where the leak is 
coming from above the oil filter.  Cleaned everything up, tightened the 
oil cooler nuts by reaching a wrench behind the engine hanger, and ran 
the engine.    The oil does not appear to come from the seals that are 
visible, but higher up near the narrow end of the oil cooler. - you see 
it building up in the air gaps of the cooler.  If this were an engine 
oil seal wouldn't it also drip on the right side? Can a real engine seal 
leak cause a drip that at worst (engine cold, pressure high) is every 2 
seconds?  It lessens when pressure drops, suggesting the pressure gauge?
I'd think a engine seal leak would be constant?
The oil pressure port visibility is blocked by the electric sender of 
the VDO gauge- when I put it in, I shimmed a wrench between the electric 
terminals and tightened it.  Why are there no flats on this thing?  I 
tried it again and it would not move without bending the terminals so I 
assume it is tight. I guess I'd have to pull the distributor and try to 
get a vice grip on it. If it leaks there, the air blowing over the 
cooler could spread the oil
