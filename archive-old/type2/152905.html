&gt; And I guarantee that they could burn rubber with the best ofthem.
&gt; But...every one of them that I ever saw come into the &quot;sevice&quot; station
&gt; where I worked was just hotter than a firecracker!....much hotter than our
&gt; bus and bug engines get!

&gt; Cheers, dave

   True story:
Far away (and in a previous century) I worked in a gas station, pumping
petrol...A loud and ominous sound came down the street and pulled into
the station...It was a Corvair, driven by a not so little old lady, and the
rear of the car was shimmering with heat and a cacaphony of heavy metal
sounds. She stopped the car (but not the noises) and I grabbed an oil-
soaked rag and opened the engine cover...The remains of a fan belt were
scattered about it. 
&quot;What happened?&quot; she asked me.
&quot;Broken fanbelt,&quot; I ventured, &quot;How long has it been making all these noises?&quot;
&quot;It started about a half hour ago...What's the matter with it now?&quot;
I went into the bay to get the mechanic (who was fond of strolling into work
after breakfast at the tavern up the street with a six pack under his arm).
He came out and looked at the Corvair, turned, and started to walk back to
the bay...
&quot;What's wrong with it?&quot; the lady called to his back.
The mechanic turned around and calmly said, &quot;It's broke, lady, it's broke...&quot;
