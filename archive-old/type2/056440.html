&gt; Today I am the proud but very broke owner of a NEW 2-liter engine!
&gt; One catch: my warranty doesn't take effect until I add an EGR filter to my
&gt; 1978 camper.  I have no clue where to find one.


I now once again have the '75-78 EGR filters available, for $119.95. (They
had disappeared from the market for a while.)  Also have the '79-83 versions
for about $30 more.
