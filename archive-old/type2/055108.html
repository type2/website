to chime in here..

I drive a '77 FI and
the only thing I do is avoid lugging the engine down.
After taking my crosscountry road trip I got very
accustomed to having the pedal floored - 
in head winds or hills for example.  

Two times I accidentally
drove home from work (interstate) at 65mph in third gear!
Not that I'm proud, but the engine felt cooler 
afterwards than it usually does - I guess all that extra 
cooling air.
