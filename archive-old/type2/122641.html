Subject: gauge sag...another question

Okay...so I've been getting my brain prepped for installing all my new 
VDO gauges in the Brazilian Double Cab.  I took the instrument cluster 
out today to do a little exploring.

Finding:
#1...spare gauge hole (right of speedo) does not have a removable back, 
as in my other Bay.  No VDO tach there.  I decided to mount the tack 
under the dash, between radio and glove box, in an existing whole.

#2...wired constant power to fuse box, put the light bulb power onto 
the headlight switch, and ran my ground to a screw under the dash.  All 
is happy.

#3...the Bay window radio delete plate does not really fit in the radio 
slot in the dash.  This is a bummer, but I've decided to use this whole 
for my small gauges.  They are all prepped and ready to install, but 
there is a dilemma.

Do I make some sort of plate, in which to drill the holes for the 
gauges?  Any suggestions here.  Has anyone tackled this method.

Thanks,
mjr
