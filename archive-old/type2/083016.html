Subject: Re: [[T2] Fw: ticking Engine on full power &amp; dropped valves]

&quot;David Whiteley&quot; &lt;davew_at_trelales.freeserve.co_dot_uk&gt; wrote

&gt;Does anyone know why these 2L engines drop valves so much?

Yes. =

1.Because people don't maintain them or operate them properly - like lett=
ing
the engine run low on oil. =

2.Use of low-quality aftermarket heads. =

3.Seat jobs and head rebuilds by questionable shops.

&gt; Dont know for sure but a ticking was the first
&gt; indication
&gt; that I had dropped a valve seat on my 74.. =


Your drawing an inference that the ticking was a symptom of an impending
dropped seat (if thats what it was) may or may not be true.

&gt; I suspect you should be able to pull the valve covers
&gt; and perhaps be able to see if all of the seats are
&gt; at the same level.. (brass looking color).

Wrong. You see can only see seats when you pull the heads. You are lookin=
g at
valve *guides*.
A valve guide coming loose is serious, but not as serious as a dropped se=
at.
To look for sinking seats,  pull the rocker assy. and lay a straight edge=

across the stems. The high ones are suspect...
Watch for a particular valve clearance tightening up at each adjustment. =
Hold
this valve/seat suspect.

You know why you see puffs of oil at start with worn/loose guides? Becaus=
e
when the engine is cooling off, the oil in the rockerbox seeps back up th=

valve stem and collects in the combustion chamber.
Just like the GM engines with bad valve *seals*, although on a VW, it mea=

the guide and a head pull. On a GM it means a set of rubber valve seals.
