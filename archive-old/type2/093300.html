Subject: Re: [T2] Why is it Knocking ?

Sounds like a lifter and I would consider pulling them and cleaning them.
Also I would consider readjusting them. The archives have the updated 
procedure and it is also a big deal on the Vanagon list and Boston Bob's 
website.

:
&gt;Hello Everyone..  This is kind of long.. I have a 78 Westy ..Only gets 
&gt;driven on weekends , and not everyone. I drove it back from Santa Cruz to 
&gt;Santa Rosa and parked it for two weeks .. started it up and it was making 
&gt;a ticking/ knocking noise. Turned it off and researched the list and 
&gt;decided that it was a lifter. Changed the oil to a lighter grade and ran 
&gt;it for 20 minutes and it stopped making a noise. Drove it for a week ,no 
&gt;noise,  parked it on a hill side ways for 9 hours , got in, started it and 
&gt;it started knocking really loud. drove it 2 miles to my brothers house and 
&gt;then towed it home. started it up and drove in the garage.. Where it sits. 
&gt;.Started it again , pulled each plug wire and it still made noise...Still 
&gt;thinking it's a lifter.. pulled valve covers, pushed in the rocker arm 
&gt;where it attaches to push rod.. all cylinders where hard except #4 .. I 
&gt;can push in the push rod , on the intact and exhaust side. The question I 
&gt;have is...Is this a soft lifter and will it make that kind of noise .. 
&gt;Should I be checking other things....I really keep the maintenance up on 
&gt;the Westy, never over heat it    Thanks in advance...
