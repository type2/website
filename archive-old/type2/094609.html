Subject:  Is there a EZ way to clean the tank?

------=_NextPart_001_0004_01C2470F.5A4D1D80

(Second time, without the tag line...sorry about that!)
Hello!

My 1978 Bus, which Limped Home the other night (clogged fuel line; replac=
ed that; the filter is new and the tank has been drained once about five =
days ago...) started to limp again, which means that I have to clean the =
tank, I suppose...which I understand means having to remove the engine an=
d then take the tank out...(sigh) So I have to ask: Is there another way =
to clean the tank with out doing that? Like a MIRCLE cleaner that you put=
 in, wash out, I don't know. I guess I am not looking forward to the task=
 of taking the tank out to clean it...
