Subject: Stock offset (was Fwd:  Re: merc wheels)

Hi,

Me&gt; I'm still looking for confirmation of the stock wheel's offset, BTW.
Me&gt; My Haynes manual says 41mm, but Brian Verbeek says 39mm.

Sami&gt; Volkswagen's Type 2 Repair Manual for '74-'78 says 39mm for the 
Sami&gt; 5 1/2 J x 14 steelwheel.

 Oh damn! I guess I'd better measure them then. If it's true then I
need 5mm spacers instead of 3mm ones...

 Thanks for the info.

Cheers,
	W.
