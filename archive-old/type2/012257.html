Subject: hot start relay dying?
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

hey volks,
now that lizzy is back on the road and i have been
driving it around i have encountered an intermitten
starting problem.   it was starting fine, no problems
when one evening last week it just wouldnt start.  it
had started just minutes before no problem.  at the
time it was in a heated garage, not warmed up and
nothing.  there was power going into the hot start
relay but none coming out of it.  arced a couple wires
and got it started and when i got home, again,
nothing.  i had an extra relay so i put it in and it
started right up.  figured the relay had gone bad,
problem solved.  well it happened again this morning. 
except that it is blizzard conditions out, i was
parked uphill in a driveway and ended up having to
jumpstart it backwards rolling into the street, what a
fun time!  anyways does anyone have any insight as to
why this would be happening, the connections look
good, although i will go over them again.  any help or
ideas would be great.  have a happy holidays everyone.
