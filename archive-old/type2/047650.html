Subject: Re: [T2] (reply to) Trying to do my rear brakes and need help!

[...]

If you know who tightened those lug nuts last time [perhaps when you bought
some new tires?], take the bus back to them.  Insist that they remove the
lug nuts with their own equipment, and do a thorough inspection of the
studs, drums, wheels, etc. for damage.  If they break their &quot;professional&quot;
tools in the process, so be it.

If you are satisfied that there's no damage due to their incompetence, have
them reinstall the wheels and lug nuts using a torque wrench, tightened to
the VW specification for your vehicle.  [A REAL torque wrench does not have
a hose connected to it, it is operated only by muscle power.]

If they are idiotic enough to try and charge you for this &quot;service&quot;, suggest
that your bill to them for your lost time and inconvenience will be at least
5 times whatever they ask plus attorney's fees.

FWIW.....
