Subject: Exhaust smell in my heat, Please help
Date: Fri, 6 Nov 1998 08:13:30 -0500 

Hi Everyone,
     My bus: 1972 Bus, 1700 engine with dual Dellorto carbs.
     You know when winter is near because of the increase in heat related
posts.  I am at a loss, and need some advice and insight from others.
     Anyway, I was one of the lucky ones that got new heat exchangers from
the VW program last year.  When they were installed, my heat output was
&quot;normal&quot;.  Now that winter is near, and I am using the heater, I get an
exhaust smell in the bus.  I don't think that the heat exchangers are
leaking, but how would I check without pulling the exhaust system off?  I
have the stock blower fan in the engine compartment, and I installed an
Attwood bilge blower fan in line with the main heat tube.  Both fans work
fine.  The foam seal in the engine compartment is in good shape.  All the
heat system components are in place (all that I know of).
     I don't understand how the exhaust smell is getting into the bus.  If
the heat exchangers are leaking, would that cause a noticeable engine
popping when decelerating under load (going down hill in gear)?  I don't
have any popping/backfiring noise.  I know that when the exhaust header got
loose (in the past), I got the popping.  I don't know what else to check.
     I think the bus is running rich, could that be causing an excess of
exhaust fumes?  If so, then how are they getting into the bus?

Any and all advice, suggestions are appreciated.
Please reply to this address and the my HOME address:  vwstuart_at_webtv_dot_net

Thanks,
Stuart Neil
