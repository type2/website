Subject: RE: [T2] Re:Valve and Rod job... I think.

Please, someone hold me back!

It's so easy even a girl can do it. Wow! I should forward this to my
girlfriend.

What is this about $150 for all the books and tools you'll ever need. First
don't waist $60.00 of your precious $150.00 on the 3 (most important) basic
test tools - &quot;multimeter ($15), dwell meter ($20), a timing light ($25)&quot;.
This after the Bentley manual ($34.95) leaves you $55.05 before tax for hmmm
maybe a cheap set of sockets.

Please don't set this guy off on the wrong track. A decent set of basic
tools to attempt this sort of job is more along the bal park of $500-$700.
That's Craftsman too.

A couple hours to pull the motor and slap it back? I would love to see that
done by a first timer or even a pro for that matter. Yes that is what we
charge for a labor rate to pull and reinstall but it always takes way
longer. A beginner needs to set aside a whole day and a helping hand for
each of the tasks. Aside from problems that is.


 &quot;Hang in there. You can do it. We're here for you.&quot;............. Do you
work for Checker?

&gt; Buy the books and some tools and start learning. For $150 you could have
&gt; every book and tool you need to do ANYTHING to the bus short of
&gt; rebuilding
&gt; the tranny.
&gt;
&gt; You've got a resource that most of us &quot;older&quot; shade tree mechanics never
&gt; had - this list. &lt;grin&gt;
&gt;
&gt; It takes a couple hours to pull the engine, couple to put it back
&gt; in. Give
&gt; YOU the opportunity to fix alot of stuff along the way that MUST be done
&gt; like replacing the fuel lines.
&gt;
&gt; It would take me DAYS to work and save up the money it would take to pay
&gt; off a $450 mechanic bill. That means to me that I have DAYS to get the
&gt; motor out and diagnose it before I break even.
&gt;
&gt; In short his time is more expensive than my time.
&gt;
&gt; Someone mentioned one time that the VW was designed so a teenager could
&gt; repair it any place in the world. Takes very simple tools, basic
&gt; knowledge,
&gt; and 3 basic test tools - multimeter ($15), dwell meter ($20), and
&gt; a timing
&gt; light ($25).
&gt;
&gt; Don't waste your money paying them, learn how to do this work (not hard)
&gt; and you will have a skill available to bail yourself out anytime your
&gt; antique VW gives you a fit.
&gt;
&gt; When I hurt my hand a few years ago (almost lost two fingers -
&gt; not related
&gt; to my VW projects) my wife completed the rebuild on our '78 Westy 2.0 FI
&gt; engine. She did a great job and now years later the engine is still great.
&gt;
&gt; Hang in there. You can do it. We're here for you.
