Subject: ROOF RACK CLAMPS

So I found a roof rack but im not sure it is from a bus - i was told it
came off of a 70's bus and it fits nicely on my 60?

Anyway, it appears as tho im missing some sort of clamps - does anyone
have any pics of what these things look like - ive seen roof racks in
pics that look very much like mine - but - anyway - info as to clamps
and roof racks would be appreciated
