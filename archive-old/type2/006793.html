Subject:      1st report 82 Westy maint

To All

The Westy is in my retired VW mech's shop. We had ordered basic tune up
parts and the push rod tube seals, of course.

Started this morning with the rear bearnings and CV's. Wheels seemed
tight before removal. 1st problem: left outer bearing very bad, axel
actually wobbled in bearing, on order. Right outer CV boot split at
shell, on order. Right outer grease seal bad, on order. Parts so far are
not available locally, must UPS from OKC. Pulled PR tubes, cleaned and
installed properly (retaining spring on left was in wrong, but no damage
to pushrods.) Lower tin and valve covers soaking.
Parts due 10 AM. Installand get wheels bak on then all filters and
tuneup.

Only good news, brakes hardly warn, no leaks or greese on shoes. needs
flush, bleed and adjust.

All for today

Bill
