Subject: [T2] Suggestion for removing broken cylinder stud


Well the stud broke, but not the way I
&gt; expected. It twisted off right above the threads.
&gt; 
&gt; Any suggestion on a removal procedure I can do at home? Or is it off to
&gt; the machine shop for some heat treatment and careful drilling/tapping. I
&gt; thought I might use some liquid nitrogen to cool down the case to make
&gt; the threads looser. Think this will work?

I hope this wasn't the nice case 
your photos showed earlier this week.
You can fool around with hot/cold all day, or:

Mig a nut on the broken stud, it becomes...
( walla:) a bolt. Sound simple? It's not.
Penetrate the weld deep into the base of the nut.
Add penetrating fluid while the stud cools.
Expansion / contraction breaks the rust grip.
Repeat as often as necessary, you will
twist these nuts off until you get it.
Even with no stud protruding, you can still
send mig down the hole, and build it up
until a nut goes on it. You may have to do it
15 times to get it, but you will have mastered
this technique for future repairs. Or not :)
