Subject: FI woes...??
Message-Id: &lt;3.0.5.32.19990601130306.00aa4b70_at_mail.bhm.bellsouth_dot_net&gt;

My FI '79 2.0 FI had was not wanting to idle when cold.
I would have to rev the engine a little for a minute
or so to warm it up, then it would idle. Then after driving
for a little while the idle rpm would increase. I had been
meaning to figure out what the problem was... but hadnt
gotten to it....

well, yesterday I was attempting to finish the oil gauge and
&quot;hotstart relay&quot; installation.  I go to crank the bus and
it will not start.  Almost does... but won't...

&gt;from reading the list/archives I  had suspected the Head Temp
Sensor II, with the earlier idle problem, so I check it first...
i loosened it and tightened it to see make sure it was tight.
go back and try to start it up. it fires right up, but i had
to give it gas to keep it running. I shut it off and go back
to check again and realize I had forgotten to reconnect the
HeadTempSensor to the FI harness... reconnect and try it again.
just like before... no start...

i've double and triple checked all the vacuum hoses.
complete tuneup w/ points/cond/rotor/cap/plugs/wires last week.

i'm planning to borrow a friends multimeter and try to figure
out how to do the (ohm?) testing on the FI....
never used a multimeter, should be interesting...

any advice, suggestions, thoughts are welcomed and appreciated!

thanks-
Rob

ps. wrt 914 sump plate and dipstick being too long..
once you guys pointed it out to me... it was obvious that
cutting an inch off the diptick was the easy solution.
why wasnt it obvious before..... ;)
