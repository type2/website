&gt;There is no rotor turning procedure
&gt;advised or given. You guys and gals check your Bently Official VW
&gt;manuals and find the pages that describe the procedure for the
&gt;tuning of rotors. Take all day if you like.

These are good articles, keep it coming, and thank you. =^ )

However, the Bentley procedure for turning brake rotors is delineated in
Section 8.7.7 of the bay-window manual. It gives specs for minimum
thickness and maximum runout.
