Dear Folks,

I've checked into this show and it's going to be wonderful! For more info
you can go to the Michigan Vintage Volkswagen Club's webpage at
http://www.vvwca.mvvc/show2000.htm . It sounds like great fun. Gus Bus and I
will be going and John Hartranft and I hope to have the Sacred Hubcap and
Tour Box there too before it starts it's trip around the Midwest. Hope to
see many of you there!

Chris and Gus in Atlanta
