&gt; &gt; Anyone out there have an accurate wiring diagram for a mid-'70's
&gt; Westfalia?
&gt; What I really mean is a diagram specifically for the Westfalia equipment! 

I have the scanned supplement to the VW shop manual for the late Westy, be happy to send it to you, but it's a pretty big file. Just the wiring wouldn't be too bad, 200-300K.

I am trying to reformat it right now so it can be posted to the document website.
