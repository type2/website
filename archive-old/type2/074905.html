Subject: Re: [T2] auxiliary air regulator help

cause a rich mixture...... That symptom is elusive, it could be any
number of things so start with visual inspection (like you've been doing)
on the entire fuel, vacuum, ignition system. I've seen rich from a leaky
fuel regulator vacuum line.

&gt; Well, the regulator was blocked when the engine was cold and needed 
&gt; a
&gt; little coaxing to get it to open.  I will definaty clean and lube 
&gt; it.
&gt; 
&gt; Let me know if I'm wrong, but if I had a vacuum leak, wouldn't the
&gt; engine idle higher because the additional air allowed into the
&gt; manifold?  Instead, when then engine's cold, the idle is low.
&gt; 
&gt; However, that doesn't bar the fact that there still might be vacuum 
&gt; leak
&gt; during all times causing an overall increase in rpms..  But that
&gt; wouldn't cause a rich mixture, like I'm having...

&gt; &gt; I'm ready for the incoming flack on this one.
&gt; &gt; I just spray mine down with rust remover, Liquid Wrench or some 
&gt; such.
&gt; &gt; Most times I just find vacuum leaks are the problem not hardware.
&gt; &gt; Yes your pictures look right, the notch is a bleeder so it lets a 
&gt; little
&gt; &gt; air pass all the time.

&gt; &gt; &gt; So, I was wondering why my idle was low at startup, and I 
&gt; probably
&gt; &gt; &gt; should have checked the regulator way back when..
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I tried blowing through it and it didn't let anything through, 
&gt; even
&gt; &gt; &gt; though the engine was cold.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; So, I took it off and took it apart and got the little flap 
&gt; moving
&gt; &gt; &gt; descently.  I'd like to take it apart and regrease it, but it 
&gt; looks
&gt; &gt; &gt; like
&gt; &gt; &gt; it's pressed shut, so there isn't much I can do.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; One thing I'm trying to figure out is if the opening is wide 
&gt; enough.
&gt; &gt; &gt;  I
&gt; &gt; &gt; took two pictures:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; This pic with the smaller opening is how it is when the 
&gt; metallic
&gt; &gt; &gt; strip
&gt; &gt; &gt; is holding the flap open.
&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.csulb_dot_edu/~msoultan/slightly-open.jpg
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; This pic with the bigger opening is me holding it even wider 
&gt; with a
&gt; &gt; &gt; screwdriver.
&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.csulb_dot_edu/~msoultan/open.jpg
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Does it need to open as much as it is in the second pic, or is 
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; first
&gt; &gt; &gt; opening ok?  Does someone have a cold one that they can compare 
&gt; to?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Mike
