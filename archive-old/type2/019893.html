I too work in the environmental field and agree wholeheartedly. It is
amazing the sources we find of some tri-methyl-ethyl-death chemical when
it pops up doing routine water sampling. 

One suggestion: Contact your local environmental governing body (Natural
Resources, Environmental Protection, etc.) and ask about amnesty days or
local household hazardous waste disposals.  Even in podunk Mississippi
we manage to have them in every county once a year and twice in somewhat
populous areas. They will accept ANY material from paint to
anti-freeze(what's that?) to solvents.  The phone # can usually be found
in the Blue pages of the phone book. They also should have info on local
recycling efforts for oil, batteries, etc.  Generally, these folks are
in a non-regulatory/outreach program and are not out to incriminate
anyone.

Thank you for your attention.  We now return to our regularly scheduled
programming.
