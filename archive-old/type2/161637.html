Subject: bonnaroo 06

Any listees heading to Bonnaroo this year?

A group of us are meeting at the Wally World in Manchester wicked early
Thursday morning and are going in together. We don't have a specific time -
maybe 5am or so? Just a few of us on the samba boards are going to try and
meet up.

Wal-Mart Supercenter 2518 Hillsboro Blvd Manchester, TN 37355 (931) 728-6000

Anyone want to join? I'm in Nashville and could meet up with anyone driving
through.
