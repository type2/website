&gt; 
&gt; Im in Montreal (Canada), i think Grand Canyon its too hot... then my
&gt; american dream should be to go to california ..LA and spend few days on
&gt; beach... of course id like to see any VW around .  Any suggestion  ...should
&gt; i take the &quot;route 66&quot; ..  is it too hot in desert for a aircooled... id like
&gt; to stay at least camping 1 night in the desert

Aircooleds were _made_ for the desert! :)  If your cooling system is in
good shape and you exercise reasonable patience the hottest temperatures
shouldn't bother you.  Ask the folks in Lake Havasu.  (&quot;Havasu&quot; is an
Indian word meaning &quot;It's too danged hot here, let's move to Flagstaff!&quot;
:)

Route 66 is fun to retrace, but some of it is the hottest road in the
country.

You might also consider US 50 across Nevada, dubbed &quot;the lonliest road&quot;.
Beautiful desert scenery interrupted with pinion pine mountains.  The
beauty of this route is that the valleys are at 6000 feet, meaning that
the passes aren't much above the valleys.  The high country is relatively
cool in summer.  Lots of fun in a bus.
