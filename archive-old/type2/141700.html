Subject: Re: [T2] fan housing

The biggest problem is the heat exchangers they wont allow the fan to come 
out far enough past the studs with out bending the heck out of them (hack 
job).

I have never done this. I pull the engine. Seems like a lot of work but hey 
the bus probably needs it, being 32 years old. Trans, and engine main, 
clutch can all be looked at as well.

Don't forget the oil cooler bracket that mounts to the fan housing. Inspect 
the crank pulley hub these are a big cause of major engine problems. The 
crank can get scarfed and constantly throw hubs, remedy... new crank Ouch. 
Oh and good time to replace that cracked dried out dipstick boot (cheap 
part).

Subject: [T2] fan housing


&gt;I am trying to take the fan housing of my 73 van.  I suspect the oil
&gt; cooler or seals are leaking.  The Bentley manual seems a little sparse
&gt; on information.  I should be able to remove the for bolts and it slides
&gt; out with the alternator attached.  I checked the archives and applied a
&gt; little common sense.  It is loose but just won't slide completely off
&gt; the studs.  I removed the alternator adjustment arm from the heat
&gt; exchanger.  From what the archives say I should also remove the oil fill
&gt; tube.
&gt;
&gt; Do you have to drain the oil to remove the oil fill tube?
&gt; Do I have to remove the heat exchangers as well?
&gt;
&gt; The manual also suggest separating the housing.  Does this make it
&gt; easier and is it worth wrestling with the bolts?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for any advice!
