Never mind, had it fixed before breakfast. The little bolt on the front of
the input shaft, the one that goes through the coupling and acts as a
set-screw--it had fallen slap out. Scrounged a 13mm bolt, tightened it up,
greased some dry bits, and I'm back on the road.

What I can't figure out was how I was able to shift into 3rd, 4th, and
reverse last night. This morning the shift rod was completely disconnected
from the input shaft, I should have been stuck in one gear. Oh well.

Meanwhile the stupid Honda requires a fuel pump relay from the dealer. I
expect this to cost at least $900.
