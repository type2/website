It depends on what you are doing with your engine. If you are building it up
for higher performance and use a performance ignition coil, the bosch sparks
may produce a slightly hotter spark. I believe my 71 original manual
reccomends bosch spark plugs, never hurts to go with the reccomendation.

&gt;Also, has anyone had a plug blow out (physically ejected) from the socket?
&gt;Just wondering if its common and what damage might occur.  All seems well,
&gt;but a little scary.  Thanks.
