&gt;  The first time I would drive the bus on a given day, she would

&gt; Yesterday it started happening each time I brake.

My bus had similar problems and the fix was as simple as replacing the front
pads and adjusting the rear brakes.

&gt; I'm
&gt; a little afraid to let my first repair job ever be to the things that make
&gt; the bus keep from running into something; especially since I generally have
&gt; my two year old son with me. My questions are 1, should I attempt this?

Whenever I run into a strange brake problem, I replace everything that looks old
or worn.  The brake system is pretty easy to understand, but it is a very
critical system.  I feel confident in my brake repair skills, but if I had any
doubts about my ability, this is one area I would leave to the experts.  A
failure here could affect a lot of lives.

&gt; 3, If I get into the system, attempt
&gt; the repairs, and get the brakes bled and holding pressure, am I  O.K. then or
&gt; is it possible that I could have forgotten something or done something that
&gt; could cause them to fail later?

If you reassemble everything properly, and the system isn't leaking any fluid,
you should be ok.  Triple check your work before getting on the road and read
through the brake section in both the Muir and the Bentley to learn all you can.

&gt; I also need to know what &quot;power brakes means&quot;?

If you have a big (approximately 12 inch round 6 inch deep metal cylinder
attached to the master cylinder, then you have power brakes.
