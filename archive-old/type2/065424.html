did you get the metal roof or just the poptop?

the sunroof buses have the inside skin reinforcemnet of the sambas, like the
inside half of the skylight windows.   Common sense implies this as a useful
reinforcemt.

measure carefully anddon't forget yr subfloors.

BTW, Mike &amp; I are going to sometime this winter transfer a roof from a rusted
out 63 samba  (the sunroof was left open for ten years) onto a 59 walkthrough
hardtop deluxe, and add subfloors, to create a 59 walkthrough samba.
  Updates when it actually happens and then I can speak from experience on
the process.
