Joe and All-

[LOL] Thanks-thought I was the only person who had this watch!!!!;-)


Serioulsy, though... torquing the flywheel nut on an upright is much
the same. Can't do it right, so how much is enough?

My former mechanic (who was pushing 300# on a good day) recommended a
6' cheater bar and &quot;throwing&quot; his weight into it. Not very scientific,
but it worked;-)

I did it using myself (195#) on the torque-wrench and my wife (120#)
holding the motor in place!!! Hey, it worked....hasn't come loose yet!

&gt; I use an impact siezmographer chronographic quartz watch. $14.59 at
Radio Shack. You just set it to impact mode and it tells how many
ft-lbs of hammering you're doing. Carpenters use them all the time to
make workmen-compensation cases for carpal tunnel syndrome. Kinda hard
to get 235 ft/lbs out of it, but I just imagine I'm hammering on the
PO...really improves my strength AND stamina. ;)
&gt; 
&gt; Seriously, if you have to be precise, you have to use a torque
wrench or a socket and longbar and math (see Muir)...but you can't get
it exactly right and line it up with those holes anyway. I've always
just gone as far as I could and then I back off enough to get a solid
pin in it...then I check from time to time.

&gt; &gt;My question is, how do you know how to re-torque the sucker when
you are 
&gt; &gt;putting it back on?  Hammering the h*ll out of it doesn't show up
in any 
&gt; &gt;of my manuals as a torque setting.
