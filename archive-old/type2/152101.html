&gt; I opened one of those ECU and was wondering if somebody knew what is the part
&gt; number for those Operational Amplifier (?) under radiator?

why this particular part??? is it obviously bad???   did it damage other
any other parts??

heck why do you even think the ECU is bad.

&gt; I found 3 schematics pics but no part number.... :-(

exactly as VW designed it.....you need to go to a VW authorized service
center for the part number, where upon they will sell you a new ECU for
$500 (which they got from Bus Depot for $123??)
