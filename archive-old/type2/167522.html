&gt; Bob, are these LED taillights something you made
&gt; yourself with proprietary circuit boards, something
&gt; you purchased and adapted, modules you purchased and
&gt; mounted to fit, or LED replacement bulbs?

something I purchased and adapted.

&gt; Do yours have all the LEDs on all the time with two
&gt; different resistance values for bright and normal or
&gt; two different intensities of LEDs?

I have two banks of LED's one set is on for tail lights the second set
comes on for brake lights.  haven't bothered with back up or turn signals
(yet)

&gt; I'm about to replace all my interior lighting with
&gt; LEDs and have been experimenting with light output
&gt; intensity and spread. I will likely be combining

I used one of those &quot;Head lamp&quot; LED lights from a camping store inside
down at EVerybus and it put out quite a bit of light from the 4 white
LED's

&gt; approx. 120 degree spread for general lighting with 5
&gt; to 8 degree spread for reading lights. I, too have to
&gt; get the engine back in and bus on road before much
&gt; more lighting exprimentation!
&gt;
&gt; After the interiors, I will likely make boards for
&gt; taillights, marker lights and turn signals. I'm
&gt; considering something really trick with that symbol we
&gt; aren't supposed to use - I wonder if I can stay out of
&gt; trouble with VW if I give them away and charge a ton
&gt; for &quot;shipping and handling?&quot; I s'pose I need to drop
&gt; that idea! Too many other things above it in priority
&gt; right now. -BaH

well have done the photos etc, so just need to put the write up together,
I had em displayed down at Everybus, turned out to be very simple, once I
figured it out.

good luck

Bob
