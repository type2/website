Thanks alot.  That really means alot to us female enthusiasts, I'm sure.  
You're garage partner is a very lucky woman.  We need more encouragement from 
the male population!!!!!

I'll keep you posted as I get things together for myself and Consuela.  I am 
so very anxious to get her running again.  She's sitting out in the parking 
lot (very large one) all by herself with the top up, just strutting her stuff 
  (LOL).
