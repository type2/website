Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel sensor accessability

Andrew,
I also live about 12 miles from town, and I have the same model fuel guage:
reads well when tank is full but after 30 miles it reads empty. I am waiting
to fix it until I have to remove the engine anyway. In the mean time, I have
a post-it note on the dash on which I write down the mileage for the next
fill-up. To be on the safe side, I fill after 150 miles (250km?) even though
I get more miles than that out of a tank of gas. Just yesterday I filled up
after pushing the mileage limits a bit. The book says that the tank holds
14.8 gallons but the fuel pump registered 14.9! I guess I cut that one a
little close.

Anyway, just set yourself a reasonable mileage range between fill-ups and
fix the sender when you have the engine out for other work.

&gt; Hi guys,
&gt; The fuel guage on my 77 9-seater Microbus is pretty
&gt; unreliable.
&gt; When you fill up the tank it's fine &amp; reads well down
&gt; to about half way.
&gt; Then the gremlin gets in the works and it goes on and
&gt; off like a yo-yo!
&gt; I took it to the auto-electricians yesterday and they
&gt; said they think it's the sender after examining the
&gt; guage.
&gt; Problem is, apparently the only way to reach the
&gt; sensor is either to cut through the floor or to remove
&gt; the engine, and to be honest, I'd rather avoid both
&gt; methods if at all possible.
&gt; I have nowhere to lay under the car at home &amp; so I
&gt; really can't do the work myself.
&gt; Will the engine have to be removed to get at it or is
&gt; there a tricky way to do it without such a major
&gt; manouvre?
&gt; If not, should I just wait until I get the clutch
&gt; replaced(probably later this year) &amp; have it repaired
&gt; then?
&gt; The problem about the fuel guage is that I live in the
&gt; country 20kms(12 miles) outside of town &amp; each run in
&gt; &amp; out uses a visible amount of fuel........I really
&gt; can't afford to not know how much is there.
&gt; Any clue would be a help.....
&gt; :-)
&gt; Cheers
