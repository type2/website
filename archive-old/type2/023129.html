Subject: flapper boxes...correct me if i'm wrong
Mime-Version: 1.0

so, my heater cables came from the busdepot yesterday (along with a whole 
bunch of other goodies.)  i removed one of my flapper boxes, because the 
lever arm was bent and i couldn't deal with it under the bus.  the other 
one (well, that one is rusted on) appeared to be in working condition, so i 
let it be.  the cables were all disconnected before i got to them, so i'm 
unsure as to what exactly i am looking at.

this is where my question begins.  the lever on the flapper is at a 90 
degree angle with the ground (resting position.)  when the lever is pulled 
toward the front of the vehicle, the flapper opens and spills heat to the 
tubes leading to the front of the bus.  on the end of the lever arm is a 
hinged piece of metal where the heater cable is connected.  when the cables 
are installed, the cables should be taut on the &quot;heat off&quot; position on the 
dash, but not opening the flapper.  in order for this to occur, the hinged 
metal connection on the lever, must be parallel to the ground and pointing 
toward the front of the bus (perp. to the lever.)---???

the reason i ask...on the passenger side, the hinge piece is resting 
towards the rear of the vehicle.  i tried to rotate it toward the front of 
the vehicle, but....there is a large bundle of wires sheathed together...in 
the way, that just won't budge (without being disconnected.)

also, what is a good way to minimize the &quot;squeaking&quot; coming from the 
exhaust/heat exchanger assembly?  (since i'm already back there, knee deep 
in it!)

thanks in advance

freezingly yours
