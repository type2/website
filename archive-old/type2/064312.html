Did the same thing in my 911 one time: pulled out in the street,
jumped on the gas (which actually _does_ something in a 911,
then WHAM! and I lost all oomph.  CV joint broke the one bolt left
holding it on, and came loose, smashing a brand new SSI Stainless
Steel heat exchanger (~ $500 - why don;t they make those for VW's?)
