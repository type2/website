Subject: Re: [T2] AC Delco Alternator

Well I have to aggree with bill on the delco...the space in
a T-IV engine is designed for teh speficic bosch alternator
and sadly even other bosche ones are often a hard fit not
to mention other brands...I did end up using a higher
amperage one from a volvo? for the '80 westy, but the '78
alternator is different...next time, I will be looking into
haveing the spare alternator re-built to higher spec if
possible...what is teh output stock?(can't recall..) I
think a competant alternator shop should be able to easilly
bump it up at least twenty amps with not too much effort. I
will be looking into this later as I want to re-work teh
battery system to include two batteries for the camping
needs so the fridge can be used longer without running the
bus.

'78 westy about to finally run again...
