Subject: Re: [VB] Bus Resource List and Weekly Stats


Matt Roberds sez:

&gt;Another thing that will probably happen if the sites are more
&gt;well-known is that you and Thom will get lots more direct email
&gt;asking VW questions.  (Maybe you get a lot now - I don't know).
&gt;I would say to just forward them to the list, but you may have
&gt;other ideas.  :)

Those are welcome, and I think I can speak for Thom here as well. I get two
or three a month, he probably gets more. Thom probably answers his and gets
them right the first time. I forward mine to the list. =^ )

&gt;Meta tags yes, spiders...I dunno.  I'd say to let them in to the
&gt;first level or two, like the main pages and one level down.  If
&gt;you let the spiders into the Library and Archive pages, everyone
&gt;who has a valid email address on their contribution will get
&gt;more spam.

It seems there are several ways to deal with the problem of web address
harvesting. You mention converting the addresses to .gif files which I've
never heard of before. There's also:

--A wpoison script. This is a script that generates an infinite number of
bogus email addresses. You can't get to the real addresses until you get
past this. It's not visible but you can play with it here:

	http://www.type2_dot_com/cgi-local/threebagsfull.pl

--Javascript obfuscation. This is endorsed by no less than Steve Linford of
Spamhaus Project fame, who claims it has not failed him since 1997 when he
started using it. For the address &lt;support_at_uxn_dot_com&gt;:

	&lt;script language=&quot;JavaScript1.2&quot;&gt;&lt;!--
	//Anti-spam address builder
	var user   = &quot;support&quot;
	var domain = &quot;uxn&quot;
	var tld    = &quot;com&quot;
	document.write(&quot;&lt;a href=&quot; + &quot;mail&quot; + &quot;to:&quot; + user + &quot;_at_&quot; +
	domain + &quot;.&quot; + tld + &quot;&gt;&quot; + user + &quot;_at_&quot; + domain + &quot;.&quot; + tld + &quot;&lt;/a&gt;&quot;)
	// --&gt;
	&lt;/script&gt;

--Hexadecimal obfuscation. This is when you encode the addresses in hex,
which can easily be done with resources such as
http://www.paradigm.nu/ascii2hex/ascii2hex.htm

	In hex, the address &lt;address_at_bus_dot_com&gt; is
	%61%64%64%72%65%73%73%40%62%75%73%2E%63%6F%6D

This will be handled seamlessly by a browser but it is useless in ASCII and
it has no atsign so a trawler won't see it. Long and short, spammers won't
be able to deal with it.

I considered scrabbling desperately for bus content but it's just not
happening, I will have to take my chances with the administrators. Happy
new year everybody!!!
