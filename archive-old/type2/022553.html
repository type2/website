Subject: RE: [T2] dual stock solexs and Muir's suggestions 

[...]

Forget about Muir.  Go with the stock configuration.  I've never had
any problems with the cut-off valves.  Choke always worked when
adjusted.  The only problem I ever had with a choke was on my 67
Beetle where the pin that stopped the choke was underdesigned and
would bend causing the choke to jam.  WV fixed this problem with the
34.  Muir is a confidence builder not a repair manual.  Follow the
Bently.  My gut feeling is that Muir new very little about the Type
IV engine and fuel injection.  The early editions of Muir didn't
include the Type IV because the Type IV didn't exist when it was
written.  My impression is that the Type IV stuff was added by others
to keep the book selling.  But that's just my opinion.  I could be
wrong.

&gt;Hello List,
&gt;
&gt;The archives re down so I hope you don't mind if I ask
&gt;a common question. I have a set of dualstock solex 34
&gt;PDSIT-2/-3 carbs on my 73 bus that is missing one of
&gt;its 3 electromagnetic cuttoff switches. The left carb
&gt;has the central idling system's electromagnetic cut
&gt;off valve (the larger one with the large obvious
&gt;stopper), but is missing its electromagnetic idling
&gt;cut off valve (the smaller one with no protruding
&gt;stopper). The right carburator has its electromagnetic
&gt;idling cut off valve (the smaller one). I am getting a
&gt;replacement cuttoff valve for the one that is missing
&gt;Thursday. 
&gt;
&gt;&lt;QUESTION&gt;
&gt;
&gt;should I do what Muir says and make these valves into
&gt;plugs by cutting off the ends of the valves or just
&gt;leave them stock if they work? I know that Muir didn't
&gt;like them. He also suggested disabling the choke
&gt;except in the winter. What do you think about that?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for any answers given!
&gt;
