Subject: RE:  Jalouse windows
Date: Mon, 22 Feb 1999 15:13:59 -0600

&gt;What is the story on these windows and the frames?  Anybody know 
&gt;their history?  Obviously a French name.  Yet used for westfalias in 
&gt;built in Germany.  I know in Florida a great deal of the older homes 

Not being multi or bi-lingual (hell, I'm still struggling with my native
tongue, Americanized English), I always assumed Jalousie meant Louvered in
German.  I gained this assumption from my &quot;VW-Campingmobile 67&quot; manual that
obviously was written for the 1968 model since it clearly shows a loaf bus
on the cover and subsequent pages.  

Anyway, the manual is written in both English and German and on page 7 it
says in English, &quot;The Campmobile 67 is equipped with two louvered
windows...&quot; and just under it in German it says, &quot;Das Campmobile 67 ist mit
zwei Jalousie-Fenstern versehen...&quot;.  Thus my assumption.  Any
German-speaking busers (B.S. ers?) out there who know?
