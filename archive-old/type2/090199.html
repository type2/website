Subject: locked rear wheels

Hi folks!

I parked my 77 Westy in my garage last night and today
I tried to back out and found the rear wheels to be
locked tight. I have had one wheel sort of lock
sometimes when wet, but usually it releases as soon as
I step on the gas. It seems even if the E Brake
somehow locked up I could still get some motion. I
crawled underneath and had my wife release the E Brake
and I can hear the cable moving in the tube. I put it
in gear and hit the throtle and the clutch started
burning.
The rear brakes were at 40% a month ago, the transaxle
is a recent rebuild, and the CV's were done in the
last year.

Any ideas on what the heck is going on?
