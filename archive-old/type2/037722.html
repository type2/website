Subject: RE: Importing VW Van into Canada

A friend of mine from Vancouver BC would regularly come visit me in the
states and buy vehicles (back when the CA dollar was doing a bit better).
There was always a duty that he had to pay at the border for the vehicle,
but he always was driving them back in.  The duty was based on the sale
amount of the vehicle.  Once that was done he went and did the normal
license and tax stuff to get the plates and then he had the vehicle, which
he would sell and do the whole thing again.  I would always ask him how it
went and he never had any horror stories.  His only complaint seemed to be
that every time he would have to go into the office at the border and that
takes time.  And one time he ended up waiting in line three hours just to
get to the office and once inside it wasn't much better.  You will know your
border crossing and when are good and bad times to try and get through.

Take this for what little it offers.

Hi Volks,

I'm bringing back a FREE 1979 VW van from NH to Ontario this weekend, and
was wondering what will happen when I hit the border.  What sort of
duties/taxes/surcharges are applicable, and what kind of  $$$/credit is
applicable?

I'm towing the van back on a dolly, as the van has no transmission and will
probably be imported as parts, rather than as a vehicle. It will also
contain some westy cabinetry I'm bringing back for another listmember.

Pro's, con's,  suggestions and horror stories welcome. The more info I get,
the fewer surprises there will be on the way home.

Thanks,

Greg Potts,
