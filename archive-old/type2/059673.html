 &gt; Now my question: the nose is painted black. Is this a black primer, or do
 &gt; need to primer over it? &gt;&gt;
It's basically a wash primer, it protects the part from humidity while it's
sitting in warehouses and being shipped.  Just rough the surface with a Scotch
Brite pad and shoot a good primer surfacer on it after  you've installed your
nose.  You might also invest in some weld thru primer for all you welds.  The
industry is somewhat split on this stuff because of cost (about 20 bucks a
can) but if your gonna drive your bus forever, sound-rust free welds are a
comforting thought 20 years from now.
