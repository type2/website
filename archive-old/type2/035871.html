                   ...next time around try U.S. Chemical and Plastics 
All-Metal body filler.
Unlike the Bondo clones, when dry the filler doesn't absorb water leading to 
re-rusting
of the damaged area (we only wanna do this once, right?) Available at a good 
body shop
supply house (The Eastwood Company sells a similar product, but at a higher 
price).
Recommended to me by a body man (whose first recommendation was to learn to 
work
lead and beeswax), as a close second.
