Subject: Re: [T2] fixing value tube leaks

Doh.. I just went and picked some of the permatex up..

Well, let me give this a try this weekend and see how it works.  If it 
leaks, I will definitely remember the loctite and give that a try the 
next time!

Thanks!
Mike

&gt; Loctite 565 works better. Put a very thin coating on the tube, install the
&gt; o-ring, then another very thin coating of the 565. I use a paint brush to
&gt; apply it. They never leak. 565 is very flexible so it moves with the engine
&gt; parts.
