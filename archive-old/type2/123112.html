&gt;   We're here holed up and roughing it at the Embassy Suites just above
&gt; Baltimore, MD.  We had an itinerary change that took us to Maryland, so

Welcome to B'more.

&gt; far the drive has been one long easy uphill grade from S.C.  We've been
&gt; speeding along at sixty to sixty-five, with only a few &quot;Oops! we're at
&gt; seventy&quot; bursts.  This is mainly because we feel the bus is happiest at
&gt; the lower speeds.  Found that the big trucks first blow you outward and
&gt; then suck you back in, haven't driven a vehicle that does that in years.
&gt; 
&gt;   Going to brave the rest of the journey up the dreaded I81 corridor. 
&gt; Mostly since it is the most direct route from here to there.

you may not want to take the I81 corridor.  seems there is going to be
mucho snow and from the south you may not be much experienced with the
truckers in the snow...  also I-81 is very hilly and has some place that
are quite remote.  the area aroound Harrisburg is VERY congested and under
construction,  probably has been under construction for about the last 800
years.  it is mostly truckers and they fly low...the big &quot;opps&quot; on my van
is from a trucker on I-81 near Wilkes Barre..

my suggestion, is the NJ turnpike to the last exit before Geo Wash bridge
and then get on the Palisaides parkway and then over the Tappen Zee bridge
and up from there.  or when I go skiing I take NJ turnpike to exit 18W and
then catch route 17 North to I-87 (NY thruway) this gets you into the same
area.. is faster but if your not careful easy to get lost, very poor
signage.

&gt;   All in all a very wonderful trip so far.  Tomorrow the weather is going
&gt; to be a little uncertain but Im not worried about it.  We should arrive
&gt; at our destination: Clinton N.Y. in the early afternoon.

I ski at Windham near Oneonta,, trust me knowing where I'm going and all
the turns and it is still a good 7-8 hours from Baltimore.  lots of
slugging up some many mile long grades.  and it is likely to be 6-10
inches of snow that way.  

&gt;   I have printed all of the A.I.R.S. list that is pertinent to our trip. 
&gt; I signed up myself, a long time ago when the weather was warm and balmy.

well I'm right here in Baltimore if you need help, my number is on the
list

good luck
Bob
