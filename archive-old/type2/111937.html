&gt; Hey All,

&gt;   I changed my oil today and found that the studs are too short to firmly

Perhaps, but these studs are quite short to begin with.  If the oil screen
gaskets are a bit too thick it can be hard to put things in place.  One
way to do it is to use a floor or scissors jack _lightly_ to hold the
plate in place when replacing the blind nuts.  Raise the jack to the plate
and lift the engine an inch or so, but no further!
