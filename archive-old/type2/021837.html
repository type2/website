Subject: removing the engine - pt 2

How tall is the engine when it's sitting on the ground with no intake 
stuff on it ('s' tube, afm, etc).

So, when I remove the engines from my 76 and 78 busses, should I remove 
the exhaust?  If I have the car on jackstands, will I just be able to 
use the jack to lower the engine and then roll the engine out (on the jack)?

I have no idea how high I really need to get the bus up (like, whether 
jackstands are tall enough) before the engine will come out.

Thanks,
Mike
