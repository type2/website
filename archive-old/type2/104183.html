Check the Bentley. Use what it shows for your engine, nothing else.

I also have
&gt;been chasing down an intermittent hesitation problem which may have been due
&gt;to the plugs needing to be regapped (they had 18K miles on them, and were worn
&gt;out to .031&quot;, when they should be .024&quot;).

Negatory. At 0.2mm wear over spec, replace them. Never regap worn plugs. 
Rounded electrodes do not offer nearly as good a spark as new plugs with 
sharp edges. You can expect 2 or 3 or more miles per gallon better with new 
plugs.
