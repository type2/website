Subject: '79 bus starter problems resolved

I finally got my bus on the road again. Working on it for a 1/2 hour
here and there, things are working again.

The basic problem reported 2 months ago was an intermittent
no start. This time my bus died in my driveway, so I could finally
troubleshoot the problem instead of push starting are driving away.
Whacking the solenoid, and rocking the bus in gear did nothing
to help things. Turned the key and nothing except a faint click (probably
my starter relay). Yes, I had a relay, so this shouldn't be the typical
&quot;hot start&quot; problem. 

I got a rebuilt starter from my FLAPS. I get it home, and notice that
the solenoid doesn't have the 2 push on connectors required for a
fuel injection installation. A week later, I finally get the proper starter
installed and hooked up. Turn the key and nothing.

I tried a bunch of stuff over the next few weeks, as time permitted.

Pulled my relay, and bench tested it - checked OK
Redid my wire connections at the solenoid - Still no start
Wired across the 2 big solenoid connectors - The starter spun OK
Wired from the solenoid big connector to the terminal 50 tab,
and nothing happened.
Pulled the starter out of the bus for a bench test - Sure enough,
the solenoid wasn't working.
Back to the FLAPS for another new starter.
Bench tested the new starter/solenoid - everything worked.
Went to wire up the solenoid and my socket wouldn't fit on the
big nuts - damn thing had non-metric nuts this time.
Back to the FLAPS to get metric nuts - last thing I need is to carry
an extra socket just for the solenoid.

Saturday, I installed the new starter in the bus and life is good again.

Morals of the story:
1) It is always the last thing you suspect that is broken.
2) Bench test those new/rebuilt parts before crawling under the bus
    and getting dirty.
3) Drive the extra 20 miles to the good VWFLAPS instead of the 
   local generic FLAPS.
