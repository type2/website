Subject: Re: [T2] Wheel Bearings and Ron's rant about 'quality parts'

&gt;  It was not a
&gt; lack of grease that caused this bearing to fail.  It was, plain and
simple,
&gt; very poor quality parts.

Every year Mercedes-Benz has a Master Challeng quiz for MB dealership techs.
A few years back I missed a question asking &quot;What happens when you put too
much grease in a front wheel bearing?&quot;. The correct answer blew me away. I
had to find it and verify it.
Your picture of the new bearings and saying that you used almost a tub of
grease reminded me of the correct answer.
The bearings overheat!
This is not an old farmers tale....it is straight from Mercedes-Benz. And
they have been building cars longer than anyone else:)
