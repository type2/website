Subject: Re: [T2] Where to buy fuel line clamp

Hi Bob,

I'd be careful with the use of that second valve as a theft  
deterrent. The stock fuel pump is rated for auto-shutoff at something  
around 110 PSI. If there's no way for the fuel to go back to the tank  
then you will pressurize the entire fuel rail at three times its  
rated spec.

Sounds dangerous to me. And although the bus would be running rich,  
it would probably still run. Can anyone verify this from experience  
with plugged return lines?

I heard of a boat just north of Toronto that was running megasquirt  
FI with an incorrectly routed fuel return line. The fuel was being  
returned to only one of the two tanks on board. When the tank  
overfilled it ruptured, the fuel ignited and the boat burned to the  
water line.


Happy trails,
