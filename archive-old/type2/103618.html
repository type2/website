Subject: Re: [T2] Buses on very bad roads: fine or foolhardy?

Amen on going a lot of places that current suv's would freak out over.

George's comments in the previous post are right on.  

I too have been places in a 65 DC and 67 and 72 that would make some
of the current SUV guys freak out....but! I was young and foolish and 
could hike out 10 miles if I needed to&lt;grin&gt;.

Before rust go to be an issue on the front beams, my opinion of them
was that they were near indestructible.

Ground clearance on a 72 bus was much more than a jeep...just take into
account the length between the wheels.

Cheers, dave
