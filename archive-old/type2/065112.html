Subject: a note on KYB shocks

I've had the KYB gas-A-justs on my breadloaf for a few hundred miles
now and I thought I would share my impressions.

In conjunction with the new EMPI sway-bar in the back and the
beefed-up sway-bar up front, roadhandling is much improved. The bus
leans less in curves and is much less affected by gusty side winds and
passing trucks. No more white knuckle driving! Note, however, that I'm
comparing the *new* KYB with *old*, completely worn shocks, so I'm not
sure how much of the improvement is to be attributed to age and how
much to design. 

There is a down side, though. The Gas-A-Justs are *very* stiff and
make for a harsh ride, harsh enough for me to contemplate replacing
the shocks up front with the softer (so I'm told) KYB GR-2 gas struts.
Dennis Haynes recommends this combination (GR-2 up front, Gas-A-Justs
in the back) for the vanagon, so I would *assume* it's also a viable
alternative for the breadloaf (but don't know for sure).
