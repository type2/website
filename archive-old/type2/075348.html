Subject: oil temp sender?

I ordered some stuff from JC Whitney recently, and
experienced their interesting retail strategy. I
didn't get certain items I ordered, but I also got
items that I hadn't previously considered. Among the
latter was an oil temp gauge, which seems to lack a
sender unit. How do I get the information from the
engine to the gauge? Muir says that there are dip
stick sender units. Is this still true? Where are they
available? Thanks.
