Subject: Re: Grease in my boots ???

Nicholas,
According to the Bentley, you should use a total of 3.2 oz (90g) of grease 
of which 2/3 is packed bewtween the joint and the protective cap (the metal 
flange with 6 holes in it) and 1/3 to pack the open front of the cv-joint. I 
think if you follow that instruction you will not have enough to also pack 
the boot, nor would you want to do that, at the risk of blowing out the boot 
by using too much grease.
