Subject: Help! torsion tubes BAROKE!!

WEll, i discovered the cause of many problems lately...

firstoof, i finially realized why the bus has been a bit of a pain to 
start since i got her...and, just yesterday, she WOULDNT start. Simple. 
Coil...weak, and finially mostly died, occasionally with enough juice to 
fire...so, on i tossed one from my dads Ni**an p/u..his with the dual 
ignition and this and that...truck has 215k miles on it, 190k of which 
went on those coils, he put a tranny in at 190k from a truck that had 
90k, he also took the coilfrom the 90k truck...point being, why cant OUR 
coils do that?!?! oh, the coil i took off was a genuine bosch...w/ the VW 
emblem and P/N, it was the shorter type...

anyway, new/old coil in, and ona hardlyabletoturntheengineover battery, 
boom, cranked right up! turned over maybe 1 ful turn..so, i drive the bus 
over to the school....

on the way, i hear/feel a kaklunk! and begin a severe unexpected lane 
change, acces the suicide lane, and 2 lanes of oncoming traffic, over the 
curb, up onto the sidewalk, then due to on comming signs, back to my side 
of the street...luckly, no traffic...


So, i get to the school. whole time fighting the bus to drive straight...

Oh, a bit of history..i realized a few months ago that i would need to be 
replacing the beam, due to a bit of rust at the bottom of the pass. 
upright between beams..&lt;see picture of my 75, the think other side, 
bottom, worse..&gt; So, anyway....a few days ago the clunking starts, first 
a tapping, then a kawhamplunk. Oh, the bus has been gradually pulling 
worse and worse to the right since i got her..
anyway, the thumping starts, i then explain it ina message to you 
alls...then it sont start, so, i have to fix that...so now....


I nned: a GOOD SLID preferable w/ good joints, tierods, ends, steering 
etc, if possible front beam. Preferabley int eh KC area...has to go on a 
69, although, i remeber talk a while back before the split of '96, talk 
of using a later disc brake one...yeah, i know i'd need the vaccum place 
on the manifold.._dot_can do...anyhow, HELP!

plaease, if you can help, in the Kansas City ARea preferabley, CALL! 561-3518
leave a message cause i douby anyone will be here..i think the area code 
is 816...jon, how about it? btw, cheap is better..dad is going to help me 
with this, but....his finiances arnt any better than mine...well, much...


oh, and i NEED MY BUS! you know...there is this girl in the show, and 
well, its hard to talk wiht her when you have to leave on the whim of the 
Tech. director....as in, &quot;i'm leaving&quot;, and the actors are still 
finishing up...you know?:)

appealing to the heart of you all....
