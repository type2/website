Subject: tire FART again, Re: [T2] Our tire fits what other vehicles?

&gt;My daughter slashed a Wrangler LT on some construction metal- can
 &gt;anyone tell me what other vehicles use our size (185R14C)?  

Wrangler LT doesn't come in 185R14C does it?

IIRC, late 80's Volvo 240 Wagon required 185R14C, but looks like Tire Rack has this car listed as 195/75R14 (more widely available size). I believe spec should be 185R14C.

Also,
&gt;what is the actual &quot;aspect ratio&quot; as some search options ask for?

82, but just leave as &quot;no number&quot; in search engines.

keep in mind there are a limited number of tires available in 185R14C 
Load Range D.

Hankook RA08 (_at_ Bus Depot) (all-season, good value)  &lt;--I use these
Wynstar Phaser (all-season, great value, Chinese Michelin company)
Vredestein Comtrac (summer/highway, $$$)
Continental Vanco-8 (all-season)
Vredestein Comtrac Winter  (all season, $$$)
Nokian Hakkepelita (hardcore winter, $$$$)
Bridgestone 603V (summer/highway)
Yokohama Y356 (summer/highway, only load range C)
Michelin Agelis (all-season, $$$)
YKS (rare)

YMMV, others may have brands to add to the list, corrections, or LT 
comparables.
