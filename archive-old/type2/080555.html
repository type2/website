Subject: RE: [T2] Fuel Fill Hose, Filler neckto tank 72-79 Bus HELP!

Theodore, there was a thread not long ago excitedly naming some turbocharger
or supercharger hose as a direct and cheap replacement. Anybody remember?
Also try the archives, it may be in there.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone know where I can find this part?            The number is
&gt; 211-201-125D.
&gt;
&gt;      Bus Boys lists it but NLA, I called my dealer in Annapolis and he
&gt; checked and also said NLA. Bus Depot sells the upper filler neck collar
&gt; (211-201-119) but that is not the one I need. Mine is badly dryrotted and
&gt; leaking gas when the tank is more than 1/2 full and going around turns or
&gt; on fill up. Please help as I want to go camping this weekend and
&gt; was hoping
&gt; to take Possum for her maiden camping trip. Used is fine with me
&gt; as long as
&gt; it is in good shape.
