Subject: Replacing battery tray

Rusted out battery tray, just realized that my battery falling through to
the ground below is a real possibility.  I have a buddy who is a welder,
thinking I need to buy him some beer.  Where would I get a replacement
piece?  Any scrap metal acceptable?  Thanks folks.
