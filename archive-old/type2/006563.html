&gt;Can someone explain the different ratings?  In my manual for another car I
&gt;own, it specifies to use fuel w/ CLC 90, AKI 92, or RON 95 or 96 octane
&gt;rating.  At all our pumps (I live in So. Cal.) the yellow rating stickers
&gt;say the rating is derived from the (R+M)/2 method.
&gt;My question is - which of the above is this method?  Thanks.


Scott, good question.  The (R+M)/2 method is also known as the CLC method.
This is the number that you will see on a sticker on gas pumps in the US.
