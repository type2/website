Subject: Re: [T2] Window-unit A/C install... Anyone got pics?

Glenn,

I hope the program mentioned that it is becoming illegal in lots of places 
for the truckers to do that.

I have a buddy in the A/C business that manufacturers a unit for the 
truckers that has a 5hp motor and heat pump...supplies either A/C or heat 
as needed.

Sorry guys, sized for a *big* truck, not for busses.


Cheers, dave

&gt; I just watched a tape of the 'Motor Week' show that was rerun maybe 2 weeks 
&gt; ago. One of the segments deals with idling of large Diesel trucks while parked 
&gt; (for crew sleeping, mainly).  

Their point: It is dumb to run a huge engine for  the purpose of 
powering a small A/C unit.  The segment showcases a system 


 available at a number of places where the truckers refuel, shower, and sleep.  
 The truck is issued a filler panel specific to his passenger cab window; the 
 driver then pulls into a slot, places the filler in the window, and hooks up a 
&gt; large hose, maybe 12&quot; diameter or so.  This hose brings in cool air in summer, 
&gt; heated air in winter.  The filler panel also includes a monitor and speaker, 
&gt; allowing the trucker to watch TV programs.  I think they also said it has 
&gt; Internet hookup available!
