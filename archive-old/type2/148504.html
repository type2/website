Subject: Heater Airflow Boost

Our Westy had an inline fan mounted under the bus on the main
ventilation duct. It moved more air, but it was noisy. I can't say if
the heated air would have melted the fan blades because of all the air
leaks in the heat exchangers and duct system. The outside air that was
drawn into the stock booster fan in the engine compartment was about
10 degrees ambient when using the fans to increase the airflow rate.
With temps like that crossing the heat exchangers, air leaks and heat
loss on the duct system, it's hard to imagine that. I would think that
IF the heat exchangers were in good condition, and no air leaks in the
duct system, that air temps would be higher and MAYBE the fan blades
might suffer.

I removed the fan and am in the process of making the heat exchangers
and dusct system as tight and well constructed as possible.
