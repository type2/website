I agree...when it's that cold, starting fluid should
do the trick. I wonder if the gasoline has a hard time
turning into a &quot;gas&quot; at these temps?????

&gt; If I remember my history correct, wasn't cold
&gt; weather usage a must when
&gt; designing the first VW's?  And from what I have
&gt; read, the VW's on the
&gt; Russian front were at times the only things that
&gt; would run in the cold.

Yep, and they built bonfires under their tanks so that
they wouldn't freeze solid!

I had a friend from Alaska who told me that during
severe cold-spells, they simply leave their cars
running 24 hours a day!!!!


Have a good one.
