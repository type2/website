Subject: Re: [T2] 009 distributor? Why not?

Not knowing squat about power curves, etc. I hesitate
to say this, but I owned a '66 bus, original engine.
but it had a 009. I ran it all over the country, never
noticed anything amiss. I remember it fondly as the
best VW  i ever had.

Now I own a 68 that has the same engine as the 66 and
a vacuum advance dist. Runs just as wonderfully as my
'66.

&lt;shrug?&gt; I guess it's like wine. One needs to develop
a &quot;nose&quot; and a &quot;palate&quot; to fully appreciate a good dizzy.
