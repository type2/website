I've got a line on a '59 cab partition.  Will it work in my '66
without major surgery (at least to the partition)?

You mean the hardboard divider between the cab and rear for a panel van?
  yes they are the same for all post barndoor splitties.   The only
difference is the logo on the glass.   Try to get the wedges for the upper
corners and the rubber strip around the vent too, if possible.
