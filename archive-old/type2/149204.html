Subject: Engine missing on 1st cylinder.

I got my new muffler installed today, and my mechanic said that I might 
have a loose plug wire.  The engine has been running a bit rough, so I 
checked to see that each plug wire was attached properly.  Once I got 
home, and it was still running rough, I pulled the plug wires one at a 
time with the engine on.  This is what I found.

Cylinders 2-3-4: Pulled each wire and put it back on.  The engine ran 
even rougher with each wire off and the engine would die.

Cylinder 1:  Pulled the plug wire... and nothing changed.  I put an 
extra plug into the wire and grounded the plug.   I had lots of spark.  
I pulled the plug and replaced it with the one I tested then started up 
the bus and pulled the wire.  Nothing, no change in how the engine was 
running.

The plug I pulled was wet, smelled of oil and gas.

I'm not sure what to check next.  When driving I will occasionally get 
a surge of power for a few blocks as if the everything is fine, then 
I'm back to the feeling of running on 3 cylinders.  Since I checked 
spark, I'm not sure what to check next.
