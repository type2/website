Subject: Re: [T2] 72 westy shuts down when hot

&gt; I just purchased a 72 Westy, beautiful looking bus but..., after  
&gt; about 40-45 minutes of driving it shuts down. No warning lights, or  
&gt; any other obvious problems. My mechanic tried to diagnose over the  
&gt; phone, and gave me a replacement coil, no change. It again drove  
&gt; fine for 45 minutes and again shut down. Any ideas or suggestions?  
&gt; Thanks in advance

Perhaps some kind of overheating issue. Have you checked the valve  
clearances lately?
