Subject: Re: [T2] WAS  RE: no brake NOW Is there a Diagram?

Forget the 9 pin. I have owned 1968 and 1969 buses, been to the 
wreckers and stripped some out. I have yet to see a 1968 or 1969 bus 
that was wired according to the Bentley with regard to the flasher 
set up.

10 fuses and a 4 pin relay is correct for 68-69. The 4 pin flasher 
relay and the the e-flasher switch handle the function of thte 
mythical 9 pin flasher. The brake lights are hooked up through the 
e-flasher switch because the brake lights and the flashers are the 
same filament in the rear bulbs (same circuit.) The black and red and 
the black and yellow wire should go to the e-flasher. Look for empty 
terminals or pull the flasher switch look for numbers on it. You will 
find the numbers also on the bulb holders(front and rear) as well as 
on the Bentley diagram. These are the terminal numbers and show you 
the path of the circuit.

I know this is a pain because I have been there before but you can do it.

BTW, 68-69 has different brake switches and I have never bothered to 
get the brake warning light working on any of mine because the master 
cylinder has always been replaced with the newer switches with 
different terminals.

Good luck!
