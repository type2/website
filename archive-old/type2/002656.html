Thanks George and Chris for the replies. This was exactly the answers I
needed. I had checked the Muir manual before asking the question but I was
either too lazy or just too tired to be 100% sure I could do this with the
1971 bus manifold. This will probably be my solution. The next question is
however: what if I want to run dual carbs?
