George,

I guess my next question will be-----

Where in the heck are you running your Type 2 bus that creates enough
abrasive dust to choke off your air filter?

I wasn't aware that VW created a T-2 syncro, or  Hummer, or 4wd vehicle
that could compete in the Baja, Barstow to Vegas, or Paris to Dakar,
competition. 

A K&amp;N filter would be just fine under normal, as designed, intended
vehicle usage.

And then, if you wanted to go 4-wheeling, or trail riding, a K&amp;N foam
pre filter is available, to trap all those microscopic dust elements,
that may just pass through the K&amp;N ( or any other fitter) under these
adverse conditions that you mention.

One more thought-----

I work on, and service several Terex TS-14's (scrapers) and yes the
centrifuge type pre filter helps, but nothing,and I repeat nothing,
totally stops the dust from entering the engine (especially the rear
pusher engine) regardless of the filtration used.
I just thought this was an,terribly unfair picture to paint, as there is
no way any VW T-2 bus, would ever in it's entire lifetime, ingest the
amount of abrasives that an off-road earthmoving piece of equipment
would, or any other off road intended vehicle.

The engines life in one of these unit's is good no more than two
seasons,even with a bi-weekly filter change.

Under normal, everyday, driving the K&amp;N filtration system is more than
adequate.



Later,
