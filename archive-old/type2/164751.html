Subject: Re: [T2] the search for heat ends now .. Espar Airtronic
  D2installation

so,, I called around in the last few days,, Southern Ontario Canada is sort
of a cold climate,, I know that is relative... Winnipeg is C O L D...
we are actually about the same as Northern Calif...

anyway... The people I talked to knew right away what I was after.. and they
knew they didn't have any in stock... and they knew they were worth over $1k
new... so a working unit would be $800....or so.. if they got one in... and
they usually don't as folks transfer them to the new trucks..

that is about  $850 usa dollars :-)

&gt; Ask for an Espar diesel fired rear bunk heater.
&gt;
&gt; Or an accessory diesel fired rear bunk heater.
&gt;
&gt; They're out there--you just have to find the right truck bone yard--an I
&gt; would think not in a warm climate---
