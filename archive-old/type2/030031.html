&gt; The original air-cooled Vanagons had 12 points, but anyone who has ever

&gt; heads now, but there are certainly a few with 12 points.  Check before you
&gt; get started.

&quot;With any sense?&quot;  Sounds kind of insulting to those of us who have
replaced our bolts with the correct 12-point bolts. :)

The 12-point driver is more positive and less prone to slippage than the
6-point Allen driver.  It can transfer more torque, which is probably why
VW went to the trouble of supplying them.  Every boot kit that I have run
across that includes bolts has 12-point bolts in it.
