Subject: [T2] Can you explain?

It's Friday so can anyone explain the strange behaviour _at_ shows (at least
here in the UK).

1.
The bug crush, where a poor old bug gets as many people in &amp; on it until
every panel is shagged?

2.
The engine burn-out when an old un-suspecting engine gets strapped to a
stand &amp; run _at_ FULL throttle until it first catches fire &amp; then (eventually)
seizes &amp; fails all together?

Andrew
