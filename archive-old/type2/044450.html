Thus spoke George Lyle of glyle_at_lenti.type2_dot_com on 8/18/00 4:03 PM:

&gt; Perhaps I'll make it easier still, and just measure the absolute pressure
&gt; in the engine bay at various operating conditions.  With engine off,
&gt; engine idling, engine revved, and moving with engine revved.  That way we
&gt; can sort out the cause of each change.

Actually, I was hoping you would mount the manometer on three orthogonal
lead screws controlled by stepper motors which are in turn controlled by a
'pewter. Oh, and we'll need a tach input and a fourth lead screw on the
carb. And don't forget to measure half-shaft speed. (To make things easier,
we'll assume zero wind speed by conducting measurements in two directions
and averaging.) This will give us an isobar plot for the engine in three
dimensions for several combinations of car speed and engine revs. :) :)&gt; :)
:)

The list thanks you in advance for your meticulous work. :) :)&gt; :) :)

PS: do what all the greats did: get your grad students to do the work then
take all the credit.
