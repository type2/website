Subject: VW's in Animation

Went to Spike and Mike's Festival of Animation tonight, here in Sacramento.
A must-see cultural event!  This stuff is hilarious!

Anyway, there is one animated short called &quot;Hut Sluts&quot; set in southern Cal,
with these 2 betties running around in a slammed cabriolet, and there's a
split-window bus at this party they go to.
