Pat:

You better start at the beginning on this one.  The assumption is that you
had a (poorly) running engine that you decided to rebuild.  You take the
heads to a (experienced, reputable) rebuilder who has to flycut the heads to
clean up the head/cylinder interface.  The (experienced, reputable)
rebuilder provides shims for under the cylinders that matches the amount of
the flycut, so everything's back in order.

So:
  1) Why did the (experienced, reputable) head rebuilder open up the
       combustion chambers instead of providing shims equal to the
       amount of the flycut?
  2) What's with the &quot;This was my original problem&quot; (too long pushrods)
       statement?  That kind of blows the original assumption.  What made
       you come to this conclusion?

As far as I know, there's no place to find original VW engine dimensions;
they seem to be the closely guarded secrets of the black elves.

&gt; This is really getting frustrating.  Is there a way to tell if my heads
have
&gt; been flycut too much?  The machine shop had to make the combustion chamber
&gt; bigger to lower my CR.  Now even with .060&quot; shim at the bottom, the
pushrods
&gt; are too long.  This was my original problem.  Is there a place where I can
&gt; get various dimensions for the heads &amp; case?  Thanks.
