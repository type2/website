&gt;I've been deep 
&gt;into my Haines manual and type2_dot_com resources but I'm getting in a bit 
&gt;over my head.  Any ideas where to go next, cold start valve, thermotime 
&gt;switch?

* Air

Has the connector on the AFM come loose?

Are any large hoses missing/loose?

* Fuel

You have verified fuel delivery at the pump but are the injectors spraying?

Is the wire wire from FI harness connected to terminal 1 on the coil?

Is the FI harness properly grounded under the air plenum?

Is there a good ohm reading from the temp sensor II?

* Spark

Have you seen each spark plug fire?

Is the timing and dwell correct?
