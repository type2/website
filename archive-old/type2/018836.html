&gt; &gt; &gt; Me too!  I took a BFA, (sculpture and art history mostly), from U. of Colo. ...ancient
&gt; &gt; &gt; history now.  I'm doing the CVs on my Rabbit at the moment (one badly galled and
&gt; &gt; &gt; will be replaced).  If you have the tools and the inclination, there are two ways to
&gt; &gt; &gt; renew the boot.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Get the correct split boot kit which is available complete with grease, boot,
&gt; &gt; &gt; bolts, nuts, instructions, and glue (I have one of these split boots on my Rabbit
&gt; &gt; &gt; for the last 25k miles).  These let you replace the damaged boot without removing
&gt; &gt; &gt; the driveshaft.  If there is grit, likely since the boot is not tight...
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) you'll want to take the axle off, remove the CVs (I'd do both once I had the axle
&gt; &gt; &gt; off), clean/inspect them for wear/galling, regrease, and fit with new boots if
&gt; &gt; &gt; required.  The original boots last well, and I reuse them if they aren't cracked or
&gt; &gt; &gt; ripped.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; If you have a repair manual (Haynes or Bentley) and the tools, maybe a pair of
&gt; &gt; &gt; jackstands this is a very doable operation. If not, a trustworthy mechanic is in
&gt; &gt; &gt; order.  If he removes the shaft, removes the joints, cleans/inspects, repacks with
&gt; &gt; &gt; grease, renew boots...easy 3 hours per side...shop rate say $40/hr....plus $10 ea.
&gt; &gt; &gt; for good German boots...total around $150-$200 per side if the joints don't need
&gt; &gt; &gt; replacement.  New joints: $100-$150/pair.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hey Kind Volks;
&gt; 
&gt;    ..snip..
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ...well I noticed that the rear CV joint boot on the inner side was badly
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eroded and loose...oil has soaked the whole axle rod...
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how big of a job is it to replace the CV joint boot seal??
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would this be a job for the VW doc....and if so, how much would it run me in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; $$?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do y'all think I should replace them ALL while I'm at it, or just the one
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bad one?
&gt; 
&gt;     ..snip..
