Subject: [T2] exhaust manifold difficulties

Hello everyone, my inexperience is showing, sorry!  I am in the process
of trying to get new exhaust manifold pipes for my 1978 california spec
bus.  A place named Reborn Parts has told me they have them, provided
that the ports are oval, which a fellow listee had written to me that
they are.  But before I can order them they want the part number and I
have no idea what that is or where to find it.  Do the old parts need to
be removed to get this info?  Also, I am in search of a fuel filler
neck; I called the Bus Depot and they are out, does anyone have any
leads?  Any enlightenment you can give me would be great.  Thanks, Beth
and Prudence, the 78 bus, in NJ.
