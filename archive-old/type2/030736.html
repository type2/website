Hm. I've heard so many different things about where to set it 'correctly'
that I'm not sure what else to do at this point. If I set it by ear, I can
set it to where it runs best. That turned out to be just short of 10BTDC.

Yes, I'm already in touch with this. I've just been trying to hold it
together enough to get the money up for an overhaul.

&gt; cheaper to overhaul an engine just before it drops a valve that to wait

Too true. On the other hand, it's also cheaper to figure out all the
things you're doing wrong before you replace/rebuild the engine than after
you ruin the second one... &lt;grin&gt;
