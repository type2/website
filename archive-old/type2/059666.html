Subject: valve guide tolerances

Last year I spent what,  for me, was a whole lot of money to buy Berg
semi-hemi heads to rebuild a 1776 for my Westy.  When I fired the engine up
on the test stand, the exhaust gases had a white tint to them. OK, I
reasoned, I shouldn't  judge anything during breakin.

A thousand miles later I pulled the engine to solve problems like
overheating,  really excessive oil usage, and ................... still the
white vapor.

I intended to leave the heads alone and just reinstall them.  Today,
however, I read on page 50 of Bill Fisher's How to Hot Rod ..... book that
the measurement of valve guide wear is relatively simple. So I pulled all
eight valves and did his test.  The minimum play that I measured was 0.003;
most were 0.005.  The play actually &quot;felt&quot; worse than the numbers
indicate.    This is the first time I've done this measurement so I don't
have a personal benchmark to go by. I intend to buy a set of new valve
guides just to create this reference.   In the meantime, I'll postpone the
rebuild (yet again) until those new guides arrive.

Has anyone made this measurement?  Is the 0.005 value excessive?  If so,
this has most likely contributed to my oil usage and to the white vapor.

I'd appreciate any comments you all might have.

Jack
