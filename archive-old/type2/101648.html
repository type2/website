Yep, those heat exchanger tailpipes are exactly that. My ' 78 has 'em
too. Came from the factory that way. Vents the hot air from the
exchangers to the rear of the bus, instead of under the bus. Late mod's
did not have 'em. Guess they didn't make much of a diff in eng. temp.
The exhaust pipes also make getting to the valve covers a real joy.
