Subject: Re: [T2] LOUD FUEL PUMP?

&gt;Hi Everyone,
&gt;Thanks to everyone for all the help I have gotten and I found a vaccum 
&gt;leak but I now have noticed that my fuel pump is really loud ( I can hear 
&gt;it from the drivers seat)  and it sounds like there is a mix of air and 
&gt;fuel going through it.  Anybody every have this problem with a clogged 
&gt;filter or pump about to go?

FI pumps get noisy either from fuel flow restriction or old age, and 
working extra hard to such fuel through a clogged filter will put age on 
them very fast. Verify the filter is clear and lines are not restricted. If 
that does not resolve the problem then the pump should be replaced.
