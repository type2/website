Subject: Clutches and alternators!

Nice weather today, thankfully.

Backed Ichigo into the shed, and yoinked her engine.

Pulled the clutch first, and the pre-pull inspection showed various small
metal shavings, as well as a well-worn throwout bearing surface, and PP
thowout surface.  The TO bearing still spins fine, but I think i'm going
to replace it anyway.  It is very shiny, and (by visual observation, no
measurement..but I might do that too) not as thick as before.  the edges
(outer and inner) are sharp, too.

On the PP, the surface has odd looking swirl-scores, as well as being very
shiny too.  Outer edges are sharp, but not as bad.

removed the plate, and found exactly what I'd expected. ~ half the fingers
have lost their spring.  With the plate sitting on the table, one side of
the TO surface sits lower then the other.  Requires very little pressure
to push that side of it down, whereas the other side requires the normal
amount.

Called NOPI, whom I purchased this from 6 months ago, and they said they
only have a 90 day warrenty on them.  *sigh*  But, since I'm such a well
known customer, and it is obviously defective, he's going to sell me one
at rockbottom price.  I'll go with that, unless anyone can offer other
vendors who can sell me a high quality NON sachs pressure plate....(with
TO ring)


as to the alternator, it WAS about time for it to die...been running since
74, when the factory put it on my super beetle. it then saw use on my 68
bug, the regulator was used in my 75 bus, then it all went into Ichigo
when her generator died...

It's got a few hundreds thousand miles, and I cant complain.

NOPI can get me an AL82X, new, for 111 something.  Minus the 10% discount
when I toss my military ID down.  They'll have it monday.  BD, and RM
would at least require it to be shipped, though their prices, without
shipping, (well, my cost anyhow!:) would have been similar.

AZ could get me a rebuilt (World Class) 82X for 100, plus 25$ core, by
tuesday.  A rebuilt 78X for 92 + 25$ core.  Decided to go with the new
82X...:)

Oh. Yeah.  I pulled the alt, and spinning it by hand, one hears this nice
clickityclickity sound....I may pull it apart later and look at it.  But
not now.  gotta go fight with moms bus.

later...david
