Subject: RE: [T2] How difficult is welding ?

&gt; Also remember there is a big difference between welding a patch panel into a door and welding suspension parts or trailer hitches... I still won't weld those items because of the liability... What if I weld something on and it looks good to my amateur eye but fails at 70 mph? Fine if it is a patch panel, bad if a 1500 lb trailer breaks free and nails another car killing someone. Or you weld on a hitch for a friend so he can haul a 300 lb trailer and 5 garbage cans back and forth to the dump and then he hauls 2500 lbs of stone home for a sidewalk project b/c just one trip prob won't hurt anything...

to take this just a bit further,  I will weld just about anything for
myself.  I won't weld nothing no how for anyone else, not even a shelf
braket for his wifes cookie jar.

yes, YMMV
