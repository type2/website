&gt;I am going to add a CB radio to my bus.  Went to Radio Shack, they have
&gt;one on sale, cool.  The problem is the selection of antenna.  I do not
&gt;what to use a magnetic mount, new paint.  I am deciding between the
&gt;large buggy whip bumper mount and a cell phone antenna look-a-like that
&gt;sticks to each side of the glass.  Anyone using either of these?  Any
&gt;suggestions for alternates?

I think I've used every kind there is.  My current antenna is the 
cell-phone look-a-like and it is the best compromise for me.  Small and 
unobtrusive, doesn't look tacky.  I don't get quite as good range as I got 
with some of the other types, but it's acceptable.  Better than some of my 
friends can get with handheld units.  I was also skeptical about it staying 
stuck to the glass, but it really does seem to be permanently attached at 
this point (I think I've had it for two years now).
