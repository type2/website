&gt;clean your plunger bores (a toothbrush with the bristles cut
&gt;to 1/2 height), make sure they slide all the way in and out on
&gt;the tip of a pencil. (Note: Dont use your little finger. I got mine
&gt;caught in the screw threads at the knuckle and had to
&gt;'unscrew' myself to get it out. A 'German Finger Trap' puzzle)

WooHooo!  I'm glad I'm not the only one to learn that trick the hard
way!
Way to go Chris.
