Subject: Re: [T2] Suggestion for removing broken cylinder stud

In a message dated 3/11/03 7:20:29 PM, jstric01_at_cs.fiu_dot_edu writes:

&lt;&lt; Any suggestion on a removal procedure I can do at home? Or is it off to
the machine shop for some heat treatment and careful drilling/tapping. I
thought I might use some liquid nitrogen to cool down the case to make
the threads looser. Think this will work?
 &gt;&gt;

Easy, cowboy...The procedure is to heat the case (expand) and cool the
stud (contract). If you freeze the case you'll likely just crack it...It 
might be a lot cheaper to take it to a machine shop rather than just
experiment at home...
