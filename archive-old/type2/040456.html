Subject: Display Menu and Westies

Now that we are starting to show our westie we wanted to create a
display with pictures and a short story to place in front of our bus. I
figured some one on this list has went thru the design stage before, can
you give suggestions and hints on what and how you designed it, and what
was said. Better yet if you have a picture of one in front of your bus
at a show.

Also no concrete response on what the different models of westies would
have been called, I would still like to know what ours would have been
referred to. Mine has the closet, bed seat, over head cabinet, rear
facing seat, and had the ice box, no pop top. Again any clue, I want to
put it on the display board so any definitive help is appreciated.
