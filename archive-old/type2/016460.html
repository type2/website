&gt; 1-NEVER set your emergency brake!!!
&gt; 2-Thoroughly lube all external cables (brake, speedo, clutch,
&gt; throttle, etc.) using LIGHT viscosity oil.
&gt;

       You also need to pull the throttle cable and clutch cable and grease
them. It's a serious PITA to go out and step on the gas only to find it
frozen solid -- and/or the clutch. Used to happen to mine every winter. And
the only solution is to either put it in a heated garage -- which wasn't an
option for us -- or crawl under with a propane torch and heat the cable
tubes -- and then pull the cables and grease them. We had very wet Fall
weather on the north shore of Lake Superior, and after driving thru a
multtude of puddles, the first real freeze stopped the VW's dead.
