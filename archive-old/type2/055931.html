After I posted the previous query about the abnormal wear on my lifters
(purchased from Web Cams Inc.), I took a closer look at the case, and
noticed that the cam bearings have abnormal wear.  The bearings in the
left half of the case are worn/scorred at about eight o'clock (facing
the rear of the engine and looking towards the front [FIF]).  The
bearings in the right half of the case are more evenly worn, but also
scorred.  The thrust bearing shows uneven and quite notable wear.  What
can cause this kind of phenomenon?

Thanks.  Eric
