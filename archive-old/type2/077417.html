Subject: Re: [T2] 76 teardown

Hi Billy
Chuck here, catching up between power outages.
my 2cents
if your not sure of p&amp;c size check your eng# and cross reference it for
cc's. If you dont have a book give me the # and I can look it up for you.
(wilsons how to rebuild is good) of course you can find the # on the piston
but that kinda slows you down.

personally if it was my head, I'd look for a rebuilder unless my head was
junk. The problem with exchange is you never know whos junk your getting.

Bakersfield is a hotbed of buggys and offroading, shouldn't be too hard to
find someone, been too many years since I've been there, the 3 day trip to
Fresno not withstanding.

good luck

Chuck

Subject: [T2] 76 teardown


&gt; listos:
&gt;
&gt; thanks to all who responded to my 76 teardown thread, especially al brase
who took my questions one by one.
&gt;
&gt; as you may know, my #3 exhaust valve broke at the stem (is this &quot;sucking&quot;
a valve?) and destroyed my head/piston.
&gt;
&gt; conditions: I have time/money to do this right. (miracle of miracles!)
&gt;
&gt; plan:
&gt;
&gt; 1. replace all cylinders/pistons with new. how do I size these when I
order them from someone? are they all 93mm?
&gt;
&gt; 2. should I:
&gt;
&gt; get one new head to match my other with the 75-78 exhaust manifold, or
would it be wiser to get a set of 72-74 with the more replaceable exhaust.
Mind you, my other bus is a 79 with the same 72-74 type of exhaust, which
would be nice for interchangeability.
&gt;
&gt; or should I match the 75-78? I have to pass smog in califonia till at
least 2006. do these exhausts change my chances of doing that, one versus
the other? I know I need a cat on both.
&gt;
&gt; 3. I've decided to have the case split and inspected, but I don't know who
to trust. I don't think I trust my regular &quot;keep it running&quot; guy for this
one, and I didn't get a lot of feedback on CB. Can anyone recommend someone
in the Fresno-Bakersfield california area?
&gt;
&gt; Isn't there a &quot;karl&quot; on the list from fresno? And chuck meanly, I know
you've been in the area to pick up your sundial, any thoughts?
&gt;
&gt; List, you guys are great, and lets follow Dave R.'s advice and not use the
list to get out our frustrations caused by others. Aren't we a team here?
&gt;
&gt; thanks,
&gt;
&gt; Bill
&gt;
