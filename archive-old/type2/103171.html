Subject: Re: [T2] removing rear brake drums

[...]

&gt; Bentley(ch. 8 p.24 sec 8.2)reccomends using a wheel puller. Any good tool
&gt; rental place should have one. If there is an autozone close by you can rent one
&gt; for free.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop!  You cannot use the puller pictured to just remove the drum. The drum fits over the
hub and studs. Turn back a page and look at the expolded pic of the rear brakes. #8 is the hub. All he wants
to do is remove the drum. The drum is just held on with the 2 11mm headed bolts, #6, and a LOT of rust around
the center circle. You need a real rust penetrent, i.e. Liquid Wrench, [NOT WD-40] and you need to soak the
inner circle. Then get a big hammer and hit the face of the drum flat between the studs. It will pop off. Do
not hit the studs!

&gt; Otherwise you can remove the castellated nut that holds the hub. For
&gt; this you need a 45mm or a 1 13/16 socket, preferably attatched to 3/4 inch
&gt; ratchet or flex bar(a long piece of pipe slipped over the end of the wrench
&gt; increases leverage). Remove cotter pin. With all 4 wheels on the ground, have a
&gt; helper apply maximum pressure to brake pedal. Now push the bar with all your
&gt; might, stand on it if you must, Repeat for other side. Now jack your bus up and
&gt; remove the hub nuts, teh hub and drum will follow.

Using a 46mm socket and pulling the hub and drum is a last resort. [yes you have to do it on the early bays
with one-piece hub and drum, but not 71 and up]
