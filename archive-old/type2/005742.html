Hi, I tryed to reach PLFVW also to get a new top made for my 71 Riviera and
there was a message on her website that she is not accepting any orders
until December.  I found a company here in Kansas City, MO that is making my
new top out of Herculite which is the same stuff as the original top was.
You may want to try to find someone in your area to work with.

Subject: [T2] PLFVW?


&gt; Hello Everyone.  It has been a while since I have subscribed to the list
so
&gt; I am kind of lost.  I have spent the last two years working full time and
&gt; finishing my college degree, so my VW has had a long rest.  I am wondering
&gt; if PLFVW is still operating?  I tried emailing and calling but I have not
&gt; received a response.  I checked the archive and only found an old thread
&gt; that didn't sound too promising, however more recent postings suggest she
&gt; still operating.  When I last subscribed to the list it was common
knowledge
&gt; that she crafted a superior product.  I am specifically interested in a
&gt; beige colored fabric that she offers.  Anyone have the latest info?  If
not
&gt; how about an alternative?
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Phillip Freund
