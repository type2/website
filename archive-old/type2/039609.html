&gt; If you are committed to tearing down your 1/2shaft, far be it from me to

I agree with this, although the level of the noise would dictate whether
the joint will come off.  By the time you have the shaft off and cleaned,
it isn't much farther to get the joint off.

When my joints are out for boot replacement, I wipe all the excess grease
away with paper towels and then regrease the joint.  Cleaning with solvent
is only needed if you are getting noise and want to really inspect the
joint.  My feeling is that solvent cleaning can remove the intimate film
of grease from the surfaces of the balls/races.  Better to leave that film
in place unless there is a good reason to remove it.
