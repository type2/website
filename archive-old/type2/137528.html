&gt;Can one take a clock out of a type 3 (squareback or fastback) and install

&gt;install in bus?

The type 3 clock is held to the dash with a couple of springy fingers. 
Reach up behind the dash, squeeze them towards the clock body, shove
forward through the dash hole.

The T3 clocks are usually broken, though .. I've only seen two that work
that haven't been repaired.  Ratwell posted a link to pelicanparts that covers
the fix, the 914 &quot;type 1&quot; clock is the same mechanism.
