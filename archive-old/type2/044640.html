Subject: [T2] Wont Idle :(

I'm having problems with my 70 Westy, she just wont idle.  I just
replace the entire exhaust and accelerator cable.  Checked the timing,
that looks ok.  Everything seems to be adjusted properly, but alas, it
just kills whenever I come to a stop.  Does anyone have any ideas what
else could be causing this?
