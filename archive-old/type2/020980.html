&gt; &gt; Has anyone done this? How hard is this thing to get off? Does anyone know of

&gt; Once you get it off (I'm still working on removing mine, so no help there,
&gt; sorry), take it to a place that does convertible top repairs. Zippers,
&gt; replacement plastic windows, etc., are their stock in trade.

Good idea.  
I took my original rotton pop-up tent to a sailmaker friend. He used the
old canvas as a pattern to sew up a replacement tent. The new material
he
used was excess/leftover canvas from an awning (side job). Sailmakers
also
have canvas, windows, zippers, and industrial sewing machines.
Best of luck,
