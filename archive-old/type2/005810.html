&gt; My Dad's Air-cooled 1982 California-spec Vanagon westy went for it's final
&gt; emissions check (after this it's old enough not to need another), and it
&gt; failed due to high Carbon Monoxide emissions. Here's the score:
&gt;
&gt; HC ppm    Limit 136   Score 84
&gt; CO%                 1.28          1.62
&gt; NOppm               1784         952
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Notice that the HC and NO are better than 30% below the limit, but the CO
%
&gt; is almost 30% over the limit.  When the westy was tested 2 years ago it
&gt; passed with flying colours, so Dad was really surprised when it failed
this
&gt; time around.
&gt;
&gt; When we had the clutch replaced recently, Denmeister noticed that the O2
&gt; sensor was disconnected, so he hooked it back up. Dad seemed to think the
&gt; Bus got a bit more powerful (or perhaps just a bit less hesitant) since.
&gt; Could this have had an impact on the CO reading, or should we be looking
at
&gt; something else. I don't think it's running rich, if it was then the HC
would
&gt; be higher, wouldn't it?
&gt;
&gt; Dad's pretty bummed out (Mom's term) about this, it's just the kind of
&gt; Birthday present you don't need, ya know?. I checked the archives and saw
&gt; that this problem has been seen before, but I didn't see a solution
posted,
&gt; at least not one that matched these details.

My daughters 77 Westy failed for the same reason: just over the limit on CO
at both 15 mph and 25 mph [we do dyno emission tests here in Calif.]
I believe that the problem is a tired used-up catalytic converter.
I ordered a new one from Bus Depot and I hope it shows up by Friday.
Saturday morning I will put it on and see if it lowers the CO. I will post
to the list if it corrects the problem.
