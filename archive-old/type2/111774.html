Subject: Cruise Control

I just wanted to let everyone know that I just
installed after-market electronic cruise control on my
bus and it works great.  I know allot of you, like
myself, take long trips with your buses and cruise
control is the only way to do it!

I bought my kit at a flea market for $25.00 CAD.  The
install took a few hours.  The kit includes everything
you need to install it on any vehicle and contains
many mounting options for the switch.  I mounted mine
to the turn signal switch because I'm used to it being
there from my Chevy but it can also be mounted to the
dash.

I have owned my bus for 7 years now and I think back
on the long trips and how great this option would have
been.

I recommend it to every bus owner.
