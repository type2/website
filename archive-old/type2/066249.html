Subject: Type II Pedigree Chart?

Hi All,

I'm wondering if anyone has ever seen a web site, or even a piece of 
paper that shows a reverse pedigree chart of the Type II? 

You know, going from early Pon idea to actual shipping units, then 
showing each of the bifurcations in the tree for each model change. 

If not, it would be an interesting web site to put up sometime. Heck, I'd 
even put it up on the web if I got the correct info. Anyone want to bite 
on this?
