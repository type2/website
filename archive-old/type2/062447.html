Mama took the camper on an errand tonight and called me from a parking lot
saying the car won't go. It had started fine and she had driven a bit before
stopping for a light. When attempting to move the car simply wouldn't
respond; it didn't quit it just wouldn't make any power. We had just
concluded a 400 mile trip through the mountains without incident.

I've had this happen to me before very occaisionally but only for a split
second. Aside from the fact that it was always when trying to &quot;dart&quot; across
traffic it wasn't very significant. When it happens to Mama it becomes
significant. Naturally when I went out to meet her it started and I drove it
home without incident. Anyone have an idea what's going on here?

Thanks,

Weston
