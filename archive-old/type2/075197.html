Subject: Re: [T2] painting an engine

Rick:
Black is best for radiation AND absorbtion. Conduction is something
different.
There is a possibility of the paint insulating qualities being greater
than the radiation advantage.
Apparently Bob Hoover feels there is an advantage there, because he
recommends painting the cylinders. Used cylinders tend to get a fuzzy cast
iron rust which would not form with black enamelling on them. In view of
the lack of empirical evidence, I'd be inclined to trust Bob Hoover's
judgment at least as much as about anyone else out there.
(Incidently, newbies to this list can get a _Bob Hoover's Sermons_ CD from
the Bus Depot and probably other  suppliers- well worth the $10 or so
cost.)
FWIW, Porsche used some kind of black coating on the heads and cylinders
of Super 90's (1960-62 vintage) and possibly later 4 cylinders, but
apparently dropped this practice on 911's. This was a very thin, very
black coating. The cylinders in this engine were light alloy. Perhaps with
the redesign of the 6 cylinder engine it simply was not necessary. I'm
certain that it worked, they certainly had the resources to find out!!

&gt;  I don't know specifics on the thermal
&gt; transfer rate of paint but a rule of thumb is the
&gt; better it conducts electricity the better it conducts
&gt; heat (there are lots of exceptions to this rule but
&gt; generaly it holds true) and paint does not conduct
&gt; electricity well.
&gt; For these reasons I feel it is a good idea to paint
&gt; your tin a dark/black color and keep your block,
&gt; heads, and jugs power washed clean.
&gt;
&gt; One final thought, I was going to paint the
&gt; transmission an enamel white to keep it running
&gt; cooler.  The white would reflect the IR heat from the
&gt; engine and hot road surface in the summer.  However,
&gt; as discussed above it will most likely add some
&gt; insulation factor.  Any thoughts?
