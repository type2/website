Subject: Re: valve train geometry: what is it?

 This is for the guy who spoke of the mystery down in the engine.

 Like everything it just opens more questions, but at least you know
what to ask.


&gt;Valve train geometry is a term I've run into a few times, but never
&gt;knew what is meant precisely:
&gt;
&gt;What are the symptoms of incorrect vtg?
&gt;How does one check if it's not correct?
&gt;How does one rectify vtg?

 Symptoms: Are just too inumerable and are the same as all the ilnesses we
find when things are out of adjustment.

 The poor thing is sick, has a fever, coughs, has no power, you name it.
 
 Here's my take based on mainly what I've read: 

 Goes clear back to the cam/crank connection. The cam will not necessarilly
be ground to the same TDC that the crank says is TDC.

 So you have to check that when you put the puppy together.

 If you have a fully adjustable cam you just move the gear around a tad till
they line up with each other. If you have stock non-adjust,
then you may elect to move it a tooth forward or backwards to get close.

 This is all set up and then you mark the pulley with your &quot;true TDC&quot;.

 Then you get to the push-rods which should all come out at the same 
height. Of course the valve stems also have to be at the same height.

 Then the valve springs have to all be the same height in closed 
position. The valve springs also have to have the same tension in 
open or closed postion.
 
Then you get the &quot;rocker arm&quot; and set the adjuster screws to &quot;half-
way&quot;.

 Then you shim the rocker arm so that when the valve is &quot;half-
open&quot; the center of the valve adjusting screw is in line with the center of
the valve-stem.

 Meaning the adjuster screw slides back and forth across the center of the
valve stem while doing its thing.

 Now if all is done right, the valves will all open the same amount 
at the &quot;proper&quot; time on all pistons.

 Down on the other end is the cam/crank gear which have &quot;zero&quot; back-
lash, meaning no &quot;slop&quot;.

 Beyond that is the dizzy timing gear which should also have &quot;zero&quot; 
slop.

 This is then engaged to a nice tight distributor which is also set to
the proper #1 plug .

 In a race engine, I expect they spend weeks getting this all in order.

 I have heard that some cams can be as much as 10 degrees off of &quot;true
TDC. Of course you also have to check Every Lobe, not just #1.

 If you're building the engine, then you can check a lot of this stuff
and set to the best of your ability and instruments.

 If the engine is already built, about all you can do is get the stuff
in the &quot;rocker arm box&quot; as close as possible.

  
 If you don't have unlimited patience and money just buy the chrome 
tin and let it go at that.

 You would probably go thru dozens of cams etc, suppliers and so on.

 Use &quot;VTG&quot; in bars when you're trying to blow smoke at the other guy.

 Is it important?  I think it's the most important. 
  I can't even get my FLAPS to stock new gears, he just sells them over and
over.

 &quot;well, that's the name of that tune&quot;    west
