Subject: reassembling doors

Hi, I'm reassembling the front doors on my '70 westy.    I've got the
vent window, the outside trim piece with the wiper, and the inside
window wiper piece.    Could someone please tell me in what order to
assemble these three pieces?    I'm afraid if I do it wrong, I won't be
able to get the trim pieces off without bending them.
 
thanks a lot,
 
-mike
