I currently find myself and my 71 Bay window in a bit of a pickle and
thought that I would ask anyone on the list to share their views in an
effort to resolve my current indecision.
Background is thus:
When the original engine dropped a valve, I was recommended a mechanic. He
quoted a figure which myself and my wife could not afford at that time to
fit a new engine ....we currently chose a well known ( but crap ) company
who installed a Brazilian engine at a lower price.
For the 1st service I approached the mechanic I spoke of earlier and he has
been working on it since......and has not been happy with the things he's
found in this engine ( engine been dropped once when it dispensed all its
oil due to the fact that the metal bung at the back of the engine had been
replaced with a plastic playing checker and araldite and that it sported no
thermostat and flaps ...to name a few things. )
He has never been shy of reminding me that had HE fitted the
engine........etc, etc, etc.
Current situation is thus:
1641cc unleaded upright engine with about 20K on it.
#4 cylinder is not firing due to rings ( established by my current mechanic
in a leakdown test ).
I have got Wilsons book ( after Muirs rambling descriptions about when to
tie your hair up and when to ball, it was refreshingly
scientific......thanks to all on the list who recommended it ) but bus is a
daily driver for both work and family and do not have a garage to do it ....
so......aproached aforementioned mechanic whose only remedy is to replace
barrels, pistons and heads with new stock 1600cc German parts ( compressions
on the 1641 were all itro 145-150psi due to no spacers on the heads with a
bigger bore ) and comes out with a bill of £700 - £800 for the job.
I'm sure this figure is probably right given parts and labour, but it's a
ring that's broken....right, and the heads may not be german but they ARE
only two years old !
I know find myself in a position of spending this money, which I MAY NOT
have to, which at this time of the year is best spent on my wife and kids
 and me )........or...., and this seems the only alternative, going to
another mechanic and getting only what needs doing done, which means I could
never go back with a problem without being told ' I told you
so...!'...........and that usually puts a little bit extra on the bill !
Any suggestions from listees would be appreciated as always....especially
now.
Happy impending Xmas
Garp, Liis, Isis and J'
71 Dormobile .....slightly hungover
