Subject: Trailer hitches 1973 thru 1991

Ok,, who needs a trailer hitch for Christmas?
Trailer Hitches for Late model Bay Vw Bus  AND NOW Vanagon 

This would be the BEST time to leave hints for Your Significant Other. Christmas
is coming.. for that matter, so is your Birthday! 
Especially those S.O.'s who have BASHED their shins on those OTHER style of
hitches. They will be very happy you are thinking about THEM when you order and
install this hitch!
This one hides below the bumper and makes it sooo much easier to get in and out
of the rear hatch without bruising your leg!

I have a couple ready for immediate shipment,, and will gladly take orders.

Removable square 1 1/4&quot; Receiver Style, *or* fixed Tongue
This hitch fits '73 to '79 Vw Bus 
It accepts any size ball or attachment with a 3/4&quot;  bolt or stud,,  
This hitch should not interfere with your stock style muffler. 
you do NOT have to modify the bumper at all
