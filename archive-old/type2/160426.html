Subject: [Q] (Simple) Solenoid Question

Greetings,

I am sure this is simple to those who know, but *where* is the starting 
solenoid on a '71 Camper?  I believe mine has gone bad, and I plan on 
verifying this by attempting to start my engine by shorting out the 
solenoid's terminals.  I know about taking the Camper out of gear first, 
and I plan on applying the parking brake.

Any thoughts?  I make a cursory look inside the engine compartment, but it 
wasn't obvious.

TIA,
David
