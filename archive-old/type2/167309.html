&gt;I've been looking for parts
&gt;online and BusDepot has some rotors by Zimmerman.
&gt;Anyone have experience with these? 

Zimmerman and Brembo are both excellent brands.

&gt;Also, I have the factory blue manual, plus the Haynes,
&gt;and the Muir books and consider myself pretty handy.
&gt;Do you think rotors/pads is a job do-able at home? 

It's a one person job but you need these tools:

- lugwrench to remove the wheel
- jack to get the wheel off the ground
- allen key to remove the rotor
- pin punch to remove the brake pad spreader spring
- piston spreader to allow the thicker pads to go in after

The backing plates have little tabs that engage the slots in the caliper's piston. They get flattened and need to be popped out with a screwdriver (just a little).

As the tabs go flat, the pistons can rotate in their bores and it's often the case that they need to be reset. There is a special tool I use for this and I'm not sure of other techniques (anyone?). The piston is made from a pot metal and trying to force move it with a screwdriver will damage it.

Check the piston dust seal with a flashlight to see if it's torn.

I believe all of this info applies to 71-72 brakes as it does to 73-79 brakes. Someone can correct me if not.
