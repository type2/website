&gt; My (professional) opinion on voltmeters:
&gt; 
&gt; Digital voltmeters are great. Very cheap and very accurate. I could
not do
&gt; without one. For basic electric work on a bus (you're right abot turn
&gt; signals!) an analog meter is very handy too. Having two meters is even
&gt; better than having just one.  So be a big spender and buy a digital
as well
&gt; as a (small)  analog meter.  I guess you can have both for a total
of about
&gt; $20.
&gt; 
&gt; About the ranging: You just set the rane to the nearest higher
setting from
&gt; what you expect. On a bus it means you set the analog meter most of
the time
&gt; to the 20 volts DC setting. This means full scale is 20 volts. Half
scale is
&gt; 10 volts etc.
&gt; 
&gt; Be careful. If you set it too low (like 5 volts) and you measure a
voltage
&gt; that is higher (like 12 volts) the needle will bang into the corner
and it
&gt; could bend making the voltmeter inaccurate er even damaging it.

This is what my HS electronics teacher referred to as &quot;Turning a meter
into a motor&quot;!

I keep a small digital meter in the parts box, along with my Heathkit
volt/dwell/tacho-meter.  The digital meter is just about
indestructable (as long as it is kept on the voltage settings) and can
take hard knocks.  The Heathkit has a huge analog meter that is very
handy for interpreting varying readings.  Since it is designed for
automotive use, it only has one voltage range (0-20v)

I also have a nice (almost antique) Simpson 270 analog VOM, with the
big analog meter, lotsa ranges, and even a nice mirror on the dial
that helps you correct for parallax error while reading the meter
(whoo whoo!)  I take it out of its leather case once in a while,
caress its knobs, and admire a product made by craftsmen!
