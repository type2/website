Subject: Re: [T2] Recharging Gel Cell Batteries

HI Mike,
	I have had good service from these folks.  I have two 800ma gel
cell automatic chargers for some scientific equipment we use (smaller
batteries)and I bought one of the BatteryMinders for my van's start
battery.  Seems to work well.  I have it hard wired and plug the van in
whenever I'm not using it.  Keeps the green LED lit on the Westfalia panel
and doesnt cause the battery to overcharge as far as I can see.
