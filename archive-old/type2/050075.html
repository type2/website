Subject: Re: [T2] Two Volkswagen camper

Just read your post about the two 74 Busses for sale and I'm pretty sure
this is outdated information since I bought the Orange one with the new
engine a little over a year ago.  I test drove both of them (in Memphis).
The Original Paint is scheduled to come off and new paint put on this
spring.  The White one had a little bit cleaner of an interior but some
definite shifting problems and an overall un-solid feel to it.  The Orange
one (affectionally called Bess by my wife) has had several improvements
since we bought it and is doing great.

By the way, John has some beautiful custom convertible bugs at Moonbugs.  It
was a pleasure doing business with him.

Until Later,

&gt;
&gt; Two (2) 1974 VW Campers... Each has a 2-litre engine, with: hydraulic
&gt; valves, sink, ice box, and pop top! Separately - one has a new engine
(with
&gt; zero miles), plus its original paint (orange with plaid interior); the
other
&gt; has new paint (white in color), with green plaid interior. Super cool!
&gt; PRICE: $4000. (or best offer)
