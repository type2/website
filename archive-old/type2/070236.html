Subject: Re: Seat Belts

&gt;I am wondering if you can help me.  I am looking for a VW camper bus, but 
&gt;my wife (with good reason) insists that there be seat belts for 5.  What 
&gt;year (if at all ) did they start putiing seat belts in for passengers.  I 
&gt;would appreciate any help or info.
