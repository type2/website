Subject: delay valve?

Can anyone inform me how to get hold of or home make the delay valve which
comes from the Carb - throttle damper - delay valve - carb, connected by
vacuum hose (air pipe).  I have a T2 1588cc transporter CT 1982.  The UK VW
part # is 060129412.  What does it do, where can I get one in the UK or how
can I bypass the whole system (if that is wise).

Richard
