Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Power loss update.

&gt; It pays to have a thick hide! What I find the most galling is when someone
&gt; desperately overtakes you and then settles in front slower than you were
&gt; going. :)
&gt;

There are two factors that go into that. And yes, at least twice a day that
happens to me.

#1: Busses have a reputation of being slow. Even if you're going faster than
everybody else.
#2: Busses are still tall vehicles. People hate being behind something they
can't see over.
