Subject: Re: [T2] Imported Brazillian Busses

Wonder if there is any way to set up dual residency in Costa Rica. You 
are permitted to drive your personal vehicle across  the borders for 
&quot;temporary&quot; visits

&gt; Last weekend I saw one of the new Brazilian Bay's with a WESTY-type 
&gt; setup in Davis, CA.  It had Costa Rica license plates on it. Appeared 
&gt; to look somewhat like my 78 Bay with a small &quot;nose &quot; on front for the 
&gt; radiator.  Sadly I lost it at a red light.
