&gt; PO broke one of the bleeder valves off.  I realized this as I 
&gt; was in the process of bleeding the system.
&gt; 
&gt; It's the Driver side rear, and I would welcome any advice. 
&gt; I would like to be able to unthread what's left of the valve,
&gt; and replace it without removing the wheel.  (I can't even get 
&gt; lug nuts off where it's parked, with the tools and muscle I have.)
&gt; (PO Obviously let a tire shop air wrench the lugs on...)


What a co-winky-dink, I broke that very one this morning.... Of
course, I was in the process of changing the wheel cylinders, so i use
the trusty hacksaw to cut mine off flush so that I could get a wrench
on the brake line...

But, this isn't what you had in mind.  How much of the bleeder screw
is left?  if is is just the bulbous tip that is missing [what seems to
be common on my vehicles], you may still be able to get a 7mm socked
on there and turn it out [I have even &quot;re-modified&quot; bleeder screws that
were badly stripped by driving a 6mm on....a definite one time
action].  If the bleeder is broke off too far in to get a socket of
vice-grips on it then my solution is either to turn a course threaded
screw into the chamber of the bleeder [making my threads as I go], or
to get the taps out and re-tap the whole, removing the remains of
bleeder as I go [I usually remove the wheel cylinder before this last
operation...sorry].

Before attempting any of this, I always evaluate the wheel cylinder to
see if it is really worth all of this to save...that is why this
morning I elected to use the hacksaw ;)

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Splits...Oh, my!
