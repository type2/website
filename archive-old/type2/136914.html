Subject: sliding door parts?????

Good day Volks,

Yesterday at lunch, my three year old daughter and I were sitting in 
the back eating lunch at Sonic and I noticed something I haven't for 
the 12 years I've owned the bus.  On the inside of the sliding door 
above the handle in front is a black bracket and to rear of the inside 
door is a protrusion that looks like it was a knob of some sort.  What 
did these components used to be?  Just really, really curious.  Can't 
believe I never questioned their  existence before!!  Oh the things I 
discover......
