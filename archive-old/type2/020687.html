&gt; I am going to start building a (custom) freeway flyer performance

&gt;
&gt; TRANSFORM, MOFOCO, Strickly Foriegn, John Maher, Bergmann, Audirac, Berg,
&gt; ewtc.... or any other PROFESSIONAL (long time in business... with a good
&gt; rep) that can do this.
&gt;
&gt; I lost some money a while back with one of our buddies on the list that took
&gt; a deposit from me, some oil, and up and hauled butt (family problems rumour
&gt; has it). Anyone heard from him lately ?
&gt;
&gt; The firm must be out in CA, as I will have it matched up to an engine
&gt; currently being built, and then it will all be shipped to me.
&gt;

I too was burnt that that internet trans wizard and went to Rancho and had mine
built up.  I have hearn nothing but good about them and not one complaint from
anybody.
