Not likely to work if it's a white, milky haze - the
haze is between the glass layers, and it would take a
hell of a lot of polishing to get down to that level!

&gt; Hey List -
&gt; 
&gt; As with most people, as the engine rebuild
&gt; progresses, I find lots of other
&gt; side projects for the bus. This one bugs me; my
&gt; windshield has a foggy halo
&gt; around the perimeter. I seem to remember reading
&gt; somewhere that rubbing it
&gt; with very fine steel wool followed by polishing with
&gt; newspaper would work
&gt; like a charm on this. For obvious reasons, I haven't
&gt; tried this yet and
&gt; won't until I get all y'all opinions. Am I crazy or
&gt; is my memory just going?
&gt; 
&gt; TIA!
