&gt;one side is wired to the ignition switch, so when the starter is cranked

&gt;thus the ONLY time the fuel pump gets power is either when the starter is
&gt;running or when the engine is running.... thus in an accident or stall the
&gt;fuel pump shuts off for safety


The safety shut off switch is in the AFM. When air stops flowing through
the motor and the flap closes, the pump is switched off. This has nothing
to do with the double relay. Get an inertia switch to wire into the ground
for the electric pump.
