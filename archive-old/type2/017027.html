Is Unca Joel still out there?  I haven't seen his weekly Friday postings
lately.  You know the ones, listing the numbers/types/years, et. al, of
all the
members by states and some cities and so forth.  Hey Joel, you out
there?  Any
details...

Alabama Pete in Boulder, CO and Kate the '78 Westy

&gt; I love these lists, hearing about trips, seeing busses for sale, listening

&gt; post, being interested in what is going on, but then at the end there is
&gt; only a name and a listing of VW's.
