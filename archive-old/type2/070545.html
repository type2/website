get it safe and roadworthy......drive it, thats where your fun will be.....

grab a few friends on a weekend , a compressor and an air sander....

sand it down, remove the stuff you do not want painted over and take it to 
Maaco, one day etc

they paint great, but they sand and mask horrible......

now you have a safe car thats all the same color !!!!!!!
