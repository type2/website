Subject: clean carbs

Question for y'all:

I'm having trouble getting my 72 to stay running.  She sat for four years
before I rescued her from behind a cycle shop. I cleaned out the fuel lines
and found that both carbs are getting sufficient gas to them but the engine
just won't go.  If I put some shots of gas in the carbs she'll start right up
but only for a second or two.  What's the best first step to take to try and
clean those carbs out?
