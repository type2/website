Subject: Re: Financial Report/Westy top(78) donation

Hi Group:

I've been away for awhile.  Glad to see that things are alive and 
well in Type 2 land.

I saw the above thread and feel an obligation to contribute.  I have 
a good condition Westy top off a 78 I parted last year that I don't 
want to store anymore.  I'll give it to the listee who wants it and 
will donate $100  (or what ever) to the list.  Can't ship it, but 
will help you install it on a moon roof style bus  (same 
configuration as my 77 I did 15 years ago).  It needs a new tent.
