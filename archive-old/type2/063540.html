&gt; 
&gt; One thing about being early or late in a production run: you may find
&gt; subtle differences between your bus and others of that year. For example,
&gt; some of your wiring may be a different color, or you may be missing some
&gt; features that came out later in the year.
&gt; 
&gt; Smile; be happy!

Joe and others,
My bus is an early '78, born in 11/77 (ok, so not as early as the other
guy's '66, but hey).  '78's were supposed to have sliding windows in the
middle position instead of the previous vent wings, but mine had the
vent wings :( .  So, I got some sliding windows and now it's a real '78
:) .  Of course, it's not original, but the vent wings were rusted to
crap anyway and the sliders are much better.
