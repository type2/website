Hi! I'm new to the list and have a few questions.  I've been a VW owner for
many years (mostly H2Os, and a Ghia),  I would like to purchase a Type 2
Westfalia.  I've seen a few of them and so far I like the later models
'77-'79.  Before making a decision I thought I'd ask the opinion of a few
fellow owners:  what should I be looking for and looking out for?  Are there
any hidden traps? Any help would be greatly appreciated!
The last one I looked at was a rusty '78 with 100000km on a rebuild engine,
with really good interior.

Andy
