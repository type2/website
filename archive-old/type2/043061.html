Until you try to back with the little roundie mirrors on a splitwindow.
If your mirrors are adaquate, I agree.  I was making an assumption
(incorrect, it turns out) on her use of the word &quot;Kombi&quot;.....assuming a
67&lt;...oh well.;)

Heh.  I did it when i parked the work trunk (nissan) the other day, too.
the guy in the passenger seat was in awe.

I'd never parallel'd a bus until i moved to KC, where i had to do it every
day...it was just a natural motion to put it in that way, instead. I think
the short nose and tight turn circle helps in this. (prior to there i
rarely ever had to parallel..)

I still park the quantum &quot;normally&quot; most of the time...
