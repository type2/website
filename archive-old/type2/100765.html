Subject: misspelling Volkswagen and other words

Folks,

In my recent contributions to the list you surely have noted many errors and
misspelled words. I will make an effort to take the time to reread my posts
and correct such things in future emails. I think that I am just so happy to
have some time to reply to the list, that I mash the send button hastily.
Also I just noticed that the new sign on our door and the business cards
have Volkswagen spelled with an &quot;o&quot;.
