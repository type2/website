&gt;i need the part number for the gaskets on the rear cab windows. each side,
&gt;one being the 3rd door, has a vent window adjacent to a stationary window.
&gt;two gaskets are used: one on the vent, another on the stationary glass. i
&gt;need part numbers for both, and all four if they are lefts and rights.

I can't help you with the part nos but I am almost positive that
those rubbers for the fixed portion of the window are NLA and haven't
been for some time,however I'd certainly be happy to be proved wrong.
As it happens I have several of those rubbers (R &amp; L)somewhere in one
of my sheds (and the glass) that I don't intend to re-use.
They are naturally used but re-usable if need be.If you get desperate,
lemme know and we'll work out something...

&gt;there has been mention that the vent rubber is different from the bus
&gt;middle window wing vent. numbers would tell all. 

Yes I've heard that too however I have managed to mate up a middle
window wing vent from a microbus to the fixed portion of the DC side 
window.I couldn't see the logic in VW making different parts that are
so similar for vans and double cabs.It made more sense to use a common
part,but I'm not sure if these are available new anymore either.
I did this before I went another way,as detailed below...

I always found the wing vents in double cabs a real PITA as they got
old and inevitably leaked,shortening the life of many a good double
cab as water ends up sitting under the rear seat (from a variety of
sources incl. the wing vents) and owners often never bothered to
check for water untill it was too late and serious rust was present.
I hope you can find all the parts you will need in good nick but
I chose an alternative that you may wish to consider if you can't...

&gt;From '77 on till the end of the DC model in '79 VW dispensed with the
wing vent and went to a one piece of fixed glass and single rubber.
Are these parts still available? Not a chance however there is another
way to achieve the same thing...

By some quirk of fate,the rubber for the rear side window of
an early Beetle is exactly the right size to fit in the window
opening of the double cab ('68-'79) and since the glass needed
is dead flat,you can have some cut to size.
The rubber is about 1 or 2 mm wider than the original but makes no
noticable difference when installed and they are cheap!

The rubber you would need is the WCM Cal look type and I think the 
part no is 111-321A and is described as:
Seal,Qtr Window,Cal Look Bug 52-64 

I don't have the dimensions of the glass with me but do at home
so if you are interesed (or anybody else is) email me and I'll
get them off the hardboard template of the window I made.
This is what I have done in my '76DC and it worked fine,and still does.

The advantages are no leaks,new cheap still available parts and a 
smoother look to the side of the vehicle.
Disadvantages are reduced ventillation to rear seat and not strictly
stock for &quot;68-'76 DCs.
I solved the ventillation problem however by fitting the ventillation
system from a microbus that runs along the front doors and provides
air to rear passengers via the round vents.Works pretty good and of
course,you can always wind down the front windows :)

Not really the answers to the questions you posed but hopefully food
for thought if you get stuck...
