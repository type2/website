Subject: [T2] Where to carry extra keys

&gt;NOOOO!!! Not the extra set of keys!
&gt;
I was working on site at a D*w Ch*emical plant once, and one of our
engineers (an engineer no less  : )  ) locked the keys in the company car.
Their locksmith got it open, but recommended we do what he said he does:
pop rivet an extra key through the body in an out of the way place.  You
have to figure out how to pry it off the body, but those rivets don't put up
much of a fight.

I kind of don't want to start a thread on where to hide keys:  prying eyes
are everywhere.  But there are lots of places to put them.  Most car thieves
are in a hurry.  Just keep it inconvenient.
