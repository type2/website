Subject: 79 Exhaust

Hello all

I thought I posted this several days ago, but it never came through,
not at least to me.  So I'm posting it again.  So if it pops up twice,
sorry.

Several months ago I advertised a 79 California exhaust system for sale
complete.  At the time several people were interested however they were
hesitant, not having ever see it before.  Which I completely understand.

Well I now have pictures of it for anyone still interested.

What I can tell you

The good
Works well, came off a 79 california engine which was dying now dead
No holes, or significant rust.
Complete system, from heads out, including cat converter and O2 sensor,
which works

The bad
It appears to have several places where parts are welded together.  All
places can be seen in photos.
left  heat  exchanger to muffler
cross over pipe to y-tube.
Left side collection tube, coming out of heads, appears to have a weld
repair.

Otherwise it works great.  I'd recommend bolting it right on as is.

I'm asking $150 plus shipping.  I know it works well.  I ran the engine
in my garage for several weeks before I took it off.
If not sold this way I'll take off whatever you want.

P-mail me for pics.  There are 5 about 50K each in jpg format.
