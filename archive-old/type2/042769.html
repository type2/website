Subject: Re: Sump Oil Temp Sender

&gt;&gt;you can not install a sending unit into the sump and get an accurate

of oil temps. You are simply measuring the temperature of the edge of the
sump and the oil there (that is NOT moving and passing thru the engine
rapidly). Mounting the sending unit on the suction side of the pump in the
main oil
galley is a good spot, but requires some work.&gt;&gt;

This is what we've since found out. Unfortunately, in the Bus Depot catalog
it was 'recommended'
over the dipstick one.  *sigh*
