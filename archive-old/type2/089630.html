Subject: Re: [T2] I weighed my bus

This is the reason for problems getting correct tires for the westies.  
Standard 14 inch tires do not meet the load requirement.  It must be 92 
load rated.  Note that when you go to 15 inch tires with the new 
minimums for dot a while back most basic 15 inch tires meet the 
requirements plus a lower profile (65 vs 75).  Then the problem of 
wheels that will work.   Read the wheel manufacturers notes carefully.  
I have found that most 15&quot; rims with conservative patterning (more metal 
less hole) will work if in the new audi pattern.

&gt; The bus weighed in at 3500 lbs (w/two spare tires and me on board).

&gt; Front axle was 1640 lbs.
&gt; Rear axle was 1860 lbs.
&gt;
&gt; Not to start another tire thread, but my rear tire is &quot;C&quot; load rated for
&gt; 1433 lbs.  It's 6 ply but not reinforced in the sidewall.  Since it 
&gt; only has
&gt; to bear ~930 lbs it would seem a &quot;D&quot; rated is overkill but since the D 
&gt; tires
&gt; are usually 8 ply I understand why people choose them.
&gt;
&gt; The age of my rear tires must factor greatly in their inability to 
&gt; handle
&gt; the bus in the crosswinds.
&gt;
&gt; Seems the Continental CR21RF tires that Nemo found are the way to go.
