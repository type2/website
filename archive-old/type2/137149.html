Subject: alternatives for an EGR filter for an '80 Federal Vanagon?

I've tried unsuccessfully to find a new/replacement EGR canister filter 
for my Federal '80 Vanagon to get it through emissions check.

I haven't found anyone who actually had the one for the Federals.
(I did find the Calif. one but it wouldn't work without some 
modifications that are beyond me at this time.  Besides I don't know if 
the actual filter is the same or not.)

Anyone come up with any sort of retro fit that works and provides the 
appropriate effect?
