Subject: Re: [T2] WAS:  More tranny help

Will,
Unfortunately when I removed my tranny I noticed a hole in my bell housing
so that option was not open to me and I had to use the one on the new
tranny.

As for the Airs update in SC.
The Bus was repaired Twice in the town in broke down in, made it almost 80
miles to Columbia where the engine overheated and bus engine is dead.  Bus
is still there.  Laura made it home by way of rental car to NC.

That's the last I have heard.

Snoopy
