Subject: 15w40 or 10w30 for fall/winter?

okay now, i live in north carolina where the summers are hot and winters are
mild MOST of the time. i was going to use 10w30, but a listmember reccommended
using 15w40 instead....it sometimes gets down to 15F and sometimes (Rarely)
below. mostly around 25-32F is the coldest we get. any ideas?
