&gt;I am rebuilding a set over carbs for my '73 bus.  I am curious about what
&gt;to use to clean them.  Someone told me to buy carb cleaner in a gallon can
&gt;and soak the carb in it for 2 or 3 days.  I have easy access to gallons of
&gt;paint thinner, would this work just as well?  What about the brass
&gt;fixtures, does carb cleaner or thinner harm these?  Any suggestions or
&gt;wisdom.

I don't think thinner will hurt any of the parts but it won't cut the
grease like carb cleaner.  I'd just get some cans of Berryman Chemtool
spray carb cleaner in the red white and blue cans (Berryman is the best -
don't bother with cheaper brands) and spray them out real well.  No need to
soak for days, IMO.

&gt;Also, I need a good carb kit.  I rebuilt my carbs last year with a kit
&gt;from Bus Depot.  These kits, although of good quality, have very few parts
&gt;and are made to work on several different carbs.  I want a high quality
&gt;overhaul kit, not just a gasket kit.  Any one know where I can get one for
&gt;32/34 PDSIT-2 dual carb from a '73?

Vee Parts in San Diego sells the kits, 619-477-4787, but they are probably
the same as what the Bus Depot has.  Maybe they can tell you.
