Subject: Re: [T2] Ignition switch trouble

&gt;My guess is that the part of the assembly that makes the electrical 
&gt;contact has arced or corroded over the years and is now not making a good 
&gt;contact.  This is one of the few areas of my bus that I have never 
&gt;explored - back when someone broke into my bus and stole it back around 
&gt;1990, the ignition wires were cut and the lock damaged and rather than try 
&gt;to repair it I swapped in a whole 'nuther steering column from a '74 (I 
&gt;think) bus.  At this stage in my life I have less access to junkyard parts 
&gt;and would rather try to repair the problem if possible.
&gt;
&gt;So, anyone had this problem before?  I could use some advice.

My beetle went through this very problem. It had a small nylon plastic 
contact plate that had tiny nylon knobs that gets pushed down by the back 
of the ignition lock. Eventually these little knobs wear down so that when 
they are pushed inwards towards the electrical contacts they can't make 
contact. Wiggling the key helps push the knob a little further in and this 
fixes it for a while.

Your only solution is to replace the ignition switch.

Seems like I may have disassembled mine and mated a new electrical contact 
with the old lock. Been about 10 years... This isn't a part that is 
supposed to be disassembled - it involves bending tabs and drilling out 
rivets I'm sure on the switch housing. Now if you go the replacement switch 
route you can just expect to drill out the rivets that hold the assembly to 
the steering column.
