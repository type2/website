Subject: What does a Voltage regulator do?

What exactly does a voltage regulator do?

I originally thought that it took whatever the altergator/generator was 
putting out and kicked out a constant, clean 12v. 

That doesn't appear to be the case.

I'm reading about 13.3v up front when the engine is running.

Are things like car radios and other accessories able to handle variable 
voltages? 

Thanks,
...Markus
