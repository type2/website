&gt; This is important to mention when folks says it fits because there are several

The body is the same size on all the new Mallory VW distributors, afaik. It
is only the advance mechanism and points/unilite plates that differ.

&gt; The Mallory while flexible to config, can the configuration even come close to
&gt; the stock curve? Has anyone who has done the install tried to prove it?

Honestly Richard, I believe you are over thinking this. If I were building a
car for the race track I might examine tuning to this degree, but for my bus
I am happy to get it running well, close to original specs, consistently and
reliably. I have about 20k miles with zero maintenance or adjustment to the
ignition system to say that this product works well. Does the advance come
in too soon? I don't honestly know and I don't think it matters very much to
the drivability of the bus. I have made enough other modifications to the
engine (camshaft, CR, ignition system) that any attempt to duplicate exactly
the factory advance curves would probably be a waste of effort. Could I make
the engine perform a bit better with more tuning of the distributor advance
curve? Perhaps, but this sort of tuning can often be a battle of diminishing
returns.

I am not sure if you are trying to prove that this product works well, or
disprove it. We don't sell Mallory distributors, so I have nothing to gain
from saying they work great, but they do. The only distributor that might be
better is an NOS Bosch original. And like I said, the only way to test the
distributor effectively is either on test bed or dyno situation, and neither
one is available to most people, myself included. So I just drive it, watch
the gauges a little and not worry.
