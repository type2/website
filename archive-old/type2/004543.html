Subject: 1980 Westy questions

Hello,

First off I have posted something to this email earlier. My email program
has decided I needed to clean out all my folders and has deleted all my
email and addresses. If you have replied previously please feel free to do
so again :) as I don't have your email address or prior responses.

I have purchased a 1980 Deluxe Westy.... 149k blows blue smoke...runs,  4
different sized tires (standard right) manual transmission, worn and tired.
Price was right, very right.  I am looking to solve the following problems.
1. Need to pass emissions here in Washington.  Any suggestions on how to
pass an emissions test in a Air-cooled Vanagon?
2. Need to have the motor looked at to determine if a full rebuild is in
order or if it is something that can be fixed.
3. Need to have the rest of the van looked at to determine anyother major
concerns.

Does anyone recommend a shop in the N. Seattle area? that has time...the few
I have called have been too busy to take me. Does anyone want to look at
this themselves to help out a new owner and provide pearls of wisdom?

Any and all comments will be appreciated thanks in advance...

Scott
