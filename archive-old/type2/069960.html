&lt;&lt;T2s need to use BOSCH W6AC plugs because the engine works harder and hotter 
pushing the load of the bus.

Maybe I missed something in this thread, but the heat of the plugs refers to the 
operating temp of the plugs tip; its ability to shed combustion heat and maintain 
a temp below the point of spontanious combustion of the fuel.&gt;&gt;

And, it has to reach the 'self-clean' temperature that allows the plug to burn
itself clean, if the plug is used in lower than spec temp environments it will
foul etc.
