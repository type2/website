Subject: Re: [T2] staplers for canvas

&gt; We arein the process of doing a late model canvas in the shop and the old
 stapler isn't cutting it. What kind of stapler is best suited for this
 task(read as is there a stapler that will kill me if I use it wrong?)

The only one I found that would do it is an operated one. I tried all the hand operated ones but they did not
get it. The electric ones were a joke also.
The cheapo one from Harbor Freight works. But you need a compressor.

I was never able to locate stainless steel staples to match the originals....
