Subject: RE:57 DoubleDoorPanel FS Now In JPEG Form

The .art file is an Aol thing and it can be converted as some have done ,
but when posting pics one should provide a format which your normal people
not using aol can access.  I did the aol thing for a few years  till i
learned better.  Jpg is the most used and can be seen if posted rite on all
computers, they opened fine for me in IE6 , but the mac boys might not have
been able to get to them. I use this viewer for most graphics and its a
great little deal  ck it out here  http://www.irfanview_dot_com/ opens dang near
anything. just my .02 cents worth
