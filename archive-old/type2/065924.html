I keep tellin y'all! 
Without going into my typical multi-paragragh diatribe let me simply note
that the '67 Westy Resto from Hell spent 21 months and $5,100.00 at &quot;Camp
Dietzler.&quot; As I check around, I got off rather &quot;modestly&quot; compared to some
projects. The pace of the laborer was slow but he did do a very nice job.

BTW: &lt;price includes inside and outside of the completely stripped shell,
bumpers, six wheels (in case one or more ended up bent at mounting time) and
reworking of the poptop.&gt; I am finally getting over the &quot;bitter&quot; stage as
the bus comes together! The bus is turning out really nicely! =)
