Just when you thought your bus fun for the winter was to repaint that dingy
tinware...

I've been tossing arounf the idea of putting together an informal winterbus
campout. The dates would be Jan 15,16 &amp; 17. The location is still up in the
air but I am looking at Hanging Rock State Park,NC or Roaring Gap, NC. A few
local folks have expressed some interest but I would also like to hear from
listmembers that would be interested in attending as well. 

Never been camping before. Well there is no better time. Ask Santa to bring
you a 20 degree bag and a lantern for X-mas. Pack some sandwhiches and hit
the road. 

Don't have a camper. No problem. Leave that middle seat at home and sleep on
the cargo floor.  Tents work too. 

Worried about the cold. You already drive a bus so you should be used to
that:)&gt;

Please send me an e-mail if you would like to attend. I will keep you posted
as plans develope.
