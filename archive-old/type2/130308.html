Subject: Re: [T2] New Rings on Old Pistons?

&gt;Since I'm pulling the cylinders off to clean the outside, deck 
&gt;volume, and piston tops, I was curious what the conventional 
&gt;wisdom is about using the old rings vs. replacing them with new 
&gt;ones.  The old ones only have 25,000 miles on them -- do they 
&gt;really need to be replaced?

When I removed/repaired/reinstalled the heads on my 914 last fall the
decision was made for me when I broke a ring.  Personallly, I'm happy this
happened because the Deves rings (thanks www.aircooled_dot_net !) that I
installed have made a noticeable difference in power for this motor with 40k
miles on the rebuild.
