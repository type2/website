So I found a roof rack but im not sure it is from a bus - i was told it
came off of a 70's bus and it fits nicely on my 60?

Anyway, it appears as tho im missing some sort of clamps - does anyone
have any pics of what these things look like - ive seen roof racks in
pics that look very much like mine - but - anyway - info as to clamps
and roof racks would be appreciated
-  --  - --  -
on most rack racks the clamps are missing, unfortunately.   What I did was buy
turnbuckles from the hardware store.   One end (that hooks under the rain
gutter) I gruound so it was flat instead of a hook, so it would fit.  Le
voila!.   Not so great if you are worried about you paint job, but very
functional, rack hasn't fallen off in years
