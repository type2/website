Subject:  69Westy for sale in WA

I had a call the other day from Steve at Carter &amp; Son VW in Chehalis, WA.  He 
was wanting to sell a 69 pop top westy, had bought it w/ dead motor and 
swapped a good used motor into it.   Runs, drives, stops, turns.  No 
significant dents or rust.  It is blue, he said the paint polished up nice.  
New tires on it.
Told me he wants $1200.  sounds like a deal.

  I have not seen it, call him, dont email me.

The number is (360)748-3008
