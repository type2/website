Subject: Moisture problem 

Hello All,
I have been having a moisture problem with my 81' vanagon 2000 motor.  There 
seems to be moisture getting into my oil and foaming it up.  In the last 
three weeks I have had to change my oil twice because the foam was showing 
up in large amounts on my dipstick.  It seems to have started since the 
temperature has been dropping below freezing at night and everything frosts 
up.

During the spring, I modified the engine and switched it from fuel injection 
to carburated.  Swapped out the distributor and put electronic ignition in 
it and have had few adjustments to make since.  The only thing that we did 
not know how to finish off was the crank case breather valve at the top of 
the motor.  What I was told is that I could not block this off because it 
relieves excess pressure that builds up in the crank case, blocking this off 
would blow my seals.  We just left it hang and I never had a problem until 
recently.  When I checked everything over, I found water built up in the 
hose.  Cleaned everything up, changed the oil, and created a filter out of a 
soup can, an old air filter, and duct tape which I fitted over the end of 
the hose.  The foam is still showing up.  Anyone have any ideas as to what 
might be causing this and how I can correct it.  What is the best way to get 
the moisture out of my motor? is there an additive I can use to help clean 
it out?  Any help would be great.  Thank you

The eggman
