Subject: single to dual craperators (long)

  Since we are still on the subject of carbs,  I have been thinking about 
changing my 71 DP from a 34 stock carb, to duals.  I ordered a brand new 
carb from a well known supplier.  For some strange reason, I thought it 
would be a Solex.  Instead, I recieved a Bocar.  I can tend to be a little 
anal about non-German parts on my engine, unless they are well made.  I try 
to stay away from Brasil, and Mexican parts, although I own a 69,  and many 
of my parts unless NOS, can only be bought new from these places.  I am 
wondering about dual Kadrons.  From what I have seen, and read, the Webbers 
are a pain in the but. Especially the progressives.  Someone suggested 
Kadrons to me.  Some of the things I would like to know are;  Is the Kadron 
a quality carb?  Where is it made?  Do the have pre-heater tubes, chokes?  
What size for a stock motor?  I helped a friend put dual carbs on his 327 
Chevy truck.
One thing we had to do, was to keep the cfm's to a minimum for each carb, so 
we did not have to change the cam, or go with different valves in the heads. 
  I believe we used two 325 cfm four barrels, bringing it up to 650 cfm's 
with two.  The original four barrel he had put on it was that by itself.   
Is there any mods necessary with the 1600 DP?  And, BTW, what is thought 
about the stock fuel delivery system?  If I stick with that, I will want to 
restore my center manifold, as the preheater tube is clogged up with stuff.  
I know this is alot of questions, but anyone feel free to take a stab.
