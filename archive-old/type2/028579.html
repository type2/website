I will be replacing my gas tank shortly.  What else besides the filler hose, vent hose and fuel line should I need?  I have to get this done quickly and don't want to pull everythiing apart only to realize that i should have bought this,that and the other and then wait several weeks to receive it all.  I know there is always something that &quot;always&quot; needs to be replaced that isn't in the manuals, so anybody who has done this recently, help a brother out.  Also, any advise or tricks for pulling this thing would be greatly appreciated as well.
Thanks
Mike Edwards
