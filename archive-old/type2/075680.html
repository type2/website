Subject: Re: [T2] Heating possiblities

Let's see here.....47 amps for less than 3000btu. Note that the BN-4 heater 
for the late Baywindow busses was rated at 16k btu, _at_ 3.1 amps. The Biggest 
alt. you could get on any Baywindow was 70amp. If you know what you're doing, 
you can build that to 90amp.(as I've done with mine). But that rating is for 
a duty cycle of about 7%, _at_ temp. of 47deg. f. With a stock 55amp. alt., at 
temps above freezing, you can count on about 17-20amps continuos output. And 
that is being kind. Electric heat for VW's has been discussed to death. 
Unless you've got a Westy, and are plugged into shore power, forget it. Get a 
gas or vented propane furnace, and be warm, just like the engineers at the 
factory intended.
