Agreed. The shift linkage from shift knob to trans is something I have done
battle with on every bus I've owned from 65-79. Unlike engine diagnosis, I
find this to be one area to just throw (good) parts at untill you nail it
down. New couplers, new bushings (that fit), lots of grease, just go over
everything as a system. Patience under the bus.

Thanks Billy this is just what i did took the advice and ran with it....

muchos gracious hombre

Thank you all.... 

its fixed.... 
dont know what it exaclty if one thing or many things, but its fixed and feels brand new...shifting going down the road or sitting still gears are so much closer together and the tranny feels saweeeeetttttt~!~ 

i have with ease 1-4 + reverse no troubles... 

beck and I replaced the front shift rod,front shift rod bushing,rear coupler,along with shifter and stop plate changed so thats alot new to make it all work purdy again........ 

i, it would only of had to of been the tranny or one of the bushings from the inside tube for shift rod which would have taken a engine/tranny drop i wasnt up for... everything else is replaced now..... 
 

again theres no telling what it was the good thing now is it shifts better than it ever has in our ownership .... 

thanks to all those that tried to give a suggestion on this.. 
i had no choice but to replace all that i could to make it right... 
the stop plate was a real issue here and can cause a mess out of adjustment. 

i also believe my shift rod was a little bent as well i noticed when i took my old shift coupler off...? shift coupler boots were pretty shot as well... 

there wasnt even a front bushing at all on the front shift rod and the front shift rod looked to be bent also along with the cup at the front of it was worn badly and expanded more than the other one i now have on it.. so someone has really done some ruffing on this bus or that is what got put there... 

LET's All never forget this was a Back From The Dead bus and well that should say enough about it for anyone that remembers that place in asheville.... 

good people bad business..... 

the coupler wasnt that bad but the shift rod had to be bent back up right with the best elbowing i could....would of replaced it hadnt not been for a engine drop..... 

once again thanks 

as much as i wanted to go give up and b**ched and wined i countlessly did not let it( shifting problem) win.... i am worn out and took all weekend to fix it all with the heat etc.... but can get down the road again.... 
that bicycle has been about the death of me... its just to hot right now this time of year better off being
