Subject: Re: [T2] remanufactured half axles reliability??

&gt; Considering that the life of CV joints is usually over 100K miles

&gt; 
&gt; I'm a bit suspicious of the idea of &quot;remanufacturing&quot; CV joints.  Sounds
&gt; to me like they are taking old axles, keeping the OK CVs, and making up
&gt; the deficit with new CVs.  Could be a good deal, could be a
&gt; failure in
&gt; 1000 miles.


I'll enter an experienced disagreement here.

Back when I was in the business, I probably installed 25 or 30 
remanufactured halfshafts.  VW, Toyota, American stuff...  Never had a 
failure.  Never.
