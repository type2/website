Subject: Re: [T2] Mirror measurements request

From: &quot;andy&quot; &lt;andy_at_pon.type2_dot_com&gt;
&gt; A - 6 3/8&quot; as you have it drawn.
&gt; B - 4 5/8&quot;
&gt; C - 1 3/8 center to center.
&gt; D - 1 1/8 on the short side (top) like 3/32 longer on the lower side due
&gt; to the angle.

Ah ha, I wasn't sure of the angle, thanks.

&gt; E sort of... The older mirror has an oval mounting head 2 1/8 wide by 1
&gt; 1/8 high. the screws are centered vertically.

I'm going to try to make the bayonet-style head work as both a b-style and
as the screw-style mount.  Do the screw holes leave the screws exposed
(heads showing), or do the heads of the screws recess into the screw holes?

Thanks for the info, Andy.  With the measurements I'll be able to match the
length of the stock long stem mount.  Creating a working adjuster on the
bumper thingy will be interesting, but I've got a good idea how to do it.
