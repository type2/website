Subject: Re: Sandblasting

     A local sandblaster just told me, when I was inquiring about having
a car done, that  you really don't want to &quot;sand&quot; blast any vehicle,
that you need to use plastic pellets -- can't remember the precise name
of them -- and he recommended I go to another local shop who did that. I
think they also use ground corn cobs for that.
