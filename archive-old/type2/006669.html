It seems sun fading is to some degree a problem with most any fabric you
might use.

We've tried everything from plain yarn-died cotton to various synthetic
fabrics for curtains in VW campers and boats, and they've all faded markedly
in a couple of years.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  When you install new curtains, be sure not to repeat my mistake.

WASH YOUR CURTAINS IN COLD WATER BEFORE INSTALLING THEM.

This will set the dye and make them much less susceptible to the UV
DAMAGE/FADING that will occur in very short order.

Ask me how I know.  I ruined my brand new curtains, the dye has already
faded noticeably in 1.5 years.

It probably wouldn't be a bad idea to try and find some type of product that
purports to protect fabric against UV damage, either.  I just don't know if
an effective one is available.  &lt;&lt;
