Subject: Yes, Another hubcap question...

Hello List,

Here is a question that I know I am going to get
glares for. I am sure dozens of people have asked this
but will a pre 1971 hubcap fit on a late model bus
that usually has the flat hubcap style? I looked in
the archives with several different key words but
couldn't find what I was looking for. Has anyone tried
to fit an early hubcap on a late bus rim? I like the
look of the early hub cap style about as much as I
like the look of the 68-72 bus bumpers. Thanks for
humoring me. Have a great day!

David Kelly
