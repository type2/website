&gt;Subject: [T2] heat exchanger &quot;rebuilding&quot;
&gt;Date: Tue, 30 Apr 2002 23:08:14 -0700 (PDT)
&gt;
&gt;Hello List,
&gt;
&gt;I thought I would write about what I am doing to my
&gt;heat exchangers. Before I pulled my engine I removed
&gt;both heat exchangers. They were in pretty rough shape.
&gt;They have rusted apart from the header pipes inside
&gt;them. There are also a couple or more rust holes in
&gt;them. Well, I took a handy flat screw driver and
&gt;hammer and pried each heat exchanger apart at the
&gt;seams. I them cleaned each piece and bead blasted the
&gt;inside and outside of the heat exchanger sheet metal
&gt;as well as the pipes them selves. Today I ordered 2
&gt;pints of the manifold grey , high temp (1400 F) Por 15
&gt;as well as the 20oz bottle of the metal prep. Over the
&gt;next few days, I plan to weld in pieces of sheet metal
&gt;to sew up all of the holes that the rust left behind.
&gt;I will POR 15 each piece and crimp them back together.
&gt;I will then put a coat on the outside after I finish
&gt;up the tack welding. After all this is done, I will
&gt;probably buy some exhaust seam sealer and go over all
&gt;the seams to make sure that the air goes where it is
&gt;suppose to. All in all, I will have spent less than
&gt;$40.00 apiece making them functional again. If I can
&gt;get them to last a few years than I feel that I have
&gt;not wasted my time or money. Any way, I just thought I
&gt;would share.
&gt;
&gt;Have a great day!
&gt;David Kelly
