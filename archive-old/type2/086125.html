Subject: RE: [T2] Popping noises and lack of power

&gt; Check!  I have not seen an aftermarket exhaust that will accept a
&gt; catalytic converter, and you need that to be legal in CA. Unfortunately,
&gt; for the next two years (until the bus reaches 25 years) you will need a
&gt; stock system.


On that note, as an aside to Virginia residents,  I recently read in an
industry trade paper that in Virginia, vehicles over 25 years old will soon
be exempted from emissions inspection.  This means that most (and in a few
years, all) busses will be exempt.  Previously the cutoff was 1968.
