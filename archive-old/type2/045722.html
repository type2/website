&gt; Aircooled Type 2 vehicles can have one of two engines. Through 1971 (US

&gt; Type 4 engine. These are larger than Type 1 engines (smallest Type 4 engine
&gt; is 100cc larger than the largest Type 1 engine--1776s made in someone's
&gt; garage do not count here), they're more robust, and the cooling system is
&gt; way, way different.

and they are MUCHO heavier, be prepared if your taking it out they are
both wider and heavier.
