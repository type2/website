X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Hello all,
  I am going to pick up a 79 Westy that all I want is the engine and trans.
The rest of it is your free for the taking. NO I will not part it out, I
will deviler in the Tacoma area though.
  It is a 1979 Westy Delux. It has a stove, sink, fridge, and z-bed. The
Pop-top is there and mechanicly good shape, needs cleaning and some repair
to the fabric(or replacement) Body is fair, but no rust. The nose is real
nice with only one small dent near the turn signal. Has some minor dents on
both sides and one big dent below the right rear side marker. All damage is
easily fixed. Color is cream with brown plaid interior. 
  I am buying it for the engine/trans to put into another Bus. So it will
not have either, but everything else will be there.
  Its location is Tacoma Wa. Price is FREE.
I need to know if there are any interested parties as I need to move on this
one soon. I may have pictures availible tomorrow.
You can call me at work (253)-984-9270 or after 5 at home (253)-846-2004.
