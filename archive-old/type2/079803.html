Hi all,

When I bought my bus the first thing the PO taught me was that there was 
indeed a &quot;proper waving etiquette&quot;.  He said that when you are driving down 
the road and you see another bus (bay or splitty) you must stick your whole 
arm as far out the window as possible and wave at him while honking the horn 
(assuming it works lol).  If you happen to see a vanagon, you wait for him 
to wave first, and if he does, then you return the gesture but not with 
quite as much enthusiasm as you would for an earlier bus.  The same protocol 
applies to the older bugs.  But he was very clear that you are to completely 
ignore both the newer bugs and the Euro vans.  Well I thought that whole 
concept was pretty clever but I agree with whoever said that it doesn't 
matter what vehicle you drive.  Lets just say that as long as you are 
driving an air-cooled vw.... I got your back!!

Oh yah, something else he mentioned is that if you ever see another Type 2 
parked someplace you should: 1) park next to it, 2) go into the store and 
try to find the owner (which is usually obvious) 3) start a conversation by 
asking one of two questions.... Question #1 what year is it?, and then 
Question #2 what other busses do/have you owned besides/before this one?

I think the best part of owning a bus is knowing that everybody helps 
everybody, which is pretty encouraging when you consider the day and age 
that we are living in. What goes around comes around...Keep it real :)
