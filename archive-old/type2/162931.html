Subject: rapid response to low oil-P

&gt;  I conclude that when the oil-P warning light comes on, you should 
&gt;stamp  -  possibly even stomp  -   down the clutch pedal.

	One response was to prefer switching off the ignition as a 
higher priority.
	I don't follow this reasoning.  If metal is getting so hot 
from sliding past other metal with too little oil that it's about to 
melt, ceasing to burn fuel doesn't seem the highest priority, does 
it?  I reckon the top priority is to stop the motor turning  -  stop 
that metal moving.  Declutching is the first step to that end.
	You can then change into neutral and coast to a stop.
	If you alternatively keep the motor turning, but merely cease 
producing heat of combustion, seizure could well ensue within 50 yd.
