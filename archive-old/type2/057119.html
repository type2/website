Subject: Re: Thermostats...

 I have various good used thermostats and noticed 
&gt;that some have stamped into them what I believe is a  temperature 
&gt;degree range.  Some have 65-70 degrees ranges, while others 
&gt;have 75-80 degree ranges.  Does anyone have info that explains 
&gt;which (or what other) thermostat is correct for what engines?  

The only breakdown of this that I know of is Type 1 thermostats versus 
Type 4 thermostats.  The cooler (70 degrees C) thermostats are for the 
Type 1 engine and the hotter (80 degrees C) thermostats are for the Type 
4.  They are not interchangeable, i.e. you can't put a Type 4 thermostat 
on a Type 1, it just won't work (the method of attachment to the flaps 
is different).  The Type 1 thermostats have a relatively long internally 
threaded protrusion sticking out from the top while the Type 4 
thermostats have a smaller externally threaded post on top.
