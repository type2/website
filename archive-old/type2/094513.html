Subject: Re: [T2] Hose for external oil cooler - keeps spliting

[...]
Or if your in an area with heavy performance shops (i.e. shops that 
specialize in supplying racers).
I usually go to such a shop in my area for  all my hose stuff for 
coolers and sometimes fuel lines, etc.  Several of the manufacturers of 
kits for tranny and oil coolers even state not to use heater hose which 
is often recommended by people at flaps (not me)..

&gt; They may be selling you heater core hose and not real oil rated hose.
