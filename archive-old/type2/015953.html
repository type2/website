O.K. Volks the Bounty's gett'n a little loud, and a little smokey when I
turn on the heat; although it doesn't seem to matter much after the first
few minutes, the world is a warm, and fuzzy place...

Busboys sells an extractor setup for about 120, and heater boxes for about
$100 each...the stock exhaust is of similar price, and available through
the Bus Depot.  The Bus Depot lists an &quot;Extractor&quot; of some sort, for about
$58 but doesn't say much more about than that, and doesn't seem to respond
to my e-mail very well, probably swamped.

So who's got some experience with these products, and what's recommended.
I am somewhat worried about aftermarket stuff since more than a couple I've
seen tend to smog in the back hatch...a problem I've not had with my
battered stock set-up.

Have at it thee list-gods...I case ya don't know the Bounty is a '71.
