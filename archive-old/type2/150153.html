&gt; I have a California model 1982 Vanagon Westy. I am confused about  
&gt; distributor rotor nos.  Some online vendors list rotors that fit  
&gt; &quot;any stock VW from '59 onward&quot; ,

It's because most of the rotors fit most of the distributors.

&gt; usually the Bosch number 1 234 332 215/04 033.  Others list the 1  
&gt; 234 332 300/04 038 rotor for all vanagons regardless of federal or  
&gt; Calif.   Bentley clearly shows a Calif. rotor is supposed to be  
&gt; 1000 ohms resistance, while federal is 4000 - 6000 ohms, so there  
&gt; would have to be 2 different Vanagon rotors.

Right.

04033 has the 5kohm resistor under the black epoxy.
04038 has the 1kohm resistor AND the tip is much wider.

&gt; All this is probably mute for me as I am installing a CDI system  
&gt; and must remove the resistance from the rotor anyway.  But, is  
&gt; there a PHYSICAL interchangeability issue between these rotors?
&gt; The distributor is part no.039 905 205C.

Either will fit.

You'll find that the 1kohm rotor will suffice when running CDI (at  
least it won't burn out quickly like the 5 kohm rotor will).

Removing all of the resistance will help but I can't say how much  
because it depends on the rest of your wiring, etc.

I was thinking of doing a group buy for 0 kohm rotors from Germany.  
Prices probably have changed since I last looked at them but $11 (inc  
ship) was the ballpark figure for a factory rotor vs. $30 + ship for  
one cut open to remove the original resistor.

Send me a pm and if enough people are interested I'll figure out the  
rest of the details.
