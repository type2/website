Subject: Re: [T2] Accufire Ignition

&gt; [I acknowledge the 009 is not the correct distributor
&gt; for my `78 2 liter.  Having been a member of this list
&gt; for only a month, has taught me the need for a vacuum
&gt; advance type distributor.  I will have the opportunity
&gt; to take my VW mechanic to task in February over that
&gt; issue, during tune-up and minor repairs.  Also, Bosch
&gt; formally discontinued the 009 this last summer.  Well,
&gt; just in time for me, I guess!]


The 009 is  just fine as a backup distributor. My bus came with one
and I swapped it out for a SVDA type. The 009 is under the back seat
with a prepped set of points and condensor loaded and tested as a
spare.
