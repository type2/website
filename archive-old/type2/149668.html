Subject: Re: [T2] Leaking aux air regulator?

There was enough of the elbow left so I could get it back together and keep 
the vacuum where it belongs for now. Runs great again! I guess this is a 
good excuse to put in another order with BD. Lets see, need a new elbow, 
more oil filters, Pertronix and coil, front wheel bearin............ Isn't 
it something how a $3.00 part can empty your wallet in a hurry!

&gt; Yeah, what was happening was that you were allowing unmetered air into
&gt; the throttle body.  When you'd pinch it, it'd close off that air source
&gt; and then the AFM would notice an increase of airflow through itself.
