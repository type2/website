&gt;I was worried that bending would somehow break the seal between the tube and
&gt;the casting. I looked and it appeared as if the tube was just pressed into
&gt;the casting and secured with a spot weld.
&gt;
&gt;But I could see no other solution. I bent them, and aligned the tubes and
&gt;manifold perfectly. I used new rubber connectors (from the Bus Depot,
&gt;completely original, except beautiful and new), and it worked wonderfully.
&gt;
&gt;I suspect that the tubes *may* be brazed as well as spot welded, to allow
&gt;for alignment. Maybe I am wrong, or maybe I am lucky. I don't know because I
&gt;didn't have an extra set to saw apart.

Oh you aren't lucky, try intentionally removing those tubes
some time.  I have.  Depending on year they are just pressed
(I'd guess in while the end castings were hot) or are brazed
(more to the vanagon years.)  The little spot weld for vibration
to keep things from creeping out I guess.  I tried to get a set of
bus ones apart rather unsucessfully this summer as I wanted
to put vanagon runners into bus castings for the larger diameter
tube.  Don't worry for a second about breaking them, put a good
hunk of wood in there and bend them around or whatever or
just shove on em.  But the real trick that you might have missed
if you had the runners all the way off (which isn't strictly necessary
to change the hoses) is that the two sides are bent differently to
account for the offsets of the heads relative to the distribution box.
You need to put the left one back on the left, right back on the
right or they tend to end up misaligned and then you need to
bend em all a little to get into whack, but one side really
shows the problem.  Invariably every time I casually slap an
FI set on a bus I guess wrong and already have gasket goop
on the gaskets, and usually have already torqued em down, and
I know better.  Beyond which if you just grab a set of runners
out of the pile which you get to have after a few parts buses,
all bets are off as to how they are going to fit on the engine you
are putting em on.  Anyway, bending the runner tube is fine,
having the rubber hose under any more than a slight misalignment
is not at all good.
