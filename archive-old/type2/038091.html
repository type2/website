Subject: Re: Small Electrical Connectors?

Mike,

Another good source for this kind of stuff (especially
if you only want a couple of them), is from an auto
stereo store. I've been in a few installation bays
that had *every* kind of connector you could imagine,
and they will usually give you a few for free (I
always offer to pay, but I guess they don't want to
mess with charging you a measely buck;-)

&gt; &gt; You all tired of hearing from me yet?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Anybody know where I can find some really small
&gt; female electrical
&gt; &gt; connectors?  The ones that attach my wiring
&gt; harness to the rear side marker
&gt; &gt; lights on my 73 Westy have rotted off (on the side
&gt; where the battery is - go
&gt; &gt; figure!).  Now, I know I can fabricate something
&gt; by cutting some regular
&gt; &gt; sized ones in half and such, but surely that
&gt; particular size is available?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks!
