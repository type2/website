Thanks for your help. I have triple-checked the wires. I got my other bus
back from a &quot;volks&quot; mechanic once with two wires reversed, so I don't take
that one for granted.

In the end, I did not adjust the timing. That was to be the next project.
The dist seems good and tight. I am reluctant to start messing with it now,
as I cannot see how it could suddenly change and be causing this problem,
and I have not yet sorted out the maze of PO marks on my pulley.

Thanks for your time. If you have any other thoughts I would appreciate it.

Cheers,
Matthew

&gt; Thought of something else. Did you ever end up adjusting your timing?
&gt; If you did you might not have tightened the distributor clamp well
&gt; enough and it could have worked loose retarding your timing. alex

&gt; &gt; Could you have mixed up two plug wires? Something to look at since you
&gt; &gt; changed the spark plugs and had the connectors off.  What about the
&gt; &gt; rotor and cap, Are the clean and securely installed?
&gt; &gt; Hope you find the problem.  alex w.
