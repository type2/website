Subject: Reground Cam Summary

I'm hoping this helps out other people.  I often wonder the outcome of
many of the discussions and questions presented to the list.  I assume
many responses are p-mail, because often times I see no responses to
some questions.  So I have decided to begin posting brief summaries of
the responses I get to technical question I ask.  Plus I figure it is
easier to look up in the archives if there is a brief summary of a topic
as opposed to reading through many responses.

Back to the Topic. Summary of my responses.

Reground cams are &quot;reworked&quot; worn cams.  The original cam has been worn
beyond it's tolerance.  However, the functionality of this cam is not
necessarily lost.

Cam's function is the result of the change in height (radius) of the cam
lobes as the follower travels around it.  A reground cam has all
surfaces ground, say removing .010&quot; (just a guess).  The change in
height is returned to the factory specs.  The .010 loss is taken up by
adjustments in the rocker arms (valve adjustments).

This is a cheaper alternative because you only pay for the re-machining
of the used cam, and hopefully re-hardening.  Both of these processes
you will also pay for with a new cam.  But a new cam you also pay for
the casting, and original material costs.

Cost comparison.  about $90 new, and $49 re-ground

I got opinions both ways as to the &quot;value&quot; of a reground cam.  My hunch
is that a reground cam is probably as good as it's original counterpart
for those in a financial pinch.  However, a cam can only be reground so
many times.  But my hunch is based on no comparison between the two, as
I have only rebuilt my own engines and have no garage experience and
have only used new cam's
