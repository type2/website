Subject: clutch cable replacement?

Hi! The clutch cable snapped on the 78 westy we have come to enjoy.  I have a
new cable but was wondering if someone could clue me in to the procedure /
pitfalls/ other items that are needed to be replaced while I am there? I would
like to do this right the first time....

thanks in advance!
