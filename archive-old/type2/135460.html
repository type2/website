Subject: Tires,  Bottom Line

Bridgestone 268917 603V  185R14  TLBL  PS D.
 Is an excellent tire for my 1971 Westfalia Camper. Even the steering  is 
smoother at sharp turns. The ride is smooth and stable. I bought mine at  
Firestone tire and service center. I can go to any Firestone service center in  
America and they will honor my guarantee, and free tire rotation. They may have  to 
order them for you.
Well, worth the money.
