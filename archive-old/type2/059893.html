Subject: mystery o-ring

Greetings,
Just did an oil change on my Bus, and part (most of I think) an o-ring came
out with the screen. It is black and my guess is that it would be about 1
1/4&quot; OD if it was complete. Any experienced guesses? Push rod tube seal,
maybe? I do have a little oil on two of the PR tubes and I have been using
some oil, but it's not leaving a trail when it's parked. Any help/advice is
greatly appreciated.
Thanks in advance,
Ray Carter (it's not a car, it's a Bus)
