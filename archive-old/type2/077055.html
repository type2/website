Subject: Re: [T2] loose valve seat





&gt; &gt; To the list,
&gt;  &gt;I have since pulled my heads (that were rebuilt 4000 miles ago)on my '73 Bus
&gt; &gt; (1.7l) and discovered that the intake valve on #1 cylinder dropped its seat,
&gt; &gt; jammed the valve open and gouged the top of my piston.
&gt; &gt;         Questions:
&gt; &gt;                 1. Why the intake and not the exhaust seat? Is this common?
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; Don't know the answer to this one. I agree with your thinking but when a vw wants to drop a
&gt; valve seat it will drop any seat it chooses. My question would be why did it drop a seat on
&gt; number 1 instead of number three. Cylinder 3 is typically the hottest because of its
&gt; relation to the cooling fan, oil cooler etc...
&gt;
&gt; &gt;             2. The seat really trashed the pocket it sits in. Is this fixable/worth
&gt; &gt; fixing?
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; Sound like it might be better to get another head unless you have faith in aluminum welding
&gt; and know a shop willing to fix it.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;                 3. My piston has a gouge were the valve hit it. Should I be concerened
&gt; &gt; about the
&gt; &gt;                connecting rod and/or the crank? Can I check without
&gt; &gt; splitting the case?
&gt;
&gt; Been there, done that! Twice! Don't even think about reusing the piston. Odds are it's out
&gt; of shape in more ways than just the gouge. Depending on the miles on your engine, I would
&gt; consider purchasing new pistons and cylinders. I know it seems like a lot of money, but
&gt; consider that the P&amp;Cs' are the lungs of your engine. If you must remove the heads you might
&gt; as well replace the pistons and cylinders. Once the heads are off you don't even have to
&gt; remove any more nuts or bolts to get the P&amp;Cs off. The condition of the rods and crank can
&gt; be checked without splitting the case. But you must remove the P&amp;Cs to inspect the crank and
&gt; rods. In reality you will not be able to tell if the crank is bent but if the crank can be
&gt; rotated smoothly with no binding, things are likely OK. After removing the P&amp;Cs you can
&gt; remove the rods and inspect the journals and bearings. Probably best to replace the rod
&gt; bearings even if they look ok. You don't get this deep in the engine very often and for a
&gt; few bucks you might as well extend the life of your engine while your at it.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;                 4. If the head is trash, what are my options? Can I replace the one head
&gt; &gt; or do I
&gt; &gt;                need to do it in pairs? Are their different kinds of 1.7
&gt; &gt; heads?
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; Not real sure about the 1.7 heads. The trick is to find the part number on the head. It is
&gt; on the rocker arm side of the head. May be covered in gunk if the inside of you engine is
&gt; dirty. Find a good used head with the same part number as your dead head. (Oops, No pun
&gt; intended) Some heads have a letter at the end of the part number. Pay attention to that! The
&gt; letters refer to different revisions in the design of the head. If you can't find a head in
&gt; useable or rebuildable condition With the same part number you should buy a set of heads.
&gt; The performance and reliability of you engine depends on all 4 cylinders having the same
&gt; compression ratio. Unmatched heads mean a short engine life. Check out a Bently or any other
&gt; motor manual. Most of them describe in detail what you need to do to perform this repair
&gt; without splitting the case.
&gt; I hope my advice doesn't depress you but when a anything hits a piston you must be extremely
&gt; careful to repair all the damage correctly or your efforts will not produce lasting results.
&gt; Done right your engine should last thousands of happy miles!
&gt; Smiles, Happy holidays, and good luck!
&gt; Tom,
&gt; 75 Turtlebus. Almost ready to fire it up if I can just get a few friends to help me get the
&gt; engine off the stand and into the bus! Wish me luck. I've been working on this rebuild for
&gt; about a year. That why we call her the Turtlebus.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks for any input,
&gt; &gt;
