Subject: leaking seal
Message-Id: &lt;v03110718b366aca46ae1_at_[24.92.77.25]&gt;

     Hello!
   I have an 82 vanagon and the oil seal is leaking gear lube where the shaft
comes out of the transmission and hooks to the rear axel. The oil runs down
the side of the trans. case. Is this a difficult fix? How mutch do I have to
take apart to get at the seals to replace. Only the left side is leaking but
would like to change both.
                       Thank you for any help you can offer.
