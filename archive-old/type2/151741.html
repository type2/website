Subject: Re: [T2] Intake manifold for Holley 2 barrel/1600

Denny,

Dual port or single port?....the correct intake manifold with no plenum? 
or the *wrong* one with a big plenum?

Gonna use this on a bus????  yer gonna need to check clearance on the top 
and probably get a low profile air cleaner assly.

And for those of you who are *not* an &quot;oldtimer&quot;...LOL!, they look like 
this.

wrong one looks like this  
http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/classifieds/detail.php?id=198923

Right one looks like this
http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/classifieds/detail.php?id=191732

I can't believe this guy is asking $200 for a holley 2110 and so 
everyone knows what these look like...
http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/classifieds/detail.php?id=193915

This one is *not* a bug spray
http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/classifieds/detail.php?id=183706

Hmmm...interesting...not one single dual port holley intake manifold on 
thesamba_dot_com

Denny, got the Fischer, &quot;how to Hot Rod...&quot; book?  Read more about the 
proper manifold there....and how to set up dual port intake manifolds 
properly in order to make it run well!

Cheers, dave
