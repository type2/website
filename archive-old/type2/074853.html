Subject: Bessie--Limited Edtion Matchbox Bus

Here is the other Limited Edition Matchbox bus that we had made.  It's a
replica of our hippie bus &quot;Bessie&quot;.  The pic shows both sides of the bus,
which are each different.  If you would like to purchase one (or two) of
these, the price is $15.00 each including shipping within the USA.  You can
pay by check or money order. If you want it right away, please send a money
order, I hold orders paid by check for 2 weeks from the date I deposit the
check in my account before shipping. Send payment to:
