Subject: Re: [VB] RE: Good source for Redline MT-90?

I have to add that my transmission is an infamous Todd Hill rebuilt, and
it does have issues.  It started whining last summer, but the whine pretty
much went away.  I do not think that this is lubrication-related, and the
Redline may well have allowed this transmission to continue to live!
