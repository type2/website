Subject: Re: [T2] Samba Effect  /RANT/

&gt; If any of you are convinced that the opposing insurance company is willing
&gt; and ready to replace your old bus with a duplicate or the financial means to
&gt; replace it then I will let you represent me if this ever happens again.

My insurance company always gives me the option of filing the claim against my
insurance, paying the deductible, and then letting them recover the funds from
the other party. I always take this option. I've always gotten the deductible
back because they were able to recover 100% of their funds. This way I'm
dealing with people who I pay for their services and I'm dealing with the
terms for my insurance policy. Plus, they have gaggles of lawyers on staff to
take on the other insurance company.

But I don't have my bus insured as a collector's/antique. I don't know if I
can afford it right now. Of course if it's in an accident and it gets totaled,
what the insurance company gets might not exactly be what I was driving! My
VDO guages, stereo, and likely the entire engine, will be waiting for a new
home. That's where all of my money is anyway.

-Eric
