&gt; I see a lot of people are looking for these units and related hardware.
&gt; Does this company still exist? Has anyone ( Golde or aftermarket )
&gt; considered making reproduction units? Sure seems like somebody could

AFAIK Golde (owned now by ArvinMerritor) still makes sunroofs for Volvo
(at least they did up through '01.) and various other automakers.  (Ford
Explorers used Golde roofs for a period, for example)

The modern Golde units only share a few basic concepts with the units used
in our VWs though.

If someone wants to try to work up a contact with'm, give it a go:
