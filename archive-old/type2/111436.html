Subject: Re: [T2] my new bus 

Dan,

great news on your purchase. $300 for a rust free body alone is a good deal,
whether it's running or not.

of course just do all the normal tune-up stuff, but one of the most 
important things is:

CHECK YOUR FUEL LINES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! REPLACE IF NEEDED!!!!!!!!!!

other tips:
-get a Bentley manual (official shop manual)
-check the brakes (including the flexi-hoses, which tend to swell/constrict with age)
-test other safely-related features like running lights, turn signals, etc.

good luck &amp; welcome to the type2 community.
