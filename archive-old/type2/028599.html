Traditionally, listfolk have scoffed at this, thinking our EFI is far too simple to be effected by the Y2K issue. However, being a Y2K expert and having recently come to understand our EFI a little better, I decided to learn for myself. So, I hooked the bus up to my Y2Kometer (patent pending).

The verdict is dismaying to say the least. According to the psychogenetron levels detected in the auxiliary circult, it's very likely that those people with the altitude compensator will have serious problems. You see, altitude, for purposes of air/fuel mixture adjustment is directly related to the position of the bus in relation to the sun (which introduces a gravitational effect for which the altitude compensator must compensate--this, along with it's aptitude for altidude)...so time must be tracked, if only for the purpose of determining day/night/eclipse-time--you know; the usual stuff. It appears that the altitude compesator buses will go polar as of y2k+1, at which time they will release enough ozone to rip a hole right in the earth's protective UV layer, sucking the planet through the resulting vortex, into a black hole, which will then serve as a catalyst, elevating emissions throughout the galaxy until all life, everywhere, except God, of course, is doomed.

Of course, I could be wrong. ;-) Joe
