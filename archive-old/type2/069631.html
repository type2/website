Subject: Re: ?: Steering Wheel Alignment

Hi Steve

This is easy to fix.  You point the bus straight ahead (reckoning
by the front wheels, not the steering wheel), and twist the tie
rods until the steering wheel straightens out.  The front wheels
will not move when you do this, just the steering wheel will.
You twist the two equally in opposite directions, and see which
way the wheel goes, and adjust accordingly.

I have a page in a Bentley manual (70's Type I) that shows the
procedure, but it's in another state right now - I could scan it next
week and mail you a GIF or JPG.

        Enjoy

&gt; After new ball joints and alignment job my steering wheel is slightly
&gt; off.  In other words, when the bus goes straight the wheel is turned
&gt; about 10 degrees left.
&gt; 
&gt; It it easy enough fix this or should I just let it go?
&gt; 
&gt; The tires are wearing evenly, which is what I really care about but
&gt; still, it would be nice to correct this problem.
