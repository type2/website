Subject: '87 GL For Sale/Trade for Bus camper (in WV)

Well I'm trying again as circumstances and my fear of auto
trannies (plus I want a Lock-Right in it) kept me from the last
trade.

Want to trade for a nice clean rustfree Bus camper body '72-'79
with blown engine or tranny of equal value.  MUST be manual tranny,
prefer full Westy '76-'78 but will consider hightop Adventurer or
Safare, only condition of body important, engine or tranny can be
blown or not even present.  Interior must be in good shape.

What I got, '87 Vanagon GL, loaded, Wolfram Gray, auto, A/C,
pwin, pdl, heated pmirr, everything works OK.

Nice enough 7 passenger gray velour interior, no rips or tears,
could use a good cleaning. Rear seat folds into weekender bed,
height adjustable front armrests.

105k miles currently, new head gaskets, water pump, all FI hose,
motor mounts, some exhaust parts, a few coolant hoses, rotors,
pads, drums, shoes when I bought it at 85k.

Runs and drives strong enough. no leaks, no drips, orange coolant
stays right where it should.  Needs tailpipe, and will need muffler
within a year.

Body with dents and dings all over, pretty good crease to left rear
corner and left rear bumper. Trivial (much less than WV average) seam
rust where body is dented and on seam below drivers door, but OK
for an '87. Body condition is worst part of this Vanagon. A good beater
to drive or a great parts van to keep something else running.

Kelley online says $2500 in fair condition, which is about where this
thing is, asking $1900 with newish 27x8.5R14 Firestones or a bit less
without on crap to roll you home.  Brand new WV safety inspection,
ready to drive anywhere, worth the asking for the engine and the
auto tranny alone.  Located in Morgantown, WV, about 1.5 hours
from Pittsburg, 3 from DC or Baltimore.  Will sell outright, but prefer
the Bus camper trade.

Many DC area people have seen this thing, Steve Dolan can attest
to having driven it on at least a few occasions, if U want heat, an
auto tranny, and all those little power goodies (the heated mirrors
are real nice) and got a camper that just blew up, give me a holler.
