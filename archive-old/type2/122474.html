Subject: NGK Plugs Plug

I pulled these NGK plugs from another vehicle. The gas mileage was terrible
and a check of the maintenance records revealed they had been run for 45k
miles. The gap was way off and the center electrode whittle away but I
expected to see a lot worse.

They seem soundly constructed compared to some other plugs I've seen after
much less mileage. I'm going to put in a set of B6ES next tune up.
