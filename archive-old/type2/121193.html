Subject: Re: [T2] plastic hose clamps

I'll go ahead and pull them all off and clean the seating area.  Any 
problems with putting some weather-strip compound in there.  I figure I 
won't be taking these of again for a very long time and I want a super 
seal.  And if I do need to take them off, weather-strip cement isn't 
that difficult to break free.

Thanks,
Mike

&gt; I would stay with the factory setup. You won't find another clamp that will
&gt; do a better job. There are rubber seals on the non-return valve that may
&gt; need replacing. I believe they are available from the dealer. I would not
&gt; use any rubber hose anywhere in the booster circuit unless it is the steel
&gt; reinforced type designed for vacuum applications. The plastic hose is
&gt; usually fine, it is very strong and doesn't deteriorate.
