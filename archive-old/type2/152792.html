Subject: Re: [T2] Replacement Center Heater Tube

Hello???? whatever your name is   Go to a muffler shop or FLAPS and get a 
truck exhust pipe  cut it about 3 inches longer and slide it into the place 
either weld or rivit it  wrap it with  foam to keep the heat in   some use pvc pipe 
but I have found that tends to have a smell when it gets hot . If you want it 
to last paint the exhust pipe with por 15   later and have fun  Mark Dearing
