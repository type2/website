Subject: [T2] Brand New Front Doors

This is an item that I'm not going to import unless someone says they want
them, just because of size and cost.  But my supplier tells me that he's
sold a ton of them in Europe since he found them, so maybe I'm
underestimating demand.  You tell me. I do have to admit that they are a
rarity; I have not seen these new in years.

These are brand new, genuine Volkswagen, complete front doors for a '69-79
bus. Coming from Europe but actually made in Volkswagen's Brazilian factory.
Not just a door skin, but the complete door.  But only door; no glass, door
handle, window crank mechanism, etc.  Price would be $499.95 a pair plus
about $20-$30 shipping.  (Sold in pairs only).

If you want a set, let me know very soon, as my container is being loaded
now and will leave for port shortly.  Delivery would be about 6-8 weeks.  I
will require a $35 non-refundable deposit in order to import them for you,
just because they take up a lot of space that I could otherwise use for
something else, so I don't want to bring them in only to have the buyer
cancel.

Thanks,
