&gt;Actually, the filter is full of a fine bronze or copper steel wool that
&gt;doesn't rust, but it does cake and get blocked up with carbon- I cut one
&gt;apart that was rusted through.  I suspect you could buy a spool of very
&gt;fine wire (armature wire?) and ball it up and stuff a can and make one!

Go to any grocer or hardware store and get copper scouring pads. Exactly 
the type of stuff for this restoration. Bronse wool in a heavy grade would 
also do the job. Find this at marinas where they use a lot of it for 
maintenance on ships and boats.
