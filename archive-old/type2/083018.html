Subject: Regarding Subaru engines in buses

--0-1533882340-1017738748=:95180


Mark, could you please get back in contact with me regarding the info on Subaru engines adapted for VW Buses &amp; other vehicles.

I believe there was also a Subaru mailing list.

By the way, check out what my brother is doing with a ea-25(I think that's the model number) in a Beetle-based late 60's J&amp;S Beach Buggy at http://geocities_dot_com/peterwood73.

Cheers
