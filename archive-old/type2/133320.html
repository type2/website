&gt; When I start my 2.L FI westy it usually starts up in a couple seconds.

the FI is designed to start up without touching the accellerator

&gt; But there are times when it is slower; I usually give it a bit of gas.

sometimes I find just giving the pedal a slight depression (not pumping)
will make it start easier on colder mornings,   probably a cold start
valve prob.

&gt; Is this a bad idea? Then how long is it good to let it warm up? Is it

probably doesn't hurt

&gt; bad if you let it warm up too long? Just curious.

in theory according to VW you don't need to warm up the engine at all, me
I find the auto tranny works a little better if I let it idle for a minute
or so.
