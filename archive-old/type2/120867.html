Subject: Re: [T2] Question about horn and windshield washer system

Hiya Meg,

The VW Bus horn system has this impossible to reach connection at the bottom of the steering column.  It's accesible from underneath the bus IF one loosens the steering column, etc.  It's a PITA.  But that would be my guess as to the nature of your problem.
As for the widshield washer system................I would advise you to simply take a stroll through your local VW boneyard and find one in place.  Take notes and pictures, buy the system (It'll be pretty cheap) and go home and replace.
