George:
This might be a good time to mention flushing the entire system. Bentley or owner's manual mentions flushing every 2 (?) years!

&gt; &gt; Hello,
&gt; &gt;    I took the bleeders all the way out amd still nothing. The wheels  spin free with no pressure in the brake pedal.The brakes hold with
&gt; pressure on them. I believe it;s in thee caliper that's it;s blocked. Can I clear out that channel
&gt; &gt; Patrick
&gt;
&gt; Sounds like the entire system needs a serious cleaning, if the bleeding passages are so clogged that they will hold system pressure!
&gt;
&gt; Just as a test you might try probing the passage with a paper clip or similar wire.  See if you can poke it through.  Even if you can I would
&gt; recommend disassembly and cleaning of the entire system.
