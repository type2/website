Subject: Oil Screen???where is it??

Volks,

I have a 1.8L type 4 engine that I have a questions about. In the manuals 
that I have looked at when they talk about doing an oil change they talk 
about removing the oil screen. When I look at the bottom of my engine and 
compare it to the book(Bently\Haynes) I don't have the round part with the 
bolt where the screen should be. Is this screen only present in this place 
in the type 1 engine? I have 2 copper pipes coming from this area heading 
towards the back of the engine. Any ideas?? External oil cooler???

cheers....
