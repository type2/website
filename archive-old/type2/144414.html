&gt; Friday rant

&gt; This morning we bought a 90mpg scooter for the wife.
&gt; 49cc, water-cooled, 4-stroke. Engine is packed with high-tech. Top
&gt; speed 38mph. Quite fun to drive !

The aircooled 72cc Honda CL70 motorcycle I had in 1971 had similar mileage
and an engine packed with low tech (carb and points)  It topped out at
52MPH.

Wish I still had it.  It would be a nice grocery-getter for bus events.
