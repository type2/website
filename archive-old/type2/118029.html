Subject: Fwd: Oktoberbus the T Shirt

Hey y'all

Approved the artwork for Oktoberbus the T-shirt and it's a winner
IMHO.  We're having 50 printed up because that's about how many we THINK
we'll be able to sell on site.  We're trying the no-preorder gig this
year.  If we sell all of them and you still want one, fret not, my
printer's really good about doing another run if needed.  We'll have an
order form available, the only difference is that you'd have to pay for
postage.

If you will be there and want one, let me know by the end of the week what
sizes you want.

No, we're NOT posting the artwork, it being a secret, but if you remember
BusKnight from a few years ago the quality is at least as good.

Seeya there soon!

Mad Uncle Dave
