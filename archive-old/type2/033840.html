Subject: Re: PLFVW/todd hill/???

One of the saddest things in all of this is that it's a symptom of a larger
disease: the ever-shrinking vendor population. Until PLFVW came about,
there was virtually *no* source for pickup canvases anymore; there were
other parts that Dawn was willing to put together that had long
disappeared. I figured on someday getting my Riviera top replaced by Dawn,
who is apparently a real quality seamstress.

Todd Hill had a pretty good reputation for being a reasonably-priced tranny
builder who wouldn't screw you if you didn't need a total
rebuild...granted, there are now many people who don't feel that way. I
always figured I'd hunt up a good tranny and send it to Todd before parts
got too scarce to get them fixed anymore. Somehow, he always seemed to have
what was needed.

These are crafts people--apparently focused on quality and able to produce
quality in a Wal-Mart shopper world. The New World Order/paridigm shift to
automation/technology-driven production and such requires that these people
be driven out of business by market forces (read Tofflers &quot;Creating a New
Civilization&quot; for supporting *philosophy*). The person who is able to
juggle the craft and the business side of things can survive, but that
person is rare. (Note that successful list vendors to date tend to resell
goods that are either not available or at better prices; they are not
producers, as such.)

Dawn and Todd are not likely to appear on the list(s) again. I know *I'd*
be too embarassed to. Having been a small business owner, I know the pain
they're feeling. It's not an excuse for doing people wrong, but Steve
Lashley is right that they're probably worse off than the people left with
less money and no parts. Again, no excuse.

My guess is that these folks suffer from limited small business success
without a real long-term plan to get them through the rough times. Too bad
there's not a way for these folks to hook up with a good business person to
pull themselves out of their small business crisis. I imagine the people
left holding the bag right now would be happy to work with the vendors in
the hopes of someday getting *something* back instead of being left with
nothing...sort of like how credit card companies will work with debtors who
call and say &quot;hey, I'm short right now, but I want to pay you off instead
of defaulting.&quot; Problem is, these vendors have to continue to do what's
necessary to feed their families, even at great peril to their reputation,
or even their karma/spirit/soul--it's a parent sort of thing; one of those
really tough choices that's quite the no-brainer.

I was hesitant to even post this, since it is sooooo close to off-topic. My
only willingness to do so is that I hope some thinking person might have a
way to offer up a dignified solution that could help one or the other of
these vendors get back on their feet. I don't believe the hobby can afford
to loose either if personal tragedy is the cause; if intentional deception
is the factor, then good riddance!

There's no point in ranting on to the list about how you've been screwed
and think they ought to be hung by their toes. If you feel the need to vent
based on this note, please p-mail me and I promise to read your reply
twice; three times if you insist. I've been in your shoes too and it sucks!
Just hate to see good volks go down so hard on either side.

Oh well, back to the real world. Good luck to all! Vendors and Vendees!

Thanks! Joe
