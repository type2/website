Subject: [T2] Wiring Help

Hello there,

I just got a 1970 bus, and found that the wring is messed up from the 
starter to the ing. switch.  In the Haynes book it has a diagram for a 1968 
and then a 1972 onward, but not the 1970. Can some one point me in the 
direction of a wiring diagram or send me one?

Mike
