I second Mike's opinion of Heckmann &amp; Thiemann--it's a great shop.  You'll
pay a little more, but you won't have any nagging questions in the back of
your head.  They've worked on my DC and on a '79 hightop camper I used to
have.  I've got my '68 DC in there right now getting fitted with a new 1600
longblock from Ronnie at OldVolks_dot_com.  You also mentioned German Auto
Salvage--I bought a manifold from them yesterday over the phone and they
dropped it off at H/T this morning.  German Auto Salvage has decent prices
and Heckmann &amp; Theimann recommend them--good enough for me.

Also, if you're out that way, there's a great mechanic in Newberg, OR: S&amp;D
Auto.  Steve Smits is the owner/mechanic and he's done good work for me on
both the DC and my old camper.  30175 NE Smits Lane in
Newberg...503-538-4151
