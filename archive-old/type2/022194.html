Subject: '82 Vanagon for sale $500

Don't know much about these beasts, but.............
Here is what I found...........

1982 Vanagon with all of the inside stuff in reasonably good shape, and
the large fiberglass turtle like top on the vehicle. 
I guess this would have been a deluxe model camper from that year;
beats me.

I stopped to look at it, as I had seen it several times; always parked
in the same spot.

My quick look over ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The engine is shot, but perhaps is in good enough shape to do a
re-build on.
The body has no rust at all, from what I could tell.
The interior stuff is all there, although seat cushions and some
miscellaneous fabric items will need replacement. All other interior
items will just need cleaning and shining.
The tires are new with only about 50 miles on them.

She sits, parked in an old filling station, in a small town just North
of Houston.

The owner wants $500 for her.
Looks to me like just a few parts, needed by the right person, would
exceed that price.

Anyone out there interested, come back to me, and I'll give you the
details on how to contact the owner.
