Subject: Business Conflict Resolution 101

Craig:

First, let me commend your calm and rational effort at resolving your
problem. You are creating a positive atmosphere conducive to
communication and resolution.

In light of the recent uproar about vendor relations, I submit the
following information:

If you have a problem with a business, you have several options open to
you under the law. You may:

1. Work with that business directly for a constructive resolution
amenable to both parties.

2. Contact your state consumer affairs/protection department for
mediation. You can usually find contact information in the government
pages of your phone book.

3. File a claim with small claims court. Since small claims court is
considered a last resort, you as plaintiff must prove to the court that
you have made a reasonable effort at constructive resolution with the
defendant before pursuing this option. If the court rules in your favor,
then you may initiate collection efforts. Collection efforts are subject
to certain guidelines to ensure fairness to all parties involved.

4. If you have strong evidence of criminal activity, then you may file a
criminal report with the appropriate police jurisdiction, and if the
district attorney determines there is a case, they will take it from there.

That's it. It's a bit of work, and if you need more detailed information
it is available for free at the local library. You will be able to get
some resolution, rather than feeling as though you're left in limbo. As
with most challenges in life, doing something about it is far more
productive than just sitting around complaining.
