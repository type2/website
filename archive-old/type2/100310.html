Subject: RE: [T2] Re Bus Depot service-my experience (++)

Ron, on Sunday, 10 Nov you said:

&quot;Basically the same as they had before, but a bit more nicely put together
now that they're making it themselves in the U.S. rather than in Mexico. &quot;



Ron, is Pacesetter making the BODY of the muffler in the USA??

A while back, when I talked with S&amp;S Headers about their one piece muffler 
for my '78, S&amp;S said that they imported the muffler body, but made and 
connected their own 'pipes'.
