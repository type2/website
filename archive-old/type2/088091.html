Subject: Re: [T2] 69 and 71, transmission changes

This man takes the prize! Thank you, very much! Jan B

 Will a 69 transmission work in a '71 bus? both use the same CV joint =
and axle, of course. I am only aware of a change to the clutch style. =

 Hey, finally one I can answer!  This is the same set-up I have in my bus.
 My 71 tranny went belly up. Took one from the 69 parts bus. All I had to do
 was change the throw-out bearing and pressure plate. It's been in for about
 5 years and going strong. As far as I can tell it must be pretty close to
 the same gear ratios.
