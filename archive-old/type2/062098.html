Sam, 

Fuel in Australia is also sold in litres. However, being old enough to 
remember fuel sales in gallons, I still need to work out fuel consumtion 
in miles per gallon. Most people my age are the same. 

If I say to someone my vehicle used X litres/100km or Xkm/litre, they don't 
know what I'm talking about. Neither do I. Therefore, we still talk mpg. 

A really economical car gets over 35mpg. An ordinary one gets around 
thirty. A poor one gets less than 25 (my Kombi) and a gas guzzler 
(generally classed as Yank tanks) get less than 20. Rolls Royces are 
also gas guzzlers.
