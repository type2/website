Subject: The reason it's called E-BAY is.......it's not TYPE2!

I'd like to weigh in on this issue again. I posted a note last week 
suggesting that a 3rd list not be formed, since type2_dot_com alreadys maintains 
a classified section. Not to be overly cynical, but it seems like 
unnecessary duplication of information.

I like the intiative taken to poll the listees.  The results indicate that 
it's not a simple yes/no question but an issue with many facets. Only let 
sellers post, only allow 2 posts per item, tag them with a header.....what 
happens if people start replying, to the list, about these items? To me, 
it's unnecessary complication to come up with a bunch of new rules 
specifically for e-bay classified ads.

And to address the issue of &quot;how come vendors and not me&quot; - here's my 
thought: Ron Salmon sells parts day in and day out, but he doesn't post his 
entire catalog on the list every day. Maybe once in a while we get postings 
about new parts. He doesn't spam the list every day with postings. But if 
everyone posting an e-bay item decides to send a note to the list, you're 
going to have a lot of clutter.

If you want classifieds, check the type2 classifieds. If you want e-bay, you 
can 1. go to  e-bay. 2. go to samba_dot_com. Though I haven't tried it, you can 
search e-bay listings over there.
I'd personally rather see the list stick to more technical/restoration 
dicsussions, and keep the classifieds out.

If some people think the vendor discussions are too consuming, then write a 
note and ask admin if they would tighten up on those threads.

Thanks
Mat
