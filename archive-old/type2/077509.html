rebuilding a 75 1800 engine...

couple questions... i bought new mahle pistons and cylinders... the =
pistons do not have arrows, but they do have a little symbol that looks =
like this (i love ascii)

____
|      |    |----|
|      |    |    |
|      |__|     |=20
|      |         |
|      |         |
--------        |

so is that indicating the flywheel pointing side of the piston?

also, i installed my oil pump by loosening the two case bolts on either =
side of the houseing, tapping it in, then retightening those bolts... =
question is that i have no idea if i seated the tab right into the =
cam... it turns smoothly, and the pump seated all the way in against the =
gasket so i'm assuming i had to have seated that tab right, right?

thanks!
