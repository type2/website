Subject: changeing oils in the crankcase?

I have a quick question for someone...
i was reading in john muirs book and he says that what he liked to use was SAE 30 castrol....
so how would a person go about cleaning whatever oil they had in the crank case out to use SAE 30 castrol.
i knew know better and there fore ran castrol 20 w 50 in there like i do my old buick.
well we live and learn but just didnt know any betyter at the time..
is there a sure way for me to change to SAE 30 castrol and it not affect the engine.
didnt know if the castrol 20 w 50 might be caked up in the oil cooler or not?
or anywhere else for that matter.???
thanks for all the help.
muir speaks of cleaning the old oil out but i did not see whare he says how to clean it out..
this is when he is talking about detergents and things i the oil ....
thanks
