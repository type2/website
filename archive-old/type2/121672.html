&gt;OK, call me stupid, but what causes a bus to catch on fire?  It seems to

&gt;temperature must something be at to ignite gasoline without a spark?  I'm
&gt;just trying to understand.

A good question. The fire triangle says heat, oxygen and fuel are necessary for combustion. The ignition temperature of gasoline is about 500F. I'd have to conclude that the exhaust tubing is hot enough to ignite the fuel and the foam, furniture and fabric are enough to help it spread from the engine compartment to engulf the bus. Tires seem to burn for a long time.

I've actually seen gasoline drip from a leaking fuel pump on my old beetle and the gas turned into a nice litle blue flame as it hit the pea shooter exhaust pipes.
