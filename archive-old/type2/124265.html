Subject: Re:Toolkit for bus pickup trip

Greg,
    The first thing to do is check with the airline and see if he'll
be able to get any kind of toolbox on the airplane.  I work as an
aircraft mechanic and years ago when the company sent me on a road
trip I almost had to leave my tools behind because the airline I was
traveling on wouldn't let me take them on the plane, not even as
checked baggage.  I appealed to the Captain of the flight, explained
the situation, and he let my toolbox ride in the cockpit as a
professional courtesy to me.  In this post 9/11 world I don't know
what might happen to your Dad's tools or parts
