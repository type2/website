Subject: RE: [T2] winter handling / driving

&gt; As for salt . . . have done a lot of west coast winter driving and the
&gt; majority of the roads I encountered have been plowed and then had sand
&gt; or gravel thrown down.  I'm not saying that it's not done out west, I'm
&gt; sure it's done somewhere, I just haven't seen it.

Must be why we have so many nice Buses out here in Washington!

BUT....

http://www.wsdot.wa_dot_gov/maintenance/salt.htm

In the state of Washington, they've started using salt again as of winter
2002-2003, for the first time since the 1980s.  The main reason is cost.
I-695, a voter initiative, changed vehicle licensing fees from a 
percentage of value to a flat $30/year.  Of course, this slashed the 
licensing fee for new-car drivers to pennies on the dollar, but actually 
raised the price for old vehicles, including all aircooled VWs.  The state
transportation budget has been a mess ever since, so now we get salt.
