Subject: Stranded in Southern Utah. Need a helping diagnosis.

Hi everyone,
I am currently on a road trip from Seattle to Southern Utah. I arrived in St.
George, UT this morning to come to a realization that I cannot change gears
(manual) from 2nd to 3rd. The only gears I can use now are 2 and 4. I had to
have the '80 Vanagon towed to a Texaco station because no other mechanics were
open. So I am stranded here for the weekend at the least.
The mechanic crawled under and came to the conclusion that the problem is
transmission. Does anybody have any other suggestions that I could bring up to
another mechanic on monday? Thanks in advance. It would be much appreciated
for any advice.

TheWaitingGamesContinuesAgain,

Ryan O.
'80 Vanagon   F.I./Sierra
