Subject: Re: [T2] RE: voltage regulator toasted UPDATE

As much as I appreciate a good smack-down, I'd appreciate your
knowledgable response more. For example, there are 3 wires going from
the VR to the ALT. Since the termination point of the 3 wires at the
ALT is covered by a plate on the front (FIF), how do I check the wiring
without removing the ALT to expose the wiring? The only remaining wire
is the blue one running to the front. No, I didn't test it yet. I plan
to test all of them, but I need them exposed to test them.

I read the Bentley section on testing the ALT in-vehicle, and I don't
own, nor do I have access to, all 3 of the different metering
components that need to be in-series to collect the readings as
described. I have a single multi-meter. From the description in the
Bentley, that is insufficient to qualify the charging system. So, if I
can't test it, I can either drive the bus to somone who can, or pull
the ALT out and have it tested. I thought knowingly driving the bus
when it was in a &quot;known broken&quot; state was bad juju and I'd bust a few
knuckles instead. You suggested that I just open the phone book to find
someone to test the ALT. There aren't 100 in Portland; the one Bosch
parts place that I found is ACVW supportive but they don't test. Even
if there were a bunch of them, someone from PDX on this list has
experience with one of them, and I asked for their referral. Not from
Portland? Skip that part. I know there are a few other Puddletown cats
out here.

I asked if I fried another VR although the engine wasn't started, but
the electricals were completed. I'd like to know if I need to buy
another one when I'm out getting the ALT tested.

You mentioned as a part of the great Wells -v- Bosch debate that
sometimes seemingly unrelated breakdowns cause failures. I took that to
mean that there can be a short in one subsystem that manifests itself
in a completely unrelated system. It was insight into that statement
that I was seeking. I guess you thought I asked for a wrist slapping.
Now that you've gotten that out of your system, either add value or
don't respond.
