Subject: Re: [T2] 73 bus valve problems

Jenny,

Awwww....my bet is that part of your carb has fallen down into
the intake and stuck in the valve.

Check carb for missing parts, usually the fuel pump injection 
tube...little u shaped tube at the top(or at least it's supposed to be!

The good news...

If it is that part, then it probably hasn't hurt anything and you can pull 
the head off, take it out and put the head back on and go on.

Cheers, dave

 adjusted valves approximately 2 weeks ago.
 
 
 It ran great for the 10 minutes I tested it.
 
 last night I went for a drive, and there was
 extreme loss of power, backfiring.
 
some snipped&gt; 
&gt; I opened up the left hand valve cover,
&gt; turned engine to #3 firing position, and
&gt; checked the valves.  Exhaust... fine.
&gt; Intake:  about 1/4&quot; clearance between
&gt; rocker and valve stem....
&gt; 
&gt; The lock-nut was tight.  I am positive
&gt; I got it tight when I adjusted it the other
&gt; day.
&gt; 
&gt; what could cause this sudden increase
&gt; of clearance between rocker and valve
&gt; stem?
&gt; 

*******&gt; something dropped into intake

&gt; 
&gt; The bus was running fine before I
&gt; took out the carb and cleaned it.  The
&gt; problems I am having now are not carb
&gt; problems though...  The valve has become
&gt; way out of adjustment.
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas?
&gt; 
&gt; Jen
