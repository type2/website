Subject: $100 and it's yours -   re: [T2] OK, It's  - Save the
  Transporter in California - time

I want to get this thing to a good home, it needs motor work but the
chassis is in real good shape.

Save it from the Evil Roommate. He wants to tow it to the junkyard.

It's going on Craig's List Monday evening, VWVortex Aircooled, etc.

T2 List gets 1st dibs.
