Subject: re: timing

&gt;&gt;I have an 009 in my 74 single cab
with type IV and dual weber ICT's.  Is the
desired 25 degrees of 
advance supposed to be set from the reference
point of the factory 7.5 ATDC idle timing OR from
TDC?  

First off, I'm assuming your 74 has a type IV
engine.  In that case, 25 degrees of advance (WOT
at 25 degrees BTDC) is insufficient.  That is  a
number used for type I engine.  I'm trying to do
this without Bentley, but the total advance, both
centrifugal and vacuum, is around 40-44 on a
stock type IV setup.  The numbers vary a little
from year to year but the static timing on these
is all about the same, too, around 7.5 btdc (in
other words if you remove the retard from the
equation on the factory dual vacuum dual advance
dizzies.)  

Your 009 just cannot provide enough advance for a
type IV--that's why most who recommend a
mechanical dizzy for a type IV say to use 050. 
050 is also a little faster advance.  You'll get
close to the right amount by purchasing a rebuilt
single or dual vacuum dual advance dizzy, even if
it's a late bug dizzy.  Or try the SVDA from
aircooled_dot_net although for the life of me I
cannot see a difference between it and a late
loaf factory dizzy. 

But for now you have this 009.  I would set it at
7.5 btdc at idle (I think 800-850 rpm).  Why? 
Because the factory thought that was a safe
timing at idle in the single vacuum dual advance
distributors on later busses.  Strobe it to see
how much advance you get at WOT.  If it's no
where near 40-44 I'd bump it to the left some,
maybe 10 degrees BTDC or even more, but be
careful.  Too much advance and you'll get
detonation and grenade your engine in a hurry. 
I'd run it short of the proper total advance (and
put up with no power at high rpm) before I'd run
too much advance at idle.  

I don't no anything about dual ICT's so I cannot
help much there.  Didn't you buy it off
aircooled_dot_net?  Maybe they could give
suggestions.
