&gt; I almost purchased a thermostat from a
&gt; local vendor--until I realized it was partially (and
&gt; unevenly around its diameter) opened.  This was a new German
thermostat
&gt; (box said made in Germany, but the brand name was not familiar).  It
&gt; appeared there was too much gas in the bellows

The thermostats work with a liquid (probably an alcohol) that is a
liquid below the thermostat's set temperature and a gas above that
temperature.  When the temperature drops below the set temperature,
the alcohol attempts to liquify.  This lowers the pressure inside the
thermostat, which causes the atmospheric pressure outside to push the
can to the collapsed position.  Thus, the thermostat uses atmospheric
pressure to push it to the closed position.

The partially collapsed thermostat wasn't caused by having too much
alcohol.  The amount of alcohol is not terribly important to the
operation of the thermostat, as long as some is present and (important
part here!) no other substances are inside the thermostat.

My theory is that this thermostat has a tiny leak and that air has
found its way into the thermostat through that leak.  It's unlikely
that the alcohol would come out, since there is a partial vacuum
inside the canister when it is cold (the canister is new, and never
warmed up).

The air in the canister would never liquify, so the canister would
never get any smaller than the air volume inside.  The alcohol in the
canister would expand the canister to its correct length if it were
heated.

Good call on passing on this thermostat.  I'd hate to try to fix one. 
You'd need a vacuum pump and the correct alcohol, along with some way
of opening and sealing the canister.
