&gt;Also, i have a set of dansk heater boxes. they were brand new from the old
&gt;le-coz offer... i only put 3k miles on em and now they have minor surface
&gt;rust in places but are otherwise as new.  $275/obo
&gt;
&gt;pair of like new dansk heater control boxes for an 80 vanagon(replaced
&gt;by le-coz, 3k miles on em) ... cant find a price for these new... $100 for
&gt;the pair??? (or if theyre cheaper than i think new, let me know)

Sorry for the flame, but I gotta speak my mind:  Glad to see profiteering is
alive and well on the type2 list.  Bad karma goes along with getting parts
for free and reselling them for substantial profit.  I think I would have
been embarrassed to advertise this on the list, but hey, its your parts,
your business, and your karma.

BTW, bus depot sells Dansk control boxes for $49.95 ea (72-79 bus) and
heater boxes for 149.95 (German 72-74 right side only) or 189.95 (Dansk
75-78 buses) or 349.95/pr (NOS German) for 80-83 Vanagon.
