X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

I thought I would pass on some info I have learned about the type 4 heads.
There seems to be a lot of heads out there that have cracks, most of these
are the 2.0L heads. It seems that the FI runs somewhat lean and this with
neglected cooling systems burn up the heads. Out of the heads that I have
found, all the 2.0L heads were shot, some 1.8L heads shot, some good. But
almost all the 1.7L heads were good. I just bought a 1.7L yesterday for $25
and both heads were perfect, no cracks and no dropped seats. I mentioned
that I had come across a good set of 1.8L Carbed heads and I got an inbox
full of offers to buy them(there not for sale). Of the heads out there, the
1.8 Carbed had the biggest valves, the 1.7L were next and then the 2.0L.
Most people walk away from 1.7L heads because they will not bolt right on a
1.8/2.0L. They must be fly cut. See the Wilson Book for more info on valve
sizes. 
So heres the deal, if you need some good heads for you Bus 1.8L carbed will
give the biggest valves and command the highest price. 2.0L heads are high
also due to the lack of heads that are still good, most need welding. 1.7L
heads are often over looked and are cheap. The money you save will more than
pay to have them opened up. You should have any heads cleaned up anyway. The
heads I got have no EGR ports, some do, some don't. Some 1.7Ls have the CHT
sensor hole, others don't. You may have to drill and tap a hole. If you have
a Vanagon(or 79 Bus) and have the square ports, you are stuck with locating
those.
Deals are out there to be had. I now have 1 2.0l Vanagon engine, 1 1.8l
Carbed, and 2 1.7L engines, I got all for less than $100.
I hope this will help someone in need of heads.
