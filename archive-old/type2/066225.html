Subject: Fluke Digital Multi-Meters for Autos (long)

Hi All,

I thought some of you might be interested in the following =
information. I'm a firm believer in Fluke products, and so I didn't =
check out other DMM manufacturers sites. Standard disclaimer: I don't =
work for Fluke.

If you're interested in pulling this info down for yourself, you can =
surf on over to: 

http://www.fluke_dot_com/autotools/products.htm

I=B9ve basically just copied text down from their pages, and =
rearranged it. I didn't get prices.

In a nutshell Fluke makes 9 DMM's geared for automotive use. In =
addition they also offer probes that you can attach to your DMM for =
added use, and software for connecting certain models to your PC.

************
Heres an overview of the models:
************
Fluke 8
Fluke 23
Fluke 27
Fluke 73
Fluke 77
Fluke 78
Fluke 83
Fluke 87
Fluke 88
Fluke 98 &lt;--- not really a DMM, but a full function handheld scope.

If all you test is voltage, resistance and continuity, use the Fluke =
8 -- the lowest cost, the most basic features and the simplest =
operation.

If you also measure current, but are working on a budget, use the =
Fluke 73 -- basic multimeter features, plus current measurements up =
to 10 Amps.

If you need an excellent all around multimeter, use the Fluke 23 or =
Fluke 77 -- High accuracy, extreme ruggedness and all around =
performance have made these two meters the most asked for DMMs in the =
world.

If you need the absolute most rugged multimeter you can buy the Fluke =
27 -- Designed to MIL Specs., the 27 is built like a tank. It=B9s =
totally waterproof -- it even floats.

If you need the special functions automotive repair requires, use the =
Fluke 78 -- A full-featured DMM that adds RPM, dwell and temperature. =
All for a reasonable price.

The Fluke 83 offers most of the features and accuracy of the 87 and =
88, but for less cost. For an all-around high-performance DMM, the 83 =
is an excellent choice.

If you need to capture high speed glitches, use the Fluke 87 -- It =
offers 1 millisecond glitch capture.

If you want the best all-around automotive multimeter, use the Fluke =
88 -- Specialized automotive functions like RPM, duty cycle, dwell, =
relative change, lo-ohms and smoothing. Complete with deluxe silicone =
insulated test leads, probes and clips. Packaged in a battle-tough =
carrying case.


************
The FLUKE 98 ScopeMeter
************
The scope you already know how to use. The Fluke 98 combines a =
two-channel lab scope, engine analyzer, flight recorder and digital =
multimeter into one easy-to-use handheld tool designed to mirror your =
diagnostic approach. The new Fluke 98 Automotive ScopeMeter is the =
fastest, simplest way to capture waveforms and detect intermittent =
problems.

Automated Sensor Tests The 98 utilizes a simple keypad and menu =
system that uses familiar automotive terms. You don=B9t need to be =
=8Cscope jockey to operate this one. Select the signal you wish to =
see and the 98 figures it out from there. The 98 can even track on =
changing signals, things like changes in RPM automatically!!!

Engine Analyzer Functions Not only does the 98 make measurements and =
display waveforms, it performs many automated tests. The kind of =
tests that have previously been available only on large console-type =
engine analyzers. Things like: Battery Condition, Charging, Cranking, =
Relative Compression just to name a few.

Applications Works on 1,2,3,4,5,6,8 cylinder cars, 2 or 4 stroke, =
diesel and gasoline engines, DIS, conventional and coil-on-plug =
systems, and 6, 12 or 24V electrical systems.

Warranty 3 years (ScopeMeter), 1 year (Accessories)
