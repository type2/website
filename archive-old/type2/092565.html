Subject: Re: [T2] exhaust reassembly getting me at heated up!

&gt;7  I cannot get her muffler back on for the life of me! Everything was put 
&gt;back as it came off in that respect...  I did have a time getting the 
&gt;heater box on the left side on...  Now the exhaust ports are about an half 
&gt;of an inch too close together it seems and hence that ol' muffler just 
&gt;will not go back on

Loosed all the exhaust port nuts, then install the muffler loosely, then 
tighten all fastener in turn until all are tight. If that doesn't work, you 
have non-spec somewhere. Did you check the deck heights?? If the cylinder 
bases in the case have been cut several times, you must use thicker base 
gaskets to reset the cylinders out properly. I've seen aftermarket mufflers 
and such which were in fact uninstallable due to being way out of wack with 
a real VW.
