&gt; For the last few months I've been looking for a bus and I appreciate the many

&gt; dream bus. Here's the nightmare. I want some of your opinions because I know 
&gt; I'm emotional about this. I purchased a '70 Dormobile from a guy in 

yes, first thing is take a break and calm down, have a nice Easter (or
whatever holiday you celebrate) eat a nice meal and let it sit for a week
before you do anything (ask me how I know)

&gt; Chatanooga, Tn. It was fully restored. He has two other buses, and portrays 
&gt; himself as very experienced with them. He farmed out all body and paint work, 
&gt; but rebuilt the engine himself. He said it had 12k miles on total rebuild. He 

unless you have evidence to the contrary accept this fact.

&gt; got the video and  fell in love. I made an offer of $7600,(asking $8000) he 
&gt; accepted with &quot; a few conditions&quot;. In retrospect here's where I think my red  

anyone who sells even a fully restored one other than &quot;as is&quot; is asking
for it!  And if someone sold me one other wise, I would see that as a red
flag, as you have been told by others, this is a 30+ year old vehicle

&gt;  When we met I ask him again if I was okay driving it 350 miles. He said &quot; 
&gt; I've driven it farther than that with no problems. We use it to camp often, I 
&gt; wouldn't hesitate to drive it across the country. I know the vehicle, I'm 
&gt; experienced, I did everything to spec., and you can trust this bus. He writes 

I could say the same thing about mine, and just got back from a 1600 mile
trip to new England BUT I would still sell it (it's not for sale) &quot;as is&quot;
why because something in this thing is going to break sooner or later
unless I have more time and money than I really have to replace
everything. (dr T aside).. major difference is &quot;I KNOW&quot; my bus, I know the
&quot;feel and sound&quot; of it, something starts being &quot;Strange&quot; I know to start
looking for something, and I know what I fixed and what is on the &quot;to do
list&quot; and in the back there are the &quot;key&quot; usual suspects parts and the
tools to do something about it, and the knowledge of when to turn it off
and use the AAA card in my pocket to get me out of this mess

&gt; &quot;as is&quot; on the bill of sale. I ask him about this and he says&quot; you have to 
&gt; remember this is a 30 year old vehicle, so things can happen, but if you have 

common practice

&gt; any problems within a reasonable amount of time I'll work something out with 

have you given him the chance to do this??

&gt; I pay $350 plus gas to get a U-haul and a trailer, and I bring it home to  
ouch, but &quot;been there done that&quot;

&gt; Mobile. The next day I trake it to a well-known VW shop an hour away who says 
&gt; he pretty sure its a rod, and he will let me know the extent of the damage 

Don't trust him either find someone on this list or other &quot;experienced&quot; VW
guru or owner to go with you to check it out....in the VW little things
can cause &quot;Big&quot; problems, and sometimes it is a simple and easy to fix.
(like maybe a broken push rod, or loose rocker assembly)

&gt; diagnosis! Here's how I feel. I paid serious money  so I could avoid this 
&gt; kind of crap! I feel that 80 miles before a problem such as this is 

yes it is serious money and not having this problem is what you paid for,
BUT if you really wanted to not have the chance of this problem you should
buy a NEW Conversion Eurovan, there will ALWAYS be a chance for some
problem in a older vehicle, metal fatigue is always a possibility or who
knows what the PPPPO (previous (n) owner, maybe two or three people before
the owner you bought it from

&gt; ridiculous and he should pay every bit of the truck/trailer rental as well as 
&gt; the repair. Of course he holds all of the cards, and I'm at the mercy of his 
&gt; conscious, a scary proposition these days, as honor can be as rare as a 

don't judge until he proves he is not honorable, and remember he probably
was just as honest as he made out to be......be reasonable...if he covers
part of the engine repair I would suggest take it and write it off as a
learning experience.

&gt; therapy here! I want to know how you people feel. I also think he is on the 
&gt; list, and hopefully he will see this and want to do the right thing. Our 

you really should have tried to work this out before accusing him (and I
don't even know who you are talking about) of anything, give him the
benefit of the doubt (heck in 30+ years of owning VW's I only sued one,
and I even gave GEX more than a year to work it out before suing)

&gt; encouraging, although he hasn't told me to get lost yet! 

consider that a sign that he is reputable and try to work it out, don't
expect him to pay the tow, but half of the repair might be reasonable, or
if he is willing to &quot;Make it whole&quot; (like replacing or repairing the
engine) accept this, it is better than you would get from the local Used
car lot.

ANYONE of us that has owned one of these beasts for more than a year or
two have been down the road you are on....hang in there the rewards far
outweigh the hassles and frustrations....look at the bright side, you have
another car, think about us that have to (or chose to) use our VW's as
daily drivers and have no room or money for a second car or a parts
vehicle.

take a break and use the time to educate yourself, buy Muir and Bentley,
read em, go to a VW event, meet a few other drivers etc, or cut your loses
and resell the VW and write it off as a bad experience, but you will not
get anywhere letting it fester
