Subject: Insulation for heating pipes on a 73 VW Bus.

Hello all.  I'm sure there has been plenty of talk about this in the past, so 
I appoligize in advance for any repeat on this.

I have a 1973 VW Camper bus, and my heat works pretty great!   I'd like to 
see about insulating the heater pipes from where the leave the heater boxes all 
the way to the front of the bus to get maximum heat.    I know regular 
insulation will hold water and possibly rust out the piping.  So what can I use that 
will keep water from building up and be tolerant of high temperatures?

Any information you can offer would be much appreciated.  Thanks!
