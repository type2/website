&gt;Hello everyone.
&gt;I just installed a Pertronics Ignitor in my 72 type 4 dual vacuum
&gt;distributer. It seems to work fine except that I can't get the same timing
&gt;spread I got when it had points. Before it idled at around 4 degrees ATDC
&gt;and tops out at about 38 degrees BTDC. Now in order to get the 38 degrees
&gt;of advance needed to run normally I have to advance everything and end up
&gt;with 4 degrees BTDC at idle, an 8 degree difference from before. Is there a
&gt;reason for this?  

Yes, wizband non stock add on not properly designed (Neandereered).

&gt;What can I do to make the timing spread more normal?

Go back to stock Neandeerered design or put nore time/money into
experimentation with a further variety of non stock modifornications.

&gt;What would be the highest advance I could run without overheating or
&gt;otherwise damaging the engine?

Bentley provides the specs for the stock motor. If the full range of
advance varies from stock anywhere along it's climb through the RPM's,
expect either less power somewhere or more stress for the motor..........
or both.
