Subject: &quot;Just for the Fun of it III&quot; toy show

    Just got back from the Portsmouth NH toy show and was a bit
disappointed with the attendance... just 8 vendors and about 12
displays...

    Sold enough to make my wife glad she went if not extremely happy...

    Kept my purchases low (spent $10...), but managed a few mutually
fulfilling swaps...  Ended up with 3 Husky construction vehicles
(fair-poor condition), a early Budgie Barndoor (fair condition) and a
VGC copy of the July 1955 Popular Mechanics magazine with the Barndoor
Westy on the cover (this was what I spent cash on, I've been searching
for this one for 3-4 years...)

    Talked a bit with Frank Konisky (of People Kar Co) and discussed the
March Toy show next year... due to the poor reception from the
Litchfield Inn (the reason the Litchfield Bug-In was moved to Harwinton
Fairgrounds also) he is looking to move the venue to somewhere closer to
Springfield MA.

    This was the last major event for ME and NH clubs for the season...

    Will let you all know a calender of events for Northeast after the
first of the year...

            Take care

                    JonR

        Bright Orange '73 Westy automatic &quot;JULIUS&quot;

            White/Turquoise '63 Standard Microbus

    Both of whom stayed at home today &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;
