&gt; While most California and East Coast listees may find it hard to

Interesting.  You would think that in the UK, where you can be hung drawn
and quartered for using non-metric units (I exaggerate --- slightly) metric
sized hoses would be commonplace.  This doesn't appear to be the case.  I
have yet to find a source for any of the correct size hoses for my engine
except for the fuel line and carb-dizzy vacuum line, and these two were from
a main VW dealer.  If you want 1/4 inch, 3/8 etc, no problem.
Why?
