So hopefully the reason the car was lurching turned out to be something
pretty simple. We took a look at the engine and noticed that where the spark
plug hooked up to the distributor cap was really loose. So we tightened it
and took it for a little test drive and it was fine.

Thanks to everyone who sent such helpful responses!

timing is adjusted by just turning the distributor and is very easy to do
with a
timing light, impossible, at least for me, without one though some people do
it
&quot;by ear&quot; if the distributor is somehow rotated at all it would be off, or if
it
is the points they could just be worn, also could be as simple as a loose
ignition wire, you know Achems razor, the most obvious solution is usually
the
correct one,  i once &quot;broke down&quot; and tried to find out what was wrong
thinking
i had some big problem and getting very worked up. 45 minutes later i check
to
see if the wires are tight, sure enough one was loose i stuck it on nice and
tight and drove away smacking myself for not checking the wires first, now
its
the first thing i check :-)
BTW you may find muir is not too helpful for a later model bus like a 76,
the
book really focuses on bugs and cars with the 1600 if you have the
chance/extra
cash you may want to pick up a bus only book like haynes or bently.  A muir
book
was the first i ever bought (well actually, got it free)  i read it once,
got
introduced to vws mechanically then got a Bentley (from a used book store,
great
place to find repair manuals, people usually sell them when they sell their
cars) and haven't used the muir since.
good luck hope you get things straightened out
