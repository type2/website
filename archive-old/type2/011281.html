Hello Listers:

I'm trying to locate a right side heater tube for a '76 Campmobile.  It's 
the sheet metal tube that connects the heat exchanger to the heater control 
box on the body.  It's a &quot;lazy S&quot; shape with a bracket attached. The bracket 
is bent to a 90 degree angle at the end with two bolt holes drilled.  The 
whole thing is about 10-12&quot; long.

I've replaced the left side heat exchanger and the heater tube on that side 
is in good condition.  The right side tube is corroded away along with the 
metal jacket on the old heat exchanger.  No wonder there's precious little 
heat available in the winter!!

I picked up a used tube from a junk yard on a recent trip down to Oregon.  
It must be for an older model as the S shape is different and is unusable 
for my application.  Let me know if anyone is looking for an older set of 
tubes. (right and left)

Can anyone help?.  New tubes list for about $59 in the Bus Depot catalog.  
I'd buy new but they appear to be out of stock.  I'd be willing to pay 
$10-$25 plus shipping for good, used right side tube.

Thanks for any assitance available.
