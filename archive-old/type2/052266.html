A good example of German parts are trans mounts. I went out of my way to get
GERMAN trans mounts, they came, I stock them, I pay more for them, I have to
sell them for more money, but do they last longer, are they better, now the
TRUTH.

In comparing the GERMAN mounts to ones I also carry from INDIA, they are
EXACTLY the same. The onlt difference I could find in them were that the
GERMAN ones had GERMANY cast into the rubber and they came in a GERMAN box.
Upon closer examination you could see where a die was added to the mold to
make the GERMANY imprint. No where on the box or the parts does it say MADE
IN GERMANY, just Germany. If you look at a mount made in INDIA you can see
the area in the part were the die was added and/or removed so the name of
any country could really be added. Heck I should contact the manufacturer
and maybe I could have them made with TYPE 2 PARTS molded in. After this
experience I went on the mount hunt to see if I could at least find OEM
mounts and I did. I got GENUINE VW, OEM, mounts that are made in MEXICO. Are
these better, can't say yet, but I do have them out there and on my own
VW's, so they are being tested and I will have the results on my next engine
pull.

The point is, WHAT IS BETTER? Brazilian heads assembled in Germany useing
Taiwan parts or VW Factory heads made and assembled in Brazil useing all OEM
VW Brazilian parts? Reboxed INDIA parts with Germany stamped on them or OEM
VW Mexican parts. If a part is made at or for VW it seems the quaility would
be as good as an ORIGINAL VW German part and more then likely better then a
GERMAN REPO. Pay the price for ATE brake hoses (German) or get OEM Mexican
hoses for 40 per-cent less? The choice is yours and these are just my
observations being in the parts biz and trying to tell it like it is.

We in the US are suckers for brand names. We think.
for example, that Budweiser is better than Coors,
even though they are nearly identical. Half of us
think that Coke is better than Pepsi, while the
other half think the opposite. Yes there are 
differences, but it is like arguing about the
aesthetic properties of two shades of turquoise.
There is a detectable difference, but does it really
matter? But I am not saying that it never matters,
because I have eaten Food Lion macaroni and cheese.

Which gets me to parts. On many of the popular vendor
websites, you find a part listed for $X, and a similar
GERMAN part listed for $X + 25%. The implication is
that the GERMAN part is always better. Can we really
go by the reputation of a country? Could not Crapmaster
Industries open a plant in Germany and pump out stamped
pot-metal parts faster than, uh..., something than 
stamps out pot-metal parts really fast? National Pride 
notwithstanding, certainly there are some German factory 
workers willing to forsake their engineering heritage 
to make a quick Deutsch Mark. How can I tell if the
part is worth the extra money? Should I insist on 
a brand name?
