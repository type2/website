Subject: [T2] Re: roof racks (long)


(long and involves drilling, no flames please)

Tim,

I installed Yakima racks on my '70 Westy poptop and have carried a kayak and
sometimes a bike everywhere for 3 years.  Requires drilling and reinforcing
the poptop.

I bought 2 pr. of the &quot;bolt-on sideloaders&quot; that are basically a small steel
section (pretends to be a raingutter that the racks clamp to on regular
cars).  They are made for pickup truck fiberglass caps or applications such
as this.  Cost $25/pr.  So there are 2 on each side of the poptop.  I had
heard that the fiberglass would crack from the load if not reinforced (makes
sense,eh) so I put a 4 ft. section of 1x2 on the hidden side of the poptop
to bolt through.  Also requires 8 longer carriage bolts than the ones that
come with the kits.  No cracks so far from heavy use.

where the x's are where the bolts go through the poptop and reinforcing wood
and the 0's are the crossbars.  I can send a picture if you wish.

I am not familiar with the late poptops so not sure how that would work.
On the early poptops it is VERY difficult to raise it and requires about 120
lb. of lifting with the kayak on top.  And also is more load than the hinges
or supports were designed to take--but so far nothing has broken.

If you go with Yakima's you want the 1A raingutter towers ($110) and a pair
of crossbars ($42)--well worth the investment if you carry things up there
often.  I had them leftover from another vehicle.  For a picture of the
sideloaders:

(Thule brand are comparable quality.  Also consider lock cores so your racks
don't get stolen).  They also sell the fru-fru accessories for kayaks but
all you really need are the basic towers and crossbars.

They also sell High rise towers that might clear your poptop, if they are
tall enough they would not require drilling, and also work with hardtop
buses:

the roof!

Used racks are available all over ebarf, search for yakima.  You could get a
deal on the expensive towers and buy the hard-to-ship crossbars locally.

&gt; Hello,
&gt;      I have done some research without any good
&gt; results about roof racks.  I am looking for one that
&gt; would secure a kayak on my 77 pop top.  I remember
&gt; another VW owner saying that the yakima one that he
&gt; had worked great for his surf board, but I'm not sure
&gt; which kind to get since I have a pop top.  If anyone
&gt; else has something like this I would really appreciate
&gt; some help.  Thanks a lot.
