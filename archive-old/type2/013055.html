Subject: Broken fuel sender wire

Did you put a ohm meter on it and work it
through it's range? You should see a pretty
smooth meter movement when you do this. If the
meter doesnt respond smoothly as you move the
float then the sender has dead spots. Old senders
can work differently depending on their spatial
orientation.
I suspect that is due to the pressure contact of the
sweeper arm degrades over time and the mechanics
get sloppy....

-------------------------------------
Naturally, after cutting a hole in
the hatch, I've determined the sender
is fine. I've shorted out the gauge
and got it to move, so I assume it's
ok as well.
-------------------------------------- 

&gt;&gt;More than likely at the push on connector.
With the wire off at both ends you could attach one end to
ground and check and see if
you are getting zero ohms to ground at the other.
if you are, of course, the wire is good. If not then
the wire has a problem. &lt;&lt;
__________________________________________
Do I try to find where the wire is broken?
If so, where is it most likely to be?
------------------------------------------- 

&gt;&gt;Seems to me the only mech. stress points on this wire
would be at the spade connectors.&lt;&lt;
-------------------------------------------- 
This seems to be one of those &quot;I've see it
break there 100 times&quot; sort of questions :)
-----------------------------------------------

When I replaced my sender I installed a round, removeable
access hatch. Marine supply house. Get one with a O ring
seal on the bulkead so that the screw in &quot;plug&quot; seals.
Because the back deck isnt flat you have to use a &quot;gasket&quot;
material between the bulkhead and the deck to get a good
seal. Mine is 6&quot; port hole.

Regular naps prevent old age.....
especially if you take them while driving.
