Subject: exhaust manifold
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hi, I have a '75 bus which I just managed to unscrew the nuts off the exhaust 
manifold of my bus. Thing is, the right side of the exhaust have 3 out of 4 
of the nuts stucked to the screw which i ended up removing the nut along with 
the screw. The other side on the left side, has only 1/4 of which the screw 
came out along with the nut. 
Now my trouble is to get the left side off the engine block. it is stuck 
there. Could I get some advice on what my next step should be. I like to 
change the sealings on the exhaust manifold. Leaks coming from there are 
suspected.
