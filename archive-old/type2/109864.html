Subject: Re: [T2] CHT location change?

I have to agree with Greg... and I can add that I have changed a number of
plugs ,, or done compression testing  with that sensor on the #3 plug in
different vehicles,,, dual carb and efi engines.

I remember I was very aprehensive the first time I seen one,,, but IMHO,
it is the only place to put the sensor... everyone else with very few
exceptions have them under the #3 plug, and so comparison readings are
much easier to make.

But the best part by far is the ease of re-installing that plug with the
sensor holding it and the socket in place.

&gt; Personally, I found the install to be a piece of cake. I put the spark
&gt; plug into the socket, bent the connector tongue carefully around the
&gt; socket and then used the sensor wire to ensure the plug couldn't fall
&gt; out of the socket while I was fishing around under there to line up
&gt; with the spark plug hole. Once it's bent to fit around the socket it
&gt; should stay that way, and will be no problem to remove the next time
&gt; you change plugs.

&gt; I haven't changed a plug with it yet, but I really don't think it will
&gt; be that much of a hassle and I find the peace-of-mind I get from
&gt; accurate engine data is well worth it.
