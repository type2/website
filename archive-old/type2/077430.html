Subject: idle in D problem after car is warm.

     I have noticed a problem with the my 79 Westy (automatic,FI) that
started Tuesday of this week. It starts great  - 22 Degrees Celsius - No
prob! (as long as the block heater is plugged in). I let it warm up for a
good 10 minutes and she starts off fine. About 5 - 10 minutes into driving,
I will get stopped by a light or traffic sign and the bus will idle real
rough, the generator light will then flicker and the bus will shake. Not
good. Up until now I have been able to drop her into neutral and give her
some gas but the problem is getting worse quickly. This morning I held up
traffic for 10 minutes because she outright stalled on me. Actually the bus
stalled again before I arrived at work. Does anyone have any ideas where to
start? It is too cold outside to just mess around and see what the hell
might be wrong so if someone could point me in the right direction that
would be great.
