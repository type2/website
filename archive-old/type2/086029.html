Subject: slammed busses

Hello all,

     I am the proud owner of a &quot;slammed&quot; bus.  I have a Bus Boys adjustable 
front beam and the garage that installed it adjusted it quite low.  Slammed 
is the word.  If I hit a big bump...Slam! the front end bottoms out, then 
Slam!, my head hits the ceiling.  If I leave  a steep parking lot too fast, 
Slam! goes the belly pan on the pavement.  It does look very nice.  My 
theory is that with a front end lowered this much, the shocks are already 
very compressed and do not travel enough to build up a dampening effect.  
Basically, I need to get it up on a real lift and adjust it to proper ride 
height.  I will not get under my bus with jack stands.  I am paranoid about 
the bus falling on me, so I will have to find a garage that will humor me 
and do this adjustment.  My other theory is that the garage never properly 
installed the torsion bars and that's why the front end is so squishy.
Has anybody had similar experiences.....?  Any good solutions....

BTW, I am happy with the Bus Boys beam.  I bought it to replace my old rusty 
beam.  It is just that it is adjusted wrong and I never got around to 
dealing with it....and yes, I kinda like the way the lowered front end 
looks...

Thanks, James.
