If they are made in anywhere other than Germany, I would suspect them.
You are asking about a thermostat for a 72 w/ a 1700 type4 engine,
right?
Last week I checked w/ my local VW DEALER for these parts and found the
following:
021 119 159a thermostat  		        $49.95	
021 119 751  cable                                4.00
021 119 765 union(nut to connect above 2 parts)   3.05
021 119 175 thermostat washer                     2.00
021 119 955 seal washer (around cable thru tin)   1.10

These are all  needed to install a thermostat in such a motor. The
thermostat is a little pricey, but I'm sure it would be German and last
a long time. GOOD bus shops probably have German thermostats for less.
