Subject: RE: cooling flaps on T2

This might have answered my question about the amount of force used to open
the flaps. Maybe mine is fine now. If I push on the tab that holds the cable,
the flaps open and close smoothly, but without a lot of force. Enough that I
thought they were working. I currently do not have the cable hooked up since
the screw is stripped, hope to fix that today and get this thermostat issue
fixed.

thanks for the help,
Corbett

&gt;I can take my thumb and push on the tab that holds the cable; this will
&gt;let you test their closing. You can also put a visegrip on the bar
&gt;holding the flaps and rack it back and forward to test its motion-
&gt;easiest before you do the hookup of cable or after it's really warmed up
&gt;and fully open.
