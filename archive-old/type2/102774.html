Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Tank

&gt;Is there no way to service these column senders, or to retrofit with one of
&gt;the float type? I don't think that the float type would be matched to the
&gt;guage.

Since I have a '70 and a '71, I'll enter the fray.  How much modification 
does it require to change the tank from an early bay(upright) to a 
late(pancake)?  If the senders are nearing extinction, then what is the 
alternative, other than replacing the tank itself?  Anyone?  TIA.

	Eron
