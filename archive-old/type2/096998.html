Subject: Original Service manual

Hi Volks- Cleaned out my garage (at least I started) and found an
original , orange covered, service manual for late model bays to 78. It
is in good shape and contains the repair and troubleshooting guide for
the Campmobile.  It does not have the colored wiring diagrams. I paid
35.00 for it and would like to get my money back and I'll pay for
shipping. If anyone wants it, let me know. TBear
