Subject: Re: [T2] A-Arm Bushing Replacement???

I done it again, not explaining myself.  I mean the Rear A-Arm bushing.  The
round one that the bolt goes through to bolt it to the frame.  I'm doing an
IRS Conversion on a SplitWindow and the one Bushing, from the 69 Arm,just
seems a bit worn. I'm hoping it's the Bushing and not the Arm that's causing
the problem.  I bought the only 68-70 Rear A-Arms around my local area that
were reasonable?  Anyone have an extra left side one they'd sale?

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Has anyone replaced the A-Arm bushing before?  I assume they press in?
&gt; &gt;I'm looking for a way to get the old out and the new ones in without
&gt; &gt;having to take them to a shop to be pressed out and new in.

&gt; Dave,
&gt; I take it you mean the front beam/control arm bushings?  Are these things
&gt; even available anymore?  I thought I saw a note on a retailers' site that
&gt; they were NLA.  If you find a source for them, please let us all know.
&gt; Thanks.
