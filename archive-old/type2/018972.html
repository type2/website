Is anyone out in listland going to the Beaver Springs show tomorrow,
Sunday 10/17?  I live in Annapolis and would be interested in driving up
with anyone making the trek there.  If it's not raining, I'll probably
be going up in my 73 Bug, otherwise I will share the $$ or driving time
to go up with someone else.  I guess the third choice is that I'll be
driving up in the wife's h*nd_at_ station wagon...
