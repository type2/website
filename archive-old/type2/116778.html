Subject: Re: [T2] I'm gonna pull my engine

&gt;just remember the bus only needs to be jacked up
&gt;enough for you to climb underneath and disconnect.&gt;&gt;
&gt;Heat Exchangers,

I have a 71 and I've dropped my engine twice and I never jacked it up. I 
used the Bentely procedure for dropping the engine but the Muir should 
suffice. It's actually pretty straightforward. Unbolting the engine from the 
tranny is a little bit of a pain.
