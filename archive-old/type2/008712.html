Volks,       What is, in your opinion, the best torque wrench to own that
is applicable to most VW work.   All my sockets are 3/8 drive, but if a
1/2 inch drive torque is better, then I'd just load up on 1/2 inch
sockets.  I notice that the 3/8 wrench goes from about 5 to 80 ft/lbs.,
whereas the 1/2 goes from 25 to 250.  Which one would be a better
purchase, and if I go for the 1/2 inch drive, then what about the proper
torques below 25 ft/lbs.?  I can't afford both.

                         TIA,        Kevin  Snow
