Subject: Bus camping fans

High yourself to a boating store and look for the cageless Caframo fans-
they move a lot of air for the power they consume.  They used to be made
in Canada but the company kowtowed to the almighty profit margin and
they are now made in China with cheaper sleeve bearing that is noisier. 
The fan itself is quieter, as their 120 volt model will prove. 
Brookstone or Sharper image may sell these also.
