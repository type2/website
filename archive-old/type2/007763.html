First time for me to do valve clearances.  I read the idiot's guide.  It’s different.  My distributor has no lining up notch to indicate cylinder one.  My fanbelt pulley has three cuts close together at one end and none elsewhere.  I follow my HT cables back from the plugs and note that number one goes to top right on the distributor.  Number two to top left.  Number Three bottom left.  Number four bottom right.  I checked that of the three notches together on the pulley, using the one on the left I can get it at the engine casing crack and have the rotor showing number one top right.  So I guess that I can then do my clearances as per the book.  Need I worry about the different positions from the book?  
My main question is that to make an adequate mark 180 degrees opposite to the factory cut on the fan pulley is difficult due to it’s position in the engine bay.  I’ve done my best with a ruler and a guess, but there is no way I can see of getting it really accurate.  So, I can line up with the factory mark for 1 and 3, but 2 and 4 will have to be on my mark.  If this is out will it mean so are my clearances for 2 and 4?  Is there a better way?  I won’t adjust until I hear from someone from the list.  Also, any hints on removing old gasket sealant?  Solvents, scrapers?  Thanks for the help in the recent past, I will get back to those that replied and let you know how it went.  Without welding I would not have a bus.
