&amp;gt; While it's still Friday, can we entertain Clara's question about
&amp;gt; recombining the lists? Or maybe permitting all air-cooled bus

&amp;gt; accepted the latter, the VB list could stay up for anyone who can't
&amp;gt; handle the traffic or loathe baywindows.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; I miss the VB people, Clara especially.

As the owner of a baywindow with a type 1 engine I sidestep the problem
by simply subscribing to both lists.  I see everything, but those who
don't want to see bay or split traffic still have the option to view only
what they want to see.
