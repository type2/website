Subject: ADMIN: Re: [T2] VW Hippie Bashing

As the first shift admin, I probably should have put this thread to bed.
Unfortunately, AP tests are looming and I didn't get a chance to do so.

In any case, Friday is nearly over, so please kill this thread at the
stroke of midnight.

George Lyle, list admin, first shift
