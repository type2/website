Subject: Engine Rebuild Question

I've been slowly working on an engine rebuild (my first) and have a
question about replacing pistons. I read that if I am going to replace
the pistons that I should also replace the cylinders as well. I this
true? I know that my rings were bad and I was burning oil but I don't
really detect any scratches or the like on the cylinder walls (ie.
evidence of seizing). There is however a bit of burnt oil residue
towards the top of each cylinder. Is it just a standard procedure to
replace everything? Can anyone give me the skinny on this?



Thanks,
