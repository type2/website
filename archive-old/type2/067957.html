Subject: Re: Expedient Parts Washer

&gt;Due to the elimination of ozone depleting substances, businesses are 
&gt;using a fancy version of a dishwasher for cleaning parts.  I've been 
&gt;wondering the same thing as West.  Thinking about getting a used 
&gt;washer and set it up in the garage for cleaning parts only. 
 &lt;snip&gt;

&gt;Now, what does one USE in the dishwasher as a cleaning agent?
&gt;Another question for the environmentally friendly.  What would this 
&gt;do to my septic system? (I'm out in the boonies) and conversely what 
&gt;would this do to centralized sewage treatment? (It probably can 
&gt;handle it without much problem, is my guess)
&gt;

  Yes , this is the thread I was referring to or wish to pursue.

 For argument sake , I have cleaned the parts in parts cleaner and 
got all the crud off. Now I want a hot water detergent wash with a 
metal brightener in it.

 At best it will be a caustic soution and have some residue of 
oil/ grease .

 This is describing a load of dirty dishes so far but how far can I
push these chemicals before the internal gaskets go and the septic
blows up.

 Maybe a holding tank out there where the washer dumps while I treat 
the stuff to neutralize.

 I don't thnk I'd be talking a solvent bath at all.
