Subject: Busdom in S.D

Hi everyone...just wanted to let u all know, for 
those who r concerned, that i've picked up the 
rainbow wagon and have gotten her home to iowa.
haven't gotten a chance yet to look over her and 
diagnose the prob. sore as can be, after the 
long adventure. and just haven't gotten together 
enough to craw under her to check things out. 
we're kyndof short on time here, so i'm not sure 
if i'll get to report back with my findings, 
before we leave for the rainbow gathering. 
but i'll make sure to repost our busdom thread 
and our results when we get back in from the 
uppper penninsula. 
i'm sure i'll be in need of some more advice, 
when in get around to fixin her. 
but i just wanted to thank everyone, for their 
time and attention spent on helpin us out. 
unfortunately, bussie wont be makin it to the 
gathering this year. but she's happy, and we're 
happy, to get her to a safe place to hibernate 
for a few weeks. 
anyways..we're off to spend some time in the 
wilderness. get to play and dance to the break 
of dawn, for the next few weeks. waaahoooo...!!!
much love and a gr8ful peace out to you and 
yours, *SHINE ON* -Chris (70'Westie)
