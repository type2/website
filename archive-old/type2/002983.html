Well the first warm day of summer &amp; the list went alive with the good old
&quot;Is my oil O.K, what is the general opinion of the list?&quot; punctuated by the
faithful hole filler,&quot;What tires should I use?&quot;.

But I here you say &quot;You sentimental fool! What about now?&quot;. Well last year
the same as this year echoing across 5 decades, several frozen digits &amp; a
misty wind-shield the immortal question:-

&quot;WHAT ABOUT HEAT!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;

Tales of frozen significant others muttering unspeakable suggestions
involving F*RD's &amp; water cooled engines, I'm sure will follow. Along these
lines &quot;What oil should I use in winter?&quot; will rise up &amp; defy the great &amp;
holy FAQ. Even the  diverse &quot;What tires are good in snow?&quot; will cause our
resident swimsuit model to set his latest Terry Prachet asunder, to vent his
anger on the defier of both the great &amp; holy FAQ, but the inspired word of
charter!

 Yay! though you walk in the valley of Scrap yard, you will not find a
working BA6. Nor will you find the secrets of the fuel metering system, for
it is written &quot;The last git will destroy traces of a mint BA6 while getting
that 50 pence rubber bung from the scrap yard&quot;. And may God have mercy on
your soles! (coz there gonna FREEEEEZ!).

B.T.W

&gt;SMUG MODE ON&lt;

Mrwhipy has 2 new heat exchangers, a newly installed &amp; serviced BA6 with
auxiliary blower (with timer working), a fully insulated heater duct &amp;
cabin, new door rubbers all round &amp; a balanced flue propane heater just in
case!

&gt;SMUG MODE OFF&lt;


A-A-A-Ahhh!, I see you turning green!

(Australians &amp; members from warmer countries DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT!)

BTW

Fragrant nappies ahoy! Cameron's on solids (whew!)
