Oooh, never thought about that... Yeah, I've dealt with some fisheyed paint before... 

&lt;These waxes are usually advertised
to last for long peiods of time and, by gum, they do!  That is both their
blessing and their curse.  If you choose to use a silicon-base wax, be
prepared for auto-body HELL the next time you need any paint applied to
your bus!&gt;
