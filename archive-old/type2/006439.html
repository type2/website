I've re-plumbed/rebuilt fuel systems on just about anything that runs an I/C
engine, and have always found just what I needed in the way of valves and
fittings at a NAPA store.

Another good source is a commercial marine supply outfit, but you'll usually
pay a premium price for the same parts since they are &quot;marine quality&quot;
despite identical part numbers, etc. :-)

Either way you can find brass or bronze valves and fittings to do the job,
using whatever style of connections you prefer.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  One easy place to get any kind of fuel system part including fuel line
and high quality valves is a company called Aircraft Spruce and Specialty
Co.  I know this because I am into airplane building.  They have a catalog
an inch thick!  They have a web site at www.aircraft-spruce_dot_com .

I have often thought it would be a great idea to install a fuel valve
between the tank and the fuel pump and filter to avoid getting another fuel
bath.  &lt;&lt;
