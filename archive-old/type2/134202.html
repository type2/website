Subject: Subject: Bob Hoover - off topic - sort of

I have also wondered if that's the same Bob Hoover. I also wonder why he 
left the list if anyone on here remembers? I've read his sermons- very 
interesting. He does mention aircraft engines.  Tom


&lt; Subject: Bob Hoover - off topic - sort of
 I'm listening to some vintage Paul Harvery episodes while I work.

He's got one episode all about Bob Hoover...

This Bob Hoover is/was quite a pilot.

Is that the same Bob Hoover that used to educate us here so often at Type 2? 
I sure learned alot from Bob.

Whatever happened to him? I remember the high emotions though I don't 
remember the causes.

Thanks.

Chris&gt;
