Subject: Auto Trans Gremlins

Hello All knowing,
I had a clicking in the rear end, and based on solid advice, I installed
re-built CV and axles.
Well, low and behold, I still have a click coming from the drivers side axle
assembly.

Now what??

This is a 78 Auto transmission.

Kind Regards,

Frank E Biffath III
