Subject: Re: [T2] A new micro?  Don't think so!

&gt; Can't say that I'm impressed by the new Bug, but the Mini is a pretty
&gt; good car in it's own right. I'm still waiting for a ride so I can compare
&gt; memories of my old 1275 Mini...Point and squirt!

On this point, my wife wants to trade her 01 waterbug in on a new mini.
I saw a blue and white one with a union jack painted on the whole roof.
sweet.
huh huh. huh huh.
