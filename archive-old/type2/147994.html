Subject: R&amp;R engine peripheral bits

After I had the engine rebuilt several years ago it occurred to me 
that all the peripheral bits (distributor, alternator, fuel pump, 
etc) have also done the same (probably obscenely high) mileage and 
haven't been touched. I suspect that they are often overlooked and 
cause lots of unnecessary grief when they are fairly easy to fix or 
replace. My latest forays have been the fuel pump and the alternator. 
I discovered the mechanical fuel pump was on the way out when I went 
to twin weber ict carbs from a single weber progressive and the old 
pump couldn't keep up. I have replaced it with a Carter rotary 
electric fuel pump (connected via a relay to the alternator light) 
and have got back my previous &quot;performance&quot; level. Now I can try 
dialling in the jetting. With the old fuel pump there was no 
difference for idle jets from 55 to 65!

Replacing the fuel pump brought to a head the alternator output 
problem I'd been ignoring for years! It was a little bit fiddly to 
get the alternator out, but very easy to fix it. I replaced the 
bearings using a home made jig ( couple of nuts and bolts, a few 
large washers and a piece of angle aluminium) to pull the old ones 
and sanded the grooves out of the slip rings. The brushes were ok. 
What a difference! Now I can turn on everything electrical I can find 
and still be making well over 12v!

So the lesson for today is get out there and r&amp;r those peripheral bits!

Cheers,

Martin.
