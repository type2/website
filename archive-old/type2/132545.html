Subject: VIN swap (was Jay Leno)

A swap of VINs and titles between buses -- 76-79 California VINs for 
74-75 VINs from out of state -- is probably against some kind of law. 
On the other hand, the number of buses in completely original condition 
is a tiny fraction of all buses. We've changed out the engines, the 
mechanicals, turned campers into kombis and kombis into campers, cut 
holes in roofs, swapped seats, and welding in vast new quantities of 
steel. It seems to me that swapping VINs and titles, maybe with a 
&quot;consideration&quot; for the trouble, is simply a way of saving some work 
and gasoline in swapping actual buses, which is perfectly legal.

Besides, most of us in California who bought a 76-79 did so because we 
expected the exemption. Otherwise, we would have bought 75 or earlier.
