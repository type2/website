Subject: RE: [T2] free 77---&gt; actually a 78!  bus Update

I can think of a lot of things I'd like to give my ex-wife.  But a  VW bus wouldn't be one of them.  Then that's another road best not  travelled; with or without a front-mounted spare.  Cheers...KR

I was looking a gift horse in the mouth.  Sorry all. 
I'm very fortunate to have been given the opportunity
to keep this T2 alive, and I appreciate Matthew for
all of his work.  And, the new owner of the bus spent
time today cleaning the interior.  So she is showing
interest.
