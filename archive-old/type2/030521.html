Subject: JC whitney heat shield insulation
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.21.0008210930540.70791-100000_at_zarf_dot_org&gt;

Hi all,

I want to insulate the headliner area in my bus, and have found this
material from JC whitney, its grey padding with an aluminum sheet on one
side.

I want to glue it to the roof with the silver side toward the roof and the
grey side down(facing passenger area), i think this will be best but want
some input, here is my rationale:

- silver side toward the roof reflects heat back up
- silver stuff wont hold water so it will keep any moisture in the padding
away from my steel
- grey side down will look better until i can get a headliner put in...
(though a &quot;mirrored' celing _could_ be entertaining... for about 10
minutes)

Anyone agree/disagree or have any input at all?

thanks,

Steve
