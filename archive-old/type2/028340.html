&gt; I ordered two repro tail lights for my 68 in January from Ron. I got the
&gt; last ONE he had in stock, and his source had dried up. But today, after
&gt; working in the rain all day, I came home and found 2 boxes from Bus Depot.
&gt; One had some bug parts, the other the long-backordered tail light! Thanks
&gt; Ron!
&gt;
&gt; Talk about brightening my day (Christmas in September)! Must be from a
&gt; different source, it appears to be of much heavier stock then the
&gt; first one. If you need (want) these, I'd advise you to check with Ron
ASAP.
&gt; I know why it finally came...just this weekend we were talking
&gt; about pulling the original one off and trying some chrome silver spray
paint


Yes, they were on international backorder for almost a year!!!  I was
starting to wonder whether I'd ever see them again at all.  But last week I
found some, and immediately filled backorders. I do have some more left to
ship at this point, but not too many, so if anyone needs them you should
probably move fast.  So far I'm honoring my most recent advertised price of
$29.95 each including lenses.  Not sure how long I can hold that price,
though, as my cost on this shipment was way too high.  Then again, any price
is meaningless if they go on backorder again. :-(   Incidentally, these fit
'63-71.
