Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] RE: [VB] Hubcap Idea

&gt;&gt;&gt; ......What if we start a second hubcap around the country this
&gt;&gt;&gt; year.  I'd love to be involved in it, since this is the first
&gt;&gt;&gt; year I'll have my Bus out.  I'd start it off and either paint
&gt;&gt;&gt; one, start a stock one (think my chrome ones are
&gt;&gt;&gt; aftermarket) or what ever,
&gt;
&gt; I think if at all possible that we should try to find the original  
&gt; one and
&gt; get it moving again.

The last time I saw it, &quot;Big Mike&quot; had it at the 2003 RMMW show in  
Colorado along w/ his &quot;show&quot; Bay window westy.
It was the domed version- I have pics, but they are blurred, or not  
close up.

Tom B-where's the hubcap?
&gt;
&gt;&gt; existing one is the pre-1971 domed version or the post-1971 flat  
&gt;&gt; version,
&gt;&gt; but whichever it is, I'd suggest using the other version for the  
&gt;&gt; second one,
&gt;&gt; to easily distinguish them, and so that we cover all years.
