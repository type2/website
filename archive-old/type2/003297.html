&gt;Maybe you can answer a question. Is a 215mm flywheel on a 914 1.8 the same
&gt;as a 215mm flywheel on a 74 bus 1.8? I know the clutches are totally
&gt;different. The 914 uses Porsche part numbers. The 914 flwheel uses a VW part
&gt;number. I called the Porsche dealer yesterday morning and all I could get
&gt;out of the parts guy was the flywheel part #, 022 105 273A.
&gt;Near as I can find out about the bus flywheel: I believe the 215mm bus part
&gt;# is 021 105 271H. I am certain the bus 2.0L 228mm flywheel is # 022 102
&gt;271D.
&gt;Why would the 914 215mm flywheel start with a 022 number?
&gt;Why is the last 3 numbers 273 instead of 271?

Karl-
for general reference, in &quot;porsche&quot; #'s:
group # 021 is 1.7 origin
group # 022 is 1.8 origin
group # 039 is 2.0  origin
Just one of life's little quirks, i guess- unless they had a plan .
As in vw, the earlier # points to the origin of the part, and the
suffix letter points to a modification, or update, or improvement.
just as in vw , where you will find a part start with 111, as the
origin of that part was a beetle ,even though it is being used on a bus.

bus 1.7L               210 mm-  021105 271
bus 1.8                215 mm -  022 105 271A ( *not  021, not H )
bus 2.0                228 mm-   029 105 271   ( * not  022 102 271D )
914( one size fits all 4-cyl )-   022 105 273A

The 914 flywheel differs from the bus part in that the flywheel teeth are
.125&quot; closer to the transaxle. this will cause the starter to jam.

I'm not sure i answered your question- what was it again ?
