I just got a new master cylinder our 68 and unfortunately it is different
&gt;from the original from the original,  The original had three sensors and the
new one only has 2.  I looked in the RMMW catalog and it lists it as the
right master cylinder but I'm not sure how to rewire it so the warning
lights work properly.
Please email me back personally and I'll send the results to the list.
Mike
