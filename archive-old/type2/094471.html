Subject: Re: [T2] washer resevoir time release!!!!

&gt; Tonight I pumped up my washer bottle to 20 psi
&gt; and around 3 hours later I was drinking a few
&gt; with the neighbor and all of a sudden I heard a
&gt; hissing sound and here comes all the washer
&gt; water all over the drive way. Leaks look like they
&gt; are coming from just behind the bumper where
&gt; the lines go into the front face of the bus. Any one
&gt; ever heard of such crazy crap?? Why the time
&gt; release and all of the fluid at once???? Please
&gt; help me believe I'm not loosing my mind!!!!!

All the rubber and plastics are over 30 years old.  The same thing happened
to me: I pressurized the system before I went for a vehicle inspection test
and it hissed at me from the steering column for the first time and squirted
all over the carpet.
