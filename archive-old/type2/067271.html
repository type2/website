&gt;I'm sure everyone will appreciate the price of the Muir book at this
&gt;address.  Check out:

&gt;http://www.amazon_dot_com/exec/obidos/cache/spotlight.html/1760-2603286-261209

&gt;Wait for the whole page to load (it's kind of long w/14.4).  The Muir
&gt;bible is at the very bottom.  
&gt;


FWIW, I sell the Muir book to list members by mail for the very same price 
($20).

For those avid readers out there, this seems to be a very nice online 
bookstore, though. Nice search function, and, if the Muir book is a typical 
example, good prices.
