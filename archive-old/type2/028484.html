Using my fav...Valvoline Moly grease, I would,

A. check the fit of the seals preferably before installing...you did grease
the hub and seal lips right?
B. check the fit of the end cap...they get boogered up by carelessness...a
little brake clean and a bead of silicone upon assembly can accommodate a
bad fit.
C. adjust the bearings correctly...don't cinch down on the nut more than
finger tight...after making sure the bearings are seated, back off and
retighten by hand and you'll be about right. The thrust washer is supposed
to move under gentle nudging. A lot of guys just reef on the adjustment
nut...those poor bearings!
D. Check for brake drag (calipers sticking?) or driver riding the
brakes...slow down and take it easy

Subject: [T2] Bearing Grease

I recently replaced the front wheel bearings and grease seals on my '79
westy and packed the hubs with a high temperature wheel bearing grease from
my local FLAPS.  This grease seems to flow out from under the hubcaps when
I drive and makes a mess underneath the hubcaps and eventually on the rims
outside of the hubcaps.  What's up with that?

Does anyone know of a good wheel bearing grease that resists flow due to
the combined effects of heat and centrifugal force?
