Greetings VW clan:

The best way to protect your precious Westy is to live in a low crime area.  I live in a
pretty little, tree-shaded, university town in the northern Idaho Panhandle.  Compared to
most places, it is pretty much &quot;Back to the 50's&quot;.  Kids can play in the parks, and there
are no discarded needles.  Our &quot;crime rate&quot; is a joke.  About once a month some kid rips
off a bicycle, and nearly always gets turned in.  Collkege kids sometimes throw loud
parties in an apartment complex, and are told by our local police to tone it down...

We don't even lock our cars when we park downtown or at the mall.  No one can even
remember the last time a car of any marque was stolen in our area.  Hell, my family and I
went to Yellowstone for four months a couple of years ago, on a research sabbatical, and
we left our house unlocked!  And that was because we always do...

But if you are not so fortunate in your locale, you can go to Radio Shack and get a cheap
little &quot;motion sensor&quot; alarm that operates on batteries, and sit it up on the little,
long,  storage ledge above the back closet, where the front cot lives.  It makes an
ungodly shriek when it goes off.

Don Kaag
(...and Brunhilda, the green and white '73 Westy Wonderbus [...who just had her front
wheel arches replaced, and her minor dings removed, with an aqua green acrilic enamel
&quot;lower half&quot; repaint, and looks lovely...])
