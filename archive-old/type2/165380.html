  longish  story

Hi mark,

Coming down for John Brown's Buses 2006 I drove from BuffaloNY -  
Bedford MD and home to Toronto ON, on three cylinders, that's about  
800 miles.

&gt; Take the push rod out for the valve that has problems,  disconnect the
&gt; injector for that clylinder and drive it home.  I drove my  59  
&gt; panel 250 miles like
&gt; that once.   I now have AAA that tows up to  100 miles .  later
