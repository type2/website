Subject: Re: [T2] I think my handle is opening backwards?

&gt;Seems the indentations in the door would suggest that you would 
&gt;pull it up. However, on my Bus, you pull the handle down. 

You pull it down to open it.  I don't know about other year models, but on
my 73, unless I slam the snot out of it (which I don't do), when I pull the
handle all the way up it locks the rear latch into place - you can hear it
click and you see the rear edge of the door pull slightly better into place.
