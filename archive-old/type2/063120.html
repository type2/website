Ooooh!!! Another Seattlite potshot at LALALand!

So the third (or is it fourth) biggest city in the US is sniping
at the 6th biggest re. quality of life? Are you suggesting that one
from the City in the Rain would have to endure savage deprivations
to endure a visit to somewhere like Santa Cruz or Santa Barbara? ;-) 

Well relax, the Starbucks Empirial Forces have installed themselves on most of 
our streetcorners. You'll hardly know the difference and when you find the
bus of your dreams, you won't have to scrape moss out of the raingutters. ;-) 

Just don't get caught using a 45 in a 38 caliber zone. ;-&gt;
