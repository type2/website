Subject: kool patch

Hey everyone,

I've been looking in my area for kool seal's kool patch.  It is the
roofing seal that is used in the Heat, Rust &amp; Noise process.  They
don't have it at Home Depot, Lowes or the Sears around here.  They
have all the other kool seal products, but not kool patch.  

Anybody know where you can get it in the DC area?  I am in Suburban
Maryland.

thanks,
Edwin Knuth
