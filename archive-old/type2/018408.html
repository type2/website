So what's this anti-GEX stuff I keep reading about?  Has their quality
fallen down?

Hubby's bug has a 1600 GEX purchased about 15 years ago, that has almost
200,000 miles on it--he still uses it to commute to work . . .He has
quite religious 'bout changing the oil every 2,000-2500 miles or so.

He popped it in 3 days before we left on a tour of the United States and
through Canada to alaska, about 14,000 miles in all.  He made the
mistake of replacing the flywheel that came with the engine with a stock
flywheel, and it started to throw oil in New mexico--where the GEX
flywheel fits into where ever it fits into had been made a little larger
and the flywheel hubby put on was a little smaller.  We limped into
Tuscon and had a flywheel like the original GEX one expressed out to us,
then we continued on our way.  Oh, he did drop the engine in Tok, AK to
torque the heads, but that was it!

Sounds like we shouldn't be counting on GEX anymore, especially for our
vans. . .
