Subject: RE: Re: [T2] 74 westy interior question

&gt;you have a standard westy, only deluxes had powered fridges and stoves, so you are all good. there are advantages to 
&gt;the standard setup too, its way lighter

Just wondering if there was something missing, that's all.  I didn't want a deluxe.  Actually I would prefer a poptop weekender arrangement, perhaps with a rear facing jumpseat (68-73 westy?) or two in place of the kitchen cabinetry all together.  I'll cook outside, thanks.  And a cooler can be removed when necessary.  Anyone need an icebox or sink cabinet?
