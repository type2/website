Subject: Re: [T2] heater cables

Ouch!!! If you can, push them back through and clip off the bent up ends 
with a side cutter. No malformed wire to pull through. If there is 
restriction and you can't get the new ones through, spray some liquid 
wrench in one end of the tube, then blow it into the tube. Let it soak. 
Blast it clean with air. Repeat until the buildup of crud is removed and 
the new cable end will pass.
