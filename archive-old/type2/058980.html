Subject: VW-Looking for help in Ft. Worth TX area

  From: &quot;Chevier, Steve (REU)&quot; &lt;CHEVIERS_at_REU.RELTECCORP.COM&gt;
  I am attempting to yank the 1600sp out of my
  '69 campmobile and I have loosened or
  removed all but the two bolts on the top
  of the tranny.  I am now at the point where
  I need some help for about an hour or so.
  I need someone to help balance the engine
  on my floor jack while I cr  awl under and remove
  the last of the bolts.  I will then need help after
  I attach my engine stand to hoist it up to my work
  bench.

Steve:

Though I can appreciate your need for someone to commiserate with while
screwing around with the damned Bus, you really don't need anyone to help
you take it out or put it in (though the latter operation is made a bit
easier with another pair of eyes).  Extraction of a Bus engine is a one
person operation unless you count the good samaritan that brings you beer
on command.

The trick is to use two jacks:  A cheap sissor jack (about $15) and a
cheap floor jack with wheels (about $30 on sale).  Put the sissor jack
under than transmission and crank it up until it just lifts the combined
engine-tranny unit.  Put the *wheeled* floor jack with the lever facing to
the rear and the little rounded dish on the jack cranked up to the point
where it touches the oil sump plate.  I assume that you've removed the
bumper, the rear deck, and detached the wires and hoses.  At this point,
the only thing holding the engine in place is the nuts on the two bolts on
the bottom-front of the engine that go through the tranny, the upper-right
side starter bolt with the nut inside the engine compartment (which is made
infinitely easier to get the nut on and off with a 17mm ratcheting box
wrench), the upper-left bolt that screws into the welded-on nut on the
engine (if you are lucky), and the two bolts that screw into the rear
engine carrier (actually, the tranny shaft provides support as well but we
don't count it).

If you have the two jacks in place and lifting the engine-transmission
unit slightly, you really should feel comfortable about removing each and
everyone of the nuts or bolts listed above.  The engine is NOT going to
fall on top of you, I swear.  The two bottom bolts from the engine into
the tranny, as well as the support from the rear engine carrier, are
enough to defeat the laws of gravity.  If you want to be careful, and you
ought to be, do everything except the rear carrier bolts.  Save that for
last and then give the floor jack and the sissor jack an extra lift of
about an inch.  At no time in this operation, have you ever been actually
underneath the engine so that should never be a concern.

At this point, a firm grasp of the fan housing and the lever on the floor
jack is coupled with yanking the whole shebang to the rear.  You'll be
amazed, assuming you've disconnected everything, how easily the engine
will come out (this process is made a thousand times easier if done on
smooth concrete as the little metal wheels on the floor jack hate rough
asphalt as anyone who ever rode a skateboard in the 60s will remember).
Once you've cleared the tranny and the rear carrier support, you'll have
to let the floor jack drop (slowly) so you can pull the engine/jack combo
out under the carrier supports.

What is truly amazing is the fact that the engine with all this crap
balances so well just at the oil sump plate.  It never hurts to keep a
steady hand on the fan housing the entire time until you are out in the
drive.  However, and this is the only real safety concern (other than gas,
sparks, etc), you should know that occasionally the engine will tip to one
side while off the tranny but still inside the engine compartment area
(though now below where it is supposed to be).  This is not a problem and
the engine can be muscled into place again but you want to make sure that
your steadying hand isn't caught between the housing and the top of the
conpartment.

In a moment, your engine will be sitting pretty on top of the floor jack
and a few feet behind the Bus.  That's when you'll need the partner to
bring you the cold beer.

If you need this laid out, I wrote up a step by step guide for my own
purposes to remind me of what exactly I needed to do and what tools were
required for engine R&amp;R and long block swap.  If you need this, just
e-mail.
