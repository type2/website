&gt; &gt;As the proud owner of a ´72 camper, I wouldn't trade her for for
&gt; &gt;anything. But there is one thing that really gets to me -The lack
&gt; &gt;of an overhead engine access that the other year models have.
&gt;
&gt; I don't know how you feel about cutting/welding, but your best bet would
be
&gt; to cut out the section (about 2 inches bigger than the actual opening)
from
&gt; the back of a 73-79 bus, cut out the corresponding part of yours, and have
&gt; the replacement section welded in.
And remember the fuel tank is in that area!!!!!!!!!
