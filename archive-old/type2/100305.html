Subject: NEW YEAR'S Bus Campout

This will be the last message I post before I head out to the campground 
tommorow.  Hope to see you all there :-)


Have you got plans for New Year's?   NO?  Hows about....BUS CAMPING!!! Can 
you imagine a better way to bring in the new year!!

NEW BUS RESOLUTION II: brought to you by the FULL MOON BUS CLUB
DATES:  DEC 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 2002  and JAN 1, 2003
come-n-camp as many nights as you can, even if it's only new years eve

WHERE:  PINE RIDGE CAMPGROUND - Spartanburg, SC
located near Walnut Grove Plantation

LINK TO MAIN SITE:
http://www.fullmoonbusclub_dot_net/nbrc/nbrmain.htm

They do have cabin and cottage rentals in this campground,  so if your too 
warm blooded for cold camping in a bus, then come and rent a cabin. You'll 
be able to sleep in cozy comfort but still mingle with all the buses.  Call 
the campground for info on cabin rentals. The campground phone # is: 
(864)576-0302.


You will NOT need to call and make reservations if your camping in your bus, 
but you can if you like:      They are not very busy at this time of year, 
so we will almost have the entire place to ourselves.



DIRECTIONS TO CAMPGROUND:   Take I-26 away from Spartanburg (towards 
Columbia, SC) and take Exit 28: HWY 221.   Take HWY 221 NORTH, approx. 200 
feet to light, and turn right on &quot;Stillhouse Road&quot;.  Go one mile to Stop 
Sign and take left on &quot;Ott Shoals Road&quot;...go 1.5 miles and see campground 
signs on the left.

to sign-up to bring some fixin's then click this link:

Buddah

PS:   could someone please cross post this to the Vanagon and Vintage Bus 
lists?  THANKS!
