Volks- just to clear it up- the &quot;Mechanic&quot; in question isn't the one who
services my bus. I was just buying a rim off of a bus he had on his lot. 
 I (me and myself, that is) do all of the work on my bus.  Brakes, body,
engine, suspension, tranny, interior, custom modifications- me, me, me,
me, me, me and... oh yeah, ME.  We all gotta be proud of something.
