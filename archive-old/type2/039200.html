&gt; Another Question: Turn signals which flicker at times instead of blinking
regularly. &gt;Bulbs all checked out okay and I cleaned the contacts. Possibly
a relay of some &gt;kind?

Most likely your flasher relay is getting tired.

&gt; I am also looking for a new set of 4 rubber collars- -the ones which
attach the &gt;manifold of my center-mounted Weber 2-barrel, prog. carb to the
four pipes &gt;running down to the heads (induction runners?). Anybody know a
good source for &gt;those?

If you can find them I highly recommend getting urethane collars.  In my
experience they have outlasted rubber by a year or more before cracking.  I
know Fisher Buggies in Tampa, FL has them but that doesn't help you much :)
