Subject: [T2] Wheel Alignment Specs...

Hi Volks,
Does anyone have the specs for aligning the front wheels on a 1971 Westy. My
bus is in the alignment shop and their computer doesn't go back that far. If
anyone could let me know ASAP I would appreciate it very much as I would
like to get this done today. As always, TIA. TBear
