Subject: [T2] Mystery heater

How's it goin' out there?
    I'm re-sending this message because I don't think it got through to
anyone,so here goes.
    I have a '69 type 2 wesfalia that we just drove from British
Columbia,Canada, to Newfoundland on her rebuilt 1600's maiden voyage.
All was pretty smooth except a broken accelerator cable in Ontario and a
bad set of points.
  Anyway I was lucky to find a bone yard with a few busses in St.
John's.( a rare find for sure!)  I looked inside '77 or '78 and found an
electric heater with two 12 volt motors on either side. The whole
assembley runs horizontal underneath the dash itself and is moulded to
fit around the parking brake. It is also made of the same material as
the dash ( steel with that vinyl covering ) and has those same red and
blue control knobs, so I'm almost sure it's some kind of after market VW
component.
    I was wondering if anyone has ever seen one before,and might even
have the diagrams for it? ( I doubt it still works ) This would quite
helpful for the cold fall ahead.
  Thanks from Fester.
