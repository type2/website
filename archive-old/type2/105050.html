Subject: Re: [T2] Inexpensive headlight

&gt; One headlight is a Wagner #M548, and the other is a GE #153.  The GE is the one that isn't working.

The brand does not matter. Any large round h/lamp will work. The Halogen is better than non-Halogen.

Have you swapped yours from side-to-side to verify that the GE is bad?
