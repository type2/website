&gt;Hey all, a few months ago I stumbled across a website that had all the 
&gt;possible gear ratios for various VW transaxles and had rpms listed with 
&gt;tires sizes and conversion charts etc... does anyone know of this site? I 
&gt;need a rev chart for changing the ring and pinion in my tranny.
&gt;Thanks, Sam.

Well I'm always up for plugging my famous gear2000.xls (maybe I need to
update again to gear2001.xls)  but it doesn't have ratios, will tell you
anything
you want once you get the ratios.

Now I didn't put em there cause there was a great www in Germany that
listed all the ratios of every 091 and 091/1 ever made by tranny code in
a nice chart, so I figured why duplicate the effort.  Unfortunately it
disappeared
about a year ago?  Did anyone get a copy?  It was a PDF (another reason
actually copying it would have been a PITA) and I'd love a copy now.
Anyway Bentley has the normal ratios that most US stuff had in them
so that is all you likely need.

gear2000 is free for distribution or modification (anyone want to get smart
and put some power curves in there somehow?)
