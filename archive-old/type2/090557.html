Subject: Re: [T2] FRIDAY CAMPER QUESTION

This is really serious stuff.
I sleep with my head at the hatch end and my screen on in both Winter and
Summer months.
If I get the Westy aimed the right direction I get a very nice breeze
through the whole interior.

Bill M.

If im alone (or with the daschunds) I like 
&gt; it
&gt; better head to the hatch. feels wombier that way. If the wife or one 
&gt; of
&gt; the
&gt; kids is in there with me we sleep the other way becuase it seems 
&gt; roomier
&gt; on the inside end.
