Subject: 2.0L AFM whistle

	The story goes like this. My first rebuild, got the engine to fire
up, exciting. 1981 stock 2.0 F.I.in which I removed the aftermarket cruise
control an AC stuff. This is also my first veedub, enchanted. Asides from
the rough idle and the near overwhelming fear of overheating her, I've
encountered a whistling that, to the best of my knowledge is coming from
the AFM unit itself. I listened to it with the air filter off and on. It
nearly sounds like a type of whistle from a bad seal on some front door
windows. With higher rpm's it seems to go away and at near stall the noise
gets chirpier.
   Could it be the alternator, the blower fan ...?
	Any help would be appreciated.  Thank you, Craig
