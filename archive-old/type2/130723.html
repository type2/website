I'm surprised that no one has asked what platform you use. Most of the 
suggestions have been for windows. On the Mac, there is a fairly simple 
and inexpensive program called PageSpinner. Not WYSIWYG, but more than 
adequate if you don't insist on frames or complicated tables.

Many IPOs limit upload to 5 megs at a time. If you need to upload more 
than that (usually only audio requires more), you'll also want to get a 
copy of Fetch.
