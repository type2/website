Subject: Please LOOK, and tell me what you think.

 OK, you guys are starting to worry me now... Please go to www.thesamba_dot_com.
Find the 66 dual port camper-style bus posted on Jan.14th from Jerome, Idaho
 and tell me what you think...

Thumbs up... or thumbs down.
I'm planning on getting it today if the money comes in...
But, if it has rust in places that will be hard to fix, I need to know.

Tell me what you think , and get back to me asap...
Thanks...
Karen*
