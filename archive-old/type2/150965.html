Subject: Re: [T2] Rear axle bearings needed?

These are the new ones from BD. Manufactured by Empi I believe. Come with CV
joints installed dry, had to pack them myself with the grease that came with
them. Still hanging on to my original axles just in case the new ones turn out
to be junk.

  Hey Tom   New or reman??   big difference   I have seen a bunch of reman
axles go south very quick     Also if they are off it wont hurt to make sure
that there is plenty of grease  later  Mark Dearing
