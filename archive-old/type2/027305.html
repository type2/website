Since we seem to be discussing tires/wheels........

The PO put tires on the front that have very short sidewalls, which I don't 
understand or like and hope to rectify soon. So I've been looking for as 
much tire info as I can find. I'm confused, though. He's got 14 inch tires 
on the bus but I went out to measure the rims and they look like 15 inch to 
me! Am I just measuring wrong or what? Or is there some trick to wheel 
dimensions?

TIA

Need we ask anyone to tell us these things?
