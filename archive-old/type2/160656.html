Subject: Re: [T2] Still looking for a Bodyshop in Maryland

I was searching the archives for body shops in Maryland when I came across
this posting

&quot;Hello,
I am new to the list and am hoping someone here can help me. I just was
given a 1977 camper, all I want is for it to be is solid running and rust
free. &quot;

Meg, I think that's what we ALL want in our VW's, and perhaps respect and
honesty in our relationships!!!

On topic:  I think contact Les Prosser   prosser_at_bellatlantic_dot_net
would have a handle on Annapolis, and Pat Flynn of course
