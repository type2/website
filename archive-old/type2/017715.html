What's the story?

PO said he got a 'new' engine installed in his '77
bus.  The fan shroud is coded GD (correct, I
believe), but the case is stamped EC02738.

Muir said EC = Type III

Is this a Type III case, and can a Type III case
live happily within a '77 bus?

Is it possioble/probable that the engine has
hydraulic lifers?

Does the EC case do anything re: horsepower
increase/decrease?

Is this EC case worth saving??

Should I track down the shop which gave the PO
this EC case, and complain!!

Thanks for your responses
