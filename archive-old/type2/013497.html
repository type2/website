&gt; My motor has 6.9:1 compression, will I get by okay at high altitudes or
&gt; will we have problems? 

Higher altitude effectively lowers compression ratio, due to the thinner
air. I don't know the equation to figure out the exact ratio. So at
altitude your 6.9:1 compression ratio will go down. IMHO 6.9 is a little
high for a stock type bus motor so it should do great at higher altitude,
and run cooler. Once you get much over 5,000 feet you'll probably notice
some power loss but you'll just have to go slower over those big mountain
passes. Be careful not to overrev the motor in a low gear. Thats how the
PO of my bus grenaded the motor driving over the continental divide. 

Happy motoring
