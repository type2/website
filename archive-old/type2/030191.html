&gt; &gt; &gt; they would fit. The idea was to let the alternator and
&gt; &gt; &gt; cooling fan spin a little faster.
&gt; 
&gt; It might be that spinning the fan faster won't flow more air.  If the flow
&gt; is already &quot;choked&quot; with the stock fan pulley spinning it faster won't
&gt; make any difference.  If you have a way to measure air flow it would be
&gt; easy to determine by plotting air flow versus engine RPM.  If the curve
&gt; still has positive slope at 5000 engine RPM then spinning the fan faster
&gt; would be effective, but if the curve flattens out it would just cause
&gt; problems.

Along these lines. My gen belts typically ride pretty far up in the hub.
I suppose a smaller fan belt would have the same effect as a smaller
pulley.
I think I always use the conti 905 but I see ron has 900mm as well.
thoughts?
