&gt;Just a quick note on this:  The engine mentioned in the original post is a
&gt;2.0.  These carbs that Ron mentions were designed for a 1.7 and they just
&gt;don't breathe enough for a 2.0 motor (ask David Schwarze).

Yes, but they make great torque down low and provide decent fuel
efficiency.  Guess it depends on one's tastes - you can definately make
more top end power with bigger carbs.  Also, these same carbs were
available in Europe on the 2-liter engines for many years.
