Subject: Re: [T2] help with an 82 camper

Ian,

They didn't offer a turbo diesel to my knowledge.  Is
this engine an aftermarket installation?  VW had an
eco-diesel with mild turbo action around 1990, but I
don't think that engine had a lot more power than the
stock one.

There are those ewho think a diesel in a heavy camper
can only go 120K miles, so one question would be how
many miles is on it?  By the way, there are also
diesel lovers who say that at 100K miles they're just
getting broken in.  Which VW engine is it, so you can
check the reliability of that year?  There is a diesel
expert in Pa on this list that put a turbo in his
camper, but I wasn't aware he was selling his.
