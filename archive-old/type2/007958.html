	Folks,
	Short form: 
	I backed our bus out of the drive way and it died. Plenty
of gas smell, points open and shut, wires on tight as far as I can
tell. What's wrong? Don't know, can't fix it, have AAA tow it to
the local VW dealer (Broadway VW, Oakland) since a) it can't be
very hard, it was working fine b) they say they still work on
aircooled c) I don't know any independant shops up here.

	IN THE END IT WAS ACTUALLY FIXED by (and I recomend) 
Bauer German Repair on University Avenue in Berkeley.

	TURNED OUT it was an ignition wiring problem- condensor
wire or some other minor wire that wasn't in my prior-problem
list and therefore I didn't check. Shame on me. I've got to have
a brief conversation with the mechanic (who's first language is NOT
English) tomorrow to find out exactly what was wrong.

	Long form:
	William Of Occam 1, William of Oakland -$400.

	Broadway VW couldn't figure it out, thought the carb was
flooding, suggested I needed a new carb since they don't recognize
31PICT as a stock item. $600 estimate to fix it. :(
	I said no way, check over the electricals and if your
theory is right, confirm it by pinching-off or disconnecting
and plugging the pump-to-carb hose. They said, &quot;Fouled plugs, bad timing,&quot;
and in a moment of weakness I let them do plugs/points/condensor/cap/rotor,
well heck, it never hurts to get that out of the way. They did 'em,
and said that they leaned it way out and got it to run. Come pick it up.
Nearly $300, bill, $40 for parts, the rest labor.

	So I picked it up last week and it ran BAD, stuttering, backfiring
(thinks- ok, too rich to burn, goes off in exhaust pipe?? I'm still not
clear on the mechanics of backfiring or in this case almost certainly
POST cylinder combustion... expert opinions anyone? Bentley says its
a symptom of too lean, which surprises me) weak, touchy, nothing like
the completely trouble-free 8K miles we've had since it first came
to life, with the exception of that points problem... So I got 1.8 miles
or so from the dealership, about half-way home, on a steep hill, and it
lets loose with a couple of REALLY loud ka-bangs and dies utterly. Can't
be started. This is Wednesday, day before Thanksgiving, about 4:40pm.

	Well now I'm believing their story, I figure the carb float
or float valve has failed, so I stew all through Thanksgiving because
I don't have time to work on it... I feel SOooooooo sorry for myself,
family life and raising a 22 month old just don't seem to leave any
time for diddling around with the truck. I sure wish I could take time
to rebuild the carb, then it would run fine...

	Tuesday I call AAA for another tow, they say sure, be there in an
hour and a half. Ouch. So I go clean up the office at home, sort stuff,
be useful. Hour and a half passes, nothing. Let another hour go by, nothing.
I call again, person I get says their supervisor is talking to the tow
truck driver, he's at the truck (1.2 miles down the hill from where I am
at home) and looking for me... so I say, tell him to stay there, I'm coming
I'll be there in 3 minutes. Leap out the front door, shoot down the
street at 25mph, get to the truck, nobody's waiting. Wait half an hour, 
nobody shows up. Now I'm steamed. And our son was napping but woke and I've
screwed up his sleep schedule, so I daren't go home, I go up to a coffee
shop and call. Long call. They're nice, they're sorry, someone will be
there in 1/2 hour. At the truck. I go back. I wait an hour. Its now 2:45pm
and I started at 9:35. I haven't YET seen anyone from AAA. I go back up to
town, call again, ask for a supervisor and give her a piece of my mind.
I go to work. Later I find that the tow-truck guy showed up at my house
minutes after I left, and didn't appear to get the message that I'd gone
down to where the truck was. The second miss they apparently just didn't
even try to send a truck- the telephone person said go but didn't do anything
that would produce results. :P

	That night I call again about 9:15, they say sure, be right out, see
you at your truck in 1/2 hour. I go, they show up in 1/2 hour, we tow
the truck to Bauer. Next morning I drive out, meet Mr. Bauer as he's
opening up the shop, I tell him to check the carb, tell him what's
been done, say do what you like up to $200, call me if its more.

	He calls in the afternoon and leaves a message saying it works. I
bike down there this morning and pay the bill $108.xx, $80 for check over,
fix the wire problem, set timing and $20 to tightenup the fan belt. While
he's at it Mr. Bauer recommends a Pertronix system in place of points,
should I be so inclined in the future. He says the engine runs strong. 
That's a very hopeful sign. He starts it and it DOES run strong, very
nice, I drive home round-about ways its just fine. Back to status quo ante.
$400 lighter.

	SO: Bills three rules of aircooled car repair are still 
Electrical, Electrical, Electrical. Except for it might be cam followers.

	I didn't exactly follow what Bauer said was the problem, given
some time to think it over, so I'm going to call him tomorrow and hope he
remembers exactly which wire was shorted to what. Then I'm going to 
contact Broadway VW and tell them 
a) what the actual problem was, 
b) how poor I consider their diagnostic process, 
and ask them 
c) if they think it makes sense for them to skin me for $240 in labor, 
work on the area the problem was in and not actually get the engine to work.

	I expect no satisfaction but I'll have done the right thing
and perhaps this experience will benefit the next rube that walks in
their door. Its a pity, their parts department seem nice, they're 3 miles
from my house and the only dealer in town.

	I'm left with a minor mystery. I've got a 31PICT&lt;nothing&gt; on
the engine, which was installed by the builder, ECI in Corona, CA. Works
fine. Book says 30PICT-3 for a '70, with throttle positioner. RMMW catalog
list 31PICT as the universal 30PICT replacement, and lists 30PICT2/3
rebuild kits. Do the 30PICT rebuild kits work for 31PICTs? There is SOME
difference between a 30PICT2 and a 30PICT3, is there any difference
between a 31PICT and 31PICT3? My VW parts book says the 31PICT3 had one
legit bus application, on 1300cc busses for Italy!

	Happy motoring and thanks for all the support!

	Bill
