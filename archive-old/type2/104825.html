Subject: Low vacuum in rebuilt engine

At the risk of sounding like yet another &quot;bash the vendor&quot; post....

Some here may remember that I was trying to put a rebuilt engine
(2.0L) from AVP into my '82 Westy late last year.

Well, it finally passed smog this week.

There have been several problems with the engine:

1. The distributor gear shaft was put in in such a way that the
distributor could not be properly rotated to fire at the right time :
the cold start valve got in the way of the vacuum advance unit. After
about a month of trying to get the engine to fire up, I had it towed
to Bugformance (the one in San Jose) and they pulled the distributor
gear shaft and rotated it clockwise so that the vac advance would
clear the cold start valve.

2. The second problem was in passing smog. Idle emissions were high.
This was attributed to a low vacuum (8&quot;) which resulted from (if the
folks at Bugformance are to be believed) valves which were not closing
right. Their solution was to tighten the rockers against the pushrods.
I had not tried it yet, but apparently the engine is now almost too
tight to turn by hand....

3. The whole thing is still not 100% satisfactory since I still have
trouble starting it (have to step on the gas pedal slightly when
turning the key). I also have trouble idling it when it is cold : the
speed will go up and down until the engine dies. Tomorrow, I'll bypass
the idle stabilizer unit and see it that still happens.

Has anyone else had similar problems with rebuilt 2.0 engines? I was
told that rebuilt hydraulic lifters have been problem areas.

I really want to get this thing on the road. Camping season is here
soon and the kids are excited about sleep in the Westy.

Thanks.
