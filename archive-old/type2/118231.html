Subject: Berg oil line fittings leak

I installed my first Berg full flow kit on a new 1776 and the first 
run on a test stand caused oil leaks in most of the fittings.

I would like to re-do these using a sealant.  Berg forbids me to use 
teflon tape  -  my first choice  -  and recommends green Loctite. 
This product seems to me to be more of a thread-locker than a sealant.

My previous experience with this Loctite has been on case studs and 
I've been properly impressed by how difficult it is to break loose a 
Loctite thread.

All in all, I want to avoid this Loctite.

Can anyone suggest a sealant for these full flow oil fittings.

Jack
