Subject: Re: [T2] sherlock freakin' holmes (was hit &amp; run)

Cruise the parking lots at local bars, shopping centers, grocery stores
looking for damage that could indicate that a car hit you. There could be
some paint scrapes that you could match.
Then you can then call the police and they will tell you that all you can
do is confront the vehicle owner on your own since there are no
witnesses. If you find the person you can sue and possibly get a
judgement for damages. Remember............. you'll have to renew
(re-record) your judgement every seven years.
