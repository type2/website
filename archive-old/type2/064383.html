Subject: 412 engine in a bus??

        I've been trying to help this guy with his new bus.  He says
that when he bought the bus they told him it was a 73 but all thing
point to a 72 (VIN and door jamb sticker, he has not got a chance to
relook at the turn signals).  He also says that the engine number is EA
100905, which seems puzzling.  From what I can figure out this is a 74
engine from a type 4 vehicle (412 station wagon) with 80 hp and 1700cc.  Now can this be right
are they the same kind of engines as the bus pancake and if not what
modifications would have been done to it?? It has a single carb on it
now, did it originally come with FI.

Thanks Tim
