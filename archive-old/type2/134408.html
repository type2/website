Subject: Type 4 engine crankfhaft needed

I've got a Vanagon CV Engine Type IV crankshaft, Price $60.00

Crank comes with can drive gear and distributor druve gear. It will need to
be polished but should make a STD crank.
Also got a full set of 94mm cylinders and pistons $45.00
All of these items are used but in good condition.
Ship from Dallas TX 75220
I can quote freight if you give me a shipping address.
