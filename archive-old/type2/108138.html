&gt; A single-wire sensor will have to be mounted in the heater box in order
&gt; to ensure it gets heated to the correct temperature, but a more
&gt; expensive heated sensor can be mounted in the tailpipe if you prefer
&gt; not to drill the heater box pipe.

The best place to mount the O2 sensor is the &quot;earliest&quot; point in the exhaust
system where the O2 sensor can &quot;see&quot; the combined exhaust of the two heads.
In any case, it certainly should go *in front* of any catalytic converter so
that it's acting on the &quot;unmodified&quot; exhaust.

&gt; &gt; I have a 83 aircooled Vanagon california emissions.
&gt; &gt; there is a sensor that connects to my wiring harness
&gt; &gt; that is literally screwed into the exhaust system just
&gt; &gt; before the catalytic converter.  I am transfering my
&gt; &gt; emissions over to an earlier no CA model exhaust - do
&gt; &gt; I need the exhaust sensor to be connected to run
&gt; &gt; right? if so, i will have to drill in a hole in my
&gt; &gt; exhaust pipe.
