&gt; Has anyone seen a successful power steering upgrade to
&gt; a Type-2 of any year prior to '79?  Power Steering was
&gt; not an option for these models.  And the Power
&gt; Steering fitted Vanagons have a re-designed front-end,
&gt; making a VW retro-fit to a '78 frame difficult.

there are electric boosters used by disabled folks in their power steering
but they are VERY expensive...check an adaptive auto service look under
&quot;Hand Controls&quot; in the auto section of your yellow pages
