&gt;Which part on the microfiche is it that is ripped from the nozzle?

#1 which is 211-201-119.

I can't speak for all gas stations but I haven't seen the original fuel neck tear because of repeated contact with the nozzle. The &quot;bird beak&quot; (211-201-119A) fuel neck for California models did but it was way more complicated in shape.

FYI. It's also possible for fuel to come out of the breather lines on top when the tank is full and the turns are sharp because those fuel hoses can crack.
