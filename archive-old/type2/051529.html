Subject: Re: [T2] Double Cab Questions

Hiya Scott,

Binz was an aftermarket conversion to a doublecab before VW went into the 
business for themselves in 58(?).  In any event, Binz was a German outfit so 
finding one of those here in the States would be &quot;nice&quot;.
As for DCs around here.............  I've noticed one (a 71) at the 
Springmeet and OctoBugFest in Puyallup for the past couple of years.  I 
haven't paid any attention to it other than to notice its presence, but it 
has been for sale.  Nice looking unit with the canvas intact.
There are a few running around down here in the Portland area, but I have not 
seen one for sale in a month or two.  If you'd like, I can scan the ads down 
here and let you know if anything's happening.

Mike
