Subject: Re: split conversion?

Tony,  and list,
    You asked...&quot;he is seriously considering taking the body from the
split and putting it on a 72-79 under-carraige. Now he's a Navy
trained welder with equipment...So I assume he could do the actual
work, but...Has anyone actually done this before?&quot;

Well, the answer is yes and no.  Here on Long Island there is a fella
that took the body off his splittie and put it on the chassis of a
Toyota van.  There's a picture of it someplace in the gallery at the
Samba site, but I don't have the time to look for it now.  With your
friends skills and a little creativity I bet it could be done.
