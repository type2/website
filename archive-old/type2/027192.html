_____________________________________________________________
I have found that the operator of my bus (me) tends to have higher blood 
temperatures and pressures when operating the bus in the company of other 
vehicles: people who get p*ssed off when I don't go 0 to 50 in 4 seconds 
when the light turns green, and who so indicate by passing me on the 
right in a burst of speed. 
So what do other type2 operators do to keep their blood temps and 
pressures down in traffic? Any tips will be appreciated.
_______________________________________________________________
&lt;&lt;I have found it dont matter how fast I go,,,everyone expects to pass me.
I just stay to the right an putt on down the road. I turn up the tunes
and think of all of the good people I get to meet at the V-Dubb meets and
all of the peace signs I have seen &quot;flipped&quot; my way an it makes up
for all off the idiots who are always late. I am never late,,,,just on
time.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

BTW...watch that blood pressure!

                   Peace,

Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me;
Other times I can barely see.
Lately it occurs to me. What a long strange trip it's been!
