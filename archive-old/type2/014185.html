Subject: New to list.

Hi all, I am new to the list and thought I should make myself known. My name is Paul Shurvell, and I live in Darwin in the Northern Territory, Australia. I am currently in the process of buying my first T2 bus, a 1974 camper. This will be my first aircooled VW (I have owned a '79 Golf GLD in the past), The bus is in Brisbane, and I fly out on Monday to go and pick it up. What I would like to know is what sort of spares should I carry for the trip (3500km, what is likely to go wrong, and what I should check before I leave? The engine has been rebuilt within the last 2 years by a prominent Brisbane WV mechanic so it should be ok, however, I can't say as much for the rest of it. Another thing I would like to know is how do I tell what capacity the engine is just by looking at it (is it stamped somewhere?). I know that this is prety basic stuff and has probably been covered on the list a hundred times, but as I am new to this I hope you will all induge me!
Regards to all, Paul Shurvell.
