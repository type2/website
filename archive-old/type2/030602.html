Andrew, and all, 

I disagree.  Let me explain why.  If you have had a leak in a wheel
cylinder, then you hve gotten brake fluid on the pads/shoes.  Almost
invariably. If you have gotten brake fluid on the shoes, you *must*
replace them.  All claims by Brakleen and others aside, I have never
gotten a set of contaminated brake shoes clean enough to be comfortable
driving on them.  Since you would never (I hope) consider replacing the
shoes on only one side of an axle, you will be putting a new cylinder and
new shoes on one side, new shoes and a used cylinder on the other.  *IN
THEORY* I have no problem with this, but...  Given that the one cylinder
let go, can the other be far behind?  And then you will be replcing both
of the shoes again, and the other wheel cylinder.

With one exception, whenever I have to work on one bit of a brake set, I
treat the whole axle as &quot;known bad&quot;.  That is, I replace all pads/shoes,
all hardware (springs), both flex lines.  The only variant is that, while
I will replace both wheel cylinders on drum brakes, I will not replace
both calipers on discs, unless one is bad.  My rationale on this is that
calipers last much longer than the pads, whereas wheel cylinders do not
seem to.  I wear out multiple disc pads before the calipers blow on me,
but usually cheaping out on the drums means getting another set of shoes
shortly after replacing them :-( I will also only replace metal lines if
they fail a visual inspection (that is, are pretty rusty or kinked). 
Lastly, all used parts go straight to the trash or (again, calipers) back
as cores.  I don't save anything as a spare, they are just too cheap
compared to my life.

Brakes are one of the few areas where I am semi-fanatic.  A bad engine
won't kill you, bad brakes can.

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
