&gt; any thoughts?

Missy, list:
Actually lubrication of the rear U-shaped sliding door hinge  is covered in
the owner's manual. In fact there are only 2 lubrication items mentioned in
the 78 manual in front of me, the other one being the front axle beams five
grease zerks.
(Upon reading the text, the item under the sliding door picture says also to
oil  the rear lid hinges.) Interval for both is 6 months with a few drops of
SAE 30 engine oil.
It's my experience that by the time I've noticed the sliding door hinge is
troublesome, it's WAY past time that a few drops of oil will help. usually I
have to take the cover and door off and heat it up and work it apart. I give
it a  thorough cleaning of the rust and reassembly with waterproof white
grease or motorcycle chain lube. This is also a good time to replace the
white plastic guide piece, and clean and lube the roller wheel on the bottom
of the door.
A word about that little roller wheel: Take good care of it! Last I checked
they were $45 at the dealer, nobody else had them. They will rust out and
fall off if there is any water getting into the front of the channel. When
the wheel falls off, then the door falls off every time you try to open it,
and your quality of life with your bus goes down substantially!
