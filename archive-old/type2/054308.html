Subject: rear main seal question

I didn't see anything in the archive files with alot of info on installing a 
new rear seal.  I recently found out the place I had work on Consuela didn't 
replace the seal, as requested, but put gasket sealer around it...:((.  I 
didn't need a pulley to get the center bolt out.  Is there anything special I 
need to know before putting her back together.

To everyone who replied to my previous request for a VW mechanic in this 
area, I'm slowly getting the energy to work on her again myself.  Thanks for 
all the offers and wish me luck!!!
