&gt;2. Broke down last month, replaced points (fried) and plugs (black) -- 
&gt;everything else looked good. Plugs were black due to old carb problems -- 
&gt;didn't replace plugs w/new carb install.

Did you replace the condenser at the same time as the points?  With a Bosch 
one?  Like Muir says,
&quot;points and condenser go together like bread and butter.&quot;

I personally, would not use ANY ignition parts other than Bosch.  I have 
had nothing but trouble when
I have done so.  I would begin with replacing that non-Bosch 
coil....................
