Subject: Re: [T2] Spark plugs for 1977 Bay

&gt;   I am the original owner of a 1977 sunroof bus; original FI 2.0L engine
&gt; (rebuilt once to stock condition).  I am confused about which is the best
&gt; sparkplug.  The Library article by Jim Thompson tells about the different
&gt; driving conditions to use a Bosch W7 versus a W8, and I also see there is both
&gt; a W8CC and a W8CC0.  The article is also a little confusing in this regard:
&gt; Jim says the W8 is hotter running, but then under W7 besides saying it is a
&gt; colder plug, he says: &quot;Usually the plug of choice when building those hi-perf
&gt; motors as well because they tend to run a little hotter than stock.&quot; (Emphasis
&gt; added.)  I thought he just said they were colder!

If your motor has a tendency to run hot, one way to counteract this is to
use a cooler rated plug. For example a high performance engine may run
hotter due to performance modifications, making the cooler plug a beneficial
choice. 

As an overly simplified general rule, you would run the cooler plug in
hotter conditions, and vice versa. So the W7CC would be your summer plug,
since it the cooler plug, and the W8CC would be your winter plug.

I think some other members have mentioned NGK as plugs of choice and I
agree. I have used the NGK BPR5ES, and the BP7ES and they are both good. The
BPR5ES is the plug that NGK recommends for a type IV powered bus, and the 7
is a cooler plug. The NGK numbers for temperature of plugs run opposite
those of Bosch, just to add to the confusion. The R means resistor, so the
second plug number is a non-resistor type.

There is certainly no danger at all in running any of these plugs, NGK or
Bosch, and the the W8CC that many people use is the standard plug, so you
may find W8CC works better than the W7CC especially in the cooler months.
&gt; 
&gt;   So, which plug will make me happier:  W7CC, W8CC or W8CC0?  And what's the
&gt; difference between W8CC and W8CC0??

I am waiting for someone to answer that one, too.
