&amp;gt; Anybody been to Cheyenne, WY? It's a 2 hour trip from here and I was
&amp;gt; thinking about a mini vacation. Super 8 has a $50/night rate this week. Get
&amp;gt; the wife and kids out of the house for a couple days.

Been there.  Cheyenne isn't exactly the scenic part of the state.  Still,
fun is where you find it!  Perhaps you will find some interesting blue
roads to follow...

You can probably beat the Super 8 price and get better accommodations if
you check out some of the privately-owned motels.  Just stay away from the
railroad tracks, which is often difficult in Wyoming!
