Subject: push start

just goes to show if you don't know something isn't supposed to work you try anyway :-)
2 years ago there was plenty of battery so those occasions everything worked it just 
didn't start.
on my dead battery ones there was minimal juice just not nearly enough to start the 
bus. so now i need to either rewire my radio so i don't need to turn everything on to 
run it or listen to some other source.

doesn't any fuel remain in the system when the bus is turned off???
&gt; 
&gt; On an FI engine, the fuel pump has to be running in order to supply fuel 
&gt; pressure for the injectors.  But if you're push-starting, the key is not 
&gt; in the &quot;start&quot; position and so the fuel pump relay isn't going to be 
&gt; closed (plus your battery is dead anyway), so the pump isn't going to be 
&gt; running.  Also, the ECU isn't going to have juice of your battery is dead.
&gt; need the ECU to be powered up, either :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Now, maybe if your battery is not totally flat, there's enough juice to 
&gt; power up the ECU... and maybe also enough to run the pump once the 
&gt; engine starts sucking air (which will open up the AFM and cause the pump 
&gt; to start running).
