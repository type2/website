Subject: Some oddities...

Ok listers, I beg to touch on the collective braintrust on a couple of
questions...

1. - Started noticing that I seemed to be leaking brake fluid a few weeks
ago, but the problem seemed to be intermittent. Having been out of town on
my (usually) days off, I haven't had a chance to pop things off and take a
look. But about a week ago, after having stopped off to have a burger, I
noticed a puddle under the left front tire. Amber liquid, brake fluid, that
is.

The next day, however, no spongy brake, firm pressure, no leaking. Seemed
very odd. This back and forth, leaking/no leak went on for a few days, when
I realized that the leaking got worse as the temperature dropped. On the
milder days, no problems. Gets below 35 degrees, I might as well be pouring
fluid out of the bottle into the street.

So, my theory is that the wheel cylinder(s) have worn just to the point that
low temps cause the fluid to blow by, while higher temps tighten things up.
Would explain why the problem never surfaced until recently. Any other
ideas? I have ordered new wheel cylinders, just in case.

2. - OK, I've looked through Bentley, Haynes, and Muir, and found no record
of this thing. It's a small push/pull rod on the front side of the driver's
side seat pedestal up front. It does not seem to be attached to anything
(I've looked under the pedestal) but I'm sure it's *supposed* to have a
purpose. Have I gone blind, or is it not referenced anywhere? What is this
thing? Heating control? If so, what is it supposed to be connected to? What
else? Help.

On a side note - thanks to all who have already responded with the updates
on the BusTour drives. I should have most of the updates that I've received
to date on the website tonight.
