John, I agree that the German lines seem to not last as long, but I thought I'd chime in that our lines are metric in size (forget the dimensions), and although the SAE lines are close and hold when you clamp 'em, they will eventually leak at the clamps. So...make sure you get the right size too!

Thanks! Joe

&gt;I went to the FLAPS and got standard fuel
&gt;line and clamps for all connections. I feel much better with this setup.
&gt;If your fuel lines are old, replace them. If you don't know how old they
&gt;are, replace them. The parts are cheap and if the old lines fail it could
&gt;be a real disaster.
&gt;I am sorry to preach at all of you but I feel that I have now done my duty.
