Subject: Re: Clutch?: 74 Bus

Hi Pete,
  A decisive moment in any man's life: Pulling your first engine...But
seriously: I did the same thing when I bought my first bus (73 bus).
Considering the effort involved in pulling the engine, I would replace
everything but the kitchen sink inside the bellhousing: Clutch, pressure
plate, throwout bearing, engine front oil seal and pilot shaft bearing. Get
the kit from RMMW, it has all these parts and they
carry the top quality german SACHS clutches. Also get a new flywheel o-ring
(not oncluded in the kit and almost always worn out...). Getting the old
pilot shaft bearing out can be a pane, I eventually got a small bearing
puller to do the job. And of course, while the engine is out you'll find a
couple or tenthousand things to do that are a pain to do with the engine in
place....Enjoy your adventure...

             &gt; Hello all.  I have been lurking
on this list for over two months now; &gt; I think it's time to air my problem.
&gt;
&gt; In my '74 bus (my first VW!), my clutch periodically works.  On those
&gt; times that it does work, driving it for more than 20 seconds is ample
&gt; enough time for the bus to decide that the clutch must not work.
&gt; Needless to say, driving it is now an inconvenience.  I recently
&gt; replaced the clutch cable (thinking this might solve the problem).
&gt;
&gt; According to Muir, any sort of problem with shifting and/or clutch
&gt; slippage is indicative of a problem with the clutch itself.  He also
&gt; states that a high pitched whine when shifting into first could mean a
&gt; lack of grease on the flywheel.  On occasion, simply by pushing the
&gt; clutch in, I can hear such a noise.
&gt;
&gt; I have decided to attempt pulling the engine (I've ordered a Bentley
&gt; manual as well as Wilson's &quot;How to rebuild. . .&quot; to accompany my
&gt; Muir).
&gt;
&gt; The question is this: Is there any way that this problem could be a
&gt; faulty/tired transmission?  If I successfully get the engine out, will
&gt; a clutch problem be obvious?  Any help will be appreciated.  Thanks.
&gt; PETE
&gt;
&gt;
