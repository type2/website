Volks,

Bill and I discussed this a bit earlier in the weekend.  The part he needs
is (not) visible in this picture:

The missing linkage *should* be the same for all air cooled FI buses.
When I have serviced the EGR valve unit, I have always had to remove the
valve and the nut on top of the butterbly shaft of the throttle body.  It
has been a while and i forget exactly why, but I think the ends do not
come out of either end peacefully.

Please give Bill a hand if you have one of these pups in your parts stash!
