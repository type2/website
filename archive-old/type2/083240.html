Subject: EveryBus Blues :(

I know how you feel.  Wanted to go to Everybus this
year, the bus is ready to go, but alas, I have to work
today until 7AM Sunday (long shifts at the fire
station I work at).  Even thought about calling in
&quot;sick&quot;, but cant do that anymore as I am the
supervisor now.

The sky might be gray, but at least you have some time
to spend sleeping out tonight.  I would be happy to be
just doing that

Make your smile be your umbrella,

Chuck
