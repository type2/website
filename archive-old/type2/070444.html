&gt;so, did you see the beetle go 150 MPH, or did it just sit there?  and did you
&gt;see it start to lift off the ground?

I remember hearing this in high school.  It could be urban legend (high school
was a looooong time ago, so the word legend seems very appropriate), but the
story is reasonable.  

Ground effects are what keep bugs from flying.  You would have to have air
flowing under the car (to create a higher pressure area than the pressure
above the car, thus lift) rather than around it (which creates a low pressure
area under the car, balancing out the low pressure area above the car).

I have heard that the ground effects can be broken by hitting a bump, catching
some air, and then the lift takes over.  However, since this &quot;wing&quot; is so
short from side to side and has no stability, the now-flying bug tips over
(probably to the left because of the weight of the driver), and depending on
how high it has flown, lands on its side or roof.....
