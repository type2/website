Eastwood has beat the rotisserie with this thing! It tilts your car on its side!

13. Q. Does The Vehicle Tilter need to be permanently installed and how bulky    is it?

I can only imagine how many of these they would sell if the answer was YES! 

Imaging driving down the street with that thing attached - &quot;No office I swear, it is NOT a mobile jungle jim for my kids... but the view from the top is fantastic!&quot;
