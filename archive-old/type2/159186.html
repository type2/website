&gt;wish I could go to Europe and get
&gt;one of the diesel vans with sliding doors on both sides and 4 wheel drive!
&gt;
&gt;

I have been driving a 5-cylinder Eurovan (1993) for 3 weeks now while my 
Cabrio is out of the game. I would not want one for a daily  driver b/c 
I'm just a small car kind of guy ((Cabrio rmember?) but nice van even 
with 174K commericial delivery miles on it!

I saw a Swedish brochure the other day for te Eurovan and they claim 30+ 
mpg with the diesel engine. AM ANXIOUS to own a diesel in our next car. 
I understand the $100K price tag to certify a new engine and understand 
that American consumers don't &quot;get it&quot; or don't care until gas is $4.50 
a gallon so low diesel sales.

My version: a turbo diesel Weekender with 4WD. No, skip the 4WD b/c I'm 
not going to take a vehcile like that into the wilds and boonies. If the 
FWD won't do it I ain't going. &lt;grin!&gt; Keep it in the garage until a 
trip or weekend jaunt into the boonies. Drive small, economical cars 
during the week. Basically the 2 city cars + something nice in the 
garage plan that we like.

Parked next to a domestic minivan the other day. The Eurovan is like a 
moving van compared to the minivans sold by Ford and Daimler and takes 
up no more parking space. It's those tall flat sides that we all love. 
The other minivans taper greatly at the top and that requires the 
designers to move the seating towards the middle so there is good head 
room, and that leads to thick wall panels to fill the space.  Thus the 
typical domestic big on the outside and small on the inside effect. It 
might LOOK substantial but no better than our VW's with less bulky 
interior panels.

'93 Eurovan 2.5L 5-banger (temp loaner)
'97 Cabrio (on jackstands for the want of $4 in axle seals and time to 
fix it)
'99 CR-V AWD - just flawless for 126K miles.
'65 Beetle patiently waiting (in the dry) for some attention
