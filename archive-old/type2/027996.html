Harry, the &quot;certs&quot; are intended. They will be in your rebuild kit. You didn't need to remove them to split the case.

I've just recently split my first GD ('77 2.0) case and I found it had many more case parting bolts and nuts than the earlier style cases. Keep looking carefully under the gook and gunk. Try next to the # 3 cylinder in the back; there's one very well-hidden nut in there. Once you get all the fasteners, the case will split just about as easily as the Type 1 engine.

Have fun! Joe
