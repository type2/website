Subject: '78 Baywindow cowl vent flappers question - part needed

I'm working on my bus this weekend and discovered I need a part. I had this 
part but don't know where it would be these days.

I am looking for that little nylon coupler that attaches the two flappers 
inside the cowl vent.

I may know where I can get one locally but what years are interchangeable?
