Subject: Re: [T2] VW Trademarks

To my way of seeing things, the VW is a vehicle for the tinkerer and the
&quot;hands-on&quot;, proactive owner. If you keep the valves adjusted and do all the
other maintenance such as frequent checking of oil, and oil changes and
lubes, brake adjustments, etc... You will be a happy camper. It's the people
who don't want to take the time and who want to ignore little warnings and
let them go who end up disappointed. The VWs cannot take the kind of neglect
that American cars can. They can give a lot of performance and have a long
life, but only if they are maintained faithfully.  Jan B
