Subject: RE: tires

Just a quick note on tires: When looking for tires I called Continental's
800#
and talked to an application rep. He told me they make a tire that is
specifically
designed for the Volkswagen Type II, and this vehicle only. I forget the
number
C20 or something. 
It was the same price as the reinforced Michelins I bought. Just was going
to take two weeks
to get, and the belts were hanging out of my old tires.

76 Type II.IV.VII which is all tucked in for the winter.
