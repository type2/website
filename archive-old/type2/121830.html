Subject: Workshop Equipment for Local Manufacture

I am looking for one of these VW only publications covering 1968-1979
buses. Found one on thesamba_dot_com but it was copyrighted in the late
1950's. If you have one you don't want to part with, would you consider
making copies of the tols I need. My father is a retired tool and die
maker with his own shop, maybe he can fabricate these things. It's
frustrating when the manual says &quot; now use VW tool # ------, and I don't
have it. manythanks  Tim
