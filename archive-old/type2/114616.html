&lt;&lt; I don't think I'd chop up my 73 to but a new Bus body on it. But I'm sure I

could go to Mexico and bring back a 2001 Bus for like $1,000 bucks or less,

put it in the garage, then buy a 1970 Bus from the junkyard (there's like 4

of them) try to get the original title, and swap all the identification

stuff I can from the old Bus, to the new Bus.

 &gt;&gt;

First off, this is a federal offense with the same fine and maybe a little
time for a Bus or a Porsche...This is in addition to the various fines for
a vehicle that doesn't have the DOT, NHTSA, or EPA certification...
I'd also tend to think that if you have a serious accident with the neo-
vinned Bus, and it comes under inspection by an insurance adjuster,
the insurance won't cover you...IIRC, most insurance policies don't
cover the vehicle while in the commission of a crime...
