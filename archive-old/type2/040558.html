Hi Joel,

We contacted this guy several times and he said he didn't have a kit with
instructions to send out. He said he hadn't done many too if I remember
right. He also said that he would look into prices for parts, etc and get
back to us but we haven't heard anything. Does he have a kit that he can
send out yet or he only does the installation down in FLA?

Thanks,
Jen :-)
