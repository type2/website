Subject: No oil pressure! Pump?

Hello, list. So, we were getting ready to start up my 73 the other day, for the first time since the engine has been back in. We decided to crank the engine until we could achieve oil pressure. The oil pressure sensor was hooked up, but as the engine cranked, the light would not turn off... &quot;What if it's a faulty sensor?&quot; we thought. We removed the sensor and cleaned it. Then, we cranked the engine to see if oil would squirt out of the hole the sensor came from. No oil. We squirted some in the hole just to see if that could help. No oil came back out. We thought that the pump might not be working. We decided to clean out the pressure relief valve located at the bottom rear of the engine. Still, no oil squirted out of the hole. We drained the oil and checked the screen for clealiness. Spik n' span. Refilled the engine and made sure the oil filter was full of oil. We tried squirting more oil in the sensor hole and then reinstalled the cleaned pressure sensor. The light would not turn
 off. So... 
 
Is my oil pump not working? Does it just need priming? If so, how do I do this beyond these smaller measures I've already taken? Has anyone ran into this before? It's been 2 years since the engine has been used. The oil pump worked two years ago. Do these things go bad with disuse atrophy? Does it need to be replaced? Any advice is appreciated. Thanks.                                           -Paul Deatherage
