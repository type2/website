I tried this with Rustoleum's high-temp BBQ/Stove paint when I
recently installed a single quiet-pack muffler on my 78.  The paint is
rated to 1000'F, and it's already blistering off the extractor pipe.
I've only driven the bus on about 4 short drives (&lt; 10 mi/each) since
the installation.

Anybody know any paints with higher temp rating?
