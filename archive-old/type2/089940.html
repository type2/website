Subject: Re: [T2] Help! Oil leaks without engine running? Help!

[...]
The drip after stopping may just be oil accumulation running off.  this 
can go for a while depending on where the oil is actually coming from.  
 From what you are describing I would check two things first.  all the 
push rods and the oil pressure sender.  Both of these items leak oil 
when running that can build up in areas that slowly leak back down to 
the bottom of the engine and make it look like your leaking parked.  get 
under there with engine cleaner so you can tell where it is coming 
from.  be aware that the fan can force oil all over the place and make 
finding some leaks very interesting.
