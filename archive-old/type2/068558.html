Subject: backup lights problems

The backup ligths died long ago on my '81.  I tracked it down
to what must be a dirty tranny switch, it registers a few ohms
on my meter.  This is enough to limit the current so that it
is inadequate to light the lights.  My solution was to mount
a horn relay in the engine compartment and run the backup lights
switch to the horn relay.  Doesn't take much current to fire up
the little relay.  The rekay is hooked up to the backup lights.

The relay cost maybe $3, and it makes this satisfying 'click'
every time I back up :)

Now I want to know where I can find some nice crimp on spade
connecters... the ones I'm using keep corroding :(  I want some
nice coppery ones instead of these dull silver ones.
