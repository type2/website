Subject: Re: [brake] resevoir cleaning

	I had good results cleaning crud out of the resevior for our '70
single cab using a LOT of brake cleaner, pieces of clean cotton rag
with lengths of coat-hanger wire wrapped around them as handles and
the size-XXXXXL pipe-cleaners sold in arts and crafts stores. I chose
the white pipe-cleaners, so the brake cleaner wouldn't disolve the dye...
	Just sloshing the brake cleaner around in the resevior didn't come
close to doing the job. With a soft swab it cleans up pretty quickly.
	I worked with the resivior in a clean oil-drain pan so I could collect
the dirty brake cleaner and let the crud settle for later re-use. Probably
used a whole can of cleaner on just the resevior and filler bottle. &amp;
the hose the connects them. Blech they were DIRTY!
	I'm sure I wore latext gloves during this operation, may have been
wearing the respirator too.
	Bill
