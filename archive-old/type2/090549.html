Subject: Bus sighting / Dual carbs vs. fuel injection

Man, I saw the COOLEST bus yesterday! It was raining
pretty hard and on the interstate, so I couldn't
pinpoint a year besides the bracket of &quot;baywindow.&quot;
They were on I-40 east and I was on I-40 West. The
whole bus had these GIANT pink &amp; white flowers
airbrushed all over it, stems and all. If that's your
bus, I must tell you I love the paint job... 

I hate to open up this thread again, but I've got to
get rid of by weber progressive. It's horrible in the
winter. Should I go dual carbs, or Jake Raby's CIS
fuel injection? I'm really having trouble deciding.
Maybe you all could throw some persuasive arguments
one way or the other to help me out....
                                  Thanks!
                                  Paul Deatherage
