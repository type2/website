Subject: swing lever bushings

bob -
if by swing-lever bushings you mean the center link pin in your axle 
beam, it is a Very worthwhile thing to do - you can tell if the 
bushings are worn by pushing up on the swing lever it should only 
rotate horizontally &amp; have no vertical play.  However, it is a tough 
job - it helps to have an air chisel and you will need a reamer to 
ream out the new bushings.  I've done two now, with good luck, but a 
friend did one and spent some time at the emergency room getting 
metal taken out of his eye.  Careful!!
