&gt; 1.  I just went to test fuel pressure and noticed something that 
&gt; doesn't seem right.  When I turn the ignition to the run position (not 
&gt; the start) position, the fuel pump runs continuously maintaining 38PSI. 
&gt;  I was under the impression that the fuel pump was not supposed to 
&gt; start until the starter was operated.

That's correct.  As Richard stated, you might have a wiring problem.  The
contacts in your AFM might also be misaligned, allowing them to close even
when the engine isn't running.  You can test this by measuring the
resistance across a couple pins at the plug (sorry, don't remember which
ones) or by pulling the top off the afm and looking at the contacts.  Just
make sure to stick it back on there nice and tight when you're done so dirt
doesn't get in.
