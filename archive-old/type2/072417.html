Hello.  I own a 1970 delux bus.  I have none of the gear mechs for the sun roof.  I open and close the roof by hand.  When it rains it comes into the bus. On cold days the air fills the bus when Im driving.  Ive placed some window seals bought from home depot along the outer edges within the roofs opening.  It helped out some yet not perfect and still rain will drip in.  Any suggestions?  Thanks Mike..
