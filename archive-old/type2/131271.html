Subject: Re: [T2]child seats and child comfort

Really?!?!?!?

Be right back... Time to go looking in mine... ;-)

That's awesome. My wife will be ecstatic. We bought our Volvo almost
exclusively because it had shoulder straps in the back seat. (In our $2k
price range. heh)

With a 13 year old son and a 1 year old daughter, safety is a big
concern....

&gt; Jerry-rigging isn't necessary to install 3-point seat belts in a bus.
&gt; The threaded holes for the shoulder harness are already in the frame-
&gt; covered by headliner material.  You might be able to feel along the
&gt; pillars to find them... For the middle seat, they're on the c-pillar,
&gt; about 3 inches up from the bottom of the side windows.  For the rear
&gt; seat, the holes are under the window/above the panel, about 2/3 back.
&gt; You just need to acquire a three-point belt.
