Yup... That's how it works. Theoretically.  In the real world, you will
find that that's how it works until you're backed into that perfect
campsite down by the creek.  Then Murphy's Law kicks in.  Like I said...
BTDT. Took walking about 6 miles out to run across a 4x4 to pull it up
the hill to a point where we could get behind it to jump start it.

Since moving the pickup from the coil to the alt light circuit, I've
never been unable to start the bus.

As always, YMMV.  Hook it up any way you want.

Jim
