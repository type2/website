Subject: Head interchangeability Or 2L heads needed

I am looking to get a set of 1800/2L heads, I am currently running 72-74
style Heat Exchangers and same with exhaust.  What year heads would I be
able to use without having to swap these out?  I know things chnaged over
the years and just want heads I can use.

I have the opportunity to buy a set of &quot;D&quot; port heads for a good price but
wanted to know if they would work or not.

Thanks in advance for any help.

And if you happen to have a good set of 1800/2L heads that you would be
willing to sell, Let me know that also..

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
