&gt;I saw those kits at Advanced
Auto to convert R12 systems to R134a and figured &quot;What have I got to

Chevy Van from R12 to R134, and paid $450.00 for them to do it. After my
experience with the Vanagon, I always wondered if the garage had simply
&gt;used a kit like I had for $30.00!

They probably did, but they also factored in the possibility of having a
major &quot;comeback&quot; if the oil in your system turned out to be incompatable,
as some can be.

How much vacuum is required to properly evacuate the AC?  I have a pretty
good vacuum pump in my lab...
