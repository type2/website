Subject: Re: [T2] CAD files in the archive idea

&gt; My concept is to just standardize on the fairly ubiquitous .pdf file for

&gt; reasonably efficient file format.

I would suggest creating plot files as well. for things like panel
patterns the user can send the plot file to a plot house w/out any cad
experience and have prints made on large format paper.
