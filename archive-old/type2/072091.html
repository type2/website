&gt;1 74 orange westy cusion rear hatch $30
ya know, you're playing a game i don't like, and it took all my compassion
for you not to copy this note to the type 2 list. i made a reasonable offer
for this item weeks ago. i need the pad. instead of getting back to me with
your reply - you bumped my offer up a little and put the item out to the
community. you could've told me you'd do it for thirty instead - or
something like that at the very friggin least.
