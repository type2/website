Subject: Re: [T2] Paint

I believe Napa makes a rattle can primer/sealer that should work well to =
cover any exposed metal you may have.  The notion that you're better =
doing nothing if you can't do it &quot;right&quot; is a bit presumptive.  Not =
everyone wants a $10,000 bus that will only provide $2,000 in insurance =
coverage when you total it.  I've got a bus that I painted in my =
driveway with spray cans. The bus has lots of non stock modifications =
and various duct tape/bailing wire fixes that work fine.  Plus it passes =
the 20/20 rule: It looks good from 20 feet away or at 20 mph.  I paid =
$800 for my bus and have put another $800 into it.  I can sell it for =
more than that in a pinch, and it does what I want ... get me from point =
A to point B reliably in a vehicle that I enjoy driving.  The people who =
want collectors cars won't get them painted at Maaco, but for those of =
us who are saving to get the $199 paint job that will last 5 years, =
shaker cans and Maaco are fine.  Plus ugly primer, rust, and dents are =
good pasive insurance -- the Lexxus and the pristine 63 Splitty will =
stay the hell out of your way -- they've certainly got more to lose.
