Rita and I joined some friends this weekend down at Matagorda beach for
a night.  It was a spur-of-the-moment, gotta-get-outta-town kind of
trip.  So on Thursday I tuned her up, cleaned her out, and packed her
up.  Friday morning we headed for the beach.

She rode well.  It was a beautiful day to own a VW bus.  The sun was
shining, the wind was at our back, and the temps were mild.  Got down
there without a problem, met with the others (non-bus people, but one
guy drives a Passat) and headed onto the beach.

Honestly, I'm not happy with myself for driving on the beach--its a
horribly non-enviro-friendly thing to do.  Mashes up all the critters
that live under the sand and keep the oceans clean, but well, here in
Texas it's accepted, and one bus wasn't going to hurt things.  Yeah,
yeah, I know.

The bus rode on the sand really well, certainly as well as any of the
non-4WD pickups out there.  The Passat got stuck, and we took it back,
and the bus could have kept going, except that, as I found out later,
the starter died.  So we stayed where we were and enjoyed the beach.
Popped the top and everyone was impressed with the fold out table.  Good
place to keep the brews out of the sand.  Speaking of sand, Rita brought
back half the beach with her.  I'm going to have to go hose her down,
and probably snake the shop vac for a day to get it all out.

Stayed that night in Rita, right on the beach.  Very quiet.  Very
soothing.  There was a nice breeze through the night that kept things
very cool.  The only thing that could have improved the night would have
been female companionship. :)

The next morning, after getting out quota of playtime, we got Rita down
onto the hard sand, and in a comical scene, got her started by popping
her into gear.  Drove out, sorted out the gear (all the while keeping
Rita running) and then hit the highway.  I had 3/4 tank of gas, which I
calculated could get me home if I drove conservatively (52mph).  That
was okay, since Saturday was at least as nice as Friday.

I made some calls to FLAPS on the way home, located a starter in
Houston, picked it up, and kept on driving.  Got home, unloaded the
essentials, and went inside.

Today I put in the new starter.  It's a brand new Bosch, Hecho en Mexico
part, but being that it was all I could find, it'll do.  It's a lot
noisier than the old starter--a lot more whirr noise.  I don't know if
that's normal, so if anyone has bothered to read this far and is wise in
such matters, let me know.  It works at any rate.

The vital statistics are as follows:

Round trip miles travelled: ~260
MPG (for the way down):  21.5
Pros:  Bus drove on sand well, rode nicely.  Camper proves its worth
again.
Cons:  Starter died

That's about it.  I've got a few other thoughts related to this, but
I'll put it in a second part, as this one has gotten long.  Thanks for
listening.
