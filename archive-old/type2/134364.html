Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel pump cut-out alternative

From: &quot;Mike Soultanian&quot; &lt;msoultan_at_csulb_dot_edu&gt;
&gt; When you get in an accident, it will shut off the bus.  This is not
&gt; needed for stock FI setups, though, because there is a built in
&gt; mechanism to handle shutting off the fuel pump if the engine isn't
running.
&gt; However, I guess it would still be handy if you got in an accident and
&gt; the engine was still running....

I'm going to look into picking one up at the boneyard.  I was going to do
the relay thing, but this seems simpler to do.

I've got an 1.8L, single carb in a '77 bay.  The bus use to have FI at one
time in the distant past, and has an after market electric fuel pump.

Interestingly enough, I recently had the engine replaced and the &quot;new&quot;
engine has a stock fuel pump mounted on it.  The inlet and outlet are
crimped shut.  I don't know if it works.
