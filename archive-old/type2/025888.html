&gt; hi all - i have a syncopated scraping noise when turning in my 68 and it is
&gt; coming from the rear drum area. sure enough it happens when i brake, and
&gt; the drums do need a girinding! BUT the scraping also occurs when i haven't
&gt; used the brake for a longish period, during a left or right turn. the sound
&gt; is so similar as one coming from a shoe/drum. who knows what it could be -
&gt; still the drums and shoes..? tia      - steve

Broken spring or broken hold-down pin, maybe; pulling off the drum and
looking inside would be a very good idea.
