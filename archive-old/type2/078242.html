Volks,

The negative cable that came from the factory was a braided copper
assembly with no insulation whatsoever on all VWs thru at least 1980
(latest one I own).  Any insulated negative cable is a replacement,
whatever the color of the cover.  If you have an insulated negative cable
(or ground strap, as it is also known) I have a suggestion...  Remove the
insulation!!! Especially if it is colored anything other than black or
brown.  It serves no purpose, since the whole point of this cable is to be
in constant contact with the body of the car. Take a utility knife or
single edge razor blade, slit the length of the insulation and peel it
off.  This will prevent you or any future owner from experiencing the
problem that Milo did.
