Try using a small pair of channellock pliers to remove the piston.  Put
the head of the pliers inside the piston, pull the handles apart, and see
if you can move the piston.  Try rotating as well as pulling.

If it is well frozen, you might be in a replacement mode.  Don't waste too
much time on it.
