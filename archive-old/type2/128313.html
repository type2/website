Subject: Re: [T2] cheap replacement muffler

Hi Mike, 

Cheapo mufflers? 

Forgot to mention that I obviously reused the old
flange and pipe, I split the old rusted can off with a
chisel and cleaned it all up, clamped the new muffler
on straight pipe that was *inside* the old muffler..

So, it's quite a kluge.. But got me out of a fix, and
has been good enough that I've left it that way for a
few months now!
