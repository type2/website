&gt; Hi Volks.
&gt; I want to swap a dash, putting a 70 dash into my 69.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone done this?
&gt; 
&gt; It looks like the padded vinyl part DOES NOT separate from the top metal
&gt; part which goes forward to underneath the windshield.
&gt; 
&gt; I noticed two (or is it three?) large phillips screws on either side, in the
&gt; front door posts, and a series of smaller screws in the top near the bottom
&gt; edge of the windshield (screw heads covered by black plastic caps)
&gt; 
&gt; I imagine you have to remove the steering wheel and column brace, e-brake
&gt; lever too.
&gt; 
&gt; So how hard/easy is it?

You need an impact driver. It's not hard, but those screws will be TIGHT!

Take out all of the screws you saw. Then remove the instrument cluster; you
don't have to unhook all the wires unless you're changing it. Disconnect the
heater controls. Now look under the dash where the e-brake lever comes up,
and where the column brace is. There are screws under there, and they need
to come out.

Pull gently. Either the dash will come out or it won't; if it doesn't, look
for screws, brackets, etc., and remove.

Finally, slip the dash out the passenger door.

I removed mine with the windshield out.

Get well, Mary!
