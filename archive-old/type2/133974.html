Subject: bus depot charcoal canister

I recently ordered a new charcoal canister for my 74 from Bus Depot. 

The one I got is cylindrical, whereas the original canister (on every bus
that I've seen, including mine) is ovoid. It was impossible to mount to
the firewall using the stock bracket, which is welded in place. 

Does the original shape of canister exist? If not, how are people mounting
this cylinder on their buses? 

Thanks 
Dan
