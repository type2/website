Subject: Inverters: $/Watt

Re: Inverters: $/Watt
 
The latest Harbor Freight (HF) catalog includes a variety of inverters (12VDC -
120vac).  I remember some recent questions on sources and costs, so thought I'd
pass this on:
 
Peak Load (W)   Continuous Load (W)   Cost (US$)   Cost/W (Cont.)  Part No.
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   3000                 1500            399.99         0.27        33584-2BHA
   1000                  600            199.99         0.33        33583-1BHA
    600                  300             79.99         0.27        33582-0BHA
    250                  140             39.99         0.29        33581-0BHA
     80                   50             29.99         0.60        35405-0BHA
 
Add a bit for taxes or shipping where applicable and $0.30/continuous watt
seems to be a reasonable rule-of-thumb above 100W.
My experience with HF is that they offer steep discounts (30% to 50%) on many
items while the rest are +-10% of local retail (Dallas, TX).  I'd guess that
these inverter prices are probably similar to what they could be obtained for
from other discount outlets.  I've not ordered any of these particular items;
so cannot comment on their quality.  The couple of times I've used HF for other
things have been fine.
 
I have no interest in HF, but include the following contact info for anyone
who wants to check further:

Phone for US orders is 800.423.2567.  Their International Order line is
805.388.3000.
 
Currently no shipping charges on orders over $50 within the continental US.
