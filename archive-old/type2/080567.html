Subject: re:Fuel Fill Hose, Filler neckto tank 72-79 Bus 

Theodore asked about filler hose parts for his van.

Here's what I did faced with the same problem:
I bought the outer elbow new, and went to NAPA or
another local parts house and bought a chunk of fuel
resistant hose of the right diameter to fit the tank. 
Then I bought a metal exhaust elbow that fit the hose
and was the right angle (think I got it at NAPA, and
can't find the part number now) and trimmed it's
length a bit to fit.  
So, starting at the outside filler cap on the bus:
First, the new rubber VW style outer elbow.
Next, a length of rubber hose.
Third, piece of metal elbow.
Then, another chunk of the rubber hose.
Then the gas tank filler neck itself.
Everything fit pretty snugly, no slop, and I used hose
clamps on all connections.
I think that I bought about a food of the rubber hose,
and cut it into two pieces.  Sorry, don't recall the
lengths, or the brand or part number, but it worked
fine the rest of the summer--instant cure for gas
smell in the van--the old stuff had some nasty cracks
and breaks in it.
I'm sure anyone qualified to work on their bus can
figure out what to do from my description.  If not,
get a knowledgable friend to help, look it over when
it's apart, and think a bit.
Hope that this helps, and good luck.

Jim in WI, with the 65 dc and the 75 van tucked away
in the shed for winter.  (what winter!??)
