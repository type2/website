Subject: VW logo break light

just an info on a novelty item: I got a VW logo break light. Now I 
have to put it on &quot;Jenny&quot;. It shipped in 8 days ($10.50) and I had no 
problems whatsoever with the vendor. It took 8 days to get here. They 
also have some other items which might be of interest.
