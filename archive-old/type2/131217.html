Subject: RE: [T2] type IV engine stand

     I hadn't really thought about the type IV motor tipping the stand over. 
  I guess I'll just weld on another bar with a set of castors on the front 
of my cheap stand.  Better yet maybe just a plate so I can bolt the new set 
of wheels on and take it off for working/starting.  Something like that.
     Oh well, I'll add a few extra feet of wire to my push button starter so 
I can stand around the corner with my fingers crossed when I fire it up :-)
