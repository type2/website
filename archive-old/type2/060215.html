&gt; &gt;&gt; Later I found out that the proper
&gt; &gt;&gt; operating temperature is 125-158...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Could that be the correct temp in degrees C?
&gt;
&gt; I considered that too, but it would be too hot, wouldn't it?

Let's see: 125 * 9/5 + 32 =  257 F

So if you say that 250 F is normal it's not very far off. However 158 seems
a bit high.

158 * 9/5 + 32 = 316 F
