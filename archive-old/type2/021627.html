Paul,

Yes, it will require welding.  You'll need to drill out the spot welds
on the Vanagon tracks and grab those as well as the seats.  You'll need
to weld those into your bus after removing the stock hardware.

Other 'gotchas':

If your 72 has the fresh air ducts on the doors, there will be
interference with the armrests.

Rotation of the seats is doubtful without removing the partition. This
was done on the '78 and later Westies so it *can* be done, but you'll
want to take a look at one of the later buses to see how the factory did it.

Price? Whatever you have to pay...  Mine were free with a $100 parter Vanagon.

A lot of work, but well worth it.

Jim

&gt; I'm looking at nice set of captain's chairs from an '83 (i think)
&gt; vanagon to go in my '72 Westy but I'm unsure about compatibility.  Could
&gt; someone tell me how easy/difficult it is going to be to install these
&gt; seats and what problems I'm likely to run into.  Will it require welding
&gt; them in or bolting them down?  I'm pretty sure they rotate, will they
&gt; still be able to rotate in the Bay with the partition behind the seats?
&gt; Any help would be appreciated.
&gt; Thanks in advance.
&gt; also - what would be a normal/decent price for these seats?
