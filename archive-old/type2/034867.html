&gt; &lt;&lt; A friend is looking for a gas heater for his '71 Westy project. He
would
&gt;  &gt; prefer the BA6, complete and working. I offered to ask y'all. Anything
&gt;  &gt; out there? &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; '71's a bit different, the heater is bolted to the engine tin on a small
&gt; stand (one of the benefits of the upright) and the ducting into the
passenger
&gt; compartment is fairly easy to unbolt. Prob seems to be cutting the holes
in
&gt; the right places. The one I found for my '70 is a BN4 so I dont know how
much
&gt; different the BA6 is. Check the library for some great tech tips
