Subject: Re: [T2] Insurance Questions

Well, I know that non-drinking probably doesn't go with owning a bus, but...

I have my insurance with GuideOne.  Just the bus, one driver, 47 yo, no
tickets/accidents (in last 7 years), non-drinker/smoker (sounds awful, don't
it? {grin}), and some (?) number of years in residence and work.  I've got
not-quite minimal insurance with non-insured driver coverage.  It comes to
something like $500.00 per year.  No kidding.

With the Sentra on the policy, it didn't quite double the cost.
