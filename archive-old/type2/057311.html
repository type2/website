						16 August 1998

Today was cool. I saw two restored VW buses on the road...One a 21 and
one a single cab. Its nice to see these babies restored and strutting
their stuff. That's what its all about.

As a side note my 69 daily has a crank up sun roof in the back...that got
ripped off, when it was up, by a tree....Anyone in the  Northern Cali
area got one floating around?
Email me...

Thanks 

Greg
