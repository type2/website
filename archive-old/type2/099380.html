Subject: RE: [T2] Upgrading to H4s

Yo Dave!!

Good reply-----

Let me give you this picture---

I have several welder's---
One being a Lincoln AC /DC buzz box.

Ok I have a set of 50 foot extension wires that I have to use
occasionally to get to places the leads on the welder are much too short
for---

Lets say I have the welder set at 200 amps--at the end of them 50 ft.
cables at the work--I am really welding at about 150 amps.( welding work
is done via amps not volts)

There is a loss of amperage at length--I measured it. ( unless you
double the size of the wire or increase the power supply)

So with this case scenario--the same is true with any length of
wire----whatever may be the supply source.

The greater the distance the bigger the wire must be, or you lose
amperage at the other end ( and in correct circumstances  voltage )  

No I am not blind in one eye to another idea--but my thought process is
why go to all the trouble when it isn't really necessary? 

We're not trying to light up a set of searchlights here--( are we ?
)----:&gt;)

Please cease and desist in being confounded-----It's just me---
