Subject: Busses on the South Fork - Rafting

Open call to bussers for a rafting trip in northern CA!

Where:  http://www.malode_dot_com/
When:   July 7-10  Mon-Thurs

Arrive in camp on Mon 7th.
Chili Bar run morning of Tues 8th.
Gorge run afternoon of Wed 9th.
Leave morning Thurs 10th.

Folks can come for all or part.  Each rafting trip is $89 (looks like
they've raised it $10 this year).  And camping is about $12 a night per
person.  Discounts if we get a boodle of people.

Mother Lode River Center's campground is beautifully improved right on
the river, with full bath and kitchen facilities - it's where the chili
bar run ends and the gorge run begins.  Their guides are trustworthy and
loads of fun!  The chili bar run is a class 3 - nothing too crazy, the
gorge run a bit hairier, but nothing that a quasi stalwart first timer
can't handle.  For more info, see the website.

RSVP to me if you're interested!

Teri
