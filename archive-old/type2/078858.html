Subject: red light on

I replaced the instrument cluster in my bus.
disconnected the + cable before I did the work.
the speedometer still doesn't work, but that's not the
big problem.

i put the idiot, turn and illumination lights into the
new cluster exactly as I took them out of the old one,
but now the red generator light will not go out. It
gets a little brighter when i rev, but doesn't go out.

I checked and double checked connections--including
battery. Frustrated.

1. My generator charging system was working perfectly.

2. Belt is fine.

3. Since the last thing I did was pull out the idiot
lights, etc. and reinstall them, i gotta figure i did
something wrong there.

I'm hoping i did something stupid in a common way.
Help.
