Subject: Re: [T2] Vacuum Idle Retard connection - 71 DP

This is wrong. The retard goes to the manifold

&gt; Now for the retard, you can see the available nipple on the distributer. 
&gt; Now, on the back of the carb is this
&gt;
&gt; http://www.gigagreg_dot_com/images/carb.jpg
&gt;
&gt; In the upper right corner of the picture you can see the unit attached to 
&gt; the back of the carb.  There are two connections, the one on the right is 
&gt; hooked up to the carb.  The one on the left is blocked off.  Is this where 
&gt; I should attach to the distributer?

This thing is called a dash pod and is not for your dist. Lets leave that 
for a later date. If you look in the pic just behind the spring on your 
throttle lever you'll see a rubber nipple. I believe this is the ventury 
port blocked off. Make sure by reving the engine and feeling a vacuum. If 
not look around the carb body in that area or around the neck of the body 
for another port and that is the advance vacuum port.
