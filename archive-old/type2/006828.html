Subject:      Re; insurance

When insuring a teenager driver my agent gave me a great tip. Our 17 yr
old teenager had a 71 bug, her dad gave her a 90 Isuzu trooper. The
insurance for the trper would be $1600 A YEAR. My agent said not to sell
the bug, but it was already sold. The Trper has collision and a 500
deductable. But.. if we add a beater, or whatever, and have minimum
liability insurance then the Trper with the same coverage dropped to
$450 per year. The beater is my case is my 64 std micro that someday
will be drivable and slowly be solid and of course a &quot;thing of joy and
beauty to behold forever&quot;. Even if I don't drive it and still have it
insured, I am very many dollars ahead from the $1600 that I would have
to put out. It only makes insurance sense, not common sense. Something
to the effect that the lower common vehicle is attributed to the lowest
common driver. And what could be lower than a teenage driver, right....
        Boy will I catch it for that.     John
