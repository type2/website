Subject: new factory 1600DP motors??

Hi all,
There was a post recently about the VW factory stopping production of 
assembled 1600 motors.
I believe there was also a link to a web page with details.
Unfortunately I have lost the post, and can't find it back now that I need 
it.
Does anyone have the link or the details for me?
Cheers,
Richard
