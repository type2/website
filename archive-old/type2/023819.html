Before doing surgery to your aft right cabinet furniture, you might evaluate 
this non intrusive and inexpensive alternative. Obtain a used interior rear 
view mirror (I used an old bus unit), saw off the support arm to about 1.5&quot; 
&gt;from the ball socket. Using a small SS hose clamp, affix it above your 
internal mirror near the top of its vertical support by clamping the 1.5&quot; 
stub to the upper portion of the mirror support. This second upper mirror can 
now be oriented to look through the sliding door window and down into the 
blind spot obscured by the wardrobe cabinet.
