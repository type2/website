Subject: Loose Axle nut. Other weird noises.

Hi volks,
               I was looking into some strange noises that my '77 camper has been making recently and found that the 46mm castellated nut on the
left rear wheel was loose- it was held in place by the split pin but I could move it with my fingers.
 Can I just tighten this up and forget about it or should I be digging deeper? Why does it need to be so tight, anyway? Should I be paying homage to some greater power that I found this before it found me?
 I think this probably accounts for the &quot;wierd scraping sound on right hand bends&quot;. 
 Can anyone offer any suggestions as to what the &quot;peculiar humming noise&quot; might be? This one is roadspeed related and sounds a little like an off-road tyre drumming on pavement. Not very loud (below ~20mph it's inaudible and over 45 or so the wind noise swamps it). It doesn't seem to be affected at all by brakes or throttle, nor to change much on cornering. I can't tell where it's coming from either, with any confidence- I think it's the front but may be imagining it. Wheel bearing, maybe? Can I identify a bad bearing by jacking it up and spinning it or will it sound OK unloaded?

Thanks for any suggestions.

Cheers,
              W.
