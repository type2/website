Subject: [T2] Pictures of Pick-up online

Hi Volks!

I wrote about my newly acquired '77 Widebed Pick-up and Long-wood 
Trailer the other day (you might remember, the US$ 70 combo), and 
promised to upload pictures ASAP.  Well, here they are, of both 
vehicles in as-bought condition:

Have fun...

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
