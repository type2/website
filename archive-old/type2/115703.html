Subject: Re: [T2] More Deck Height Confusion

on 6/20/03 11:55, William L Fargo related:

&gt; volks,
&gt; 
&gt; thanks for all the good advice, i now have a good understanding of how to
&gt; do all the calculations and whatnot. i have no trouble calculating my
&gt; sweep volume, but my deck volume is still eluding me. what exactly is the
&gt; deck height and how do i measure it.

deck height is the distance between the top of the piston at TDC and the top
of the cylinder. typically it is close to 0.060&quot;. it can be as small as
0.035&quot;, but most people think close to 0.060 is good. smaller deck means
more CR, all else being equal.

to measure the deck, the pistons are attached to the rods and the cylinders
installed on the case and torqued.  you need to be careful doing this
because it is easy to break the fins of the cylinders if you don't do it
right. engine builders use a torque plate to hold the cylinders but you can
improvise something. you can leave the rings off the pistons if you want to
for this step, it makes turning the motor easier. washers and spacers are
needed to bear on the cylinder tops, since the heads are missing the studs
stick up way above the cylinder top. don't apply torque to the top fin,
apply it to the cylinder top edge. 15 ft-lbs is fine for this, not the full
23.

once everything is in place, rotate the piston to TDC and use a feeler gauge
and a straight edge to measure the distance between the piston top and the
cylinder top. this is your deck height. you should do all the cylinders and
write it  all down. you can also use a dial gauge to measure this distance,
if you have the jig to do it this way. you can also use the plunge end of a
caliper, with the caliper body on the cylinder top and the plunge tip on the
piston top.
