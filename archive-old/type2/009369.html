Subject: Free parts exchange on the honor system
Message-Id: &lt;199905131648.JAA21622_at_helix.ucsd_dot_edu&gt;

The following is an idealistic notion.

Last week, when our beloved list administrator asked us about ebay, I 
replied with what I consider an &quot;ideal.&quot; The ideal is that if you have a 
part, you offer it to the list and charge nothing for it. Maybe postage. 
Maybe not. In the best of all possible worlds, over time, everything 
would even out.

And if you needed a part, you could ask for it and expect a response 
without a price tag and not feel embarrased to accept it.

Now I want to propose this to the list. It has already been an informal 
policy for some people. I think that Karl von Salzen does this (on the 
giving end) a lot. I also know that there are some parts that everyone 
wants, and choosing who to give it to might sometimes be difficult.

The notion of a free parts exchange on the honor system is not intended 
to impune anyone who makes all or part of their living by selling parts. 
Ron, Steve Lashley, Jim, others: we need you guys.

Steven, if you want to eighty-six this idea, that's certainly your place.

Please don't reply to the list, even tomorrow (Friday). Send me a p-mail 
and cc one to Steven, if that's okay with him. Some on the list will 
think this is a pinko idea -- p-flame me. To make it work, we will have 
to have a kind of 'contract.'

Once again, I know that this already occurs on the list. I am just 
looking to make the ideal more a part of everyday life.
