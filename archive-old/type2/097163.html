Subject: Re: [T2] Converting 76 CA bus to 72-74 exhaust

&gt; Since I am in SC, I am thinking of swapping my heater boxes/exhaust to 72-74
&gt; style.................I guess I have to swap the left side intake runner,
&gt; too.............
&gt;
&gt; Would this work for me?  Anything else I am missing?  The distributor that
&gt; is on it has 2 nipples, too............

Not sure why you think you need to swap the intake runner.....

Are you keeping the fuel injection? The dual vacuum unit you have will work
fine. (this tells me your 76 bus was built before 1/76)

Besides the 72-74 heater boxes and muffler, you will need to find these
additional parts:
72-74 L and R lower tin, under the pushrods.
72-74 L lower front tin.
79 R lower front tin.
72-74 or 79 L and R heater pipe between the boxes and the flapper valves.
72-74 alternator support/adjusting bracket.
72-74 or 79 L and R air pipes between the heater fan and the top of the heater
boxes.
