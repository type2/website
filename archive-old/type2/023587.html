Subject: Those Funky Little Knobs
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

You know, the ones for the heater and fresh air control.  The little blue and 
red gizmos?  Well, I have a 70 Bus so I have the metal arm and plastic knob 
variety.  Actually I only have one knob so that's what this post is all 
about.  Can I pull out these metal arms and replace them with the later 
all-plastic jobs?  If the newer all plastic ones will fit (and I'd guess that 
they would) how do I attach them to the control levers?  I'm assuming here 
that the little plastic presspin which is holding them together now is going 
to be thoroughly mangled if I attempt to remove it.  And lastly, but 
certainly not leastly, does anybody out there in Listland have a good source 
for these little knobs?
