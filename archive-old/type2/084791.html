Subject: Re: [T2] Aftermarket Tents

Chuck,
I see all this stuff on side mounted tents, and I keep thinking.........
Once the tent is set up, you are stuck to it.

A separate tent allows you to stash your stuff in a bit more security than 
just setting things outside on the picnic table, and you can drive away and 
return later.

During our last year trip of 7 months and 25,000 miles I cannot tell you 
the number of times that we would have found an attached tent to be a pain.

Our use of a separate tent on those few occasions when we used it allowed 
us to have more freedom of decision on what we might do during the day or 
evening.

I have come to really believe that an attached tent is not what it was 
cracked up to be, nor is it what we still think it to be.

Buy a cheap separate tent, and pitch it if it becomes all torn up as a 
function of time;
then buy another.

Remember, for really terrible storms, everybody is gonna be in the bus 
anyhow, so the tent is pretty much a fair weather to mild bad weather item.

Original side tents have charisma and look kewel.
Beyond that, I can't find a reason to have something else to worry about as 
to fragility, care, proper storage, preparation for storage, etc.
