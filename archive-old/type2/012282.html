Subject: Hella hard start relay
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

I put up a quick dwg./schematic on installing a
Hella hard start relay.
http://www.geocities_dot_com/magicbus1974/HSrelay.jpg

Also a schematic type dwg of the shift linkage coupler
and some words..

As you can see they are both images... not to big I dont
think. they load pretty quickly for me.... anyway a picture
is worth 1000 words... right?

My dog is usually pleased with what I do, 
because he is not infected with the concept of what I &quot;should&quot; be doing.
