Subject: Pilot Bearing In Crank - How to Remove?
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

 &gt;I'd like the remove the old pilot bearing, but it is not in
&gt;he flywheel like the archives say, it's in the crankshaft.
&gt;No puller at local flaps, but I got a lifter puller I may try.  Now I
&gt;read about the hydraulic method of stuffing the bearing cavity with oily
&gt; My worry is what this pounding can do to the crankshaft journals- is this 
concern &gt;warranted?? any ideas for a puller?

I removed one from my friends 81 bus last year, and followed up with my own 
on my 74 motor a couple of months ago. It's was tedious but not impossible. 
The lifter puller
doesn't really work, the puller from the flaps - you can rent one, we rented 
on and it eventually worked, but we broke it. We put a 2&quot;X4&quot; crossways on the 
ground abutting the motor under the engine bolts, set up the tool, then used 
two cheater pipes leveraged against the board standing straight up on either 
side of the tool. one guy pulls on the pipes while the assistant uses a 5lb 
sledgehammer strategically. Anyway, we got it out but we broke the tool and 
it wasn't a german way to do it. The most recent one I did, I was in a rush 
so I knocked out all the needle bearings inside,
then used a bastard file to cut a groove into the outside wall until it was 
almost through to the crank, then I used a very small flathead screwdriver 
and gently tap tap tapped the loose ends up, then pulled the whole mess out 
with a needle nose pliers. This method is quicker, still not the german way, 
and when I got a look at the hole where it sat, it looked like others had 
done similar jobs earlier. I got everything back together though using 
Wilson's instructions, including permatex on the 0-ring and cleaning all the 
burrs off the main seal area before installing the seal. It hasn't leaked at 
all in the 500 miles since, at least not from the main seal - still have to 
cure a few pushrod drops.
