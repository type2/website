Subject: brake line clip
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL - S

list, i have tried the archives here without success.
in the process of preparing to work on the rear brakes
of a 70 camper i have found that the hoses in the back
(and probably the front, too) are held by clamps that
appear to just slide up and off. appear is my
operative word as i have found that an initial prying
effort didn't seem to do much. on the principle of
applying no force without being reasonably sure i'm
not going to snap someting, i decided to see if anyone
has a good way to approach these puppies and also to
ask if i should be prepared to replace them with new
ones or just clean and reuse the old ones.            
bob
