Subject: Re: [T2] I Smell Gas Fumes on Mountain Passes

I get the slight odor with my westy as well.  The thing is that gas 
vaporizes quicker at higher altitudes which means even the most minute 
vapor leak is going to be noticed.  I got rid of almost all of my gas 
odors by replacing the lines to the canisters.

&gt; This is something I've noticed over the years, but have never been able 
&gt; to diagnose or fix (maybe there IS no fix):
&gt; When I'm driving my '79 bus with fool injection over high mountain 
&gt; passes, I sometimes smell gasoline fumes near the top of the pass. Once 
&gt; I'm over the top of the pass, the odor goes away until I'm near the top 
&gt; of another high mountain pass. This happens only on huge passes like 
&gt; Monarch Pass (11,312 feet) in Colorado, which climbs over the Great 
&gt; Divide.
&gt; Everything on the bus is pretty much stock, and I had the air flow 
&gt; meter adjusted, after the engine rebuild, by a knowledgeable specialist 
&gt; who used a big expensive exhaust gas analyzer. The smell sometimes 
&gt; still occurs near the top of the pass.
&gt; Could it have someting to do with the fuel vapor canister, which is 
&gt; hooked up, but has never been replaced?
&gt; It's not a major problem; the bus still runs fine. I just wonder if 
&gt; anyone else has experienced this.
