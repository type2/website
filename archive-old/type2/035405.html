&gt;  renoir here,
&gt;  where did you find them for $39?
&gt;  thanks


a quick scan of the major veedub mags yielded this result:
so cal imports-$47.95
kustom 1 warehouse-$47.95
chirco-52.95
komet-42.95

i then checked my old receipts and found the cheapest i had spent (4 years
ago) was at komet in california.  they were a newer company then and prices
were super cheap.  i bought 4 blue coils _at_ $9 each!!  anyways the
*compu-fire* one i bought from them (same as pertronix just different
company)..was for $38.95 plus tax and shipping.  so i guess they have gone
up in price.  my crane/allison was $120 and i have had that one about 6-7
years.  all still work great.  so, i would shop around, it is the same
product anywhere, no need to pay $60 for it if you can get it cheaper
elsewhere.

hope that helps.

zzz
