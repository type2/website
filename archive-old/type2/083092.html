Someone before mentioned the mounting of a Vortec V6 in a bus.

A guy here Down Under by the name of Kimm Garland has put in his bus a standard GM supercharged 3.8litre V6 from a local GM car by the name of a Holden Statesman.

He has an amazing set up that includes huge ducting from scoops in front of the rear wheels to a cooling box with twin radiators mounted in it.

He had the radiator bleed problems you guys mentioned &amp; for 2 weeks after installing the V6 had to be careful about how hard he ran the engine to avoid overheating &amp; it was parked on a slope each evening so he could check out the coolant level each morning.

Sure enough it took the full 2 weeks to get out all of the air.

As far as the cooling box goes, the bus is a Dual Cab so while there's plenty of room under the tray in it, for a standard Kombi or Microbus the radiator solutions mentioned before on this thread would have to be explored.

You can check out Kimm's methods at the http://kruizinwagon_dot_com.au on the Buses section in the index.

He owns Indian Automotive &amp; specialises in V6 &amp; V8 conversions for buses as well as heaps of bus suspension &amp; chassis gear.
