Subject: New 71, coupla issues

I just picked up a new '71 Westy over the weekend, great shape, complete rebuild, minimal rust etc.  However, when the guy delivered it, I noticed it was idling a little fast. It has the dreaded 009 dizzy w\34pict3 carb.  Anyway, I set the timing and tried to adjust the idle with the carb screws and found that when I had the carb adjusted to about the right idle speed, the rpms seemed to speed up and slow down on its own will occasionally.  I fear I may need a new carb.  Anyone got any advice??


Peace, John Baker
