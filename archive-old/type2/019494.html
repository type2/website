Hi Garp,

If your conversion to a 1641 did not include a semi-hemi cut to the heads to
increase the combustion chamber volume, dished pistons, or spacers between
the cylinders and case, the compression has been raised to a point you can
not deal with it by retarding the spark.  Another avenue to explore is to
richen up your carb's mixture by putting in a larger main jet in the area of
a #135 to a #140.  (Stock should be a #125.)  A step or two colder heat range
spark plug should also help, as cold as you can use without fouling.    Are
you running premium fuel?  In a heavy vehicle such as a bus, I prefer an
earlier spec vacuum advance distributor, set to 3 - 5 degrees initial
advance.  It is load dependent and the bus is usually under load just pushing
all that air out of the way.

More if you'd like.

If your trip brings you by Ukiah, California, I can help you out.  Bring the
6 pack.

Keep smiling,

Mike
