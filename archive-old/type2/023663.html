There appears to be some gas coming out of my gas cap.  I have twin weber
carbs the hose for the gas vent has no place to go.  Could this possibly have
anything to do with gas being forced out of my gas cap.  I used to get
excellent milage and since i replaced my fuel pump it has since gone down the
toilet, i'm trying to figure out what it could be.  But i always notice there
is gas leaking from the gas cap, i don't know how that is possible, any ideas?
Maybe I should light a match to see in my gas tank for leaks.
