Subject: More info on Subaru bus on eBay

I just received another email where the seller says that the bus drives
great.  She also stated &quot;and the volkswagen shop said it was an option it is
alot like the subaru brat motor they said&quot;  I'm sure that this VW shop loves
the type of owners that don't know anything about their cars.
