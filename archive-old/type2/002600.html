Thanks all for responding to my downshifting ignorance and encouraging me to
install a sweet panel instead of a headliner, i can get some 4x8 sheets for
$10.(way cheaper then the $100 or so for a headliner) thanks!!!
question #..da da daaaaaa &quot;3&quot;
 While driving Ive been noticing some smoke from the enging
compartment...(sh#t!) Upon further examination I found the source to be a
tube coming from poss the exhaust up into the engine comp. aoorix 1/2 inch
thick. There is what looks like  2 inches of garden hose attached to it with
a odd smaller spark plug attached to the end of that? What the hell is that?
what is it sparking? At any rate its not really clamped to the&quot;spigget tube
thing&quot; and exhaust is streaming into compartment upon acceleration.. I have
a camper is this the part of some sort of... i dont know.. thing? hehe
    I just want to cap it off rather then clamp it down, there are no wires
or anything going to it. I wish I could show yall a pic. Unless someone is
reading this thinking&quot; you moron, its your Johnson Rod Flange!&quot; or
something. IT SCARES ME!

thnx!!
