&gt; &gt; WHAT WOULD CAUSE A BUS TO COME OUT OF FOURTH GEAR? THE SHIFTER CAN BE
&gt; &gt; TIED BACK AND IT WILL STAY IN. THIS IS IN A 68.
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry to say, Mike, but the clock is ticking and you will need a rebuilt
&gt; transmission, or a good used one.

It can also be gearshifter adjustment...

My 71 bus was popping out of 4th on deceleration, frequently and
repeatedly.

I adjusted the shifter and it stopped... I have been using the same
transaxle for another 15-20k miles with not a problem.

Make sure its the transaxle before you rebuild it.  Rebuilds are expensive
and never last as long as a good original (with 0 miles, hehe find one of
those)

take care,

Steve
