&gt; I am having tropuble with my FI on the 78' Westy 2.0. I believe I am the
&gt; victim of corrosion because my bus ran great the last time I drove it (3
&gt; weeks ago) and always has run great. The only thing that has happened to it
&gt; since the last drive is the elapsing of 3 weeks of damp and cold weather.
&gt; Bus starts but refuses to idle/ continue running without constant pumping
&gt; of the gas pedal.

This is VERY classic for &quot;one of your vacuum hoses has come loose.&quot;  Have
you taken a vacuum reading lately?

&gt; I am going to start testing the FI this weekend but figured before I
&gt; get busy with the test light and ohm meter I would clean all of the
&gt; electrical connections in the engine compartment.

This is, of course, never a bad thing to do but I would check vacuum.  If
your vacuum is over 15&quot; I would check the dwell angle and the timing.  I
would say that well over 99% of the &quot;FI problems&quot; that I see are actually
vacuum or ignition problems. Of course, then I would recommend freshening
all your electrical connections or at least dis- and re-connecting them.

&gt; What I am wondering is what do you guys like to use to prevent
&gt; corrosion from returning?

I use a compound called &quot;Noalox&quot;.  It is an anti-oxidation and anti-sieze
compound for aluminum wiring and it (or an analog) is available at any
electrical supply house. While it is not specific for copper or for
automotive use it does seem to work.  The problem with being definite is
that I have not seen any cars 30 years later after I used this treatment
on them (yet).

                             OOK!
