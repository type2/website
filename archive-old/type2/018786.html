Hi volks,
Well just got in second wreck in less than a month. Neither my fault.
First one someone ran a stop sign and t-boned my sliding door.  Well
Monday, Someone rear-ended me at a stop light and ran.  The cops caught
her though.  Any way my sliding door is toast and my rear apron is now
in my engine compartment.  Well the reason I am writing is I can get a
78 with working sunroof no dents, no glass  for cheap.  How much of the
73 with an 1800 will fit in the 78?  The engine /tranny?  Any mods
necessary?  Is all the glass the same size?  Please help with any info
you might have about 78's in particular.

Peace brothers and sisters,
Snoopy (busless and not very happy)
