Subject: RE: anyone have a good louvered (jalousie) window they would
  part

Paul, where are you located?

I plan to go to the Campbelltown PA VW show this weekend, and I may take

-  jalousie window(s) [I have three, plus extra glass panes], and

-  one bay sliding window with rubber seal, and

-  one bay sliding window with SLIDING metal screen and with ruber seal.

I will be selling a pair Vanagon captain's chairs [charcoal grey motif]  and 
a set of three Vanagon captain's chairs [tan] at the show, all five in GREAT 
condition - no burns, tears, or wear.  Headrests, arm rests, plugs and side 
plastics all there.


And probably as much other big stuff as I can get in the '78.  [[BRAND NEW 
S&amp;S Headers muffler, mail ordered from S&amp;S Headers, cost me about $115, sell 
for whatever a Paceseter goes for...]]


Perhaps even a tow hitch for the '73-'79 that is collapsible for mailing, 
and storage and transit.  It bolts under the rear bumper arms, and could 
semi-permanently attach along with the bumper, or just slap it on when 
needed, in place of the bumper.  Comes apart in 5-6 pieces. Heavy as one 
piece, but not bad when taken apart.

Anybody else going ??
