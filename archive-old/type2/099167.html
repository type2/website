Subject: new rings question

Last night I was checking the gap of my rings in the cylinders to make
sure that they have the correct tolerances and all of them check out
except for the top ring for all 4 cylinders; the top one doesn't have
the recommended gap (it's too tight).  Do I file it down to open the
gap?

thanks,
Mike
