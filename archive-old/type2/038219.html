&gt;OK, here is the scenario:
&gt;
&gt;I purchased a 71 Westy that had been sitting for 10 years for $500.  
I have no vacuum leaks that I know of (I tested this by simply
&gt;blocking off the vacuum holes with rubber boots and it made no difference).

Not a valid test to eliminate flange leaks and such other possibles. See
the following for Vakuum Schlucking finding ideas.

&gt;It seems to run just fine but will not idle.  Any input will be appreciated.

And you only rebuilt the carb twice. Such is the nature of a bit of
undisolvable crud in the idle circuit. Did you blow out all passages with
60 psi? Sometimes that will not get it. Rule out Vacuum Schlucking. If that
ist gut, replace the carb.  

&gt;Thanks.  I am new to the VW thing.  I was a fuel injection guy....

As a Systems Engineer, you will certainly see wonderful applications of
systems design in all things Bosch, and if you do not have it, pick up a
copy of the Bosch Systems Handbook. The value of the electrical symbols and
terminals definitions are worth the price to me. The section on engine
harmonics is great. Black box/feedback theory. Truly an engineers
reference, but good info and data for anyone wanting to understand more,
and why the Germans design systems the way they do, via the DM, for
definition see above given reference to the archive.
