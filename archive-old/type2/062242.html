Subject: Leaving key on long time

That was the best subject heading I could come up with for this 
problem.  Last night I had to move my bus a few feet down a hill so I 
got in and turned the key enough to unlock the wheel and backed it 
down the street.  When I returned about an hour later the key was 
still in the on position.  Doh!  Now, I have heard that doing this 
will fry your points but I don't have any.  I have a Compufire points 
replacement module and a Bosch blue coil.  The coil was very hot to 
the touch.  The bus started first turn of the key, like always, and 
ran fine on the seven mile trip home.  '71 1600DP, stock electricals 
with the above mentioned exception.

My question then is:  Did I dramatically shorten the life of one of 
both of these pieces of electrical equipement?  Anything else?

Thanks, Jim
