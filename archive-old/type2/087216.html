Subject: Re: [T2] A-Arm Bushing Replacement???

Dave,

Did this on a 79 bug bushing when I replaced them with urethane.

Did it under the car without taking everything off.
Used a &quot;large&quot; screwdriver, some fancy language, and serious grunting on 
my part&lt;grin&gt;.  Wups, almost forgot that I got them started with a C clamp 
and just the right sized socket.....

Not sure on a bus as they are larger.
Try anything you have from a vise to a large c clamp before carting off to 
someone with a press.

Cheers, dave

&gt; I done it again, not explaining myself.  I mean the Rear A-Arm bushing.  The
&gt; round one that the bolt goes through to bolt it to the frame.  I'm doing an
&gt; IRS Conversion on a SplitWindow and the one Bushing, from the 69 Arm,just
&gt; seems a bit worn. I'm hoping it's the Bushing and not the Arm that's causing
&gt; the problem.  I bought the only 68-70 Rear A-Arms around my local area that
&gt; were reasonable?  Anyone have an extra left side one they'd sale?

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Has anyone replaced the A-Arm bushing before?  I assume they press in?
&gt; &gt; &gt;I'm looking for a way to get the old out and the new ones in without
&gt; &gt; &gt;having to take them to a shop to be pressed out and new in.
&gt; &gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Dave,
&gt; &gt; I take it you mean the front beam/control arm bushings?  Are these things
&gt; &gt; even available anymore?  I thought I saw a note on a retailers' site that
&gt; &gt; they were NLA.  If you find a source for them, please let us all know.
&gt; &gt; Thanks.
