Remember, type 2 list members get 10% off if you specify that!


I assure you all, we are on the leading edge of products avialable. If you

Just because you can't find it doesn't mean we don't have it. There's only
one guy (that's me) entering parts and descriptions in our database, and
it's slow going.
