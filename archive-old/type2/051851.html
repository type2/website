&gt;      OK, We put a afm off of a 78, and 79 bus on and still not running,
&gt; we put different relays, computer brain,  coil, distributor, points and
&gt; condenser, checked all wiring connections, fuel pump _at_ 35psi, and spark
&gt; plugs. nothing works. It still won't run.

I noticed in all the replies no one suggested to check the 3 ground wires on
2 terminals that plug onto the ground point under the left rear of the
plenum, attached to a case bolt.

Also, coming down the harness from the ECU area is a single white wire. This
is the trigger signal for the injectors. Make sure it is connected to the 1
[ - ] terminal on the coil. [the same one the green dist. lead goes to]
