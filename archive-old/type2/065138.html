Subject: Engine Tin Screw Sizes

The screw/bolts are 6mm x 1mm.  Get a tap and gently tap out the 
holes and welded on nuts with it.  Get a variety of lengths of bolts 
at the local hardware store.  I finally got po'd enough a not having 
enough of the right bolts around that I spent $20 just on bolts, 
washers and nuts, and another $4 on a tap.  Most of what you need 
will be around 3/4 inch long (19mm).

&gt; What size are the screws that hold the bottom engine tin?
