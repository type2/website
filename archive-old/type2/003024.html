Subject: [T2] New to list / help with windshield wipers


&gt; Hi-
&gt;   I recently bought a 68 Westy.  This is my first bus, so I've been
learning
&gt; a lot
&gt; by just lurking in the background and reading everything on the list.
&gt; Anyway,
&gt; my current problem is a lack of wiper arms for my bus.  I have the motor,
&gt; linkage, etc, but no arms.  I've looked around online and at a couple
stores
&gt; and have been unable to find replacement arms.  I've been told they are
&gt; next to impossible to find.  Any suggestions out there?  Can I mount arms
&gt; from a different year bus (or any other car) to my wiper shafts?  Will I
&gt; need to
&gt; convert the entire assembly to another model year?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for any help,
&gt; Brad Baker
&gt;
