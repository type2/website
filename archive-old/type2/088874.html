Subject: RE: [T2] drive your bus daily?

I can speak from experience when I say that Freds garage does what they
say.  If its simple, great.  But if it cant be done on a Sat..they will
tell you so.  I used to live in Redwood City and grew up there my self
and if there was someone I would take my bus to, they are top of the
list.  Another good one is Gregs VW in redwood city but they don't work
on late model busses, but he will try to help you out as much as he can.


Oh, my bus is a daily driver too.  And its my only vehicle so it to
&quot;has&quot; to run.  But, as we all know by my postings...it does not like to
do that regularly.  Its still dead by the way.  Wont fire.

&gt; So, do you drive your bus every day? I do. Its a camper, which I guess
is 

yup, my 78 is my daily driver, and only vehicle, so it has got to run.



&gt; Time to call Freds in Redwood city to see if they can get me in
instead, 
&gt; even if it is another 20 minutes out of the way.

what makes you think they will treat you any better???
