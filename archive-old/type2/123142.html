&gt; Has anyone replaced their 'off side' passenger - right side battery tray in 
&gt; a '72.  If yes, what did you use for a replacement, the bus depot / bus boys 
&gt; battery tray [Battery Tray (Pass Side) 68-72 Bus] or the Just Kampers 
&gt; battery tray [T2 Battery tray 7/71 &gt; 5/79 offside ]
&gt; 
&gt; The battery tray I got from  bus depot  have seems to be at least two inches 
&gt; too wide for my '72.
&gt; 
&gt; Hopefully the '72 battery tray is not a 'one year' items

I just used sheet steel.  and cut it out to fit
