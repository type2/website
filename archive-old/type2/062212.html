Subject: Detonation/Pre-ignition &amp; Pitted Surfaces

consider the &quot;pinging&quot; or &quot;rattling&quot; noise in an engine to be caused by 
either pre-ignition or detonation along with too far advanced spark.
Most of the stock engines at that time were iron, not aluminum and 
didn't get pitted from &quot;octane knock&quot;.
 
   As I recall, both pre-ignition and detonation were caused by lower 
than desired octane rating of the fuel combined with heavy load on the 
engine.  My memory tells me that pre-ignition was exacerbated by the 
accumulation of large particles of hot carbon that would cause the fuel 
to ignite BEFORE the spark occured, very early on the up-stroke. 'Tough 
on the bearings just like too much advance.  

   On the other hand,  I think detonation happened on the down stroke 
after ignition.  Too low octane rating of the fuel, lean mixture and a 
very heavy load caused the fuel to EXPLODE after ignition rather than 
burn in a controlled manner.  Again, really tough on the bearings.

    I don't recall seeing after market aluminum cylinder heads getting 
pitted mostly because we always ran a really rich mixture with the high 
compression heads.

   Discussion anyone?
