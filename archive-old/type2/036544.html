Subject: Idiot Q: 009 rotor/cap interchange?

List,
A few questions that did not appear to be specifically addressed in the
archives:

1.  Is the alleged #3 timing ritard in 009 distributors a function of the cap
&amp; rotor or is it the way the lobes on the shaft are cut? How do they do that?

2. Can i use the rev-limiting rotor off the vac advance dizzy from this
salvaged 73 1700 bus engine on a std Bosch 009?  Howabout the cap- should i
use it?

I am going to go through this vac dist and use it eventually, but i am sure
about the condition of the 009, so will use it for break-in and want to use
the rev limiter with it.


TIA,
clark
