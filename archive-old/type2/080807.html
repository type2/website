Well, it is not roses and camp stools out here!
We have to deal with....
Being able to get to pristine nature- can arrive nowhere with in an hour,
discounts from 40+ (age)  air-cooled mechs who have original single cabs as
their daily drivers and will only warranty work on air-cooled cause they
know it will stand...
not much rust as the Pacific Ocean is the mother of  all VW's and does not
send her paternal cancer to her kids,  here they don't salt the roads but
leave you to your own choices of ro drive with studded tires or take the MAX
( &amp; the only state that has legalized by choice euthanasia)
Parts galore via internet
And I can sit here at Crater lake and post while enjoying 8 friends and four
other 70's era Westy's
And being on the West coast can post messages after everyone else has gone
to bed...

Allow me/us ... a Friday post liberty as it is still Friday here..

&gt; After 6 inches of snow on April 20th and a about a foot or so on April
&gt; Fool's Day I was just thinking about moving to the Carolinas.
&gt; The grass on the other side of the hill would be green at least.
&gt; Minnesota, the buses are rusty and the weather's lousy!
