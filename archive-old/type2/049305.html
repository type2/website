Alot of states that i know, do not require a Title for cars over 25 yrs 
old. Including my state (Georgia). They claim this will reduce the 
paper work. All you need is a registration at the DMV. If you wanna 
be safe, have it notarize with the seller signature in the back of the 
registration. Best thing to do is call up your local DMV and ask 
what is required.
