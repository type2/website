Yep,

I'll &quot;third&quot; that motion. Same thing happened to me. I adjusted it 3
times in two weeks!! I also kept hearing a &quot;doiiing&quot; noise (kind of
like a guitar string breaking, but deeper) after using the clutch.
Finally checked the cable, only 2 strands left!!!

&gt; &gt;I would suggest taking a look at your cablle up near the pedal
assembly,
&gt; &gt;and seeing if it is frayed, and about to break the rest of the way.:)
&gt; 
&gt; I agree - this definitely sounds like a frayed cable, about to break!
&gt; I had the same problem once - it was frayed in the middle though, so
no
&gt; visual clues (just the continual adjusting required). I actually had
to
&gt; snap/cut the cable, and with draw the 2 pieces from either end.
