Subject: Re: [T2] Acceptable speeds



I would have to agree.  I have checked the accuracy of my vehicle by having 
my wife 'pace me' in our Passat.  My speedo, while old, seems to be quite 
accurate(above 10 or 15 MPH).

&gt;
&gt;Another factor is the accuracy of your speedo and we all know that VW
&gt;speedometers tend to be optomistic as they age.
&gt;
&gt;My 58MPH figure is actual MPH.  It's more like 70 on the speedo.
