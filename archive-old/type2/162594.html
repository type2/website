&gt; I need to replace the muffler on the 78' westy. I got a

&gt; line up very well and I had to tweak my heat exchangers and elbows to
&gt; get it together and even then it was not a great fit and not that quiet.
&gt; Not looking to bash BD here I think I may have just gotten a bad unit

well since none of these dealers actually make the mufflers can't blame
them.  I don't think I've gotten a muffler that has actually &quot;fit&quot; without
hassles since the one that came on the bus...  seems a sawzall and welder
is required to get a decent fit

&gt; and well its been on there a year now so I hardly have room to bitch. I
&gt; would like a quiet exhaust that is decent quality and as free flow as
&gt; possible. I have considered converting to the 72-74 style but did not

which is what I did last time.

&gt; really relish the expense of new heat exchangers. Also my current
&gt; exchangers and elbows are in pretty good shape. I would like to get a
&gt; new muffler like the one from BD above but am looking for a better and

maybe find someone who has the older style that is willing to swap??

&gt; quieter one, maybe a quietpack or monza style, but not one thats gonna
&gt; rust out in a week. Any thoughts?

I got one of the SS mufflers that BD was selling a few years back and the
good news/bad news about that muffler.  the good news is that it still
looks like new and has not degraded any significant amount.

the bad news.  the tailpipe flange was welded on wrong and had to cut the
tailpipe near the flange rotate it about 45degrees and reweld it, and all
the mounting brackets and flanges are mild steel and have rusted pretty
badly would never get it apart would have to cut it off.

all in all it has been a good buy but could have been much bettter for an
extra $10 and a little care.
