&gt; sure. here's what I did. Went to home depot &amp; got 2 brass shut off

&gt; valve to the fuel line. Clamped it &amp; have been very happy since. I put
&gt; them both just out of the fuel tank. It is quite tight up there to
&gt; shut them off, but it's not exactly something I do every week. If I
&gt; can, I'll see if I can put take some pics &amp; then post them. But
&gt; essentially it was something like &lt;$20 in parts for the whole setup. I
&gt; thought about using gas valves because of the much more compact handle
&gt; but couldn't find a size that I was happy with.

In the dark times when the gas tank was the bane on my existence, I had one
of these valves installed between the tank and the filter.  When I
ressurrected my bus a couple of months ago I remove the valve because no
fuel was coming out and I noticed that the seal has disintegrated.

You can find shut off valves specifically made for fuel.  I will put one on
the next time I have to change the filter.
