Subject: Re: [T2] How to Read Dipstick (for Compleat Idiot)?

Phil,

Back in the days that I worked at a &quot;service&quot; station when the &quot;attendant&quot; 
did all of that for you, here is how it worked.

Grip handle, pull stick out while at the same time holding your &quot;red rag&quot; 
around it tightly down as you pulled it out.  

Reinsert, wait  1/2 second and pull and read.


Always read VW's with flat side down cause you are at an angle...you will 
get false reading with the flat side up.

Cheers, dave

&gt; This question is almost too stupid to ask...but ow do you read your

&gt; 
&gt; BUT, if I take a reading with the flat edge of the stick facing up (you 
&gt; know) I don't seem to get the same reading as with the stick facing 
&gt; down. Maybe as much as a pint's difference.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know which is the most correct reading, up or down...or am 
&gt; I just imagining that there's a difference?
