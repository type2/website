Actually, if the stuff contains PTFE, it can cause
*more* damage than regular oil!!...keep reading...


&gt;    I read somewhere that TUFOIL has data that showed
&gt; a doubling of the
&gt; life of forklift engines, a more &quot;controlled&quot; engine
&gt; application.  It
&gt; contains molybdenum as well as PTFE- holds the
&gt; Guinness book record for
&gt; &quot;slipperest stuff on earth&quot;.  I don't know if they
&gt; have it for trannies,
&gt; but believe they are on the web under TUFOIL_dot_com.

Sure, but *who* did/paid for the testing? Tufoil?
Well, the tobacco industry did/paid for their own
testing, too and guess what? Cigarettes really *don't*
cause cancer!!! (good news for me!).

There's a lot of good, unbiased info on the web about
oil-additives, and I have yet to find any that
indicates *anything* positive about them :-(

Try the following URL:
http://www.vtr_dot_org/maintain/oil-additives.html
for lengthy, but *very* informative info on additives.
I urge you all to read it before putting this stuff in
your motors...especially if you don't have an oil
filter! 

For those who don't want to read the entire article,
here are a few good quotes from some respected, and
*accredited* institutions:

     Avco Lycoming, a major manufacturer of aircraft
engines, states, &quot;We have tried every additive we
could find on the
     market, and they are all worthless.&quot; 

     Briggs and Stratton, renowned builders of some of
the most durable engines in the world, says in their
report on engine
     oil additives, &quot;They do not appear to offer any
benefits.&quot; 

     North Dakota State University conducted tests on
oil additives and said in their report, &quot;The theory
sounds good- the
     only problem is that the products simply don't
work.&quot; 

     And finally, Ed Hackett, chemist at the
University of Nevada Desert Research Center, says,
&quot;Oil additives should not
     be used. The oil companies have gone to great
lengths to develop an additive pack age that meets the
vehicle's
     requirements. If you add anything to this oil you
may upset the balance and prevent the oil from
performing to
     specification.&quot; 

By the way, this article was labeled &quot;Snake-Oil&quot;,
which is what I believe additives to be.
