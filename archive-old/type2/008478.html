Subject: foam seal needed

Hello. I finally got my bus running, but I need a new seal. I hear a 
vacuum leak and am wondering (but I doubt it) if it could be the bad 
foam seal I have. Any thoughts welcome.

I was driving my bus for the first time in 4 months yesterday and 
realized why I had spent all those nights in the rain working on it.
Its good to not have to drive my gas guzzling Chevy truck. Can't take a 
nap in that very easily.


Thanks,
           Simon
