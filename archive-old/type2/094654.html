Paul,

I think he is talking about lengthening the wires that connect the gauge
to the thermocouple wires. From how you responded, im going to take a
guess that you havent seen a VDO head temp gauge. If I am wrong about
this please correct me though. The VDO sensor I have has ~1 foot of
thermocouple wire that has a ring on one end that goes around the
sparkplug base, on the other end is a molex plug that from there
connects to two regular old wires that run to the front to the gauge.
The only thing I could see that would go wrong with lengthening the
regular old wires would be the increased resistance, but I don't think
that it would be large enough to make much of a difference.

Jonathan

actually lengthening the head temp gage's wires with anything but the
proper thermocouple wire will make it worthless most likely as it
derives the temperature from the cold junction of 2 different metals,
copper/constantine (red/blue type T) being the most common in my line of
work.  not a big deal though, go to a geek store and get as much of the
proper thermocouple wire that you need and twist the wires together then
solder them and shrink wrap over them.
