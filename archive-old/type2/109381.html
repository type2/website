Subject: Kombi oil and Cyl head temperature

Just thought I'd pass on some test info for you all to ponder.
Sorry about the metric numbers.

Kombi Cooling Test Results.
First things first. Andy is a '77 dual carb 2L motor + GB, all stock with
mineral oil in engine and GB. Another point worth noting is I have 215/75R15
tyres on, so the engine runs a little slower than normal ~9%.
It has ALL tinware and an operational thermostat. It's getting a little
tired now, ~118psi compression on all cylinders, and is in need of new
bearings. It also runs a little rich at the moment.
I have all VDO gauges less than 6 months old.

So, onto the test. Ambient temp 14degC for morning start up.
Idle time 5 min, by which time Cylinder head temp is at 65degC, oil temp
doesn't register (it starts at 50degC)
Drive 5min. through suburban streets, CHT up to 90, oil still doesn't
register.
Onto the highway at 80km/hr for 5 min. CHT up to 120, oil just over 50.
Speed up to 100km/hr for a further 5 min. CHT has reached steady state at
135. Oil up to 80. It takes just over 10 min. more for the oil to reach a
steady state of 100degC.
I then open the engine hatch and run for a further 15min at 100km/hr. NO
CHANGE. CHT remains at 135, oil at 100.

Afternoon run. Ambient temp 24degC.
Idle time 1 min, by which time Cylinder head temp doesn't register 40degC
minimum on gauge, oil temp doesn't register.
Drive 5min. through suburban streets, CHT up to 85, oil still doesn't
register.
Onto the highway at 80km/hr for 5 min. CHT up to 120, oil ~60.
Speed up to 100km/hr for a further 5 min. CHT has reached steady state at
135. Oil up to 90. It takes just over 10 min. more for the oil to reach a
steady state of 105degC.
I then open the engine hatch and run for a further 20min at 100km/hr. NO
CHANGE. CHT remains at 135, oil at 105.

So, there you have it. Opening the rear hatch made no difference for my
test.
I will add results without the thermostat connected when time permits.

Just a few further observations regarding cooling.
When I come off the highway and back to suburban streets, the CHT quickly
drops to 120. The oil only drops ~5deg VERY slowly.
CHT varies fairly quickly with load (ie foot to the floor driving, vacuum
gauge at zero increases temp). Oil varies slow with RPM, higher RPM
increases temp.
On a recent trip to Adelaide and through the Flinders, with daily temps up
to 45deg. The CHT occasionally reached 180, but backing off kept it below
that. I struggled with oil temps up to and just over 130. The only way to
keep it down was to take a break every 20 min or so. Consequently I did two
oil changes on the 6000km trip.
