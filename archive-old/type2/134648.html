Maybe http://www.justkampers_dot_com/ will work better. They're in the UK.

Subject: [T2] Rubber seals


&gt; Hello everyone...
&gt; Greetings from Portugal
&gt;
&gt; I need to get new rubber seals for almost all windows of my '68 bus. I'm
&gt; planning in get some from Clip1_dot_com (german seals) but maybe this doesn't 
&gt; make
&gt; sense, since i'm from Portugal.
&gt; Does anyone knows about a online store in Europe where i can get them and
&gt; other spareparts?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance
&gt;
&gt; Joao Ribeiro
