&gt;Apparently the #1 exhaust valve
&gt;guide failed and entered the cylinder

Where did the VALVE ( spring, keepers, etc.) GO ?
You have left out a critical piece of information.

&gt;As for the head, the valve area of the head looks
&gt;OK, the pounded valve guide material was beaten into the
&gt;lower surface, not apparently into the valves.  Think this
&gt;could be fixed?  Is my piston salvagable?

Oversize valve guides are available.
Take both heads to a vw machinist.
Destroyed pistons make good ashtrays.

&gt;Does this mean that the entire engine (78 2.0 FI) needs to be rebuilt?

No. But you previously stated you had found metal
and a lot of sludge in the strainer, and that will require
case disassembly and inspection of bearings. So, Yes.

&gt;Another option is, I have a complete 1700 w/single Weber
&gt;with a purported broken crank, and another 1700 used longblock
&gt;(worked when last ran, no rings.)  I think I could take these
&gt;2 engines and make 1 pretty cheaply, maybe that will last me
&gt;until I can afford the AVP.

Disassemble both cores and inventory good components.
Then price additional parts and survey your capabilities.
Do you really want to know how to build an engine ?
