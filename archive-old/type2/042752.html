Subject: re: hot start problem

I think all 34 PCIT carbs have this problem.
Long ago I was working at a VW dealership and a team of Solex engineers came
to town to research this problem.  I guess it gets a lot hotter in Texas
than it does in Germany.
They decided that the fuel trapped in the accelerator pump circuit was
heating up and expanding after the engine was shut off.  This caused the
fuel to trickle out the accelerator pump nozzle and flood the engine.
Their cure was to drill a tiny, (.022 in), hole between the float bowl and
the accelerator pump diaphragm cavity.  This let the pressure bleed back
into the float bowl instead of flooding the engine.  I tried it and it
works!  I guess the hole is small enough that it has little effect in the
acc pump output.
Try it, it might help and it won't hurt.
