If this is the place in southern Oregon, stay away. I had one knock on 
initial startup. Oil looked very grey, my conclusion being the assembler 
used LOTS of assembly lube and packed the bearing holes. The oil pressure 
can't push the grease out and you have a starved bearing from the get go. 
If this is not the southern Oregon source, still, beware of compromise in 
all potential sources.

If this is the same supplier, the price will be among the lowest full page 
ad charlatans. If the cost of the motor is less than twice the average 
magazine price, you are buying compromise, overhauled junk. In my opinion, 
the AVP price simply does not allow enough to include new German 
bearings/pistons/cylinders/oil pump/etc, much less the cost of the kind of 
skilled labor required for proper checks and assembly. It takes more time 
to do it right than it does to pretend to do it right. It requires less 
time to keep it cheap and even that must be compromised by cheaper parts to 
compete with the low bucks suppliers.  Double their price for the real 
deal, and expect three times the serviceable life when properly installed, 
maintained and operated.

Try NW ConRod in South Seattle. They will give you a motor that will meet 
or exceed a factory assembly as to quality and longevity given reasonable 
maintenance and operation. This will cost real money for real results from 
highly skilled machine and assembly procedures with new or remanufacture 
German parts. They are a small shop of 5 or so very highly experienced 
journeyman VW engine craftsmen.
