Subject: 77 Westi Misc Parts Wanted

Hi All,

I am looking for a few odds and ends to complete the interior of my
camper.  I know it is almost time to put her away but I can't help still
wanting to work on her.
I am looking for the drain valve and hose for the water tank as well as
the two rubber bumpers that hold the tank in place.  I also need the
metal latch assembly that holds the rear bench seat closed.

Thanks,

Peter
