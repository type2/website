Subject: Re: ultimate breadloaf vision (longish, nerdish)

So Schwarzmeister says:
&gt; Breadloaves:
&gt; While not as cool as splitties, are still *much* cooler than Vanagons.  A
&gt; Vanagon will never evoke the feelings of nostalgia that a loaf shares
&gt; somewhat with a splittie.

Hack!...Cough...Spfff!....Harrr! (The sleeping oger awakes and perks his
ears....) Loafs are ~muck~ cooler than vanagons?  (snort)  I'll take that
flame bait.  (munch!)  Let's see David.  It's going to be 107 today..... 
Ya wanna take a drive with me (in our respective vans) in the afternoon?  
Oh!?!  You meant asthetically...  :)  Well from a nostalgic point of 
view, the look of the loafer is remembered lovingly for the years it
represented.  But the splitty far surpasses the nostalgic marker than
the loafer.  It's got a style that more people can relate to than any
other.  It's just sooooo cool.....   It's like the bug.  Everyone knows
what they're about and has a story about it.  The same is true about
the loafs, but the splitties have a tad more character.  Not that I
don't like loafs.  Had one myself.....  I was proud of it too.  Now
the vanagon.... well, it's just butt ugly....  The first time a saw
one, I thought &quot;What the hell is that?&quot;  &quot;What was VW thinking?&quot;....
I never intended to get one either, but the wife was afraid of doing
any long adventures in the '74 and offered me a chance to buy a new
Vanagon camper.  Now, I may be crazy, but I ain't REAL dumb (Cowboy
Movie - David Crosby).  I was not going to turn down a chance like
that.  Keep in mind that before we bought the '91 camper, I looked
around quite a bit to really make sure that it was the right vehicle
for my needs.  I even looked at (Heaven forbid) some 'merican vans.
I mean full-sized ones.  I didn't EVEN consider the POS minivans.
But the full sized ones didn't have much utility and most looked
like whore-houses inside because of the decor.

So I finally located the '91 and man, I tell you.  I'm sooo glad
I bought it.  It really is a nice van.  I've had only a few minor
problems with the AC and a idle stabilizer.  The rest has been
sweet.  And after driving it, it's character really grows on you.
I know this is true because I never liked bugs either until I 
was an owner of one.  They're like stray dogs that just need love
and attention.

Mine may not be best of show, but I certainly wouldn't trade it
or one of my wheels for 'Da Boat' (Ouch!).  But.......  That
doesn't mean that I don't appreciate your van.  It has a charm
all it's own and were I in the right place at the right time,
I probably would've purchased it too.  But I'm glad it's in your
loving hands David.  Because I know you'll take good care of it.
And you're proud of it (as you should be).  So what the hell am
I saying here anyway.  Well.... I likes my van and you like
yours.  So Nyah!   ;p   ;)
