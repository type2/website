Subject: 35 prong plug for ECU? Doesn't match Muir's on Pg. 141

I have searched the archive and library and I think I may just not have
the write search phrase or something. I'm sure theirs lots of info on
this. In the Muir's book (How to keep your VW alive, 25th ann. ed.) on
page 141 it shows a really cool little diagram of the ECU harness and
where it all goes and stuff. But mine has 35 prongs, NOT the 25 shown in
the book. 
 
So is their another diagram like the one in the book somewhere but for
35 prong ECU connectors? Or are you just not supposed to count some of
the empty holes or what? If ya'll could just tell me what the propper
name for my setup is, I can probably find it in the archives mayhaps. 
 
It's a early year 1976 Fuel Injected (of course), manual tranny, 2.0L
Kombi.
