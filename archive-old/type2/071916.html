&gt;Has anyone ever really understood the effectiveness of the &quot;intake air
&gt;preheating hose &quot; which goes through the tin and sucks dusty, cruddy air from
&gt;below the engine compartment, right where the back wheels kick up all the
&gt;dirt.


.....I have had my 2L 82 for three years and I run it with no air intake
hose and the thermostat wire is disconnected. This is the way the PO used
it so I have carried on with this set up. So far so good. If I am doing
harm will someone please let me know.
