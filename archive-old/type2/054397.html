Try looking at the connection between your cold start injector and your
battery. I had a similar problem due to a broken connection with preciuos
mentioned wire at the starter. If it runs fine(starts, I mean) after it has
warm up then that's your problem. Also have your thermo-time switch and cold
start injector tested.  Good luck.
