Subject: Re: [T2] smokey the hot-air vent

Hi Anton,

The same thing happened to me in my '70 bus, and though I don't know about
your engine, I'll tell you my experience.  The first time I got the bus out on
the open road after the leak, my bus filled with smoke.  I pulled to the side
and ran around to the back with a fire extinguisher.  When I figured out the
bus was not actually on fire but was pumping oil smoke, I got back in the bus
and continued the trip.  I had trouble with visibility for a while, but after
an hour or so the smoke eventually burned off and went away.  You might give
it a try.  It'd be nice to pick a day without rain, which might be
problemmatic in this wet October we're having in the Van-Vic area.  Next
June?

Good luck.

See you on the road,
Jerry
