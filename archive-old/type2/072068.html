Subject: Pushrod Gone
Date: Sun, 13 May 2001 22:24:31 -0400 (EDT)

List-
Driving home Friday evening going about 60mph, rattling sound from the
engine, loud backfire, sudden loss of power, red lights, off the road,
flatbed home.
I removed the valve covers first start looking and found that the pushrod
for the exhaust valve on #1 cylinder seems to be gone. Rocker arm can move
freely since there is no pushrod to stop it. Where did it go?
Let me see...exhaust valve not opening after power stroke, piston comes
back up.... great way to blow a hole in a piston. I don't have a
compression guage but intend to get one real soon.
Any ideas as to what happened. Engine ran fine up til then. Type 4, 1.7L.

Thanks,
