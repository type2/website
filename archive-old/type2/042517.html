Subject: Fuel pump Question

I am putting an alternator on an upright engine and using the Bocar, hecho
en Mexico, fuel pump.
Are the 2 pump nipples reversed?
On the old pump, the inlet line screwed in the lower section. Is the lower
section on the new pump the inlet side?
I seem to remember a post a few years back that said you needed to invert
the hoses, but I couldn't find it in the archives.
