Subject: Gas tank pad

Hey all--

Anyone know what type of material is suitable to use under the gas tank when
it is replaced?  VW doesn't even show it on their microfiche and I havent
seen it in any of the other catalogs.  One marine store said they have
carried it, but couldn't find it in any of their supplier catalogs.  Any
ideas?
