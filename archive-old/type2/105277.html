Subject: Re: [T2] Hard BRAKES!!

New van for you?
Never driven it before?
Check your vacuum booster.
Is it connected?
Is the one way vac. valve installed correctly with direction of flow towards 
the engine?
Follow the procedure in the archive for brake adjustment which includes 
adjusting your hand brake which makes a world of difference in your braking 
confidence.
Good luck,
Rusty
