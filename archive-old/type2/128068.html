&gt;&gt;While we're on the subject of paint, it would be
 nice to hear from people who have painted their buses
themselves&lt;&lt;

Ok, if you insist. The first time I ever had a bus
painted, I went to Maaco.  It was my first bus, I was
broke, etc.  They painted just the bottom half up to
the belt line. The &quot;Ambassador Service&quot; paint job cost
me about $325 plus tax. It took nearly a whole 3
months for the new paint to start coming off in huge
chunks!
Fast forward a few years. I pick up an EXCELLENT 71
Westy for a song, butt-ugly paint, white with this big
baby blue &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot; type stripe on both sides.
That has to go. So I check around local body shops for
paint prices (NOT Maaco!) and most are telling me that
paint jobs start at $1500, too rich for my blood. OK,
what the hell, I'll paint it myself! I already have
the compressor. I spend $75 on a mediocre quality
paint gun, and the local Auto shop sells single stage
(No clear coat) auto paint for about $75 a gallon
(price includes hardener).  I buy about 10 cans of
Rustoleum automobile primer from &quot;BLowes&quot; So right off
the bat, I'm at about $180.  I really just want to get
rid of that ugly stripe and have some temporary rust
protection until I can really drive the bus for a
while to see if it's the one I'll keep before I pump
1500 beans into a new paint job.  I figure I should be
able to get a year out of it anyway.  Well that was
three years ago and the paint job still looks pretty
good, far from perfect, but still pretty good (IMHO).
I have painted about 5 other VW's in the mean time
with the same method.  
Heres are the things that I have learned: 1) Sand and
prime first. You don't have to go down to bare metal,
but you need to rough up the surface for good
adhesion.  2)You can paint a bus with gun, compressor,
and auto enamel for nearly as cheap as you can
rattle-can spray it.  3) Practice painting on extra
body panels laying around before you shoot it on your
ride.  4) You don't need a giant air compressor, my
2.5 HP 8 gallon compressor did just fine.  5)In the
Midwest, it is best to paint the bus BEFORE April or
AFTER September because all the flying insects are not
present at those times!  6)DON'T BE AFRAID, the worst
that could happen is that you screw up and have to
re-sand it and do it again. Thats a PITA, but not the
end of the world!  and Finally: 7)Its a LOT easier to
sell an Old VW that has a decent looking paint job
than an ugly faded one, even if the mechanicals are
the same.
For my next paint job, I am going to try to do an even
BETTER jon by investing in a higher quality gravity
feed spray gun and try to do a 2 stage paint, with
clear coat step.

the implements of destruction and we headed on to the
