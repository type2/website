&gt; Heh...

&gt; I'm not now, nor have I ever been into big SUVs. Although, I would love
&gt; to have a 1965 Toyota Land Cruiser (for those who don't know, is
&gt; basically a Jeep.... ).  There are several reasons why people buy huge
&gt; large SUVs.... I mean, I'm no expert, and no one says my opinions or
&gt; views are the correct ones... they could be totally wrong.

I first got a VW bus for the same reason I still have one. the only
vehicle that does what I want.  It's a big enough empty box that it will
hold all my junk but not a huge truck..and it is easy enough to work on
that I can still manage to stay away from the $$$ machines at the
dealership..

&gt; For &quot;logical&quot; reasons... it seems that many people buy them now because
&gt; they are safer. Since everyone else has one now, everyone else also has
&gt; to have one.

I know one person who has a Hummer 1 that really needs it, he manages a
ski slope and needs to haul junk up the mountain in the snow to keep the
lifts working, not to mention getting to work in the blizzard... but for
the rest of us...

&gt; Anyway... yeah, I'm not really big on SUV's either... heheh.

and FWIW, the hummer2 is merely a Cadilac Escalade !

&gt; and, the Speedos REALLY do have to go...

wait a minute as a serious swimmer they really do have a function.  of
course you won't catch me dead wearing them on the boardwalk or in public
away from the pool....

like a VW bus form does follow function,

Bob
