Mike,
While I haven't experienced these symptoms in my 75 FI, I'll conjecture:
1. The quick open-throttle dying sounds like you may have a transient leak 
in an air hoses between the AFM and the throttle housing, which opens up 
under high vacuum condition, but not when throttle is opened slowly. Look 
for a small crack or loose fitting.
2. The wandering timing sounds like the retard vacuum line running from the 
throttle housing to the distributor is also intermittantly open or plugged 
or leaking. Both vacuum lines should be checked, and you would do well to 
clean out the inlet nipples for them at the throttle housing using a fine 
wire. Better even would be to remove the throttle housing and clean it; use 
a new gasket when re-installing.
By the way, the first year of FI in the U.S. was the '75 model year.
