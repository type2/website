&gt; dear list,  I am currently trying to get my '79 westfalia up and running.

SO my question is if not the oil cooler seals, the dipstick &quot;booty&quot;, or
&gt; the oil cooler (we watched it as we ran the engine NO leak visible), what
&gt; could be causing a leak at the back end of the engine?  This is a recent and
&gt; sudden development.  No leaks or OIL anywhere prior to this
&gt; development......HHHMMMMMM          thanks tom

The only other source could be the crankshaft seal. Sitting unused for a period can distort an old hard seal.
