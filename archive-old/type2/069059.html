Subject: Plastic coathanger avail pre-73

*Im guessing at the pre-73 thing~ I dont know...

Just picked up the plastic coathanger pieces that mount into the '67 Westy
just behind the driver and passanger's heads. Part number 255-857-629-581 is
still available through the VWOA dealer system. Each side has a two piece
config to make &quot;the coathanger.&quot; Specifically this is the white plastic
trumpet shaped item not the aluminum coat &quot;hook&quot; that is typically in the
Westy closets etc.
The cost was $1.88 each. They were speccial order and didnt take long to
arrive at the dealer. I ordered four~ two for the RFH and two for the stash.

It's a nickle and dime part but I always pass along info as it filters
through my brain. Good luck on your projects!
