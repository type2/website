Subject: Re: [T2] 72 Disc vs 73 up?????

The '72 brakes were also used in '71 making them a two year only part.  The 
spindles, calipers, and rotors are all different from the '73 to '79 parts.  
The rotors and calipers are larger than the '71-'72.

&gt; What's so different from the 72 Front disc brakes, and rear brakes also, 
that
&gt;  made them one year only thing?  Are at least the Spindles on a 72, and rear
&gt;  hub, the same as the 73 and up Bus?  I want disc on the front of my Split 
&gt; and
&gt;  found a deal on a 72 Bus, $100.  Don't want to use the 72 disc, but if the
&gt;  spindles are the same I'm going to buy it for the beam and rear hubs.  I 
&gt; have
&gt;  IRS on the back and someone is making me shock towers to use the 72 beam in
&gt;  the Split.
