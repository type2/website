Subject: AIRS NOTICE Western South Dakota

I just got a call from John Reynolds from MA.  He is driving a 87 water-cooled
vanagon and is having hesitation problems.  He thinks it may be &quot;vanagon
syndrome&quot;( I'm not familiar with this).  Right now he is in Belle Fourche SD,
and is going to get a motel for the night as the area is experiencing a winter
storm.  He's only about 8 miles from my house but unfortunately I am at work
and won't be home until friday a.m.  He has changed out the distrubutor and it
did improve but quickly worsened.  Its very wet here and he thinks that
exacerbates the problem  He's wondering what part or parts he may need to solve
the problem.  Any suggestions are appreciated and if someone could pass this on
to the Vanagon folks, I would appreciate it.  I do have a cell number for John
if anyone needs it.
