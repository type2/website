&gt; After a month off the list, i finally got signed back on. I took a trip to
&gt; Germany, saw very few aircooled Vw's. Most of the buses i saw were high
top
&gt; campers. Pretty neat, but i can almost see more aircooled at my house than
I
&gt; saw in all of Germany!
&gt;
Funny that you should say the above.  Over here in the U.K. and I hear the
same thing is happening in Germany, they're importing all the bugs and buses
they can from the states.  It's really funny when you see an add that says
imported from AZ, USA, or from Cali the prices is considerately higher.
Rust just kills em over here.
