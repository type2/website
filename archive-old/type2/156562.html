Subject: [T2] Bug Blocks Burn!

After BugRun 21 this last Saturday at Woodburn
Dragstrip, I went camping with my son and his friends.
 Most everyone had bugs and VW Busses with them.  I
went in my ASI/Riviera (T2).  Anyway, on Saturday
night, they burned an old 1600 bug-style engine block.
 Wow!  That was bright.  My `78 2.0 Litre motor was
said to be Aluminum.  Is it in reality a magnesium
alloy like the bug motor instead?
