Subject: CR for 1.8 l 

I was trying to get an engine together today,, and when I installed the
P&amp;C's , I found there was 2.5mm deck height.

I think this is too much, what do you think?
This leaves me with 6.8 CR and I was shooting for 7.3
Maybe I am calculating this wrong,, I added the 10cc piston dish to the
combustion chamber 54cc's for an effective combustion chamber volume of
64cc's

Does this mean I have to machine about 1.3mm OFF the barrels?
Bottom or Top?
These are new COFAP 022 198 075 ABR 93mm 1.8L

1.8 L. TypeIV engine
2.5mm deck height
10cc piston dish
54cc combustion chamber volume
93mm bore
69mm stroke
