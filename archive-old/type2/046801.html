Subject: [T2] stock 71 dizzy help.

I finally found a 71 vaccum advance dizzy (#0 231 167 055) for my 68 with a 
dual port motor, and a 34 pict3. Now to put it in. Am I correct in thinking 
that the timing is set according to the dizzy number and not the engine 
number? Meaning, I should set the timing to 5degrees ATDC using this dizzy 
instead of the numbers given for the engine it self? Also, where do the 
vaccum hoses come from/go to? I've got 3 possible places to plug them. the 
manifold just below the carb, the side of the carb pointing torward the 
dizzy, and then one more pointing out torward the gen. pully. The vaccum can 
it self has one on the front and back. Looking forward to getting rid of the 
009.
thanks
ronnie
