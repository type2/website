Subject: Please help me understand brake calipers

Hello,
Please help me understand brake calipers.

I ordered a right rebuilt brake caliper for 71-72 bus (part 211 615 108X) 
and here is what I received:

Core: 1973 and later (the larger one) as pictured on Fig 7-3 page 18, 
chapter 8 of Bentley.

Brake hose connection: would be on the upper part of the caliper with 
caliper installed on the right wheel. (Sounds right)

Pistons cutouts: both cutouts would be on the upper part of the pistons with 
caliper installed on the right wheel. (Sounds not right)

1)	Shouldn't the pistons cutouts be in the lower part of the pistons ?

2)	Assume I eventually got a correct 1973 and later right caliper. Is it OK 
to have a 1971 caliper on the left and a 1973 and later on the right ? My 
left caliper is doing working properly.

Thanks for your help

- Arnaud
