The 91 octane figure is arrived at using the &quot;Research&quot; method (RON). 
Your pump octane figure was arrived at by finding the &quot;Research&quot;
number and averaging it with the &quot;Motor&quot; number.  This &quot;R+M/2&quot; number
tends to be lower than the &quot;Research&quot; number.  My 1600DP bus lives
very happily on 87 octane unleaded regular.
