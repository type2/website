Subject: Everybus was so cool (despite the rain)

I just got home and I had to write and say that we had a great time at
Everybus, as did our little kids, Schuyler and Paige.  It was inspiring
to see so many busses in one spot, everyone was so friendly and the
potluck was terrific!  We made it home fine but it figures that my bus
would wait till all Everybus attendees were out of the picture to start
making a noise, which I hope is not an expensive noise since I am pretty
broke at this point.  When we turn the wheel hard either way it makes a
severe squeaking noise that sounds like it is coming from right under
the wheels.  It will also make this noise if you kind of bounce up and
down in the seat, but not as bad.  I suspect (with my extremely limited
knowledge) that this is some type of bearing or something.  It still
handles just fine.  Any ideas?  Good to see/meet everyone!  Beth DeVos,
NJ, green 78 bus.
