Subject: RE: [T2] baby hammock

Hi,

I have a few sets USED (with mounting screws) of the Westy child cot
brackets
($10 plus $5 shipping/handling), if anyone jumps on Ron's child cot offer.

&quot;This includes the canvas and the poles, but not the mounts on the A/B
pillars
(so if you have a non-Westy you'd have to fabricate something there).&quot;


I am a &quot;virtual&quot; wrecking yard, selling
GOOD USED PARTS, mostly ORIGINAL STOCK.
&quot;HAPPINESS GUARANTEED&quot;

Best Regards,
