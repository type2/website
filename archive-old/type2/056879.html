Subject: Body panel sources

I'm about to start some major body work on my '72 poptop.  I searched the
archives and gleaned the following:

    -pay for quality
    -Das Bulli Haus, RMMW, and Mills Supply may have quality
    -you never know what they're going to send, or how well it will fit

I'm trolling for opinions on body panels and sources for same.  I live in
the Chicago area,
so J.C. Whitney and MOFOCO are within an hours driving distance.  Because
freight can be costly on large
panels, it would be nice to be able to pick them up, and inspect them before
purchase.  However, both of these sources are highly suspect in terms of
quality.   What I'm wondering is:

1)  Are these discount houses getting their stuff from the same suppliers as
the above listed recommended
      sources.  How many places can be making panels for buses anyway?

2)  How does the steel itself vary in quality, not just fit?  or How can I
distinguish quality panels from junk?
