Hello folks,

I really hate to start another tire thread, but I found some Cooper 
tires that weren't mentioned in the list archive.

Cooper SRM II Radial LT 185R14C
Load Index: 102
Load Range: D
Infl. Pres: 65
Max Load: 1875

Or you can view the specs at:
http://www.avontires_dot_com/cooper/srmiirad.htm

Does anybody have any experience or opinions on these?  I don't know 
what they cost, but I have had good experiences with Cooper truck tires.
