Subject: Re: [T2] ListServs and Pix

&gt; [1] I think we missed our ten-year aniversary, should have been held last
&gt; fall sometime.  Gerry Skerbitz, the man to blame for all of this started
&gt; the list some time in the fall of 1994.  I know I got on in January of '95
&gt; and the list was a going concenr by then.  TEN YEARS!!!  Damn... where did
&gt; the time go?
Hmmmm, I thought it was the spring of 1994...seems like I joined in the
summer, before fall semester started...it was definitely before I
graduated, although I'm not as clear on that ancient history as I once
was!
:)
I'm sure Uncle Joel could tell the story...
but yes, that was eons &amp; eons ago technologically...back when computers
had black screens &amp; green or orange letters!!!
