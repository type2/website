&gt; they are forced to take them directly to the crusher.  It wouldn't

&gt; whatever they want, but obviously their goal isn't to help _anyone_
&gt; keep an older vehicle on the road.
George:
I'm sure that their non-public opinion is that it would be counter to
their goal of reducing smoggy vehicles to allow any parts back on the
market.
They pay $500 to get one off the road, the recycler sells parts to keep
10 more smoggy cars on the road- where's the logic in that?
Face it, WE ARE THE ENEMY !! Buy a KIA, get rid of that noxious old
acVW! I have lots of em, but most don't run, so I'm not as dangerous to
air users as the rest of you that actually dare to DRIVE your cars.
(Though some of mine have tied quite a few oxygen molecules up to their
iron - I guess that oxygen isn't available to breathe.) :^)
