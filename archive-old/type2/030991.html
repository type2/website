&gt; Following the FI troubleshooting procedure in the Type2 Library at:
&gt;                  http://econwpa.wustl_dot_edu/~samid/afc/
&gt; 
&gt; I came to the following advice(http://econwpa.wustl_dot_edu/~samid/afc/p_24c.html):
&gt; &quot;Switch ignition on and contact test light to terminal 88z and ground and then 86c and ground. 
&gt; If test light lights up on both terminals, replace relay       If test light
 does not light up, check and repair defective wire&quot;

it is a bit confusing

&gt; Just to be sure, I thought I'd check here. My terminals (and the ballast
 resistors) only get juice when I'm *cranking* the bus; not when I turn
 the key to ON. This seems like a wiring problem to me, but I thought I'd
 double-check with *you*. Ignition ON means KEY ON right? Not &quot;starter turning.&quot;

nope they get juice when the &quot;trigger&quot; fires the injectors.
