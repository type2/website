For those list-members in the countries near Holland:

The Dutch VW Bus Club have organised a weekend meeting celebrating their 5th
year in existance on June 4, 5 and 6 (in Borculo, Holland).

All bus owners (any year) are welcome. Plenty of space. Camping fee is
around $25 for the weekend.
All we need is some good weather and it will be great. We expect 100-150
buses!

If your interested p-mail me. Note: I will be away from home from May 22 -
30.
