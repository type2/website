&gt; If you can't crack it that way and are too afraid of loosing the washer into
&gt; the fan housing, then remove fan belt first loosen the fan housing screws,
&gt; disconnect thermostat under engine, take off gen strap, lift up the fan
&gt; housing and wedge two pieces of wood under either side under the housing,
&gt; now loosen fan to shroud screws
&gt; and work the gen/fan combo out. Once out lock vice grips on the pulley end
&gt; of
&gt; generator which in turn is wedged to the ground, step on that combination
&gt; and slip
&gt; your 36&quot; socket on fan nut + big breaker bar then pry or crack the bar with
&gt; a 5lb sledge.

Wow!  Vise grips on the pulley and a sledge hammer!  Your nut must have
been welded on!

I've never had problems loosening a fan nut.  It's only on with 42 ft-lbs
of torque.

Having done the job with the &quot;stick wood under the shroud&quot;
method a couple of times I will never do it that way again.  It is
virtually impossible to be sure that the shroud tin is seated correctly
inside the cylinder tin on reassembly (incorrect assembly jams the flaps),
and on a doghouse engine you have to reach around in front of the shroud
to dismantle and reassemble the doghouse pieces anyway.  The fan is such a
tight fit in the hole that it is really difficult to juggle the heavy
generator in the relatively loose shroud while getting the fan aligned
with the hole it has to pass through.  It's much easier with the fan by
itself.

The chances of losing the little screws from the doghouse
ductwork is much greater than that of losing the BIG washers and shims
from the fan.  The screws on the end of the fan shroud (behind the dual
port end castings) are a bear to work with as well.
