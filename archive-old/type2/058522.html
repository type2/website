Subject: Friday-VW Show Eugene, Oregon

The Eugene Celebration is this weekend!!  A weekend when the downtown area is shut down to make room for a giant party!  Parade, bands, beer, booths, and new to this year--
Bugs, Buses, and Beyond  
Celebrating a timeless classic
A gathering of Eugene's VW's!!
It's to be held Saturday and Sunday.
Some traditional classes, and Celebration classes (biggestt dent, most rust, largest oil spot, and most dead stickers)  
Should be a load of fun and all you have to do is flash you celebration pin to get into the show, which btw is some very kick ass parking. Show starts at 12:00.  Also new this year the celebration is giving away-
from the past- a 73 bus
from the present- a 98 beetle
from the future- a new computer

so it you happen to be in the Eugene area stop on by.  I'll be there all day Saturday and Sunday, bringing the 57' sc and my wife is bringing the dreaded hot rod 412 station wagen.  This is not a show for trailer queens!!  
Peace, Love, and  bring the daily driver,
    Mr. Bubble Head
