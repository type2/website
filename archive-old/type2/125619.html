Subject: Re: [T2] Re: I just stripped the interior of my 73 Westy...

Hmmm, one of the things I really like about the sink/icebox combo on my 72 is 
the spice rack and fold out shelf on the side. The shelf is the perfect place to 
set up my camp stove.
Oh well different strokes and all that :-)

Greg Said; 
Allow me to play Devil's Advocate for a moment. Please understand that 
these are my opinions about westy's *I* have owned, and if people are 
happy with their bus then I'm happy for them. 
 
The standard 196x-73 westy interior is the worst use of space possible  for a daily driver. The icebox won't hold a six-pack and the sink won't 
hold enough wash water to properly wash a dinner plate.
