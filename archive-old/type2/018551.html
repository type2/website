Subject: GEX Engines?
Message-ID: &lt;37692285.3E09B366_at_redsword_dot_com&gt;

I have heard that a lot of ya'll son't like GEX engines. Why? I will be
needing a new engine for my 74 bus (1800 dual carb) and was looking at
their hydraulic package. All I have heard is &quot;Oh god, not, not them&quot; but
no meat behind it. I am genuinely interested in hearing experiences with
different suppliers (in the NorCal area, or relatively near it). I want
&quot;Real&quot; not &quot;a friend of a friend said...&quot;.

Thanks!

Did Roman Medics refer to IV's as 4's?
