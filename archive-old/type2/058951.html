Subject: Westy Table hook

Hi Folks,
I'm in need of the plastic part that is on the back side (bottom, when
the table is folded down) of the  Westfalia table. The part is used to
hook onto a metal bracket that is
mounted on the wall. I'm not sure what the part is called, but it is
shaped in a U and the metal bracket locks into it so the table will stay
in place.
If any one knows a source, it would be great. The local Junk Yard wants
to sell the entire
table.

Thanks
George
