Brian what kind of oil do you use I use Pennzoil 20-50 and at 130 Celsius or
about 266 Fahrenheit the oil warning lite comes on flickering clearly
overheating. I just replaced both cylinderheads and I try to be as careful
as possible to avoid overheating, all the tin is in place, timing is right
on, but still gets hot, I rinsed the oil cooler about 8000 km ago
when the engine got rebuild so it should be clean. any ideas ?
 Karl

&gt;Karl I've got the same scenario.
&gt;I'm useing an 87 Audi GT sending unit that screws directly into the oli
&gt;bypass valve (replacing the stock plug) I'm showing 130 celsius or about
&gt;266 degrees faremheit.
&gt;To convert Celsius temperatures into Fahrenheit:
&gt;Begin by multiplying the Celsius temperature by 9.
&gt;Divide the answer by 5.
&gt;Now add 32.
&gt;Most list members claim to running about 240 degrees farenheit but
&gt;although my oil temp is reading high I don't think the oil is realy 266
&gt;hot.
&gt;My engine is new and I'd suspect that it may drop some after breakin.
&gt;The outside temperature here in Texas has been between 90 nand 100 daily
&gt;so I'd expect a little hot. Around town just average driving I'm running
&gt;212 to 220, but a highway speeds it climbs on up there to 266.
