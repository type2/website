Subject: Piece of paradise

For Sale in the town of Stockton, Utah. An entire VW
junkyard, including house, garages, a bunches of type
1 and 2 hulks, and &quot;tools.&quot;
Could this be the end of the rainbow for someone out
there?  ;-)

Well, get out ur map: It's about an hour west of Salt
Lake City on the north end of Rush Lake.  Biggest
nearby town is Tooele and the Army's fabulous Deseret
Chemcial Warfare Depot. 
 
If anyone is seriously interested I'll run down the
fone #.
