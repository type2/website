The 76 should fit the 78 eng. OK, but I have a 75 I want to restore, and it
has a throttle switch on the side of the throttle not on the 78, and also
the air sensor MPC in the later AF meters has an extra connector (see
Bentley) for the air sensor inside of it.  That's a tougher call- try using
the 76 AF unit in the 78 so the plug will fit and match the 76 control
unit.  Otherwise you'd have to use the 78 control unit and scrounge the
wiring harness to match, or rig your own wire from the 7th connector?  MB
