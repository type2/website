Subject: Re: [T2] Light additions, inverters

Try running the engine while you use it, maybe your battery has a bum cell 
that makes it's output voltage lower than the inverter requires. Mine has a 
low voltage warning that causes a buzzer to start making noise when the 
battery gets low and when it gets to the lower limit of battery voltage it 
interrupts the inverter's operation. When the battery is this low, better 
hope the engine will fire right up because there is not much reserve 
available.

Also be sure that the cables that supply the inverter are big. Mine will 
run on small wires (the size of wiring typically found in a VW) such as 
through the cigarette lighter BUT if I want to supply to max power through 
the inverter I have to use heavy cables directly clamped to the battery.

Think of it this way - imagine the wires to be the equivalent of water 
pipes. A small pipe (wire) can only move so much water (power or current). 
The larger the pipe (wire) the larger amount of water pressure (current).

Your inverter may require more power than the wiring it is connected to can 
supply. I have never had much luck with supplying power for anything very 
big with the cigarette lighter - mostly I'm only able to charge a camcorder 
battery or the like.




&gt;&gt;And anything you can run off of 12 volts directly such as a TV or a light 
&gt;&gt;or whatever I would. The inverter itself consumes some power - mine gets 
&gt;&gt;warm with a large load. Mine also runs a fan when it is on.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Chris, I have a moderate sized inverter,I think 250 watt, with a hoigher 
&gt;peak, but I cannot get my 80 watt TV/VCR to operate in the VW, either on 
&gt;12DC or through the inverter.
&gt;
&gt;Also, I could not run a simple drill through the inverter.
