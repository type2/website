I like to think it was a natural evolution of a good design.  I don't see
anyone arguing that a gland nut is better than 5 smaller (and lower torque)
bolts.  There is a reason that all modern engines (that I know of) attach
their flywheels similar to the way the type IV engine does and not with a
gland nut.

There is some truth to the &quot;insatiable power demands&quot; argument, but it all
comes down to how much is enough.  For me, 50hp is not enough.  Not enough
to pull hills at a reasonable speed, not enough to keep up with traffic on
the interstate, not enough to beat that train at the crossing.  Just
kidding about that last one, but hey, if I can't stop because I greased my
brake drums, I have to speed up, right?  :)
