Subject: Why did they cut my bus?

In the rear compartment of my 1973 Bus, immediately behind the rearmost seat
someone has cut three sides of a square into the floor panel. This is in the
panel that forms the top of the engine compartment. The cut is in the center
and about 6 to 8 inches on a side. They didn't actually remove the metal.
They just made a really sloppy cut. Several of the buses I've looked at (all
baywindows) have this same cut.

Does anyone know why the cut was made? Can it be repaired? What is the best
way to repair it?
