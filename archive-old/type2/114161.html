There is an ideal fan speed but it depends on too many factors: the ambient temperature and the amount of work the engine is doing. The temperature obviously changes, and the load changes depending on the incline, weight, wind resistance etc.

I've heard that running on an engine stand, the stock fan produces maximum cooling at 3800rpm. It's interesting to note that the torque of the bus engine maxes out about that rpm also. On the road I'm not sure it really helps to know any of that and you'll have to resort to relying on the temperature gauges rather than the tachometer.
