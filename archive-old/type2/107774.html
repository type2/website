Subject: rear transmission mounts

Hello all,
My question today for the list:  When I removed my engine/manual gearbox I
noticed that both the rear transmission mounts (item 8 on page 81 of the
Haynes manual) had delaminated, as well as the engine mounts on the support
beam.  Is this a common problem?  Should I be looking for a greater problem?
I have purchased two new engine mounts ($12 CDN each) but the tranny mounts
are no longer available at my local VW specialist shop...but they may be
available at the dealer for $44 each.  Ouch!  Is it a common problem for
these mounts to delaminate?  Can they be repaired with adhesive?  I'm gonna
try the wreckers this weekend to see if there are any in good condition.

An update to my Newbie question regarding type 4 case welding.  Thanks for
the feedback regarding the weldabilty of the crank case.  I got the tab
welded back on (so-so job :( and took the case, crank and rods to the local
VeeDub machine shop for fitting of bearings.  I hope all goes well with the
case knock on wood, I do have an old AW case to fall back on if required.
The shop is also gonna check to see if my pistons and cylinders are
serviceable or not.  My camshaft and solid lifters were pronounced DOA so I
have to put them on my shopping list.  I had my exhaust valve guides in my
cylinder heads replaced last weekend and I reground my own valve seats and
am now lapping in new valves.  My 5 rib tranny proved to be totally bagged
but I was lucky to find a retired VW transmission specialist who kindly
overhauled it for me...new main pinion bearing, replaced 1st and 2nd gears
and their carrier housing,  rebuilt nosecone etc etc..  Apparently the
little breather hole was plugged with silicone from a previous repair
contributing to the oil leakage.  He said it is a common problem to watch
out for.  I've replaced all my shift rod bushings and rear fork (had to use
3 front bushings on the after rod as the rear ones are on longer
available...followed the great &quot;how to&quot; article by Ron Van Ness).  I have to
repair the front shift rod slot still where the shifter pin worn it and I
have to replace the shifter lever as the pin and the gate disc are worn.
I've machined an adapter for a 65 amp Delco alternator to replace the Bosch
unit as well and am installing a second battery with a battery isolator.
I've also removed my BA-6 heater, if anyone needs one for parts.  This is
the most involved clutch change I have ever done, 4 weeks and
counting...haven't even bought a new clutch yet ;)

Cheers,
Drew
