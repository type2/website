I think having a camping list on the AIRS list is a great idea! I hope I am 
not violating any rules when I mention this, but the site, www.westfalia_dot_org, 
has a link for their list members, that give brief descriptions and offerings 
by way of tools, camping available, and so on. The list is divided into 
geographic territories. Most people offer overnight camping, tools, a place 
to work, coffee, etc. IMHO This would be a great offering, and I for one, 
would be willing to offer anything I could.
