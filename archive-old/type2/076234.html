Subject: Re: [T2] Dead Front axle beam (Was: UPDATE: NJ inspection woes)

Steve/others

Why? do they rust from the inside out?

Is this something that can be fixed(before getting bad) with por-15 or
something similar?

Cheers, dave

&gt; 
&gt; That is a dying beam.  look at the uprights on either end of your beam for
&gt; any sign of rust.  Since my experience has been that the beam rusts out
&gt; from the inside, by the time you see it, the only solution is to replace.
&gt; Also, replace quickly!  The first sign means that vast areas are thin and
&gt; you can go from godd to marginal to dead in a matter of months.

&gt; &gt; Incidentally, a couple of you appropriately asked about the integrity of my
&gt; &gt; front beam.  I've checked it out in the past (I just put new shocks, sway
&gt; &gt; bar &amp; steering dampner on this summer so had lots of time to look around
&gt; &gt; down there :), but can't say I know exactly what I'm looking for.  If I post
&gt; &gt; some pictures to a website maybe some of y'all can tell me if it looks bad?
