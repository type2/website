Subject: 1600cc dp for sale

Anyone in need of a good running 1600cc dp?  I parted
out my 71 Westy and most of the parts are spoken for,
but still no takers on the engine.
Good running 1600cc dp, rebuilt roughly 10K ago by PO.
 Turnkey!  Includes old starter, new starter,
generator, remote oil filter... everything you need to
push your bus down the road.  Has heat exchangers but
not exaust... that rotted pretty bad and I tossed.
I am asking $500 for this nice engine.
will not ship, but will help in delivery.
May 21-23, Buses, Bands and Brews, Oregana OH
June ~18th, Kansas, Missouri area
July ~18th, Vermont, NH, NY ara
Or pick up in Toledo OH
