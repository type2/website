HHello all!

This fall I am sending my bus to the restoration shop to get
pretty.  I would like to get the fiberglass poptop back into shape
as well and I have a couple of questions.

First, there is a dent, with a crack in the center near the vent 
tube lays.  Any suggestions on how I can fix this myself?

Some of the fibers are visable through out the surface of the top,
what needs to be done, if anything, to prepare the surface for paint.

I plan on having the paint shop spray the top with a coat of silver
and clearcoat.  Does this present a problem in itself, or change the
entire prep process?

Thanks for any info you might be able to offer!
