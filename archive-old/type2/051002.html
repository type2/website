Subject: Re: [T2] Fw: usual rust

Serious to the point of penetration. Now water is available to the iron
kept well satuarted under the floor mat. This is the entropy of the
universe. Water+air+iron=rust. 

Decide now whether to fix this chassie or get another. Rust repair of the
under windshield will easily cost less than half as much as adding floor
and step repair just a few years later.

For what it's worth, I have the very same problem with my '72. I'm still
trying to find a good German windshield before I fix this. 

A very decent cared for 71 Westy will be available here soon. More info by
pmail if interested. I will be repairing his new '72 2.0L Westy next week.

&gt; How serious is the rust under the windshield if it has progressed to
