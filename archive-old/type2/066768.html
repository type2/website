&gt; 
&gt; Where would you like to be able to drive your favorite VW if given the time,
&gt; health, and a modest budget. Who would you take along and why? What vehicle
&gt; would you take?

I'd head north from here in the '71 Westy with my sweetheart... Stop by
Lake Lila in the Adirondacks for a couple of days, have breakfast in
Long Lake... Then I'd scoot up north to the Canadanian border. Pick up
Highway 17 in Ottawa, head west through Sudbury, etc. to the North Shore
of Lake Superior. Settle down and camp for a week or so. Then I'd
dribble on down south through Thunder Bay and Grand Portage into
Minnesota; stop for a blueberry pie at Betty's Pies in Two Harbors, stop
and see my cousin Matt in Duluth and my Gramma in Chisago City, then
head west.

&gt;From there I don't know the names of the roads too well; I'd take the
interstate across N. Dakota and Eastern Montana, then head up through
the rockies back into Canada. From there I'd just wander around the
hills, heading vaguely westward, until we got to Vancouver.

&gt;From there (I have no knowledge of geography at ALL from this point
onwards) we'd slide down the coast all the way to San Diego, then head
inland. Cruise through the southwest on into west Texas, stop by in
Austin to say hi to friends, spend a day in Panama City, Florida (I love
Panama City - and I don't even know why) and then head up the east coast
back home, stopping by the Carolina Bug Shop in Charleston long enough
to have the new engine we order from Ken there swapped in and have a cup
of coffee and talk about compression ratios.

That's the trip - and if we're lucky, we're going to do it next August!

Until then, we'll settle for going to Maine in November.

Can't wait to hear the other dream trips,

Anton
