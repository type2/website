Subject: Re: [T2] Rotary fuel pump for carbs

&gt; The only problem we had (run on) was completely our fault. We wired it up to
&gt; a separate switch for power and when you turned off the engine before
&gt; turning the pump off the engine would run-on. We went in circles examining
&gt; what was wrong with the carb before going doh!

This is a big concern with aftermarket electric fuel pumps. Hence the
various multi-kill wiring schemes.

I remember going through the same thing with my old Chevy Vega. The
fuel pump was triggered by an oil pressure switch that had failed on.
So I was going nuts trying to figure out why I had to replace the
needle and seat valve every 2 weeks. Once I found it I wired it to a
relay triggered by the coil + side. Never had a problem after that,
though a stall would leave the pump running...
