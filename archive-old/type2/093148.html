Subject: Re: [T2] Anyone know any further info about these campers?

Yes!!!!

&gt;I see you got the pic from one of my sites. The VCT2 site you were on is a
&gt;new baywindow club that has started in may. I am the secretary and
&gt;co-webmaster.
&gt;
&gt;The depicted camper is originally a bus conversion that was made by the
&gt;company of Kemperink in Almelo-Harbrinkhoek in the Netherlands. It was
&gt;designed as a small truck for light goods and big volume. The trucks were
&gt;offered thru the Volkswagen dealerships making it a VW-Kemperink
&gt;cooperation. They were also sold in Germany and the UK.
&gt;Alot of these trucks were delivered to a Dutch biscuit factory called
&gt;Bolletje. The nickname of these buses became thus Bolletje Bus. But also dry
&gt;cleaning companies embraced this type of van.


THANK YOU!

Really a neat looking vehicle. Would make a nice camper with a bit more HP 
like a Corvair or Porsche engine.
