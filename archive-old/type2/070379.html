Subject: speaking of bears....

hey now,

speaking of bears....i have a bumper sticker that says &quot;BearlyMuven&quot; with a
dancing bear...also have a &quot;Girls Kick Ass&quot;, an american flag that has pot
plants instead of stars and says &quot;Towards Harmonius Civilization&quot;, another one
that says &quot;All the years combined, they melt into a dream 1965-1995, a list
sticker, a phish sticker, ...i can't remember what else. but i've never been
pulled over in my bus by the cops. i used to be pulled over and hassled in my
mazda 626 which was covered in dead stickers though. go figure.

of course i'd never have anything in the van that would get me into too much
trouble. even if there was nothing in the van that would get me in trouble i'd
make the officer get a search warrant. just say no.
