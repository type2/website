&gt;65/70 PSI, as things heat up and I'm zooming down the
&gt;freeway at 60/65 it goes as low as 20PSI.  At hot idle
&gt;it is 8/10 PSI by the gauge, the oil light never
&gt;flickers or comes on.  Is this a normal range for this
&gt;vehicle?

If you only have 20 psi at speed (assuming 60-65 in 4th is
at least 2500 rpm which is true) you got issues.  Now I'm
not saying the engine is the issue, could be that your oil
temps are actually like 260F or so and that is all she can
make cause it is overheating, running lean, badly adjusted
carbs, plugged up oil cooler, whatever.

You should see at LEAST 28 psi on that good Castrol 20W50
over 2500 revs.  8/10 at idle is sufficient but marginally at best,
certainly 15-20 would be desireable there.  But the hot
at rev number is what is scary on your engine.  Since the
thing seems to make plenty of pressure cold, I'm almost
more leaning to it being the engine is just darn hot than
a problem with the pump or bottom end.  I'd install an oil
temp gage in the little rear corner sump plate, and at the
same time do a switch to straight 40 or 50 weight Castrol
or Valvoline and go from there.  If the gage shows 250+ at
cruise, you got overheating problems, if you are doing 230
or so and still can't make pressure on the straight weight
oil, you got some eventual bottom end worries.  But if the
temps are OK and SAE 40 oil takes you up to 25-30 psi
at 60 mph, I wouldn't go tearing anything down just yet, I
would certainly gripe to GEX not that that will do much.
