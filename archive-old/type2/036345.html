Mind you, I'm not so sure that old VW's are any more long lasting than any
other, it's just that they made more in the first place, so they are dying
out slower.


that finally prompted me to write what i had been pondering on the walk to 
work last week(it was origionally much better worded and structured, but its 
been a week and ive forgotten a lot...how much longer do we have? how long 
till the acvw becomes more or less extinct? in 20 years, even the 70s models 
will be 50 years old...how many 50s era acvws do we still have running 
around today? granted there were fewer produced in the 50s, but the mid 70s 
werent exactly land-mark years as for as production was concerned 
either...im sure therell still be a few holding onto theirs, and there will 
always be museum pieces, but how many daily drivers will we still be seeing 
come 2020? i invite any of you west coasters to come over here to the other 
coast to see how sparse they can get...im always surprised going between my 
place outside of baltimore to washington (state) to visit my folks and 
coming back here to see the disparity in numbers...it seems you cant leave 
the house without being run over by a veedub there, but here...you really 
gotta search...blame it on the salt.
how many vws are still on the road? theres the constant attrition of wrecks, 
rust and just plain abandonment going on on a daily basis. with production 
ceased and finite numbers left, its only a matter of time till there arent 
enough to support the garages and businesses that still produce replacement 
parts and then where will we be?
so, again, how much longer do we have?
