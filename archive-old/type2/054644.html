&gt;  I'm looking for a pointer to a simple 'how to' hook up my second
&gt;  battery and my Hella single-relay kit.  Instructions with it are
&gt;  insufficient for me, and, while I found tons of technical information
&gt;  in the archives, I don't know enough to make it useful, and it always
&gt;  consistent.  Recently someone asked a similar question and I don't
&gt;  recall any specific answers being offered.  Bob Wallace posted a
&gt;  diagram back in '97 but the formatting got bunked up in the archives.
&gt;  This is a 1&quot; cube with 4 terminals, 30, 86, 85 and 87.  Wiring diagram
&gt;  that came with it offers the following: 85 is ground, 30 is 'vehicle
&gt;  battery' but unclear if that is aux. or main, 86 is 'fused relay' - a
&gt;  12v supply that is only alive when ignition is on.  87 is for 'connect
&gt;  to pin 2 for aux battery or pin 6 for fridge' (which I don't have).
&gt;  It also notes alternative wiring 87 for charging aux battery 'via
&gt;  single pole plug and socket not included'.  A little diagram is also
&gt;  found on the side of the relay but that is less clear.

Hi Pat, 

As my past has come back to haunt me, I'll give this a go....

So if you look at the base of the relay you should see 3 terminals parallel 
to each other and one at right angles to the others. Orientate the relay so 
that the terminal at right angles to the others is right to left on the side 
closest to you like this....

... then the generic way to wire a relay is as follows
top pin = power in
lower pin = relay on, power out
left pin = switching power in
right pin = earth
(purists may say that right and left should be the other way around but in my 
experience it works both ways)

So the wiring suggested in your instructions is...
top pin = power in = main battery +ve terminal 
lower pin = relay on, power out = auxiliary battery +ve terminal
left pin = switching power in = ignition on power supply eg coil +ve
right pin = earth = any earth point on the bus

When the instructions refer to pin 2 or pin 6 they are referring to the pin 
layout in a 12S trailer socket/plug where the auxiliary battery and or fridge 
would be in the towed caravan/trailer.

However this wiring does have the draw back in that the two batteries will be 
connected whenever the key is on - this means that if one battery is low then 
the  charge will try to equalise which may in extreme cases cause on 
no-start-scenario. If the main battery is low then you will draw the starting 
current from the auxiliary battery and fry the wiring and or relay which is 
not a good idea. 

To improve this so that the two batteries are not connected during the 
starting cycle then instead of connecting the right pin to earth connect it 
to the wire that comes from your alternator and goes to the dash board idiot 
light. the relay will then only turn on, connecting the two batteries, when 
the ignition is on and the light is off.

(this solution is much simpler and more elegant than the one you found in the 
archives)

Please note that as you are adding a new circuit to your van it should be 
protected by a fuse between the main battery and the relay - I suggest you 
use a 16 amp fuse as if your aux battery is low it will easily need that 
much. Check this fuse often at first to ensure that your regular pattern of 
use does not lower the aux battery charge so far that it needs more charge; 
if it blows regulary due to low aux battery charge go up to a 25amp fuse but 
no further. Also you will find that and ordinary inline nylon fuse holder is 
only rated for about 5amps and will melt under a continuos higher load so you 
will need a more substantial fuse holder.

I hope that I've made the above clear, if not send me a personal e-mail.

Good luck

e-mail only, not to the list!!!!  :-)
