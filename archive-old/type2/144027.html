&gt; I found a great place to buy used engines and since i was looking i decided

&gt; fit or not. Any advice is appriciated.

This is not a decision to be made lightly!  Fitting the engine in the bay
is the first 10% of the job.  After that, you still have to deal with
throttle, cooling, heat, exhaust, ground clearance, fuel, air cleaner,
electrical, etc. etc.!

The best info I've seen comes from Kennedy Engineered Products:

They seem to lean toward the 1800, though I would think that the 2.2 and
2.5 engines would fit if the intake is modified for clearance.  I think
the larger displacment engines are a better way to get the desired
horsepower than the turbo 1800.

There is a strong case to be made to start with a wasserboxer vanagon
rather than a bay.  Having the cooling system already in place is a major
advantage.
