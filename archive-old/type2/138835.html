&gt; Right. One of the guys on the list sent me the reference from the Muir book
&gt; in chapter 20, pp 434 to 435. Do you have Muir?
&gt; 
&gt; This probably depends too on whether your 2L is a genuine stock 2L which was
&gt; only 78-79. If so, Muir says only transmissions from 76-79 will work with
&gt; it. He says the pilot shaft is too short on earlier transmissions, and
&gt; barely fits into the pilot bearing. He says when the pilot bearing goes, it
&gt; can trash the front tranny seal, and even ruin the bell housing if let go
&gt; too long, so I won't know if my tranny is okay until I remove the engine.
&gt; You could be okay if you have an older engine that was opened up to 2L.

I don't understand the logic in Muir.

John Hilgerdt recounts the story of a 75 tranny that chewed up the pilot
bearing of a 78 bus. There is no good reason for this because the 228mm
flywheel won't fit a 002 bellhousing so a compatible flywheel must have been
used.

I can only speculate as to what parts they actually used because the input
shaft is the same length and the pilot bearing is the same distance from tip
of the input shaft among Type 4 flywheels.

What seems more probable is that they used a 68-71 tranny but since the
68-71 flywheel won't bolt onto any Type 4 engine, they used a 72-75
incompatible flywheel so the parts mismatch to make it &quot;work&quot; was
horrendous!
