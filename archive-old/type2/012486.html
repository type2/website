&gt;the original beam are OK. Once I got the old seals out, I found a circular
&gt;spring, and this is what I'm hung up on. I've looked in Bentley and Haynes
&gt;and I can't find this spring shown or mentioned anywhere. It's between the
&gt;seal and the inner bearing. When putting things back together, does it just

came out of the seal.

If about the same diameter and say 1/8&quot; coil sized spring.  Thats what clamps
the seal lip to the surface it rides on.
