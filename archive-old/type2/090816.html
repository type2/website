Subject: Re: [T2] Hooking up brake servo w/ Dual Webers

Ok, yeah... My bus IS hard to stop when the engine is
off. I always wondered why. My bus isn't here right
now, but I remember puzzling over the tube coming from
the front that hooked into the filter area of my weber
progressive. Maybe that could help YOU.... It didn't
hook up to the manifolds, but to the underside of the
chamber where the filter is. Hmmmmmm... Maybe, I could
do without the split and just hook it up to one of the
dual carbs. Would the vacuum be enough, though? Maybe
that could explain why in the cold, my engine would
often die when I hit the brakes while coasting in
neutral...
                                      -Paul

As far as the brake servo... starting in '71 (I
&gt; think), 
&gt; the bus went to power assisted brakes.  Do you
&gt; notice 
&gt; when you try your brakes when it's not running that
&gt; it's 
&gt; harder than hell until you start it up?  If not,
&gt; this 
&gt; may have been disconnected by a previous owner.
