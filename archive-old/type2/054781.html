Subject: Re: Steering Box??

&gt;Im going to need a steering box for my 68. 68-72 is the same I think.
Anyway if youve seen the cost of a rebuilt you know why Im looking. &lt;

I bought a brand new steering box for my 72 Bus in Mexico last year.
Interestingly enough it also fits the Busses up to 79.
It is made by &quot;WAT&quot; in Spain (I think) and cost approx. $230.

At the time it was a kind of panic buy on my way back from Belize and Guatemala. In Guatemala I had fallen into a huge pothole/mountainslide, bent the bumper, flattened the 72-only towhook, flattend the front pan and mostly landed on the steering box. The steering lever was pushed backwards with force, which means I turned left. Luckily I stopped before going downhill. Don't drive at night in Guatemala.
Afterwards the steering wheel was offset 45 degrees and I was worried. Imagine my surprise when a dealer in Mexico handed me a new steering gear on request. I never installed it as the problem turned out to be a bent tie rod. The steering gear is now my security blanket.
In 2 weeks I will take my 67 Westy to Panama. Now that steering gear is a problem! They don't even remember the splitty busses down there.
