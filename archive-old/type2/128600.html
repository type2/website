&gt; Do you know what the Compression Ratio is?  Or was the motor just put

&gt; you
&gt; have a high compression ratio, we only have low octane gas now, and 
&gt; you have
&gt; an engine that runs chronically hot.  BTDT...........Too many times 
&gt; until i
&gt; really got into measuring all this and assuming nothing.
&gt;
&gt; You can buy a Gundson (sp) gas tester for about $150.........or twice 
&gt; the
&gt; cost of a shop to sniff it for you and have the tool.
&gt;
&gt; Give me the part number off your afm................i may have a spare
&gt; around here you can try on for size and see if it helps.  That is what 
&gt; i
&gt; would do.....plug in an AFM off a bus that does not have these 
&gt; symptoms and
&gt; see what happens to the CHT then.
&gt;

I posted extensively in May with regards to setting my compression 
ratio when I installed these heads.  The final compression ratio for my 
engine when I assembled it then was/is 7.2 : 1, just slightly less than 
the stock 7.3 : 1.  This delivers a cold compression test result of 135 
- 140 psig.  These are measured values, i.e. I measured stroke, CC'd 
the heads and shimmed the cylinder base in order to arrive at this 
compression ratio.  No head gaskets/shims were used.  The last set of 
heads that were installed were running at a compression ratio of 6.6 : 
1 (thats a whole n'other story),  and still burned thee exhaust valves 
at 7k miles, so it is not a compression ratio issue.  Its not an octane 
issue either.  The engine does not ping and I have tried running 
premium and it has no effect on CHT.

Your suggested in your previous post that I would be adjusting the AFM 
by the seat of the pants.  I don't see it that way.  I would be 
adjusting the AFM using my O2 sensor per the method suggested in Probst 
and verifying the results using my CHT.
