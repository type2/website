&gt; Hi guys
&gt;
&gt; I took the spark plug out but......., they came with some material of the  heads in the treads, I cleaned the sparks plugs and the heads hole and tried to put them back but the treads in the heads are torn so what's next, try to put the helicoils with the heads on or take out the heads and do the job, I am a little bit concern about the debris that may be into the cylinder.
&gt; It is my very first time putting a helicoil or taking out the heads. Which way is safest ?

Remove the heads and put in good solid inserts, not helicoils.  You might
want to consult with an automotive machine shop.  Take them the heads to
inspect.
