Subject: [T2] turn signals

arghhh,
a week or two ago, someone had a problem with their turn 
signals.....hazards worked but no turn signal.  anyway, i have the same 
problem NOW and have since deleted the solving email.  i must have 
disconnected something in the process of installing my heater cables.

could someone send this to me, or give me advice on the solution?

thanks in advance!!
