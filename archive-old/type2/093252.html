Subject: Re: [T2] Insulation, Where??

Mc-Master Carr has much better materials for I'll bet a cheaper price...

A local source to check would be commercial HVAC contractors - we have a 
local service that will allow me to prowl through their warehouse 
occasionally. They use ALOT of these materials (and better) and will sell 
you a greater quantity for a lower price.

Also check refrigeration and electrical supply houses.

Lastly look for Industrial Rubber and gasket suppliers.

Typically the commercial guys can sell you vast quantities for a fraction 
of the price of the catalogs like JC Whitney who are just reselling materials.

&gt;Anyone have a source, other than JC Whitney, to look for the Insulation 
&gt;that has the Felt with Aluminum coating?  I've checked Lowes, Home Depot 
&gt;and a local Building Supply store and all they have is the Airbubble 
&gt;plastic with Aluminum.
