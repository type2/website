Subject: Re: [T2] Any More Power from a Pertronix &quot;Flame Thrower&quot; coil?

Edward
I agree with George on his response.  As you &quot;upgrade&quot; one unit, it is a good 
idea to upgrade all affected units. As mentioned the 009 is not necc an 
upgrade, your better off with a vacuum advance distributer ( I too use a V/A 
Dis with a new 009 as a backup)...I use a &quot;Flamethrower Coil&quot; and the 
&quot;Flamethrower ignition wires&quot;...as well as a Universal CDI (Capacitive 
Discharge Ignition) and Bosch W8 Platinum Plugs (gapped at .045)...I also got 
a &quot;Hot Start Relay...(also Bosch).  I don't mind changing out points, so I 
kept those in instead of a Pertronix replacement...This is all in a 76.  If 
the list has any more reccomendations for my set up, I'm open...I really 
appreciate the information and advice provided...I hope after all is said and 
done, you get the &quot;right&quot; set up for you...
Aloha
