Subject: Re: [T2] OK, sold 79, now I'm after a vanagon

Hello All    I happen to like my wasserboxers, Have held up real good, on my 
88 wolfburg i have 75K on the motor since I rebuilt it haven't done anything 
to it . My 86 synco has 295K on it I have had it for only 2 years but again I 
haven't done anything to it. I use this van for towing a tow dolly, a couple 
of months ago towed Troy Wicals 78 from below asheville to Salem went over 3 
mountain ranges including Black Mountain, it was slow but had no problems. 
Some people seem to have more troubles than others, Like  Ray for example. On 
the head gaskets I have noticed that they are good for about 100K , its not a 
real bad job to do also, dont have to pull the engine to do this job. The 
motors are expensive to rebuild, and not just antbody seems capable of this 
job. The TIICO kit that I have seen are the best way to go.  later and have 
fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service  Salem  Va
