&gt;Ok, I've got some brand new tail light assemblies (housing, seal, &amp; =
lens)=20
&gt;and I cannot for the life of me figure out how to get these=20
&gt;installed.  There must be some kind of trick that I'm missing but I =
can't=20
&gt;seem to keep the housing installed in the groove in the rubber seal and =
at=20
&gt;the same time install the seal into the hole in the body (or vice =
versa,=20
&gt;install seal into body and then try to install housing into its =
groove).
