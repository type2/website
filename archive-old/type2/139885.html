&gt; Thank you all! With this info, I'll head over to the garage to talk
&gt; with the mechanic about the current state of the engine. I'm prepared
&gt; to do the work myself (providing that the bus fits into my
&gt; miniature-sized garage!) so now have to decide, with your info and
&gt; that of the mechanic, which route to take - replace engine, replace
&gt; heads, or machine the heads (are these my 3 options?)

doubt that the GEX heads are rebuildable.  would be surprised if they
didn't have cracks.   find a decent place to drop engine, take all the
&quot;Stuff&quot; off of it, send it off as a core to one of the better rebuilders
(check the archives, Boston Bob, AVP, NW Connecting rod seem to get good
reviews, I did my own with help of a local machinist, after my GEX seized
after 3,400 miles.)

&gt; Keep the advice coming, too, please! I really appreciate everyone's
&gt; quick and informative responses - it's nice to have sensible
&gt; information on an otherwise disappointing day!

good luck, sorry for the bad news about GEX

Bob
