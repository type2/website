For those of you who *want* to play with the late model stuff, you can 
check out the way these folks do it.  Considerably cheaper than $7,000
but you need a cheap laptop to go with it.

Lots more than just codes.....

&gt; &gt; &gt; You can buy low cost code readers. Mine cost $7000 and does a whole lot
&gt; &gt; &gt; more than just read codes. It has flat solved problems for me 3 times in
&gt; &gt; &gt; the last year that otherwise may have taken me a dozen hours to find.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Whew.. Well, if you make a living at it, and write off the depreciation or
&gt; &gt;loss on your taxes, that is one thing.. But few of us could afford a $7,000
&gt; &gt;meter, even if that is a &quot;cheap&quot;one.
&gt; 
&gt; The cheap ones are $150 to $300 and will readout on one manufactures codes. 
&gt; I am commercial, so depreciable. I charge $75 for hookup. This includes 
&gt; code readout and independent verification of all devices and circuits, as 
&gt; well as real time running parameters. My system is complete for all the 
&gt; Euro marks. It is compatible with 80's technology to date. Half the time 
&gt; you get one code that says &quot;rich/lean&quot;. I can tell that by pulling a spark 
&gt; plug, but more so, I can tell which it is, rich or lean. So a code read out 
&gt; alone won't do a thing for you many times. 90% of the time, the fault is 
&gt; founded in inadequate maintenance. Spark plugs or oxy sensors or filters 
&gt; loooong past due. I identify and resolve maintenance issues first, then 
&gt; readout the codes, then erase them, then do a running test to see if they 
&gt; reset. If they do reset, then I already know a whole bunch of things it is 
&gt; not, leaving far fewer things to diagnose. Want a readout without doing the 
&gt; maintenance first??? That's another shop. Good luck.
