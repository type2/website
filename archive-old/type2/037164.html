Subject: What's my bus worth ?

I see alot of busses for sale here so I guess it's alright to ask this.

I'm considering selling my bus and I need tho determine what would be a
realistic and fair asking price. Any feedback is appreciated.

It's a 1972 Type 2 bus Contempo camper conversion with a full high top
fiberglass roof, some call the whale top. Color is a brick red body and
a white top with windows on the roof sides and a roof vent.

The 1700cc engine was replaced in December 1999 with a rebuilt 2 litre
engine that came out of a 1976 bus; rebuilt by, purchased from and
installed by a local air cooled VW shop. The clutch size is the biggest
available but I forget what the specs are. It has two batteries.

I replaced the twin solex carbs with a new Weber two barrel progessive
and it starts instantly, hot or cold. The Solex's were re-bushed
recently and are in good shape and could be part of the deal at extra
cost or maybe not. What are they worth with all the linkage and tubes,
etc ?

The black front seats appear new, not recovered, and the dash, door
panels and everything else in front is almost perfect condition except
the cardboard kick panels behind the peddles could be nicer but not bad
at all and there is a small crack in the dash plastic.

The rear section is with a closet to the side of the custard yellow fold
down seat. Both came out of another camper. Typical VW application here.

The fridge, sink and stove are gone to free up space and weight. They
weren't in very good condition anyway. I still have the sink and stove
which are in good shape.

It has a small propane furnace that appears in good shape but it was
disconnected and moved to place a 1/4 sheet of plywood on the floor and
a new rug and I haven't hooked it up yet to try it out.

The fold down table is in good shape. The interior paneling is alright
but would look nicer with something newer. The overhead paneling and
insulation is new by me but still a work 
in progress, carpentry not being something I'm great at. 

I put in a new roof vent. The roof doesn't leak at all. Front and rear
overhead storage bays are in also started and coming along nicely. The
underside propane tank is there and I know it has some propane in it. 

It has a front mounted spare tire with a cover and the rear bumper has a
trailer hitch with ball. The side door appears the have new
carrige/slider/hardware and works smoothly.

The windshield was new before I got it and all the other glass is
perfect.

I think the transmission is new or rebuilt. It has that &quot;new&quot; look to
it. Some previous owner(s) has put alot of improvements into this van
and it shows so I don't doubt that the tranny and alot of other things
have been replaced.

The body and paint is near perfect except for minor nicks and small
scratches and one small shopping cart dent to the right front corner by
the headlight.

The rear brake shoes were replaced last week and I was told by the VW
shop that the front disk pads are good. I haven't pulled the wheels to
check them.

Heater and everything electrical works. Tires are good but not new.

About the only thing it needs that I've noticed is the right front door
seal has a small section missing and the hubcaps and rims are beginning
to rust. I live next to the ocean in San Francisco.

I have repair and parts receipts going back four or five owners and the
the original German shipping document/invoice delivering it to Texas.

It's strong, fast and very reliable and I get frequent compliments about
it from strangers.

What did I leave out ?

Anyway, I'm guessing but would $3500 be too much to ask or not enough ?


Thanks for any guidance here.
