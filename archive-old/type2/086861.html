&gt; &lt;&lt; The check list looks good I would advise you to loose the fix-a-flat. That
&gt; stuff is really bad. It also contains flammable material which I have
&gt; personally seen explode at a tire shop while getting new tire mounted.  &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Any feedback on &quot;Slime&quot; pre-puncture sealant...A buddy of mine uses it
&gt; on his strictly farm-used pickup and swears by it. Just curious about
&gt; street use...

wouldn't touch the stuff with a ten foot pole, would drive on the flat
first, it does less damage to the tire!!!!  (and I know from first hand
experience)
