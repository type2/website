Subject: Clanking noise coming from the back....
Date: Mon, 4 Dec 2000 16:24:10 -0000 
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I have just started to experience a clanking noise coming from the back of
the van - it is only present when the van is moving and gets faster as the
van gets faster - I cannot see anything visually wrong wither under the van
or around the wheels or in the engine.

Has anyone got any idea what this could be ?

Cheers for any help.
