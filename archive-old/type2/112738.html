Subject: Re: [T2] main #4 bearing dowel pin loose

hehehe.. I think I'm gonna stop by rimco to have them check it out.  I think
my #4 crank bearing is shot.. which means I'll probably have to get my crank
checked out/reground.  fun fun!

&gt; Go to a machinist and get them to help you (larger pin base, normal head
&gt; size) and if you are going to trash the case send it to me... I can always
&gt; use a spare.
