Subject: Fix that suicude cabinet on your westies
Message-Id: &lt;199905031942.MAA18207_at_pdxss101.pdx.intel_dot_com&gt;

&gt;years to look for.  The one thing I advise *strongly* against is going
&gt;to the 68-73 westy settup.  The stock settup for those years includes 
&gt;full-height cabinet behind the passenger seat allong the reare quarter.
&gt;this cabinet creates a *huge* blind spot that IMHO is dead flat unsafe. 
&gt;I have a '73 and call it the &quot;suicide cabinet&quot;.

I've got this set up as well.  If I ever get around to putting the axels and
rear tin back on so I can drive my bus, here are my plans...

A year or so ago I met a fella at the coast with a similar set up and he
showed me what he did.  He basically turned the &quot;closet&quot; section into a low
cabinet.  Took a sawz-all and removed the top portion of the cabinet, right
at the level where it would (and does) make a great armrest for anyone
sitting in the seat.  Said he did not even have to remove the cabinet from
the bus.  I sat in the drivers seat, and it opened that blind spot right
up.
