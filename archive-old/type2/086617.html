Subject: 78' Westy Stool Wanted

Anyone have the correct stool for a 78' that they want to part with? I
think it goes between the front seats and maybe there is a small trash can
too? Anyone know about this stuff? Also is this what the two plastic
buckle/like pieces are for that are on the front seat pedestals in between?
They look just like the ones on the dash that hold the small table that
goes there.
