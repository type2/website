Subject: Recommended carburetion for a 1776?

Hello...
	I am inquiring of the list collective as to which carb would be good
for a daily driver 1776... in regard to reliability. 
	This particular engine is now fitted with CB Performance's CFI system,
but I have never have worked all of the bugs out of it... and I'm tired
of checking and rechecking the electrical specs to find that they are to
spec, and sending the FI brain to CB only to have the works repeat their
previous problems of hard starting upon return. I am *over* the wild
goose chase and would like to be able to get my friend on the road
without further ado...
	This particular engine is a 1776cc, with _at_6.7:1 CR, stock DP heads,
stock camshaft, a 009 distributor with a Compufire unit (oh, no.. the
009 flames again...), and an extractor-esque dual-QP exhaust system... 
	The only relevant piece of info I've gleaned so far from the Archives
is a distributor's recommendation of a Weber single 40... and the fact
that stock solexes missing the accompanying emissions equipment have
terrible flat spots. 
	Any suggestions on appropriate carburetors/sellers and their initial
jetting for this type of setup are more than welcome.

Thanks.
