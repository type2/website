Subject: Re: [T2] Rocker arm studs and me :-(

I just went out there with a q-tip just to poke around in the stud
hole and see what I can see.

There is no threadlocking compound whatsoever in there.
The threads seem in fine shape and the q-tip only brought some dirty
oil out.   No shavings.   There were no shavings on the stud when I
extracted it just a few little flecks of aluminum.

Unfortunately I munged up the top threads necessitating a complete replacement.

my adjustment screws aren't too bad, but then again I don't know what
is and isn't good.  They look good n fat, the heads while they show
signs of wear...They don't look nasty, I'll measure them tomorrow to
see if they are the bigger ones.

I am going to start with Northwest Connecting Rod as I think they are
going to be the only local resource that will have the part I need.

I'll post more when I get more info.
