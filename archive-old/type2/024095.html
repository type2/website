Adam,

The answer to ths is simple.

Drain the tank daily.

If your blowing this much water, the air tank must be full of
condensation, and it's blowing more water, than the filter can handle. 

Ae you running the air hose right off the compressor?

If yes, change that.

Run a stand pipe verticly off the tank, and connect the air line up
higher, will also the water down to your air tools.

I run and air dryer, at the end of the stand pipe at the compressor, and
at the end of the supply hose, just before the tool supply line.

Just be sure you drain the tank at the compressor till all the water is
out of it.

Later,
