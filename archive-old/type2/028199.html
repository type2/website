Hi Folks,

Well, it's Friday and you early Bay folks have been chatting about how early 
your Buses are.  How about late Buses?  Does anybody out there have one of 
the LAST Bays?

Sweet Pea is a relatively early 1979 Westy, vin 2392 056372.  My M-code 
plate has a 47 5 order date, which is late-November (11/24) 1978.

Anybody have a later Bay?

Happy Friday!

Jason Upper
1979 Westy &quot;Sweet Pea&quot;
