Subject: Re: [T2] I really need help, folks - - Bosch plugs,Dr Tim, and synch the carbs

If you need bosch, check PEP boys.  Its the primary brand using about 
60% of the stock.  I think the new number for bosch is 7504.  Bosch has 
been changing part numbers.

&gt;
&gt; Put a set of Bosch W8CC in and all is well.  Once
&gt; again the Captain learns not to cheap out.
&gt; (Actually the autolite's were slightly more
&gt; expensive, but they were the only one's FLAPS had
&gt; in stock.)  I usually take Dr. Tim's bosch only
&gt; advice with reservation.  And as usual, he's
&gt; snickering at me.
