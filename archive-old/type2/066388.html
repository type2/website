Subject: Warranty hassles

The bus I recently bought came with a &lt; 2000 mile engine in it, still 
under warranty with the local mechanic who rebuilt it. Whilst checking it 
out, I discovered that compression in #3 is only 90 lbs, the other 3 all 
&gt;= 120.

So, I had the mechanic check it out, and his story is: &quot;If you used cheap 
gas (87 octane), then the piston could overheat, and this would not be 
covered by warranty. I'll pull the engine and fix it, but if it's not our 
fault, then you pay.&quot;

I could do the work myself (I've built a 1600 DP before, with pretty good 
results), but thought I'd cash in on the warranty. What experiences have 
you all had along these lines? What can he reasonably say that will make 
this my problem?

I guess the answer is really that I need to do the work myself, because 
he will probably come up with some excuse to charge me $400 for whatever 
it is he finds. Just looking for more opinions.

Thanks!
