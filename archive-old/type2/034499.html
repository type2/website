Subject: Suddenly no power...

List,

My '78 2 liter FI Westy suddenly has decided to lose power on me. 
Thankfully, it chose to do this after it passed emissions...

Symptoms:  Starts fine when cold, for the first time ever, it starts
poorly when warmed up.  Initial power is smooth, no backfiring but
has no power after mid-rpms.  Top speed is now about 50 mph in fourth
and it takes a looong time to get there.

Possibilities:  I checked the fuel filter, seems ok.  Battery ok.  The
only thing I've done recently was to add a can of dry gas and I used the
Westy to jump-start my Audi (after letting a battery charger do the initial
chores).  Any ideas?? Fuel pump, fried something in the ignition or brain??

Any and all ideas appreciated, I'll post the results.

TIA,
Craig in CO
'78 Westies
