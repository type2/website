This sounds like a lack of fuel. I'm not really savvy with gasoline engines, 
Diesel is my trade, but it really sounds like a fuel problem. I'd start out 
with a fuel additive and then go from there, I'm having trouble with my &quot;5th 
injector&quot; myself, so everytime I fill up I add a bottle of heet to my fuel. 
plus it never hurts to carry a can of starting fluid. Just don't do anything 
major first, make sure you start out with the most simple of troubleshooting. 
It will save time and money.
