Subject: date codes, vins etc

Hey gang - got a post from Clara, but thought I'd post my response to the
group for the heck of it.

&gt;- - -
&gt;sorry - what is the logic behind it not being the date code? and where
&gt;does 64 come in?

&gt;clara

Clara- the logic was as follows... I've been trolling Net pages, archives,
postings et al; a few folks (ok, janello;&gt;) claimed that &quot; 06 4 &quot; would
mean a manu date of June 64 ie, last date being year. They were obviously
wrong. Which is what I was trying to find out. Your answer seems most
likely, but I still am disturbed by some things. The NEATO folks told me
that VWAG &quot;started quoting the manu dates one day off ever since they
stopped being able to tell you mcode and paint code numbers.&quot; Two things:
one day off of 5/5/65 is *not* April 6. So this remains a mystery. And two,
VWAG reported that my 70 was built in October 69; this matches the sticker
attached to my driver's side door pillar. Which means that VWAG is CORRECT
in this instance, but not in the other... discrepancies like that bug me.
And where in the heck would I find the manu dates on the 70 mcode plate?
There is no &quot;10,&quot; no &quot;69,&quot; not even the letter code for months that one
sender suggested (N for Nov, etc... why would they make October &quot;E?&quot;) Did
they change the code system again with the loafs? Argh. I'm being such a
pest about this because I've found Volkswageneers often take the Lore as
gospel, and its DAMN hard to get someone to think twice about a 'fact'
someone told them at a swapmeet! I've been getting three answers to every
question, and this just seems to be a really important little tidbit to get
straight. I think a good experiment would be to have as many listers as
possible send their VIN# to VWAG (quote it at least TWICE to avoid pesky
mistakes!), and then compare VW's info with what we BELIEVE to be correct.
The VW email site is http://www.vw-online_dot_de/mail/kontakt.htm .The page is
in German, but its very easy to figure out. This would help the NEATO
folks' research into port codes, if nothing else! By all means, if any one
in the peanut gallery has other opinions, web pages with info, etc, let me
know. Maybe Ken can then put together a complete archive with all paint,
date, port and mcodes we can find?
