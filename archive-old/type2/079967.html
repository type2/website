Subject: Missing email address: Late Westy tire cabinet screw thingie

A few weeks ago I was talking to someone about finding that screw knob that
holds the spare tire cabinet closed -- they needed one. Tonight, while
cleaning the workbench I found it, but I don't know who to send it to.

Whoever you are, step forward and claim your prize or else it goes back in
the nuts/bolts bin!
