Subject: RE: Winter gas mileage

I want to thank everyone for the responses, both public and private.  I got
too many to respond to individually.  In summary:

The overwhelming majority of respondants indicated that they too see lower
mileage in the winter than in the summer.  Besides the chokes working
harder and possible &quot;weaker&quot; gas, other reasons given included thicker
oils, increased use of lights and heater, and longer engine warmup time.

My mileage doesn't seem to be all that bad after all.  Many reported
similar or even lower mileage than what I am getting.

30 degrees F is not *really* winter.  Yes, I know this.  :)  But all you
cold weather people know you love it, so stop yer whinin and go build a
snowman or something.  :)

US$20 is cheap for a tank of gas.  I should not have complained - I realize
that a lot of people on the list are paying way more, and I do empathize.
It's too bad that the governments of those countries (and states) insist on
taxing gasoline to the extent that they do.

Happy Holidays to everyone,

-David
