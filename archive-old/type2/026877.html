And NO not the Star Trek Dr. Spock.... the one that wrote the famous medical 
book that was a staple for it's time... yes he was later disproved and wrong 
on many things, but he had good information for the time... same with Muir.

Also look at it this way... can YOU do better ?

old Native American saying... I will not criticize my fellow man until I 
walk in his moccasins !
