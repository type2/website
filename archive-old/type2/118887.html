Subject: Rehash piston/cylinders for sale

Is anyone interested in those 2L pistons/cylinders that I have for sale?

BTW, my &quot;new&quot; neighbor (they moved from an ice storm damaged mobile home in
our neighborhood to one across the street from my place) has a mini-camper,
sort of a van/camper combo, that I was very surprised to see was a VW
Rialta.  I didn't know that VW made a camper.
