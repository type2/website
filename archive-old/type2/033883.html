Dear Craig,

The only way I know of to find out what to do about the tour is to contact
Leo Soderman at lsoderman_at_worldnet.att_dot_net. It's been my experience that Leo
won't contact you until it's very near your time to handoff unless you
e-mail him with questions. As far as I know, Joy McMahan has handed off to
Marv Krupp in Burnsville, NC this last Sunday. From there I have no idea how
far it has traveled. To date, the souvenir box and the hubcap are all that
you need to carry :-) There is a one use camera in the souvenir box, and
you're supposed to take one photo of the handoff with that and put it back
in the box until the film is used up. After that, ask Leo :-).  I used my
own digital camera and a polaroid to do the shots I put up on the web and
the ones I have sent to Leo. So that part is pretty much up to you.

Hope this helps,

Chris and Gus in Atlanta

&gt; The Great Bus Tour Baton, that is... I know it is in the SEast, and should
&gt; go north and then south again, but the web page hasn't been updated in 3
&gt; months.
&gt; Also, could someone clue us down-winders what all we are getting into and
&gt; what to bring? It sounds like we'll have busses full of stuff to transfer,
&gt; what with cameras, tapes, souvenir boxes and what not :)
