Subject: Re: [T2] My first Bus Depot order

Paul &amp; List,
I, too made my first Depot order a week ago, 4 fold-down cup holders.
 Though considerably smaller, my order arrived within 3 days, much better
than7-10 days, I'd say.  I'm quite pleased, and I foresee spending more
of my dead presidents with Bus Depot.

So far I have had exemplary service from Aircooled_dot_net, Old Volks, and
Bus Depot.  Again, more of my cash will definitely be flowing in those
directions.  As soon as I have need to, I'll be tapping BustedBUS for
duty as well.  Support the listees, I say.

BTW Ron, these cupholders are waaaayyy better than any of those RV Made
In ??? caca holders.  A friend is making me a new center console, which
will incorporate these new cupholders recessed into the face, I'll be
sure to post pics online.

Later,

Simon Ramirez Jr.

&gt; With all the recent/ continuing talk about Bus Depot's shipping speed,
&gt; I thought this might be relevant.  Some people have had good experiences
&gt; and some bad.  I have always been one to make my own decision about
&gt; things like this, especially when opinions vary so greatly.  So, with
&gt; good spirit in mind and credit card in hand, I picked up the phone
&gt; and placed the order.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Ordering was easy.  Will it arrive in the &quot;promised&quot; 7-10 days?  We
&gt; shall see.
&gt; 
&gt; more to come....
