Subject: Re: Gas Heaters According to Kath  :-)

So Emily Hanlon says:
&gt; &gt;Well, don't answer, 'cause while I was writing this I called Joe at JB
&gt; &gt;and he was REAL polite (and remembers you well, Kath!) and told me they draw
&gt; &gt;6 amps.  That's alot, and this would only be suitable on a second battery.
&gt; 
&gt; Before I get flamed, let me say I only know what I learned in my high
&gt; school physics class about electricity (aka- not much at all).  Does Her
&gt; Majesty require a second battery?  Is this such a big deal?  Should I even
&gt; worry about it?  For some reason, I don't want to put another battery in,
&gt; but for that kind of heat and considering I don't have a camper either,
&gt; this is really exciting.  I guess I'm just glad to know there are a lot
&gt; more options on heat than I originally thought-

Please keep in mind that Kath said that they only use it while driving
and not while camping.  So why do you need a second battery?  I had a
chance to talk extensively with Kathy and Mark during the second Sequoia
Nat. Forest CCC trip and we both agreed that it would not be suitable at
all for stationary camping use.  Too noisy and too much exhaust.

Get the Propex one.  Well worth the money...
