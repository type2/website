	Archives, asked   to remove

Volks,

Stephen has carried our archive for several years, and built the search
engine that all of us use when our buses are broken. He gave us a home for
the archive at a time when we had severe bandwidth constraints and nobody
else would take it, and since then he's provided what I personally consider
to be one of the most important bus resources in the world. The service he
has provided of his own time, at his own expense, has been beyond measure.

Many of us who are bus idiots (I include myself) have got buses back running
because that archive is there. It is invaluable.

Recently on the vintagebus list, Stephen floated the idea of distributing
the full archive on CD-ROM or other media.

Stephen does understand that that would indisputably violate copyright law.
He is also aware that it would break the promise we make in writing to each
new subscriber of each list, that we will not republish or sell your
messages because you own your words, we don't.

However, despite repeated attempts, I have not been able to get from him a
commitment that he will not distribute the archives on hard media.

This puts us (&quot;us&quot; here means &quot;people who could get sued&quot;) in a position of
exposure if we continue to be associated with Stephen's archive at i405_dot_com.
I know for a fact that lawyers were deployed during the infamous copyright
flap that was centered at a certain other VW site a few years ago. I don't
need that, the other admins don't need it, the subscribers don't need it,
and it has the potential to destroy the lists.

It also would flout the commitment we've made to the subscribers and the
integrity we've established as a resource over the years. There are some
things we've historically held sacrosanct--we don't sell your email
addresses, we don't run ads, the lists will always be free, and we don't
pretend to own your messages. All that stuff. Those of you who are
old-timers know the drill. =^ )

For these reasons, I've disabled the links at www.type2_dot_com which point to
i405_dot_com. I also requested that Stephen take his archive off-line and he
agreed to do so.

We'll try to have a new serviceable archive on-line as soon as possible.

GDTRFB. There is nothing good to be said about this.
