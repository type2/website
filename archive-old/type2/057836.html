Subject: Clutch Problem

Mighty List:

Last night my clutch did an ominous thing:  Just after firing up my 1980
Vanagon Westfalia (Van Glorious the WryBreadBox), I tried to get into 1st
gear and I absolutely couldn't slide the stickshift into position.  It was
like something was blocking the linkage.  I couldn't get into any other
gear either.  I stopped the engine, started it back up, and voila, I could
get in.  Then driving home there was some resistance getting into the gears
sometimes.  This morning I got right into gear, but I'm still worried.

Is there anything obvious that I should be looking at? Some fluids or
something? I'm driving 600 miles to Burning Mann tomorrow (Saturday)
morning, so any help would be a load off my mind.

Thanks hugely,

Hugh Mann
