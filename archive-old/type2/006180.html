Background. Bought a 68 DC off the net last fall, for $300. AAA hauled it
here to WNC; found an adaptor and put installed the bug engine that had been
sitting in the bed...total of from 5-11 years.., tried to fire up once. Coil
overheated, no spark. Literally the next day had to go to Fla for the
half-year (our method of avoiding the no-heat problem with busses), and too
busy this spring to look at it.

OK, last week decided to spend the 5 minutes on the no spark problem, and
crank her up. hee hee hee. A myriad of small problems arose...each easy..but
time consuming. Plus, unlike last fall with the jumper caples, a bucket of
gas and shorting out the starter terminals :), decided to have key
made..from # off drivers door handle (thanks list), kinda clean out the gas
tank, replace most fuel hoses, put in a 009 for right now...stock was
troublesome, and assorted other preps, tried to fire yesterday. It would
fire when gas poured in carb only, run 4-5 seconds. Talked to KVS a lot,
read archives and manuals, FINALLY, doh, figured it was the fuel pump.
Pushrod was 1/4&quot; extended vs 1/2&quot; ie, insufficient stroke.

FLAPS here in mountains &quot;couldn't order a pushrod&quot;, so bought an electric
today, and while at it, cleaned regulator contacts and grounds and tried to
polarize the generator...green lite had stayed on during 5 sec &quot;runs&quot;.

Tonight, made first real attempt to start sleeping beauty here...and she
runs! So nice to see a long abandoned Vdubb crank again. Despite some
exhaust leaks..broken studs and the whole rear tin/bumpers/etc are pulled
off right now..it sounds pretty good. Had been thinking &quot;temp engine&quot; just
to be able to move it to sandblaster/etc,,but MAY be a keeper.

For the record..this thing, tho' a beastie now..has potential as the
interior, tho dirty..is in almost primo condition, and the gates are
definitely salvagable. Next on agenda..make it stop. Then windshield..then
start driving it, be properly embarrased by it's roughness..and get to body
work.

Bottom line: Vdub engines are pretty fine, to sit in a ditch all those
years, and with minimal fuss, purr right up again.

For DocRic (who owned this truck years ago): Still got that windshield? If
so, I'll be comin' over the mountain next week. No, not in this thing,
silly!
