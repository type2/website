I know this isnt a VW subject.

But for anyone who likes to know what kind of bus Gabe saw i have here a
link to a page full of these busses. They look a bit like our VW busses but
are bigger in dimensions. But when you see one driving by on the streets and
it is quickly gone before you take a good look you might think it is some
kind of crappy conversion of a type 2  bus.

Okay, here is the link http://home.knuut_dot_de/319erufi/319erclub.html

&gt; I have them narrowed down to the 319D with was produced some time around
&gt; the late 50s and 60s.
&gt;
&gt; I also seem to remember they are 4 wheel drive.
