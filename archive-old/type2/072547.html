Hello list,

The heads are refurbished, the new pistons and cylinders, pushrod tubes and gaskets are poised and ready.....Yes, it is time to reassemble the 78 2.0 Liter Type IV.  I am seeking advice regarding types of lubricants, sealers etc involved during the assembly process.  Any warnings, tricks and tips anyone has that might not be covered clearly in the mighty manuals would be greatly appreciated.  I keep worrying about leaving out some small key piece that will  ruin my engine upon startup.  Any good tin schematics out there showing all pieces and proper placement?

Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.

Chad
