Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] VW Bus story in Tucson paper...

Hey! I really enjoyed that! And check this out!...

&quot;Of course, our main focus is to sell new cars, but we're aware that our
brand has a unique heritage,&quot; said Christian Bokich, spokesman for
Volkswagen's U.S. headquarters in Auburn Hills, Mich. &quot;We're certainly
grateful for that love people have for our brand.&quot;

So, could it be that the circle is unbroken and all old wounds have healed?
And we now welcomed back as prodigal autokinder into the family fold of
Volkswagen, Inc.? Ach du liebe, Augustine! VWunderbar!
