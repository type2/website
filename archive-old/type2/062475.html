I was having one heckuva time adjusting my sping plates on my '71 Westy.
 Specifically, I couldn't get the spring plate to stay back on the lower stop
after I adjusted the spring plate on the torsion bar.

That all changed after I met a wise man in the junk yard this morining.  Mr.
Billy Manley, VW expert of 25 years, revealed to me an ancient Chinese
secret.  It's called once you jack the spring plate up and bang the top of
the plate onto the torsion bar spline, you jam a phillips head screwdriver
into one of the cover plate holes and push the cover down until you can start
one of your four screws.  After that the rest of the screws are easier to
start....  &gt;&gt;&gt; 

I just went to my FLAPS (NAPA), bought a couple of longer screws and brought
everything together with the wrench, put the regular length screws in -- and
did the same on the other side.  The cover plates I have worked with wouldn't
budge for a Phillips head screwdriver or anything else powered by me ;-)  Oh,
 put the longer screws in holes diagonally opposite from each other.  A
little talc on the rubber donuts helps things go together.
