Yes, the type 4/pancake motors will let you pull the tubes through
the heads.  

Next, the O-rings and head pan gaskets come in a full set from any VW
dealership.  My local one was quite reasonable on the price, but that was
10 years ago when I changed out the seals on mine. &lt;G&gt;

Also, I sparingly used some orange RTV (after cleaning up the block 
and head sealing areas) and put them back in.  Not a leak ever since!

&gt; Once more I ask for you very good help.  When I was in Miami last month,
&gt; I purchased from Andres Imported Parts a set of O´rings for the push rod
&gt; tubes.  As I recall from the guy that sold me the van, these push rods
&gt; could come out without removing the heads, just removing the rocker
&gt; arms, the rods and that was it. . . .   is this true ??.  The oil is
&gt; leaking more and more and is pooring on the heaters and is smoking  so
&gt; much that every time I stop it gets  inside the car.   I could use any
&gt; advise.
