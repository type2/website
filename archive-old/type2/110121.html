&lt;&lt; The reason I chose to ignore them were as follows - having decided to 
drive an aircooled vw (especially type 2) it was already clear in my mind that 
clean air was not my biggest priority &gt;&gt;

Its good that you are clear in stressing that for you_personally_driving a 
type 2 and placing low priority on clean air are related.  For many type 2 
owners, it is quite the opposite.  My 79 westy passes the tests here in Oregon with 
plenty of room to spare because it is well maintained and all emmission 
control systems are in place.

Driving a type 2 and placing priority on clean air are not mutually 
exclusive, its a personal decision to make them so.
