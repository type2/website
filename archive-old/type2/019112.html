Hi Nikki
Welcome back.  I followed your travels from the posts.
The valve adjustment could well be off if you adjust the valves using
the distributor as a reference for finding TDC (top dead center).  There
should be marks on the crankshaft pulley to help you find it for #1 &amp; #3
cylinders.  There may or may not be marks for #2 &amp; 4.  When you use the
distributor and your timing is off you could well set your valves too
loose.  I don't see how they could be set tight using the distributor as
a reference.  It's of to use the distributor to see which cylinder
you're coming up on for adjustment but after that crank pulley marks are
the way to go.

I'm not expelling noxious fumes about mechanics knowledge, just pointing
out the obvious.  BTW how DID they clean threads and install inserts
without removing the heads first to keep the metal particles out of the
cylinder or did they?)?
Dave
