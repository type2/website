&gt; &gt; My main question here is about the spare tire mount on the nose.  From
&gt; &gt; reading the archives, the general concensus seems to be (1) in event of a
&gt; &gt; collision the front of the bus is very susceptible to damage, and (2)
&gt; sheet
&gt; &gt; metal alone is not really strong enough to support the weight.
&gt; &gt; There's been a few different ideas about supporting the mount better.
&gt; What
&gt; &gt; does the group think about this idea:  mounting it as indicated, then
&gt; welding
&gt; &gt; supports on each side down to the bumper.
&gt; 
&gt; I've had a couple of '71 Westy's with the front tire mount (installed by
&gt; previous owners). Never had a problem with any of them. I like having the
&gt; tire out of the bed area to give my 6'5&quot; 240# body a little more room to
&gt; stretch out. The tire well is covered with masonite and foam to extend the
&gt; bed. Also, the well is a handy place to store my tool roll right by the
&gt; engine compartment. For your rig, which I suppose has the full width bench
&gt; seat, you can come up with all sorts of storage ideas. I don't think that
&gt; extra supports to the bumper are necessary nor desirable. Others have
&gt; reported troubles with the front tire mounts, but I like the fact that I
&gt; don't have to worry about miscreants stealing my VW emblem.
