Subject: Re: Fitting a 34PICT3 on a 1600DP With alternator

OK. 

I tried repositioning the offending linkage plate and adjuster to the
3 other possible positions in which it would fit. 2 of the positions
placed the hole for the linkage above the throttle shaft where I could
not attach the connecting rod. The other configuration place the hole
on the bottom, toward the accelerator pump. I believe this must be the
position to which you are refereing. The problem here is that when the
throttle shaft turns the linkage won't move enough to actuate the
pump. There's more of an up-down movement on the throttle linkage as
opposed to an foward-back movement.

Maybe I'm missing something.

Anyone know where I can get just the linkage(s) I need?

thanks

peace

 Loosen off the nut
&gt; on the throttle shaft, take the little hair pin clip off of the rod, if I
&gt; remember correctly. The offending accel pump linkage part pulls off. Then,
&gt; you flip it over. Thus, the offending part is at the top instead of the
&gt; bottom.
