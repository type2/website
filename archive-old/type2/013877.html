Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Tank Question



&gt; I plan to install a complete 1978 L-Jetronic fuel injection system 
into my
&gt; 74 loaf. I was able to purchase everything from the donor with 
exception of
&gt; the fuel tank. I currently have a non-FI tank that I; cleaned, 
etched, and
&gt; polymer coated. I would like to be able to keep this tank, but as read
&gt; through the archives there seems to be no other optons aside from 
brazing a
&gt; fuel return port into my current tank or purchasing a used good used 
FI
&gt; tank. I am going to throw out a couple of ideas to the &quot;Bouncing 
Wall&quot;: #1
&gt; Could I possibly run the fuel return line to one of the top vent 
ports on my
&gt; tank? #2 Would it be possible to add a T-fitting to the standard fuel 
port
&gt; on the bottom of the tank? I've tried Miller Fuel Injection (thanks 
Mark)
&gt; and
&gt; they offer a sump kit which is a little cost prohibitive at $149.

I don't see any major problem with returning it to the vent lines as 
long as you make sure that all liquid fuel goes into the tank and not 
into the vent system.  A vertical loop of line on the vent side of the 
return would probably do the trick.
