&gt; Thanks for the advice.  WeatherPop tells me &quot;Tue - Fair&quot;, so hopefully
&gt; I'll be able to seal it up in a couple of days (last year's bathroom
&gt; repairs lead me to believe that I'll have better luck if I wait for the
&gt; rain to stop and the surface to dry a little :-)

Read the instructions and make sure you use something that will cure at
these low temperatures. I did a similar repair on my windshield long before
I had it done right at the bodyshop...

My seal had become so old that it had cracked in the corners, shrunk and
dried out. I caulked it between the seal and the body and it worked well. I
used a silicone (probably not the best stuff) but it went on white and cured
clear so it wasn't an eyesore.

When it rained hard, the rain stopped coming in under the seal it started
coming in through the seal (between the glass and seal) and I had to run a
line around the glass. I did in when it was too cold and it didn't cure
properly. When it got really rainy and cold it turned from clear to white.

Luckily summer came, the rain stopped and the bodywork was completed in
July.

&gt; I'm pretty sure the metal is OK.  I don't see any rust when I look down
&gt; at the sagging area (though I can see some at the bottom of the
&gt; windshield, but this is hardly unusual for s Bus, and it appears to be
&gt; minor).

That's what everyone says. ;-) Where there's rust there's more rust.

What sucks is that it's better to leave it as is and not disturb the
windshield area of the body until you are ready to fix it right. If your
windshield cracks and you are forced to replace it you may find out what I
mean.
