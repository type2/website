Subject: Re: [T2] re: shipping between USA and Europe - Opportune Lift!

&lt;Sorry for such a long post, but I wanted to hear the crying  ! ! !&gt;

The tears are shorting out my keyboard!!! &lt;griN!&gt; 

We hauled cars back and forth to Cuba and Puerto Rcio while I was onboard the USS Ashland. Not a bad way to go and yes, a bit slow. On a side note when they shipped my Beetle back from Italy the paint job was a mess. On the paperwork there is a page where they indicate damages before they move it. I had marks ALL over the car's picture. Finally they just circled the whole car... One big 4 weeled scrape... 

Another time on the Ashland we hauled about 3500 Cuban refugees... Sank alot of &quot;boats&quot; but no amphibious vintage American vehicles or Volkswagens... 

$150 is a GREAT price. Anyone want to ship me a Fiat 500?

'78 Westy 2,7L - the &quot;ULTIMATE&quot; Navy Sailor's transportation - travel, sleep, hang-out, cook-out, etc. etc. etc. 

Unfortunately I figured that out 15 minutes after I bought my first Westy, and that was 2 years after I returned to civilian life...
