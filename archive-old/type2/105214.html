&gt;Yup.  See the bentley manual.

Bentley doesn't say anything about sitting someone in the driver's seat before measuring the angle of the body...In the archives it says:

&gt;The easiest way to check your bus is to park it on a level surface, open the
&gt;sliding door, put a carpenter's level on the door sill, put a driver in the driver's
&gt;seat, and read the level. If it is close to level your suspension is fine. (I'm
&gt;assuming that you have equal-sized tires all around, of course!) Buses
&gt; normally sit a bit nose-high without a driver in the driver's seat. 

If I look at any brochure from 1968 era the nose doesn't seem high to me. I've seen this many times on a bus with a sagging rear end but not in those picture of a new bus

What gives?
