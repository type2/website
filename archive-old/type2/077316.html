Subject: Re: [T2] 2.0L in a '70???

From: Nigel A. Skeet
Reply to: naskeet_at_hotmail_dot_com

In Great Britain, a 2.0 L Type 4 engine was fitted by Arthur Baraclough into 
his 1970 VW Type 2. I believe he used the standard crankshaft driven fan, 
but did have to modify the engine bay surround. This van travelled about 
250,000 miles through several deserts, over mountain ranges and is now 
reputed to be in the Peter Black Museum, in Yorkshire.

His van has many inovative features (including exhaust-heated, domestic hot 
water system, double glazed windows and engine starting handle), all of 
which Arthur fitted himself.

Sadly, he died in mid-1996, at the age of about 83, having driven his van 
almost upto the time of his death. I corresponded with him briefly, during 
late 1995 and early 1996, shortly after I joined the British VW Type 2 
Owners Club, which currently has about 2,500 fully paid up members.

Regards.

Jake Raby said that

&gt;The 2.0 L Type 4 engine will not fit without converting it to upright, and 
&gt;fabricating a
&gt;new type of Mustache bar for the application..Of all the vehicles A T IV 
&gt;can
&gt;be installed into, this one is the roughest.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; The subject line says it all.... will a 2.0L FI engine and transmission
&gt;fit
&gt; &gt; into a '70 bus?
