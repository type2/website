Subject: Re: [T2] 73-79 Rim size?

TONS of this info in the archives... 

14&quot; for all baywindow busses. Starting in 1971 I think they went from the &quot;Wide-5&quot; lug pattern to a 5x112mm pattern.

Because your next question &lt;grin!&gt; will be where can you get 15&quot; wheels or whatelse fits - look at Mercedes (fits with right offset), Audi/Eurovan/Passat (dubious offset), Vanagon (good - but don't think VW sold 15&quot; wheels, just aluminum 14&quot; wheels). 

I have a set of 15&quot; Mercedes BBS rims I got from eBarf for a good price. 15&quot; rims are not popular on Mercedes so these are not desireable to those folks, they want 16&quot; and 17&quot; rims. 

www.gowesty_dot_com has some options, and several of the online tire suppliers (i.e. Tire Rack, Discount Tires) will sell you Mercedes rims. Just don't tell them what you are going to put them on... They don't want the liability when you put these rims on something they don't agree with. Check the Mercedes specs, some that these wheels fits are as heavy or heavier than our vans. I think they will be fine.
