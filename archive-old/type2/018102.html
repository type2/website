&gt; &gt;Well, yeah, maybe $200 in parts is reasonable.... But, then again I didn't
&gt; &gt;do the work myself. Brakes are something that if you don't get right the
&gt; &gt;first time, there may be no second chance. I didn't feel comfortable doing
&gt; &gt;it myself.
&gt; 
&gt; Hmmm... that's exactly the reason that I don't feel comfortable having
&gt; someone else do it.  I don't like putting my life in other people's hands
&gt; any more than necessary.  I don't want to be a jerk about it and I
&gt; appreciate your reasoning, but the brake repair places love to scare people
&gt; with stories of total brake failure and I've heard that quote about &quot;no
&gt; second chance&quot; more than once.  Truth is there are lots and lots of things
&gt; that can go wrong with a vehicle which can kill you if you're going 60mph -
&gt; wheels, tires, bearings, axles, suspension, steering, etc.. but there seems
&gt; to be this stigma with brakes.  Visions of careening down a mountain road,
&gt; busting through the guuardrail and over a cliff.  :)  If my brakes ever
&gt; fail,  I'll just drop it into a low gear and try to hit something cheap.  :)

David:
I agree 100%! And earlier this year I found out that a Vanagon doesn't
steer too well when one wheel falls off (I didn't do it but it happened
on my watch, and I did tell my wife that rattle was probably a CV
joint).
Luckily, no major damage and a lesson well learned.
Steering and tires are more important than brakes!
