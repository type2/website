&gt; Do these digital calipers draw power even when off? Mine says it is ready for a new battery again...

&gt; Otherwise good caliper for my needs. Checks out well against really good ones at work.

Don't know.  The first battery (chinese SR-44) lasted two years of
intermittant use.

The one thing that my digital caliper does that my old vernier caliper
can't is to allow me to take a blind reading.  You put the caliper in
place, press the zero button, remove the caliper, push the jaws together,
and read the negative reading as positive.

OTOH, the vernier caliper never needs a battery!
