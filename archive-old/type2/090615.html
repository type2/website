Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Seized

.....
The following is not intended as Monday Morning Quarterbacking, but as
a heads-up to others out there.........

If you must install an oil pressure gauge, please install the pressure
sender
IN ADDITION TO, NOT IN PLACE OF the stock, idiot-light sender.  That way,
if you don't believe what the gauge says, or it malfunctions, you still
have the
idiot-light to save your ass, poor engine, marriage, etc.
.....


I think the real lesson is not to ignore suspicious reading, sounds or
smells.
