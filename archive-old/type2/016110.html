&gt; Hey list,

&gt; is this charcoal canister mounted above the inside of the decklid with 
&gt; two
&gt; big clear tubes from the case to canister &amp; from canister to air cleaner
&gt; with two smaller tubes heading up to the air scoops?
&gt;
&gt; if yes, what years was this stock for? please consider I am in 
&gt; California
&gt; also with abundant smog and smog laws.

71 and onwards had them.  they're different for different years though.
(i only know that the 71 is probably a bit different than the 72-&gt;)

wrt smog laws, what year is your bus?  some of us are smog exempt (74 
and ealier, IIRC)
