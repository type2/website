I know of a pull start VW powered saw mill that used to kick back like a
SOB.  It had a magneto w/a locked advance.  A conventional ignition system
cured it.  Odd non-VW approved conversion.   Combined flywheel/Cooling fan
was mounted where the crank pulley should be but air flow was reversed. 
Blew from the bottom up.  No forced air cooling on the oil cooler.  Jeep
carburetor w/govener.  Tons of odd parts.
