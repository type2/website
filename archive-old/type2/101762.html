Subject: removing heads

Would removing the heads on my 72 type4 engine be a really difficult task 
with the engine in the car?? Should I just take the engine out or can it be 
done with the engine in? Also how can i tell if I have all the tin for my 
engine? Is there a list somewhere? Thanks

joey
