Dear Greg &amp; fellow listies,

Though this may seem a minor question, I was just wondering the very same
thing.  I think that information of this nature is exactly what this list is
all about and would like to encourage either the admin. or Greg please attach
at least one correct response to this as thread.  Too often I have searched
the archives and found questions on subjects I needed the answer to and there
was no answer to the question, thus defeating the purpose of archiving the
posting.

Thankx Volks!

May the &quot;Busma&quot; preserve us all !
