Folks,

I just encountered my first problem with the 78 bus that I bought a few
weeks ago.

As I was driving down a busy road (at rush hour!), I depressed the clutch,
stopped at a red light, and took the bus out of gear. When the light turned
green, I stepped on the clutch and tried to shift into first. I couldn't get
it to go into gear.

After fiddling with it for a few minutes, I finally got it into first. But,
there was a problem. When I put my foot on the clutch, the bus still wanted
to move forward. Shifting was absolute hell.

I fiddled with the wing nut that adjusts the clutch play, and things got
somewhat better. I could drive home.

Now, the bus runs, but I still have to give the stick a good shove to get it
into gear.

Should I continue to fiddle with the wing nut, or do I have a bigger
problem.
