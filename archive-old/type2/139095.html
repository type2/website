Subject: Re: [T2] once upon a pre-owned tuna can

totally daniel, and pretty soon we're going to be in agreement that the
essence is simplicity.  my understanding is that its not running right? is
there anything wrong here? i dunno, i'm just another vw-based wallet
probably out of skool, but when i hear mitsubishi i hear image makeover. old
and in the way.

 I understand where Jason's coming from, I understand the frustration of
 relying on a bus as a daily driver, especially when it's your only vehicle.
 It's just alot of pressure to fix your bus when you need to drive it the
 next day to work. For being your only car where you have to drive alot of
 miles it's not all that pratical to drive a bus unless it's in really good
 mechanical shape and being kept that way.
 
 Employers often aren't very forgiving when you are often late due to not
 starting or breaking down or not able to find rides to work because your
bus isn't running. In an ideal world you wouldn't ever have to be specific
 places at specific times but our society just isn't like that.
 
 But I'm worried that a Mitzoobitchy at 190K is going to have some serious
 problems soon and it will be alot harder to work on and require special
 tools that the bus.&gt;
 Ah, I'm really not worried. :)

 not directed at jason, but he can answer: this morning on the conscience of
 every type2 listee is the question why would anybody go from air cooled to
 a mitsubiache.
