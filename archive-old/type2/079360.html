Nigel:
I'd guess that they are for military (NATO) equipped type 2's. Interesting to
note that the part number of the lead begins with 181, which is the type number
of the Trekker or Thing, which was originally developed as a military vehicle.

&gt; Illustrated on Page &amp; Frame 94-10, of the Official 1968~79 VW Type 2,
&gt; Replacement Parts Catalogue &amp; Microfiche, is a special Ignition Coil, (Item
&gt; No. 2) with three water-proof gland connections, for the both the LT and HT
&gt; leads, plus ignition distributor, leads and other components with matching
&gt; connection fittings.
&gt;
&gt; I possess the ignition coil and one matching lead (length 275mm, 10.75
&gt; inches), having the following part numbers.
&gt;
&gt; Ignition coil (Item 2) - VW Part No. 122 905 115 D
&gt;                        - Bosch Part No. 0 221 107 001
&gt;
&gt; Matching lead (Item 25 ?) - VW Part No. 181 905 721
&gt;                           - Bosch Part No. 0 290 320 009
&gt;
&gt; Which VW Type 2s were they intended for?
