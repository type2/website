&gt; Hello all,
&gt;   First question for the list:
&gt;   After rummaging through the archive for a similar
&gt; problem, I can't seem to 
&gt; find others with this
&gt; same issue:  As I apply brakes, rpm's rise
&gt; dramatically.  As a guess, from 
&gt; 900 to 1500 - 2000.
&gt; And unlike one other thread in the archive, the
&gt; rpm's will stay up the 
&gt; entire time brakes are applied.  

It would seem to me that you are opening a vacuum leak
when you apply your brake. Apparently the engine is
running rich enough and the leak is small enough that
it doesn't kill the engine. As you have recently
replaced all the hoses and the problem continued, I
first suspected the diaphragm itself, but am leaning
toward the seal on the front side of the servo. There
is also a seal between the servo and master cylinder. 
I am not familiar with the early ones such as yours,
but it is probably time to disassemble the servo
mechanisms and clean it all up, replace seals as
needed and there is a filter on later models - don't
know on yours. -BaH
