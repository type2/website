Just wondering if anybody knows of any later model Type 2 die-cast metal or
plastic miniatures, from Matchbox-size, up to big display sizes. I'm looking
for '73 through '79 models specifically. I've been checking the online
auctions and having no luck, however, on a recent trip to San Francisco, I did
find an HO-scale version, just what I was looking for, almost matching my real
Type 2's colors! I also was wondering what VW's official name for the &quot;pumkin-
ish&quot; color on my two-tone '79 is. It's bottom color is brown; I believe VW
called this Agate brown. I've been told that VW called the colors by different
names by different countries...is this true? Your help on any of these
questions is greatly appreciated!!
