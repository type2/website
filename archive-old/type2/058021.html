Subject: rusty front beam swing arm

When in grad. school I had the dreaded &quot;20 deg. of free play&quot; in the
steering.  Swing lever housing was completely separated except at the top
front edge!  Wrapped wire and rope around it, limped it home, and laid
under there with a welding torch to weld 1/8&quot; steel bar completely around
the torsion tube &amp; the bushing housing in a diagonal double pattern.
Worked until I could find a junkyard beam for $60!   I've seen fixes with
giant hose clamps just to get one home....This is a prime spot I check
(scrape off all grease and look for signs of rusting out).
