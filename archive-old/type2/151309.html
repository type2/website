Subject: Re: [T2] Qu re hot start fix in FI busses

Hi Mike,

If there's power to the solenoid, then the double-relay sends it to  
the fuel pump. When the starter is released the power to the fuel  
pump comes from the switch inside the AFM.

The remote starter is still powering the solenoid, so the system will  
work the same no matter which switch you trigger the starter with.

The qu relates to the fuel pump- If one puts the ign on, but don't go
to start, I assume using the bypass sw. does the same thing as the
&amp;quot;start&amp;quot; position on the ign sw - does this also turn on the fuel pump,
or is it the vacuum of the cylinders (deflecting the AFM) that turns on
the pump?  I notice a smaller wire is connected to the same upper spade-
is this for the fuel pump or does it flip the double relay to turn on
the pump?  (Karl said latter).  Also what is supposed to go on the  
lower spade of the
solenoid? There is nothing there.


Happy trails,
