Subject: SERIOUS FUEL DELIVERY PROBLEM

Got a carb problem. '74 1700 engine with 34PDSIT dual carbs. On the RH carb, the brass fitting that the fuel line clamps onto has backed out of the carb assembly pot metal, due, no doubt, to 32 years of use and vibration.

This brass tube appears to just press into the carb body assembly (at the top, just above the float bowl). Furthermore, pushing it back in by hand does not permanently solve my problem, it just loosens up again after so much driving.

This is a dangerous condition, as when this happens (only once, so far), fuel sprays all over the RH side of the engine.

Is this fitting indeed a &quot;pressed-in&quot; fitting. If so, what might be a fix, short of gettin a new carb?
