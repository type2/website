boo, im having trouble with that !_at_#$ woodruff key and the end of the
crankshaft. i took off the fan to change the seals and what did i find, some
stupid PO messed up the end of the crank, made the groove bigger and now my
fan moves about half an inch back and forth. i know itll snap off if i dont do
something. the po put locktite all over it. ive tried to use liquid nails.
didnt work. now ive put locktite all over it again. any other ideas. im
nervous about jb weld, sposin i want to get it off again sometime.

cheersw marty :)
