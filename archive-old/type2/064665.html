&gt;I am new at this, I would like to hear out from your experinces where I
&gt;should start off to restore my bus. My bus has a lot rusty area(mostly
&gt;bottom area). The both side of rocker &amp; inner strength rocker are busted
&gt;so are the cargo floor also the driver &amp; passanger floor. The both side of
&gt;front arc are kinda rusty too. Oppisite of battery tray are holed up !
&gt;RUST IS MY NUMBER ONE ENEMY!  Top of surface on the bus has rings rust.  I
&gt;have all the frigging equipment to work with. So where do I start? The
&gt;rocker? I rather to work on the easy area to tough area. Any feedback
&gt;would be appericated! 

What year bus?  That makes a difference in some of the approach, as to what
panels youget get repro.  I say start with the front floors, they are pretty
easy, then cargo floor, and finally rockers.
