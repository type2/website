Subject: Engine Way Too Hot

A month ago I bought a Oil Temp gauge. I asked the list what was a good op 
temp. I got every answer in the book. Well anyway I tooks someone's advice 
on testing the gauge and I placed the sensor in boiling water, and what do 
you know the temp needle was 3/4 between 200 and 220. Pretty accurate.

Now what worries me is on the highway I run 250 - 280. 280 on summer days on 
the highway going 60 - 65. I notice a definite power drop once the temp hits 
280.

The dipstick is warm, but not too hot to touch by any means. But maybe the 
plastic handle on the VDO dipstick doesn't carry heat as well as the 
original.

Some other advice I got was check the EGR, and sure enough the EGR filter 
was removed, actually they bent it back and forth until it broke off, but 
they never capped it so it was sucking in fresh air. So I disconnected the 
EGR valve linkage and capped the pipe.

All engine tin is in place and I have the spark plug wire rubber things on.

But she's still running hot. 280 today going 60 on the highway in 95 degree 
Georgia Heat.

What else should I try? or should I move to Canada?
