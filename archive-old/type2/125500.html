Subject: windshield wiper motor

I had a non deluxe 78 passenger  bus I parted out a while back.  A friend
recently had a 77 Deluxe and his wiper motor went bad.  I told him I had one
from the 78 but it wasn't from a deluxe so didn't have intermittents.  Well
we hooked it up and guess what.  intermittent wipers!!!

Were all bay motors capable of this and the deciding factor being the
switch?  How could you go about rewiring so you could get intermittent
wipers?

Thanks for any replies..
