&gt;I am not sure if I ever heard of anyone putting a 80+ Vanagon [T3] side shift trans in a bay bus [T2].

I've heard vague rumblings here and there that a few people have done it, but it's in the 
friend-of-a-friend realm so it's rather suspect in that regard.  Additionally, what I *have* 
gleaned about it is that it's a heckuva lot of work that involves adapting the entire Vanagon
shifter mechanism to the Bay Bus undercarriage.

( side note: I'm one of &quot;those people&quot; who's vaguely bothered by the use of &quot;T3&quot; when 
referring to Vanagons, because it causes confusion.  Type 3's (Fast/Square/Notchback) 
are also referred to as &quot;T3&quot; )
