&gt; Here's a question for everyone... what kind of mileage do you get with 
&gt; your VW van? Our '65, from the day it was new, never got better than 17 

'71 Hardtop Camper, stock 1600DP, 009, extractor, Weber progressive 
32/36, Compufire points replacement.  At 57mph I get 24-25mpg, this 
drops to about 20-21 if I drive 60mph.  Mixed city and highway yields 
about 18-19mpg.  This has been fairly consistant over the last 14,000 
miles.  Jim
