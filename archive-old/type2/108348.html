From: &quot;Ted Kitch&quot; &lt;ted_at_misha1_dot_net&gt;
&gt; Call and talk to Miles at extension 251 at Tirerack_dot_com.  He seems to
really know what he is talking about and is familiar with what does and
doesn't work on a bus.

Thank you, Kind Sir. :O)

Maybe Cy is a new guy, but I do have to appreciate that he did call me back
as promised, even if the news wasn't what I'd hoped for.
