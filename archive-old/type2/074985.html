Subject: Re: [T2] Welding your VW-braizing? Puzzling anecdote.



&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Brazing is a quick way to attatch panel's and do repair work, 
except for
&gt; the fact that primer, and paint doesn't stick to the brass, unless 
the area
&gt; is acid etched primed, with zinc chromate------
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Brazing is also a soft weld--not as strong as using steel wire----
&gt; 
&gt; As Terry says, brazing is not as strong as welding, but the tear 
apart force
&gt; required is still way more than you'll ever see on body panels.  
Brazing is
&gt; more like soldering, where the brass acts as a glue for the steel, 
than true
&gt; welding, where the steel is actually melted together.
&gt; 
&gt; Funny thing.  I brazed an inner fender for a truck several years 
ago, and
&gt; the brazed place has a magnetic field.  It attracts iron filings, 
and you
&gt; can just make out the shape of the line where the steel was torn and 
joined
&gt; with brass.  Maybe George Lyle or some other smart person knows why.

It's probably the steel that has the magnetic field.  Sometimes when 
you heat up steel to red-hot it will align with the earth's magnetic 
field.  Strange but true...

I use brazing when I repair holes in heat exchangers.  I cut a patch, 
lay it over the hole, and braze it all around.  Not pretty, but it 
works, and nothing beats OEM heat exchangers!
