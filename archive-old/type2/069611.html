I jusr ordered some heads from AVP and am very satisfied with their
customer service.  The person on the other end of the phone knew what she
was talking about, and when there was a problem getting my order out on
time she had it 2nd day air shipped to make sure I got it on time.

I haven't run the heads yet, due to a freaky electrical problem, but I'll
let you all know how they work.
