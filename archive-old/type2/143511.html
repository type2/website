&gt; On the subject of &quot;American Made&quot;, there is a lot to America that most US
&gt; folks don't recognize.  America extends from Tierra del Fuego to the
&gt; Arctic ocean.  Even &quot;US made&quot; can be twisted, as there are sweatshop
&gt; factories on US protectorate islands in the Pacific, where laborers are
&gt; imported from the far East and normal US minimum wage laws don't apply,
&gt; yet the goods can be labeled &quot;made in USA&quot;.

And then there's &quot;assembled in America&quot; (from an endless list of foreign
suppliers)...
