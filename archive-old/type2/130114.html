Subject: 73 Auto Tranny

My automatic 73 bus has bounced around mechanics for two years. 
I've read about 200 threads on this great site regarding this 
tranny, and am more confused than ever about what to do next. The 
gear shift cable broke off from the coupler/linkage going into the 
transmission.

My first mechanic told me I would NOT be able to put in another 
automatic tranny from a later year model. OK, so he attempted to 
machine a replacement part, but the linkage piece he machined kept 
bending once inside the housing. He then said the tranny was the 
problem, since the rod kept bending. He repeatedly told me another 
auto tranny from a later model would NEVER fit, so I shouldn't 
look into this option.

My new mechanic (1.5 years was way too long) is trying to match 
the gear shift cable linkage (I hope I&quot;m using the correct 
language for this part) with parts he has in the shop. No luck the 
past 6 months.

I realize I won't find a usable used part anywhere. After reading 
several threads, and after hearing advice from my mechanics, I'm 
completely confused about whether or not this seemingly small 
problem can be fixed, or even if I will be able to put in another 
late model tranny?????? I don't want to convert to a manual, but I 
want to get my bus running again! I miss it!

ANy advice on what my mechanic and I should consider?
