I'm posting this for a friend of mine.  I haven't seen this bus, but if Ken
says it's A-1 condition then it is.  I don't know how much $$$$ he wants for
it or anything about it so don't bother asking me - send messages to him at
kkorn_at_jump_dot_net if interested.  Located in Austin, TX  USA

Subject:	For Sale: 82 Westy 2.0 Aircooled

Our '82 Westy Vanagon L, 2.0 aircooled California is for sale. I love
driving 
it and we've restored virtually everything mechanical on it during the year
we 
have owned it, but my wife and I have decided that we need more room for
longer 
trips now that we've retired. Yesterday we bought a new '99 Rialta.

Everything works, the body is basically rustfree. It spent its whole life in

California and Texas. The engine was rebuilt with ALL new parts last fall
and 
we have about 5000 breakin miles on it. All new CV joints. Many other new
parts 
including new VW front seat cushions. I have all records going back to '92.
We 
have about $10000 invested. I'd like to recover as much of that as I can but

I'm realistic about price.

Please contact me if you are interested. &quot;Hana&quot; is ready to go anywhere!
