Subject: Re: Friday follies, have you seen the Compaq commercial

watching the tube of late and Compaq computer has a new commercial in
which a guy with a 23 window splitty is having trouble fixing a winshield
wiper and goes to the internet (RAMVA??) and finds out how to fix it.

fade to woman (wife) being asked &quot;What more could you want&quot; shows husband
and kids pushing splitty and she says &quot;new car! 

except for the put down nice looking bus, not sure what year looks about
61-62 or so but hard to tell from the quick pan. 

there's also a loaf in a new McDonalds commercial
