Subject: Re: [T2] seattle /west sound area parts

hi mike - the problem isn't very severe, the boot on the aux air reg is
split like a bagel and i've been taping it up since this morning. with
that i loose power under a little load when then engine starts running too
hot. i think a lot of you guys out there with hesitation problems should
check this boot first, especially if its an aftermarket one. mine lasted
about 1000 miles. i'll not be caught w/o extras again. so, it starts up
fine, and i might make it to seattle if i can get a hose clamp on it in
the morning.

on the other hand, do you mean to say if i plug the aux reg vac line and
plug its mate on the big &quot;s&quot; hose off the afm, i'll do just as well as if
i had the little 90 degree ruber boot?   - steve

&gt; I don't know the severity of your problem, but if you just need to start
&gt; the car, plug up the hole in the intake manifold and also plug the hole
&gt; in the &quot;S&quot; tube.  Then, if you're having trouble starting the engine,
&gt; hold the throttle open a little when you start the car to let it warm
&gt; up.  That should get you by...
&gt; 
&gt; Otherwise, check any FLAPS because they might happen to have a similar
&gt; elbow.

&gt; &gt; hi all, i'm on the road just a days ride away from home, but i need the
&gt; &gt; small, 90 degree aux air regulator boot to make it. is there by chance a
&gt; &gt; vw flaps open on
&gt; &gt; sunday in seattle or somewhere between port townsend and olympia? if not
&gt; &gt; how about saturdays?   - steve
