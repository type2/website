Subject: Re: [T2] oil, and the berg dipstick sender

&gt;Hello,
&gt;
&gt;I have a thought on this. Could you use that stock buzzer in the bus as the
&gt;one to sound when your getting too hot? I know where the wire is, could I
&gt;just splice it into the line going to the oil light itself?
&gt;
&gt;regards,
&gt;Christopher


a few folks mentioned this - yup, the seatbelt buzzer works fine, and that
is what i tried to wire in first, but a PO had removed the wires, and i
didn't feel like fishing in new ones.
