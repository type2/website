Earlier this week I came across an already started movie
Pattie Hearst. When &quot;Tanya&quot; and the SLO went to L.A.
they were crusing around in a bay window. And after the
Dallas - SFgame tonight - Married With Children (what a
waste of electrons)  had a splittie parked next to Al and his
wife in a flashcack sequence. It was white over terqoise. Looked
really clean.
