Subject: Re: [T2] camper cushion dimensions

Hi Matt,

Be careful when replacing that cushion to make sure that the foam you
use is of equal softness to the original. I'd suggest you either find
an original to replace it with, or replace *all* the foam together.

When I made my Westfakia, I widened the original 1973 Z-bed to full
width, simply by replacing all the cross-members with wider pieces of
plywood. I used the original seat foam to upholster the lower seat, and
a fresh piece of new foam for the seat back.

Unfortunately, the seat back foam was softer than the original foam
used in the rear cushion and seat bottom. This creates a low spot when
lying on it, corresponding right at my pelvis. Not a big deal until you
sleep that way for 3 or 4 nights in a row, when you suddenly wake up to
find your spine has been replaced with a soggy unsalted pretzel.

The very next weekend after my second trip to EveryBus found me
scouring a local boneyard to pull the foam from the seats of an ancient
and decrepit early-bay westy, and I sleep much straighter now.

Happy trails,

&gt; this is a question for all the non technical folks out there: I'm
&gt; trying to confirm the dimensions for the rear cushion - the one that
&gt; sits on top of the engine compartment - on a late '70s westy. I
&gt; measured it to be 35.5 x 43 x 3&quot;, but thought I'd get the dimensions
&gt; on an existing one to check.
