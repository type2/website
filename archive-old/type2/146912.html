Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Stranded, Ignition switch won't turn all the way

If you were stranded like this, could you wire up a new ignition switch 
and just have it dangle down rather than installing it below the wheel? 
Would this hippie fix get you home or somewhere where you could do a 
better job?

Just Wondering,
