&gt; It's been forever since I have had any motivation to
&gt; work on my poor bus. I've been collecting parts I knew
&gt; I would need, but just have not been able to actually
&gt; do any of the work.



I feel your pain Dave. The wife, son and I just moved into a new house and I
have been so caught up with &quot;new home owner&quot; projects that Zoey has been
neglected. (Somewhere DurocShark is shaking his head).

I just got out there today to put a few more clamps on a continuing vacuum
leak battle I am having. It felt good to be in the garage - and not to mow
the lawn for a change.

Now I just need to order that steering pin kit and get to work on that.
Right now, my bus is as steady as a newborn deer on a frozen pond. When the
wind blows, I pray that the other lane is not occupied...
