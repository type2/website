&gt;   I would prefer not to get into jetting yet until I have an

&gt;the basics.

Unfortunately, you do not have much of a choice.  The only meaningful 
control of air-fuel mixture is via jetting/venturis.
If you're talking about the four screws (one at the base of each carb), 
those are only idle volume screws.  You need to learn &quot;the basics&quot; about 
all of the following if you want to set the air fuel mixture correctly:

idle jets
air correction jets
main jets
emulsion tubes
venturis

The Dellorto superformance book will explain all of this to you.  CB 
Performance might be able to hook you up with a copy since they wrote 
it.  They also have a small selection of replacement jets for those carbs.
