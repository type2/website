&gt; Whoa there.  The 215mm flywheel will fit in the 002 bellhousing just fine

&gt; use the 228mm flywheel.

    Or you can do like I have now -- the 228mm flywheel and 002
bellhousing with just a bit of magnesium ground off the high spots
inside the bellhousing. Doesn't really take very long either, with just
a &quot;rotary file&quot; chucked into a 1/4&quot; drill -- nothing fancy. But only the
automatic starter works with this -- neither the '73 nor the '81 starter
works at all.
