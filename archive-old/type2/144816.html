&gt; How necessary is a new oil cooler when doing an engine rebuild?

If the engine is being rebuilt due to wear and the old cooler isn't
leaking then there is no reason that it cannot be reused.

However, if the engine suffered a nastier failure that might introduce
nasty stuff into the oil system then it should be replaced.

I note that many engine builders always supply a new cooler with a new
engine, probably to prevent folks from using grunge-filled old filters.

I recall years ago when my father went through three new transmissions (on
warranty, no less) on a Dodge before convincing the dealer that it might
be a good idea to replace the transmission cooler with the new
transmission.
