Hi Bob,

Perhaps it had something to do with the storage of the engine before  
I got it. What if it was laying on its side for a decade and all the  
oil ran to the 3-4 side??

I've seen a loose head before, it had finger-tight nuts and the  
blowby tracks were really easy to spot. This one is clean as a  
whistle, and the nuts were plenty tight.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; understand one, but both on one side would lead me to think it is
&gt; something else, probably in the head rather than the cyl??
