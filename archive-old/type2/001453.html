Subject: timing trouble
Message-ID: &lt;000b01be8925$00795720$5859fed0_at_default&gt;

Hi volks! Gotta question.....

I have a newly aquired 80 westy with a new (2000 miles) 2.0L CV engine
converted for a Weber Progressive (i think) carb. There is no emmisions
valve stuff (EGR etc.) anywhere (that I know of). i have had the absolute
worst time trying to get this thing timed right.  I just got a timing scale
&gt;from Bus Depot and got it mounted, found and marked the timing marks on the
pully, but I cant get it... I have a 009 distributor (no vaccume advance)
which I converted to electronic (I hate points) and currently have the
timing around 8 btdc. The idle is bouncing from about 850 to 1000 and the
engine  hesitates for a second when I'm accelerating from a dead stop.
Every once in a while when I turn off the engine i get a little baby
backfire [more like a backburp :) ]. Any ideas? Maybe it's somting else? I
think I have the mixture on the carb right and everything runs perfect after
about 5 mph but its just annoying ya know? Thanks.
