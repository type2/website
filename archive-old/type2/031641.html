&gt; Here's a nice note I got from Bob Donalds (whose back in Bean-Town) and

&gt; &gt;Nice to hear from you. I can't build type 4 engines fast enough--what's with
&gt; &gt;that? My current price is 2K and I have found a cam that works with the stock

&gt; becoming &gt;air bound and that preloading hydraulic valves should be
&gt; considered optional. &gt;This editors note will also be in the newest printing
&gt; of the big green book.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;bound lifters that DO expand when the engine heats up. Air bound lifters DO
&gt; &gt;hold the valves when the engine warms up. The 006.ths clearance cold is 
&gt; &gt;needed when air is present in the lifters 0 lash will not do. The most

&gt; bled &gt;lifters will self-adjust in as little as 10 minutes. It has been my
&gt; experience  &gt;that air bound lifters will NEVER self-adjust when preloaded
&gt; or bleed because &gt;of the air that is trapped above the check valve. The

what do you do about this and how can you &quot;Really&quot; know wheather or not a
lifter is air bound????
