&gt;Would it also help to put louvers in the  &quot;engine door&quot; , bring 
&gt;fresh air down through the radiators , into the intake, and then 
&gt;wouldn't the hot air go straight out the back then?  I'd love to put 
&gt;a subaro engine in my '77 ,but don't like to have a radiator up 
&gt;front.

	That has been done by some bus owners who were sticking with 
the aircooled engine.  IMHO they're mistaken.  The louvres some of 
the ram-air effect from the intake scoops at speed.  This precious 
pressure surplus above the engine is helpful to cooling.
	If the motor is replaced by, say, a 2.2-L hopped-up Soobaroo, 
that surplus air pressure above the engine is no longer of comparable 
importance for cooling, but you still want as much pressure in that 
engine compartment as you can get, to improve breathing.  Sure, 
turbocharging it isn't; but every little bit helps.  All these motors 
are just air-pumps in which a drop of fuel is exploded from time to 
time; better airflow is the secret for efficient operation.
	In summary: preserve what air-pressure surplus you can get in 
that engine compartment.  It is valuable for pushing the combustion 
air thru the motor, even if you've gorn decadent and slapped in a 
water-cooled motor.
	And do not pre-heat that air on its way down from the scoops 
please.  Put your plurry radiators elsewhere!
	BTW has anyone told  us where VW put the radiator when they 
so stupidly abandoned the airhowler late in the 1970s to manufacture 
the water-cooled Vaganon or whatever it's called?
