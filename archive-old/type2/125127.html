Subject: Re: Necking Knobs and Scrapping 1973 Auto 1700 Westphalia

Hi,

I've just got round to replying -- I know, I'm sorry -- to those who'd
expressed an interest in parts of my old bus.  If you've not received a
personal reply, it's because I'm an ineffable eejit and I've lost your mail.
If you've got the patience, mail me again.

On the subject of &quot;Necking Knobs&quot; I'd certainly never heard them called that
but I did have one for my Auto camper -- with no gears to change, nowhere to
get in a hurry and only one hand on the wheel, it certainly was a relaxing
way to get nowhere in particular.  *sigh*  Anyway, if anyone wants one,
that's up for grabs too.  Thought I do believe they're illegal, or at least
would fail you an MoT test in this green and rainy land.

Cheers,

Chris.
