&gt; When I replaced the hinges on my new/old engine hatch, I used stainless
&gt; steel allen head bolts with little stainless steel washers.  It looks
&gt; unstock, but you have to look pretty close, and if you do, well, it looks
&gt; pretty clean.
&gt; 
&gt; As for security, you can pull a hatch off in about 3 minutes, pins or no.

If engine room security is an issue you may want to seek out a locking
engine lid latch. They are available from several vendors. A quick check of
the Bus Depot website turned up

Engine hatch lid handle, locking w/keys, 72-79 bus    $69.95
 211 827 503L

BD does not spec a color but I recall hearing that these were only available
in black.
