Something has gone a miss with my newly installed Weber, I am asuming a
screw has worked loose. Its running at about 1500 Rpm on idle and running
on when the ignition is switched off. Now heres the stupid question for
the day, which is the idle and fuel adjustment screws as I have left the
destructions at home and have not yet familiarised myself with the beast.
Dont want to sit for an hour in peak hour traffic with the engine idling
at 1500Rpm, as you can understand. Keep Bussin On.
