Hi Volks,

al brase &lt;braseelec_at_forbin_dot_com&gt; wrote to the List:
&gt; the following DoKa: T3 Bj88 3,21 6-Zylinder Oettinger Attk,
&gt; Ausstattung: Serie 140,000km., Motor 50,000km., Getriebe neu v.
&gt; Oettinger, Preis: VHS Peter Schumacher, Losheim . I can only assume
&gt; that VHS stands for Very High Something. 

:-)  No, that's short for &quot;Verhandlungssache&quot; (meaning something like 
&quot;let's talk about it after you've seen it&quot;, a rip-off more often than 
not), which is also frequently called &quot;VS&quot;.  &quot;VB&quot; stands for 
&quot;Verhandlungsbasis&quot;, roughly your &quot;obo&quot;/&quot;or best offer&quot;.

&gt; Oh well, to rich for my
&gt; pocketbook, but a 6-cylinder Oettinger, that's the engine  they all
&gt; should have come with. I've never even been sure they made one!

They're few and far between.  But I wouldn't want one -- way too much 
fuel consumption...

Yours,
    Erik.
