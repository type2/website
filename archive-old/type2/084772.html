&gt;What machinist lets a part out with the shavings still on it?


As far as I know that is just common practice, and some machine 
shops even state on their invoice that it is your responsibillity 
to make sure all the shavings are cleaned out before assembly. The 
German machine shop I used to deal with (Ahnendorp) even makes you 
do the deburring etc. yourself.
