Subject: Re: [T2] more FI questions (fixed-repost)

Rob,

Looks great in linux/pine.  The fuel pump tester I got from sears ended up
with the end cut off....it was just easier.

fuel pump to  fuel ring entrance next to #3.  ring goes around by the cold
start valve over toward the 1/2 side and then hits the pressure regulator
going thru the firewall and then on to the return line in the tank.

No pressure, no go.  Minimum on my engine that was runnable(at idle) was
about 20-25psi.

With a bad(stopped up) pressure regulator, you can get 125psi *very*
quickly.  Pressure regulator is there to keep from getting too much
pressure.

My pressure after fixing everything stayed at around 30psi over night.

No pressure at the fuel ring means bad pump, bad filter, maybe completely
open return line to the tank.....although such a thing seem improbable.

Do the fuel pump delivery test as shown in the manual...very carefully!

Maybe stick a piece of hose on the pump and run it into a clean opaque
milk jug so you can see how fast it flows.

Cheers, dave

&gt; 
&gt; I finally got ahold of a fuel pressure tester today, but of course since
&gt; nothing is ever simple in my life, the gauge has a threaded fitting at the
&gt; end thus it wouldn't hook up to to the terminal on the ring main.  Not
&gt; deterred and after seriously considering cutting off the end of the gauge
&gt; hose, I found an air-hose fitting in my toolbox that would thread on to the
&gt; gauge fitting and the other end is made for a hose, that and a piece of fuel
&gt; line later I had adapted the gauge to fit the ring main terminal.  So I run
&gt; the starter and the gauge reads zero.  When I remove the gauge and run the
&gt; starter, the fuel squirts out (easily plugged with a finger though), but I
&gt; read nothing on the gauge when it's hooked up.  I have fire, and the engine
&gt; actually fired a couple of times, but apparently my fuel pressure is zilch. 
&gt; 
&gt; Shouldn't the fuel pressure gauge (brand new) read at least something since
&gt; fuel is being pumped?  This fuel pump is an FI pump but had been pumping to
&gt; a carb for the last couple of years, could this have over-worked it and
&gt; caused it to drop it's pressure output?
&gt; 
&gt; My Bentley says the hose from the fuel pump connects to the pressure
&gt; regulator, but mine goes to the ring main on the left side of the engine
&gt; before eventually reaching the regulator on the other side.  Do I have
&gt; something backwards?   Looks right to me.
&gt; 
&gt; Last question (for now): Fuel flows from the tank out of the return hose
&gt; when unplugged from the regulator,  that's supposed to happen right?
&gt;  
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
