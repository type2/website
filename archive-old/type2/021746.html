Hi Volks!

Congratulations!

[1600 upright in post-71]
&gt; I've heard a rumor that there is a part (made by VW) that fits 
&gt; into the engine compartment to seal it off. Apparently (if the 
&gt; rumor is true) late model bays in Europe had the option of a 2.0 
&gt; litre or a 1600. 

That rumour is true.  I have such a '72.  And a '74, a '77, and
a '78, now that I come to think of it.  ;-)

&gt; If you opted for the 1600, it had a drop in peice to make up 
&gt; for the extra space in the engine compartment. 

Not really.  There was just different sheetmetal attached to the
engine than that of pre-72 Buses and Bugs, to close the larger
engine bay and seal with the normal post-71 engine seal.

&gt; Does anyone: (1) have one 

Tricky.  Might be available through dealers here in Germany.
Used, no.  I'd have to look around for a set.

&gt; (2) know the name of it 

Engine sheetmetal for Type 1 engine in 72-79 Type 2.

&gt; (3) know where it might be available 

See above.

&gt; (4) have any contacts in Europe that may have info on it

I am such a contact.  If you can't find any contacts closer to
you, p-mail and we'll work out the details.

Airhowlingly yours, 
   Erik.
