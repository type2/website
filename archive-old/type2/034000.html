Subject: Big O Tires- look around!  (Kumho 852)

&gt; Am trying Costco's Kirtlands in LT 195-14 right now.  They too
&gt;are 'cheap' tires.  About $48 each.  Other WetWestie members swear by
&gt;them.

Look around- you can buy Yoko y356 or Kumho 852 tires for this EXACT SAME
PRICE!  Look for a mom and pop-type of tire distributor that sells
'wholesale to the public'...  there's a place in Knoxvegas that sells wierd
stuff like the Kumho, the Nokian, and the Hankook right next to Goodyear
tractor tires and bobcat tires.

I felt like the odd man out when I went to get them- pulled up in a VW next
to a bunch of beat-up Fords, went inside and was greeted by a bunch of
&quot;workin' men&quot; chewing tobacco...  I got the hairy eyeball at first, that's
for sure.  They looked at my tires (Kumho 852) and one guy said that he
liked the look of them so well that he was going to get some to put on his
F350 Diesel.  The owner said that they had been selling them for a couple of
years to delivery truck owners and had never had one case of a return or
defect.  Good enough for me.

I have reports of 30-50k on the Yokos and 40-60k on the Kumhos.  And these
are the correct size!
