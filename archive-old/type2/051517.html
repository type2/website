Subject: Re: [T2] Carb Rebuild '73 Euro Panel

&lt;&lt;Any vehicle that sits unused for that period will require: &gt;&gt;

Very good advise on checking out a bus that has been sitting a while.

Please note that I did say this bus has been sitting with little use the past 
10 years.  That means that it has been started or driven occasionally during 
that period and the gas tank and all systems on this bus other than the carb 
appears to be in good condition.

I drove the bus over 1000 miles to bring it home.  The steering was tight and 
the brakes performed well.  The fuel gauge is flaky and the odometer doesn't 
work.  I'll be looking for a replacement speedo once I get the engine checked 
out and running well.

I have a spare cluster from a '78 that I may try to use.  If this doesn't fix 
the fuel gauge, I'll end up dropping the tank anyway to replace the sender.

Thanks for everyone's suggestions on the carb rebuild.  I may not get a 
chance to install it until this weekend, so I'll post the results when I try 
it out.
