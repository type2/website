Subject: VW Bus FAQ

Not content to rest on my laurels after putting up the wiring diagrams (Take
a bow, Mr Bryant) I wanted to go one step further: I want to create a VW Bus
FAQ.

I get asked all kindsa questions all the time.  I got tired of typing the
same answers.  I want to be able to tell people &quot;read the FAQ at
http://www_dot_calweb_dot_com/~thom/busfaq.html&quot; and live a calmer, more peaceful
life, with more time to crash into trees on my mountain bike.

Anyway, after all that marketing BS...  I am looking for input into this FAQ.  

Topics to be included are:

What year is my bus?
What kind of bus do I have?
Where can I buy a bus?
What do I look for when buying a bus?
Where do I get parts for my bus?
Whats a barndoor?  Isn't that the one with 2 side doors? (you'd be surprised!)
What size engine can I put in my bus?
...you get the point.

This will be a continually growing document, as nobody can possibly know
everything about busses.  Not even Charlie Hamill.

I have started on the page, not much there yet:
