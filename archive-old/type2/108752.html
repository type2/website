Subject: propane tank valve, replace myself?

I am a confirmed lurker and I'm hoping some of you with more experience (I
guess that would be most of you) can set me straight.  I have a 74 kombi that
is in need of a new valve on the propane tank for the stove.  I ordered the
part from a local RV enterprise.  They want to charge me $55 for an hours
labor for what looks like a 6 minutes job. I realize that is how these things
are done but man, it really bugs my DIY bent not to mention my skin flint
nature.  The only advice from friends and family has been to not mess around
with propane because it is &quot;dangerous&quot;.  I can deal with that if this list
confirms it. So what do you think can I do it myself?  I am a capable gal and
have had no trouble following Muir and Bentley to learn how to do the valves,
plugs, change oil and other tidbits.
Thanks in advance,
Donna
