Subject: [T2] MOST EXCELLENT STEREO

How about a straight answer here. I purchased, from
Ultimate Electronics, a Panasonic DPG 615 cd player w/
cd changer or aux input, it has a credit card sized
remote (works from the bed of my westy) plenty of
power,anti-skip memory, cool retro looks, etc... 
$279.00. I purchased a pair of boston acoustics 6 1/2&quot;
2-way speaker, i think they were cx67's, ordered the
1/2&quot; spacers, from boston, to fit them in my front
doors. Most Excellent sound Quality, $129.00 a pair.
Future upgrades rear all wheather speakers removable.
I listen to all sorts of music, Phish, primus, carlos
santana (for the elders) the dead, neal young, etc...
plenty of volumr _at_ highway speed. only running 1-pair
of speakers, so I asuume that if I get a pair of
removable all wheather speakers that an amplifier
would be needed to keep a clean sound _at_ higher
volumes.
anyway thats what ive got and it suits me just fine.
and the homies, (proper spelling) think it sounds just
fine even on the inside. Oh by the way the radio
listed is standard equipment on civilian humvee's,
must be why its nver skipped. Thanks for reading.
