&gt;  Where can I get a stock ignition switch with stock keys?
&gt;
You can get the lock cylinder for your ignition switch re-keyed to match 
your old keys, but of course, you've got to take it out again and take 
it to a locksmith :-)


&gt;  The van now seems to idle a little faster than it did
&gt;before.  Since I only messed with the points who does this
&gt;relate to the idle.  I set the gap to .016&quot; like my book
&gt;said.  Is this right or should I reset them to something
&gt;else.  Or do I just not do a good enough job setting them
&gt;and now need to recheck my work?
&gt;
Changing the points gap changes the ignition timing.  You now have to 
re-set your ignition timing to spec.  Sounds like it has been advanced 
somewhat by your changing the points, so the engine idles faster.  Also, 
while you are in there, I would set the points to .018&quot; (BEFORE you set 
the timing).  But then again, it is only .002&quot; so decide how bad you 
want to change it :-) -- .016&quot; is at the low end of the spec and it's 
fine, but .018&quot; is right in the middle of the spec. range.
