Subject: BN4 

Long time listener...

	I sent this question a few days ago, but lack of any response means I 
probably sent it to the wrong place...
	You may want to delete right now if you have no interest in the BN4 heater. 
If you do I'm sorry for the long explanation, but I know that adepts work 
best with all the facts.

	OK. For the last few months I've been educating myself on the BN4 that came 
with my 70 westy - THANKS to Ron Van Ness for the incredibly rare and 
vaulable sharing of his e-knowledge, and Espar Canada for the FREE manuals - 
my struggle seems to *amuse* them somehow.
	OK. Getting to know - i mean really know this piece of elegant equipment 
has brought great joy, and then one night the bench test brought joy and 
HEAT . Belching, blasting, smoking heat. WOW.
	OK. Put it in the van, double-checked all hookups, turned it on and got 
fan. So far so good. I waited and still only got fan. I checked other 
individual components - spark, glow and regulator - and they are all 
working. Auto shut off kicked in after a minute or so. and the breaker 
switch seems to be working.
	OK. I know I jumped wires to and fro' during my bench test, so just to 
prove I'm not crazy, I (against better judgement) clip a jumper from the hot 
switch wire (coming from the dash) to the relay post and click...SWOOSH 
-instant heat. I take the wire off and the heat continues. What have I done. 
Should I be dead?
	Let me say that I don't recommend this form of science, because it seems to 
override the built in safety systems, like the regulator cut-off, which 
should have stoped gas from dribbling into the combustion chamber - ask me 
how I know.
	OK. QUESTIONS...
1.	Why might the pump not kick in when everything else works. Is it related 
to a safety system that holds back gas until the chamber is preheated - ie 
my glow plug is weak?.
	If this is the case, it seems strange that the regulator valve opens, 
without gas coming. This means that it's not going to let pressure build up 
in the diaphram, which is actually what regulates the fuel output.
2.	Is this a simple problem of crossed wires, or miswiring? I cannot find a 
wiring diagram for the early BN4 any where. Does anyone have access to one. 
(I *think* this is the problem, but not sure...)
3.	On-demand safe heat is so *close*. What are the possibilities? Is there a 
special starting proceedure with the dash switch?
4.	Have I blown an internal fuse I don't know about, or is there a 
thermostatic switch gone bad?
