Going out to the rust yard thats about an hour away from me in Tuscaloosa a
funny thing happened. I had a complete tread seperation on my right front
tire. Now I took my foot off the gas peddle and let the ole bast_at_#$% coast
to the shoulder. I turned to my 2 VW fanatic friends that were riding with
me and said. &quot;You know what would have happened if I were a Soccer Mom in an
SUV?&quot;, &quot;I would have freaked out and turned the wheel as hard as I could to
one direction just to see how much I could make this thing roll!&quot;

Now the problem is that my old front tires were 75's I had the shop put on 2
60's in the front. What are the potential problems of running 75's on the
rear and 60's on the front?
