Subject: 1977 Transporter for sale

Hello All,
I am going to take one shot at this, and not a lot of time, since I don't
have much.
I have a 1977 Transporter for sale.  The 2.0 runs awesome.  The headliner
seems great.  Does not have any rear seats. The doglegs are weak, the
rockers are weak and there is a whole under the rear lid.  It needs a
clutch, tires and brakes.  I will do the needed work and sell it for $1,900
$1500 as it is.
I am located in Columbus Ohio
