&gt; this may sound silly, but i can't get the cylinder heads off the 1.8L

&gt; holding the head on is the pushrod tubes. The tubes seem to move some

&gt; try pulling the head off and damage something. how do I remove the
&gt; pushrod tubes?

the push rod tubes come out without taking the head off, under (above) the
tubes is a small deflector plate it is bolted to the block (at least on
mine) and it wraps over the fins of the cyl, and sometimes catches on the
head.  so check to see that that is removed.  (this is all from memory but
It sounds right. check Bently too)
