Subject: '71 Westy Fuel Tank System

Greetings! I've recently reentered the VW game once again with a '71 Westy! 

I am having the infamous &gt;1/2 full gass fumes problem and I am trying to 
narrow it down but there are a couple details about the '71 that I would 
love to have confirmed. 

This model bus at least my bus does not have the fuel vents that go up 
inside the air intakes on each side instead I have a hose going out of the 
fan housing into the charcoal can and then another hose going what looks to 
be the fuel tank or somewhere through the firewall. 

Questions: 

1. With this particular year does the fuel tank vent through the gas cap 
since it looks like air is being pushed through the can and into the tank? 

The tank was recently resealed and installed so I'm currently assuming the 
filler neck hoses, etc are O.K. 

Any info to confirm the venting setup on this model of bus would be very 
helpful as I have not yet been able to locate any diagrams or anything of 
the sort to confirm this. 

Thanks!
