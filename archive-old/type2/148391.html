Subject: This list

Hey folks,

I just had an &quot;experience&quot; with another automotive interest list. I 
won't say what kind of car, but it wasn't German and it wasn't air 
cooled.

It was such a contrast to this list that I feel the need to pat 
everyone on this list on the back for being reasonably rational, 
supportive, encouraging; for having a healthy respect for logic; and 
most of all for having a sense of humor about our buses and for 
generally being pretty good eggs.

Mark
