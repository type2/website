Subject: A Great VW Story (long, but good)

        Since I was ten years old I have wanted to take a trip around the country.  When I was a kid I watched television shows and movies like; Route 66, Then Came Bronson, Two Lane Blacktop,  Easy Rider,  The Wacky Racers (cartoon) etc... .  For some reason I found them to be the most exciting maimly becuase of the adventuresome nature of the characters.  That and the fact they were cool.

        I had always said that I would take this trip by my 40th birthday.  Well, I turn 40 this January, and I was a bit dissappointed in myself for not yet fulfilling my dream.  I really don't have that much money, and it would basically mean dropping everything, and hitting the road on a wing and a prayer.  Maybe finding some temp work on the way to make ends meet.  

      For the past several month's I had been praying about it some, even though I am not &quot;rabidly religious&quot; I still believe in God, and I believe he has always been with me, even when I wasn't with him.  I prayed that if he wanted me to do this, He would make a way.

Well, he did, and in a most miraculous fashion, as you would expect God to do.  : )

        A few weeks ago I started non-chalantly looking for a vehicle on-or-in which to take this journey.  I answered adds for motorcycles, knowing I couldn't afford a big enough bike, but all the same hoping.  I looked at vans, american made, all of which were ragged out and rusty.  then I stumbled on a 1970 bus body, reasonalbvle interior but no engine.  ironically I stumbled on it about the ame time my car (mustang 4 cylinder) decided to give me a scare.  But, it was only a vaccum hose, (place relief sigh here) so no big deal after all.

        After I found the bus body, I started searching to fix it back in shape.  I had called some folks that had put adds in the local shopper pertaining to VWs, and eventually made contact with a guy named Zack.

        Zack had listed a 1979 Bus, with custom camping interior for $1000.00, I called him and found out in the conversation that he had just finished his trek around the country.  It seems that Zack (22 years old) had gotten wrapped in wild side of life.  He was a user, and was a bit strung out emotionally.  He decided that the only way he could pull himself through to be someone that might have a chance at life, was to do something, and that something was a trip around the country.  

        So he bought a trashed out bus, fixed it in shape, and built his camping stuff inside.  Did a great job I might add.   

        laft on October 12, 1995 and 6 months later returned a new person.  He explained it like this; &quot;Of all the interesting people I met on the trip, the most interesting one I met was myself.&quot;  While on the road he became not only acqainted with himself, but also Christ.

        I told him that at the least, even if I couldn't get the Bus, I would like to sit down and talk to him about the trip.  He agreed and we met at a Waffle House between where he and I live one evening last week.  he showed me his memoirs and collection of stuff he gathered, and we just sat and talked about the trip, matters of spirtuality, and the journey that one takes in finding real peace in life, a peace that is balanced with learning and motivation, and in the end produces a product worthy of the effort put into it, and one that moves others to quality actions.

        Well, after all the conversation, I asked him, Zack! I said, what is the least you would take for the bus?  he sat and stared me straight in the eye and said, &quot;Charlie, I have totally enjoyed meeting you and listening to your philosophy of life, and if you want the bus, I will give it to you&quot;.  

        I sat there and tried to decipher what I had just heard, my rebuttal was &quot;man, there ain';t no way you are giving me that bus, seriously, what is the least you can take?&quot;  He once agian looked at me and said, &quot;it's yours, come to my house and pick it up.  

        He explained to me that this is something he needed to do.  The Bus gave hima certain amount of power, mainly the power to see value in giving more than recieving.  He said that he wanted me to have it so I could take my journey of a lifetime.  Besides he had three other cars, one new, a motorcycle, and a good job.  He is going to seminary to study for the mission field and so goes his life.  

The only stipulations he made was that;  1-  I take the trip, and 2-when I start to get rid of it, I have to give it away to someone else that needs it.

I will meet both!

        Folks, the bus is in great condition, except for some suface rust, and the engine just needed a tune up.  I have driven it over 200 miles, and so far no pings bangs or bongs.  I am leaving on January 9, and would love to meet as many Volks as I can.  The purpose of my trip will be to study and involve myself in as much volunteer and service activities as possible.  An example would be, Habitat for Humanity, AmeriCorps, and small grassroots org's.  

        This is the miracle that I needed people to hear about.  This has been probably the greatest amount of inspiration I have recieved in all 39 1/2 years on this earth.  It has given me more faith in what our youth are doing and thinking.  Besides that, I want to be just like Zack when I grow up!

Thanks,
Charlie Ford
