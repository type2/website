Subject: RV plates and alcohol, a cops perspective
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

i was recently instant messaging my friend back in NY
who happens to be a cop, so i posed the question to
him about drinking in a vehicle with RV plates.  the
conversation is below.  basically it seems that it
would be technically legal, but i probably wouldnt
want to find out.  what better officer to ask than one
whos screen name is morgans and coke:)

vwcampin: hey ive got a question for you.  on my bus
email list we have been arguing about the legalities
of dinking in a vehicle.   the question is if your
vehicle is classified as an RV with RV plates, would
it be legal for occupants other than the driver and
not sitting in front to consume alcohol while the
vehicle is in motion.  basically if you were in back
of an rv, can you drink?

morgans_n_coke: hmmm


morgans_n_coke: doing my research.....ive got it

vwcampin: ok cool

morgans_n_coke: vehicle and traffic law section 1227
of the state of new york states that no person shall
consume an alcoholic beverage in a passenger motor
vehicle being driven upon the public highways.  for
the purposes of this section of vehicle and traffic
law, a passenger vehicle shall mean a vehicle designed
to carry ten or more passengers and used to carry
passengers for  hire or profit

vwcampin: cool thanks, i dont know if it would list
this or not but would it be different for a
recreational vehicle or would an RV be considered a
passenger vehicle

vwcampin: sorry to ba pain in the ass 

morgans_n_coke: a rv is considered a passenger motor
vehicle.  however, it wouldnt be covered because it
isnt designed to carry ten or more people...its
designed to carry usually 5-8 and those people's
possessions

vwcampin: so could they drink do you think?

morgans_n_coke: i wouldnt write anyone a ticket for
it, but as we all know there are a$$hole cops out
there
