Subject: Re: [T2] Now..hot was method...was [T2] Exaust Leak



&gt; No flames, Dave!  New techniques are highly valued and I thank you 
for the
&gt; idea.  I will try this next time I run into a problem that looks 
amenable!
&gt; BTW, tho, I will *really* have a fire extiguisher close at hand for 
this
&gt; as wax burns bright and hot!
&gt; 
&gt; On the nuts, I do know that stainless will rust eventually but it 
takes a
&gt; lot longer than plain steel.  As I said in the list of options there 
are
&gt; no perfect materials so we do the best we can :-)

There are various varietes of stainless (properly called CRES 
for &quot;Corrosion REsistant Steel&quot; by the pedantic) and tney do vary in 
their corrosion resistance.  Pure chromium is quite corrosion 
resistant, so steel with high levels of chromium won't rust at all.  
Unfortunately the chromium also reduces the strength and ductility of 
the steel, so the part that doesn't corrode might fracture instead.

You also get interesting electrochemical effects that might not affect 
the steel but which might cause corrosion of adjacent metals.  This is 
more a concern with dissimilar metals that live in an electrolyte like 
water.

Even with stainless nuts, it's a good idea to get a supply at hand so 
you can change them every time the part is off.  If you use stainless 
nuts and anti-sieze you should not have any problems getting the nuts 
off when you want them off.

If you can, get the flanged nuts that have a 12mm hex instead of a 
13mm hex plain nut.  This gives you more room to maneuver.  Flanged 
nuts are popular on Japanese vehicles, and are often used on exhaust 
flanges.  I don't know if they are stainless, but they don't seem to 
corrode badly in exhaust applications.
