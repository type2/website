&gt; It's called MYWIFE. If we go camping,
&gt; and it's at all cold, she's all over me like a cheap suit, scavanging
heat.
&gt; [Not that I mind, no fool I ]  She has an automatic heat sensor, which
causes
&gt; her to roll away if it gets too hot, come in closer when it gets cold. And
an
&gt; air freshener component...what is it about womens shampoo??? Drives us
guys
&gt; nuts...
