Dear Listees:

I recently had occassion to have an encounter with a light pole and my 87
vanagon weekender.  I was taking a shortcut between two parking lots that
should have, but didn't connect.  (If you have been to SLC lately, you know
what I mean.--You can't get anywhere from here!)  In the process this light
pole just jumped out and bit me.  I still haven't gotten use to the back
wheels  not following the front wheels like they do on my 77 transporter.

Anyway,  I purchased a new hydralic ram body tool from Harbor Freight (if
any one locally has a need, contact me) and proceeded to correct the
indiscretion. Now I am trying to reassemble the rear seats to the frame.
This is my problem.  The original 11mm x 35 mm bolts that fasten the seat
to the frame are now to short.  Evidently, the new body tool worked a
little too well and I'm now 20mm wider.  No problem, just order a bolt 11mm
x 55 mm, right.  That's the problem.  No place I can find carries 11 mm
bolts with fine threads.  Why does VW use bolts with a bastard dimension?
Anyone have any suggestions?

Have fun
