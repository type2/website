&gt; Mofoco is in Milwaukee, about 5 hours from me, and sell rebuilt  Type

&gt; in a poke&quot;.  Has anyone tried their engines?

Did you search the archives? I am working from memory here and I could 
be wrong, but I think MOFOCO is one of two national vendors who have 
never once had a positive comment posted about them (the other one being 
Parts Place). Even GEX has a few satisfied customers on the record, but 
a some firms cannot even make that simple paltry claim, they are part of 
an elite cadre who have earned nothing but universal condemnation for 
years on end, and I believe MOFOCO is one of them.

Again, there are a LOT of messages in history and I could have missed 
something. But I would have been careful if I were you. And I would 
search the archives.
