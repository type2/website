Subject: Really bad engine probs

I've got a quick question about my engine which has some major problems.
Sometimes when I'm driving I find that the engine will not engage - it's
jolts back and forth as though going through a bad gear change but isn't.
The fuel pumps seems to be leaking as there's gas all around it and the fuel
gauge on the dash jumps all over the place once under 3/4 of a tank.

It's an upright stock 1600 with Solexpict30 carb and stock fuel pumps. Are
these problems related? Are they major? Doe's any one have any thought or
all? It would be greatly appreciated.

Frustrated owner,

Rob
