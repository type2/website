&gt;
&gt;  my high beams won't go off.  I looked at
&gt; the turn signal switch and saw that two brown wires have pulled off the
&gt; switch.  This is on a '71 bus.  I looked at the wire diagram and it looks
&gt; like  a single wire goes to the high-low beam relay.  Is there any way I
can
&gt; bypass the switching of high to low from the turn signal switch?


Jamie,, the headlight switch sends power to the dimmer relay,, and when
you ground the relay via the brown white wire at the turn signal lever,,
the dimmer relay alternates between hi and low beams..

If the brown wire your refering to has a white stipe... then you should be
able to turn on the headlights,, and ground that wire momentarily,, it
will switch the headlights to the &quot;other&quot; beam,, if you ground it again
momentarily,, then it will switch back

iirc
I hope that helps
