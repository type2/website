Subject: Makin' my 78 a camper

Hey Everybody,
I decided to go with metallic purple for my 78 bus.  thanks for all of your
suggestions.
but i've got another question for everybody.  Where can i get a foldout
bed/backseat for my bus.  it isn't a camper or even slightly modified to be
one but i guess while i'm on the subject,  How do i go about making it a
camper?
thanks much

jake vincent
soon to be metallic purple 78(she-ra)
