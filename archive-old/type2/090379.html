&gt; interesting. my speedo seemed dead on when comparing it to a borrowed
&gt; hand-held gps unit.
&gt;
&gt; until about 60 mph. then it went up very fast. i got the speedo up to about
&gt; 77 but the bus was doing almost 70.
&gt;
&gt; wonder if this is normal? don't know the margin of error on that gps unit...

I'd trust the GPS over the mechanical speedo.  VW speedos can vary from
dead on to wildly optomistic.  I wouldn't worry so much about getting the
speedo right as with getting the tire diameter right for the bus.  The
tires are your final gearing and you don't want to be spinning things too
fast or too slow.
