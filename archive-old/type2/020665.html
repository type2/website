G'day brother and sister listfolk &amp; distinguished admins,

I've beed lax in posting updates of life as a full-time bus gypsy and so offer 
this little Friday essay as possible entertainment.

Early this month in an attempt to escape the need for electricity (and heat), 
I drove to Key West. I stayed enroute at two Florida State Parks: 
Collier-Seminole (near Naples) and John Pennekamp in Key Largo (Wow!)

With finances too low to remain in the pricey State Parks in the Keys, and 
with little or no room at the inn anyhow, I opted to spend the next 10-days as 
a vagabond stealth camper (boondocking) in Key West. I spent sun-filled days 
at the beach, and nights in places known to be currently friendly toward 
low-profile overnight parking. Notice I did not say &quot;camping.&quot;

I was quick to discover that boondocking in Key West, in January, is a tricky 
wicket--sort of the &quot;front-lines&quot; of the freebie escapade. I had some good 
coaching though, an enjoyable time, the advantage of Florida tags, and no 
problems.

Inside Buttercup things were peachy also. My previously described dry-docking 
and shakedown cruises near home-base meant there were few surprises and none 
of the mechanical sort. My only inconvenience was the voluntary decision to 
use no interior lights, TV, VCR or other camping give-away amenities at night 
in my chosen sleep-spots.

The goal of the exercise was to awaken in the pre-dawn and return to the 
public beaches or parks before getting underfoot.

For those who don't know, Key West is chock-full of VW buses--so many  in 
fact, that few even wave hello in that environment. Perhaps it's because 
they're all too busy weaving along the narrow streets through the sea of 
mopeds, scooters, pedestrians, and bicycles--all of which are looking at 
things other than where they're going or what color the traffic signal is. 
Here on this 4mi x 2mi island, life's just one big (expensive) party.

When my trusty NOAA weather radio began squawking about some horrendous South 
winds blowing in advance of (yet another) cold front and equally aggressive 
wind shift, I gathered up my quarters, gassed up faithful Buttercup, and got 
out of Dodge. With the brisk tailwind back to Tampa, we managed a cool and 
unexpected 30 mpg along the 400+ mile trip. Awesome mileage. I even *passed* 
somebody! Okay, okay, she had silver hair, a Taurus about the same color, and 
was going less than 55. :-)

I'll stay here in Tampa until this coming week is out--laying low, checking 
e-mail, and avoiding anything Superbowl. After that, I'll be off again to 
parts unknown but I hope warm.

I had only one real bother during the Key West affair and that was one of 
entertaining unexpected and at times marginally unwelcome guests and visitors. 
I wished in some ways to have been driving a vehicle that was a tad less 
personality-magnetic. It seemed I was forever in conversation with people who 
either &quot;used to have one of those&quot; or who now had something bigger for hauling 
more &quot;stuff,&quot; and who wished for the &quot;simpler times&quot; and gas mileage afforded 
by the lowly little and recreationally-passive VW Bus. But the Key West 
environment perfectly suits VW Bus approachability, and I surrendered and made 
the best of being an easy, cheap, and entertaining stop along the partying 
pedestrian route.

To be completely honest and blunt, I had one other problem having to do with 
how to responsibly empty my (wince) porta-potty. Keyword: Responsibly. That 
was before I happened by one of those blue port-a-johns with its door 
invitingly(?) ajar. The environment thought it was a responsible place but the 
port-a-john people surely would have thought otherwise. It was clearly a case 
of it being easier to ask forgiveness than ask permission and neither seemed 
necessary just then.

There is an AIRS listee in Key West but I didn't bother the poor fellow (No, 
I'm not speaking of the port-a-john here).

Posting to this list is not as easy for me as I thought it might be starting 
out, insofar as I have no laptop and the Key West library had a 3-day waiting 
list for computer-time. I predict there's more of that to come at other 
libraries as well.

I've updated my website with some pictures of a pre-trip cosmetic facelift 
given to Buttercup. Have a look:

You may be interested to learn I have encircled the interior roof with an 
all-white string of Christmas lights which run off an inverter (and spare 
battery) bathing the inside of Buttercup in a nice warm indirect lighting 
ambiance. This no-doubt added to her magnetic personality after sunset.

I am loving life here in the slow lane, and am counting the days until things 
warm up and Buttercup and I can venture North and West, armed with a new 
budget that allows each night to be within a National or State Park along the 
way--if that's what I want. Each day I opt to boondock instead, injects a 
small surplus into the monthly &quot;entertainment&quot; coffers. ;-)

Cheers!
