&gt;  &gt;This does, however, indicate that you can manipulate the mixture and

&gt;  &gt;spring.  I don't know if these are available for our engines.  A
&gt;  &gt;slightly rich mixture will give you maximum power but of course will
&gt;  &gt;lower fuel economy.
&gt;  
&gt;  Maximum power is made on the lean side of the curve, not the rich side.
&gt;  Power will fall off as you richen the mixture much beyond stoich.  Most
&gt;  cars go much richer than that at WOT to protect the engine, even though it
&gt;  decreases fuel efficiency and hurts power slightly.  Better to lose 3hp and
&gt;  1mpg than to have to replace engines under warranty, I guess.  Anyway,
&gt;  richening the mixture beyond factory settings will generally decrease
&gt;  horsepower on a stock engine, not increase it.

The Bently FI manual [How to understand, service and modify Bosch Fuel 
Injection &amp; Engine Management by Charles O. Probst, ISBN 0-8376-0300-5] says:-
ideal or stoichiometric air-fuel ratio for combustion is 14.7:1 by mass.
Max power is at 12.6:1 and max economy at 15.4:1

ie max power is at a rich mixture and max economy is at a lean mixture.

The charts also show that richening beyond 12.6:1 will result in loss of 
power.

Those of us with Cats and Lamda sensors will be held in the region of 14.5:1 
and 14.7:1 for max emmissions control and a good compromise between 
drivability and ecconomy. A fuel-air mixture out of that boundary will damage 
the Catalytic convertor!

In the section on modifications increasing the pressure is one of the ways 
suggested to increase power; but there is also a warning that this extra load 
can cause pump failure or leaks and there is other work suggested to be done 
to correctly do this apparently simple change correctly.

This Bently FI manual has been refered to on the list by others in the past 
and I would recomend it as being a 'good read' (even for those with carbs). 
It explains fuel delivery and its effects in an understandable way; clearly 
presents the manner in which FI works; and goes on to offer guidence for 
basic maintenance.

Good luck
