&gt; I was not selling, this was a FREE OFFER at my cost.  Just like the
hosting

&gt; this isn't about money?!
&gt;

From this point of view you have made a truly commendable effort.  I have a
pretty good idea of how much work it takes, having done a similar project
for another list.

&gt; Second, the reasons are to allow people to develop their own search
&gt; interfaces, at least two people have approached me to do so.  I also have
&gt; seen other reasons such as people on laptops where there is no Internet
&gt; access and their bus is broken down.  Think of it like the book you
&gt; reference.

People developing their own search engines for the database is one of those
rose-lined paths that may lead to big problems.  When I wrote my search
engine, I had to consider whether the authors would want to be in a
searchable index.  Suppose you do a
&quot;select * from messages where body like '%Russell Barr%'&quot;;
You get back all the messages with my name in them.  In thinking about it, I
can't be sure everyone would welcome that kind of scrutiny.  If I were doing
the search myself, it would be a kind of neat, ego gratification thing, but
if it were someone else searching for my name I'd find it kind of creepy and
possibly even intrusive.  Suppose someone does a full-text search for
'broken doorlocks' or 'spare key' or 'oem supercharger'?  With the cdrom
version, they'll have all the time in the world to go through the results.
Of course they could have done that with the online version, but I presume
you would at least have their IP address from the server logs or session
data.
With a book, there may be collaboration among multiple authors, but it is
worked out beforehand, and the off-topic stuff never makes it to print, so
could never be taken out of context.

While I may share Ken's viewpoint on this issue, I am a database programmer
by profession and If I were in your shoes, I'd be heartbroken.

Obligatory bus content:
I bought a '69 Riviera 2 years ago, right before unsubscribing and going
back to school.  I resubscribed just yesterday, since I'm done with school.
I drive it my bus daily, shuttling my 4 kids here and there and everywhere.
I've replaced the starter, battery, and some other non-ignition-related
switches, but get this: It's still running the same points that were in it
when I bought it.  Can anyone beat that?
