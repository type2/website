Subject: Re: [T2] Understanding AFC fuel injection--question

Adam,
Look at it this way, it's just like opening the throttle valve a little
more, which in turn will let more air in, which will deflect the AFM
flap and give more fuel.  As that valve closes, less air is allowed to
bypass the throttle valve, and the engine slows down.. but because it's
warm, it's able to run at the lower air setting.  The air that goes
through the aux air regulator and the air that go through the throttle
valve both come from the same place.

The aux air regulator is just like opening your idle screw when the
engine's cold.  But the Aux air regulator is a little more advanced that
it has a built in heater that closes itself after a given time/temp.  In
addition, there is the cold-start valve to give more gas at startup,
which also has it's own internal heater to turn it off at a certain
temp/time.

Lastly, there is a temperature sensor built inside the AFM and there is
also the temp sensor on the heads.  Now, these are both on the 76-79
models, so I'm guessing the same or similar with the later models.

&gt; Volks,
&gt; I just spent the better part of the day diagnosing my fuel injection on my 81 and am back where i started.
&gt; 
&gt; I have an official vw AFC book, as well.  What I do not get is the process when it is starting cold.....air flows thru the AFM, and if the motor is cold enough, the auxillary air regulator is open, and air is diverted to the intake manifold, thus bypassing the throttle body.  This book says that this enables the motor to act the same cold as it does hot, for the control unit adds additional fuel to the injectors when it senses the engine is cold.  Now, there is no sensor, or anything on the throttle body, so how does this auxillary air regulator do anything?  The air still ends up in the intake manifold and thus diverted to the cylinders anyway..................I could see it doing something if it were unregulated air, but it is regulated at the AFm.................
