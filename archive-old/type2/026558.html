Subject: RE:  Ball Joints on 1973 Bus
Message-ID: &lt;D3C18AEA0EA1D111B8DA00805F85E889011F914D_at_dsntexsrv3.diasham_dot_com&gt;

&gt;I recently brought my 1973 Bus in for a checkup, and the mechanics 
&gt;at the VW garage told me I needed to replace all 4 ball joints in the
&gt;front.  

Anyone with a 20 year old bus should take a gander at their ball joints from
time to time.  The rubber boots get split and the grease goes away.  Then
you've got a ball-and-socket joint (put your fist in the palm of your other
hand and move it around - that's what a ball joint looks and acts like)
rubbing around with no lubrication.  Symptoms of badly worn joints include
loud clunks when turning into parking lots and not-enough-then-too-much
turning when navigating curvy roads.

&gt;Is this an impossible job, or can I do this myself?   I was told by 
&gt;the mechanics that this is a difficult job, to only be done by
&gt;professionals, and that perhaps a blow torch might be needed to 
&gt;extract them.

I replaced mine a few years ago and wrote up the whole thing.  The write-up
can be found at the type2_dot_com resource library by clicking on 'Library' then
'Suspension'.  Scroll down a bit and you'll see 'Ball Joint Replacement by
Mike Gensler'.  You'll also find at the same place an article from Steve
Denis and Al Brase about removing the joints from the arms.  In reading my
article, you'll find that I left that step up to the VW shop, but you make
that decision yourself.  If you can't get to the page, e-mail me and I'll
send my write up to you.
