Christopher,
Because I do my own work I can't give you a recommendation based upon 
personal experience. However there is a consumer magazine in the Bay Area, 
Consumer Checkbook, that surveys its subscribers and then publishes results 
on various types of businesses. The last time they reported on auto repair 
shops was in Fall, 1997. At that time there were two shops in San Francisco 
that specialized in import cars (including VW) that received top marks for 
quality and price: AVR Service and A-1 Continental Car Service. On the 
Peninsula there is Fred's Garage in Redwood City, similarly rated and a bit 
lower hourly labor charge than the other two.
The malfunction you describe (rough idle/dying) may be related to a leak 
into the air manifold which allows air to enter without passing thru the AFM 
and thus causes a too lean mixture. So, if you would check all the hoses and 
connections downwind from the AFM box you might well solve the problem 
yourself. A very brief spritz of starter fluid at each connection will help 
reveal a leak because the idle speed will momentarily jump up if there is a 
leak at that spot. Crank open the idle speed screw enough to get the engine 
to idle on its own in order to do this test.
I'm located about 13 miles futher south of Redwood City, but would be glad 
to have a look at your '75, because I have the same year model. Besides I'm 
a member of A.I.R.S. and thus you have a standing invitation.
Roland Finston, Palo Alto
