Subject: [T2] Air conditioning

Hello out there,

We're the people driving from Toronto to Mexico next year. We'll be
leaving
July 2nd. My concern is the intense heat experienced in the southern
states
during that time of year, especially Texas- 100 degrees+ during the day.
We
have a '76 Bus with no air conditioner and we will be traveling with two
children,
one 9 years old the other 1 year.

I'm wondering if anybody knows of a makeshift a.c. or an alternative
a.c.
or a cheap a.c.!
Thanks for any help.
