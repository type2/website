Subject: [T2] paging Steve Dolan...


I was just browsing the list on the web &amp; saw Steve was on a rescue
mission to Atlanta...

If any of you talk to him (Raistrick or John Anderson, etc.) tell him to
give me a call.  I sent him an email, but he is probably on the road...

I wanted to offer assistance if I could.  At the very least, I could
offer a beer.
