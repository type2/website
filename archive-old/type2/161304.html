Subject: Re: [T2] Leaky cold start valve?

Hi JJ,

With FI issues you will waste a LOT of time and $$$ if you don't  
follow the manufacturers procedures for troubleshooting.

They can be found in the FI manuals online at www.ratwell_dot_com. Start  
with a tune-up and valve adjustment, and verify that you have correct  
vacuum at idle.

If it's a CA-spec 79 engine then it could be a failure of the O2  
sensorr. If not I would suggest you verify operation of the fuel  
pressure regulator and the head temp sensor.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; I'm still diagnosing the running problem on my '79, which seems to be
&gt; loading up on fuel after a few minutes of running to the point of
&gt; ceasing to do so. My father and I spent some time poking around this
&gt; weekend. He's wondering if the valve has failed or is leaking, and he
&gt; suggested I try bypassing the coldstart valve with a length of fuel
&gt; line to see if that's the case.
