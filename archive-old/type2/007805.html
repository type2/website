Subject: RE: Type I in a late model bus?

&gt;There are a lot of reasons not to change to the type 1 engine. In my
&gt; opinion a type 1 engine in a loaf used in the US under normal
&gt; circumstances is only good for 100,000 km (61k miles). A good stock
&gt; 17-18-2000cc type 4 engine should last close to twice that. 


I would argue that a change to a type one is ok for saving money!
A lot more bugs have been on the road, and the parts are cheap. A
well built 1600 will not cost as much to repair or change.
And I think 61,000 miles is a very low number. I have two friends who
have clocked 200,000 miles on their Type 1's in busses. At that point
they needed rebuilding, but they lasted that long. I usually will
be conservative and give the type 1 about 100,000 in a bus. I've done
it. By the way, one of the busses is a 74 with european conversion. Why
did he do it? Cheap, cheap, cheap. New heads, new case, whatever, it is
much cheaper than a type IV.

On another note...I purchased a 70 westy a year ago. Decided to pull 
engine to replace the main seal. Good idea, but of course that led to 
replacing all seals, the pushrod tubes, converting to a doghouse, 
installing
electronic ignition and temp sensor, and now I am thinking about new 
rings!
Once they are out you just can't stop! By the way, to tie this to the 
above
message, removal took all of about 15 minutes, a seal kit is about $10,
new pushrod tubes about $12. Installation back into the bus will take 
about half an hour at most. Now could this be why I like the 1600 Type 
I?
