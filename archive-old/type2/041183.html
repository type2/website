&gt; Well, does anyone have a list of all of the tools that you should have if you
&gt; own a VW Bus?

As the old saying goes, &quot;your mileage may vary.&quot; Are you just planning to do
basic maintenance and upkeep, or are you starting with a bus with a seized
engine and lotsa little dents?

I don't think you can go wrong with having the following:
Set of 1/4&quot; drive sockets with 1/4&quot; ratchet--Sears has 'em
Set of 1/2&quot; drive sockets with 1/2&quot; ratchet
Inch-lb and 1/2&quot; drive micrometer-adjust torque wrenches
1/4&quot; drive nutdriver handle
Flex-head breaker bar and three feet of pipe that fits it
Rear axle nut removal tool
Set of end wrenches up to at least 24mm (the nuts that hold the front wheel
bearings on are 24mm)
Set of Allen wrenches and a 17mm Allen wrench or a transmission plug
removing socket
A 2-lb hammer (get a claw hammer, they come in real handy)
Set of flat-tip and Phillips screwdrivers
Oil filter wrench
CV joint removing socket (12-point stardriver), which also works on the fan
bolts on a Type 4 engine
Floor jack and two pairs of jackstands
Three feet of the smallest-diameter fuel hose your local FLAPS has--this is
for bleeding brakes--and a little jar
Pair of vise-grips
Crescent wrench
Duct tape. You must have duct tape.
OIl drain pan and a 5-gallon can to store used oil in for transportation to
the oil collection station.
Container to wash parts in
Various pliers--channellocks, needlenose, circlip...
Pocket knife
Digital multimeter. Get one from Home Depot.
Crimping pliers for push-on connectors
Wire cutters
Timing light and dwell-tachometer
Case of Scott Shop Towels in a Box
Goggles, hearing protection, first aid supplies
Fire extinguisher. The one you are carrying in your Bus (you are carrying
one in your bus, right?) is good.
Muir and Bentley manuals.

Like Muir said, tools come as you need 'em.
