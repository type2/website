Subject: exhaust/heater box question

Well I had to patch another hole in my tailpipe today and have decided
it is time to drop some cash for a new exaust system.  Ouch- those
heater boxes are pricey.  I am wondering if anyone knows of a way I can
get around buying heater boxes since I never use my heat anyway.  Is
there some kind exaust pipe sold that will take the exaust directly to
the muffler?  If not how about a place that I can find cheap/quality
heater boxes?
Thanks
