I plan to drive my newly acquired '73 Bus from its
current home in So Cal to
my home in the Frisco bay area. About 350+ miles. This
is my first aircooled automobile.

Assuming the vehicle is in reasonable running
condition is there anything I should do difference
&gt;from what I would do if I were making this trip in a
water-cooled car?

----

I would make sure I had plenty of extra oil, in case
it is an oil burner or leaker (change the oil and
filter before leaving too).  Take along a spare fan
belt, accelerator cable, and clutch cable (I try to
always have spares of these in all my aircooled VWs),
and take a tool kit with tools needed to change the
belt or cables.  Also take your Bentley manual for the
vehicle, or at least a Haynes manual if you didn't get
the Bentley yet.  Put some rags, paper towels, and
hand cleaner in there too.  Make sure the spare tire
is good and that the jack is there and works.  (I just
had a tire fly apart 100 miles from home, heading away
&gt;from home, last Thursday evening, and I was really
glad I had checked the spare earlier in the day,
including loosening the nuts holding it to the tire
mount on the nose of the bus, and that I had a good
jack under the seat.)
Good luck on the trip.
