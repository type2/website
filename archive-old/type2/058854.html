Subject: Re: Rear Side Vent Windows

I've been waiting nearly two years for this seal (lesson: don't cut out an old seal until you know you can get a new one!) I finally gave up and bought the one-piece window out of a junker and did away with the vent window. I hated to do it, but I've waited long enough. WCM told me back in the spring that the seal would be available in June, and took my name and # and were supposed to call when it came in- I never heard from them. I believe the seal for the fixed glass is available, but not for the vent window. The seal for the one piece window is available, I got mine from Bus Depot. With the fixed glass out, the vent window pulls right out. I also replaced my sink water pump this weekend, anybody got any suggestions on how to keep it from leaking? Its got a slow drip, even though I coated the threads with a caulk and its in the bottom of the tank as tight as I can get it. Thanks to the Bus Depot for the parts! Jeff
