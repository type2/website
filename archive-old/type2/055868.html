Subject: wiring weirdness

Does anyone have a feel for how accurate the Bentley is re: wiring
diagrams? The chart that shows which fuses protect which circuits bears
almost no relation to the reality of my fuse box. And I'm getting some
weird fuse blowing. For example, when I turn on my left blinker, no prob.
When I turn on my right blinker, the fuse for the &quot;interior light&quot;
(according to Bentley) blows. So, do I start pulling wires in the hope that
I can get everything lined up, or is this one of those areas in which St.
Bentley erred?

P.S. If anyone out there had a 70 owner's manual and could list, 1-12,
which fuses are for which circuits, I'll send you a free (small, i.e.
mailable) part of your choice from my 71 Deluxe, provided I've still got
it.

Hurry, this offer is limited. First come first served,
Bob
