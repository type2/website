&gt; Hi Andy,     We havn't priced them yet since we havn't actually got
&gt; them
&gt; finished and in production. I  havn't yet tallied all the costs but I
&gt; think
&gt; they will be in the 1200 dollar range. If you are building a big
&gt; engine this
&gt; cas will take the power and won't crack like the stockers (or the
&gt; welded up
&gt; stock cases)
&gt; We should be done with engine tests and  be ready to sell cases by the
&gt; end
&gt; of July if all goes well.
