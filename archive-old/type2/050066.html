Subject: Re: [T2] Autoclub?

It depends upon you.  If you find that you need frequent tows, then AAA is
a good idea.  Many people keep it for peace of mind.  I've probably lost
money over the the years, since I've only needed one tow in 20+ years.
The maps are nice, the tourbooks are useless (IMO) and in california the
fact that they handle DMV services is very nice.  Their insurance is
overpriced.  They have an unfortunate tendancy to support any new law that
might improve their insurance company profits, such as those that
discourage the use of older vehicles.

The best &quot;auto clubs&quot; for the bus owner are NEATO/LIMBO and AIRS.  It's
much more comforting to call upon someone who knows your vehicle and local
sources for its needs than somebody who considers a VW bus &quot;weird.&quot;
