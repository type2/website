Subject: Timing strangeness

I sat down at my '77 Bus yesterday to check her timing.  I've never done
this before, so I got comfortable and got my book out.  I clipped the timing
light on the #1 plugwire, and clipped it to the battery.  My wife started it
up, and I proceeded to check the timing.  Long and short of it is the timing
mark oscillates between 8' and 4' BTDC.  I expected to see it pretty steady,
but mine was jumping around.

I've also noticed it idoling a bit rougher, and having much less pickup
these days.  It's a fuel injected model, and I just adjusted the valves.

Any ideas?
