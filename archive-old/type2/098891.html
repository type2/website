Subject: Stinky heat

Before I left Austin for the colder places of the world I repaired the heating system:

- cracked hoses in engine compartment
- replaced 16A burned fuse for fan
- adjusted the cables to the flapper boxes and putting the engine back in
- located missing plate that joins the heat exchanger to the fan shroud that was venting the heat to the outside. #26 in this image:

Now that it's cold enough here I've tried the heat and although I'm getting heat (actually a lot in the center compartment from the holes in the floor behind the seats), the smell isn't pleasant and it's aggrivates the sore throat I currently have.

What's a typical smell?
