Subject:      [vanagon] Van Christmas Presents?? (fwd)

this got started on the Vanagon list ... :)

From:   &quot;Malcolm Stebbins&quot; &lt;Malcolm.Stebbins_at_MSVU.Ca&gt;
&gt;Just wondering what people purchased as presents for your van this
&gt;season??  My partner thinks I'm nuts, but I bought, wrapped, and under
&gt;the tree:  A new dash compass, fold up drink holders, and an
&gt;inside/outside thermometer.  God love Canadian Tire!

on the Twelfth Day of Christmas, my true love gave to me ...

TWELVE drums for braking,
ELEVEN pipes exhausting,
TEN doors with hinges,
NINE rocker panels,
EIGHT wiper motors,
SEVEN springs a springing
SIX windows leaking,
FIVE pis-ton rings ...
FOUR torsion bars,
THREE wrist pins,
TWO working gloves,
and a cartridge for my grease gun

:)

unca joel
have a happy follydays, folks. :)
