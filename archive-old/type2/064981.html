Subject: Re: kendall oil..what about head temps?

In my limited experience with Cylinder Head Temp &amp; Oil Temp gauges, 
I have found that the two measure very different conditions.  The 
CHT measures temps as a result of the combustion process, the OT 
measures the temps of the oil as heat from the engine is transfered 
to the oil, &amp; the oil is cooled and recirculated through the engine 
to continuously cool the engine parts (as well as lubricate them).

Cylinder Head Temp seems to be dependent on engine LOAD.  The temp 
is much higher doing 50mph at full load going uphill than it is 
doing 50mph going downhill.  CHT is not as dependent on ambient 
temperature as Oil Temp.

Oil Temp seems to be much more dependent on RPMs.  On my single cab 
there seems to be a &quot;sweet spot&quot; or &quot;threshold&quot; where at a certain 
RPM the oil temp really shoots up quick.  Oil temp below this 
threshold also seems to be more dependant on ambient temperature 
(which makes sense, since cooler air will be able to transfer more 
heat from the oil cooler).

So I don't think these two temps will give you the answer you are 
looking for.  For an oil to meet these claims, it would have to be 
able to absorb more heat from the engine than other oils and be 
able to transfer more heat to air at the oil cooler.  To my way of 
thinking (and I am *no genius* at thermodynamics) these properties 
may be mutually exclusive.

&gt;i was discussing the kendall oil phenomenon with stefan today. okay, 
&gt;everyone's oil is showing lower temps. does anyone who is running 
&gt;this oil have head temp gauges installed as well? i can believe the 
&gt;oil is cooler but i'm having a hard time believing that the engine 
&gt;itself is a lot cooler. the heat has to go somewhere. so...if ya got 
&gt;a head temp gauge and an oil gauge...is the head temp alot lower as 
&gt;well?
