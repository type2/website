X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

I hope this is appropriate for Friday discussion. I am interested in a
Type 82 Kublewagen.  A company in Albuquerque, NM makes kits that look
pretty close. I am wondering if anybody has experience with this
company or these type of kits in general.

I also have a novice question to ask about my 2.0l converted Weber/009
combo.  The original dizzy came with the bus.  Am I correct in
guessing the Weber is not compatible with it?  Winter and 009s are a
drag...

thanks kindly
