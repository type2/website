Hi Volks,

I want start out by saying that I've enjoyed my 3 years or so on this list
immensely. A finer bunch of helpful, sharing, clever and knowledgeable folks
couldn't be found anywhere. Although the only personal contact I've had with
any listees is the time I spent with the ubiquitous Charlie Ford, I feel
like I have a kinship with many others and hopefully will met some of you
someday.

I haven't used a Vdub for a daily driver for about four years now mostly
because from an economic standpoint it is not very practical for me to do so
in this area.........no junkers, no mechanics no real support of any kind.
We had a shop that specialized in VWs but  they closed up. Within a couple
of years most all  of the VWs were gone off the streets.
  Truckin' around and camping in a Westy is a great pleasure but at this
point its not realistic for us anymore (wonder if it ever was and if I
really cared). You all know that this pleasure doesn't come cheap. Our trips
are longer and the time we have is shorter so we take the easy way and climb
into our eminently reliable oriental transportation device.... highball down
the freeway, get there and back..no fuss no muss. Kinda ho-hum traveling...
getting there has become less then half the fun  thats for sure.

Anyway, I'm selling off my bus and the bus stuff that I have.

'78 Westy deluxe 4speed..... new  2.0L hyd lifter low compression long block
from Protech in California with new clutch assembly
standard Weber 2 bbl setup..  Compufire in a 009...electric fuel pump.. many
other new parts
This motor has only been run for about 10 minutes (ran into some electrical
and dizzy glitches.. and so it sits)
Complete original interior with tables, screens and curtains stove fridge
etc. pretty decent...  with good canvas.
Wisconsin body ( skin rust in the usual places and ratty paint) but its
straight and never been hit... axle beams solid and always greased
I'll just stop here ...pmail or call for the rest of the story if
interested.

I'd like around $1800.00 for it

Bus is located in Fountain City Wisconsin....100 miles south of
Minneapolis/St Paul

Charlie Ford has seen this bus and he would probably tell you that it
appears that care was taken with the engine assembly and the quality of the
parts used. Then again he might tell you its a piece of crap.... either way
it will be an unbiased opinion I'm sure.

I also have a good auto tranny and bad motor from a '74 and other misc.
parts.

Well thats the story.  No more bussin for this guy in the foreseeable
future. I've owned Volksie for 30 years and I'm not ever going to not own
one so........ I plan to pick up a dune buggy next spring to play with and
fix up. Should be great fun! Never owned one yet. If someone can tell me
where the buggy folks hang out on the net I'd appreciate it.
