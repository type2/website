Dear Mike.

At the moment, I'm not too sure about your part numbers, both of which 
appear to be VW Type 1. My 1973 VW Type 2, has VW Type 3 &amp; 4 switches; 
including the heated rear window switch I fitted. Check these out, as a 
possible alternative! Your aluminium screw collar for the switch, might have 
the wrong sized hole.

Regards.

P.S. Have you got any spare 2.5mm thick, white nylon spacers with brass 
electrical spade connection? They are only fitted to the dashboard heater 
control lever pivot studs, of the 1972-79 VW 17/18/2000 Type 2, plus 
possibly some VW Type 3s &amp; 4s. I want some for my 1973 VW 1600 Type 2, which 
were never equipped with these, owing to the lack of an electric heater 
booster fan.
