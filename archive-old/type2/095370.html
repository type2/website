Subject: bay area locksmith


The easy way to get an ignition key is for you to pull the lock and retrieve 
the code.  Not knowing the year of your bus, I can't give you a ton of 
information, but be aware that some of the ignition locks are NOT rekeyable. 
  From the code number, most any locksmith can make a key.  The lock is 
difficult to generate a key for without making it by code.  I'm not saying 
it can't be done, just difficult.  I can offer you the key from code by 
mail, if you pull the lock.  If it is one of the rekeyable types, I can also 
rekey it, or offer you a replacement lock keyed as you require on an 
exchange basis.  I'll be glad to help if possible.
