&gt;I went to a tool place the other day and saw (not kidding here) a padded 
&gt;seat you attach to the trailer hitch.  A small mod would make it fit the 
&gt;hitch on the back of the bus.  Add a garbage bag lined bucket and a curtain 
&gt;(queen sized bedsheets work well) and you're set.

Why go to all the effort of fabricating things yourself, just buy one

I can't remember how I found this thing when I was wandering around the Net, 
but some things you don't forget ( no matter HOW much you'd like to ) ;^)
