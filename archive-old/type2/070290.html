&gt;&gt;And my turn signals are mounted high on the front panel at either end 
&gt;&gt;of the front air intake grill.  Is the article wrong or do I have a 
&gt;&gt;Westfalia.

&gt;Offhand, it sounds like a '72.  What is the VIN number?  Is there a
&gt;manufacture date on a sticker behind the driver's seat (maybe passenger seat,
&gt;I forget).  Does it have an upright/type I engine or a pancake/type IV
&gt;engine?


Nope! I have an early '72 and a friend has a later '72. We both have the low
front turn sigs. We have pancake engines and no hatch over the engine
compartment. He DOES have lights on the dash indicating &quot;heat&quot; and &quot;vent,&quot;
whereas I only have the blue and red knobs to clue me in. He's also got a
pop-top and a heater :-(

Check your serial #. Per Bently, Kombi's and Campmobiles in 1972 range from 232
2000 001 to 232 2300 000.

It's entirely possible that the front skin was replaced at one time to repair
the results of a suicidal deer. I've *never* seen a wrap around bumper with turn
sigs up high. Check the bottom edge of the front skin (just below and behind the
bottom edge of the bumper). Compare its condition with the rest of the body.
Does it look a lot newer?
