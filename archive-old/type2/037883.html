Subject: Re: ideas to keep the bus

First off, what touched off this thread was Ken's posting of a 23-window 
Splitty with fresh paint. A vehicle with fresh paint can be freshly 
repainted, and VINs are a dime a dozen in San Diego county. Parking such 
an attractive vehicle at a mall was not such a good idea. 

Our baywindows are a lot less attractive, but vehicles don't need to be 
attractive to attract theft.

The way to hold on to your bus is to think in terms of percentages. Some 
percentage of would-be thieves will be detered by a club, so you use a 
club. Some percentage of thieves won't bother trying to &quot;fix&quot; a bus that 
won't start. And so on.

As Clark and George have pointed out, tow trucks and flatbeds get around 
most of these devices, and do not look the slightest bit suspicious. When 
I was in high school, many years ago, I solved the problem of getting 
from my usual hangout in the music wing of my school to the Coke machine 
in the cafeteria: I would push a piano through the halls. No one asks 
someone who is pushing a piano for a hall pass. This is the teenage mind 
at work. It's the All-American can-do spirit.

To work that percentage, I think you have to do a combination of things:

1. When you are &quot;out,&quot; park where you can see the bus. 

2. Permanently install a bicycle -- not a beater, but not a good bike 
either -- on the back of the bus and lock it up. Have a quick-release on 
the seat. Give opportunistic thieves something to diddle with.

3. Behave erratically. Some small percentage of thieves pay attention to 
drivers' habits, and take advantage of them.

4. Get to know everyone in your neighborhood and be a good neighbor. Make 
it clear that you are watching out for them. If a car alarm goes off 
accidentally, do a 100-yard dash to the scene instead of ignoring it. 

5. Move to a place where you can park with more security.

6. If you park on the street for days at a time, you might as well paint 
&quot;steal this bus&quot; on the side of your vehicle.

In the neighborhood where I live, there was a rash of car stripping at 
one point. People would go out and find their BMW on blocks, with all 
kinds of parts missing from it. The only way to stop that sort of thing 
is to pay attention, and get the police interested. 

Eventually, though, you get to the point where worrying about theft makes 
owning a bus pointless. You want to park it at the trailhead and hike for 
hours, but you're afraid to leave the bus. Then why have a bus?

I am actually at that point. One of my reasons for getting Peregrine was 
the notion that I would drive down to the beach, or up into the 
mountains, and ride for an hour on my bike. But I don't, because I won't 
park it that long.

Bummer.
