Subject: RE: [T2] Westfalia goes thru tree

Richard,

You may want to rethink the whole water test thing with the bra on
if you can avoid it.  I have several friends in various states of
duress due to leaving their bra's on their vehicles during the rainy
season.  Water tends to make them cling to the vehicle and any road
dust that got under the bra turns into an abrasive at that point and
will damage the paint.  I went to a body shop guy I know and his
opinion was that a bra should be used primarily in a dry climate.
Although often there is no way to keep it dry when the rain catches
you while on the road.  Anybody else on this list have any
experiences with bra's of the vehicle variety damaging paint?
