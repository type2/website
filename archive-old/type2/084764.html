Subject: Casper gets Smashed

Many of you have seen Casper
http://freeweb.pdq_dot_net/perring/casper.htm
and may remember how nice he looked just a few days before Mary Beth and I 
started out in him for our 7 month and 25,000 mile Great Western Adventure 
last May.

I had pulled the fuel tank, pulled the engine, coated the battery trays, 
and other long term jobs of reconditioning and trip preparedness.

Well, Casper had a mishap in Alaska with a BIG rented RV driven by some 
travelling Germans.

The story is long.
The memory is painful.
I'll manage to put it to text in due course.
Here are the results of the rear banger.

In the pictures, you will see:
The replacement engine hatch I found in far Northern BC.
The replacement second (red) engine tin I found in Alaska.
The replacement top engine tin I found in Alberta.
The replacement bumper mounts I found in Alaska.
The replacement old style bumper over-riders and rear lights and trim are 
not shown in the pictures. These also came from the Yukon.

Casper has gained a bit more International charm, I would suppose.

Now to get him all fixed up.

I welcome thoughts from those of you in the know as to advice or comfort.
I can use both.
Please tell me what you see ain't so bad.
I keep telling myself this, but would welcome the same words from others.

PS
Casper's front area got a bit hurt, as well.
Big rock in the window............. Texas Good Old Boy driven BIG RV in Alaska.
Big rock in the left vent glass..... Canadian truck rock tosser..  (Found 
one 2 hours and 75 miles later down the road)
and............
Another BIG RV smack .... (Canadian backed up 15 feet down a hill and hit 
Casper before finally getting into first gear. Used his rear mounted 
bicycle to dimple Casper's grin.
