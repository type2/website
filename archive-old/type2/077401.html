Subject: adjustable beam woes

Guys &amp; Gals,

I have a 1977 Sunroof bus that I bought in '94. I lowered it via a BusBoys
adjustable beam in '95 and threw on a pair of KYB gas shocks (specific to
lowered vehicles).

Then a friend of mine bought a '79 lowered bus with the same set-up.

BUT, his front-end seems much less bouncier than mine. My bus feels like it
has slinkys under all the tires when I hit a bump. It feels like I have no
suspension (sorta like when an American car has bad shocks, it just keeps
bouncing like Tigger)

His is solid and takes bumps real nice.

What could the differences be? Could the torsion bars not be set properly in
the beam? Are there any visual checks or is there a website that details the
adjuster installation? I would just like to know more about this sunject so
that I can take a closer look at my beam and determine what is not set
properly.

FWIW, the rest of the front-end is stock, with exception of the 15&quot; Mercedes
rims.
