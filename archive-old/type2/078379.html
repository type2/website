Subject: **TRIPLE** Listmember Discount - TOMORROW ONLY

Listfolk,

I'm going to try something new tomorrow. It may be the only time I do it; I
really don't know yet.

During the off-season (December thru March), we actually have a slow day
here and there. I'm not being sarcastic; it really is an extreme rarity.
During most of the year, we can barely keep up with daily demand (a
&quot;problem&quot; for which I owe all of you a great bit of thanks). But on a rare
day here and there, everything just lines up to make a slow day.  Sales
volume is seasonally low, no big shipments are due to arrive that day, the
computer didn't crash, no one called in sick, and it looks like most of our
existing orders will make it out the door early in the day.  I never know
when a day like that will happen until the night before, at best.

Since we have &quot;excess capacity&quot; on those days, so to speak, it makes good
business sense to fill that capacity, even if it means reducing prices.  So
that's exactly what I'm going to do.

Tomorrow (Thursday) will be the first, and maybe last, Listmember
Appreciation Day.  Tomorrow, all listmembers get TRIPLE listmember
discounts. That means 15% off of our discounted price, on all items that
normally qualify for listmember discounts (which is most items, with a
minimum $50 qualifying purchase; details and exclusions are recapped below).
Also, I will allow a 5% listmember discount on Sale items (items on the
website Bargains Page or in the Late Breaking News insert sent with our
catalogs), which normally do not get any listmember discount at all.

This discount will run us dangerously close to selling below cost, depending
on what people order. That's why I'm not sure if I'll be able to repeat the
offer.  I'll have to look closely and make sure that I didn't actually LOSE
money at those prices.  Also, to that end, there will be a few rules and
exclusions, which are listed under this email.  Sorry to have to put a few
conditions on the offer, but please understand that at 15% off I'm
dangerously close to losing money, so I have to be a little bit cautious if
we are to make this work.

You can order via the website, order desk (by part number only), or customer
service. To get the price, you MUST ask for the Triple Discount when
ordering by phone.  If you order via the phone, the discount will be
calculated right then and there and we can give you your new total.  If
ordering via the website, put TRIPLE DISCOUNT in the &quot;comments&quot; section of
the order form and we will manually adjust the price prior to shipping (even
though the discount will not show up on the website). Sale ends tomorrow
night (at 7 pm via phone and 11 pm via internet, eastern time). But it may
be better to order early as some popular items may sell out.

This would be a good time to stock up on &quot;staples&quot; such as filters, tune up
parts, belts, etc. Think about what you might need in the spring and grab it
now while the price is low. And take a look at the website Bargains Page, as
this will be your only chance to &quot;double dip&quot; and get an additional 5% off
of those Sale prices (since they are normally excluded from all further
discounts).

If this doesn't kill me too badly, I'll try to spring another one on you
here and there when a slow day comes up. There may be one a month, or a few
a month, or none at all, depending on how things go.  We'll see...

TRIPLE DISCOUNT OFFER RULES:
1) Min. qualifying order $50 plus shipping. May not be combined with any
other offer or discount.
2) Offer excludes engines, rebuilt heads, transmissions, and gift
certificates.
3) Sale items and Bargain Page items will get a 5% discount during this day
only (normally they do not qualify at all.)
4) Made-to-order items such as upholstery, carpet, and TMI products will get
a 5% discount.
5) Offer good while supplies last. Items that cannot be shipped within 1-2
days will be deleted from the order, not backordered.
6) I reserve the right to contact you if for some reason an order is
glaringly below cost. Unlikely to happen, but I want the right of refusal
just so I don't lose my shirt.
7) Only orders actually placed on the sale day will qualify for the
discount. Prior or existing in-house orders will not qualify (even if you
cancel and reorder, which would create a major hassle for my employees,
defeat the purpose of this experiment, and ensure that we would not be able
to do it again). Price quote requests, emailed inquiries other than actual
shopping cart orders, etc. will not count as orders; you must actually place
the firm order on the day of the offer.
8) Expedited orders (next-day, second-day, etc.) must be placed via Customer
Service ONLY to qualify for this discount, not via the website or Order
Desk.
9) In the event that we get  absolutely hammered with orders, I will
prioritize expedited orders and full-price orders over triple-discount ones,
which may add a day or so to the delivery time.
