Subject: anyone travelling between Portland OR &amp; Bellingham WA?


My friend and I are in need of a ride between Portland OR &amp; Bellingham
WA on 7/18 or 7/19.  We're good for gas money, talkin' shop, and are
both experienced roadside mechanics.  We both own buses, but are looking
to make the journey in another's bus to make the weekend more
interesting (it's not often that I get to be a passenger!).  We both
have bikes we would like to transport, and can break them down.  (I also
have access to a bike rack if necessary.)  Drop me a line if you're
headed that way and would enjoy the company.  Easy on/off of I-5 both in
Portland and Bellingham (less than 1mi).

Thanks
-Roger
