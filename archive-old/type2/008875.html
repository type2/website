Well, it works well in terms of the amount of heat produced, but is IMHO a
BAD idea. 

With a heat exchanger setup you may get smells and fumes, but with air
direct from the engine you are assured that every smell and fume will find
it's way into the cabin. (You will know about gas and oil leaks right away,
however.) Smells may be merely annoying, but the fumes (including the
odorless-tasteless ones) may be life-threatening. 

The real danger is exhaust gases, from head gasket leaks,
head-to-exhaust-coupling or exhaust system leaks. And, if concentrations of
these ugly gases are not high enough to cause immediately noticable brain
damage (or death), you may instead gradually lose brain cells over time,
until one day your friends and family are talking about how you &quot;used to
be.&quot; 

If the heat exchanger arrangement doesn't cut it, please opt for a gas
heater. Air direct from the engine is much too dangerous.
