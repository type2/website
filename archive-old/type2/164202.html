Subject: Re: rocker

Sorry for being so late in responding but I think Scott pretty well covered
it.  First all bay rockers are a pain in the A$$ to install. On the
passenger's side it needs to be there, on the driver's side you might can
get away with it. Personally I wouldn't but I'm picky like that. I only want
to do something once and not have it bite me in the a$$ later. I hope this
helps, but it's your bus and your call.  Try OEVEEDUB for the middle one you
need. They might have it. later
