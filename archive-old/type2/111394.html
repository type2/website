Subject: Re: [T2] PopTop Refinished...body paint question 

&gt; Next question: Is there some OTHER paint system that is a candidate for 
&gt; application with a roller and brush? When I talked to a boat painter, along 
&gt; with the Pettit line he also recommended DuPont Imron. OK, on the web I 
&gt; looked into Imron products and found at least 5 different varieties 
&gt; (numbered down from 6000) and I obviously can't use any judgement in 
&gt; picking the one that will go on easily with a roller and brush, and look 
&gt; good on my Westy, which sits out in the sun all the time. And the Imron 
&gt; stuff looks like it isn't pre-mixed with all the proper additives. But....I 
&gt; CAN get it tinted to match my existing paint color. That is a big advantage.

Imron contains isocyanates. Those are some nasty chemicals, as they're odorless
and will cause permanent brain and nervous system damage. If you don't
have the proper safety equipment I strongly suggest you avoid using Imron,
even if you intend to brush it instead of spray. 

Not to mention that I can't imagine Imron looking anything but awful if not
sprayed and sprayed rather expertly. You can go to an automative paint store
and have them make up the colour of your choice in an enamel that they will
put in rattle cans for you. I'd do that before rolling/brushing.
