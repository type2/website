Subject: RE:locking gas cap

Since there are so many different types of locking gas caps, this will be 
fairly general, but here goes.  First of all, put your key back into the 
cylinder and see if the cylinder can then be re-inserted in the body of the 
cap.  If so, that might allow you to unlock it.  If not, look into the 
bottom of the housing.  There will probably be either a slot or a tab that 
normally engages with the lock cylinder.  Depending on the construction, you 
should be able to take a screwdriver, needlenose, etc. and move the lock bar 
that way.  If nothing else, using side cutters, pliers, etc. you can 
frequently peel the cap apart and take it off in pieces.  Needless to say, 
be careful if you decide to use a Dremmel or similar tool and avboid sparks 
at all costs.
