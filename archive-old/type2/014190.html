Subject: Re: [T2] what are all these knobs?

&gt; * The knob directly to the right of the steering column on the dash (also
&gt; looks like a light knob).

Switch for rear interior light.

&gt; * The last knob on the dash to the right is a green knob with a swirly
&gt; painted on it. This knob lights up. I imagine its a heater or something?
&gt;
rear window defroster.

&gt; Next; the battery light on my dash never lights up, but I can seem to get the
&gt; little sucker apart to check the bulb. Any thoughts?
&gt;
&gt; None of my check lights light up on my dash (the generator lights) or the
&gt; turn signal lights).

this may be a wiring problem. common power for the inst cluster. should
be a black wire I think going to the last fuse.

 I've checked all fuses, and all seem to be in working
&gt; order. If I need to pull the speedo unit out, how do I work it around the
&gt; vent knobs, and then what do I look for?

The knobs are held in by  nylon buttons on the shafts. Look at bentley. if
you get in there with a thin blade you can pop them out. then the knobs
and shafts slide out. they are still somewhat firm in there due to metal
clips that put pressure on them (dont lose these) .I dont replace the
buttons afterword because the knobs will stay in fine without them.
look for a black wire that jups to all of the lamps thadont light and
follow it down to the fuse panel.

good luck
