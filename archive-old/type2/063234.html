&gt;Just checked the stats (thanks Joel) and found 14 '80 Vanagons on the 
&gt;Type2 list and 12 on the Vanagon list (probably most are double 
&gt;dippers).  Just for yucks, what are your VIN numbers?
&gt;I checked the archives to find that we are in no-bus land,
&gt;not a *real* Vanagon VIN, and not properly coded to be a loaf VIN.
&gt;My VIN's are 25A0021024 and 25A0007484.
&gt;BTW according to the loaf VIN numbers there shouldn't be an
&gt;&quot;A&quot; where it is, but . . . if it's an '80, chart extrapolation from 
&gt;the Vanagon VIN says it should be.

Ahh, this question seems innocent enough, but I sense the makings of a
&quot;vintage&quot; vanagon subclass and maybe even a distant future list split ;-)!!
This is an historic post which should be preserved in the archives:  the
first recorded vintage-vanagon query.  The publication of the correct trim
part #s for the 79 1/2 vs 80 will soon follow...
