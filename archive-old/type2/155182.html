Subject: excuse me

Bus content: I hate to hit the whole list, but my old hard drive failed
on me with no warning, and I lost my contacts.  We're getting together
to solve my transmission problem, and I need Joe Stewart north of
Hotlanta to email me.  Thanks, and thanks to you all for the great
advice.

Couple other thoughts to share: you people rock.  Because of you I'm
shopping for a Bug, and your willingness to take things into your own
hands has inspired me to kick Windows for good.  This baby is Linux
powered, and although all I changed was the hard drive, it acts like a
different, faster computer.  If any of you hands-on heroes wants more
info, email me personally, dbradle_at_bellsouth_dot_net, and I'll happily help
you out.

Thanks again, folks,
David
