Hey, I know the answer to that one!!!  Whatcha got is a poor ground and
probably a missing ground strap between the body and the engine/trans.  (As I
remember it's at the nose of the trans.)  So, when you crank over the engine,
the starter (and its attendent 300+ amps) is grounding through that other fine
ground cable, err, clutch cable.  Be glad that it's not a Vanagon...  then it
would be grounding through the accelerator cable and it would MELT!
