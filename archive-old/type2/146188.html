Imagine a flexible tube with a lens and light in the end that allows you to see inside of a space like a cylinder or around corners. Cheaper varieties would not bend. As cheap as web-cams are getting, see if you can find one of those that would work. Heck, maybe I'd be inclined to tear a webcam apart and make something useful. 

Mechanics, Docs, and others use these scopes. 

I see a Mac tool variety on that auction site right now. Normally much more expensive from other suppliers (like Edmunds Scientific). Harbor Freight has one too. Also called Fiber Optic scope. Northern Tools also has one. Yeah, I'd be looking for the cheapest one I could find too since I'd expect to use it just a few times in 30 years. Of course if you owned one, maybe you'd FIND uses for it... Rusty rocker panel inspection, inside walls, etc.
