&gt; About 2800 miles after rebuild, it starts to cut out on me. Only after

&gt; of the nylon block that rubs on the cam shaft. IT seemed like a stretch to
&gt; me, but that's what he found. 

this has been known to happen.  a drop (pencil point size) of grease on 
the cam will help allieviate this.

&gt; Set points, starts right up runs fine, until
&gt; it cut out on me again.

standard checking procedure:

1) fuel
	a) a fuel pump that's going south can cause this type of behavior
	b) so can a fuel filter that's bouncing around on a line and 
		crimping your fuel line
	c) so can something blocking your fuel line in the tank

    testing:
	c) is there fuel in your carb bowls
	d) have you verified fuel pressure (a vac/fuel-pressure gauge 
		costs $20) -- should be ~5 psi
	e) turning the engine over with the fuel line off gives 
		qualitative data, but if the fuel pump isn't dead yet, it
		could be misleading

2) spark
	a) did you check the dwell with your volt meter and/or verify by 
		turning the engine over with the dizzy cap off that the 
		points were opening
	b) could be a bad condenser, when one starts to go it can cause
		some bizarre results

	c) juice: if your genny is working fine, this shouldn't be an 
		issue.


my guess: it's a fuel issue.  perhaps the fuel pump or the fuel pump 
acutator rod, but if you've got a fuel filter that isn't tied down, strap 
that puppy in so it doesn't bounce around and crimp your fuel line -- this 
is generally only a problem with the glass, reusable filters.
