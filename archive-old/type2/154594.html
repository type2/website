Subject: RE: [T2] what would grove the push rod

&quot;Thanks for the advise all but the grove is near the lifter side.  I  will 
pull the tube this morning and see if it is bent up at the end.&quot;

Perhaps the damage happened earlier when the pushrod tube was the other way
around and just got missed the last time it was assembled? Did you do the
original assembly? If you didn't do the original motor work, test fit the
pushrod and see if it lines up with the errant keeper wire. Just a
thought...
