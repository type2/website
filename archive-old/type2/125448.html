Subject: How Hot is too Hot for Oil Temperature

I was out driving my 1971 Westy after installing a new VDO gauge and managed
to achieve what felt to me like some pretty high temperatures.  Turning
about 4,000 rmp it got up to about 255 at one point.  Is this where bad
things start to happen?  When does oil break down?  What temperature is too
high for cylinder heads?  I read through the library and found oil
temperatures of 250 and cylinder head temperatures of 350f.  Is this
sustainable?

Thank you,
