Subject: Electric Heater  Q's

A coworker has offered me an electric heater for my '66.

Now, I know that an electric heater will not be able to warm up a whole
bus, but I'm going to put a partition behind the cockpit.

The heater is an electric 20 amp unit.  Can a stock alternator on a type I
engine drive a heater like this and still charge my batteries?  

I have a  voltmeter in my bus, what are the minimum allowable 
numbers I should see that would indicate sufficiently healthy operation?

Thanks!
