Subject: making a warmer bus

i just read the bob hoover sermon on insulating a bus (bought the cd ...neat 
stuff on it) was wondering if anyone had ever used the spray foam techniques 
he advises as part of insulating a bus...if so, does anyone have a brand 
theyd recommend? any advice before i try something like this? this stuff 
wont trap moisture and rot my roof will it? im thinking of refinishing my 
headliner...a tung oil finish should do nicely...and while i have the parts 
down, it seemed sensible to look into spraying insulation up there (no, i 
havent pulled my headliner yet, my bus is buried under snow- lots of it- at 
the moment :)
