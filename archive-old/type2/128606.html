&lt;&lt; So ... your gettin' lazy hey?  If you already did one whole side with

&quot;I wish I had done that job right.&quot;

If you're gonna use chemical stripper, then make absolutely positively
sure you've got it all out of the seams and whereever else it might 
hide...Even if you think you've neutralized the stuff, it has a bad ha-
bit of bubbling thru' the next coat of paint...
