Subject: Re: [T2] Electrical mystery

Folks,

Methinks it's about time for my yearly electrical rant....

However, the archives already have it!

http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/type2/139627.html

deedeebus,

BTDT and I might be afraid to start the bus as well.

Take some time, look at/stare at/absorb the diagrams and then match
diagram to reality.  Yes, it seems to be hard, but you *can* do it
as lots of people on the list have managed to eventualy work it out.

Do the wires match the diagram...got too many?...to few?  Do they go to 
the same places as the diagram says?  

Yes, fuses numbered left to right(drivers side to passenger side).

Good luck!, dave

&gt; I don't want to melt the wire harness again.
&gt; 
&gt; Whatever the problem is, could we be getting to the root cause of what
&gt; melted the wire in the first place?
&gt; 
&gt; I'll go try the fuses.  I have Ratwell's fusebox layout.  The numbers are
&gt; assigned to the fuses left to right, right?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks--
