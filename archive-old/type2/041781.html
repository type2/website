&gt;David,
&gt;So can an exhaust gas analyzer tell you what your fuel ratio is?  If so,
&gt;then I guess my question has been answered.  If not, do I need specific
&gt;percentages when I go in?

I guess I wasn't reading closely enough.  I'm not sure what the analyzers
can tell you - what you need is a wideband O2 sensor, which some
performance tuning shops will have.  The only easy way to tell what your
A/F ratio is under part or full throttle is on a chassis or engine dyno.
If you don't want to remove your engine from the bus, find a chassis dyno
with a wideband - that's what I did.

&gt;I want to know ahead of time what the engine runs best at *before* I go
&gt;to the shop(assuming the shop doesn't know about buses).  So you're
&gt;recommendation is 13.75:1?

No, I recommend no leaner than 13.0:1.  I see that I said &quot;richer&quot; instead
of &quot;leaner&quot; in my previous post... guess it's too late at night to be
thinking about this stuff, sorry.  :-)

&gt; Yes, if it's run hard.  I would not feel safe running an air-cooled engine
&gt; richer than 13-to-1.  13.5 or even 13.75 would be acceptable for most cars,
  ^^^^^^ Meant leaner here!
