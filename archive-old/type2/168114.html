Subject: Re: [T2] cold start problems SOLVED

The problem turned out to be the thermo-time switch.   The replacement did 
not last long (less than one year)    But jumping the two terminals   in the 
Thermo Time in   its connector resulted in an instant start.   
Still, I like the greater elegance and fool proof nature of providing the 
ground to the CSV via a wire to a   momentary switch on the dash.   As long as 
that wire does not contact a ground before the button, no problems. Even if an 
inadvertent ground happens, it should not affect the operation of the CSV, 
except when the starter is in operation. 

Now if I replace a section of the exhaust pipe from the crossover to the 
muffler, I should be good to go on a lengthy road trip right away
