&gt;       The condition of his van is as follows:
&gt;
&gt;       - No engine
&gt;       - 140,000 miles
&gt;       - Door in good working condition
&gt;       - Some rust starting to creep in the rear quarters
&gt;       - 4 speed transmmission
&gt;       - Sink, stove, ad refrigerator
&gt;       - Needs to be painted
&gt;       - Support beams in good shape
&gt;       - Needs tires
&gt;       

I would say you are looking at a $1000 bus, assuming the rust is minor. 
Anything substantially less would probably be a good deal; if it's much 
more than $1000, than I'd look it over a little more cautiously.  A late 
bus Westy in decent but not excellent condition, with a good motor, some 
rust, decent paint, etc. is worth maybe $2500-$3000, so figure out the cost 
of the engine, paint, etc. and the risk of the unkown (as you say, you 
can't drive it) and subtract from there.  Then subtract a little more, 
because you have to consider the cost/hassle/time of getting it fixed up. 
Most importantly, look for structural rust on the front axle beam and below 
the sliding door.  If there is any substantial rust around the axle beam, I 
would walk away.

By the way, I have a ton of parts from a '76 Westy and a '78 bus that I 
stripped over the summer.  If you do buy this bus, I may be able to help 
you with any parts you need, and UPS them to you from Philadelphia.
