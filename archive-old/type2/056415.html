Subject: Where is Jim Thompson?

Hi all!

I orderd a bunch of stickers from Jim about three months ago.  Since I
have called several times and only gotten voice mail, and have sent
several messages to him but so far I have not gotten any response from
him at all.

I know this is a little thing, but I sent him a check for $17 along with
my order which I know he got because the check was cashed three months
ago.  I did hear from him just after that, but it was to ask which color
of sticker I wanted, and to tell me that it would be a few days because
he was in the middle of restocking his sticker inventory.

All of that I can understand, and I understand that he has had some
technical difficulties, but I have tried to reach him often enough that
one would that that I would have caught him at least once.

I don't mind waiting, but I would at least like to know why it is I am
waiting.  Right now I have no idea.  

This is by no means an attempt to bad mouth anyone, I know Jim is very
reputable, and a decent man.  This is mearly an attempt to reach someone
using any means available.  I would hate for anyone to lose anything due
to a few undelivered stickers.

Thanks, and if Jim gets this, please get in touch with me so I at least
know why I'm waiting.
