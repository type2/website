Subject: gas tanks &amp; gas filler tubes
Mime-Version: 1.0

Sunday morning I went out to the barn to do &quot;a little body work&quot; on my 74
westy - right rear corner rust through.  Anyway, by last night the 1800 was
on the ground and I had swapped gas tanks from my wrecked 79 bus into the
74 westy.  Before I even turned the sander on I got the bright idea that my
gas guage needed to work in the camper.  I got the bulkhead panel loose
enough to do the bently procedure for testing the sending unit, and it was
bad.  I thought, &quot;forget the gas guage, I'll just keep track of my
mileage&quot;.  Well, I couldn't get the bulkhead back on, so frustrated, I
pulled the engine.

The inside of a 79 gas tank is different from the 74.  The fuel filler
tubes are different as well.  I am assuming FI and return gas are the main
reasons for the differences in the tanks.  I like the 79 filler pipe
better, because it was steel except for the cap/filler end boot, and a 6&quot;
tank connection boot.  The 74 had a much longer, maybe 18&quot;, section of
flexible tubing connecting the steel tube to the tank.

The 74 had copper vent lines in the gas tank compartment, and the 79 had
plastic.

I don't know if any of this stuff was original equipment, especially on the
74, but the 79 stuff looked untouched inside the gas tank compartment.

Maybe I'll get aroud to the body work after I install cooling flaps, the
little boot thing to cool the alternator, hoover's firewall gas line thing,
etc., etc., &amp; reinstall the motor.  One good thing, I convinced myself it
was OK to splurge &amp; buy a nice floor jack.  Bricks, boards, bottle jacks
and 2&quot; pieces of broom handle no more, now all I need is 2,000 s.f. of
concrete floor in the barn &amp; I'm set.  (know what the 2&quot; pieces of broom
handle are for?)
