Subject: Re: Juddering clutch in 1982 Bus

&gt;1982 Bus (Vanagon), 2.0l air-cooled, 4 speed, 125k miles:
&gt;When you bring up the clutch the whole vehicle shudders. This happens 1st
&gt;and reverse, but also in 2nd. In fact it is easier to reproduce it in 2nd.
&gt;When there are enough revs and take up is slow its OK but when you are
&gt;trying for a quick getaway in 1st or 2nd its more noticeable.
&gt;
&gt;How do you diagnose whether its a bad clutch or just what happens normally
&gt;because of the engine mountings?

Once I had excessive green synthetic grease goop in the pilot bearing, and
it &quot;spidered&quot; out and a little got on the clutch disc. It never made it
slip, but it made it judder throughout the life of that disc. It acted
exactly as described above. This was on an upright.
