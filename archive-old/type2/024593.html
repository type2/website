Hiya All,

Just went out to change my fuel lines.  Bought the Bus about eight months 
ago.  Inspected the fuel lines then.  They looked OK.  Fairly fresh and no 
tears or abrasions.  Clamps on all connections.  
The main reason I was changing out the fuel lines was so that I could install 
a safety pass-through fitting in the bulkhead wall.  So a few inches behind 
the bulkhead I clamped down a vise-grip to close the rubber line while I 
disconnected.  Inside of five seconds there was gas everywhere.  The rubber 
braided gas line had become so fragile at that particular point that it just 
fell apart when I clamped it.  Had I put off doing this little job there is 
an excellent, almost certain, chance my Bus would have been toasted in a fire.
I'd stress that the lines looked and felt fine.  The vise-grip was not 
adjusted too tightly.  It was just that line's time to go.  I know, I should 
have replaced those lines when I bought the Bus.  But I didn't.
So......do me a favor.  Go out and check, really check your fuel lines.  Do 
it now.  You could be doing yourself a favor too!

Mike
