I agree with that.

&gt;&gt; Duncan, my 72 has been really good, and I owned a string of 71's (and a few
&gt;&gt; earlier splitties) along the way . . . other than the aggravation of
&gt;&gt; workin' on it (no access thru upper deck - been thinking about getting
&gt;&gt; handy with a circular saw) what are the unique problems with the 72 ??
&gt;
&gt;First year for the Type IV engine, no over-engine access hatch (good
&gt;luck changing #1 and #3 plugs)...

Add smaller disc brakes (compared to 73-on) and one-year-only bumpers too.
Even if I were to admit that 72 was a &quot;bad year&quot; (which I won't, BTW) it
would still be better than the best year of the Dodge Caravan.

Possible good things about 72's:

Plentiful!  72 was the peak volume year imported into the US if I remember
correctly.  If you find a VW bus in the junkyard, it is likely to be a '72.
 Try it, you'll see.

Powerful type IV engine without the smog crap!  Easily upgradeable to 2
liters.

Shorter intake manifolds are less prone to icing on cold mornings! (seriously)

Oil bath air cleaner!

Classic early-model style bumpers and front turnsignals!

&lt;partially serious sarcasm&gt;
No annoying engine access hatch!  It's hard to get to, compromises the
integrity of the rear deck, and I never use it anyway!  Spark plugs are no
problem if you know where they are!  If you need to see the engine from the
top you can drop the drivetrain in 45 minutes!  I'm thinking about
insulating over mine without cutting out a hole for the hatch.
&lt;/partially serious sarcasm&gt;
