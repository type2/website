Subject: oil filter removal

Re difficult oil filter removal- if it has flats around edge, get the right
wrench to fit and use a socket wrench or flex handle.  If it has no flats,
then bang in two 12 penny nails into a piece of 2x4 (near the end; I drill
a hole for the nail near end), just far enough to equal staying inside the
diameter of filter.  Now the messy part- with a hammer, pierce the filter
with the nails up flush to board and TURN it loose!     MB
