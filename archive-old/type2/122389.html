&gt; 1) Clock Brown ground wire connected to ground spades in circle pattern on
&gt; back of speedo cluster

Or the one on the body behind the radio.

&gt; 2) Clock light wire (grey/red) jumperd to wire that connects rest of
&gt; instrument lighting. I did this by inserting
&gt;   a multi-spade connector on the back of original single spade on the
&gt; emergency flasher switch.
&gt;   This is where existing instrument lighting wiring terminates (originates
&gt; at light switch).
&gt;   Then on the new multi spade connector I put on the original wiring for
&gt; instrument cluster
&gt;   and the new wire to the clock light.

That works. I believe busses with clocks had a factory intrument light
wiring that covered all bulbs including the clock.
 
&gt; 3) Hooked up red power wire to top of fuse # 9 slot in the fuse box. My user
&gt; manual says
&gt;   this is for accessories, and it seemed to be empty on mine, with a couple
&gt; empty spade
&gt;   connectors. I attached the clock light wire to one of these empty ones.

Someone told me once that clock power came from B+ on the emergency flasher
switch but I've seen two at the junkyard that went to the fusebox just as
you did.
 
&gt; Q1) Does anyone know if fuse # 9 is hot all the time, or only when key is
&gt; turned on ? I do not
&gt; have my battery/wiring installed since I just got the Bus back from the
&gt; painters, so cannot
&gt; test it. If not, which fuse slot should I use ?

Hot all the time. #9 terminal on the large wire in the main harness that
goes to the battery.
 
&gt; Q2) # 9 fuse is a 16 amp fuse. Is this ok for the Clock, or do I need an 8 amp
&gt; to better
&gt;      protect the clock ? If so, any recommendation on which fuse slot I
&gt; should attach power to ?

I'd leave it as is.
