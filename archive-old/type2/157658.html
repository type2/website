Subject: Re: [T2] And now with less power!

 I did my first 100 mile break-in tune up on my '70's
 new, but bone-stock,
 1600 dp motor. It now runs smoother with less noise
 and the torque curve is
 more linear. However, It now has noticeably less
 power which is odd.
 
 Checked (but did not adjust) the timing at 28
 degrees total advance at 3000 rpm.
 
--------------------------------------------------

A couple questions come up here.....

1) a bone-stock 1600 engine in a 1970 bus is supposed
to be a single port. A 68-70 bus uses a 30 carb with a
vacuum advance ONLY distributor. What dist and carb
are you using??

2) and what are you baseing this 28 max degrees figure
on? A 009? Again, not bone-stock for any bug or bus......
