Subject: [T2] exhaust stud please help

I just ordered exhaust studs from rmmw for my 78 (vw doesn't even have
the correct ones, they sell an insert to bring down the diameter of the
head hole) rmmw is 10mm one side and 8mm on the other, one person on the
list told me it should be 9 and 8 but vw said 10 the rmmw sales person
couldn't confirm this as stock size.  can anyone confirm this?  i really
don't want used ones in this application and my old ones were bent ( i
was afraid straightening may result in failure of the stud.  I had
originally ordered some from busdepot but they were 8mm on both sides,
this is what vw also said they would give me but that i also needed
inserts to bring down the head diameter. i need some piece of mind as i
am anxious to get the exhaust system back on so my bus is driveable ...
i don't have long before the roads get salted and i need to put my baby
away for the winter
thanks
jamie
