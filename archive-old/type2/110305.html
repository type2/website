Subject: Re: [T2] Engines

Hi Noel,

The &quot;rumours&quot; about the reliability of GEX engines are well known to 
the members of this list, and have been proven in court.

Even if they installed them in a drive-through window it wouldn't be 
worth it.  Like...&quot;You want fries with that?&quot;

Don't go there.
