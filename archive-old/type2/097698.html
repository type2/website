Subject: Why won't it bleed?

74 Westfalia--my brakes used to be &quot;high and tight.&quot; The brake servo is 
bad, so I have to use a lot of oomph. But the brakes seem OK otherwise.

BUT I recently lost about 50% of the pedal. Now I have to push about 
halfway to the floor before I feel any action. The action is still very 
firm, not spongey. In spite of some evidence of leakage on the inside of 
the right rear tire, the brake fluid reservoir is nearly full.

It looks like I have plenty of lining left on the rear brake shoes. The 
front pads are just at the place where they need to be replaced.

I tried bleeding from the right rear wheel. NOTHING happened when I 
loosened the nipple and had my brakeman (Emma) stomp the pedal. I could 
see some weepage in the threads but no bleeding or leaking when the 
brakes were applied.

Is it possible that I have some kind of blockage in the rear brake 
circuit? If so, should I try bleeding from the front to back and see if 
that clears out gunk from the old fluid?
