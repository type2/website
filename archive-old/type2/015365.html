&gt;Hi list -
&gt;
&gt;I'm getting ready to put in my GEX rebuild. 

Do research the archives on GEX before you put another dime into it. You
have a very possible foundation for failure in that long block.

Just measure the crankshaft end play. It is probably excessive. Tell them
it is unacceptable as a spec motor, particularly with the non-spec RTV
everywhere. Get as much of your money back as you can and know in future
that loss-leader multi-color ad motors are junk. It costs twice as much to
have factory new specs in a proper motor of this type. And not a single
drop of RTV. 

If that cooler was in place when it's motor ran out of oil and went
ca-chunk, replace it. It can well have shardes of bearing matierial that
will lunch your new motor. If it is just got some varnish problems,
keroseen with a parts washing addative will so a good job with a few days
of soaking and flushing. Then blow it out with hot water, then blow dry.
Find the right kind of brush to scrub at the matrix outside and poke
through the air holes with wire. If in fact when cleaning you see anything
metalic come out, replace it. Your new bearings will love you for it.
