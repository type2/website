Hi Volks,

Last night, in preparation for the old GASS camp-out and show this weekend,
I tackled my mysterious new tick and my age-old idle problem. My tick, with
the help of the list responses (thank you-thank you- thank you) turned out
to be a loose turn signal switch. Took all of 5 minutes.

Now to the idle problem. Took off my new 34 pict3 carb to see why I was
having trouble turning the idle circuit adjustment. Turns out that there was
flashing around the O'ring at the end of the jet. Removed the flashing,
re-installed the carb and it idles like a baby.

So, bus runs great, and I'm off to the GASS show on Friday. Anyone else
going? It's really a great event.

This list is great. Many, many thanks to all who responded to my troubles. I
hope I can return the favors. TBear

Don't take life to seriously--You'll never live through it.
