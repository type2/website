Subject: Re: [T2] master cylinder rubber

Hiya Patrick,

Just went through the same thing with my 70 Bus when I redid the brake 
system.  Here's what I found out..............

The little rubber sleeves for the brake fluid feed tube are no longer 
available.  Inasmuch as the plastic brake fluid feed tube is molded to use 
these &quot;sleeves&quot; if you don't have the sleeves you have to find an alternative 
feed tube.  My sleeves were still there but in terrible shape.  Both were 
almost a lumpless shape of goo by the time I got them off.  So, I went the 
new tube route.

I went down to a local business, Oil Filter Service, here in Portland and 
described my predicament.  I also took my brake fluid reservoir to make sure 
the hose would fit.  Presto!  They had the just the beast I was looking for.  
About $3.00 a foot for a corrosive resistant hunk of tube.  What's more It 
fit snugly through the body grommet for the old hose after I &quot;hollowed out&quot; 
the grommet a touch.  Worked out very well for me.

I'd suggest you find a business in your area which specializes in ind
ustrial/high strength hose and fittings.  They should be able to do you up 
nicely.  If you need the name of the stuff, let me know and I'll go out get 
behind the kick panels and let you know.

Mike
