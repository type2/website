I seem to remember reading in the Archives a piece about how the cooling
flaps worked in tandem with the directional metal guides inside the fan
housing.  Think it was a Hoover sermon.  Anyways, the jist was that the
cooling flaps kept the air coming from inside the fan housing on track
to the hottest parts of the cylinder heads, thereby giving them the 
benefit of a steady(non turbulent) stream of air.  
On my rebuild I'm planning on keeping my flaps intact w/ thermostat attached.
