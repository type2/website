Greetings List -

Thanks to all for the comments on fixing my cracked water tank. It turns out
that the crack actually did propagate to the drain tube threads - bad news.
Here's how I fixed it.

I got a 4&quot; piece of copper pipe (threaded on both ends), slightly larger
diameter than the drain tube threads.

I pulled my butane &quot;pen torch&quot; out of the garage and heated the copper pipe
to, oh, very hot. Using gloves, I pushed, while rotating, the copper pipe
into the vacant drain tube threads. The pipe melted the
poly-whatchamacallit, and fused itself solidly into place. A standard PVC
cap plugs the drain pipe.

I trimmed about 1/4&quot; of material from the filler tube, and chopped it all up
into little bits. This material was used as a &quot;welding&quot; medium. I sprinkled
some of the bits around the base of the copper pipe and used the pen torch
to carefully melt the bits to get a good build up around the base of the
pipe. This worked. I also used the same method to weld up the cracks. The
copper pipe is SOLIDLY in place

The result is a water-tight water tank! Hey admins - this one belongs in the
fix-it section!!

Ta ta -
