Subject: Small parts needed plus climbing shoes!

Hey Y'all,
Anybody got an extra starter\engine mount bolt laying around (the one with the &quot;D&quot; shaped head)? How about a tranny ground strap? I'm pretty sure year doesn't matter, but if it helps, they are for the '66 Kombi. I can give you cash or trade, I have a few trinkets on the shelves in the garage. Speaking of trading (are you reading this Frank B?) Are there any rock climbers out there on the list. I have an almost new pair of climbing shoes, high ankle, lace up, &quot;Climb High&quot; brand that I would trade for some VW stuff. Pretty much any VW stuff. I forget the size (european size) but I think the U.S. equivalent is about a men's size 9.5, I bought them at a going out of business sale from a local gear shop, and I got the size wrong. And of &quot;No return&quot; on clearance items. They have been used less than 15 times and then my feet just started hurting too much! They retail for about $100 beans, but I'd take MUCH less than that in trade merchandise! Let me know..
Your Pal, Horse-Tradin' Johnny B.
