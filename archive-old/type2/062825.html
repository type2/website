&gt; Hey all,
&gt; 
&gt; After reading and viewing various pieces regarding those cool brazilian busses, my obvious
&gt; question is &quot;HOW COULD I GET ONE?&quot;  I've read about how it's impossible to get 1996 beetles
&gt; into the states but, I am a CANADIAN, we don't care about all that smog stuff ;)  SO, anyone, is
&gt; this possible? Where would find out about the rules about importing? How much are they?
&gt; etc.etc.  I know I'm probably dreaming cuz I'm sure I can't afford one, but it's Friday after all so
&gt; I'm allowed :) Just curious more than anything, Comments??
&gt; 
&gt; Happy Friday (the first time I'm working one all summer! )

I've written to Brazilian importers of Beetles, and I din't think the 
bus is being produced any more. Beetles can be imported and made &quot;legal&quot; 
by pulling the ID from an old bug.
