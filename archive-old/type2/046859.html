Replying to William.Warburton_at_let-it-be-thus_dot_com re Danskpart Heat
Exchangers.

As promised, the details of Dansk Autopart A/S are as follows:-

Dansk Autopart A/S (otherwise known as J.P. Group, Jopex Division)
Hjulmagervej 5
DK-8800 Viborg
Denmark

Tel. +45 86 62 61 61
Fax. +45 86 61 22 30

e-mail: info_at_jpgroup.dk

Managing Director: Martin Pedersen
Production Manager: Stefan Justesen

These details were given to me by the Royal Danish Embassy in London; 
extracted from the Kompass On Disc Trade Directory, last updated 1st July 
2000.

If you are supplied with ill-fitting or otherwise faulty heat exchangers or 
other exhaust system components, complain to the suppliers and obtain 
replacement parts. Grumbling amongst ourselves, on the VW Type 2 list or any 
other forum, achieves nothing! Do not bodge the installation; you will only 
live to regret it.

For more than 4 years, I have been trying to elicit information from other 
VW Type 2 owners, about the nature and extent of problems with exhaust heat 
exchangers, from Dansk Autopart and other manufactures. It is my intention, 
to present this damning evidence to them, in order to try to pursuade them, 
to do something about these faults, so please send me as much information as 
possible.

In the meantime, do complain personally to the suppliers and do complain to 
the manufacturers. Some suppliers may simply resell returned faulty goods to 
the next unwary, uncomplaining customer, so the manufacturer might not be 
receiving the returned faulty goods!?

Another manufacturer of VW exhaust heat exchangers, is:-

Arvin replacement products Ltd. (otherwise known as TIMAX Exhaust Systems &amp; 
Catalysts),
Squires Gate Industrial Estate,
Squires Gate Lane,
Blackpool,
Lancashire,
FY4 3RN,
Great Britain.
