Message-ID: &lt;374ac901oil plate stud*_at_m400gw.wiley_dot_com&gt;

&gt;My question... how should I install the stud bolt?  
&gt;Just thread it in and put  on the nut?

pretty much. Good thing is wasn't the one stud that bolts to the sump on the 
inside. I had one of those strip once
and you have to split the case to replace that one.
 
&gt;Or, somehow (Locktite, JB Weld) coat
&gt;the stud and let it harden  into the sump before putting on the nut? 

I don't know. I suppose you could do that and have all the studs locked in 
there, usually half come off when you 
change the oil and half don't. You might try installing it dry with a new 
copper crush gasket, and if it still leaks reinstall
coating the threads with permatex.

&gt; And, any ideas as to why it came  out in the first place?

It worked it's way loose. Those 6mm studs strip easy and so one shouldn't 
overtighten them. Engines live and 
die this way all the time. See the Idiot book for
&quot;Stick's personal torque meter&quot; Basically, Stick tightens those nuts until he 
see's a tendon move slightly in his wrist.
Try it, it works.
