Subject: Mexican case? or whole engine?

The other day at the wreckers I found an engine case with the 
words 'Hencho en Mexico' embossed on the rear of the case right
underneath the distributor.  Unfortunately it was to dark to
check the markings at the normal oil sump area.
I was wondering if this meant that the case was made in Mexico or
the whole engine was.  
The case was a goldish color and looked to be in great shape.  
I'm thinking about picking it up but was asking for help in 
identifying it.  

Thanks
Derek
