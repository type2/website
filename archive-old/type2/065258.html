Subject: Mississippi Parts car run

I got the 80' Vanagon this weekend from Jackson Mississippi. Made
the trip in a 72' International Travelall with 300,000 miles on the
original motor pulling a dolly. Made 1150 miles in 28.5 hours, four
states, a great visit with Joel Walker in Alabama, and only pulled
over one time, (cop said he saw sparks shooting out from under the
van, at first I thought our rig holding the transmission had fell
but it was only the speedo cable) 
The Van had been parked under a
pecan tree on a farm for a few years and had all sorts of neat
things growing on it and living in it. However it does have its good
points:
 Dealer installed AC
 Dealer installed cruise control
interior was stored in a barn and is in good shape including the rubber backed
mats that go under the carpet in front and back (corduroy upolstry on 
seats)
 5 Michelins with lots of tread (one has a bulge and dry rot)
 Motor already apart but heads shot (all parts
still there)
 Trailer hitch that bolts to bumper and the tow hooks
Trim, lenses, glass and in good shape but the body is getting rough
All the life has been washed off the paint and glass and the mice and 
critters seem gone and the Van looks restorable but the cancer is 
terminal, at least part of  it will be going to a good place though,
It looks like I'll get the 81' Westy back to stock and have lots of
spare parts if anybody needs anything. The guy I bought it from also
let us go through and take any other type II and bug parts he had
lying around so I got lots of tin, heat exchangers and a spare
generator for the 70'. The guy also was into the little Honda
cars with cycle engines and he gave my buddy a ton of parts, even 
some new ones.. All in all a great trip but the only other VW's we 
saw were Joel's doublecab and highly accesorized Vanagon (both very 
impressive)
