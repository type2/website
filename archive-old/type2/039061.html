Subject: Which carb?

Dear list,

This Bank Holiday weekend I packed the girlfriend and the dogs into
Molly, our '73 Westy, and we trundled off to the nearby Dalby Forest
National Park for an excellent weekend.  Our homemeade blackout curtains
worked a treat and my newly replaced windows didn't leak a drop --
fortonately it rained only at night, after we'd returned from the pub. 
If anyone's interested, the site we stayed at charges just 4GBP per
night to park a camper, and though the facilities are minimal it's only
half an hour from an excellent pub meal.

On to the question.  My DAd's had great success with his rebuilt 2l
engine and the Weber dual progressive carb.  He forked out an astounding
270GBP for the carb and the manifold but he's getting great reliability
and good gas mileage.

I'm loathe to spend that much money on a camper that cost me only 800GBP
in the first place.  A friend recently pointed out to me that the 2l
Ford Cortina engine came with a Weber dual progressive as stock, and I
could pick up a decent carb for very little money from a scrap dealer.

1) could someone confirm for me that the Weber 32/36 progressive is
suitable, if not the exact one that's often used on type IV engines?

2) does anyone know where I can get a suitable manifold, now that Just
Kampers have decided to stop selling them?  I'm in the UK, so a UK
source would be good.  But if it can be done cheaper (ISTR that the
manifold cost was almost half the total cost my Dad paid) by importing
from the states I'm happy with that.

Cheers,

Chris.
