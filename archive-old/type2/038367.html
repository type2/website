Scott: (and all other listers)

My sincerest apology for the year typo on my 1st message.  My Bus is a 1976 
and not a '73.

I acquired the vehicle in January this year from a good friend.  It is 
definitely NOISY.  I'll fashion a piece of scrap and plug the tube shut.

Thanks,

Walt Fogle

&gt;Hello Type 2 listers:
&gt;
&gt;I've just purchased a new muffler for my '76 Campmobile.
&gt;Best regards,
&gt;Walt Fogle

&gt;
&gt;O.K. Is this for your 73, or 76? This little conector would be for the EGR
&gt;tube. I think in 74 it moved to the #3 exhaust port, but all it does is
&gt;route exhaust gasses into the intake to lower NOX. I would just plug/weld 
&gt;it
&gt;shut. It will not hurt anything(your EGR is not hooked up anyway). If not
&gt;pluged it could make lot'O noise.
