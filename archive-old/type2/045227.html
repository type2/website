Subject: [T2] Earthquake in Napa Valley

Not bus related at all, but I hope that everyone located near Napa Valley,
CA is ok.  I heard today a 5.2, multishock earthquake hit the area about 2am
PST.

Now on topic, I read a pretty good article in the October issue of DB&amp;HVWs
in the Transporter Talk area on bus (really, any project) reassembly.  The
author gave a general outline of what order to reassemble things in.  I
thought it was a pretty good article.  Apparently it's one article in a
series on bus restoration, but I suspect it could apply to any car
restoration project.
