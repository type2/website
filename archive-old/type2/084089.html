Subject: Re: [T2] Oil leak

Could be oil cooler seals, Oil filter mount flange, pressure sender, maybe
even the oil pump. Clean the area thoroughly then while still damp blor baby
powder liberaly on any suspected areas. Let it dry compleatly. Start the
engine and wait for the first drop of oil to apear. Shut down the engine. You
should easly be able to trace where the oil came from by the oil track in the
baby powder. Make sure you wash off the baby powder before opening anything up
for leak repair. Much cheaper than leak trace chemicals or guessing what's
leaking and repairing the wrong thing and has no effect on internal engine
components. I think oil cooler seals can be replaced without removing the
engine. ask the list I'm sure someone has tried it before.
Hope this 1970s tip helps. This is what we used to use before all the
newfangled tracer chemicals were invented.
