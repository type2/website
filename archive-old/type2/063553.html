Many European cars have heated seats, but here is one:

My Audi has great heated seats. The front seat has heating elements in
both the seating part AND the upright back area. Since Audi's are not
always appreciated in the US market, you can get great deals on
Audi parts at junkyards, presume it would be also true for the seats...

I'm also waiting to hear from Sammi D. on this thread, he has installed
heated Volvo seats in his breadloaf.
