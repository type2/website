&gt; Intermittent red light on
&gt; On the way home from High Country Bus fest, My generator light came on
&gt; brightly. Fan belt fine. Started up, three miles down the road, back on.
&gt; Stayed off after restart, but I was only 2 miles from home. Any ideas?
&gt; Voltage regulator?All connections look fine, and was a very bright light.

Check your brushes.  The end of the brush should not be inside the metal
brush holder.  Check both top and bottom brushes (that was my mistake!)

Could also be the voltage regulator.  Get and carry a spare, just in case.
