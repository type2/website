Subject: Engine oil.

Hi Bob,

Jake at aircooled has said much the same thing.  But I am certain that
the oil is coming from the joint of the plastic oil fill tube and the
metal elbow.  Oil is coming up right at the joint, and being sucked into
the fan and off it goes!!  There is no oil coming from the dipstick.
There may be some oil weeping out from the valve covers, but it is very
minute.

Question though.  If the bus has fewer than 75,000 mi, would the rings
be worn?  That is the miles on my 82.

All in all, I am seriously thinking about a complete engine rebuild.  I
can't see anyway out of it.

Thanks,
Eric.
