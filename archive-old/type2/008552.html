I called KYMCO per the advice of Don Boneau and the unit sounds nice like
Don said. A sandwhich adaptor is used between the oil filter and mount so
the stock oil cooler is kept. Mounting for the Vangon was suggested as
over the Tranny - sounds unconventional but it should be well protected
up there.  An electric fan is avaiable which can be controlled by a
switch on the dash or a thermostat.  

Only negative is that the sandwhich adaptor doesn't have a thermostat so
oil goes to the cooler all the time.  I asked about cool wheather, which
I had to expalin to my Cailf salesman as 30 deg or so.  He thought that
that might be a little cold and that warming the engine up fully first
might be prudent. We discussed disconnecting it for the  winter, blocking
it with a cover, etc.  While I don't plan to use my Van in the winter
thanks to all the road salt, I will probably see 20 deg mornings in fall.
Also on the planned Wyoming trip, I probably see  25 or 30 deg mornings &amp;
nites (days too?) and I can't really be disconnecting the cooler during
the trip.  Anybody got any experience with this one and the previously
mention location? 

P.S. saw an ad using an oil cooler mounted inside the van as a heater.
You move it outside the van in the winter.  If I described this to people
in &quot;normal&quot; cars they would not believe it.

Thanks to all on the list! - John Renyolds
