 Various people have written something to the effect of:

&lt;&lt; I am looking for someone nice enough to sell me a copy of 
their parts  manual. &gt;&gt;

I don't wish to beat a dead horse or raise the ghost of threads
past but...... I wouldn't make it known that I was copying these
manuals and selling them even if it was to just cover expenses.
By doing so you are in direct violation of U.S. copyright laws
and risk the wrath of whomever's book you copied.   Just because
something is out of print doesn't mean its OK to copy and 
distribute.   Now, my understanding of this law states that it is
OK to make copies for my own personal use.  I don't think that
it places a limit on the number of copies that I can make.......;)

Hey, I could be wrong here!  As someone else pointed out one
time to me I just do transaxles.
