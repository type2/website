Subject: front sitting up high

I know there's been many discussions about the rear sagging low but I've got the exact opposite.  Couldn't find anything in the archives or library.
The front is so high that the upper snubbers are pushed up into the upper arms.  The center of the sway bar is ABOVE the zerk nipple on the swing lever shaft.
It's all just as if I was jacking up the front frame.
When we jump into the front, it does not settle down.  I can't bounce it up and down softly.  I removed the shocks so that is not the problem.  I ran some lube through the arms and it squirted through ok, however, one zerk is broken off.  
WHAT exactly is pushing the front end up?
 
Thanks,  Chris- 72 Bus
