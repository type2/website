Subject: loss of power.....

ok i am not sure what has happened... everything was good yesterday and even last night////.....
only thing i did was tightened up the fan belt a little...
could i of possibly knocked it out of TDC or its set timing mark..?
i thought maybe it was the alternator but after changeing that and cranking back up and back up the drive way i realized nothing had changed...?
this is a newly rebuilt engine i might add which could or couldnt mean a thing...?
just need a second on the opinion of if i accidentally turned the alternator nut while tighting down the fan belt could of caused this type of power loss????????
she still sounds good but when you take her out you can really tell that she just isnt going... she isnt putting and jerky but yet smooth and very very slow,.. very slow....?
i am looking at the books now and trying to make heads or tails of this.... it has been quiet sometime since i set timing...
i have a light (standard strob)
and when i hooked it up the beam didnt really stay in a line ... bouncey?
didnt say i was good at this just said it had been awhile since i set timing ... LOL..
peace
Chris
