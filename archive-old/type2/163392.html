Subject: Re: [T2] VW Splitty &quot;big&quot; model toy

Note - The Purple Bus with the &quot;AudioBahn&quot; Graphics online is still showing
at $41.99.  These were very hard to find in the stores, mostly online:
http://www.target_dot_com/gp/detail.html/ref=br_1_11/601-5544776-3578526?ie=UTF8&amp;frombrowse=1&amp;asin=B000HK1PG6
(May have to cut &amp; paste URL)

The Blue Bus that had no &quot;AudioBahn&quot; Graphics were more common in the
stores.  But I couldn't find them online at Target this evening, nor could I
find the Bug(s) either.  But then I didn't do a massive search on their
site.  Collectors have probably bought 'em up to re-sell on EBarf.

&gt; Get 'em while ya can.  Looks like Maisto has discontinued 'em and Target
&gt; (at the stores I checked this week/weekend) are now OUT for good.
&gt;
&gt; I checked w/Maisto last week about getting some for Airhead Parts' toy
&gt; selection, but they said Target took most of 'em all and they weren't sure
&gt; they'd have any more in the forseeable future.  I picked up a couple
&gt; online to donate to the raffle at BBB XI :-)
