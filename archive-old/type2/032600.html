Subject: Dashboard question

My '78 westfalia has a factory hole centered under the glovebox.  There is a 
small collar around it and what appears to be a spring(?) inside.  One black 
wire comes out of the back of it and goes up the passenger side winshield 
pillar.
I can find no references to it anywhere in the owner's manual or Campmanuals, 
or Bentley either.
It sure appears to be factory installed.  My thinking is that it is possibly 
a light that is missing both bulb and cover(?)  But a light for what?  My bus 
has a gas heater but this in no way appears related to that.  I thought 
possibly a light to indicate whether the pop top is down and latched, but I 
can't find anything else to help that theory, so I guess I was wrong about 
that.  
Anyone else have a deal like this in their bus?  Whatever it is I'd like to 
get it working again.
Thanks
