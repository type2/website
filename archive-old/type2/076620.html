Subject: Re: [T2] How hot is HOT?

The stock FI boss on the 2.0 heads is NOT the place for the sensor. I have
DYNO tested the results on the same engine, same gauge with exact
atmospheric conditions.

The difference was near 50 degrees, and the time it took for responses to
the gauge was almost 3 times slower than with the sensor attached to the
spark plug, where it should be.

&gt; When you overheat too far then the pressed in valve seats begin to come
&gt; loose and you 'drop a valve seat'.
&gt;
&gt; You are running way hot in my opinion. I have never run more that 375
&gt; degrees under ANY condition --- and that includes towing a Hyundai Excel
&gt; from Norfolk to Chattanooga with a Beetle (Type IV powered).
&gt;
&gt; I would pull the VDO sender out and dip it into a pot of boiling water
&gt; (don't touch the sides of the container) and see what temp it reports ---
&gt; 212? Then it is right one and your engine is in fact running hot.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;New VW bus owner here... Just put in a VDO cylinder temperature sensor
and
&gt; &gt;it works great.  I just can't find any information on &quot;How hot is HOT?&quot;
I
&gt; &gt;did see an advertisement for another cylinder head sensor that shuts off
the
&gt; &gt;engine when it reaches 425F.  I've gotten it up to 450F and everything
seems
&gt; &gt;fine.  This particular sensor goes all the way up to 600F with no red
zone.
&gt;
&gt; The gauge is a generic one that is used for many applications so they
can't
&gt; specify a red zone because what is too hot for one application may not be
&gt; too hot for another.
&gt;
