Subject: Re: [T2] Rebuilt 2.0 FI - worst case scenario

One of the reasons I suspect the cam being out is the procedure Karl 
wrote (a week ago) to find #1 TDC:

&quot;If you can find your timing mark.... easy way to do it:
Remove 3/4 valve cover. Rotate the engine in the direction of rotation 
and watch the #3 cylinder valves. The exhaust will open and then close. 
Immediately after the exhaust closes the intake will open. If the intake 
does not immediately open, you are going the wrong way! Rotate the 
engine and watch the valves. JUST as the exhaust closes and JUST as the 
intake starts to move, STOP. Look at your crank pully. You should have 
the mark on zero [within a degree or 2]. This is the point of rocking 
and the opposite cylinder in the firing order will be at TDC to fire. In 
this case, #1.&quot;

When I do this the 'rocking point' on #3 is about 16 degrees before TDC 
on #1, which is NOT &quot;within a degree or 2&quot;.  With the webcam I know the 
lift is much greater than stock but I doubt it would affect the timing 
(at least that much).  Thus my suspicion of the cam being over a tooth.

How many teeth are in a cam gear?  Anyone know offhand? Then I could see 
if the degrees per tooth correlates to the ~16 degrees above. My only 
cam gear is buried in the engine...

Thanks to all so far.

&gt; I was wondering about this when reading you post as well. Your cam
&gt; specs should have a max lift right? If you can find at what degree of
&gt; the cam that point occurs at (i.e. specs or cam supplier) you should
&gt; be able to measure it with a dial indicator on the valve adjuster on
&gt; one of the cyls correct? the rest could just be math. I'd get out some
&gt; graph paper and start sketching.
