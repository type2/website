Subject: Double post: Bus nose question

Went home for lunch today to discover that my bus nose had come from Bus
Depot (Thanks Guys!). It's was drop shipped from RMMW (Bus Depot give about
a $30 price break over RMMW on the nose) and came on an 18 wheeler (too big
for UPS); that greatly impressed my littlest one. One note: Ron had
initially mentioned he was working on a deal with Dansk (Denmark) for the
noses; this one was IGP from Brazil. Good quality though.

Now my question: the nose is painted black. Is this a black primer, or do
need to primer over it?
