Subject: [T2] heated seats

A snip from another list on heated seats ---

(snip)


Saab automotive has done a lot of research on heated seats. They
have a &quot;white paper&quot; describing this work which you can get from a Saab
dealer. They have a lot of cold seats in Sweden. The white paper is so
serious in describing their experimentation that the whole thing becomes
inadvertantly quite humorous.

 &gt; &gt;  I wonder why we haven't touched on seat covers that are electrically
 &gt; &gt;  warmed like some of the high end imports have?
 &gt;
 &gt; I you have already got cold on the way to your car, you need a very hot
 &gt; interior to feel comfortable. On the other hand, heated seats give an 
instant
 &gt; feeling of warmth with a lot less energy consumption.
 &gt;
 &gt;  I've driven long distances in unheated cars and assuming a reasonably well
 &gt; sealed interior, the biggest heat loss is radiated heat from exposed 
skin. A
 &gt; small infrared heat source could be used to balance this loss.
 &gt;
 &gt; Another idea would be to cut air channels into the seat foam and blow warm
 &gt; air through the seat fabric. This would have the added benefit of using 
cold
 &gt; air during hot weather.
