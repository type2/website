Subject: Re: Jalousie window rattle

&gt;Hello all. Does anyone out there have a fix for rattles in the jalousie
&gt;windows? Mine make quite a bit of racket when traveling. I was thinking about
&gt;sealing the individual window segments with weatherstripping tape,
&gt;jim


If you are sure that the knob is screwed CLOSED as tight as it can go, then
your problem is likely to be in the 'rivets' that hold the glass frames to
the main, outer frame (not sure of the technical terms). Travelling with
the windows open will wear down the rivets and enlarge the holes they go
in, resulting in a rattle. The only true solution is replacing the window,
or drilling out the old rivets and installing new ones. Mine has a small
problem rattling on the pass side (one that is often open on the highway),
and I need to replace two of the rearmost rivets; window on the driver's
side is never open at speed, and is tight as a drum........
