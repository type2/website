Subject: Re: [T2] Awsome jack perfect for installing and uninstalling vw
  engines

Harbor Freight carries two transmission jacks that I've had my eye on. I 
can't vouch for the the robustness of the construction on either.

The 450 lb. jack is a scissors-type lift similar to the motorcycle lift 
but with four casters.

The 1 Ton jack is a standard rolling-type jack fitted with a 
transmission platform and safety chain. The tilt of the platform can be 
adjusted. The jack is made of pressed steel construction.

If anyone has had experience with either of these jacks perhaps they 
could share. The construction on some of the lower end pressed steel 
jacks is &quot;ify.&quot;

ALSO--in an earlier post someone asked about spot weld cutters. Harbor 
is expecting a shipment of spot weld cutters in the coming month or so. 
The design is either a square or a hex shank with center guidepoint and 
saw bit similar to a hole-saw. The carbide cutting teeth are reversible 
so you get twice the life from each cutter. Extra cutters and 
guidepoints are included. Most common spot weld sizes.

 &gt;Hello List,
 &gt;
 &gt; I found a jack the other day that almost looks like
 &gt;it was designed and made to install and uninstall vw
 &gt;engines. I am sure that some of you have seen it. It
 &gt;is sold at your local Sams Club. --Phil Houtz
