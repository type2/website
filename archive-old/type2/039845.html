Subject: Thank you!

Ok, what it looks like is happening here is:

a) I'm an electrical neophyte who can't measure anything more
complicated than volts, so
b) Muir's got me panicking over a little spark, and
c) a little spark is NORMAL since I have an in-dash clock and also one
in my radio.

The demise of my batteries is coincidental: the main battery was of
unknown history and has been replaced, and the auxiliary needed water in
5 of its 6 cells and it's dated 9/93, so its days are no doubt numbered.

Tonight I will reattach my ground strap and get a baseline voltage.
Tomorrow, I will recheck my voltage and record it. I will check spark at
my coil and double-check that the connections are on the proper
terminals.

Tuesday I will re-check my battery voltage. If it has dropped
significantly, I will then re-panic about having a short somewhere in my
system. 

Until then, I really need to calm down. I'm feeling very stupid and that
makes me very unhappy.

Thanks for all the input! I *will* review it and hopefully advance my
rudimentary electrical skills somewhat.

I'm reminded of the bumpersticker at Everybus: &quot;Not another learning
experience!&quot;
