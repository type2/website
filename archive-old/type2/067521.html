Re Phil Burton's 76 engine for sale- YOU GUYS ARE GETTING SLOPPY AGAIN-

PLEASE POST STATE/REGION WHERE SALE IS TO MAKE IT EASIER ON THE
INTERNATIONAL NATURE OF THE REST OF THE LIST!!!!!!!!

Now with that off my chest, may I ask for more info- like how many miles on
engine, any known maintenance history,  and will it rotate manually now
(not siezed?) with no clunking noises?  Try a crescent wrench on the
alternator nut and rotate clockwise.  If no go, then rotate the flywheel
(remove clutch plate and bolt on a bar across two holes for a little
leverage).  If no go, squirt Marvel Mystery Oil into spark plug holes (good
test to see if spark plugs even come out) and try again later- rings may be
rusted to cylinder? Also, WHERE THE #%$^ IS IT?
