&gt;A friend of mine has a 54 Deluxe that is very complete and has been in a

Well, I know one guy who bought a somewhat decent '55 deluxe, but needing
some bodywork and interior, for $9500.  

I know another fool who bought a really, really, REALLY, rusty '54 deluxe
for $7000.  I also know of someone who just sold a really nice '53 deluxe
for $25k.

The most important question here is: does he know what he has?  Is he even
remotely aware of its value?  What area in the country are ya?  Ya might get
away with $2000-$2500 or so, if he hasn't been exposed to the hype.  There
was a time when you couldn't _give_ barndoors away...

it is all relative.   does he have an idea what he wants?    how much do you
have available to spend on it?    how good a friend is he?   don't forget,
it'll cost a bit to fix it up.  
   a guy i met was *given*  a very nice flat sided gated 53 single cab last
year.  been sitting in a farmers field in Alberta (dry) for years.   (the
truck, not the guy)

Oh, and when you say &quot;complete&quot; - does it have the vent trim?  Correct
middle seat with 6, not 4, legs?  Radio (swoon!)?
- - - -
how about - correct bumpers with trim, panel that clips on to middle seat,
  keys,  wiring original? semaphores? steering in good shape?  horn button?
 floor mats? 

sounds great- hope you get it, and i bet thom is drooling.    :),
