Don't worry about the hose Adam.  I just keeps the gasoline smell out of
your engine room.  It sucks it through a charcoal filter and back into your
motor.  Would not cause your motor to not start.  I would, however, check
your generator.

Subject: Hose running to the Air cleaner?? Need Advice!!


Hello Everyone..I am a bit confused...today I was driving my newly bought 71

Westy out around town..made a few stops..it was driving great..just 
purrring...then of course I stop at the local AutoZone to pick up a few 
things--come back out and my engine will not turn over...so I had to get a 
jump from someone..and figured I would go back later to get a new 
battery...But here is where it get a little hairy...I was snooping around my

engine..trying figure out how to get the battery out..and I noticed a 
hose(Does'nt look like a typical rubber hose..but it has that sort of fabric

outside to it) was connected to one end and seemed to have slipped off the 
other end..If you visualize the where the dipstick is...there is a metal
line 
that comes straight up from there..attaches to this hose I have just 
described and then It looks like it runs to the air filter...Could that have

been my problem with it not starting?? Hope it didn't screw up my 
engine...but I guess what I am asking is: That hose is meant to connect to 
the air Filter? If someone could help me out I would appreciate 
it..Thanks..Adam
