Subject: Rear-end groaning under accelleration...confused

So, I read the archives and the library, but no definitive help on my 
particular situation.

When I accellerate, approaching 35mph, I hear a medium-loud 
droning/throbing sound coming from the rear of my bus.  It gets louder 
as my speed increases....I think it's the passenger side, but I'm not 
dead-certain.  When I coast in neutral, the sound is gone (largely).

First thing I found was a very old out-of-round tire...replaced it (both 
rears actually), and the sound didn't get a lot better.

Next I read what I could find in the archive, which lead me to believe 
it was a worn CV joint...seemed plausible, so replaced the entire axle 
assembly on the passenger side...not much better.  My plan for tonight 
is to replace the other one (because I believe in  doing things like 
this in pairs, and because I already have the part), and see what happens.

I did see in the archive that I should check the axle nut, and I'll do 
that tonight as well...not a lot of confidence that will be the fix either.

At this point I'm fully expecting the noise to still be there after the 
other CV axle is installed.  Any thoughts on what this might be, and how 
I might fix it?  I have the feeling that this is a pretty entry-level 
question, however I'm striking out for an answer so far.

Thanks in advance,

Jonathan
