Many thanks to all those who knew where the table went.  The latches were
not obvious due to an aftermarket A/C unit (non-functional) which I have not
removed yet.  The better half is in CA helping a friend this week, but I
will remove the A/C when she gets back this weekend.  I have many, many more
questions which I will post as I have time to address them.

&gt;The small table hooks to the dash under the radio.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;   Also, the camper had a small table in it, with a center post and two
&gt;&gt; &quot;catches&quot; on one side.  What does it hook to or where does it hook?  It
also
&gt;&gt; had two pipe clamps on the left side
&gt;&gt; of the sink/stove console, for a swing arm and another table.  I found a
&gt;&gt; replacement swing-arm and a large table in a VW shopping center in
Hesperia
&gt;&gt; CA.
