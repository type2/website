Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Wanted to let let you know...

I'd also like to add my accolades to Miss Smythe. I've seen her work and
have had her stay at my home along with her son and Husband. I also agree
that she's a class act. I'm sorry that you had a long wait for your canvas,
and hope that it lives up to your expectations.
Respectfully,
Britt Grannis
