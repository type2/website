&lt;&lt; One tube of the CV joint grease sold by, among others, RMMW is said to fill
 one joint and so it does if all one does is pack it into the joint itself.
 On the other hand, a mechanic at a VW dealer once told me  that the reason
 why my boots cracked that time was that &quot;the rubber dried up because I
 failed to push grease all the way in to fill the boot&quot;.
 
 Fast forward a decade to early this year.  I did this on new boots that I
 installed a thousand miles ago but three of the four are already cracked,
 a problem that many on this list have experienced. &gt;&gt;

i have a comment and a further question on this.  i too had the same problem. 
 i was told by a long time vw mechanic to only pack the joint itself.  the 
reasoning he gave me was that if you pack the boot itself with grease...you 
will cause the boot to split because of the weight and centifugal force 
applied to the boot as all of that grease is being spun around at 3-4000 rpm 
or so.  makes sense i thought so i did as he suggested....voila~ no more 
ripped boots.   but.....a problem has developed.  one joint ( the outer on 
the passenger side keeps ripping.  it rips on the part where the boot is 
around the axle shaft NOT near the part that bolts to the wheel assembly.  
all other boots show ZERO rips or tears of any kind.  i have replaced this 
problem boot every 5000 miles or less.  whats up am i missing something???????
