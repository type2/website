Subject: Rear Wheel Not Turning

I'm rebuilding the rear brakes of my 71 T2. I turn the adjuster nuts
so the brand new shoes are farthest away from the brand new drum (the
screws that move the shoes outwards are retracted in as far as they
will go.) I put the drum on, check the wheel for easy turning--fine.
Then I hand-tighten the two nuts that hold on the drum. Now the wheel
is not turning as well. The shoes are making partial contact with the
drum.

Anyone have brake shoe adjustment advice here?
