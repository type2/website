Subject: lame questions

Hi All,

Hope you don't mind a few lame questions...

1. What's a &quot;dizzy?&quot;

2. Distributor question: pull the wires and loosen the adjuster
bolt and the distributor comes out. Is there any way I can install
it (after new points, condenser) wrong? In other words, can it 
go back in only one way? 1971 Westy

3. In my rear view mirror, I noticed I get a puff of blue smoke
at each shift when going through the gears. Nothing visible on down
shifting. Rings?
It does consume oil, about 1 quart every 600 miles. I do have a
very livable, small leak coming from one of the oil plate nuts, 
which will get fixed at the next change. Motor runs great and
gets about 19 MPG, closer to 20 on the freeway. Compression
110,120,110,120. Its getting a little tired but still has a ways 
to go.
