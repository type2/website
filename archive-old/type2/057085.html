Subject: Re: 009 dizzy on a 2.0 motor

Currently running a 009 with a Weber 2-barrel on a 2.0L solid lifter
engine in a '73 Westy automatic... no lag/bogging on start due to
dist/carb...

	This combination seems to work quite well, and I love not having to
downshift on hills/in traffic

	Automatic tranny makes things a bit sluggish off the line, but it will
cruise all day at 60-65 mph and still getting 19-22 mpg...
