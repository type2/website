I could agree more. We have gathered a collection
of Air Control parts over the years and have sold
many replacement kits to folks all over the county
complaining that some one had removed the flapper
boxes.
Someone of high authority decided years ago that
they were unnecessary. Because of that many buses
are
with out this kit and run much to cool as a
result. If any one from the list is in need of
these parts I have given
them a modest Tony's special discount $89.99
(limited [T2] offer) includes a new thermostat.
These are the
kits for 68-70 up right and 71 offset dog house
oil cooler.  Also includes bracket, shutters,
connecting rods,
and all necessary mount hardware (everything).
We also have 72-79 controls as well.

Amen, preach it brother!! I agree 100% with what
Al wrote. You have a problem
if this guy thinks he is smarter than all those
engineers that VW paid to
design and build the engine originaly. Tell him
you want it as the factory
built it or walk away quickly.
&gt; Justin:
&gt; RUN! Don't walk away from this guy! I think the
air doesn't even go through
&gt; the oil cooler properly without the flaps in
place. At any rate, it's only
&gt; slightly warmer in Georgia than in Germany, an
insignificant number when you
&gt; consider thetempreature of the cylinder heads or
the oil.
&gt; Who knows what other pseudo- science he
subscribes to. Maybe torque the heads
&gt; twice as  tight so as to be better than the
factory? I recently ran into a
&gt; fellow who believed exactly that! I wonde how
many studs he's pulled!)
&gt; The air injector pump was a stop gap emissions
fix to clean up the exhaust.
&gt; Just burned further in the exhaust. Rendered
unnecessary by increased
&gt; precision of the fuel injection, which was
introduced in 1975. In other
&gt; words,
&gt; used only in 73 and 74, I believe.
