Subject: Conclusion of oil plug saga

Thanks everyone (Jim, Tom, Glenn, David and Laura, Michael, Mark &amp; James)
this list has once again proved an invaluable resource.  The VW community is
a beautiful thing.  By the time I received replies on my stripped oil plug
post I had already JB welded the thing in there.  Upon reading the replies I
got I instantly regretted it, went immediately back under and pulled the
plug.  I9m so glad I did, because man that thing came out waaay too easy
after 15 hrs.  And to think I was going to put my faith in that??!!  My
buddy had me convinced that stuff could hold anything, but I should have
waited until I got a second opinion, however I9m addicted to crawling under
the bus every night to do something.  Anyhow, I easily re-tapped it today
(after I cleaned the JB off) with a tap and installed the heli-coil deal.
Flushed thoroughly with oil, I9m as good as new with a spanking new
functional 14 mm plug  and totally ecstatic.  A learning experience in many
ways.  See you on the road! -Nik
