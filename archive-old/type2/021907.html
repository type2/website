&gt;well, first of all, what year is your bus, which engine?

The bus in a 71 Westy.  Stock DP 1600 with Empi header

&gt;Honestly just go add an oil pressure and an oil temp guage

Bought a temp gauge yesterday.  As far as pressure goes:  Should I buy a
mechanical oil pressure gauge or just the normal one that works off the
idiot light sender?

&gt;if you run consistantly over 230/240,its external cooler time,

OK

&gt;also, did you try the dipstick test? (grab the dipstick tube way down where
it goes through &gt;the fanshroud (type 4) if you can hold it your not to hot)
not sure if it really works but &gt;some people on the list swear by it.

I want to take the scientific approach so I will install the gauges to see
where I am at.

&gt;I think the oil light goes on at around 5 psi so IF YOU SEE IT YOU ARE
DOING DAMAGE TO THE &gt;ENGINE. Cant stress that enough. 

It only flickered on at idle.  So I continued to blip the throttle to keep
it off.  I have been using 10w-30 and was told to put in straight 40w and
that would solve a lot of my problems in the 90+ heat.  I will install the
gauge and new oil today after work : )  Thanks for the tips everyone!!!!
This list is great!  BTW I have a few additional questions:

What (in Fahrenheit) is hot?  What is normal?  What is hot but is still ok
to drive?  When should I just shut the motor down?  When it gets &quot;in the
red&quot; do I just shut it down or should I let it idle to cool itself off
first?
