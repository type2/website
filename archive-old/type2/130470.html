Subject: Distributeur and progressive weber kit

Hi everyone!

I bought a new weber progressive kit and a guy told me that I would 
need to buy a 009 distributor to installe my carb. Is this true?

I have a stock distributor on a 1700 cc engine.

Any thoughts/infos to make the best installation of the progressive 
weber??!

Thanks!

Marck
