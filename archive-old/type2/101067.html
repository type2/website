Subject: Re: [T2] Score!!! sliding window parts

Jim,

Yeaaa!!!  Thanks!...just ordered 4 from the local dealer.  For $5 I'll
try them.

As far as I am concerned, that makes everything good on my sliding 
windows instead of having a 99% restored vehicle, it's getting much 
better!

Besides, one of the items on the judges list is window rubber....and I
wanted them to seal good!

Many thanks, dave

&gt; &gt;keeps the aluminum parts from rubbing on each other and makes the glass

&gt; Actually, 19AA is kinda available, but it has to be modified to install
&gt; onto the window.  Looks like they increased the width slightly on the Late
&gt; 87 Vanagon Sliding Window Tracks ever so slightly in the middle of 1987
&gt; (Vin 25-H-118681), then VW promptly discontinued any and all of these
&gt; slider pieces for the Bus and Vanagons up to Early 87 (real stupid I say).
&gt; I got a few of these several years ago for an Ex-80 Vanagon and my 84
&gt; Westy.  They're a pain to install with the window assembly in place, but it
&gt; can be done.  Once done, the window slides beautifully :-)  A buddy who
&gt; worked a Dealer parts counter told me about it way back when
&gt; 
&gt; VAG # 281-847-723 B - Last I looked they're about $1.10 from the VW Dealer.
&gt;  Pick a couple up and try them out.
