&gt;Hiya John,
&gt;
&gt;I don't know the number of the tool but there is one around for removing the 
&gt;escutcheons.  I believe that RMMW had one in their catalog.  Truth be
told, I 
&gt;have always used a pair of needlenose pliers for this job.  Not too graceful 
&gt;but they do the job.
&gt;
O ring pliers will do the job just fine.  If you don't have a set (you need
two pliers for the two type of O rings) buy a cheap set.

Vancouver island and back down the mainland side.
