Subject: 1600 Engine For Sale (WA)

I have a 1600 in my '77 Camper that I am replacing at the end of the=20
month with a 2.0L.

If you are interested in seeing the engine in the bus, I'll be at the=20
Show in Puyallup, WA this Sunday.=20

The camper is blue and white. I'll have signs in the windows that say=20
&quot;BUY MY ENGINE&quot; with info on how to get a hold of me via phone.

Its scheduled to go in the shop on the 18th and I can pick it up the=20
24th. So I am assuming that whoever buys it could pick it up at the=20
shop.

Details:
1600
New Carburetor
NEW Distributor
NEW Sparkplugs
NEW Sparkplug wires
No Heat Exchangers
Only Partial Tin (I think).

I am asking $400.00
