Hi All,

I thought I'd let folks know part of my fleet is up for sale:

1959 (early) Panel.  In storage since 1968.  Restoration started and most
parts acquired.  Has a good cab divider and comes with 2 59 36hp motors
with a good single tip muffler.  This early 59 has ribbed bumpers and
'highly' placed glass taillights.  Not drivable. 15&quot; wheels, nice seat.
Originally Dove Blue. Needs rocker, dog leg, floor, and corner rust
repairs. Good title $600

1960 Double Door Panel.  No motor.  Very stock, has been in dry storage
for quite a while.  Walk through model, but passenger side rear support
has been cut.  15&quot; wheels, decent seats. Sealing Wax red.  Needs
rocker rust repairs.  Good title $600

email for more detail if you're serious and have a way to haul them home
from the Kansas City area.  Both are projects!  8-)
