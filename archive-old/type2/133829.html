&gt; The alternative is swapping in another engine, one that is designed to
&gt; produce more power without strain.  KEP has made the 2.5 liter Subaru
&gt; nearly a drop-in for wasserboxer vanagon owners and it would be nice if
&gt; they could do the same for those who own earlier buses.

Hello Guys    Let me tell you about some problems Subus are having   The 
later 2.2 and 2.5 are having serious head gasket problems . Go to a subu dealer 
and talk to the techs and they will tell you what you don't want to hear. I just 
got thur doing a head gasket job on one about $900.00     You can do the job 
cheaper on the wasserboxer   later and have fun  mark dearing salem import
