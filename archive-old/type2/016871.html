       A magnetic one probably wouldn't be the best idea, since the case
is magnesium and it might be not a good surface to surface fit on the
drainplate. Or maybe it does, but I'd much rather have one that bolted
on, Or even better fit *into* the sump on one of the plates. Much more
efficient, and if you actually need one of these heaters, then it needs
to work. OTOH, in our N. Minn place, our bus spend most of the Winter
parked on the road 2 miles from our house, and no place to plug it in,
and I got along there with just a big battery and a good tune-up. But I
used to spend literally hours with a big honking propane torch under the
skid plate of my crawlers too.
       Or for that matter, I just went out here a bit ago -- it's zero
F. and Vanessa took off first try.
