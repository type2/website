Subject: '70 Westy for sale

There's an orange '70 camper for sale in Annapolis.  The owner parked it a while
back, maybe years, and left it.  Now he says he wants $300 but who knows (?) he
would probably take less.  I checked it out last month and again today.  A lot
of rust on the rocker panels and elswhere. The area under the front windshield
is rusted completely away to about the extent of an inch or so.  Engine seems
intact, though a bit greasy and rusty. Vehicle is all there, rust not
withstanding.  Broken back up light.   Interior is fair to poor.  front seats
about worn out.  Tires barely adequate.  Etc.  Unless a person were dedicated
search and rescue type, this is likely a Parts Bus.  

Anyway I'm passing on it but the number in Md. is (410) 730-0884
