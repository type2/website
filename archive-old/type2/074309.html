Subject: reusing pistons

To the list,

1. If I remove a piston from the cylinder that has about 10,000 miles of
wear, can I slip it back together or do I need to hone the cylinder and/or
replace the rings?

2. If I need to change the rings on one piston due to damage, do I need to
replace the rings on the other 3 pistons?

3. I'm tires of dropped seats on this '73 1.7. Someone mentioned using
diesel seats. Has anyone else tried this? How can I prevent seats from
dropping? Is it as easy as running better fuel? I do have new webers that
were synchronized and I past the emissions test.. but am I running to lean
or to rich?

Any responses would be greatly appreciated.
