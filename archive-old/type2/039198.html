Hi all-
Thanks for all the help on this list, I greatly appreciate the knowledge that is spread daily.

A question for you all: The alternator light on the dash of my 76' bus is flickering for the first 5 minutes or so after I start driving. new belt with good tension, new regulator (bought at FLAPS, so possibly not the right one?) which seems to have been working fine, so I am just wondering if there is a way to test the alternator? 

Another Question: Turn signals which flicker at times instead of blinking regularly. Bulbs all checked out okay and I cleaned the contacts. Possibly a relay of some kind?

I am also looking for a new set of 4 rubber collars- -the ones which attach the manifold of my center-mounted Weber 2-barrel, prog. carb to the four pipes running down to the heads (induction runners?). Anybody know a good source for those?

Thanks for any help. Hope everyone is having a great day! The warm spring rain is falling here in the Walla Walla valley.

peace-
