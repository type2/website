Subject: RE: [T2] Camper Prices going UP!

Not true, I just sold an 82 Westfalia, about an 8 on the 1-10 scale for
$2500.00 (took 3 months to sell!), rust free, new heads etc. Cannot give
away 72 to 75 type 2's with 76 to 79 demanding top dollar 5000 plus range.
68-71 in the 2000 to 5000 dollar range depending on condition. I have over 7
bays I'm trying to get ride of and numerous 60's type ones.

Asking price and the final sales prices vary a lot. Mostly based on Cash.
Most cash buyers are in the $3000.00 range in Texas.
It could be significantly higher in California or the East Coast but I'm
just not seeing on *-bay bidding.
I'm seeing 89 Vanagons going for $1500.00 and 81/ 83 Westys going for as
little as $2500.00 and as knowledgeable people we all know that the need
engines at these prices.

&gt; Sunday a week ago there was a '79 BUS for $5,400 and a '72 camper 
&gt; for $5,250 
&gt; in the Washington Post, both on the same weekend.
