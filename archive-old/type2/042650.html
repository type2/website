Subject: Back indicator not working

My back driver side indicator (right hand drive version in the UK) is not 
working and when I turn on the indicator from the steering wheel the green 
flashing arrow light flashes at about twice the speed that it normally used to.

Is there any simple reason for this ?

The van has just been serviced so I imagine the mechanics must have messed 
something up.

Cheers
