I remembered to go look for the URL
http://www.pelicanparts_dot_com/techarticles/mult_air_fuel_monitor/mult_air_fuel_monitor.htm

I still want to build the Digifant Tool
(http://scribers.midwest_dot_net/midwesty/vw/Vanagon/DigiFantTool/) but for the
AFC of course. It has an O2 sensor monitor feature via a voltmeter. (Note
that the Vanagon O2 sensor apparently tops out at .65V (?) while the Bosch
sensor used in the above article appears to top out at just under 1V.) I
think having a dash mounted display that you could immediately glance at if
you get intermittent rough running could be a big help in FI
trouble-shooting.
