Subject: Re: [T2] what's this?

George, et al:

In the spirit of the holidays, I sent the poor, unsuspecting sot
a message warning
him/her of GEX products... there's no sense in not trying, as I
figure it's just as likely
that the guy/gal is otherwise ignorant, just trying to keep
his/her VW running,
and maybe - just maybe - they'll appreciate the advice, heed it,
and NOT end
up frustrated as all Hell and merrily send their VW to the
crusher.

Karma, folks, Karma.
