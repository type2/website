Subject: Re: [T2] VW emblem anchors

&lt;&lt; The solution to this problem of stolen emblems is to paint a trompe 
l'oil emblem that looks real until you get about six inches away from 
it. Of course, then the vandals might key it. &gt;&gt;

Is that artist available? I wanna get my Bus painted to look like a Bugatti
Royale and really impress my neighbors... ;-)
