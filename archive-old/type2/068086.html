Subject: FS: 67 double sliding door panel

Howdy Volks

I wouldn't normally bore you all with info about cars for sale in Africa
but, as this is quite a rare one and the owner wants to sell it to an
overseas collector, here goes:

1967 double sliding door panelvan, RHD. Make the man an offer. I have not
seen it, but from his description it is in very good condition. It seems to
be complete, down to the cab divider panel, and both sliding doors are
present and in good order. Repairs to the body involved repairing rocker
panel rust and filling in windows cut into the sides. No bodyfiller was
used, only lead.

The following numbers appear on the chassis id plate:
212
240
411 010 012 156 162 175
RH 2166 131383 7098040
217 098 040

I know nothing more about this car except that it is currently resident in
Harare, Zimbabwe. Telephone the owner, Geoff Cruise, at 263 4 498 005 if
you think a RHD double sliding door panel is worth collecting from the
other side of the world.
