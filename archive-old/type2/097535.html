Subject: Re: [T2] steering box 200.00

TRW? LOL.. Are they remanufacturing car parts again? Yeah! They do mainly
aerospace and defense contract stuff, but in hard times they have been known
to reman auto parts as a way of keeping their machines and machinists
working. YEARS ago I bought NEW rims for my '65 T2, and I couldn't find them
anywhere, but one local VW parts house carried some TRW reman'd rims and I
was able to get a new set.
This is good news for us, if it is the same TRW, that is.  Jan B
