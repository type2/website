since I choose to practice a less rational behavior, does it follow I have
the right to demand that those who are more rational service my irrational
actions?

No offence, kind philosopher, you are one of my favorites. Can you fix the

So, since I choose
&gt; to practice a less rational behavior, does it follow I have the right to
&gt; demand that those who are more rational service my irrational actions? I
&gt; don't, but it is certain the majority of yuppies do, hence all the growing
&gt; wizbang on what used to be known as a more inspired philosphy of design.
&gt;
&gt; &quot;Dangit, put that wizbang on there or I won't buy it, no matter how
&gt; rational you think my demand might be! And while your at it, put a TV/VCR
&gt; in the dash to amuse me on my daily commute, dangit, 'cause I like to
watch
&gt; the news while I'm eating and drinking and cell phoning and GPSing...oh,
&gt; and driving, don't neglect the horsepower, I want more next year or I
won't
&gt; buy again on my raw neo-capitalist climb up the ladder to big gotten gains
&gt; so I'll have more power to demand more, rationale be damned.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; It's reason=value for me, not money=reason. I know I'm in the minority in
&gt; this view. It doesn't follow that I will shut up 'cause the majority may
&gt; not appreciate my method.
&gt;
&gt; If a client comes to me and says, &quot;Make this wizbang work, damn the
&gt; cost!!&quot;, I give them the following condition of my employment. I will
&gt; pursue this experiment only if you accept there is no warrenty or garantee
&gt; as to workmanship, parts or results, and I have no basis for any estimate
&gt; at all. Give me a blank check and I will pursue your demand with a sincere
&gt; and steadfast purpose to accomplish proper function through calculation,
&gt; experiment, trial and error, study, intuition, and God's inspiration and
&gt; bill you for actual hours.
