While we're on this subject...

What was the brand of coil used originally on VW? My '73 
Beetle was bought from the original owner and it had a 
Lucas coil.  PO said he thought it was the original, but 
with 20 years and 475,000 miles it coulda slipped his mind.
I kept that coil when I sold the car, replaced by blue coil.
I never noticed any performance change with vacuum advance,
34PICT, and points.  Just fell for the blue coil hype.  Next
time, I'll get the Electronic ignition and Jacobs coil system.
I've seen this setup work on 240Zs very well, prob. will work
well on my bus, too.
