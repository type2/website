&amp;gt; Piston weight matching to the gram.

For the rest of the list...the traditional scale is the mechanical  
triple balance that weighs to 0.1g.

How effective is a more typical scale which is only accurate to 1g?

&amp;gt; I had three pistons at exactly the same weight. One was 6 grams
&amp;gt; heavier. By the time I removed enough material from the base of the
&amp;gt; piston to match weight, the skirt had lost both its longer flanges. In
&amp;gt; other words the side away from the rings is now flat. In other words
&amp;gt; it looks like the top of an open ravioli can. I touched only the
&amp;gt; flanges. The rest of the surface is at the original level.

It's more traditional to take the weight away from the pin boss.

&amp;gt; Is there a problem with this ? When I think of how the piston moves,
&amp;gt; it seems those longer flanges would help the piston to follow its
&amp;gt; movement parallel to the cylinder walls, as the angle between the rod
&amp;gt; and the piston pin changes.

The skirt is there is guide the piston and help it to seal better...
