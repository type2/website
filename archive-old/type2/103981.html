Subject: FI mixture ratio

After digging through recent and archived posts, I'm
about to take my '79 Westy (CA, 2.0 FI) into a shop
with a chassis dyno so they can (hopefully) adjust the
mixture properly, under load, via the AFM spring
adjustment.  These guys do smog checks and
successfully did mine a few months ago, with the
printout and all that stuff.. he did say he tweaked
the air flow meter in order to get the bus to pass
emissions.  The bus has felt just a wee bit sluggish
ever since - could even be my imagination.

My question:  what mixture or CO numbers am I looking
for?  I want to go into the shop and ask for the bus
to be tuned to a slightly rich mixture to be safe - is
this something like 13:1?

Their English is, well, a bit hard to understand so I
wish to be perfectly clear about what I'm asking them
to do, which is to adjust the 2.0 to a safe air/fuel
ratio throughout the power range.

Alternately, if anyone knows a kickass VW mechanic in
the LA (that's Cali, not Louisiana) area that does
this adjustment on a dyno, I'm all ears.

Thanks!

- Randy
