&gt; OK, so I'm doing my first tune up on Speedy.  I went to my favorite VW
&gt; parts store, picked up points, cap, rotor, plugs and inline fuel filter.
&gt;  All ignition parts are Bosch, by the way...
&gt; 
&gt; After I already gapped the new plugs, I discovered there are two of one
&gt; and two of another.  All four are 'Bosch Super' W8AC, but two's boxes
&gt; are asking for a 0.7 mm gap, and the other are 0.6 mm gap.

The gap spec that you use is the one specified for the vehicle, not the
one on the plug box.  0.7mm is the spec in my book.
&gt; 
&gt; OK, let's see what kind are in the motor now.  They are much longer in
&gt; the threaded area, and gapped much bigger than what the book said.  These
&gt; are Bosch as well, W8DC, and gapped to ~0.065.

Do you have a Mexican engine or replacement Mexican heads?  If so, they
are designed to take the long-reach plugs.  Original heads were designed
to take the short reach plugs.  The length of the plug threads should
match the length of the threads in the hole.  

A short plug in a long hole
would shroud the flame front and possibly cause misfires.  A long plug in
a short hole might cause pre-ignition because of the exposed threads
getting hot.  It might even get in the way of the piston!
