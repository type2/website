&gt; by ten and divide by four, and you have your percent error.  It will
&gt; probably be more than you think.

easier way is to hit the sign at a constant 50mph, take the difference in
mph and double it for the percentage difference.... I did it about a week
ago and got a reading of 47mph in my 78 bus, so my speedo is reading 6%
high. (50-47mph= 3x2=6%) (Michen 205/70R 14 MXT tires)
