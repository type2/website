Subject: '74 Smog Heads

Help!  I am in the process of getting my '74 van up to California smog
standards, and I need to know of there are 3 air injection ports for the
heads (from the smog pump) or 4.  The local VW shop here in Brisbane CA is
rebuilding my heads (which had no ports drilled through, just the start of
the holes), and he has the setup for both the 3-port and the 4-port design.  

I appreciate any info on this.

Andy
