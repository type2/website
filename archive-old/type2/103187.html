Subject: tapping a manifold for vaccum port

Whats happening..

I was going to tap my aluminum manifold for a vaccum port and now have some concerns about what size.

It appears that one of my manifolds has been tapped with 1/8 npt.  I am not sure if I want to use a tappered pipe tape though because their is not a lot af aluminum for the taper.  It appears from some black soot that it was leaking slightly so again I don't think the 1/8 npt is the right choice. Any suggestions?  1/8 npt is equivelant to about 3/8 or 5mm dia.  

I need to put a 90 degree barbed fitting in the intake for the vacuum port and don't want to have any intake leaks. 

i am doing this from the suggestion about having more than one cylinder providing the proper vacuum for the brake servo, as that is what was done on stock  34 pdsit's.  I am running duel dells.

Paul.
