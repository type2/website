Hi -

I just got my ignition lock back from Steve's Lock Shoppe in Hunstville,
TX, and it finally works.  It never had a key that worked in it, since
it was changed at some point.  None of the locksmiths around here (west
side suburb of Detroit) wanted to fix it.  Anyway, Steve did a lot of
work on it, charged a reasonable fee, and I'm completely satisfied.
I would recommend his shop for lock work or original VW logo key blanks.
