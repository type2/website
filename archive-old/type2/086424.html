Subject: RE: [T2] AIRS visitors


&gt;   Robin and Peter stayed here (and visited Austin via Greyhound) while
&gt;their engine was rebuilt. A curious thing about his temp sending unit is
&gt;that is was mounted in the bypass valve instead of the usual sump or
&gt;dipstick location. I have never seen or heard of this location being
&gt;used. Comments? Anybody experienced this unit. VDO sender and gauge, but
&gt;the location seems strange. Wouldn't things be hotter there with all
&gt;that metal surrounding the passage rather than sending temp from the
&gt;middle of the oil in the sump?

Peter mentioned that he had his temp sender there, and that he was looking
for a sump-type sender.  Seemed funny to me too. Not that it would be
hotter, but I would prefer the oil-pressure-regulating-area to stay stock!
I had a sump-type sender on my workbench, so he will probably install it at
his next oil change.
