&gt; Hi Dan,
&gt; 
&gt; There's a guy in SE Pennsylvania who scraps out vanagons... He sells  
&gt; a good pair of used front seats for $200US, shipping not included.   
&gt; Email Chris at: JordanVw_at_AOL.COM
&gt; 

He was never very responsive when I emailed him.  I was able to find a
pair of vanagon cap'n seats locally from craigs list.  The vanagon had no
title and the 'owner' wanted $300 for it all.  I got the seats for next
to nothing.  They're in excellent shape, very clean, very comfortable,
and were a breeze to slide in.  My butt has never been happier.  Heh.
That sounds so wrong!
