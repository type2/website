Subject: 1700 exhaust leaks

after rebuiling a 1700 engine and re-installing in my 73.I have exhaust
leaks that I cannot locate.  
I did follow advice and file the exhaust headers flat before assembling.
The reason I beleive there is leaks is because of the loudness both under
the engine and above.
Last night I was running it in the dark and notice a small blue glow under
the tinn next to the intake manifold (F.I.)  
Is there a &quot;hole&quot; in the head that connects to the exhaust port that is
somehow open?  I did not install an air pump, or EGR, but did block off the
egr inlet to the FI air dist chamber.
