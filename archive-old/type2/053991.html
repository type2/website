&gt;Lately the pass. side door lock on my 68 single cab has been becoming harder 
&gt;to open.  Not consistent, but happens enough to be irritating, I didnt think 
&gt;it was going to unlock last time. I was hopeing someone could give me an 
idea 
&gt;of what it might be, and what parts I might need to fix it

This has happened to me, and it is still a problem.  I know what the fix is 
(I think), I just haven't got a round tuit.  If I recall correctly, there is 
a tiny spring, about 2 cm long, that applies tension somehow, and without it, 
the tumblers don't seem to fall into place.  Perhaps you can find a generic 
replacement at a hardware store, or go yank a lock mechanism or two off a 
&quot;junker.&quot;   I have gotten around it by banging the door after trying the lock 
a few times.  This seems to jar something loose in there.  I have also gone 
through two or three keys this way -- try to avoid yoinking on the key too 
hard.  It could break off in there.  The R &amp; R procedure is covered pretty 
well in Bentley.   Hope this helps.
