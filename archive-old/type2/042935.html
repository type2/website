&gt; it's closed.  So if there are no general suggestions to how to fix the door.

trick I have used, you didn't say what year, but on my 78 I had a similar
problem.  
  take the panel off the inside of the door, it just pops off.  inside
there is a cable that runs from the front where the handle is to the rear
where the actual catch is.   there is an adjustment nut on the cable near
the door handle.  tighten up the screw making the cable LONGER putting a
little more tension on the release. if it doesn't make the door open with
the handle it will eventually release the door if you lengthen it enough.

YMMV
