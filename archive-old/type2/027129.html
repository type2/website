Subject: Charging problem -- longish

Hi all!

I need some help with my electrics. I have a '71 bus and had, until 
recently, had no problems with the electrics. A few weeks back, tho, I made 
a 45 min drive with my lights and wipers on part of that time and a small 
fan I installed running all that time. No problems. I get to my destination, 
park the bus, and go in for a couple of hours. I come out and the bus won't 
start. I didn't leave the lights on and the lights and fan still worked but 
no ignition. So I get a jump and drive home, sweating to death with no fan. 
I poke around and see there's gunk on the battery terminals and 
quickly(rashly?) determine I had a bad battery. No problem. I go get a new 
battery and off I go. A little while later, I'm driving to work with my 
headlights on. I've gone about 5-6 miles, pull into a gas station, park the 
bus and go in. I come back out,won't start. Same thing, lights and fan work, 
no ignition. I get a jump, go to work. Well, says I, can't be the battery, 
must be the voltage regulator! Buy a new voltage regulator and pop it in. 
This time, I think, I'm going to test it. I jump in and go for take-out 
dinner. I drive for about 40 minutes with the lights and fan running. When I 
get home, I turn of the van, wait a few minutes, and fire it back up again. 
No problem -- starts like a light bulb. Hooray! Problem solved. Dean for 
Presdident. A couple of days ago, I took another long drive (about 40 mins) 
with the fan on. I stopped at a gas station to wait for someone and when I 
tried to restart, nothing! Lights and fan work, no ignition!!! By know I'm 
beginning to consider selling my van (Just kidding!) The generator light 
comes on when I go to start the van and again when I shut it off. Also, I 
noticed this morning when the bus was idling very slowly (on the verge of 
stalling) the light was flickering. Other than that, I've never seen it on. 
That's why I didn't suspect the generator in the first place. Now, tho, I'm 
beginning to think I may need a new generator. I have a multi-meter but I 
don't know how(if) I can use it to check the generator. What should I do, oh 
Gurus of the List? Am i right in thinking it's the generator? How can I 
check it? Could it be something else? Any help would be greatly appreciated 
since the bus is my daily(ONLY) driver!!!

TIA!
