Subject: Re: [T2] HUBCAP REVIVAL??

Also the replacements available really suck.  My summer drive only bus got two new hubcaps last fall. They are already rusty hunks of crap.  My 2 remaining 22 year old originals have some little specks of rust but nothing serious. What i did to shine up the old ones was use brasso to remove
the rust and polish the chrome and then wax to help slow down further oxidation.  If they are chrome i would not recommend any type of paint especially the chrome metallic sorts as they give very poor results... better suited to arts and crafts than auto restoration.
good luck

&gt; My 1973 has the ORIGINAL chrome hubcaps. I know that replacing them is inexpensive, but since they are the ORIGINAL ones, I want to keep them, (I am sick that way).
