Subject: Re: [T2] Brazilian VW Bus - racist term??

Sigh.  Posting private E-mail to the list is a No-No, as is posting to a 
thread after it has been killed.  Haven't had to do this for quite a 
while.  joe.ames_at_comcast_dot_net has been removed from the list.  Please, no 
more posts on this subject.
