Just wanted to publicly thank David Schwarze for organizing the group order
of Beru spark/glow plugs for us gas heater people. My two new plugs - at $25
each - look exactly like the one I spent $80 for!!!  He did this with
nothing to gain personally. This kind of gesture is what makes this list so
great. Thanks Dave!
