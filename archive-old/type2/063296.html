&gt; i was just talking to a lady at the Trim(Thing) shop and was odering...

Let me get this straight.

In the first place, there is a woman with a business called The Trim Shop.

And in the second place, you were odoring there, or she was??

(Even if I didn't have a bus I would still take this list, because if I
