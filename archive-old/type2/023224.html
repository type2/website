okay, i finally found someone to re-key my hatch lock for me, but here's 
the question....

i have to remove the latch assembly to get to the screw that holds the 
hatch lock in place.  i almost broke my hex wrench trying to get the 2-6mm 
bolts loose that hold the latch to the door.

i put some WD-40 on the bolts and tried again.  is it really supposed to be 
this hard to get the bolts off?  i wouldn't have to remove the latch, but 
there is no way for me to get to the phillips head screw behind it.

then to top things off...i somehow locked the hatch (which i could never do 
before) when i was wiggling my key in there with some lock lubricant.  i 
had figured, &quot;since i can't get the latch off, i might as well lube the 
lock while i'm here.&quot;  well, crappy for me...the door was shut, and i can't 
get it unlocked from the outside...and of course i have a whole mess of 
stuff stacked in the way over the engine compartment.....

with the sun going down...i said to hell with it tonight.......

any suggestions as to how else to get the 6mm hex nuts out??

thank you oh mighty list of mine!
