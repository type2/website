Hi all,
Just a quick question.
I was on the phone with BusDepot recently purchasing, among other =
things, pop top hold downs, (you know, those little rubber &amp; metal =
things that keep the top from flying away.)
Well, on my '72 Westy there are 3 of them.  According to the guy at =
BusDepot, all 3 hold downs
are *exactly* the same.  But on my bus, the 2 side ones are the same and =
the 3rd one, nearest=20
the luggage rack, is different.
Can someone clear this up?  Is the Depot wrong?  If so, where can I get =
this 3rd/different hold down?
Thanks,
-Paul
-'72 Westy
