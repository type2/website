&gt;Now, if that image and message bother you, here's something to do....
&gt;Cut out your Westy and paste it over the Lex*s. Replace the ad copy

Great idea, man.  Just thinking, though, rather than have a bunch of folks
duplicating efforts, perhaps some progressive-type graphic artist(s) on the
list could do up a slick Photoshop job of what Mark's proposed and post it
as a nice downloadable high resolution file from a web site someplace?

I don't have the time, skill, or resources to do such a thing myself, but
I'd sure love to post the subverted &quot;ad&quot; in my office, as a computer
desktop picture, whatever.

I know we've got some pretty talented folks on this list.  Volunteers?
