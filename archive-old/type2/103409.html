Subject: [T2] Wood interior for the Westy

Hey Billy....  I just called to confirm this:


5 foot by 5 foot, 1/8&quot; (3mm) Birch Plywood for only $14.50 a sheet.

Now, ain't that a kick in the . . .


Woodcraft Supply Retail Store
6123 Backlick Rd
Springfield, VA

(703)912-6727

(next to that nice 'family' hardware store, Fischer's...)

I bought a 2 foot by 4 foot piece, and it is nice.

Also from Springfield VA.  Also nice.
