You can also have a place like Kinko's drill the holes for you in the book.
They have a special kind or drill press that does not rip pages (don't try
the Makita : ) )

&gt;I'd be even happier if Bentley manuals had 5/8&quot; in &gt;the gutter, so I could
three-hole drill the manual, &gt;cut the glue binding off and put it in a
three-ring &gt;binder.

Go to your local office supply place and pick up a pack of 3-hole clear
plastic sleeves.  Cut the binding off and put each page in a sleeve.  This
is how most grad thesis projects are submitted.  An additional bonus - the
plastic keeps the pages clean and you can insert additional sleeves with
additional info.
