Subject: Re: VW Soul (or lack thereof)- Reply

I feel as though every VW H2O or Air Cooled has soul along with its
owners.  I have owned two Rabbits(185,000 miles and 220,000 miles)
that were both hand me downs from my father.  I own a Golf in which 
car pool commutes to DC each week with 130,000 miles and never a
problem except I lost a hub cap. Thank you Marion Barry.  My bus  has
94,000 miles on it and is an extension of my personality just like my Golf. 
When all those Saturn owners were calling in to work durng the
blizzards this year to say they couldn't make it my Golf nimbly carried 3
others and myself to DC. No problem.  I look at all types of VW's and their
drivers when I'm on the road and like what I see. I should probably watch
the road.  My point is that these cars are part of the grand VW family.
Yes, VWoA is lame but lets not compare VW's to the Saturn. Apples to
Oranges.  Grateful Dead to Kenny G.  Get my point.  Also, my father has
a 91 Golf, my mom has a 87 Audi 5000 and 94 Audi 100?  I will always
drive VW's. They build great cars, maybe not as effecient as a rice
burner, but the people who drive put themiare in a class by themselves.
