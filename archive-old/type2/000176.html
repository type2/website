&lt;&lt; First question, why would the seal
 suddenly leak grease into the drum?  I didn't tamper with the seal while
 repacking a few weeks ago, and at that time there wasn't a lick of grease
 inside.  When I hammered out the inner bearing, the seal kinda got wavy.
 It's not a very pliable material, but it doesn't appear to be dry rotted. &gt;&gt;

First a common mistake is to completely pack the entire hub cavity.  This is 
INCORRECT.  Think about it where does that grease go at high revs of your 
wheel?  The grease is flung to the outside edge from centrifugal force and 
HAS to go somewhere.  You my friend discovered where it will go.  Of course 
everyone will write in saying I've done it that way for  xx amount of yrs.  
And most vw bus owners OVER analyze everything.  Example &quot;I drive my 66 split 
at 70 mph all the time, and am wondering why I see the temps rise in 
congruence to my wheels being in a proper plane to the earths axis.  I think 
I will install a centio/mano/algorithmic sensor to determine the pressure in 
my engine compartment&quot;  i mean come on folks.  Its a 30+ yr. old TRUCK, has 
reduction box tranny, was designed to go about 55-60 mph.  Geez!!!!  Anyway, 
back to the subject at hand....you only pack the bearing itself, with a light 
coating of grease to the inside hub.  Don't believe me ask any certified 
Porsche or vw mechanic.  Sorry I am an idiot book reader also, but this is 
one place *st.* muir aint got it together.
