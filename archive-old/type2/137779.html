Subject: Re: [T2] horn/light relay

My bus isn't invisible, rude drivers just think they can wait to the
last second before they initiate their lane changes both before
getting out from behind me and after cutting in front of me. I swear
I've looked over my shoulder and seen vehicles right beside me who are
still moving at a 30 degree angle and still half way in my lane! I
think it's a way of showing their disdain and disgust towards me and
my bus.
