&gt; For once, I disagree with you, David. This is my intuition:  An oil that
&gt; transfers more heat also &quot;pumps&quot; more heat out of the engine, hence leaves
&gt; the engine cooler overall. If the engine is cooler, so is the oil in the
&gt; sump. Hence the seeming paradox that an oil that absorbs more heat should
&gt; in fact be cooler. I think I'll give this Kendall stuff a try.

There are 2 ways to test the theory. First, contact Kendall. They have 
the specs on thermal transfer, if they haven't changed significantly in 
the last several years. The second way (more bother) would be to check 
the temp of the air passing through the oil cooler. The air should be 
signicantly warmer w/ Kendall than w/o. If it's working as proposed 
(dropping oil temp 20 degrees) the air temp should go up.
