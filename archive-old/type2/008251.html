Subject: cv joints on 82 westy
Date: Sun, 7 Feb 1999 14:26:30 -0600

Hi Y'all,

Was looking under the westy today to make sure everything checks out for
its first big trip next weekend.  To my horror I discovered that the
passenger side inner and outer cv boots are completely gone.  Unfortunately
I don't have time to do the repairs myself.  If you've ever had this done
by a shop (replaced joints and boots), could you please post the
approximate cost of repairs? Many TIA!

Peace,
Erich Elmer
