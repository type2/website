Subject: [T2] My wife is going to kill me.

I did it again.  I bought my fourth.  I saw in the thrifties this 
morning an ad for an 81 Vanagon $300.

I actually bought this for the engine core.  It runs, albeit not 
well.  I wanted a rebuildable core to build a fresh engine for my new 
(to me) 83.  I originally was going to stick one of my 77 or 78 
engines in this while I rebuilt the 83 but after trying to make it 
fit I find the 78 cooling ducts are in the way of the engine carrier 
and won't work.  To bad as  I have a fresh 77 engine without a home 
right now.


Anyone need any other parts.  This one must be canabalized ASAP, as 
I'm running out of space to store VW's.  I now have 13.33 vehicles 
and that doesn't sound like a good number.

Are the Wasatch Vanner's or Bussers interested in a Spring ritual 
Sacrifice, parts and barbeque party here in the next couple of weeks?


I also have a good 78 case I can part with......$35.

Misc other parts also.  Its either build a new shed or liquidate.

Thanks
