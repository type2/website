Subject: New bus report: Must be busma


I picked up a new 78 bus this Saturday from another list member. I
purchased this bus the way everybody says (from experience) NOT to. Went to
look at it as it was supposed to be a good body for the northeast and
unknown mechanicals. 8 passenger layout, really nice interior, body has
some rust repair, a bad paint job and then surface rust. Some rust on the
front beam. Battery tray badly repaired. 80K on the odometer but no one is
sure if that's right. The tires are TOAST, can't believe they hold air. The
exhaust is strangely pristine except for the muffler, everything is really
nice, the cool tin under the push rod tubes is in place.

The engine was a complete unknown. There is no engine seal which should be
a warning that it may have overheated. The current seller had purchased it
in non-running condition with some bizarre instructions about sticking a
piece of wood into one of the exposed relays on the double relay and there
was some mysterious &quot;extra&quot; wiring on the harness near the double relay
plugs. He replaced the double relay and it still didn't work, so he puts it
up for sale. So I buy it. No compression test, no road test etc etc. Pay
too much for it, but the seller knows I'm hooked (maybe I have a goofy grin
on my face?)

So essentially I had just paid $1000 for a bus that would be free on the
west coast. It might have a blown engine, bad tranny, bad brakes etc etc
etc. I have a spare engine, tranny, complete FI system as spares for my 78
camper, but potential for a lot of labor. On the plus side the owner tossed
in a tow bar and sourced a $100 replacement front beam for me that turned
out to be an awesome adjustable with trailing arms, drag link, KYBs and
brake rotors all attached. I put some plates on it and AAA tows it home for
me.

Sunday afternoon I finally had time to look at it. Get out my VW FI trouble
shooting guide and start with the double relay, test the double relay in my
other 78, works fine. Pull the extra wiring off, no power. Look around and
notice that the wire to the coil is pulled off, in fact the coil doesn't
have the extra push-on connectors for it. Swap coils for a known good,
connect the wire, replace the fuse. Pump now works when I push the AFM
flap. I crank it and no start. So I check the points and they are fried.
Get my spare set of points in there, set the gap with a feeler and it
starts roughly. Get my wife (I can't wait till my kids are old enough to
turn the key for me, but at age 2 and 3.5 they aren't yet) to crank it, set
the dwell with my new $10 dwell meter (thanks to the guy that posted that
to the list) and it runs like a top. I checked the timing and what I saw
while my cheapo timing light chose to work looked within a few degrees of
correct. Still have to do a compression test to see what kind of shape the
engine is in.

The bus has a short on the right side that is blowing fuses when I use the
hazards or turn signals, the alternator light comes on when I rev it so
still some stuff to work out. Additional finds, a very nice 6 ply spare
under the cover in the rear, have to inflate it hard to see if it's dry
rotted. A gas heater that is missing it's fuel pump (the T is gone out of
the fuel line) but the combuster fan comes on when you turn the knob. I
have 2 other gas heaters for spares so I might actually get this one
working. have to go through and replace fuel lines, filler neck and vent
lines. The charcoal cannister was removed but is in 1 of the boxes of parts
that came with the bus.

This bus is also getting a very high approval rating from the wife and
kids. I'm loking forward to a happy bus and hoping my camper doesn't get
jealous and start throwing fits ;-)
