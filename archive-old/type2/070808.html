Subject: Re: [T2] manuals

Hiya Lori,

Bentley's is THE standard shop manual.  It is distilled from earlier 
publications many of them published by VW.  It can be technical and sometimes 
confusing, especially if you are new to all this.  In any event, I have found 
that supplementing Bently is the way to go.  Here are a couple of 
suggestions........

Muir's so-called &quot;Idiot Book&quot; is a delightful read.  It is NOT a Bus specific 
publication but don't let that bother you.  Muir takes the apprach of talking 
you through specific operations while instilling some &quot;VW philosophy&quot;.  
Published continuously since its debut in the late sixties it is usually 
considered the Bible of VW maintenance and repair.

Clymer's publications from the seventies are exceptionally good.  Clymer is 
no longer in business but copies of his Bus specific manual and Shop Manual 
for the VW Beetle can be found at book resellers quite easily.  The big 
advantage with Clymer is that  his publications do NOT assume that you know 
anything.  Everything is explained.  That's a big bonus for a novice.  Much 
of his material was later incorporated into Bentley.

If you have a Bus dating from 68 to 71 VW has an in-house published manual 
just for you.  It sometimes lacks the detail of the other manuals but the 
info is tailored to the early bays and the pictures are great.  Also it does 
outline many procedures skipped by later manuals.

Those would be my suggestions for good manuals to have.  There are others 
(most notably Haynes which is pretty cheap) but these above probably have the 
most to offer somebody new.  If you need ISBN numbers or complete titles or a 
really good place to buy, zap me an e-mail.

Mike
