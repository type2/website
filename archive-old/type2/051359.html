Jason-
This bus conversion can be a joy
or a curse. The horsepower puts you
in the fast lane, but unless you learn the
workings of the engine, it will make a serious
dent in your wallet. Maintenance alone will
make you wince, you can't go to the dealer,
those boys no longer train on aircooled.
Get the Haynes manual and get dirty, it will
be a joy forever.
