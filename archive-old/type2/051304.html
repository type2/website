.&gt; Once I got the old seals out, I found a circular
&gt;spring, and this is what I'm hung up on. I've looked in Bentley and Haynes
&gt;and I can't find this spring shown or mentioned anywhere. It's between the
&gt;seal and the inner bearing. When putting things back together, does it just
&gt;fit in between the two? Can anyone shed any light on this, please?

Not to worry, Jeff- that spring is part of the old seal and must be discarded.
