Subject: Hippies frighten elderly Georgians at Shoney's

Well, they arrived last night after midnight and we stayed up till 
2:00am gabbing VW's before we crashed.

Richard, Jennifer, &amp; Sean  were obviously deprived of rest, as 
they slept until 11:00am this morning.  They got the $0.25 tour of 
the junk/treasure in the house/attic/garage/backyard and we 
went to Shoney's for breakfast/lunch.  The slow-moving elderly 
crowd was uncomfortable yet unwilling to vacate the buffet.

They changed plugs and checked valve gaps and checked 
timing and dwell after several push starts.  We said our 
good-byes and the pulled out around 2:15pm for the remainder 
of the trip to Raleigh, NC.

Say a little prayer for them for trouble free motoring...
