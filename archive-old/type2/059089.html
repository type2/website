Subject: Pick up with enlarged platform

Hi there,

Last week I told you about the Splitty I once saw in a brochure with an
enlarged METAL platform. I have never seen one for real and I am
wondering if one of them still exists. I talked to some splitty fans on
VW-Euro and they had never seen one either. So, if anyone knows of the
existance of a Splitty with enlarged METAL platform, let me know!!! I'm
curious. Here is where you can find a picture out of the 1965 brochure:
