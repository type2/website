Subject: Re: [T2] VW's minivan

What a load of bollocks.  

I'll take my 28 year old fat chick over a freakin' &quot;market study 
statistics indicator&quot; any day.  Interview intelligent people and see 
what they want in a vehicle.  INtelligent people that can fix their own 
vehicles, enjoy camping where there ain't a Motel 6, and people that'll 
eat the grilled hotdogs, even if there *was* a bug on 'em, or if they're 
a little burnt. 

The only way you'll catch me in a Ford, Dodge, or Chevy is if they're an 
ambulance, or a hearse.

Shad H.
