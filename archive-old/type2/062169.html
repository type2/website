Subject: VW canvas

Bad news gang.... I spoke to the gent who owns VW Canvas tonight. He NO LONGER
does pick-up covers. He DOES do Westies, etc.; he is mailing a price flyer,
and I will
post it on the list when it comes in.
 I tried praising, pleading, offering to buy the patterns, etc. No luck. He
sounded
*very* uninterested in the potential of this list to generate enough
pick-up orders
to make it worth his while. &quot;Most folks just don't even have the (metal)
loops anymore, and
I couldn't find anyone to make them&quot; he says. I got the impression it was
ALL made by hand,
and very time consuming. FWIW, he charged those folks in the Volks mag $985
or so for
theirs. He says &quot;they were real tickled with it.&quot; Lucky sobs.
SO. I have the loops! I want a cover! Anyone else out there who makes em?
Anyone have access
to the canvas patterns? I've got a helluva sewing machine here, oughta
handle canvas-Craig
