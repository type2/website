Subject: Build cool shelves in the tire compartment of your loaf!

Hi Volks,

AS I prepare to go to Baja in two weeks, I am reminded of a cool 
feature my 78 Westy has that was built by a former owner.

This wonderful person (whom I have never met) made a nice box of
shelves that slides snugly into the cabinet behind the driver's 
seat (originally intended to hold a spare tire). There are three 
shelves of various heights, with nice wood trim on the front edges to keep
stuff from rolling out. Whole thing is made of thin plywood. I keep a 
cardboard box of spare parts and lots of canned &amp; dried food in there.
We call it the &quot;secret cupboard.&quot; The unit pulls out if you need to clean.
I've got my spare mounted on the front of the bus and we're stoked to get some
extra shelf space. Car burglars and agricultural inspection agents tend to 
overlook it.

The door to the secret cupboard rattles annoyingly on dirt roads if you don't 
wedge an article of clothing into the leading edge, but that's another story.

Drive safely,
Surfer Bob
