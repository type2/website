Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Injection and clutch problems after engine install

&gt; I just put the 2.0 liter back in my 82 Westy after rebuilding the
&gt; heads, installing new rings, and a clutch.  When I go to turn the
&gt; motor over, it drags like the battery is bad but it is a brand new one
&gt; that tests fine.  I hope this is a function of the motor being tight
&gt; after new rings....?

Your transmission ground strap *is* connected, isn't it?  Does the motor
turn freely by hand?

&gt; The motor fires right up and runs if I pour gas in manually but it
&gt; seems that the injections system isn't supplying fuel.  I do, however,
&gt; have fuel at the cold start valve.

Check (a) that the AFM is connected (amazing how often I forget to do
that) and (b) that the FI grounds under the air distribution box are on.

&gt; My last problem is that the clutch doesn't have any resistance when I
&gt; depress it.

I think you need to bleed the hydraulic clutch.  check it for wet spots
before you do, eh?
