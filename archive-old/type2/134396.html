Subject: Re: [T2] Decel Valve

From Steve:
 
When manifold vacuum rises to over 20&quot; (when you take your foot off the
gas) the vacuum coming thru the small hose pulls a diaphram in the can
open and allows air to flow from the big hose around the throttle to the
intake air distribution box.  This prevents an ultra-lean condition on
deceleration and lowers certain pollutants (NOx, I believe).  It also
accounts for the lack of &quot;engine brake&quot; on FI buses.

From Tom:
 
Hmmm.... I'd always understood that the decel valve prevents an ultra-rich
situation which ordinarily would occur when you slam the throttle valve shut
by providing air to allow burning of unburned fuel.  The fact that air is
being introduced by the decel valve seems to jibe with this.

And the winner is.......

Tom.  

Sorry Steve.....  you have it a little wrong  :)
