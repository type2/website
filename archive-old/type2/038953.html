Subject: Parts I would like for The Contraption

     Hi All!

  Just finnished tuning up The Contraption , and changing out the points for
new.All is well.
Cept I'm looking for the rear drivers side ashtray ( This is the one in the
back of a 73 Campmobile , Westy)
The recepticle is there just not the pop in tray.

Also I still need 2 Engine hatch hinges in good condition, any colour, must
be a spare set out there somewhere!

Will pay for either or both + shipping.

On a side note: Does anyone know the dates of the Michigan VW show at Auburn
Hills?
I'm thinking May 24 but may be wrong:)
Anyone going? I'll be there for sure.

Take it easy.
