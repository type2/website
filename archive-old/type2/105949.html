Subject: Re: [T2] wiring help???

From: &quot;ncbus&quot; &lt;macbus_at_mindspring_dot_com&gt;

&gt; Snoopy,
&gt;
&gt; Is the single cab a Euro market delivery vehicle? You can check the
&gt; M-code Plate and translate it from a link in the type2 library.  EMDV
&gt; had two bulds in the tail housing and a red/amber lens. Typically,
&gt; where the left back up light is there will be a red lens. This is
&gt; actually a rear fog light. The right side will have clear for the
&gt; back up light which either market is run off a switch from the
&gt; tranny.

Chris,
The lights that came with it had 2 bulbs and a red/amber lens but don't know
if original. The wiring harness is brand new from Wiring works out of Cali.
Pretty good quality overall...

No fog lights, just regular backup lights were included (SC was a basket
case when I got her)

As for the mcodes, I will have to check when I get home.

Peace Brother,
Snoopy
