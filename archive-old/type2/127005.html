Subject: sagging bus in the back

my friend told me my bus was sagging in the back because i had to adjust the suspension in the rear to make my bus even. When i went to take one of the bolts off i broke the head off one of the bolts i came to see that the bolts and the suspenion plate has been undercoated. How would i break the rest of the bolts lose without breaking any more bolt heads off  thanks for any help listed below is a website link of my clubs vw show in Connecticut check the site out
