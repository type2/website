&gt; Where might I be able to mount a Stewart Warner Model 8332-12 Bus heater??
&gt; I am guessing the orig spot was the aux battery tray but I use that.  Any
&gt; other good places?  Is it one I could mount under front floorboard?

here are some pics of my install:

I haven't finished it completely yet. Basically I have the heater
section in the cab under the seat. the pump/comb air fan sits in the
engine bay. I have enough room this way to keep my aux battery as well
as to get to the spark plug. I haven't pulled the engine with it
installed yet, but it looks like not much would get in the way. I plan
on putting together a bit of sheet metal and make a supply air plenum
to distribute the air comming out of the bottom of the bus. HTH.
