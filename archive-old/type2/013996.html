Subject: Re: [T2] Nut size on the exhaust studs

&gt; Nuts on heat exchanger studs are threaded M8X1.25 pitch.
&gt; They usually fit M13 wrench, but may also come M12,

I find that the 12mm hex is preferable to the 13, as it makes it a lot
easier to get a wrench on the nut in the tighter places.

Same applies to the carburator nuts on a type 1.  Some Japanese 12mm nuts
(such as those used by Honda) have a very nice flange on them which
increases the bearing surface and makes the nut more secure.

&gt; I prefer stainless. I have also seen metric nuts with Helicoils,
&gt;  you may find these on your transaxle, this is a peculiar piece
&gt; of hardware, makes no sense to me. Let's start a &quot;thread&quot; ( pun 8^).

These nuts are self-locking.  As the nut is tightened, the helicoil grasps
the bolt.

&gt; Also, old rusty M8 bolts willl actually decompose ( shrink ) to the point
&gt; you will need a M12 wrench to remove.These will be a real good indicator
&gt; you are in for a difficult removal procedure, so i usually start with the &quot;hot wrench&quot;
&gt; (torch) .

Well, I think the process is called &quot;corrosion.&quot;  Hot things corrode
faster.

I find that a healthy dose of anti-sieze on the exhaust nuts when
installing makes life much easier when removing the nuts.  Don't leave
home without it.
