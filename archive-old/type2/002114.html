Subject: [T2] Need fi/fuel tank advice


&gt; Good Morning,
&gt;
&gt; I have recently subscribed to the t2 list as I have acquired a 78 bus that
&gt; has been sitting for about 8 years.  I have a 68 double cab that I am
&gt; doing major rust repair on as well.
&gt;
&gt; I have been working on VW's since 1966 and have several bugs.
&gt;
&gt; My problem is this....
&gt;
&gt; On the 78 T2 since it has been sitting so long, all of the metal lines are
&gt; full of varnish(hard varnish too!)  I have been working on them this
&gt; morning and it is a slow process.


I just bought a 79 that had been sitting since 95 . I replaced the fuel tank
and all the lines because of the rust and the varnished gas. The fuel pump
worked, but ran slow, so I soaked it in WD40 overnight and it now runs fine.
I didn't have any fuel injector problems, the engine started up first turn
of the key.

Good luck,

Joey
