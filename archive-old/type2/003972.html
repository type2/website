Subject: Re: [T2] cheap tools

That was my point entirely
Here you have two young women with their first bus,and, without getting in
trouble for generalizing, what do you think the chances are of them opening
the engine compartment in the first place. Be like Muir and keep it simple
for them. Be honest now, how many of you actually used a timing light on
your first VW. I know I didn't, my first 40horse,crashbox,fiberglass buggy,
went togeather with the Craftsman beginner kit and broken knuckles. Now
being older and somewhat wiser, I no longer break bolts or bust knuckles,
but then the box is now almost all snap-on, but I had to start somewhere.

&gt; What Hoop said.
&gt;
&gt; I have an eclectic collection of tools gathered over the years.
&gt; Snap-on, Mac, Bonney, a few Craftsman, a few Harbor Freight. Most of the
&gt; former live in my tool box.  In the VWs there lives a small tackle box
&gt; with the tools necessary to emergency repair each of them.  Included in
&gt; that tackle box is a 17 piece HF Pittsburg Forge combination end wrench
&gt; set.  The quality of these wrenches is 80% of my Snap-ons.  The cost?
&gt; $19.95 for the set.  I buy them by the half dozen. If I loose a wrench
&gt; on the road, so what.  The set is cheaper than a 13mm Snap-on.
&gt;
&gt; Additionally in each box I carry 5&quot; genuine ViseGrips, a couple
&gt; screwdrivers, a plug socket with the correct extension(s) for that motor
&gt; and a decent (read Craftsman or swap meet Snap-on) ratchet. A 10mm 1/4
&gt; drive socket and ratchet completes the hard tools.  I also carry a $10
&gt; multimeter in the FI buses and a test light in the carb'd VWs. Total
&gt; expense for each tacklebox? Less that $50 new.
&gt;
&gt; For a timing light, I use an old non-inductive pickup Balkamp.  Metal
&gt; case and nearly indestructible. Cost $5 at the swap meet. I've owned
&gt; inductive pickup lights and they are waaaaay to fragile for me. This one
&gt; works. Though sometimes it'll knock you on your a$$.
&gt;
&gt; I also own a 3/4&quot; drive socket set that I paid the princely sum of $29
&gt; for twenty years ago.  Chinese, Indian, I don't remember... Some third
&gt; world country. The sockets have survived just fine behind my CP 3/4
&gt; drive impact. (850 lbs ft torque).
&gt;
&gt; On a budget?  Home use? Buy the mid priced Harbor Freight stuff. The
&gt; cheap stuff (40pc socket set _at_ $3.99) will ruin fasteners.  Their
&gt; Pittsburg Forge stuff is better than Craftsman. Buy the $20 wrench set,
&gt; the $30 socket set and a selection of their faux Craftsman screwdrivers
&gt; and they pay the shipping. Buy your multimeter and your timing light at
&gt; the local pawn/second-hand store.
&gt;
&gt; You'll have everything you need except the special &quot;use once&quot; tools* for
&gt; less than $75.
&gt;
&gt; * and I can tell you how to fake a few of those...
