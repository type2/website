&gt; That's where I saw mine last night. Let's not confuse the tranny with the

right the tranny is in the front, then the final drive then the engine...
the tranny takes Dextron ATF, the final drive takes 90WT Gear oil and the
engine takes oil.   I use Synthetic in all 3 and unlike the manual trannys
you can put GL-3 or 4 in the final drive because there are no syncronizers
which is what is messed up by GL-4.

&gt; drive the transfer case. I had the NAPA guy tell me he listed a front wheel
&gt; drive auto tranny for the '77 Bus. But he had the rear wheel drive one too.

dang I wanna see the front drive 77 bus,
