&gt; As far as I know the Europeans are still only exporting a subset

I think, and I may be wrong, but each model hasta be tested and
approved before it can be sold in the USA...Puts an extra cost on
each model, so a manufacturer has got to decide which ones
will sell enough to offset those costs...
