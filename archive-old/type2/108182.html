Subject: How To Check Alternator Voltage

My alternator and brake lights came on  while driving and then went out.  This happened a few times in the last two days.  Now the lights are on all the time.

I swapped a working regulator from a friends bus to no avail.

Do I have a short?

How do I check the alternator output with my voltmeter.

Thanks,

Ian
