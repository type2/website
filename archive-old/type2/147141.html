Subject: Lever and linkage on my 77 Westy engine

Right behind, and a little to the left of my decel valve on my 2.0 L engine
is a small lever that stand up and is not connected to anything. It pulls
back and forth, and obviously needs to be used.I looked in my newly arrived
Bentley at the diagrams and that is the only thing that is not labeled.
Could anyone explain to me what this is supposed to hook up to and it's use?

Thanks,

Courtney
