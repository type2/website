&gt; hi i would second the opinion that this is a safare conversion.

Yeah, once I saw the word &quot;Safare&quot; I began my net searches and saw all 
kinds that are similar to mine. I really appreciate this list &amp; the 
quick replies!

&gt; i had a 79 like the one you have pictured when i lived in montana.  
&gt; although i didn't know what it was at the time.  it had the rear 
&gt; storage cabinet instead of the bunk.  i would also guess that the all 
&gt; the seat were recovered later in the vans life as mine had the factory 
&gt; front vinyl seats and some funky fabric on the back side ways seat 
&gt; but, not the set up that you have.  i think they all had sideways rear 
&gt; seat with leg room in between the seats and that yours has been 
&gt; modified to its current configuration.
&gt;
&gt; if you look around in this directory you will find some more pictures 
&gt; of safare conversions.  please don't share the link as i get grief 
&gt; from the computer accounts division when my hits go through the roof 
&gt; because the link made it to one of the lists.

*snipped* for privacy...

&gt; i would also like to ask if i could add your pictures to my reference 
&gt; directory?

Sure. You can do that. If you looked elsewhere in my public directory, 
you'd see my dead and gone VW named Bart. He died in Jan. 2000 in the 
heart of a winter snow storm in Flagstaff, AZ. he was sweet in and out. 
So, now I am restoring this blue beast!

&gt; is this the bus that was on ebay a while back?

Yes, it is. I spent $415 for it. I keep kicking myself for that. I 
hadn't known the engine was not the type II, but is a type IV. The 
engine replacement alone was over $2100. The heads were ruined, the 
cylinders dead, etc. It was a scrapped engine, not worthy of core. The 
van is still in CA as it isn't roadworthy. It awaits a new suspension, 
front end, fuel tank clean out, etc. I won't even talk about the 
interior. The van sat in a police impound for 1-2 years before the PO 
decided to get it out of there and sell it off. Am ambivalent over this 
van. Buyer's remorse perhaps? Or just broke and stuck in AZ while my 
money is in CA? *sigh*
