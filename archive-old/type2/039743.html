Subject: another por-15 question
Content-Disposition: inline

  Hello all! =0)
  Just a quick question about por-15... can it be used in the windshield area to prevent further rust problems? And if so, will an auto paint cover it well with a restoration quality paint job?
  Just wonderin... Thanks in advance
