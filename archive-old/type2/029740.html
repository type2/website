Volks,

I am having a problem with a 1969 bus...  

The input shaft and clutch disc are not reaching each other... We have a
failure to communicate :-)  the pressure plate is an 18-finger plate with
a support ring, the throwout bearing has a support tube in its center.
*Should* these mate? The trans is from a '71 bus, the engine is a 1600
from a bug.  I know little else of the history of these pieces.

                           H Steven Dolan
