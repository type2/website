I have been travelling for 4 years in a Westy (Vanagon and Bus), i have 
seen the 4 corners of North America in those 2 small vehicles, I have 
learn much by doing so, I have met countless peoples, all beautifuls, 
knowledgeable and welcoming. I add many problems along the way, but 
without those problems, I wounds have met as many VW folks and non VW 
folks.

I have spent countless hours working on my site for the sake of others 
so they have some kind knowledge of whats is under the hood., others 
that I hope will do the same kind (or more) trip I did. VW owners are 
one of a kimd, the closest comparison woule be motorcycle guys, but 
still, its far from the unique VW community.Your never alone when 
traveling in a Westy.So I did my first online VW travelling video, its 
about people, fun, sun, camping, culture, discovering and of course, VW.

I made 2, both are in a WMA (Windows Media Players), WMA file are 
smaller compare to a MPG file and more clear. Sorry MAC user but for now 
its only WMA.

current version; Win98 users should download the latest version. 
Netscape user may have to right click and save as if the file doesnt 
open, Explorer folks can open the directly.

The first video is 9 minutes in 320 x 240 high quality, its a big 21 
meg with music (English)

The second video is a shorter vesion, 6 minutes also in 320 x 240 but it 
is a little bit more compressed with French music.

If the file dont open for any reason, go to my main Florida page;

http://www.benplace_dot_com/florida_trip1.htm

They are at the top of the page.

Enjoy.
