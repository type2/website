Subject: RE: [T2] kick panels
Date: Fri, 29 Jun 2001 09:29:04 US/Mountain

&gt;Someone once gave me a good idea for new kick panels, make your 
&gt;own. He mentioned picking up some paneling/plastic/?? from Home 
&gt;Depot and using the old panels as a pattern. 

I made custom door, kick, and roof-liner panels for my 58 single cab out of 
something called &quot;luan door skin&quot; that I got from Home Depot for about $7/sheet 
(3'x7' sheet).  It is just a very thin, nice looking sheet of wood.  

To cut it, either score your lines with a knife or put masking tape down and 
then draw your lines on it and cut with a jig saw or scroll saw.  The scoring 
or masking tape will keep the edges from spintering as you cut.  If you need to 
bend it very much, wrap a hot, wet towel around it for about 15 minutes and 
bend it where you like.  After it dries it will hold the shape.  Paint or stain 
to your liking.
