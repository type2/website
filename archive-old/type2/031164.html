&gt; So, are the reverse lights controlled by the same switch that I have 
&gt; ordered?  My turn signals had ceased to work after my painful heater cable 
&gt; replacement, so I have no idea if the back up lights stopped working at the 
&gt; same time.
&gt; 
&gt; If it is not the same switch, where should I begin to look?
&gt; 
&gt; I have an automatic transmission.
&gt; 

I'm glad you mentioned you have an automatic, because that changes the
answer.  First, no, the reverse lights have nothing to do with the hazard
flasher switch.

On an automatic Bus, the reverse lights are controlled via a switch in the
base of the shifter on the cab floor.  You may have to get in there and
take a look.  While you're in there you can get the light that lights up
the gear selector display at night working :-)

On a manual transmission Bus, the switch is actually screwed into the side
of the transmission and power comes from the ignition coil.  I'm not sure
if the automatic version is powered via the coil or not (don't have the
Bentley handy).
