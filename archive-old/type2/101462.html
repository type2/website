&gt; You need to tap the case and use a tapered threaded pipe plug in the
tapped
&gt; hole. The correct size plug (ergo tap) is 3/8-18 NPT and the drill needed
&gt; for it is 37/64. If you use a shop-vac around the hole while drilling and
&gt; tapping, most of the swarf will stay out of the gallery as you go. The
plugs
&gt; should be available at any decent industrial supply, you want the ones
that
&gt; have a recessed allen socket. They are readily available in steel or
brass,
&gt; the brass ones are preferred. While you are at it you can do the other
plugs
&gt; as well if you are so inclined. There are five of them on the case, I
think,
&gt; but the ones on the front of the motor (flywheel side) are the ones that
&gt; always fall out. If you recently overhauled your motor, chances are you
have
&gt; higher oil pressure as a result, and that has forced the gallery plug out
of
&gt; its bore.

37/64 is .578&quot;, and gives 73% thread depth.Good for steel application.
Magnesium or aluminum will tap better with 9/16 ( .562&quot;) and is a more
common drill bit. Most Type 1 and type 2 case plugs can be tapped with
a combination of 1/8, 1/4, 3/8,and 1/2&quot; NPT allen pipe plugs.I prefer
aluminum for this application, including the plug for  the oil pump output
in a full-flow modification. Brass is next. The original plugs are aluminum.
It's more obvious how they can fail when you remove one and realize how
little
clamping force is provided. Drill a hole in the plug and remove with an
autobody
slide hammer, or thread in a screw, then claw hammer if you are very
careful.
Do not use teflon tape on the new plugs.
