Subject: The type2 mailing list members site... (map)

Hi everybody,

Today is a great day! I want to celebrate with you for the official 
opening of the NON OFFICIAL type2 mailing list members site.

This site present to you the north america map, where all the members of 
the type2 mailing list are registered.

Go see it and tell me what you think about it! There is always place to 
modification.

The site is at http://www2.zone_dot_ca/~jblp/type2

I want to thank you for your participation. I received 138 &lt;&lt;Re:Where you 
live?&gt;&gt; and every body is now registered in the map.

I have put pictures for some of you. Go at the LAS-VEGAS page to see what 
it give with pictures.

For those of you who want to send me a picture: no trouble, it's really 
easy for me to add it!

For this site, I have made something really simple. I made a data-base on 
SuperCard. And I write a superCard srcipt that automatically create HTML 
documents. So it's now really easy to me to make modifications to the site.

If I have made a mistake on your identification, mail me the good 
informations, and I will make the corrections.

I haven't access to a cgi on my server. So I do an ilegal thing ;-) I use 
a cgi that I have found on www.uclassified that create a mail document 
from a form. I modified it to mail the document to me.

If someone of you have an access to a cgi, I will be happy to use a legal one!


Give me your suggestions and your comments.

For those of you that aren't on the map, register via the site.

hope you like it!
