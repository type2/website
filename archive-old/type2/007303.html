&gt; I recently purchased a '71 Westfalia and the steering makes a

to be ok...
&gt; ...Will I need a whole new steering box? These are pretty expensive,
&gt; around $300, so if someone knows if the box can be rebuilt...

If the clunking is accompanied by a &quot;rough&quot; or &quot;catch&quot; feel in the
motion of the steering wheel, then I fear that a replacement is in
order.  I had to do this on my '71 and I found a good box in a
wrecking yard for $20.  (U-pick yards in So Cal don't distinguish
between expensive VW parts and run-of-the-mill Chevy parts, so if you
find a box in a VW-only yard you will probably pay more.)  You can use
any box from '68 through '72 inclusive, later boxes won't fit.

The biggest problem I had with the replacement was removing the pitman
arm, which is on a tapered splined shaft.  I had to try three at the
wrecking yard before I found one that would come apart, and the arm on
my bus yielded only after I bought a Chevy pitman arm puller, made an
adapter for the smaller VW shaft, cranked it down to the point where
the heavy cast iron puller was flexing and then threatened the arm
with an acetyline torch.  The arm popped loose with a bang as I was
lighting the torch!  I think that the problem is that the large nut
has a fine thread and a relatively low torque value for such a large
nut.  People tend to overtorque the nut which pushes the arm further
onto the tapered spline than it should be.  Use antisieze on the
splines and don't overtorque that nut!  The cotter pin will keep
things in place nicely.

OTOH, if the steering is smooth, but clunks, then a steering box
adjustment is in order.  Bentley has the procedure.  Be sure _not_ to
overtighten the adjuster, which will kill the box.  Work up on the
correct setting a tiny bit at a time, retightening the lock nut each
time before testing the play. The steering has minimum play at the
straight-ahead position, and more play away from that position, so you
should only adjust play with the wheels pointing straight ahead.

Before you go to adjusting the box, be sure that the problem isn't in
the linkage.  Make sure that the swing lever (that bellcrank that
pivots on the center of the axle beam) only swivels back and forth and
that its ends don't move up and down at all.  If they do, you need
swing lever bushings.

Now you know why I feel so strongly about non-standard tires on the
front of buses.  Steering boxes are a bear to replace and darned
expensive to boot!  The less stress we put on them the better!
