Hey Steve,

On your oil choice, have you thought about trying
Castrol Syntec.  It's 5/50, so it should be good all
year.  

Your HIOP is second only to Bob's.  I think you're
right about it not being a mystery, but rather very
careful attention to tolerances.  Bob's low end
rebuilder thought the real trick was to get a great
grind on the crank, and claims he only knows one
person in Baltimore that can do it right.  I hope to
test out this theory within the next few months.

Rob
