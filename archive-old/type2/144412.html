Subject: Re: [T2] BusDepot Website Navigation / Finding Parts

Ron, all,

&gt; 1) The &quot;View all of the above parts&quot; button on each page (which makes the
&gt; page display every part in all of the categories shown above the button),
as
&gt; Billy mentioned

I know I've missed some parts by not remembering/seeing this button.  I think
the same thing happened to Gerald.  He said he looked all over for the MC
grommet.

&gt; (By comparison, the search box in the
&gt; left yellow menu bar always searches the entire database at once.)

Is there a search window to put in a part name rather than a #?  I would like
that.

&gt; 3) The green &quot;i&quot; icons next to some part categories, which take you to
&gt; various Info pages (pictures, diagrams, etc.)
&gt; Our Help page does have navigation tips at
&gt; &lt;http://busdepot_dot_com/help.jsp#FINDPARTS&gt; and search tips at
&gt; &lt;http://busdepot_dot_com/help.jsp#SEARCH&gt; . If you read them you'll get a lot
&gt; more out of the site, but of course most people don't.

I've read all of these, and the info and specifics on various parts and items
is, to me, one of the finer points of the site, and shows a lot of time/care
invested.

&gt; you click on a specific part and go to its &quot;details&quot; page, you do have to
&gt; use your browser's &quot;back&quot; button to get back into the drilldown again. I am
&gt; aware of this idiosyncracy and hope to fix it relatively soon.

This is where I always get lost.

I didn't want to come off as a BD basher, I'm not and have never been.  I'm
just using the site more now than ever and noticing things more.

Bus content:  I hope my BD order comes today so I can do my brakes and
winshield seal this weekend.

Billy
M'Boro, TN
