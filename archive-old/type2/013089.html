Subject: [T2] Rudy's back on the road!

Hi Volks,

My 1972 Westy pop-top is back on the road with a newly rebuilt 2000cc with fuel injection.  The old engine was a 1700cc carbed.  I LOVE this new set-up.  The Tech Shop in Seattle installed it.  They did it to factory specs!  The engine is from AVP via the Bus Depot (thanks guys!).  FI from junk yard. I was able to keep it afforble.... ....that's why I bought the bus!

No questions, just now.  Just want to express my gratitute at this list as it helped my find reliable sourse for parts and break-in instructions etc.

Happy Motoring!

Rae &amp; Rudy Bus (not smoking/burning oil :-D
