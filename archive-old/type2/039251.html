Volks,

As some of you know, I now have the '81 Riviera.  Thank you for those of you
who helped me identify it.  I have to say that I love it much more than the
'77 standard I have, but just because of all the camping stuff.  But alas...

I don't know how these things work.  I can pop the top, fold out the beds,
and do the stuff my kids can do.  They like this one better too.  I don't
know how to make the fridge work, and I don't know what the big fuse box
behind the drivers seat is all about.

Can anyone help me with the proper procedures for making these work?  Or
point me in the direction of where I could get a manual on these?
