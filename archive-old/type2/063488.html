Throughout the '80s I used Fram oil filters (PH2844).  Since then I have
used Mann and lately Mahle (made in Austria) brands.  I have never had one
bulge or explode.  Perhaps oiling system faliure causes this bursting??

I can't find Bosch oil filters in town and the Autobahn brand at the VW
dealer co$t too much.  Just another data point...
