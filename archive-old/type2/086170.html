&gt; Subject: I'm trying to be a nice guy -- with no luck
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Hey there!
&gt;
&gt; I have a '72 Westy that is on its way to the scrap yard.  The engine and
&gt; tranny are shot and the interior is stripped. . . with one exception: this
&gt; bus has one of those mid-compartment air conditioners that pokes up from
&gt; behind the driver's seat.  I don't want the unit, but I figure that there
&gt; must be someone out there who does.
&gt;
&gt; A friend of mine posted this a/c unit's existence on a VW bulletin board,
&gt; but
&gt; no one contacted me about it.  I currently have it on eBay (I'm
&gt; only asking
&gt; $30 because I figure my time to remove the unit is worth
&gt; something), but no
&gt; bids have come in.  The item number on eBay is 1825645594 if you want to
&gt; take
&gt; a look.
&gt;
&gt; Obviously, I'm not trying to make a killing here.  I just have a hard time
&gt; believing that there isn't someone out there looking for this
&gt; unit; someone
&gt; who, when they see it will say, &quot;That's it!  That's the one I've been
&gt; looking
&gt; for all these years!  Hooray!&quot;  I sure would like to see that someone get
&gt; it.
&gt;
&gt; If you have any suggestions on where I might find that someone, please let
&gt; me
&gt; know.  As it stands now, I'm having the bus hauled away on
&gt; Saturday, May 11.
&gt; I'll be happy to pull the a/c system out before that happens if someone
&gt; wants
&gt; it.  Otherwise. . .
&gt;
&gt; Please let me know if you have any ideas.  Many thanks.
&gt;
