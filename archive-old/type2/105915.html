&gt; Could anyone define whether a high or low temp differential means there is

I called the VW shop back for clarification and was told that accepted
standard is that the temperature difference between the front and back of the
cat should be at least 80 degrees. And, a cat that is working well will
generally have a 100 degree differential.
