Subject: Re: [T2] Timing questions

Blake,
	One of the first things you need to look at so that many people
	much more experienced than me is what dist. is installed in your
	bus. Timing a 009 dist. (which isn't stock) is different than
	timing the correct vacuum advance dist. Take a look at the numbers
	on the side of the dist.
