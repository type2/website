Hi Snoopy,

I had to do this once a couple years ago...

It was suggested to me that you can just as easily power the coil from 
the side marker lens. Hooked up from there, the engine will die as soon 
as you turn the parking lights off.

Happy trails,

&gt; I took Bill's advise and tried this again. It didn't work before we 
&gt; switched
&gt; out the coil and condenser but does now.  I shall be looking for a 
&gt; short
&gt; tomorrow.  But at least I can drive to work  :)
&gt;
&gt;   If you need to get to work tomorrow you can make a jumper wire from 
&gt; the
&gt; postive side of  you battery to the coil. You will still need the key 
&gt; to turn
&gt; the starter and keep the steering unlocked. You will have to remove 
&gt; the jumper
&gt; to turn the bus off though.
