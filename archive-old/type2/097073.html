Subject: Re: 63-71 Euro tail-lights into US spec Bus

 Hello,
Thanks for the responses.  I think I will probably go with Matt's info which
is here, or Sean Dorman's idea of just running a wire from the master
cylinder along the wiring harness back to the brakes.  But first I must ask
a few more questions to Matt:
 Sorry about misreading whatever it was I read.  I just did a search of the
archives and read something about Euro tail lights, but didn't realize it
was referring to Euro to US lights!!  Oh well.  Anyway, you said here to:
&gt; &gt; You disconnect the wire between the turn signal switch and the brake
&gt; &gt; light switch.  This makes the turn/stop wires into turn wires only.  On
&gt; &gt; your Bus, this is probably done most easily by unplugging and taping up
&gt; &gt; the 54f wire at the hazard flasher switch.
&gt; &gt; Also at the hazard flasher switch, the 54 wire is the one you want to
&gt; &gt; connect to the &quot;freed-up&quot; tail light wire to run to the rear for the
&gt; &gt; stop lights.  Unplug the 54 wire from the hazard switch and the tail
&gt; &gt; light wire from the fuse box, and connect these two wires together.
&gt; &gt; Use a jumper wire if needed.

OK, that's cool, easy enough, but will my 'Zerds (hazards) still work?

  Doing this conversion to a US Bus puts the
&gt; &gt; brake lights on an 0.75 mm^2 (~18 AWG) wire, which will result in more
&gt; &gt; voltage drop and less brightness at the brake lights.  To get around
this,
&gt; &gt; leave the tail light wiring alone, disconnect the turn signal - brake
&gt; &gt; switch wire, and run a new 14 AWG wire for the brake lights.
&gt;
 So do you think I should just unplug the wire out of the master cylinder
and run a new one to the brake lights, with a jumper wire?
Thanks again,
Paul
