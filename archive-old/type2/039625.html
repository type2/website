On some of the early FI systems, that's the way they work. The later system
just prime similar to the Ford you describe. Neither system is designed for
key ignition on and the motor not running for more than a few moments.
Check your fuel pump relay and/or voltage at the pump. A flaky relay can
give your symptoms. A fuel pressure test can determine pressure delivery
and regulator functions so you don't have to guess and end up wasting money
on something that doesn't fix the problem.

Hesitation and stalling could be as simple as a cracked distributor cap or
old spark plugs as well as a clogged fuel filter and a good number of other
things. Verify mechanicals, then ignition system, then fuel system, in that
order, or you can miss the foundation of the problem with several
iterations of bad diagnosis based upon screwdriver pokin and a-spectalatin'.
