Subject: safare poptop seals

 I have a 1973 Safare pop top that I'm currently rehabilitating after 9 
years in the bushes. As far as I can tell it's almost identical to a 
Riviera pop top. I need to replace the seals for the top and the front 
roof rack, can I use the Westy seals?? My top pops straight up and 
there's no brackets or anything to hold a seal on, just the bare 
fiberglass edge. All that was on there was that &quot;U&quot; shaped plastic 
edging that I've seen on boats to finish off an exposed 'glass edge, it 
certainly won't seal anything. Will that stuff work???
