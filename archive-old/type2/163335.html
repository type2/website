Just thought I'd pass along that Airhead Parts/Ventura Warehouse Grop (VWG)
have two new items available

022-903-655  Alternator Air Exhaust Elbow/Boot.  Fits 75-79 Bay Windows
equipped with the 70-75 amp Alternator (and the Porsche 914 with the same
Alternator).  Comes with the spring clip and clamp.

021-119-245  Oil Dipstick Tube Boot.  Finally, a Disptsick Tube Boot that
installs relatively easier and lasts more than the reported 3 month (or
less) average (I think fruit flies live longer &lt;grin&gt;) lifespan of those
available for the past several years.  Made of high quality VITON for the
best heat, oil and ozone resistance.  I've had a list member testing the
final approval sample on his Bay Window some time now with very ggod
results.

There is also a few more Type 2 items on the New Products page if you wish
to peruse them:

Ignore the &quot;Temporarily Out Of Stock&quot; blurb (except for the 131-405-670 axle
nut, they're on backorder).  The inventory module hasn't updated (it will
over the weekend).
