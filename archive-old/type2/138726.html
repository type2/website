Subject: Re: [T2] Parts hunt NOW finished

Thanks to Richard! I tried to send him and the list a note of thanks for his 
help in locating a timing scale, but the list blocked me for too much quote. 
So here is the jist of what I sent him. Beaudry had 8 timing scales they now 
have 7. :) The price was $8.32 plus shipping. If anyone needs one, act fast. 
I sent Emails to a lot of dealers in the south west and very few had any.

THanks for the help

&gt; Give them the 021119249E part number right away and if they ask you which
