Subject: cats and rev limiting rotors

I was reading the Bosch L-Jetronic Lambda FI manual and came across an interesting passage that basically stated that a rev limiting rotor cannot be used with a catalytic converter because at the rev limit when the distributor cuts off, the unburned fuel would pollute the catalyst so instead the engine speed has to be limited electronically.

Do the California ECUs have this feature or did they still rely on the 04016 rotor? It would seem to me that all ECUs with the trigger wire going to the coil wouldn't pulse the injectors at the rev limit and this would be the equivalent of electronic engine speed limitation.
