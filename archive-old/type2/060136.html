Subject: Noisy electric fuel pump

My bus is a 72, running a two barrell Weber with electric fuel pump in
right rear wheel well.  Is this a stock Fuel pump?  It seems to operate
fine but is very noisy...made me think my valves were out of adjustment. 
Is this normal....is this a sign of impending death?  Thanks...
