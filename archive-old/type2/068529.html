Hey

&gt; 
&gt;  Anybody else get their new issue of Camp Box News?  


just got it yesterday

Mine came today,, I was
&gt; beginning to think that Todd had dropped off the face of 
the earth!!!!

well he blames the whole thing on some on going lawsuit re: 
a car crash he had a few years ago. I haven't seen a Campbox 
news since last april so this is definately a hiatus! he 
claims it will never happen again FWIW

The mag has done good coverage on the evolution of westy 
roofracks and will now be focussing on tents
