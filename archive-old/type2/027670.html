Hi All,

	I took my wife and daughter out for Ice cream in my 70 Westy
Saturday night. About 2 miles form home on the way back, the gas pedal drops
to the floor and the engine drops to idle. I Coast into an Osco parking lot
and check it out. The bracket that the pedal and cable attach to has broken
clean off the pin. I try to get something together and manage to break the
throttle return spring on the carb (the spring was way to strong, and
probably contributed to the failure). As I am under the bus getting greasy
and cursing, a fellow bus owner (not in his bus) stops by and offers
assistance. Turns out I know him from a few years back. He has a 69 bus and
I had been wondering who owned it, busses being fairly rare here in Brockton
MA. He was on his way to pick up pizza for his family and I told him to go
ahead, as I had the situation in hand. I set the throttle at about 3/4 open,
and made it the rest of the way home, just making it up the last hill in
first gear, without needing any more throttle adjustments. 
	Sunday afternoon I took the parts off my parts bus and got her
running good again. I think I will look for this part when I go to the
Litchfield bug in this weekend. Any other list members heading down there
from south of Boston? I am still undecided on whether or not to take my Bus.
If there is a carabus I could join, it would make me feel a lot better about
it. I just can't imagine driving all that way at 55mph, but I guess the
journey is to be enjoyed, not rushed. 


Jeff
