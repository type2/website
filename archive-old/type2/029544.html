&gt; Recently installed combination oil pressure/idiot light sending unit  in

&gt; it,  and used some Teflon tape on the threads, then  reinstalled.  Very
&gt; frustrating! Still leaking!   I have 0 tolerance for leaks or rattles in/on
&gt; a bus.

&gt; Read in the archives where Sean used some *Permatex* blue silicone on the
&gt; threads, and stopped the leak.  I am thinking of trying that, but,  was
&gt; wondering if it would be better to use a little *Fast Weld* epoxy putty on
&gt; the threads

I don't think that I would want to use anything as permanent as epoxy on
the threads.  Try some Hylomar.  It stays liquid, but is viscous enough to
seal the leaks.

I've never had good luck with teflon tape.  Better to use something that
flows..
