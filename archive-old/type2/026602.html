X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Hello Everybody:

I have a 71 bus with power disc brakes that operate off of intake manifold
vacuum.  I recently installed a new Weber progressive carb with a new intake
center section that didn't have a vacuum fitting to plug my brake servo in
to.  I drilled and tapped a 1/2&quot; hole near the base of the center section
that the carb bolts to, and plugged in the vacuum hose that runs to the
brake servo.  The problem is, when I step on the brake pedal, the engine RPM
starts running really high, at least 2000 RPM.  When I'm at a stop, I
usually just engage the parking brake so I don't over-heat my engine.  I
didn't have this problem with the stock carb.  I know that the engine isn't
timed exactly right, since some PO put several different marks on the crank
pulley and I don't know which one is right for timing.  I'm going to buy a
degreed pulley today and install it, so could the racing problem be caused
by the timing being off, or do I have a more serious problem??  Any help is
appreciated.

Thanks!
