Subject: HELP! Exhaust screw fell outHELP!

hey now,

well, on the way to work the exhaust screw on cylinder #3 came out again.
it's happened before but i managed to screw it back in. now i don't have
my tools with me...was working on the '77 westy today. ACK! i've got flame
shooting out of it and it's making a horrible racket. i managed to find the
screw.

i'm going to try and get it back in at break...BUT if i can't, will it harm
the engine to run it without the screw? i drove the final 5 miles to work
without it. the engine has just been rebuilt and i don't want to harm it.
i noticed that it was hotter then normal around that cylinder but the rest
of the engine seemed cool enough.

and i just checked the valves and set the ones that were a bit loose. i don't
think this has anything to do with it but could it?


you help is greatly appreciated!
