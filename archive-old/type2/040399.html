&gt;With heads off and one needing replacement due to cracks around exhaust

&gt;whether to replace or rebuild pistons and cylinders? Also should I replace 
&gt;the uncracked head to match the other one, or should I only have a valve 
&gt;job done on it to match the rebuilt one I plan on? I assume both heads 
&gt;need to have valve jobs done at the same time, is this correct? Thanks for 
&gt;any words of advice!

Combustion chambers should both be the same shape - there was more than one 
shape used.  Combustion chamber volume should be identical - check for 
flycutting.  It's better to have the valve job done on both heads.  Once 
you have the head off it's cheap insurance (and you'll have to remove the 
other head anyway to check the combustion chamber).  Use new good quality 
(TRW or equivalent) exhaust valves every time.  You can regrind the intakes 
once.  If it were my bus I would replace both heads with a matched pair 
with NO thread inserts in the spark plug holes, and keep the extra good 
head as a spare.  Carry it under the rear seat and you will never have any 
cylinder head problems.  :-)

If the compression was okay you can probably leave the cylinders and 
pistons alone, but if you're curious you can pull the cylinders out a 
little and check the cylinder walls for scoring.  Be careful not to expose 
the rings completely unless you want to reinstall them.  Also be careful to 
keep everything clean while you do this.  You can wiggle the rods to check 
for obvious slack in the bearings - you probably won't find any if you 
weren't hearing noises ahead of time.  Look at the cam lobes too -  any 
detectable wear and you may have a rebuild in your not-too-distant future.
