Howy Volks-
I've finally decided to to put my '73 Westy together.
Actually, I'm moving in a few days and I was trying to
figure out how to tow it to my new house, when my wife
suggested(strongly) that I just put the engine in it
and drive it over there. Okay, so I start putting the
engine together, drive down to the FLAPS when my '70
daily driver decides to start blowing smoke- lots of
it out of the breather exhaust tube under the engine.
The smoke looks and smells like exhaust, and is
accompanied by a new clank-clank-clank. I have yet to
drain the oil or do a compression check, but I'm
guessing I'm probably missing a ring at the VERY
least. Any other thoughts?
Looks like I'll be driving the '73 for a while. I
would love to throw in another engine and tranny (read
more power) in the near future. I'm thinking '78&gt;
set-up. I noticed an '82 at the local yard today.The
top of engine was burned, FI and all plastic
components were garbage. Would this fit in a '73? Is
it compatible with my tranny? The '82 has an automatic
in it, so I have no interest in the tranny. This is in
the Palm Springs CA area if anyone else is looking for
an auto tranny.
Thanks,
   -Kent
