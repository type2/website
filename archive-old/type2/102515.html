Yes, and it was one of the poorest engineering jobs they could have had.
It's a pity that they couldn't add a real engineer to the cast.

They bought that engine more for the chrome than for the power.  IIRC the
propeller was mostly shrouded by the rear hatch and they had to trim the
outer portion of their propeller severely to make it fit  Obviously they
didn't watch the second season of Scrapheap Challenge (Junkyard Wars).

All of these resulted in poor performance in the water.  Also, their
sealing was poor, which led to the road engine being waterlogged while in
the water.  I doubt that the NB made it out of the water without some
camera magic.  They did manage to propel the dead new bug on land with
the aircooled motor and propeller, as the NB's engine wouldn't start due
to water.

IIRC, they did something similar with a full-size bus, which was tested in
Lake Havasu with Ronnie's bus in the background.
