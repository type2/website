Subject: drive your bus daily?

Hello,

So, do you drive your bus every day? I do. Its a camper, which I guess is 
odd to drive every day, but living in a place like San Francisco, I can't 
exactly keep as many cars available to me with nothing but street parking.


I ask because of some bad experience with a local repair shop in Daly City 
called Tassi. I called a few days ago, told them the specific job I needed 
to have done, which should have given them a slight clue as to the amount of 
time needed to do it, and they said they could do it on saturday.

So, I arrange a time with my wife where we can drop it off, she can pick me 
up from work, and I can take a Cab over there when I get off of work on 
saturday to pick it up when finished. Christ, im so mad at them right now I 
can hardly type. I DIDNT CALL WITH ALL OF THAT INFO JUST SO THEY COULD SIT 
ON THEIR THUMBS ALL DAY AND ASSUME I DONT NEED IT!
I call at 3pm just to check up since I never heard from them, and &quot;sorry 
dude, we've been so swamped we couldnt take a look at it yet&quot;

What? They waited on everyone that drive into the shop and waited for their 
cards today, pushing my job back? Why in the (*&amp;) did I drop mine off last 
night? Why did I have my wife bring me to work this morning, why am I going 
to blow more money on a cab now to pick up the bus they never even looked at 
for a second??????? what kind of repair shop functions like this? Is this 
some kind of cocky &quot;were the only aircooled veedub guys in the area&quot; - screw 
me, just deal with it cuz they are my only option attitude?

*deep breath*

everythings fine, it will work out, but some people need to just come 
through even 10 damned % of the time on what they say, or not bother even 
trying. slow results I could deal with, but complete and total lack of 
ANYTHING being addressed at all, when I was given the impression it would be 
DONE today, just frosts my grandmothers arse.

Time to call Freds in Redwood city to see if they can get me in instead, 
even if it is another 20 minutes out of the way.
