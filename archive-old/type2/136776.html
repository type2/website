Subject: Re: [T2] It's the wrong color, Grommit

But I don't want to get busy with the bodywork. I want a bullet-proof 
bottom end, a solid engine, CDI ignition, fully revamped braking and 
suspension first.

Having an incentive to do bodywork will just nag at me while there are 
more important things to do. (It's not like road salt is going to eat 
the bus away in San Diego.)
