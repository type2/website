Subject: Goodwill to all (freebie)

Hi,
 In the spirit of peace and goodwill (and clearing out a closet)....
I have some new (organic) brake pads for the 73-? bus folks.  Free to
first person who want's 'em.  I drive a '71 and the FLAPS sold me some for
a 73+  (the F in FLAPS isn't for &quot;Favorite&quot; anymore).

Anyway, rather than going the refund route without a sales slip, I'm
giving them away in a gesture of thanks for all of the
interesting/fun/informative mail that has overloaded my in-box since the
days of vanagon_at_lenti.  

Greg Schmidt
Fredonia, AL
'71 Westy  &quot;Patience&quot;  (still needs a rear bumper....)


p.s.) I love the upper cot replacement canvas I got from PLF.
