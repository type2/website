Subject: Re: [T2] Back to the PaintScratch

Hiya Michael,

Head on down to your local NAPA store.  Many of the larger NAPAs have a paint 
matching service.  The tech at my NAPA (Beaverton Auto Parts) even went out 
in the parking lot to match his formula with my weathered 35 year-old finish.  
Try matching that service online.  And, yes, they will bottle the paint in 
spray cans.  Cheaper (IIRC) that the online guys also.
