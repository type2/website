Hello,

I the proud Dad of a cancerous 1971 crew cab. And I've been lurking on the
list for a couple of weeks. You guys are great.

This will be a daily driver some day after I get it running.

I want to start my project by finding a set of better gates, mine are way
rusted and I was wondering if anyone the list knew of a set. They need not
to be in great shape just ok. My are like swiss cheese. I looked thru the
archives and searched the net with no luck.

Any help would be appreciated.

Dwaine
