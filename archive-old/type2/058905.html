Subject: RE:disappearing exhaust bolts

I can definately relate to this problem. I installed an EMPI exhaust
and I was *seriously* unhappy with the quality (or lack thereof). I
too, had the problem of it rattling loose after less than a hundred
miles. This was further aggravated by the fact that it occurred on a
roadtrip and several of the cheap-ass bolts broke when I tried to
tighten them!

At the end of the trip, after many attempts to seel the many leaks, I
switched to an S&amp;S header and it hasn't leaked yet in over 2,000 miles.

If you look at the mating surfaces of an EMPI, you'll see that they
are FAR from square; therefore, you are asking too much of the cheap
bolts and even cheaper gaskets.

Lesson learned: Don't skimp. Buy QUALITY stuff the FIRST time and save
yourself headaches down the road. It was only a $45.00 diferrence and
it was more than worth it.

Of the many EMPI products I have tried, ALL have boken or not even
worked in the first place; yet they always give you EMPI stickers for
your window. Yeah, I really want to tell the world I'm an idiot! I'd
sooner put a FORD sticker back there!!!!!


Just remember, ya gets what ya pays for.
