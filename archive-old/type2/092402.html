Subject: Re: [T2] died half way on trip

Jason, check and double check the fuel pump pushrod length.  My old 73 did
the same thing and I thought it had ghosts in it.  As I recall, VW later
came out with a new pushrod for the type IV engine that did not wear out as
fast...built out of different material.  Greg

&gt;Well it died in Indiana so I jumped a wire from the battery to the coil and 
&gt;it ran fine until I reached my friends house in Springfield Illinois. Well 
&gt;within 5 min. of it anyway. This time it would not start. So we unhooked the 
&gt;gas line before the fuel filter he watched well I turned the key. No Fuel.
&gt;again. No fuel.
&gt;We towed it to his place.
&gt;Tried it again and fuel poured out.
&gt;
&gt;So do fuel pumps work speradicly sometimes on there way out?
