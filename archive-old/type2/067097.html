Subject: Chinese type-2's

Howdys.

They just showed us this Nova video in my epidemiology class on Chinese
esophogeal cancer, and I caught a glimpse (a very brief glimpse, mind you,
I was kind of dozing) of a thing which looked almost exactly, but not
quite, unlike a type 2.  No, no, just kidding, apologies to Douglas Adams.
But it wasn't a VW, I don't think, but looked very much like a bay-window.
Anyone know any more?  Might be an interesting conversation piece.

Also in interesting news:  I think it a fair statement that the Corvair was
an attempt by GM to emulate the bug, right?  Anyway, they didn't stop at
the bug.  Did you know there is an air-cooled, small van/bus thing called a
Corvair something or other?  A very bizarre vehicle indeed.

Just meaningless chatter,
Eric
