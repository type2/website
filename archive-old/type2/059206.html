Subject: Dune Trip Report (pt1): Little Sahara, OK (Epic)
Content-Disposition: inline

Happy Tuesday all,
        
        For those who arent familiar with my &quot;Dune Trip Reports&quot;, I will
fill you in.  I am a true die-hard V-dubber.  I was first introduced to
V-dubs via an obsession with off-roading in the sand dunes of Little
Sahara, OK.  I matured to the Sand Rail level after a couple of years and
was getting sick of the &quot;tent thing&quot; so I got to thinking....why not get a
classic Vw &quot;Bus&quot; and set it up as a camper.  Almost all the parts are
interchangeable with my buggy and cheap.   I could build a light weight
trailer and tow my Rail behind.   Little did I know how good of an idea
this would turn out to be.  I have been doing the Vw bus/rail combo for a
little over two years now.  So far, I have convinced two of my other best
&quot;Dune buddies&quot; to follow this idea and have tons of folks interested. Here
is a little pic:

        This past weekend began with me taking some vacation time off from
work to get the bus and buggy ready to go.  The Thursday preceding, I
rotated my spring plates, replaced my axle boots, and put together my &quot;new&quot;
set of used rear aluminum wheels and paddle 14.50's.  My old steel ones
recieved a fresh coat of chrome paint to be passed off to some new owners
over the weekend at the dunes.  (Boring FYI Stuff:  Weight differences in
rear steel vs aluminum w/ tire was 30lb vs 45lb each).

        I was really looking forward to this trip following a good bus
buddy of mine setting up my dual carbs (Kadron 40's) for me the weekend
before.  Rob Dahlgren  had picked up one of those handy GENE BERG (may he
RIP) tech manuals that talk about setting up aftermarket parts properly for
V-dubs.  Rob is a chemist and had out his tubes and beakers and stuff and
educated me on the fact that my carbs were supposed to be pumping out
between 4/10ths and 8/10ths of a CC of gas per side.  An initial
measurement indicated one carb was doing 1/10th of a CC and the other was
pumping about 3/10ths.  WTF?  These are pretty new carbs.  Well, I guess
this answers the question, &quot;Do they come set up properly out of the box?&quot; 
Anyway, Rob got em set up running sweet. (Boring FYI Stuff:  We set the
carbs at 6/10s of a CC per side....moderation....1641ccDP).

        OK....on to the report.  The wifey and I left out of North Central
Oklahoma around 9pm headed West (app. 100miles) to the dunes.  Keep in
mind, this is the day that my home city, Ponca City, hit the news
nationally with about 7+inches of rainfall overnight.  Needless to say....I
had everything waterproofed for the trip and was planning on rain.  A very
comfortable 65 degrees and a slight mist allowed me to cruise between 60
and 65 mph.  I never went over 210 degrees (oil temp).  I could have went a
little faster but my trailer hitch &quot;apparatus&quot; was getting a little flimsy
on me and paranoid video clips of a twisted buggy kept running thru my
little brain.  The wifey only had to pee 4 times (she drinks...I drive) so
we made the trip reasonably well at 11:15pm.  

        Most everyone else of our group was scheduled to show up the day
following so my first order of business was not to unload, but to simply
find a quiet place to park the bus for sleeping later and go find a party. 
Well, as usual, the Great Bend, KS group (very well known if youve ever
been to Sahara) had some great tunes jamming and beer was plentiful.  We
sat up with them unitl a modest (for me, especially) 12:45am.  Hey.....I
had to reserve myself for the next night when everyone was there.....I AM
getting old.....  I fought the wifey to bed promising that she &quot;would thank
me tomorrow&quot;.

        I awoke extremely early (especially for me) feeling very well
rested.  One of my good buddies, George Allen (Weber44_at_aol_dot_com), hasnt got
his bus together yet and is still doing the &quot;truck cab thing&quot; so he is
usually up at the butt crack O' dawn.  I suspected that I might beat him on
being up the earliest today.  Well, I made the diving mask with my hands
and pushed up against his truck window to see all his bed clothes neatly
folded in his passenger seat.  I smiled to myself thinking about how it
must really suck to camp in anything that you cant stretch out in.  Georges
'65 Westfalia is gonna be a real beauty when he gets it done.  He is a
&quot;Body Guy&quot; so you know its going to be sweet.  George is a
&quot;Coffee-kinda-guy&quot; so I started walking towards the &quot;Oasis&quot; (gas station)
to either find him getting coffee or pick him some up.  I met him halfway
and we walked the rest of the way together for a refill and a &quot;stinky&quot;
break.  Mornings are beautiful......

More coming.......Josh
