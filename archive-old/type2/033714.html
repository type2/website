First I wrote:

&gt;&gt; Also--since I can't read Dutch--what on earth is the phrase &quot;playboy
&gt;&gt; van&quot; doing in the middle of Paragraph 4??

Then Vincent wrote: 

&gt;Before you get the wrong idea, this article really isn't that
&gt;interesting to translate it completely. The Dutch word 'van' means
&gt;'from' in English. It has nothing to do with a VW bus. An old policeman
&gt;is telling about the old-days. He remembers that the Porsche-driving
&gt;police officers were the Playboys of the police department. They felt
&gt;they were better than the rest. (Todays the motorcycle-cops have taken
&gt;thier place in that perspective)        

Drat--it was a MUCH better story the way I was imagining it!  But thanks
anyway, Vincent. 

slightly disappointed,

Portland OR USA
1970 bus--not a &quot;Playboy&quot; anything, really
