&gt; Well, after a crazy year and the birth of my first child (it's a girl!),

congratulations, the fun now begins (5 daughters, last just left

&gt; I've finally managed to find some time to replace the head in my ailing
&gt; '79 Westy.  I've been reading through everything I can get my hands on,
&gt; including list archives, but it has been hard searching all the old posts.
&gt; Although I feel comfortable doing the job, this will be the first time
&gt; I've pulled the engine to do this kind of work and the entire path is not
&gt; clear yet...

1.  decide weather you are putting the bus back on the road or doing a
full rebuild.
2.  how much time do you have, how much money 

&gt; Basically, the story is this: #3 intake valve seat is collapsed and now
&gt; ol' Dandy needs a new head. 

. will the engine still turn all the way through by hand, two complete
revolutions??
. did the seat collapse catastropically, ie at speed..?
. what kind of shape is the rest of the engine in ?

&gt; The folks at Griffin Motorwerks here in Berkeley
&gt; recommended that that I replace BOTH the heads (using new ones from AMC -
&gt; $$$), install a Melling oil pump, put in new lifters, and replace pistons
&gt; and cylinders.  Now, I don't want to do a half-ass job and am not afraid
&gt; to spend a little extra money to make my engine last...  Still, I don't
&gt; want this project to drag on for more than a month.

of course they want you to buyy two heads, their in business to make
money, hopefully by giving good service. BUT

if you have good oil presure now, (put in a guage if you don't have
one) why do you need a new oil pump, and yes I put a new Melling in mine
when I rebuilt it....
if you don't have the tools and some experience expect this to take more
than a month and cost more than $2,000....(remember every job takes longer
than planned and costs more than budget)

&gt; So it all boils down to: how much should I do and what parts do I really
&gt; need to get?  I realize there is no right answer and there is a wide
&gt; spectrum of what I COULD do here.  Some specifics: Does it help to replace
&gt; BOTH heads at the same time?  (I'm reading 110 PSI compression for all

it helps but isn't necesary especially with good compression readings.

&gt; except #3, where compression is 0.)  How do I tell a quality head?  A
&gt; nearby FLAPS in Albany (Small Car World) has Brazillian heads for $140,
&gt; Bus Depot sells heads for $190, and I'm told that new AMC's will run about
&gt; $450 each!  What should I be looking for?  Also, do I need to replace all

THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS NEW, there are some assembled from new castings
but these are few and far between.  the Bus Depot heads are decent and
about average price for a decent type 4 head, the Brazillian heads are
type 1 heads I thinkk and won't fit a 79 

&gt; the valves, or does a rebuilt head already have new ones installed?

usually the valves and springs are included and installed
&gt; 
&gt; As for pistons and cylinders, how do I tell if these need replacing?  Is
&gt; it worth getting new ones?  Can they be remachined?

with 110lb of compression I doubt they need replacing and I wouldn't get
new ones unless you are doing a full rebuild or one is damaged.

&gt; Any last words of advice?  I plan to replace all the fuel lines (I've
&gt; learned at least that much from the list) and check the clutch plate for
&gt; wear while I'm at it.

unless you are having or suspect other problems I would just pick up a Bus
Depot or equivalent head and swap that in, and yes with difficulty they
can be changed without taking the engine out, but taking the engine out is
probably easier if you can do it, remember the type IV engine Is HEAVY.

&gt; Thank you all!  While I've done a lot of work on this bus (including
&gt; removing the gas tank while on the road to remove gunk obstructing the
&gt; fuel line), this is by far the most ambitious thing I've ever done.  My
&gt; wife, daughter, stepson, and I are looking forward to some Westycampin'
&gt; really soon!

if you want to camp real soon, just replace the head...pandora's box (the
case) can be opened later....don't even try this job without a torque
wrench!!!

good luck
Bob
