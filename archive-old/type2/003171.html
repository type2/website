I've had the same problem with the 1600 single port van engine. The original
van generator was longer than the beetle generator. I had to swap a beetle
one into my 71 Westy when the bearings melted out of it on the road. It
worked, but the belt was at an interesting angle.  It never fell off, worked
fine, just looked bad.
.
I have a trike now with the same 1600 single port engine(with the rear
mounting holes). It has an alternator I put on it, and the belt lines up
perfectly. I just looked it over carefully, and not sure what to tell you. I
used the stock tins. Maybe you should try your stock backing plate sheet
metal from the generator, sometimes that aftermarket stuff doesn't fit
right.
