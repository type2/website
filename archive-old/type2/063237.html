Re sealing the gap around pedal shafts:

I remember that I had a BIG gap around the clutch pedal shaft- from below,
wrap Alot of turns of duct tape just where it would hit the floor pan when
it comes up- this forms a seal that forms itself if you do it tight, and
seals the pedal.  Other tricks are to get rubber from old inner truck tube
or a sheet of gasket rubber, and cut a circle for the shaft and a slot to
get it around, then contact cement the thing to the floor around the pedal...
