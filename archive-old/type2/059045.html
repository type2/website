Subject: Hints for buying a bus unseen
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I am trying to find a 1971 bus or Westy. I am currently looking all over the
country. Has anyone bought a bus without seeing it? Any tips on how to
handle the transaction as far as money and title or checking out the vehicle
are concerned. My last attempt at buying a bus in AZ. fell through and ended
up costing me many $. Any hints, help, suggestions, or advice would be
greatly appreciated. TIA TBear
