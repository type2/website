Can you say HOT?  If you can say &quot;hot,&quot; then it's not hot!  If however you
find yourself gasping for air, sweating like the proverbial pig, suffering
hallucinations, and wondering which day of the week it is then you my friend
know what HOT is!  At this point you can't even say the word &quot;hot.&quot;  Kansas
it hot and the Colorado high plains are hot! 

My family and I left from Springfield, Missouri last Sunday morning headed
to Buena Vista, Colorado.  For several years I have teased the weather gods
and travel the first week of July to Colorado for a little whitewater
kayaking.  Every year it's a little warm, but never unbearable.  This year
my luck ran out.  The trip out was fine and fairly uneventful.  The water
was great and the snow in Cottonwood Pass provided a refreshing break.  My
auto transmission fuel injected bus went up the mountain fine, but at the
top it wouldn't start at 12,000 feet so I coasted about 10 miles and 4,000
feet of elevation off the mountain to get started again.  After several days
of camping and boating we decided it was getting too hot and bothersome in
the mountains so we packed up and headed back to Mizzou.  This is where it
got ugly.  The bus ran hot (260 degrees) even driving DOWN 3,000 feet from
Buena Vista to Canon City, home of the Royal Gorge.  Canon City was 101
degrees at 3:00 PM so we decided to stop, eat lunch, and wait for it to cool
down.  It cooled down to about 95 in Canon City so we took off to Pueblo
about 35 miles of rolling hills away.  Bus was still hot so we stopped in
Pueblo (103 degrees) and hung around the mall until about 8:00 PM.  It
cooled down to about 92 so we headed east toward Kansas.  Bus ran around 240
all the way to Wichita where I finally had to stop and sleep at 2:00 AM.
Woke up at 7:00 AM and frantically tried to get on the road before it got
too hot.  Grabbed a newspaper and some pancakes at McDonalds and the paper
said another 100+ day was expected with heat index near 110 degrees!  We
only had 250 miles to go so off we went.  Bus ran about 240 until 11:00 AM
when the temp climbed into the 90s and the bus went up to 240-250.  The last
100 miles home the bus ran around 260 when the outside temp hit the upper
90s.  Got home at 3:30 PM took a shower and crashed for a couple of hours in
the luxury of air conditioning.  

I hope to check the compression and change the oil in my bus during the next
week or so.  I rebuilt the engine in my bus about 3,500 miles before this
trip so it will be interesting to see if any damage is done when traveling
for extended periods of time at 260 degrees.  I didn't have a lot of choice
on the trip and I rarely run over 230.  We were pulling a small trailer with
bikes and boats which made matters worse.   All total, I estimate I drove
500 miles at temps of 260 or so and a few times the bus went all the way to
270-280, but I would pull over immediately and let it idle until it cooled
down (if you call 260 cooled down).  The bus ran strong all the way and I
started it up before I left for work this morning.  It was idling fine and
sounds fine.  I hope everything is OK, but a compression test should tell
more accurately.  I've learned my lesson and I will ever try that again.
Not all is bad because now my wife is riding my a-double-s to get a new
Eurovan camper.  The heat must have really got to her.  Our 16 month old
daughter was smiles all the way.  Life is good.
