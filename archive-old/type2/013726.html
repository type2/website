Subject: Re: [T2] Anybody ever make a set of wheel ramps for a bus?

Don't try to use two sets of ramps, its dangerous.
Use one set of ramps under the non-powered wheels and use a floor jack to
lift the rear wheels and either put suitable blocks of wood under them or
use good quality jackstands under the frame.
The guy that makes cheap car ramps and cheap jackstands lives in China,
he isn't concerned about your safety but all us list members are.
