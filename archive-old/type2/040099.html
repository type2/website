There is an option.  Its a small catalytic converter that sits atop the 1lb
propane bottles.  It works for 8-12 hours at 3K btu.  It's profile is
flatter to the ground and less liable to tipping.  With camping season
coming up it up to 49.00 at the local Wali-land.  Not hard to spot, just
cant remember the name.  I have one on layamyway plan.

More bus then money

&gt; Well, I know it's the wrong season to bring this up, but I just ran across
&gt; what looks like the perfect portable propane heater for our busses. Go to
&gt; www.mrheater_dot_com The unit is called the &quot;Buddy&quot;, small, portable and safe
for
&gt; indoor use, (they say it was designed for use in tents and RV's, ect.)
puts
&gt; out 4000-9000btu's, runs on a 1lb cylinder, or can be hooked into a 20lb
&gt; bottle with an adaptor. Has an oxygen depletion/CO2 auto cut-off, and
sells
&gt; for about $100.00 I'm gonna order one when they become available, which
&gt; should be in Aug. Please check it out!
