&gt; Hi all,
&gt; I'm looking for help with an electrical problem on our 71 westy.
&gt; When we use the turn signals, left or right, the exterior lights work 
&gt; properly but both lights on the dash blink.  Things appear to be
wired 
&gt; correctly.  Is this normal for this year?  Any and all suggestions
welcome 
&gt; as I'm tired of laying on my back and tracing wires under the dash.

The two bulbs are wired together and should flash together.  This was
standard in VWs for years.
