Subject: Help w/friend's '74 (misfiring?)

Borrowed a friend's '74 Westy last night to get home from band practice (since
Sunshine (my '64 westy) is down with ailing heads) and noticed several things. 
Hard starting when hot (acts flooded or rich to me), popping out exhaust at
idle, occasional popping (misfiring?) at low RPM's that can be felt as a bucking
motion, when accelerating away from a stop, will sometimes lose power, and
finally sometimes dies when coming to a stop.

Brought my timing light and dwell tach with me to work this morning and did a
quick check.  Dwell=60 degrees, timing at idle with vacuum hoses attached is
about 16 ATDC, timing at total advance is about 26 BTDC.  Unlike my old upright
fan engine that has excessive crankshaft end play and 40,000 miles on it, but
rock steady dynamic (strobe) timing, the timing on this relatively recently
rebuilt type IV engine seems to hunt.  Maybe it's the vacuum stuff that results
in the hunting, as mine has an 009.  I then looked in his Bentley and Muir books
and they said timing should be about 10 ATDC with hoses attached, and dwell for
old points could be as high as 58 degrees.   Final notes, he recently had this
thing smogged and said the shop told him they had a dickens of a time getting it
to pass, also after passing he passed smog, he removed the belt from the air
pump to try and preserve it till the next smog test.

My friend is not really mechanically inclined, so he is at the mercy of repair
shops when it comes to vehicle maintenance.  He did take the first step and buy
the right manuals and keeps them in the bus, but I think I got them dirtier this
morning than they had gotten in the two years he's had them.

Here is my impressions, anyone out there think I am full of it?
Dwell is way to high, should be more like 45 degrees, so need to reduce point
gap.
Timing is too far retarded, but reducing dwell might bring it into spec, if not
should be set to 10 ATDC with strobe and hoses attached, after insuring the
RPM's are correct.
I don't think not running the air pump could be causing any problem, but in
reviewing Bentley, I noticed two things, the check valve and the anti-backfire
idle mixture valve.  Is there any way to check these things out or disable them
so they don't interfere with normal engine operation.  Normally, I am a firm
believer in the pollution gear, but this system, being only found on the '74 (I
believe), and designed to pump air into the exhaust to burn the unused gasses as
they leave the cylinders seems like a real band-aid to me.  I think a properly
tuned and operating engine should be running clean enough that the exhaust
gasses should be predominantly used up fuel/air mixture, leaving nothing to burn
in the exhaust; additionally, since the air pump is nigh impossible to get, but
is required to pass smog, anything to increase its lifespan seems worhwhile.
I feel like it is running too rich (smells that way too), but those dual carbs
can be a problem getting them matched.  Assuming they are currently balanced, it
looks like Muir says you can just go ahead and perform the idle air bypass screw
adjustment.  Any precautions here?  What if the shop consisted of a bunch of
dufousses (sp?) with all left thumbs and no uni-syn, what dangers are lurking
for an unbalanced carb situation?

Sorry to be so wordy, but I believe that this should be an easily solve problem.

TIA,
terry
