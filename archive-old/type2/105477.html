Subject: Re: [T2] windshield seal

Rob,

Seals are readily available to accept the chrome trim.

New is available.
West coast metric or wolfsburg west forthe seals and chrome.

I had mine done locally(i have done it myself), by an &quot;old&quot; glass 
installer who knew how to do it.....even he moaned about how hard it was 
to keep the chrome strip in while installing.

The local guys will want to use &quot;their&quot; brand of seals...the one my guy 
used looks great...we will see in a few years how it compares to the west 
coast metric seals that I used every place else.  It was labeled 
&quot;Premier&quot;.

Seals with the slot for the chrome are about 3 times the price of no
slot seals.  Depends on what you want your bus to look like.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi:
&gt; 
&gt; Its time for me to replace the windshield seal on my 79 bus. The old 
&gt; seal has a chrome strip &quot;embedded&quot; in it. The chrome strip is in pretty 
&gt; rough shape, but I suppose I'd like to reinstall it if I can. Is it 
&gt; generally the practice to reinstall the strip, or do most people 
&gt; dispense with it.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, does anyone know of a source for good quality seals that will 
&gt; accept the strip? Any special advice relating to installation of the 
&gt; seal with the chrome strip in it?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.
