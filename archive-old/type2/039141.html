AJ:
    The electromagnetic cut-off jet (besides having a very cool name) is to
prevent the engine from running on after the engine is turned off. It is
basically an electronically controlled plunger which goes in and prevents
gas from going into the jet when the engine is turned off, thereby
preventing run-on. The bad thing is if the wire is disconnected or the thing
is broken the jet will be plugged and the engine won't idle. If you don't
mind run-on it is probably unnecessary to fix it but why keep it the way it
was designed?
I hope I'm right,

&gt; Actually, this is exactly the thing I wanted to bring up. I rebuilt my
carb
&gt; last night and found the flared end (nipple) of the electromagnetic cutoff
&gt; valve has been snipped off by someone before me. What does this thing do?
&gt; What would be caused by it not being fully functional and will it mess up
my
&gt; project of setting idle/mix, rpm and timing this weekend if i do not yet
&gt; have a replacement?
