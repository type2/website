Subject: mixing octane?
Message-ID: &lt;0.c776db09.253d6220_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I got a quick simple question about fuel octane.
  when your tank is half full of 87, and you add the other half full with 89, 
does it all mix and make 88, or will the gas have a natural tendencie to stay 
seperate?
           I'm just wondering this because when i left the east coast, i was 
useing 89, but with a money shortage in Wyoming where there were different 
octanes for higher prices, i would sometimes use 85.5 to get me along, and 91 
at the next reasonable station.
