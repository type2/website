Subject: Re: [T2] RE: [VB] Totaled Bay

Now, I am truly impressed.. This is very similar overall to pictures of bus
called, &quot;The Frog&quot; (pics online) that hit a cow down in Mexico on a surfing
safari.
Both vehicles did very well, considering that both drivers walked away from
it, plus the following...
Recently there was an accident on local freeways in S. Calif. in which a
horse came out of the back of it's trailer (not latched properly?) while
going about 60-65 MPH (guessing) and hit the vehicle behind it, same lane.
The horse went over the hood (to be expected) and took off the top of the
sedan, AND the driver's head.. Yup.. A headless man/horse mess.
I have frequently worried to myself that there is not much up front of us as
our four cylinders hurtle us down the highway, but at least we are up high
enough that we are somewhat protected from roving ungulates.
As for following a horse trailer, well.. There are always the other lanes,
no?   Jan B
