Hey All,
   Returned home around 12:30 pm today from the (official?) Mid-Atlantic area
winter campout. Turnout was small, 5 Westys total, and even though it was cold
Friday night and rained on us this morning, it was still a good time. Hey, you
cant have a bad time when you're with VW folks, the best in the world. For
those who are unsure of camping in their Westys in the winter, a small
electric heater keeps it quite comfortable. A porta-potti eliminated the need
for a 4 am trip to the bath house ( 18 degrees out!). Many thanks to Drew for
getting us all together, lets do it again next year!!   Now for the tech
question. When I woke this morning to find rain I knew my '76 Westy ( 1.8 with
a single Weber) was'nt going to be happy. It does not like cold, damp weather.
On the way home it stalled a couple of times, while rolling, so I just hit key
and popped the clutch and she fired right up. After a stop for breakfast,
seemed like the battery was dead. Turn the key and my voltmeter showed 10V,
not enough to turn her over. Another rolling start, and I'm on my way. I
arrived home, parked behind my company car. Go out about 6pm, won't start,
still showing 10V. Get  out my portable gell cell battery with jumper cable
leads, hook it up, it fires up. I disconnnect the portable batt., and it idles
like crap, have to keep feathering the throttle to keep her running. Needle on
voltmeter is jumping wildly. I miss hitting the gas, she stalls. Hook the
battery up again, start it, but this time leave the portable battery hooked
up. Idles smooth as silk. Voltmeter shows a steady 13.8 volts. I would assume
I have a bad battery, but if I do its the 3rd one in a little over a year. At
a steady cruise, 55- 60 mph, my volmeter shows about 13.8, steady needle. Its
at idle it jumps around. Things I do know: Battery is 5 months old, belt is
tight, connections at the battery are clean and tight, gnd. strap from axle to
trans is there, good and tight. Don't know: condition of connections at
alternator,
voltage reg., or starter. I've heard of people getting more than one defective
battery, but I have a hard time thinking I've gotten 3 over the past year. Any
other ideas? Thanks, and lets shoot for a better turnout at next years winter
campout! In Key West, maybe?       Thanks, Jeff S.
