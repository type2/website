Hi volks,

&gt; Whenever anyone says to me that they are
considering a new car, I ask if they are averaging
&gt; more than $3600 in repair costs over the last year.
&gt; Figure your *minimum* new car payments at
$300/month and multiply by 12.

 I like to look at it as a gamble- Buy a new car and you _know_ you're going to be out a few grand each year for depreciation etc. Buy an old car and you _might_ have to blow it on repairs.
 Each year you get through with no major repairwork wins you several thousand quid.

 Then you tradeoff character and utility for comfort and convenience...

Cheers,
