&gt; I bought a pair of those sliding windows for the mid-section (sliding
&gt; door and the opposite fixed wall), and it really REALLY helps open up
&gt; the inside of the Bus. it makes it feel more &quot;open&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; However, first thing is, it sounds like the sliding window is installed
&gt; incorrectly. It SHOULD be installed so that the outter most pane (of the
&gt; two) is closest towards the front of the Bus). This is because, unless
&gt; you drive backwards a lot, you don't want wind or rain to be going in
&gt; between two panels. For example, the forward most window pane of the
&gt; slider should be overlapping the rear-most window panel from the
&gt; outside. Otherwise you're &quot;catching&quot; wind and rain so to speak. The
&gt; slider knobs should BOTH be on the INSIDE. There is one that's meant for
&gt; the left side, and one that's meant for the right side.

unfortunatley I only have one slider, and it is for the  left side, which
is where I wanted to put it.  but the slider is the one that needs to get
replaced now...

&gt; Don't quote me on this, but I DO believe they sell SOLID pieces for
&gt; those mid-section windows. I BELIEVE that I may actually have one too.
&gt; I'm not totally sure, but I'll check. If I have it, you're more than
&gt; welcome to have it for the cost of shipping. (I even have the gasket for
&gt; it).


that is what I was originally looking for,  I never open the window on the
slider.  would love to have it, where are you located.???  or at least a
tracing of it so I can have one made locally

&gt; Your OTHER alternatives for that windowed area is to install jalosey
&gt; windows (did I spell that right?). As you know, those are the ones where

gave away two of those. don't like em.

&gt; There is also the &quot;standard&quot; window option which is the SMALL vent
&gt; window which I believe is no larger than 1/4 the size of the entire
&gt; window. I'm not really a big fan of these, but I think they work well in


well I will have the set that I take out if anyone is interested, until I
get it out i can't give much of an idea of condition but the solid glass
part is good.

&gt; I'd recommend having some sort of window there... especially since you
&gt; have the sliding glass already... the Bus doesn't have a whole lot of
&gt; air flowing through it with the smaller windows (or no openable
&gt; windows).

true,  I've thought of putting a solid panel in the rearmost windows but
way down on the &quot;round tuit&quot; list.
