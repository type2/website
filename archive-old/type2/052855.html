Subject: RE: blues on carb

I have similar problems. I just finished rebuilding my carb a few weeks ago,
never had starting problems till now. VERY hard to start but runs great once
warm. Sometimes I am worried I will kill the battery trying so hard to get
him to crank. It takes continuous pumping of accelerator pedal to get him to
crank.
The carb was in good shape, I replaced the seals and cleaned the float bowl
and blew compressed air through jets. Any ideas? Or have I made a mistake in
the rebuilding process? Someone suggested that only 1/2 of the rebuild jobs
ever come out ok and that I buy a new carb.

&gt;i would recommend
&gt; going to the local flaps and buying a rebuild kit for
&gt; your carb.
