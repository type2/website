Subject: Flywheel cleaning &amp; starter bushing

Greetings,

'79 2.0L FI Westy

What should I use to clean my flywheel? Brake cleaner? How do I know if it 
needs machining? It has been about 55k since it was last machined and 
balanced.

Also, it has been a long time since I replaced the starter bushing. How do I 
do this? I remember it ibeing easy. Do I just drive it out with something? 
Seems like I remember soaking the new one in oil? before I installed it.

Thanks,
Brandt
