&gt; guess it depends on if you can get a piece of tempered glass the right
&gt; size and if you know how to install it...the sliding windows are getting
&gt; kinda &quot;desirable&quot; and beginning to become rare so it might be cost
&gt; effective to get it fixed, or at least put a piece of Lexan in the spot
&gt; for the time being

   Don't know if this will help, but some of the more chronologically
challenged lists I'm on recommend a glass shop that carries &quot;school
bus&quot; glass...Flat sheets of glass that the shop can cut to size for you...
Might help... ?-)
