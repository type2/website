Subject: Re: [T2] Quick help needed with wipers

Guys,

78 Champagne edition with intermittent wipers.

Just went thru this last Saturday.  Turns out that my wipers just got 
slower and slower and then just stopped.  When i restored the bus, I spent 
a lot of time on the wipers, relubing, checking the motor and contacts and 
testing...

When the wipers got really slow, the intermittent relay started buzzing as 
well....

Turns out, all I had to do was pull the connector off of the motor and 
then put it back on...worked like a champ then.  Next time I am up under 
the dash, I will clean the contacts all again.

Important point...when you have the switch unplugged from the harness, and 
turn the key on, my wipers start to run...


The switch(which I had out as well) does look like a perfect candidate for 
a small micro switch that would run an electric washer pump.  it is on my 
list for the near future as I alread have a universal pump from the local 
FLAPS that will work on it.

Richard, my original switch look like yours and does run the wipers for 
about 4 wipes...maybe part of the intermittent wiper stuff that came std 
on the Champagne edition?

BTW!  Does any one have, or can the give me a reference to a wiring 
diagram that shows the intermittent wiper relay?  I *have* bentley, but 
could not find the relay info, even in the 79 wiring section...did I miss 
it?

Cheers, dave

&gt; All of this wiring talk and today's first rainfall in months got me
&gt; interested in the replacement switch I've been sitting on. This is the
&gt; original switch:

&gt; 
&gt; Noticing too many wires? So did I. I can't find red/black and brown in the
&gt; wiring diagram and look...there's an extra contact:
&gt; 
&gt; http://homepage.mac_dot_com/ratwell/.Pictures/MoreParts8/42-WasherContact.jpg
&gt; 
&gt; I'm at a bit of a loss to explain this change but it would appear to be a
&gt; contact to turn on the wipers automatically when you activate the washer. I
&gt; need to check the connector in the steering column to see if it still fits
&gt; but I suspect the extra wiring to the wiper motor will be missing unless it
&gt; was jumpered at the column connector.
&gt; 
&gt; What's exciting about this is that the switch could easily to used to power
&gt; a pump to wash the windshield.
