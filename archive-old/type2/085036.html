Subject: Re: [T2] CHT installation

Dolan writ:
&gt;The ideal oil temperature for an air-cooled VW engine is about 210-220
degrees fahrenheit&lt;


That is too high from my experiences.  I like my oil in the 180-210 range.
Even at 210 it violates the &quot;cannot hold the dipstick for 3 seconds&quot; rule.

This is for a T1 engine though.  The T4 may have a different temperature
range that they like.  I know a lot of 914 guys regularly see 240-250 which
is &quot;too damn hot&quot; according to Bruce Anderson.

Once the engine starts getting hot just slow her down until the temperature
stays where you want it.

Also since summer is coming change to an appropriate viscosity oil.  I like
HD30, but some people go HD40 or even HD50 in really hot places.

From what I understand the CHT should stay below 350F as a normal range.
But do not quote me on that.
