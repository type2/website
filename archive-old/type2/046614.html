Subject: [T2] Beginner Valve Job Woes

    This may be a very stupid question, but this is only the 2nd time I have
done a valve adjustment on my own, and I am trying to figure out if I have a
BIG problem, or something silly I overlooked.
    I retorqued my heads this morning, and proceeded to do a valve
adjustment. Everything went fine until I tried to do the intake on Cylinder
3. I can not get ANY gauge through it, even with the screw backed completely
out. I turned the engine again to make sure #3 was at fire, still can not
budge any feeler blade through.
    I have spent the last hour in the archive, but still am not sure if
there is something else I can try...or am I looking at engine work now?
    This is a real bummer with a local bus campout only a week away...
    Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated!
    Oh yeah, its the '70 I am working on currently. (has 1600 dual port, no
modifications)
