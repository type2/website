Subject: [T2] RM2193 Revisited

Continuation of an earlier thread about installing a
Refrigerator into a T2.  More specifically, the
Domenic RM2193 upgrade for ASI/Rivieras.  Have been
responding to some 1-on-1 requests for more info.  Am
now going to repeat most for T2 listers benefit.  (I
also feel guilty about describing the benefits of the
RM2193 without thoroughly discussing the drawbacks.)
     
I can't speak for Westies, but the ASI/Riviera's old
refrigerators seldom operate after 30 years of use. 
My ASI/Riviera fridge was DOA dead on arrival.  The RV
world has some solutions.  After some research, my
choice of replacement was a Domenic RM-2193.  But it
is not a perfect fit, and requires some tedious work.
   
First, the Domenic fits the hole for the old reefer,
but needs to be raised 2.5&quot; to 3&quot;.  Second, it runs on
12v (9 amps), 120v, or propane.  A confusing issue in
my E-mail requests is why you can't run 2 or all 3 of
the energy sources?  Well the manufacturer cautions
you not to.  So don't plan on it.  I suspect it would
overheat with 2 or more sources running.  Third, to
make use of the propane energy source, the reefer must
be SEALED to the outside sheet metal, using rubber
boots or tight form-fitting plywood with caulked
seams.  Fourth, both a lower and upper sheet metal
vent must be provided so the considerable heat the
Ammonia-cycle or Absorption-cycle generates, must
breath and exhaust to the out-of-doors year around. 
The owners manual says the lower vent is to vent
leaking Propane, while the upper vent is to exhaust
the heat, and to promote a heat rising air intake
below and exhaust above.  Why all of the tedium about
sealing the refrige against the outside sheet metal? 
The propane flame generates CO / Carbon Monoxide. 
Every attempt must be taken to prevent that CO from
entering the passenger compartment.
    
Can't run propane while driving, and the Propane
should be shut-off during gasoline fill-ups.  The
refridge is from France, is well built.  Shipping
weight is about 50 pounds.  If you have ever tried to
pick-up a refridge of any size, you know they are very
heavy.  At 50#, this is light.  During use, there is
no heavy energy hog compressor.  Instead, the heat
source starts some sort of Ammonia cycle, and the
refridge interior begins to frost-up.  Oh, this RM2193
has a thin door, 2 shelfs, no interior light, and no
door shelves.  No ice maker.  And it only works when
the T2 is level.  It's simplicity seems to mimic that
of the original VW vehicle design: Simplicity!
   
Lastly, this RM2193 keeps food cool.  But don't try
loading it up with warm canned beer, and drive 50
miles expecting the beer to be cold.  Won't be cold. 
What you put into the refridge needs to start cold or
frozen.  After a day, the cold is still cold, and the
frozen is thawing.  And be careful if you have wired
the 12v to the main battery.  At 9 amps draw, it
doesn't take too many hours to drain the main battery,
preventing the engine from turning-over.  The Cadillac
convenience of a real refridge, should be based upon
use of a Cadillac electrical system:  That being an
auxiliary battery, charged from the engines charging
system, with a battery isolator in between.  My AUX
battery is a long &amp; heavy marine deep cycle battery,
and drives a (recently upgraded) 2500 watt inverter,
as well as the refridge.
    
Thermostat, pilot light starter, propane valve, and
12v and 120v switches, are all accessed from outside
of the vehicle.  There are no switches or dials or
adjustments inside the T2.
    
For my install, the Refridge is raised 2.75&quot;.  I plan
on fabricating a thin drawer under the unit to hold
electrical cords, and water hoses.  But I'm not real
handy with wood.  I only get by.
    
Was all the hassle of installing the refridge worth
it?  Yes.  I flip a switch on, load the reefer with
weekend food, including pop, milk, etc.  Then I head
out to camp somewhere.   When I arrive, I switch the
Refridge to 120v if at a park hook-up, or 12v if not,
and relax for 2 or 3 days.  Having this household
convenience makes camping in the T2 way more domestic
and convenient.
