&gt; Hello Listers:
&gt; 
&gt; I've been building a new engine for my 71 Bus, and decided to switch to an alternator.  I ordered one of those alternator conversion kits from a mail-order place that advertises in the VW magazines, and was initially happy with the quality of the parts in the kit.  Over the weekend, I put the fan backing plates(that came with the kit) together with the fan and alternator, then bolted this assembly onto the fan shroud.  Since the engine is on a wheeled rack that sits on the floor, I can stand over the engine and look down at the top of it.  In doing this, I noticed that the pulley on the alternator doesn't line up with the crankshaft pulley.  I fact, it looks like it may be off nearly a half-inch.  Is this acceptable?  I'm afraid the pulley belt will spin off.  So did the vendor I bought the kit from give me the wrong alternator stand?  When I push the alternator as far toward the fan shroud as it will go, it butts up against the alternator stand and leaves that half-inch mis-alignment between the pulleys.  Does anyone know what the fix for this problem is??

Well, I can't speak to your problem, since I sidestepped it when
I bought proper VW parts before installing the aftermarket stuff.  The VW
parts are easily available from wreckers (D&amp;D in Sparks, NV had several in
the bin when I bought mine),  I do note that the alternator is a very
close fit on the stand and there is no room for error on the part of the
stand or tin.  The Chinese stand was different in details from the VW
part, so it's not a direct copy.  My belt lines up perfectly.

I believe that the total cost of the used stand and tin was $28.  Well
worth it, IMHO.
