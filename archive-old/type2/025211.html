Sorry Guys, but it's Friday and I just have to vent. Lately (since
acquiring my 83 Vanagon) I have been spending alot of time at the local
junk yards searching for various parts and what not. It seems that the
local yards have a fair amount of Buses and Vanagons. The problem is that
these things have been worked over by some very inconsiderate previous
scroungers. 

I know that alot of times there is a right way to remove parts, and then
there's the fast way. Want the instrument panel out? Take the time to
remove it right or just rip that sucker out with brute force. I think 90%
of the vehicles I have looked over have been subjected to the Gorilla
Monsoon (GM) method of parts removal. It seems so unnecessary and why is it
that the part I'm looking for is the one that got destroyed in the process.


I know that nobody on the list would resort to the GM method unless it was
the absolute last resort. Just makes me wish that other people would be as
considerate.

Thanks for the bandwidth
