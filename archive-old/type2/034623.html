Subject: Anyone parting out a Vanagon

I need some rust repair pieces from an early vanagon.
I have an '80, so I know that '80-'82 is a no-brainer,
but I think that most of the other years will work.

I need window sill pieces and even a new rear 
hatch, if it is in good shape. Window sill pieces
should be UPSable, they would be small.

I am in Washington, DC, so if you know of any in
nearby yards, I would love to hear from you.
