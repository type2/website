Subject: POR-15 Special

I'm offerring all POR-15 products to T-2 Listmembers at 15% off until the
end of November (Midnight, think of the Pumpkin). The only requirement I
have is that POR-15 orders must total over $50, NOT including shipping
charges.

I also want to thank everyone for their patronage! :-)
