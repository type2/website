&gt;P.S.  for the love of god do not put screws to hold up

Well, I don't know what the uproar is all about.  These are high quality MACHINE screws that just happen to have a phillips head.  If you have enough rust up there that they wouldn't turn with a big-ass (tm) phillips screwdriver, then they will probably have to be drilled out anyway.  I've had those screws in there for over ten years and have never had a problem.  And who puts an impact wrench on a M8 (actually I think it might be M6!) bolt with a 10mm head?  That is just silly IMO.  You have more than enough torque with a large screwdriver to break that pup free.
