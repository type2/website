Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Pumps

Hi Volks,

I'll chip in here and give a first-hand report.

Driving down to EveryBus 2002 we bought some bad fuel in Depew NY. My 
Baywindow Westfakia and Dad's Vanagon Westy were both stricken. My 
repair required only the replacement of a clogged filter and the 
&quot;burping&quot; of the vapor-locked pump, but the blockage in the Vanagon 
filter killed its pump dead as a doornail.

Once we verified that the pump was dead we piled into Collison Corner's 
westy and drove down the road to the nearest town, which was Bath NY. 
Bath had three auto parts stores, the one nearest the highway was an 
AutoZone or Pep-Boys or something like what you usually find in a 
commercial strip-mall. It had lots of blister-packed junk on the walls 
and a pimply kid behind the counter (No offense to pimply-kids, I  was 
one once) who was no help at all, other than to give us the $199 price 
and the news of the 2-day delivery wait.

The next stop was a short ways down the road, to a REAL flaps. (Fred 
Roberts Auto Supply.)The lad at the counter took one look at the part I 
laid down and came back in 15 seconds with a replacement. WOOHOO!!!!   
Too bad it was a coil instead of a fuel pump. LOL! So the counter boy 
introduced me to the guru whose name was on the sign out front, and he 
brought out  a 5-inch-thick paper catalog of fuel system components. He 
was able to look up the vanagon pump and confirm fuel-flow and 
pressure, and offer the part number of a corresponding Ford-equivalent. 
  The inlet diameter was indeed different from the VW part, but this can 
be accommodated by using a ford filter to match the pump. The cost of 
the Ford pump was $119, the VW pump was quoted at $199. Fred didn't 
have one in stock but he called the local NAPA dealer and confirmed 
that they had one, and even gave us directions to get there.

When we got back to the road-side repair site I installed the pump in 
about 10 minutes. It did require some extra connectors to attach the 
wiring and a cable-tie had to be used to mount the larger Ford fuel 
filter. There is a pic of the pump installed here:

&gt;&gt; FWIW, rumor has it that FI Ford trucks use the same pump.  MUCH 
&gt;&gt; cheaper at the boneyard, and MUCH easier to find a lo-mileage FI Ford 
&gt;&gt; pickemup than a low-mileage FI lagwagen.
&gt;
&gt; All you've got to do is find a matching pump that makes the same 
&gt; pressure and volume. I too have heard there is a Ford truck with the 
&gt; same needs.
&gt;
&gt; Most better (pro) auto parts stores (not supermarket FLAPS manned by 
&gt; 17 year olds) have catalogs that show the specs on their parts and 
&gt; should have a page or two of pressure / volume specs on their pumps.
&gt;
&gt; You can cross reference this over to a Ford vehicle and buy from them 
&gt; or a junkyard. Of course be sure to buy SOMETHING from the FLAPS to 
&gt; justify their time with you.... I use the same store (NAPA) and an 
&gt; Advance Auto (used to work there, have friend there, and yes I see it 
&gt; as a supermarket FLAPS) and they don't mind me flipping through their 
&gt; catalogs. Requires none of their time until they have to pull a part 
&gt; for me.
&gt;
&gt; If you do some junkyard shopping be sure to get a bit of the wiring so 
&gt; you can slice that into your VW.
