Subject: Air Cooled Vanagon Won't Start in cold weather

Here in Toronto it is -4C or -10C with the wind chill, I am 
not sure what that is in degrees F but trust me its cold. I 
have been having this problem for a while and today it 
finally gave up. 

I can hear the van turning over but it doesn't &quot;catch&quot;. If I 
keep my foot on the throttle and keek the key turned to 
start the engine almost, but doesn't quite, start. When it 
was slightly warmer the same thing was happening but it 
would eventually start. 

Any ideas?

Thanks,
Chris
