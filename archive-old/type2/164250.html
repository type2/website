Subject: oil temp warnings

Hi,

 

I have one of those thermo electric Burg sensors on my #3 cylinder tin.

 

It did work, once during a 250 KM run on rough roads up North. I was new to
the bus. For all I know, I did the run in 3rd. I used to forget to shift
because the Mackenzie Highway was nuts. If it was not a tractor trailer
showing up around a rock face, it was a deep rut. 

 

It is hooked up to the oil sensor and grounds the oil sensor light to turn
it on.

 

Now, I have understood that if you are driving a bus and want to keep the
engine happy, you should think in terms of moving air by maintaining good
revs for speed, not insane revs, just imagine the engine cooling itself by
keeping it sucking air as you shift up. Lugging is bad.

 

I take 3rd all the way up to 80 Kph, not sustained, just peak to go into 4th
and I either maintain 80, or drive at 100, depending on needs.
