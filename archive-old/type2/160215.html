Subject: Re: type2 Digest 30 Jul 2006 16:00:00 -0000 Issue 6958

Hi Volks,

I am researching an odd starting issue.  On an '82 aircooled FI, it doesn't
like to start cold.  Runs badly, needs a lot of throttle peddle, and tries
to die.  Act like an overfueling issue.  Once warm, it seems to run well.
Have tried disconnecting the cold start injector, but not sure it has made
any difference.

Looking through the archives, but thought I would post this here just in
case.

Thanks,
Burt
