&gt;-get the seal warm

No SUN ? Try the microwave oven for this one.

&gt;-silicone spray on the seal

Roofing tar provides an assembly lubricant and a perpetual sealing material.
Brush into the glass / rubber channel as well as the metal window frame.
It cleans up with mineral spirits or kerosene. It's also cheap. And a popular
favorite over on the vintagebus list .

&gt;as far as 'wire', actually i used some speaker wire split in half. i dont
&gt;know the guage but its not that thick. i used the same type of wire for the
&gt;other seals i installed a few years ago on a 73 super beetle &amp; it worked
&gt;pefectly.

speaker wire won't take much torque. Use weedwhacker nylon line.
