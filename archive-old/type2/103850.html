&gt; &gt; &gt; You can get an adaptor for about $20 that will screw into those big
20 Lb refillable propane tanks. the little 1 Lb throwaway bottle will
screw in to the other end and you can refill them and reuse them. So, hang
on to your throwaway propane cannisters

According to the rules and regs people, this is a big no-no, as in an
offense to transport a refilled disposable bottle.  The problem
is that it is possible to fill the little bottle completely full with
propane, which will result in the container rupturing if it warms up due
to the imcompressable fluid expanding.

To avoid this, give the container a shake after you fill it.  If you don't
feel a good slosh, vent some of the propane back into the big bottle
before the little bottle warms up.  If you're gonna be illegal, at least
be safe!
