&gt; This is, of course, the &quot;pancake&quot; style, and it is suspended by a carrier bar.
&gt; We took this engine out, and were surprised to see that the carrier bar slid
&gt; freely from side to side in the space it occupied beneath the shrouding, etc.
&gt; This does not seem quite right, and I suspect that some bolts have come loose
&gt; and fallen away, but I cannot examine it without pulling off a lot of stuff.

there should be two engine mounts on the carrier bar, they are difficult
to get to but can be changed without disassembling the engine.  Busdepot
has them in their catlog on pg 31 part # 021 199 231C for about $8 each

you should put them in
