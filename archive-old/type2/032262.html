&gt; &gt; 4. Am I wrong, or does the thermostat work opposite of the 1600 and
&gt; &gt; older engines ? It appears from the instructions in the Bentley that the
&gt; &gt; proper adjustment is to close the flaps, pull the actuating wire tight
&gt; &gt; and clamp down the nut. This would mean that we are relying on the
&gt; &gt; thermo to expand and open the flaps and if for some reason it did not,
&gt; &gt; the flaps would remain closed and thus possibly overheat the engine...am
&gt; &gt; I nuts here ?
&gt; 
&gt; Don't know about older engines, but you've described the procedure 
&gt; correctly for the Type IV engine.  Since thermostats fail in the expanded 
&gt; position, the flaps would fail in the open or cooling position, assuming 
&gt; your spring is in place.
&gt;  

I WOULD NOT SET THE THERMOSTAT THE WAY THE BENTELY SUGGESTS!

see my post EARLIER today about my problem, namely that the total travel
of the thermostat must be as specified in the bently manual, or else
setting it this way will not allow the flaps to open all the way.  I would
suggest running you engine until the thermostat is hot and fully expanded
and then setting that to corrospond to the full open condition (ie pull
the wire tight and tighten the connection with flaps open and thermostat
hot). Then as it cools it will close the flaps however much it can close
them giving you the error on the side of too much cooling rather than too
little.  Or else just measure the dimention 'a' as shown in the bentely
manual, and if yours doesn't match spec then replace the themostat.

Hope this helps!
