Subject: Re: Vanagon Crew Cab

Single Cabs and Crew Cabs were (and are still) available from the 50s
on. You even see plenty of Eurovan Crew Cabs all over Europe. US
importation regulations just killed them on the US market.

I have been thinking about bringing in Crew Cabs and Single Cabs that
just about make the 25 year requirement. A friend in Germany runs a shop
that specializes in air cooled buses and he usually has one or two late
bay pickups sitting around. I have also asked him to start looking for
very early Vanagon pickups produced in late 79 - US legal in 2004 ...

Listers who are interested can p-mail me at: marcus_at_schaper_dot_com

restoration)
