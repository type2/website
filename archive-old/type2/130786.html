Subject: timing the 009

Hi folks!

This week-end I installed my brand new progressive weber and a 009 
distributor. I am not familiar with timing the bus (my brother in law 
did this job for me!), but I would like to know what is the procedure 
to do so. I looked in the recent timing posts, but I still don't 
understand how to do it and  how it works...

Does anyone has a easy and accurate step-by-step procedure for 009 
timing??!

BTW, my engine is a 1700cc (code cb) with a weber progressive.

Thanks

Marck
