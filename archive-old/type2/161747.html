Subject: RE: [T2] [Q] (Simple) Solenoid Question

&gt;*where* is the starting &gt; solenoid on a '71 Camper?  I believe mine has gone
bad,

When you turn the key on to the first position, do you hear a *click* back
there? If so it's probably ok.

The solenoid is attached to the starter and is the same shape, but alot
smaller. Sometimes they stick when wore out and you can whack them to get them
to work again. Make sure that bolt going through the starter, tranny, and
engine is tight.

-Daniel
