Hello and thank you for writing to us!
I have spoke to our fitment person, the 7&quot; wide wheel will work on your
Transporter. Unfortunately I do not have any printed information to offer 
you. If you have any further questions, please email us again or call one of 
our sales agents at 800-589-6789.
Thank you,
