&gt; I agree, but......

&gt; [not sure about the part about 'more air getting in'
&gt; though. A 34 pict carb flows the same amount of air

This is the interesting properties of Ether, NOS , and any other Oxygen bearing
fuels..... the extra &quot;air&quot; getting into the combustion chamber is in the fuel,
not the manifold system

Water injection makes an interesting thought,, you are putting oxygen into the
combustion chamber, [H2O] effectively raising the compression ratio as water
does not compress,  removing HP from the steam that is created and at basically
the same time,, cooling the gasoline. Too bad the water doesn't burn! 

I am no expert on this stuff,, but I *know* some of the Great American Nascar
and Drag racers used to &quot;dial in&quot; their vehicle as best they could with out
getting caught.
If you open up the carb, or the restrictor plate , manifolds, or heads,, The
tech officials will find the illegal modification,, BUT , if you can get the air
in some other way,,,, Yahoo!

NOS is hard to hide,, ask the Dodge boys where that hood went after every race, 
rumour has it that they had 2 bottles of NOS hidden in the ribs of those
hoods... why were they changing hoods after every race???

Ether was a simple way to &quot;pour&quot; AIR into your fuel,,, you had to add a bit of
lubricant like 2 stroke oil to compensate for the dryness of the ether, and
allow the engine to last any length of time, but that was very hard to detect in
the winners circle..... especially if you ran the car almost completely out of
fuel during the race.
Racers new that they could win... or blow up the engine, depending on how much
ether is in the fuel.... 
How much Ether is a good thing?? 
It certainly depends on the engine, etc. etc. etc.

If you ever hang around a drag race,, you will see they have a weather station
with them,,, and a chemistry lab along with a computer or a casio calculator,,
or a really really dog eared notebook.
They want to know the data exactly,, 

Most serious racing fuels are mixed minutes before a race,...  all dependent on
the atmospheric condition and other fine points
Ambient Temperature, humidity, air pressure, all effect the combustion.... 


Fuel makers have different mixtures [blends] for different climates,,,, The gas
you get in Toronto is Not the same as you get in Montreal, or Vancouver as they
are as different as Maine, Florida and Texas.
I am not talking octane ... but blends of gas and additives  MTBE


*I* don't think that Fuel makers really care about Vw air-cooled at this point,
in fact If they every had discussions with the VW sales reps, or Manufacturing
*I* would expect that Vw would be happy to obsolete the air-cooled cars, and
sell more NEW cars that withstand the new fuel.
If I was selling cars, and a fuel maker indicated they were worried that some of
my 20 - 50 year old car engines design might not withstand the product,,, I
would have to think ,, MORE people in the market for a NEW CAR! yeaaaa!

Fuel mfg.'s and Car mfg.'s do have discussions,,  Vw is not happy with Gas co.
right now,, as their diesel injector pumps do not like the diesel fuels today
specific to different countries.... you can get further off topic and ask what
is happening to the Home heating fuel market,, oil burner mechanics dread the
new fuel in certain circumstances

Not too long ago, a certain fuel maker made the news about an additive that was
adversely effecting Chrysler gas gauges senders..... 
What led to that discovery? ,,,,, A lot of Chryco techs were reporting
failures,, and it was the pumps and gauge senders in the tank,,,, so it didn't
take much to relate the problem to fuel, and ask the customer where they usually
bought fuel. Did the problem go away over night,, nope,, cause they had tons of
additives to get rid of, so they stalled for time with comments &quot;we are looking
in to the problem&quot; 

But, what about the other cars that had failures of a different nature,  
If your 10 year old car overheats,, who suspects the fuel had anything to do
with it??
nope,, they guess everything else and it is customer pays situation,, which
might lead to a decision to sell the old car, and buy a new one due to the cost
of the repairs vs the age of the car,,, 
Totally understandable, and never suspecting that gasoline may have shortened
the life of that generation of engine design.  In fact the owners probably liked
the gas as it made quicker starts, cleaner burning, etc.

What it boils down to is the Manufactures are in a WIN WIN situation as the fuel
co. can get rid of a product by putting it in gasoline, And if you remember a
few years ago,,, they tried to get a &quot;premium&quot; price for the *WINTER* gasolines!
That idea didn't work,, now they use it as a value added bonus 
 The auto mfg.'s don't need a air pump any more, they have less pollution PPM
percentages and a few of the older cars are disintegrating leading to more new
car sales by attrition


Makes me wonder about air-cooled life in Countries that are &quot;improving&quot; their
emissions, Like Mexico.
Isn't Mexico moving toward cleaner environmental conditions?  Maybe that is why
the Tiajuana Taxi is on it's way out?
