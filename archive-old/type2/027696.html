OK.

After work, in the parking lot, the starter/solenoid would NOT kick over.

I ran a wire from the battery, outside, to the ignition wire spade on the 
solenoid (I took the ignition wire off the solenoid).

Nothing...

I put a voltmeter in line with wire, from the battery to the ignition wire 
spade on the solenoid.  The wire actually was a remote starter switch, from 
the battery to the volt meter, and the volt meter to the ignition wire spade 
on the solenoid.  I could push the remote starter button and watch the volt 
meter (digital)


When I pressed the button on the remote starter, I got a reading of 12.7 
volts going to the ignition wire spade on the solenoid.

Nothing...

I push started the VW by hand, as I have done at least ten times before.  It 
started fine.  I got it home.  I parked it on an incline.

Now, after a solid run of 13 miles, it started.  Again I tried, again it 
started (turned over and fired off and ran)

OK, how about some help here!!

Would I be getting 12.7 volt reading if I did not have a good ground??  BTW, 
I have an additional ground wire running from the lower starter bolt to the 
frame, along with previously pulling the ground strap tot eh transmission, 
and cleaning and sanding to bare metal the ground point.  You see, I have 
had this problem for teh past three years.

I had a Ford starter relay about three years back, and after a while (less 
than two years) it failed to kick the starter/solenoid, even though I could 
hear the Ford solenoid kicking in from the driver's seat - doors open.  I 
replaced the Ford relay with a Bosch starter relay last year, and a few 
months back it failed to kick the starter/solenoid.  I pulled that Bosch off 
and put on another starter.

This is the fourth starter.  I am prepared with a fifth starter in reserve.  
(Two starters burned up on me; melted the inside plastic stuff, covering the 
starter 'coil' with solid plastic.  Smelled burnt, too)


Any suggestions??  This time I was able to get a GOOD measure of the voltage 
to the ignition wire spade on the solenoid.  It was just too much to 
believe.  It laughs at the idea of jumping the ignition wire spade to the 
power connector on the solenoid, and for putting a piggy back connection on 
the ignition wire spade, wired to be touched to the battery terminal when 
needed (this is what I had with the remote starter switch from the battery 
to the ignition wire spade.)

I need some solid technical advice, not 'take a friend' or 'park on an 
incline'.  I am using those techniques already!!

Any savvy friends out there care to respond??
