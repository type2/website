Subject: Grease

On my '71, while I have the clutch pedal assembly out to replace the clutch
cable, I decided to clean and grease the clutch pedal shaft. The grease that
was there was pretty good looking stuff - much thicker looking than the
general purpose grease that I was going to replace it with. I don't know if it
was factory grease but it sure did a good job of protecting the shaft - there
is very little wear after all these years and the grease is still a clean
golden color. Now I'm having second thoughts about using general purpose
grease here as this point gets a lot of use and there are no bearings to take
the load. Any recommendations on a good, easily obtainable grease that would
be applicable here or is general purpose grease OK?

Thanks,
Bill Moon
