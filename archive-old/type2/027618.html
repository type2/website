SO is taking a NC to Seattle trip (rental car..not Vdubb) then to Alaska by 
cruise ship. Out Westerly she ran across a splitte camper, left there with a 
blown engine. Bless her heart, she even crawled under to check out the rust 
(jack points are OK :). Let me ponder my chances of figuring out a way to 
get an upright engine out there to fetch it, for a coupla' days, and I'll 
post particulars such as I have, when I decide that it's too freakin' hard. 
By that time I'll also have figured out how to post to the splittie list.

Marv Krupp..with everything BUT a split.
