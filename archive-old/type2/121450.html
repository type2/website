Subject: Converting a 78 to a 74 type exhuast system

I've just purchased a complete 74 type exhaust system to use on my 78 2L FI
engine.  I've been reading lately about the alternator bracket and that it
is NLA.  Does anyone have a spare that I could purchase or can someone tell
me how to make one?  Also, I was told when I purchased the parts that I was
buying everything that I needed and I would like to confirm this.  I
purchased both heater boxes and the exhaust along with the gaskets.  Is
there anything else that I need?  I want to make sure that I have all of my
ducks in a row before I remove the engine from the bus.  Also, does anyone
have any insight that they could give me when attempting such a change?

My bus still has the crossover bar and it appears to be in good shape.  The
muffler, however, does have some holes in it.  Does anyone need a crossover
bar?  I'll be glad to give it to someone that could use it for only the cost
of shipping it.  I know that they are NLA.

Again, thanks in advance,
