&gt; This 73 transporter is my first vw experience so excuse the silly question.
&gt; When either the left or right turn signal is activated the dashboard
&gt; indicators for BOTH left and right illuminate.  Outside the bus just the
&gt; corresponding lights blink. The Bently seems top show only 1 dashboard light
&gt; circuit?  
&gt; Is this the way it is supposed to be?

yes, this is correct
