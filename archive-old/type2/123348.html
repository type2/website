Subject: Re: A focused question regarding charging batteries

Thank you David and Jamie. I applaud your ability to hold a meaningful
conversation without it degrading into a fight. This has been a wonderful
learning experience for me and particularly helpful for me with my '71
Adventurewagen. My Bus was constructed in an era when generators were used
but when my new engine was installed last week I upgraded to a Kymco 75
amp alternator. I have been concerned that this change might have
consequences with the wiring or the isolator (original to my conversion)
and your conversation has been quite helpful to me.
