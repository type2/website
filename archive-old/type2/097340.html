Subject: I'll throw in my dizzy question too - Hi Eric

I have a 75 that came with an 1800 and (I assume) stock distributor (I
haven't checked the number on it in a while and I've forgotten what it was).
I rebuilt the engine and through a long harrowing story of pain and
suffering at the hands of my machine shop I ended up rebuilding it into a
2.0L engine (actually they did to make up for some major f-ups they pulled).

Anyway the vaccum can on the distributor is shot so I plugged the lines from
the throttle housing on the FI and set the advance to 8 ATDC - so I'm
running purely mechanical... I have temp sensors and definitely heat up more
than I'd like (and lose speed and power) going uphill so I figured it's
about time I set things right. Anyone know which distributor I want
(vaccum/mechanical I assume) and where I can find one?

Thanks!

Bill
