Subject: Re: [T2] I can't get my reverse lights to work

76 westy

I've tried and tried to get my reverse lights to work, but nothing. The
Bentley doesn't help much. I looked at the wiring diagram and it helps a
little, but not much. There are too many loose wires running around in the
back end- years and years of other POs fixes.

I checked the bulbs with a volt meter, and they are good. I cleaned the 
switch
on the transmission. I still have nothing.
Can someone give me the run down on the complete system from light to...?

The backup-light switch is a series switch.  It allows current to flow(on my 
'70 at least, from the coil + terminal) from a power source, throught the 
switch to the lights when reverse is engaged.  Did you check continuity on 
the switch, both IN and OUT of reverse?  I see you say you cleaned the 
switch, but you may need to replace it.  Have you applied power directly to 
the reverse lights?  Might be a bad ground.  Have you checked the inline 
fuse between the power source and switch?  There should be one.
