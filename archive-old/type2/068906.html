Subject: questions on 78 

Got a couple of questions:
 
1. Hubby just put a Bosch 009 distributor in my 78 (2L) bus. What should
the advance be set at? Right now it's set at 7.5 degrees.

2. When running, the bus seems just fine...but when idling (doesn't matter
if it's in gear or not) she doesn't seem to idle without burps or &quot;farts&quot;.
She just doesn't idle smoothly....any suggestions/advice to help with this
problem?
 
BTW....hubby decided to customize the exhaust on her. Now she has dual
exhausts!
