the 32/36 is a weber carb, but the license to manufacture and sell it was
given to Holley (bought, I presume). There are Weber carbs, and Holley/Weber
carbs.

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I might be wrong but I think the 32/36 first appeared and was designed for
&gt; the Ford Pinto.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Talking with Scott Solomon today, and he mentioned that early K-cars and
&gt; &gt;Mopars of the frontwheel drive family used a Holley/Weber carb similar to
&gt; &gt;those offered as VW conversions by the usual SoCal, CalImports people.
He's
&gt; &gt;right, because I used to have a Dodge Omni and the carb was marked
Holley,
&gt; &gt;but looked almost identical to the 32/36. Does anyone know if these carbs
&gt; or
&gt; &gt;early Rabbit carbs (I think they were Zeniths) are re-jettable or usable
in
&gt; &gt;a centremount setup?
&gt; &gt;Interesting info for us people who like to tinker.
&gt; &gt;Thanks,
&gt; &gt;Courtney
