&gt;I have a 76 bus w/ 79 motor (code GE).
&gt;Driving at cruising speeds engine not hot normal temps(its about 30 degrees outside
 &gt;driving at speed (65mph or so) for about 10-12 mins, and bus starts to cut out and back in,
&gt;then out but still running kind of, no power, and lots of backfiring. Then pull over and bus dies.
&gt;Wait 2-3 mins and bus starts great and runs fine!
&gt;I replaced cap, rotor, coil, plugs, wires, fuel filter and so on.

Classic fool injection problem. Must get lucky to find an intermittent solution.
Either a defective component or a bad connection. Begin by examining wires
and connections, especially grounds. The engine wire harness can hide a lot
of defects, check wires for continuity from the ECU terminals ( ECU disconnected )
to their ends. Solder defective connections and scrape terminals clean.
Then follow Bentley procedures, don't assume new parts can be overlooked
because they are new. Don't assume, verify.
The quick answer was Temp Sender II and the double relay.
