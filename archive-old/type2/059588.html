Subject: Q: Adjusting Hydraulic Lifter Valves

I just got my 1982 aircooled Vanagon Westie back from the &quot;surgeon&quot; after
having a tranny transplant, new CV boots installed, and viton pushrod tube
seals installed. Anyway, I was talking to the mechanic about the valve
adjustments he made. The book says: &quot;tighten till they touch then two turns
beyond that&quot; is the proper way to adjust the valves with hydraulic lifters.
My mechanic claims that this is too much preload on the lifters and
typically tightens them 1/2 to 1 turn beyond touching. The question to the
List is:

1) is this dangerous? 
2)What would be the effect of not tightening them 2 turns over the long
run?

				Thanks,
