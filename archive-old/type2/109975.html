&lt;&lt; For most vw folks, the $11,500 price is a bit steep unless you look at it 
as a &quot;new car&quot;....which it mostly is.  They sure do look nice with 
metallic paint though. &gt;&gt;

OK, but the problem is that it's registered as a 19... Beetle. Is $11,500
the insurable price even as a completely restored 19... Beetle? After
all, you can't tell the insurance company what it really is, they take
a dim view of insuring a technically illegal vehicle...
