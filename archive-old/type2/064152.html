Subject: Shipping a westy bed

This would be a two part post.  Does anyone know who will ship a Westy
bed?  How do you box it up?  I imagine I will have to make one out of 
a dishwasher box or the like.  What about approximate costs to ship 
this thing about half way across the U.S?

Next, would the gentleman in Massachusetts with whom I discussed the 
possible sale of above said bed please contact me.  I lost your 
e-mail.  Thanks, Jim
