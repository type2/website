Hi. Another great bus that needs a home soon, or it will be parted out.
1970 hardtop camper
Raleigh, NC
one of the cleanest bodies I've seen in a long time- floors, rockers are 
GREAT! very little rust
engine knocks badly, needs rebuild
recently running, so everything but engine is probably ok. The owner took 
good care of the bus, and it has a lot of other new parts.
Interior is in good shape, but is missing the big wall cabinet
This is another bus that arrived dead at the shop, and is waaaaaaay too 
nice to be parted out. This bus can be had for $800, again which is 
negotiable. The owner just wants it to have a good home. 
Call Sean at 919-834-2800, and tell him I sent you. Another bus that 
needs to be saved.
