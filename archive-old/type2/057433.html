Subject: Er... anyone in OR want to help a newbie? :)

Okay, I got the title today and I officially own this 1971 T2 loaf thing.
(Not a &quot;Thing&quot;, just a &quot;thing&quot;.)  It needs clutch adjustment and something
has to be done to the hand brake cables -- whether it involves reattaching
them somewhere or putting in new ones, I don't know.

I have John Muir's very informative book, and a repair manual, and I've
looked over how these things would be done, but I'm really brand new to
VWs and to car repair at any level.  I'm somewhat mechanically inclined,
and I did try to adjust the clutch cable wing nut myself,
fairly unsuccessfully (without jacking the bus up).

I'd like to get the clutch and parking brake working, so it'll be
driveable, and then I can take over from there.  (Everyone says &quot;Just do
it yourself&quot;, I know...)

Is there anyone around northwest Oregon or southwest Washington who would
be willing to come by, get this thing going for me, maybe show me some
stuff about it?  I'd definitely pay a fair price for the work.  I'm in
Portland, OR.  Email me at bnewman_at_aracnet_dot_com.
