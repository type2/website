Subject: VW sighting

Hello once again. While a

 camping and hiking the Cabbo Bend Trail at Lake 
Ouchita, I spotted a orange mid 70s Westfalia for sale on the highway going to 
the lake outside of Hot Springs connecting to highway 270. From a distance the 
body look in good condition. Wasn't able to get any closer due to the fact I cannot walk through barbwire yer
