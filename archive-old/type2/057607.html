Subject: A/C update

I swore I would not go through another Texas summer without A/C in the bus.
Summer is almost over and I still don't have it working, but I'm making
progress.  My goal is to have it working before I leave for Jerome on Sept.
9th.  I'm fitting a rotary compressor in the engine compartment where the
air pump used to live and will be using refrigerant 134A.  The rest of the
system will be as DPD designed it.

Today I hooked up the electrical part of the system and tested it out, and
removed the condensor.  The power to the overhead DPD evaporator unit had
never been hooked up, in fact I didn't even know how to hook it up.  A
couple of weeks ago I found another overhead unit in the junkyard and
bought it for a pittance.  I spent some time looking over the wiring and
now I know how it all works.  There is one large wire going into the system
and two smaller ones coming out.  The large one is to be hooked to the
battery and the two smaller ones go to the compressor and the fans on the
evaporator.  Pretty simple.

I located the large power wire in my bus and hooked it up, but it was
drawing way too much power - the 10 gauge wire was getting warm to the
touch - and the evaporator fans were barely turning.  I decided to unhook
the condensor fans, thinking the motors were probably frozen and shorted
out - the A/C on this bus has not worked since I've had it (11 years) and
probably not for a few years before that either.  Unhooking the condensor
fans worked - the evaporator fans now came on full power for the first time
since the Reagan administration, and they worked nicely.  Lots of air out
of the vents, and separate controls for left and right 3-speed fans.

I dropped the condensor unit, which is mounted flat underneath the center
of the bus, and took the fan assembly off of the top.  Hooked it up at the
bench and only one fan turned.  Apparently the fans are 6V because they are
wired in series.  The fans were mounted left and right, and where the wire
crossed under the heater tube it had been pinched and had worn through the
insulation.  There were obvious signs of shorting and insulation melt.  I'm
guessing this is why the unit was originally unhooked.  What a shame that
such a complicated system was rendered non-functional for so long because
someone made a bad choice routing a wire.  I installed a new piece of wire
and mounted it on the side of the evaporator so it didn't have to run under
the tube anymore.  One of the fans did not turn but after a few minutes
with the rust penetrant and turning the blade by hand it started to run on
it's own.  I let the fans run for a couple of hours and they seemed fine -
the motors were only warm to the touch and were drawing about 4 amps.

The condensor was a mess.  It looked like a riverbed on top - lots of
gravel and small rocks sitting on it.  It took a while to get the fittings
loose but I finally freed them and removed the condensor completely.  I
spent about 1/2 hour blowing the fins out with compressed air and the
garden hose, and finally combing it with a wire brush.  Didn't come close
to getting all of the gravel out but it was the best I could do.  I will
take it in tomorrow to be flushed.

The entire assembly, condensor+fans+shroud+louvers weighs almost 35 lbs.
Cripes!  That's a lot of weight.  The overhead unit weighs at least another
40, maybe more, and the compressor is at least 20.  With hoses, I'm
guessing the complete system weighs 120 lbs.  But I guess that's the price
you pay to stay cool.
