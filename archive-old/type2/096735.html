&lt;&lt; The problem is when the bellows gets a hole they can no longer expand and 
the flaps stay closed. &gt;&gt;

I'm curious,.... how would it &quot;get a hole&quot;?  I've seen many failed ones in a 
full state of expansion but I have never seen a failed one with holes in it 
or one that has not expanded.

I am assuming the lower tin was not in place and it was damaged during off 
roading by debris or rocks?
