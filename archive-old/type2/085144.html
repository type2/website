Subject: [T2] STABILAZER LINK ??  HELP

Happy Friday Everyone !!
Okay so I have an 80 westy that came without the driver side stablizer link or bushings.  I got all parts but can't seem to get the lower bushing thought the little hole.  Any body have any suggetions on how to get it in.  Any help on the top one would be great as well. Also should these questions (body front end ect..) go to the vanagon list or type 2 because it is air cooled? Hoping to take it on its first camping trip this weekend about 50 miles away. :)
Thanks
Kevin
