&gt; &gt; &gt; I am going to have my Bus pulling a float (farm wagon that can be
&gt; &gt; &gt; pulled by one person so isn't to heavy) in a parade and was wondering
&gt; &gt; &gt; if the List could give me some advice (besides not to do it) on
&gt; &gt; &gt; keeping my engine cool.  Of course it will be hot that day and I will
&gt; &gt; &gt; be going at idle speed.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I drove mine in a parade once and wasn't towing anything, it is as you
&gt; &gt; suspect quite hard on the engine cooling.
&gt; 
&gt; I dont see why. I can sit in 90+ degrees in rush hour traffic and temps
&gt; are maybe 190. I just dont see vws overheating fron too slow conditions
&gt; like water pumpers.

it's not the sitting still, it's the moving at 1mph that takes the toll.
auto tranny actually works better than manual in this case because of
having to ride the clutch...you spend your time holding back the vehicle
not waiting
BTDT won't do it again!
but of course YMMV
