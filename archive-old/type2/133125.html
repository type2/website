Subject: Re: [T2] Compression Ratio and New Heads

Jason,

1.  Compression ratios are generally raised by cutting metal
    *from* the sealing surface of the heads where they meet the pistons.
    Heads from your supplier should be pretty much stock in that 
    department....probably best to cc them anyway....and at that point
    would result in a CR of about stock....not 8:1.

2/3 cc them and then read the books to see how close you want to be.
    All of them being equal would result in smoother better power...
    at the expense of several hours of labor(or machine work).

4.  If you are in to this, then buy the Fischer book...&quot;how to Hot Rod 
    Your Volkswagen Engine&quot; and read it, and then read it again and again 
    until you know what they are talking about and how to modify your 
    heads slightly to make cc's match.  Don't touch your heads till
    after that!

You can always put it together just like at the factory...I can guarantee 
you that they never cc'd a t4 head...except maybe the first time they came 
out of the casting machine...just to be sure that it wasn't too far off
from all the others and would give something close to the correct CR.

Never add shims to the top of a cylinder to change the CR.  That would
make your heads sit lopsided a little on top of the cylinders...among many 
other things bad about doing that.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt; 

&lt;some snipped&gt;
&gt; The saga of my engine continues!  So far, I have cleaned everything, done 

&gt; intended).  I have a (relatively) stock GD-series 2.0 FI with oval exhaust 
&gt; ports.
&gt; 
&gt; I've been reading many different sources about Compression Ratio.  It seems 
&gt; that &quot;CC-ing&quot; the heads may or may not be required, shims may or may not be 
snip&gt; 
&gt; So, my questions are as follows:
&gt; 1. If I buy reman heads from Bus Depot/AVP, do I need to CC them, or is this 
&gt; a typical step in the rebuild process?
&gt; 2. If I bolt the heads on without testing CR, am I in danger of getting the 
&gt; CR too high, or does the typical rebuilding process take this into account?
&gt; 3. If I have combustion chambers that are different, can I put shims under 
&gt; one cylinder and not another, or do I need to get them re-machined?
&gt; 4. Can somebody who has done this before give me more insight as to what I 
&gt; can look for and avoid?  There are many sources, and many different 
&gt; processes.
&gt; 
&gt; I have a call in to AVP, and hopefully they can give some insight into this 
&gt; as well.  Ideally, this rebuild will have a tight exhaust (unlike the last 
&gt; one), good power, and good reliability.  I love my Bus, I just don't want to 
&gt; have to do this again in another 25,000 miles -- aren't Type4 engines 
&gt; supposed to be &quot;bulletproof???&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance for any help, advice, or suggestions.
