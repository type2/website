&gt; I seem to remember it being firm when I installed it. The bus was
&gt; cold, sat all night, there seems to be a little slack in the cable
&gt; and I could squeeze the thermostat together like an accordian. 

There is a spec in the bentley for the length of the thermostat at a
particular temperature. It sounds like yours has failed. I'd love to
just give you the spec, but for some reason I suspect my bentley is
hiding from me :(
