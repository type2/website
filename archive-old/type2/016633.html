Garp:
I think the very best way would be to weld it with a plasma welder. I
doubt that any local welding shops have plasma welders and if they do
their technicians are probably not experienced in welding plastic. This
is more likely used in an OEM setting, but if you have a community
college that has a welding program, they might be able to handle the
task and welcome the challenge. We do have such a program in our town.
Lacking a plasma welder, a two-part (catalysed) glue might be the next
best thing. I don't remember the brand, but it smelled so bad it must be
good stuff!
good luck,
