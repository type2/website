&gt;Huh?  Most busses I have worked on have never had the lifters adjusted even
&gt;close to zero lash......Usually they are all crappy.  I adjust the lifters
&gt;to zero and people drive off and call me telling me their car never runs so
&gt;good!

I meant the way he said to assemble them, not the way he says to
adjust them.

&gt;I&gt; at most I've only put together 4-5 T4's a year but I've never had a
&gt;&gt; problem doing it with compressions warm or cold, but I have observed
&gt;&gt; the problem he alludes to on Steve's old '73 ('79 engine) before we
&gt;&gt; put a rebuilt engine in it.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I would go with Bob's advice on this since he probably rebuilds at least 30
&gt;or 40 type 4 engines per year  along with a bunch of wasserboxers and type 1
&gt;engines........

Well let's see Bob builds 40 a year, VW built like 4000?  I don't know,
never seen the problem.  My personal experience.  I do recall Stephens
and others alluding to this problem when using aftermarket lifters with
smaller bleed holes in the side.  But like I said, till I see the problem I'm
not apt to run the hydraulics at zero lash.  The 2 I built last year had 120
psi all round, cold, warm, whatever.  Nope it isn't 40, but it is my
experience
with the last 15-20 hydraulic lifter Type 1, 4, and Vanagon engines I've
touched.

YMMV.
