Subject: Re: [T2] Tranny in a bus that's been sitting awhile

I too have a 70 that sat for 1 yr. I would also be very interested in any
responses because I was told the easiest thing to do was to put the motor in
and see what happens. If the trans is bad I can remove it w/o pulling the
engine.
    Someone from the list also suggested that I check my CV Joints. That was
terrific advice as one axle had a pair of torn boots.

Later,
