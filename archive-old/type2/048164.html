Dear Clark.

Headlamp washers appear to have been standard, on the Swedish specification, 
1973-79 VW Type 2. They are mounted on special bumper overriders and the 
normal air-pressurised washer reservoir, is replaced by a very large black 
plastic reservoir, which replaces the whole right-hand kickboard, in the 
cab.

Both the windscreen washers and headlamp washers, are supplied with water, 
by means of separate electric pumps, requiring a different steering-column 
mounted wash/wiper switch.

Regards.
              Nigel A. Skeet
