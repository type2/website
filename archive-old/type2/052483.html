&gt; As well, turned drums, which you don't know if you got unless you pull and 
&gt; measure them, typically don't match the arc of the stock sized shoes. 

Couple of related, Friday brake questions:

1) Am I correct in assuming that brake drums/rotors never need to be turned unless 
	they are scored?

2) When people talk about rear brake lines having collapsed, I assume they mean
	the hoses running from the metal brake lines into the drum.  Is this a correct
	assumption?

3) Having flushed my brake system until the fluid ran clean, what do I do with the
	used brake fluid if the place I dispose of my oil (a FLAPS) will not accept it?
	I specifically mean in California, but general information is appreciated as I
	periodically move to different states.


I'm getting ready to do a major overhaul of my brakes in a month of so i'm trying
to prepare my .todo list...
