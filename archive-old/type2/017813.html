    Pretty standard procedure by gas professionals on new installations,
which is what I was talking about, or during repairs. Of course, if it's
an existant installation, and you smell leaking gas, you need to
ventilate the area before doing *ANYTHING* else. I used to have a
business caretaking summer homes, dealt with gas appliances on a daily
basis. My son also worked for the local Propane distributor and drove
the gas truck, did installations. The only other way to test a joint you
just put together is with a soapy solution, which is quite messy. All
it's going to do us produce a very small flame.
