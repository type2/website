Subject: Re: [T2] timing

From: &quot;jason antolovich&quot;:

Well i finished adjusting my valves and then my
points.  I am now trying to adjust my timing to 10
degrees after TDC.  When i put the tiing light on it
reads 10 degrees before TDC.  When i move the
distributor to advance the timing to spec the engine
barely runs and if i give it any gas it dies and white
smoke pops out of the top of the carbs.  IS there any
reason why my engine seems to run best around 0
degrees and barely runs at 10 after TDC?

Well, yeah, 10 AFTER is severely RETARDING your engine.

WHY are you doing this????
