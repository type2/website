i asked this ? yesterday with no response, so I thought I would ask one =
more time.  I have a green wire coming off my bosch VR in my 73 bus.  It =
is about 4 inches long and has a female connector on it.  It is not =
hooked up to anything.  Does anyone have any idea where this wire should =
go?  My bentley arrives today, so maybe I won't need to ask as many ?'s =
in the future.

Thanks again for eveybodies help.
