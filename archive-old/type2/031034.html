&gt; I'm crusing along the highway and right as I get to about 62 mph the van
&gt; starts &quot;bumping.&quot; That's about as well as I can explain it. It seems like it
&gt; is dying then not dying in a matter of 1/2 second. Quickly tapping the
&gt; brakes would produce a silmilar effect. There is no pattern and the van
&gt; won't go past 62 mph now (It did 70 easy before). My only thought is that

well the 80 is supposed to have a rev limiting rotor.  but it really takes
some revs to get it to operate.  it would do what you describe though.


&gt; maybe it's not shifting to 4th gear but I don't have a tach so I can't

do you think you don't actually get it in 4th or is it an automatic. which
is only a 3 speed.  if an automatic you shouldn't go faster than 45-50 max
in 2nd.  you should be able to feel it shift around 35-40 or so 

&gt; really tell. It's pretty noisy at 60 mph so I can't hear much of anything
&gt; coming from back there. Any ideas? Maybe carb. related?(I have a weber
&gt; progessive)

not sure how a carb would affect things as the later automatic is a rev
controled shifter
