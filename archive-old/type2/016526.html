&gt; Hmm. It makes we wonder if my bus would run better with higher octane gas...

An old time VW buff and professional mechanic told me to always use premium gas.
He said the engines were designed to run on &quot;regular&quot; but when they were designed, &quot;regular&quot; was 92+ octane. I use 93 octane in my '74 and performance is excellence.
If this was bad advice, I am open to additional information.
ttfn,
Bob
