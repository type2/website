Good point about the gaskets...less potential for leaks.
I have a NICE set of 72/74 exchangers and a stock muffler just itching to be installed on my 77. I'm still looking for the risers and flaps though. I would like to put the whole thing in at the same time.

I cant believe it's 108 degrees and Im thinking about heat....weird.

If anyone has 72/74 risers and flaps, let me know...I've been looking!
