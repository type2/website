Subject: Re: [T2] Blowing Oil and No Power (81 Vanagon Westy)

Define your term &quot;rebuild&quot;.
Blowby can be verified with proper
compression and leak-down tests.
You may find a broken ring or ring land at #2.
Loss of power at one cylinder amounts to 25%
of total engine output HP.(&quot;very low power&quot;).
General blowby can be caused by re-ring used p/c
which failed to seat, and will indicate with the tests
Gray goop may be original assembly lube if the
strainer never got cleaned since the 10K rebuild.
Was any of it magnetic, or shiny aluminum flakes ?
Did you drain the oil in a white pail and find all the
contaminants in an aoto-paint style paper strainer?
You may be due for another rebuild.
Buy the Tom Wilson book first, even if it's going to a shop
Confirm hot idle oil pressure and running temperatures
before disassembly. Maybe the bottom end is still good.
Stop by if you are ever in the neighborhood:)

&gt; I need some help with my 81 Vanagon Westy.  The basic symptoms are very
low
&gt; power and lots of oil coming out of the rear seal, but the oil leaks only
if
&gt; the van driven at speeds of 45 MPH or faster.  This is on an engine with
&gt; about 10k on a rebuild by a local shop.  The engine skips on #2 cylinder,
&gt; and I've tried all new ignition components with out success.  There is
gray
&gt; goop on the inside of the oil screen cover.  I get lots of air blowing out
&gt; the PVC case vent when the PVC hose is unhooked (engine idling).
&gt;
&gt; I think I'm getting excessive blowby from #2, which causes high crank case
&gt; pressure, which in turn blows oil out the rear (auto tranny end) seal.
&gt;
&gt; How should I go about fixing this beast??
