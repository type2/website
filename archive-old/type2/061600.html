Subject: Sorry, I didn't mean to do it

Hello George,
Your right and I'm sorry, I didn't even think about our fellow listees
and me throwing SPAM all over their monitors, not to mention the
security of my friends addresses. The Type II list is the only list I
subscribe to, so like you said I didn't think that move through. Okay
enough groveling I'm starting to spam again. I apologize to the list &amp; I
Thank you for the reality smack, Mike 73 Westy
