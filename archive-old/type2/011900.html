Alex,
  the sender, as you probably know, is a simple resistive
slider kinda like those slider volume controls on boom
boxes . They tend to gunk up making them intermittent.
Perhaps when you parked it it a &quot;varnish&quot; formed on the
element (Resistive coating) and after it was moving around
again the slidding contact wore through the varnish, once
again making good contact. This is just speculation based
on your query tho.

Can the fuel sending unit fix itself after using it a 
while?? My 1973 was sitting for about 1 year. The fuel
level was 
never correct after I started her up. Lately the fuel level

is correct (after 3-4 months of continual use)??? What 
happened??
