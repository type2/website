Subject: Can a solenoid be swapped w/o removing starter? ('80)
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Well, the lurking is over, I recently bought a 1980 Vanagon Camper (P22
Basic Model), &quot;Rustfalia&quot;, and drove it home with no problems and now I've
joined the list.  This list is an incredible resource!

After looking at all of the little things that needed to be fixed, I
promptly ordered many parts to install.  One of the items was the engine
compartment seal.  Apparently the PO had put in some kind of foam seal
partway around (could this be from a beetle or other VW?).  I'm new to
aircooled engines, but I knew that this was fairly critical to engine
cooling, so I got in there and installed that sucker (don't want to do that
again anytime soon).  After that, I was feeling like I had just done
something virtuous for my newly beloved camper, so I took a lunch break and
proudly told my wife how much cooler it would run now.  After lunch, it
would crank, but not start.

I had ordered a Bentley and Bosch book, but without them in hand, I checked
the basics:  spark was there, so I got under the van while the starter was
cranking to listen/feel the fuel pump for action (with the air flow valve
open) - nothing!  Took my meter to the pump contacts while cranking and got
a lower amperage than mentioned in the awful manual which came with the van
(Factory Manual from VOA has pretty pictures, but the Bentley is much
nicer).  I attached leads directly from the battery to the pump and it
worked great, so I figure I must have knocked an electrical component loose
while installing the seal.  I went through the engine compartment with a
fine tooth comb and checked all connections (although I never cleaned or
replaced any).  I tested the double relay with a test light while cranking
and there was no juice (although the battery by now is not at its finest).
Tried connecting the fuel pump right to battery while cranking and STILL not
a fart.  Double relay test procedure is sketchy in my book.  Could someone
post a good way?

Now back to the original subject of this post.  I figured out that the
double relay gets its power from the solenoid when the key is in start, so I
got under and looked at the starter/solenoid.  Boy, was it crusty.  OK, I
thought, I'll disconnect wires, clean and reinstall and then try again.  Put
my socket on the terminal with the braided ground wire to the starter and
torqued - crack!  The whole bolt came completely out (with nut still stuck)
and broke the plastic housing and braid right off!  I called my favorite
parts place and had three options:

1)  Reman. solenoid for $24.95 (lifetime warrantee)
2)  Reman. solenoid/starter for ~$85 with core (lifetime warrantee)
3)  New Bosch solenoid/starter for well over $100 (2 year warrantee)

Guy on phone tried to convince me to go with the whole enchilada, but I went
with the solenoid, because I assumed that my starter was fine.  I also
ordered the Bosch WR1 starter relay kit.  Has anyone replaced the solenoid
without removing the starter?  If I have to remove the whole thing, perhaps
I should replace the whole thing.  Bottom bolt of the starter looks easy,
but what do I have to remove to get to the top bolt if necessary?  I plan on
cleaning all electrical contacts when I reinstall.  What is good for
grinding down rusty connectors to bare metal?  What is good to spray or rub
on contacts to protect (dielectric grease or I've seen red stuff sprayed on
battery contacts)?  I also noticed that the thick, braided ground wire from
the transmission to the chassis is crusty.  Can you order a pre-cut, crimped
replacement, or do you have to buy a coil and DIY?  I'd like to overhaul all
ground straps on the vehicle.  Besides the battery to chassis, where are the
rest?

Thanks to anyone who has read for this long.  Every day I look at the
camper, I get excited about actually using it to camp out for the first
time.  Any help/ideas would be appreciated.

John
