Subject: Leisure Battery

Hello

I have a 73 Westy and was wondering if anyone could help me.

I have what appears to be battery starps for an additional battery (leisure 
Battery) however I can see how I switch from the regular Battery onto the 
leisure battery when I am camping and want to use the leisure battery for 
lights etc.  Can anyone help me on this please?

Cheers
Matt
