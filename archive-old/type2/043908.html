Mark,

I bought my Vanagon with a bad engine.

The lady I bought it from repeatedly insisted that it had a new engine, and
would not accept my explanations as to why it would not run. She said it
just needed a valve adjustment. We finally made a deal anyway.

When I got home I looked through the paperwork, and it sure enough DID have
a new engine, 15,000 miles previously, from GEX. There were also about ten
different receipts for valve adjustments over the 15K lifespan of the
engine.

This 15K GEX engine leaked oil like a sieve and had no compression in #3.

When I removed the engine, the valve seat for #3 exhaust was around the stem
up in the port.

I now have 15K on my AVP engine that I installed myself, it runs perfectly,
and I have only had to adjust the valves once!     8^)'

&gt;From what I have read on this list, my experience with GEX is typical.
Search the archives under GEX to see what I mean.
