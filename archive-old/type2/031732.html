&gt; Personally I've never like the swooshiness and

&gt; Manufacturers are putting these on the little SUV's. 
&gt; Those are interesting to me.  I haven't checked the
&gt; load ratings so I don't know if these would work?

I have the Michelin 205/70 14 XMS tires (now Agilis somethings)which are
an all season radial with a 99S load rating...(18xx some odd Lbs, will
look later if it makes a difference)  haven't noticed any swooshiness? but
like someone said they are harder to turn so I always am trying to be
moving a little when I have to turn em at slow speed, bit of a hard
ride too, agressive tread pattern, I ski and it has always gotten me
on and off the mountain...I like em
