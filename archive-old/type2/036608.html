Subject: timing on '78 engine

Yesterday I found out the PO on my bus had set the timing to
7.5o -AFTER- TDC on my 77 bus with a 78 engine.
So any ways I set the timing now to 7.5o BEFORE TDC and
it seems to be running better and having less CO emissions.
So what I want to know is if 7.5o BEFORE TDC is the right timing
for a 78 engine?
According to muir's book and the archive it seems to be right.
But as I remember correctly the haynes book said different.

Also about what the PO did should I be worried at all for the engine?
Is there any way to get rid of all the carbon build up from the
timing be so retarted?

I timed the engine with a static light, I read somewhere though
I should use strobe light. Muir didn't think to highly of it though.
Static timing OK?

Alex,
