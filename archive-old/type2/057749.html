Subject: hydraulic valve lifters or not?

If you get a noise that's deeper that ther usual tickety tick of the normal
valve lash of nonhydraulics and happens all the time irrespective of load
or rpms, it's probably a lifter not pumped up; can happen when it's left to
sit a few days or the little hole in the side4 of the lifter happens to
point down.  I've taken up to 8 miles of driving to pump up one of these
suckers- drive it about 15 minutes to see if the noise goes away.  If it
doesn't, pull the valve cover on the side it seems to be coming from (you
did listen about a foot away, yes?) and get the front cylinder at top dead
center.  Rock the rockers back and forth- do you hear tapping noises of
clearance in a non-hydraulic?  If yes, it's not hydraulic- but I'd move on
to check some other cylinders, turning the crank counterclockwise 180 deg.
to get to the next cylinder in sequence 1,2,3,4.
Check that one.  If you get tapping, it's likely not hydraulic.  If it's a
non-pumped up lifter, it will feel very spongy.
Beware the rocker will be hot if you do this right after driving; you can
wait overnite to try this; you're more liable to get squishiness in
hydraulic lifters.   If you feel no clearance, I'd check the others to see
if they are all like that, and then get one to TDC and back off the
tightening nut and carefully loosen the adjustor- does it go back a few
turns before it no longer touches the valve stem?  Then it's hydraulic,
adjusted about 2 turns in from actual contact.
