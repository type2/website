Subject: RE: [T2] BN4 Instuctions and Templates

&gt; I've sent a few Xeroxed copies of the BN4 Gas Heater installation
&gt; instructions and templates out but as I suspected, my bill at Kinko's is
&gt; getting larger. Since I can't scan, I hope to have one of these copies in
&gt; the hands of another list member who agreed to find a place on
&gt; his web site for the stuff.


Quite some time ago, I gave copies of Eberspacher service manuals for a
couple of gas heaters to a listmember, who then posted them to a website.  I
think they were the BN4 and BA4 if memory serves me correctly. I believe
Darrell Boehler's son did the scanning on them, and another listmember was
also involved in the project. (Forgive me if my memory is incorrect; this
goes back a few years.)  Last I checked (admittedly a good 6 months ago or
more) they were still accessable (perhaps indirectly) via some link on
www.type2_dot_com.  These were service manuals, not installation manuals, and I
don't recall templates being included, but perhaps there is still some
duplication of information.  If so, you could focus only on info that is not
already there, which would make the project a bit smaller.  As I recall
there were a good 20 or 30 pages in each manual that was scanned.
