Subject: Re: [T2] 70 turn signal switch wanted??

OK, let's quit getting confused on the Turn Signal Switches, answers below:

&gt; my chassis number is 220 2049568

i'll look for both J and G switches... but where in the heck is the
&gt; part # on the switch???

*******************************
You won't find a part number on any of the switches. Never were, never will
be.
*******************************

&gt; oh, one more thing - what size are the screws that hold the t/s
&gt; switch in the housing, and the housing to the column? i se the
&gt; bentley says m5, etc, but what pitch/thread?

*******************************
The screws are as follows:
211 953 571 B 4x6 Switch to Housing
 2x9 172 450 thru 2x4 2164 059
N0107851 4x12 Housing to Column
 2x8 000 001 thru 2x9 172 449
211 953 571 A 5x12 Housing to Column
 2x9 172 450 thru 2x4 2164 059
 You will notice I didn't mention the Housing to Switch Screw for 68 thru
2x9 172 450 - VW never offered a replacement in their catalog, but I believe
they were the same as the 66-67 switches which were a 3 x 12mm (VW
N0107811).
 The &quot;N&quot; screws were standard Cheese-Head Din 920 Screws which are similar
to the Engine Tin Screws (6x12mm). The &quot;211&quot; Screws were also Din 920 with
what the Europeans called &quot;Button Heads&quot;. We would prolly call them &quot;Reduced
Cheese-Head&quot; Screws - they had to be in order to clear the recesses and/or
holes when secured down. I collect these screws whenever I find them, but I
would have to check my stash to see if I have any laying around. Not the
easiest ones to find. Regarding the thread pitch, I don't know right off,
but it's not anything weird other than it is standard DIN pitch for the size
(0.6, 0.5, 0.4???)(Note - the 4mm taillight screws and the 5mm Window Crank
Screws are the same thread pitch as a reference). It's certainly not
Japanese (JIS) fine thread.
*************************
 Here is the definitive OE VW list for replacement Turn Signal Switches for
the 68-79 US Market Type 2:
 211 953 513 G Type 2 68-71, This is an 8 wire switch (6 wires for the
Turn/Stoplight Circuits, 2 for the Headlight Dimmer Relay). SWF discontinued
this one several years ago and at VWG we are currently developing a repro -
prototypes are OK, but they are REAL &quot;clunky&quot; and need refinement before we
offer them for sale. A lot of time and money (more than we imagined) is
going into developing this switch and we wanna do it right!
 211 953 513 J Type 2 1972 ONLY, Looks just like the &quot;G&quot; Switch, except with
5 wires (3 for the Turn Circuits, 2 for the Headlight Dimmer Relay).
Remember, 1972 models started coming with the separate Turn Bulbs from the
Tail/Stop Bulbs. I've used this switch on 68-71 when converting to the
European separate bulb Rear Tail/Stop Bulb, Turn Bulb (the real ones, not
the crappy Brazilian junk). Available very sporadically, VWG will eventually
make a repro of this one next year once we've got the &quot;kinks&quot; out of the &quot;G&quot;
repro.
 211 953 509 H Type 2 73-March 74 (To Vin 2x4 2164 059), utilized with the
separate Column Wiper Stalk Switch on the opposite side of the column. SWF
discontinued this switch early this year and at VWG we are looking into
reproing it sometime late next year.
 211 953 513 K Type 2 March 74-79 (Fr Vin 2x4 2164 060)
 Karl is very correct when trying to follow the &quot;M&quot; Codes regarding
switches, which is why I've depended more on &quot;field&quot; experience, having
owned a 61, 67, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73 and 77 Type 2s in the past.
 Hope anything in this post helps :-)
