 &gt; Any suggestions for the remote filter location - my engine is out now, so
 &gt; it's hard to recognise.

 &gt; Dear John,

I sugest that if you have an oil hose long enough to reach up to the left 
air intake of the engine compartment (i mean the one on the left upper side)
you should put it there. There it's protected against everything and has 
always a nice airflow cooling it. Well i think it mostly depends on your 
oilpump. If it will have no trouble lifting the oil to the cooler on the 
airintake you should place it there. Maybe you can design some tin squirts, 
or sheets that you can place around the oilcooler to use eficiently all the 
air that comes into the engine compartment. By the other side it will cause 
the air of the engine compartment to heat up some more, consequently feedin' 
hot air to the blower of the engine...

Well, right now even i'm confused about this...

I hope you figure it out right, if you do so send me an mail please...(!!)

Michel
