Subject: Number 3 inlet valve problem

Hi,
    Before I start dissecting my engine I am interested in any comments on
the following problem.

Just over a week ago my 2L engine(76 camper) started idling roughly,
backfiring and generally sounding really sick. A quick check showed that
No. 3 was not having much input into things, so I checked the tappets and
found that there was no gap on the intake valve. I adjusted it only to find
the same thing occurring several days later; adjusted it again only to find
the same problem this morning. I should point out that the locking nut is
not coming lose....it's staying as tight as I set it.
After resetting it everything runs fine for awhile but you can feel it
slowly losing it again.
   It has been suggested to me that the valve could have burnt but I'd
appreciate any comments before I start any major surgery as time to do so
is rather scarce at the present.

    Thanks
             Neil
