Hi Weston,
        I did this job on my '81 Westy.  I am not an experienced mechanic,
I'd say this was not a tough job. I am not sure if it is necessary to
replace both tierod-ends at the same time, but I do not think its
necessary.  If you are going to replace the tierod-end anyway you can use
a tool called a &quot;pickle fork&quot; to separate the tierod-end.  I got a cheap
one from Harbor Freight Tools, about $5, it worked great but it destroys
the boot on the tierod-end.  There is a better tool pictured in the manuals
and available from JC Whitney, about $25, this does not destroy the boots
when you use it.  I got my tierod-ends for less than $20 each, from a
FLAPS. The boots on the tierod-end are not replaceable.
        I would recommend that you inspect and consider replacing the boots
on the steering box at the same time.  Mine were in sorry shape.  I got
both boots, OEM, from Bus Boys for $8.
        One tip I read some where, don't remember where: clean the threads
on the tierod where the lock nut clamps down on the tierod-end, then count
the number of threads showing.  This will show you how far on to put the
new tierod-end.  You should still get an alignment after you have change
the tierod-end.  I think that shops don't like to play with the front end
because they don't like to do the alignments.
        Tip too: lube nuts the day before with a penetrating lube.

        Good Luck
