Subject: Can any psychics out there identify my carb?

I know, a dumb question, but ...

This morning  I decided I'd had enough of stalling, hesitation, etc
and it was time to get rid of the mechanical distributor and replace
it with an SVDA.

I get to the order screen at aircooled_dot_net, and I need to know my
Carb to order the right one.

I know its a Webber, center mount, fitted by the PO. (The engine is
a 74, originally california).

Its got a big rectangular air cleaner on top, a vacuum line on the 
back (of the bus), and the linkage on the right (of the bus).

I cant find any other identification on it.

Is this enough information to identify it without a picture?
If not, where do I look for identifying marks?

kevin.
