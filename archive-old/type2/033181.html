Subject: oil filer tube and jb

Thanks to all that have emailed me about the jb weld.  My purpose though  was 
to ask if anyone knew where I could find the plastic tube that connects to 
the j tube.  I was trying to repair that plastic thing and it still leaks.  
I'm sure that jb weld works but it didn't in this case, I need that tube.  If 
anyone can help me please let me know.
Thanks to you all!
