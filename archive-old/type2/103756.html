Subject: Re: [T2] Check those poptop latches!!!

&gt; The other day I saw a 68-73 style camper going down I-280 and the
&gt; poptop had become partially detached at the front and was surfing the
&gt; wind. I tried to let the driver know there was something wrong but he
&gt; ignored me thinking I must have been some kind of looney.


He ignored you because that's pretty much normal for a 68-69 bus at least.
If I recall they redesigned the front hinges a bit, though I don't recall
when...post 69 I know.  They included a bit of a latch that helped to hold
the front of the top down.  The latch engaged automaticly as the poptop
was pulled down.

Prior to that it's normal for the top to ride 1-2 inches up at highway
speed, sometimes more depending on how worn the slots in the hinges are...
