Subject: Re: [T2] VW vs Porsche Backyard Mechanic?

In a message dated 7/19/04 4:43:57 PM, philcappellini_at_hotmail_dot_com writes:

&lt;&lt; My question is to those that are fortunate enough to have two great air 
cooled cars. How easy or hard is it to work on the Porsche's compared to the 
VW? Are parts as available as the VW? Is the Porsche network as good as the 
VW one? Any other comments/advice?

Thanks in advance for help, Phil.
