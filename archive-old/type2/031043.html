&gt; My mechanic Greg has left Metric Systems in Cambridge, MA.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone have dealings with other shops in the area?

my mechanic is picking up shop and moving to the Boston area come fall.
he is one of the best late model bus mechanics I have found and he knows
Fuel Injection.   I will be sorry to see him leave but his wife has gotten
a great position in Boston so he is packing up all his &quot;Stuff&quot; and moving
North.   His Name is Bruce Wilson, don't know where or how he will be set
up but I have no qualms about reccomending him, with only one caution.
  he is frequently slow and doesn't finish when he says he will, mostly
because he bites off more than he can chew, 

if I know when and where he will be reopening I'll post it here, for now
I'm getting a lot of stuff that I don't want to do done...
