Subject: Leaking nipple

Hi list
Got a qestion for you. I did a fuel psi test on my 76 bus 2.0 FI
and now i've got a leak at the test nipple. my qestion is.. Is there a
rubber gasket under the hex head bolt? thats on top of the fuel port. I
didn't notice if there was one when i took it off. But that doesn't mean
that it wasn't there. right now i've only got a metal to metal seal. It just
seeps out form underneth the hex head and i don't think that the metal fuel
line is damaged in anyway. it's just not sealing right. do i need to replace
to bolt?  

Gary 76 bus. Boise Id
