&gt; &gt;It's interesting to compare the insight and the bus in terms of economics.
&gt; &gt;You can get the insight for about $20K or a nice bus for about $5K  The
&gt; &gt;price premium is about $15K for the Insight.  At $2 a gallon, that 15K
&gt; &gt;will buy you about 7500 gallons of gas.  At 20MPG, that gas will carry you
&gt; &gt;about 150,000 miles.  You can also take along a (literal) ton of stuff or
&gt; &gt;six of your closest friends, as opposed to one friend and an overnight
&gt; &gt;bag in the Insight.
&gt; 
&gt; Well certainly not to jump on the Insight bandwagon but obviously
&gt; you aren't being fair George.

You're right, of course, but the second comparison (to the civic) was
quite fair.  Both vehicles were new, met current ULEV emission specs, etc.
Actually the comparison was a bit unfair to the Civic, since the Civic
carries two more people and has better performance.

&gt; You'd have to compare the Insight to
&gt; the cost of a new EV (dad's was out the door highly discounted but
&gt; still $28,5) new car for new van with all the warranty, features, etc.

Well, a fair comparison would be to a 2-seater of very modest power, which
VW doesn't make.

If hybrids are ever going to become
mainstream (and there are some very good reasons why they should) then
they will have to compete head-to head with conventional vehicles.

I really wouldn't be too surprised to find that the New Bus might be
planned for the hybrid drivetrain.  The body shape of the bus is very
flexible.
