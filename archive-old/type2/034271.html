Subject: Great Bus Tour - Merry Christmas

Merry Christmas Eve / Happy Holidays to all!

Julia &amp; I will have the great bus tour baton and case over christmas.
It has a proud prominent space under our tree!

Dallas Smith passed the baton to me on Wed.  I had a nephew and 2 nieces
that were checking out all of the fun stuff in the case.

Soooo.... I think I am supposed to take the baton half way to
charleston. (I may set up a visit to charleston and go all the way)

I e-mailed Leo the other day to try to get some SC e-mails.  I had not
recieved any tour e-mails since early Oct. until this past weekend.
I need to get in touch w/ some of the following folks: (from tour
webpage:http://www.excalibre_dot_com/bussin/great_bustour_.html)

Derek Waycaster - Charleston
Dave Jersey - Charleston
Joy McMahan - Greenville
Snoopy Waite - N. Charleston
Royce Keithley - N. Charleston

So please e-mail me and we can set up the next hand off.

happy holidays
michael
