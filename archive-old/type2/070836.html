Subject: Yikes! rear seal leak
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Looks like the 12mm bolt on the center fan hub of this 74 -1800 wants to keep 
loosening up - and it does as I drive around and around the block. the 3 
twelve point allen bolts as well to a lesser degree - might be because I 
don't have the exact size bolts I should or good enough points on the 
12-point bolt heads - wonder if this weird size fan hub hardware is available 
in an OEM plastic bag with one of those spacers at some parts warehouse - 
yeah - right!~. Really hope the threads in the cranks snout aren't beat - 
never heard of that yet. anyway the consequence of any driving with the fan 
loose is a loose fan belt, a shredded rear seal and an obscene sized oil leak 
- good thing I was still around town. Time to plan the next move....
