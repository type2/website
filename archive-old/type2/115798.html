&gt; I'm up in Canada so its a different system,  but I get hit with quite
&gt; the insurance bill, I pay $5,500.00 a year to insure my 2000 Subaru
&gt; Impreza and my 1973 Bus. Adding the bus to my policy actually doubled
&gt; my rate, my to my surprise.

The last time I insured in BC through ICBC (the govt's insurance corp), it
cost me $947 CDN annually for $15M (that's not a typo) liability to/from
work up to 15 km. I've over 25 with 40% discount for good driving record. I
wonder how much the rates have changed since then. BC is divided into
driving zones with Vancouver being the most expensive, naturally.
