Subject: Engine Stands

Well,

Here they are (not quite how I quoted it this morning but I guess that's
another sign of old age - my memory is really quite shocking......)

The JC Whitney catalogue I have only lists the 'bench mount' engine stand
for $29.98.  Catalog no. is 12DH2100B.  Fax order no. is 312-431-5625, phone
order no. is 312-431-6102

Latest Rage (uh, did I say SoCal?) offers a Bench Mount for $18.00 and a
'floor' model (which tears down for storage) for $40.00.  No catalog no.s.
Fax order no. is 310-404-5001, phone order no. is 310-404-5001

Rocky Mountain Motor works also offers a bench mount (part no. 30290) for
$24.95 and a floor model (which tears down, part no. 30288) for $69.95.
Toll free order no. is 1-800-258-1996

Now  I'm pretty damn sure that these are all the same units (pix look
identical).  All  the other 'VW'  tools offered by Latest Rage and RMMW
(flywheel lock, flywheel seal installer, ring compressor, oil filler nut
socket, oil pump puller etc) also seem to be the same thing.  In relation to
concerns about bending RMMW does offer a  lifetime 'quality'  warranty  in
the front of their catalog (which excludes normal wear and tear)........if
the thing bent  I think you'd have a pretty good case for return/credit on
the grounds of inferior quality?

I will probably buy the bench mount cos I have a nice heavy vice bench (on
wheels) that I can bolt it to...(I'll also probably weld a coupla really
ugly but functional braces onto it for good measure...)
