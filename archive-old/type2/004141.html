I need to replace the two rubber pieces on my 091 shift linkage. I have the
one that covers the guide pin on the rear shaft rod, however, I also need
the rubber boot right next to it on the gearshift shaft. VW made two
different size boots for this. Therefore, I need to get the tranny number
off it so I can get the right one. My problem is finding the number. Can
someone tell me where the physical location is of that number. I was
thinking about wire brush and carb cleaner the whole case to find it. But,
it would be nicer if I had a location to shoot for.

TIA
