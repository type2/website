&gt; How do you get at the bottom screw on the cold start valve?
&gt; I can't get a stubby screw driver in there, and a regular
&gt; screw driver can't get there either.
&gt; 
&gt; My bus is back on the road and working good as far as I
&gt; can tell. It now has a new fuel pump and the timing was
&gt; readjusted (was 10 degrees off). This seems to have cured
&gt; my lack of power hesitation problem on yesterday's test
&gt; drive.
&gt; 
&gt; I performed some more pressure testing of the fuel system
&gt; per Bentley. The pressure regulator checks out OK, but
&gt; there must be a leak in the system. I get 38 psi when I
&gt; pressure up the system with the starter or AFM flap, but
&gt; this pressure goes down to 10 psi or less in 30 secs to
&gt; 1 minute. According to either Probst or Bentley, the
&gt; pressure is supposed to remain above 14 psi for 20 minutes.
&gt; Something must be leaking, and I am guessing that it is
&gt; the cold start valve, but I can't get to that bottom
&gt; screw. Any other ideas as to why I am loosing pressure?

You're right, it's a bear. I usually can get it with a stubby phillips, 
but sometimes have to grab the screwdriver with a channellocks. Removing
the distributor will give you more room, and if you leave the clamp
attached to the distributor, the timing will remain the same. Just stuff
a rag in the distributor hole immediately to prevent the screw from
falling into the hole. Also, don't forget about the copper sealing
washer on the screw for the cold start injector.
Another thing to bear in mind is that ANY injector could be leaking,
they should all hold pressure.
If you find more than one leaking, I'd recommend some of the
pour-in-the-tank injector cleaner. I've had very little problems with
bad injectors and attribute this to my religious use of GASOHOL.
I think that the slightly solvent effect of the alcohol keeps the
varnish-like molecules in suspension and keeps the tank and injectors
clean. I've used it in all my injected VW's (6 or7 to date) and also my
69 double cab which is completely stock and probably would run on third
world fuel.
