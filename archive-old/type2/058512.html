My (professional) opinion on voltmeters:

Digital voltmeters are great. Very cheap and very accurate. I could not do
without one. For basic electric work on a bus (you're right abot turn
signals!) an analog meter is very handy too. Having two meters is even
better than having just one.  So be a big spender and buy a digital as well
as a (small)  analog meter.  I guess you can have both for a total of about
$20.

About the ranging: You just set the rane to the nearest higher setting from
what you expect. On a bus it means you set the analog meter most of the time
to the 20 volts DC setting. This means full scale is 20 volts. Half scale is
10 volts etc.

Be careful. If you set it too low (like 5 volts) and you measure a voltage
that is higher (like 12 volts) the needle will bang into the corner and it
could bend making the voltmeter inaccurate er even damaging it.
