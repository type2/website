Subject: Re: Fw: [T2] Re: Stranded, Ignition switch won't turn all the 
  way

On my split window buses and my late bays, the
cancelling dog is on the passenger side. To the right.

A 2nd problem may be that the column is down too far.
If the gap between the wheel and switch is too far
apart, the dog won't reach to cancel.

Only a slight annoyance, the turn signal canceling

working.
 
Is it possible that I put the steering wheel on 180
degrees off?
Probably should have marked it before removal. Is
the metal part that
sticks off the bottom of the steering wheel supposed
to go on the left
or right side. It's on the left right now, the side
with the turn
signal switch. Is this incorrect?
