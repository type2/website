&gt; 1600 dual port with alternator.  I just lost a

&gt; &quot;USA&quot; on it and was wrapped as bugpack).  I have
&gt; also had intermittent noise from the fan (I
&gt; think) that is made worse with any of the newer
&gt; style ribbed belts.

The correct belt for a stock upright is a Continental (conti-tech)
905x9.5.  Accept no substitutes, carry a spare!

It might be that the pulley was not properly tightened when the belt was
replaced.  Proper technique is to allow the pulley and engine to turn as
you tighten the nut.  Otherwise, you risk pinching the belt between the
pulley halves and having the pulley be loose after the engine turns and
pulls the pinched belt out.

I think that the stock pulleys are best, but I do like the aftermarket
&quot;dress up&quot; alternator pulley nut and washer.  The nut is a lot easier to
get a wrench on and it engages a lot more threads than the stock nut.

If the stock belt ends up being too loose, check the pulleys (did a PO
slip a &quot;power pulley&quot; on there?), the clamp on the alternator stand, etc.
With the pulley distance being fixed by the engine and stand it is awfully
hard for the belt to be too loose unless something changed.
