Subject: Re: [T2] overcautious rod install question

I looked at 2 sets and both have rod/cap #'s on the same side as the bump.
I'd say all #'s up.

&gt; they came out of my vw; they apear to be vw rods compared to those i've
&gt; seen both in books and around vw garages. none appear to be ground off - i
&gt; hadn't noticed they were on or off before i took them to get pin bushings.
&gt; at the machine shop i checked the new bushing for fit and noticed the they
&gt; had been through a parts washer, but not until i got home to assemble did
i
&gt; say to myself, gee wiz, no forge marks and no fresh-looking grinding on
the
&gt; rod. so i'm still at gee wiz - anybody on the all numbers up or down?   -
