Subject: Re: Re: [T2] Endplay Question

&gt;From: &quot;Dave C. Bolen&quot;

&gt;Yes, there will be a *lot* of play without the flywhell/flexplate/shims
&gt;installed.  The proper way to do this is to *read the manual* and
&gt;understand that you measure the first time with 2 shims on and then find
&gt;the correct thickness of shim to make the endplay come out where it is
&gt;supposed to(factory specs).
&gt;I can't stress how important this is to do correctly!


Thanks Dave Exactly the answer I was hoping for. My bentley was located this 
morning it is on the dash of my bus. It has now turned Blue! Sunlight. I 
couldn't find it lastnight so I started posting and my emails were getting 
worse and worse. I think I have both problems solved now. Thanks again.
