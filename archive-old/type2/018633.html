&gt; My questions are: can anyone verify the RV emission claim?

You might try your friendly local department of motor vehicle website.

If I may leech onto your question here, I went to have a smog check for my
74 Westie a couple of weeks ago &amp; the guy slapped a $59 &quot;motorhome&quot; charge
onto the bill. Fortunately the bus failed the test heroically &amp; I didn't
have to pay the charge. Does anyone know if this is legit in California?

(Hmmmm....maybe I should point my browser to my FLDMVW....)
