Glad to help :-)

&gt; Should I be looking for an 050? After reading a recent thread, I think 
&gt; switching back to FI is a bit beyond my learning curve right now. And 
&gt; I'm looking for any suggestions that make this rig more &quot;drivable.&quot; As 
&gt; is, my wife refuses to get behind the wheel and I can hardly blame 
&gt; her.

Get an SVDA from aircooled_dot_net, install it, and time it to 7.5 BTDC.

Lessee... I can never remember... is '75 1.8L or 2.0L?  Anyway, making 
sure the carbs are jetted properly for your engine size is important.  
Getting them properly synchronized is also key.

If you weren't leaving San Francisco, I would suggest you bring it on 
over to my place for the day... I'd be happy to try and help you get it 
running better.
