Subject: Hot Rod Calculator 2.0

&quot;Hotrodders and anyone who's curious about the
mathematics of their car's operation can easily calculat such
things as horsepower, torque, gear ratio, tire size, quarter
mile time, and much more&quot;

Kind of a fun little program. Particularly if math isn't your forte...
