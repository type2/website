Subject: Installing a Westfalia ceiling cabinet

Greetings,

Well, I've located a '79 Westy ceiling cabinet to put into my '78 bus. My
bus has a basic Westy conversion (all cabinets minus the ceiling and the
Z-mattress). In my excitement at finding the ceiling cabinet I never got
around to first finding out how to install it into my bus, or rather, IF I
can install it into my bus. I assumed that I could but something tells me I
shouldn't make assumptions regarding things I know next to nothing about.
So, can I install this ceiling cabinet into my bus and, if so, will it
require me (or someone much more qualified than me) to weld mounting
hardware onto the roof? Also, I don't have the wood roof trim, but rather a
headliner that has seen better days which I was hoping to cover up with the
ceiling cabinet. Is this possible?

Thanks for your time!

Steve

'78 bus

P.S. My bus is due to come out of the repair shop within the next few days
(fingers crossed--again)  after being there for nearly three months (!!!). I
still haven't even driven it yet. So, if the planets are aligned and I still
have some good karma left, a bus is about to hit the round after being left
for dead for two years. Woohoo!
