&gt; Listees,
&gt; With all the hot weather I decided to check and make sure my air flaps were
 opening correctly. Got under the '71 and took off the shroud, right side
 bottom and voila!, no thermostat. Should I be able to see flaps from there?
 How does the connection work? I've seen the '79 system with the cable etc
 but this is a mystery to me.

No, you can't see the flaps, but you should be able to see the flap
actuating rod extending down between the cylinders.  If the rod is there,
then the flaps are there.  Pull the rod down firmly and you might be able
to feel the flaps close.  They have a spring that keeps them open.  Some
backyard engineer might have wired the flaps open, so they might not move
when you pull the rod.

If the rod is missing, then your flaps might be missing.  Feel around the
front (FIF) of the fan shroud and see if you can feel the levers and
pushrods where the shroud meets the cylinder tin.  If you don't feel that,
your flaps have probably been removed.

You need to pull the engine to replace the flaps, but if the rod is still
there you can replace the thermostat with the engine in place.  Be sure to
adjust it correctly!
