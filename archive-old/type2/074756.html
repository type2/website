Subject: Nut Size??

Shame on all of you for your dirty thoughts about the subject line!! I'm talking about the nut that holds the steering wheel on in a bay window bus, Anyone know off hand what size this is and more importantly, anyone know if this is the same size as the same nut on a Super Beetle??  I'm guessing between 24-28 mm, but I can't fing this tidbit of info in ANY of my manuals and I don't want to buy the wrong size from the hardware store. 





Peace, John Baker
