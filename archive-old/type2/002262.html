&gt; Just to be clear, the 210 and 215mm flywheels and clutches will fit inside
all 72-79 bellhousings.  The 76-79 flywheels and clutches will only fit the
76-79 bellhousings.  I have heard that you can do some grinding on the 72-75
bellhousings and make the later flywheel and clutch fit, but I have never
tried it.  You can also bolt a 72-75 bellhousing to a 76-79 tranny with no
problems.  I am fairly sure that the starters are specific to the
bellhousings.


The starters are specific to the flywheel. The teeth on the 210-215 are in a
different spot than a 228. You have to use the longer starter drive pinion
on a 228 flywheel. The starter for the automatic flex disc/ring gear is
self-supporting and will work on the 210/215 flywheels but will not work on
the 228.


&gt; &gt;Oh...  and don't forget the exhaust system too. Even though the 79
&gt; &gt;2.0L engines have square port heads (one year exhaust), the 72-74
&gt; &gt;muffler fits fine (w/o Egr and Cat on my 79). 75-78 is the other
&gt; &gt;exhaust group, so this has to be considered too. (Busdepot's new
&gt; &gt;catalog is a great resource for students of bus exhaust).
&gt;
&gt; I wonder how the port mismatch affects power?  I'll admit it's probably
not a big problem, but I'd try to correct it eventually.

I believe he means to use the 72-74 muffler ON the 79 heater boxes. This
will work ONLY if it is a 79 Federal version exhaust. The 72-74 heater boxes
[except 74 w/EGR] and the 79 Fed boxes are the same except for the exhaust
ports.
