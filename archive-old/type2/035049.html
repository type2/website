Hi all, 

Well being unable to find any Spanish listees :(  i consoled myself by
buying a mini blow torch thing, with the idea of heating up the old
underseal and slowly scraping it off at the week end. Obvious thing apart
(errr fuel tank  :0)  what should i really not heat?
Any advice to prevent me killing myself and damaging the project
appreciated.

Darren
