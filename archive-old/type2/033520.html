Subject: Re: Whirring noise in back

Steve,
   Thanks for the response. I tried the heater lever and it didn't work. If 
you're talking about the electric blower in the engine compt. that's not 
installed yet. It's  a carburated(sp?) 2.0L so I don't know what else it 
could be. Any other Ideas? 
   The noise isn't quite like a fan noise either can't quite explain it 
though. Maybe more of a purr than a whirr? Not quite  but close to the sound 
of an air compressor running in the distance but a little faster. It makes 
the noise in both acc. and run if that helps.
Ed
