Subject: Aircooled vng fs in PA
Message-ID: &lt;0.99cc2ff8.2547af66_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I have an 83 aircooled vng that is body wise in great shape for a PA bus.  
The engine was in the middle of being of being rebuilt.  I just got rebuilt 
heads for it that I haven't had a chance to put on.  I am moving to MA soon 
and want only back what I have put into the vehicle.  I am asking $600, but 
that is not set in stone.  Email me, PaiFeef_at_aol_dot_com or call me at work from 
11am-7pm at 215-234-8989, and yes, that is the Bus Depot.
