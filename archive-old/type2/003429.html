&gt; &gt; If you're only going a short distance you can simply make the bed and
slide
&gt; &gt; the canoe in through the back.

The thing I like about doing that is that you can load all the gear in the
canoe before you leave for the lake/river.   Then when you get there all you
do is slide it right in the water and you're ready to go. When you get back
you do just the reverse, but I put a hunk of plastic over the upholstery.
I've been doing this for a couple years now.  For long distances, I just
throw it on the top (no rack), put a couple towels under where the canoe
rails touch the fiberglass, and tie the front and back to the bumper and tow
loops.  I've logged hundreds of miles with this setup at 55mph with no
problems.  I have a 16 ft canoe and, conveniently, it only rests on the
tough parts of the roof.  YMMV
