I go for 20w50 in the heat and 10w40 or
15w50 in the cooler months. it's all based on temperature.

&gt; Having survived a brush with engine death due to an oil related problem
&gt; I'm trying to avoid future problems of this nature. One question is Which
&gt; oil to use. Someone on the list reccomended 20w50 but another says just
&gt; say no to dino juice.  ??   The latter mentioned full synthetic oil but
&gt; I've heard not to use synthetic oil unless you do it from very early on in
&gt; the engines life.  ONE MORE QUESTION my oil cooler is hooked up to nothing
&gt; there is a port for a hose there where does it connect to??
