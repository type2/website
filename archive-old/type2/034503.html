Subject: Re: Click &amp; Clacks Worst Car List 

Well, as one with more than his fair share of crotchety Bostonian ancestors, 
( is there anything more stubborn than a Mc Donald)?  What turns my crank is 
the whole attitude of looking down their nose at you, and no, its not 
confined to click and clack. What I find on the list is a sense of help 
freely given, minus attitude (well, most times ) =;-) Shameles bus content, 
have decided to restore the 69 westy and might even keep the world paint job.
