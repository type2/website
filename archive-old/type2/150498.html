&amp;gt; What kind of pressure would the tank have to be under, so that that you
would get a consistent CFM at 90 PSI for most power tools? I know with my
60 (or is it an 80?) gallon compressor...  I have my regulator set to 90
psi because that's what all my power tools call for.

You have a point.  The nitrogen tank works for any intermittant tool,
such as an impact wrench.  It would be exhausted rapidly by a continuous
tool such as a paint sprayer or a die grinder.

Figure the tank holds something like 10 cubic feet at 2000PSI.  This would
translate to 200 cubic feet at 100PSI.  Take 200, divide it by the CFM
requirements of your tool, and you will have the running time in minutes.

Nitrogen tanks can't be beat for portability, but they don't replace a
compressor for long-term use.
