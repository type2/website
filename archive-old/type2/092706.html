Subject: Re: [T2] Overheating?

Starter solenoid or maybe the starter.

Nothing else to play with like hoses.

Pure electrical problem.

Nothing but the starter counts unless the engine is cranking over happily. 
That means the distributor, the fuel system, the whatever doesn't matter 
unless the engine is first spinning over.

Once the engine is spinning over gaily then you've got worry about ignition 
and fuel systems.

Why didn't you roll start the van - can be done on flat ground if you give 
it a good shove.

Point the bus right, turn the key on, brake off, in neutral, big push, jump 
in the open door, clutch in, 1st gear, pop the clutch!
