Subject: 1966 Bus questions.  By the stupid, for the stupid.

I have some questions about my newly aquired bus that I hope some of you 
more knowledgeable types can answer.

1.  The stock master cylinder was of a single design.  Can I purchase an 
aftermarket dual cylinder design which will fit?  The official VW repair 
guide for the 63 to 67 busses shows one and how to repair it.  This must 
have been on option.  Was it?

2.  I have heard talk about a vaccuum assist reservoir to aid in braking.  
Does my 1966 bus have one or is this only on 68-on busses?

3.  Seriously, what must be done to convert from 6 volt to 12 volt?  Can 
I buy a kit with instructions on how to do this?

4.  I have been told that there is a bracket that attatched to the rear 
of the engine to act as some kind of support.  When I go to put an engine 
in this bus, will I need that bracket?  If so, where does it go?  Can 
someone point me a picture of this in a mag or on the WEB someplace?
The engine has long since been pulled from this bus so I have to kind of 
guess and by golly everything.

5.  The lug pattern on the front of the bus resembled a chevy or mopar 5 
lug design.   The rears are still the stock 5 lug type.  Anyone have any 
idea why someone might have done this?

That's all I can think of right now.  I'll probably have more questions 
once I get to working on it.  Thanks for reading...

Slater!
