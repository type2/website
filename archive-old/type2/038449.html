Hi All
Tranny Lube changing time this spring. We'll be doing a two month, out west 
vacation
with a fully loaded westy this summer to include the Rockies, the major parks 
and some serious extended driving. 
Is the use of the Red Line MTL synthetic oil justified for (only) this year's 
heavy duty driving or is the dino GL4 best for all occasions and loads?
Has anyone used Red Line for over a year or two without ill effects?
P-mail only please, no threads. Archives and library not helpful.
Thank you.
Bucket
