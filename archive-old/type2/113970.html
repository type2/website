&gt;The oil temperature has me very very concerned. Simply a combination of a

&gt;something more worrisome?

Adventurewagens are heavy, but... 300 is out of line (and coming from me, Mr. high-oil-temps-are-okay, that should mean something!).  Assuming you didn't have your foot all the way to the floor going up the grade, you may have an airflow problem through the oil cooler.  This could be caused by crud accumulating on top of the cooler, flap/thermostat problems, or engine tin sealing problems.

&gt; Did I do permanent damage to Bertha's engine (she
&gt;'sounds' normal now)?

If she sounds normal, you are probably okay but a couple of things could give you more info.  An oil analysis (of the oil that was in the bus when it hit 300) and an oil pressure gauge.  If your oil pressure has dropped since before the trip, then you know you are in trouble.  If this was my bus, I would be running synthetic oil and thinking hard about what to do to lower those oil temps.
