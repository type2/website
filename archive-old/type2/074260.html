Subject: Re: [T2] generic cd in a bus question

Sure they do most cd players will function at almost any angle, i have mounted
them
in some very odd places in various cars at some very odd angles. Most auto cd
players grip the disk. I have had a cd player in my bus for 5 years now.
jamie

&gt;   do cd players work at that
&gt; angle?  - steve
