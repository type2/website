Subject: Alternator wiring harness?

Hi VWer's,

  I am in desperate need of a wiring harness for my alternator.  Can't
seem to find where to buy one, so I tried to make my own, which is
evidently not working.  If someone could let me know where to go to get
one, I would really appreciate it.

  Thanks,
    Wade
