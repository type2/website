Subject: mod to a full flow system

I have a Berg full flow oil system and want to eliminate the stiff 
braided steel lines that connect the oil filter and case.

Although I am a complete novice as far as hose fittings are 
concerned, if I stare at the pieces that come with the Berg kit, I see
two hoses with female AN fittings (AN 8, I think)  on their ends,
fittings that convert the AN to a male NPT, and
NPT taps in the case and the oil fiter holder.

Suppose I choose the AirCooled_dot_net 350 hose to carry the oil.

I could use this if I could find fittings that had an NPT thread on 
one end and a barb on the other that was compatible with the ID of 
the hose.

My questions are: Has anyone made this conversion?  Anyone know a 
source of the NPT/barb fittings? I've looked through several 
industrial supply catalogs and don't see them.

Thanks, jack
