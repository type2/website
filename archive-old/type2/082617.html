Subject: Re: [T2] engine putts when in idle

kinda sounds like hunting. You might have a vacuum leak. An easy way
to check is to spray small amounts of starter fluid at connection
points (such as throttle or intake tube seals) and see if the engine
speed increases.

&gt; My 1978 stock engine putts, loses power, as if it is going to die, then 
&gt; regains itself, when in idle.  Any ideas as to what the problem,(if any) this 
&gt; may be?  Thanks
