Yes that is what I meant!  Sorry, I cannot proof-read my own stuff!

I will try swapping the brake pads.  

I hope it is not the bearings, supposedly they were checked and are ok. 
They are also just about 2 years old and the car seems to track just
fine when coasting.

I will save a copy of your comments and check with the guys that worked
on it.  Maybe it is a front end thing, though that is new within the
last 2 years also; maybe I wacked a hole in the road real hard and don't
remember it!

Thanks,

Lauria
