As Karl pointed out, I erred:
&gt;&gt;Alas, my 68 camper seems ancient compared to yours with almost 14,000 made 
&gt;&gt;between ours.  Mine is 238-113969 &lt;&lt;
I *meant* to say mine seems young...

&gt;&gt;Mine is 238-025840, sadly she is feeling her age at the moment &lt;&lt;
But Tammy's is truly ancient by comparison.  Do they sell Geritol for old 
campers in the UK?  =)
