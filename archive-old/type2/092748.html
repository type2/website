Subject: 76 2liter won't idle

I can't get my newly rebuilt 76 two liter to idle without stalling. It 
starts and will run fine at half throttle and can even be kept running at 
that higher speed until it warms up. But when I take my foot off the 
accelerator (slowly) and let it slow down, it begins to run roughly, and 
then it stumbles and progressively slows down and stops, over about 4 
seconds . Flooring the pedal in this phase has no effect. Once it starts 
this downward path, it will stall. Restart is just fine, and I can go 
through it all again.

While looking for vacuum leaks, I discovered that I can keep the engine 
running at idle by supplying a moderate stream of propane into either the 
air metering valve or into the exhaust gas recirculator fitting near 
cylinder 4.(I can seal the opening of this fitting  with a strip of tape, 
to cross it off as a vacuum leak.)   So, I think that demonstrates that the 
idle mixture is too lean and is responsible for stalling at idle.  Setting 
the by-pass air screw on the air metering valve at full rich has not 
affected the idle stalling. The setting of the idle screw on the throttle 
body is equally ineffective.

My conclusion is that the mixture is not rich enough at idle to sustain 
combustion. That can mean not enough fuel being injected, or too much air 
being admitted.

Since adding fuel (propane) results in an adequate idle, I think the fault 
is in whatever is controlling the amount of fuel being injected. I am 
guessing that the air metering valve is the guilty party, somehow. Any 
comments about this condition will be appreciated.

I did check the deceleration valve by trying to blow air through it when 
the engine was off. I disconnected the big hose from the air-intake duct 
(&quot;S&quot; hose past the air metering box)and I could puff into it and blow air 
into the deceleration valve. I guess I could have applied a vacuum there, 
but I didn't. Seems to me that valve should be closed. Comments appreciated.

Incidently, I observe that the auxiliary air regulator is not bolted in 
place, but is secured only by the two hoses and the electrical pigtail.  I 
took it off and looked through it and could see that it was open. My 
specific question about it concerns the continuity of the electrical 
connection......does the unit designed to maintain its ground connection by 
being bolted to the engine, or is the pigtail self-contained, bringing both 
a hot feed and a ground to operate the device? I have a schematic, but am 
too electrically illiterate to feel confident interpreting it. 
I  considered grounding it with a jumper wire to test the result, but since 
I am writing this, I can probably just ask.

It has two bolt holes in it, and I know it _should_ be bolted to the engine 
somewhere near the airbox, and in that location it gets warm when the 
engine gets warm, and it then closes off its auxiliary air. Any comments 
about this valve will be appreciated.

That is a whole basket of observations and questions. I know some of you 
will consider it child's play. But to me it is pretty puzzling.
