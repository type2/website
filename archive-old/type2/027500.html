Hey y'all
Chris reminded me that there's more to life than just Chili (though I'm 
unsure if it's true).  He does bring up a good point, side dishes will be 
more than welcome.  I propose we add a third cztegory - best side dish!

Hi Chris!
What a great reminder about side dishes.  I get so excited about the Chili I 
forget the other 'essentials'.  I hope you're coming, bring the family, your 
appetite, and most certainly chili or a sidedish.

What about other dishes besides chili?&gt;
&gt;Slaw f'rinstance, or even cornbread.&gt;&gt; Salsa.&gt;
&gt;And let's not forget Margarita (hmmm...)&gt;&gt;
