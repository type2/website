Try carb cleaner, and spray it at the base of the manifolds.  I wouldn't
aim the gas into the air cleaner if there is any kind of mass airflow meter
present (maybe yours doesn't have one - I don't know squat about FI).  May
damage it.  Could damage a throttle position sensor too, if your bus has
that.

The acceleration should be significant.  Negative acceleration, in my case.
When I tried this with vacuum leaks, it darned near killed the motor.
