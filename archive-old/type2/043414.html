&gt; except maybe for automatics, it helps

actually automatics need less room to take out, bucause you disconect the
torque convertor from the flex plate (Clutch and flywheel, replacements)
and essentially have a straigt drop.  the furtherest you have to pull it
back is to clear the lower mount studs
  just have to make sure the oil pump shaft stays in, or push it back in
before you start lowering since this shaft is easy to damage.

any you think lining up the tranny splines is difficult, try getting that
torque convertor lined up with the flex plate, and the first bolt in!

&gt; in this situation, since the intention is to get the
&gt; trans out, try this: leave the cv joints attached,
&gt; disconnect the shifter, remove the trans mount bolts,
&gt; lower the assembly and slide the engine out with
&gt; the trans supported, then remove the trans.

in an automatic (and I don't know what you have) the tranny is much
heavier than a manual tranny, much heavier!

but unless you are removing the tranny then you don't have to disconnect
any of the linkages (except tranny to motor accelerator, unique to autos
so don't look for it on a manual)  to lower the rear a short distance.
generally if you don't have to remove the CV joints you don't need to
remove the shift linkage.  Another difference is the front tranny mount is
different on an Automatic too!
