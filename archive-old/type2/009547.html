&gt;         Yes, I said that, and the two '81 engines I have both have only
&gt;one vacuum port, but I see in looking at the dizzy chart in Bentleys
&gt;that other years definitely have two -- but my FI setup has no other
&gt;port for two.
&gt;

All Calif. 79 buses and 80-83.5 Calif. Vanagons use dual vacuum units. [they 
are also electronic ignition :)]
You can tee into the line going to the pressure regulator to get manifold 
vacuum for the retard side.
