Subject: Starter Dummy!

I am completely embarrassed to admit it, but I can't get the starter off my
72. I was told that there is a long bolt that goes thru to the engine
compartment, but where? I have looked everywhere for it with no luck? Can
someone please point me in the right direction? Thank you in advance.

Happy Fathers Day to all you Dad's out there, enjoy!
