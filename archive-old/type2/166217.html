Subject: Re: [VB] Eating clutch cables...help ? - sorted

I pulled the lever from the frame this morning to find the short arm to 
have been put on the wrong way - doh!  that was the breakdown guy on the 
first snap.

So I just put it back on the right way and filed a little more material 
from the cable clevis to give it a little more movement if required.  
Fastened it all up and the clutch feels ten times better, much lighter now.

Cheers all

&gt; Thanks for all the tips guys.
&gt;
&gt; The first time the cable went (probably just down to age) I had to 
&gt; call out a garage as I had my baby with me and couldn't fix it on the 
&gt; road.  It snapped at the tranny end.
&gt;
&gt; I recall the AA guy removed the small lever from clutch pedal end and 
&gt; I guess he's gone and put it back the wrong way as I've snapped three 
&gt; at the front end since then.
&gt;
&gt; I'll get under tomorrow and take a look!
&gt;
&gt; thanks again, I'm pretty sure this will be the problem.
