Subject: Corvairs &amp; VW Police trucks

It wasn't a truck, but about 15 years ago I spent a summer in Germany and
stayed with some people that had a retired police van.  Maybe it was because
of the autobahns, but it felt more powerful than your average van, even with
seven people on board!

&gt;&gt;But it wasn't a VW, I don't think, but looked very much like a bay-window.
&gt;&gt;Anyone know any more?  Might be an interesting conversation piece.
&gt;
&gt;I dunno about Chinese vans, but when I was in the Caribbean a 
&gt;few years back I noticed quite a few of those Daihatsu vans
&gt;(Japanese, not chinese, I know...) But anyway, they looked 
&gt;eggzactly like a shrunken-up Vanagon.  Seated seven relatively
&gt;friendly folks, about as long (outside) as a Honda Civic. They
&gt;were almost as cool as the little British Mokes seen everywhere
&gt;.  I wanted to bring one of 'em home!!!
