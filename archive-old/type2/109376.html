&gt; I want to buy your fabs, but am worried that I will need to pay $40.00 a
piece for these defroster vents.  I have had things fabbed in the past for
non VW projects and it almost always is a bundle...

$40.00 each?  I'd hazard a guess at $42.00 per _set_ of vent inserts, let's
say $45.00 with USPS Priority Mail shipping.  (Man, I have got to get the
shipping calculator in place and running!)  Does this sound good to you?

I understand about the cost factor.  Most folk don't understand that casting
is akin to building a car by hand with hand-tools.  It's the design and
labor that increase the cost of the &quot;designer&quot; part, not usually the avarice
of the caster.

(Which is why I'm so careful about honoring copyrights.  A caster might put
hundreds or thousands of dollars into producing a product, only to have a
bootlegger rip off the design by buying one of the product and making a
large number of counterfeits from it.)
