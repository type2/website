Well, yeah, maybe $200 in parts is reasonable.... But, then again I didn't
do the work myself. Brakes are something that if you don't get right the
first time, there may be no second chance. I didn't feel comfortable doing
it myself.

I had the entire brake system replaced, from the rubber pad on the pedal to
the drums - and everything in between. master cyl, all lines, calipers,
shoes, all new. I think $1200 was money well spent for an all new system
especially as I don't have the time to do this big of a job myself. (Plus my
neighbors freak out when I change the oil...I'd hate to see them if they saw
my bus up on blocks on the sidewalk)

$1200 would be the high cost if you had everything on the system replaced, I
think. I have refurbed several brake systems, never spending over $200. I
have not had to replace brake boosters, drums, or discs; but I've had to
replace front calipers, pads, and lines and I *know* that cost was
under/around $200. Parts only. I did the work myself.

Good luck! Joe
