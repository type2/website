wow, who's doing the rebuild that sounds awefully high

&gt; debt 2k dollars to my parents. However, I found a 69

remember there are some major differences between a 69 and a 78.

&gt; bus in very good condition and many many more features
&gt; then the one I have now for only 1500.  So now I want
&gt; to sell the 78.  Would that be the right decision,

only you can decide if it is the right decision for you.

some things to consider.
.  you know what you have in the 78
.  your 78 will have a new engine, you might get 10 years or 10 days out
of the 69
.  you have already started figuring out the 78, you will start over with
the 69
.  the 69 is simpler and has a carb vs the FI on the 78

good luck
Bob
