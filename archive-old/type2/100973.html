&gt; &gt;I am not sure where someone came up with the idea that GE is a 1979 California
&gt; &gt;engine. I have seen that at 2 places. It is totally wrong. GE means it has
&gt; &gt;hydraulic lifters. Hydraulic lifters came out in 1978. These are all GE

just looked at my birth cert for my 78 federal bus and it also has listed
a GE engine
