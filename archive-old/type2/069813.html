Subject: Can't get strobe light working

I'm trying to time my '71 Westy but can't get my brand new Sears strobe light
to work on the bus.  I know the strobe light works in general because when I
hook it up to my '94 Nissan pickup and attach to number 1 plug wire it works
fine.  Is this a common problem because of the insulation on the Bosch plug
wires or am I just being ignorant?
