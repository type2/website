Subject: Re: [T2] Soft Brakes?

Good point. I guess I was making the assumption that the 1970's driver was 
as disconnected from his/her vehicle's maintenance requirements as now 
where a majority of the population can't even check the oil... &lt;grin&gt;

I can't even imagine having a trustworthy economical mechanic. One or the 
other - not both! &lt;grin&gt; (Just teasing really)

&gt; &gt; Wouldn't Vanagon drums do the job (I mean the self adjusting gig?)
&gt;
&gt;Having had self-adjusting drums on other vehicles, I prefer to adjust
&gt;myself.  It is easier to do an adjustment every few months than it is to
&gt;try and troubleshoot and repair a self-adjuster that isn't working.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Amazing that as late as the end of the 70's a mainstream car manufacturer
&gt; &gt; was putting non-self adjusting brakes on a mid-priced vehicle.
&gt;
&gt;There seemed to be an expectation that the VW owner would pay attention to
&gt;maintainance.  Little touches like small oil capacity, manual valves, etc.
&gt;seem to give that impression.  A visit to your friendly VW dealer for
&gt;regular service would get all these things checked and adjusted and it was
&gt;actually economical to do it this way.  These days it seems to cost a
&gt;C-note to take a modern car into the service bay and several more C-notes
&gt;to remove it regardless of the work done!
