Subject: Mosquito Screen Replacement?

Greetings Bussers:

Reading the recent posts about window screens got me thinking (again) about
replacing the front screen in my pop-top canvas (79 westy).  My canvas is
in excellent condition, but the screen has become very brittle over the
years and now is showing some large tears.  I'd like to replace the screen,
but don't want to mess with the canvas.

Has anyone done this?  Is there and easy way to do this?  Details would be
helpful.
