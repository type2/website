&gt;Load range is simply a maximum weight that a tire can carry in a given

&gt;size.  The bad news is that that maximum weight varies from size to size.
&gt;
&gt;Sidewall stiffness results directly from the sidewall construction, which
&gt;is a function of the pressure that the tire is designed to hold.  Higher
&gt;load ranges hold higher pressures and have stiffer sidewalls.
&gt;
&gt;You can't go wrong with a 185R14 in load range C or D.  Lots of excess
&gt;capacity and nice stiff sidewalls.  It's the size specified by VW.  It's
&gt;available.  There is little reason to experiment.


Since 1996, the Bridgestone RD603 LT tires seem adequate to me.
185R14, 8-ply rating, load range D, 1850lbs _at_ 65psi.
Tread plys = 2 steel, 2 polyester, 2 nylon.
Sidewall plys = 2 polyester.
I bought a pair last fall for $76/ea., mounted and balanced.  FWIW
