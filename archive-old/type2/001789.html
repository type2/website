Hey list,
    Well, I've finally come to the realization that I've neither the money
nor time to restore
my 1971 Bus. So, I've decided to put it up for sale. I've put up a webpage
to hopefully
answer any questions you may have. It also allows you to view a few pictures
of it.
Check out: http://www.angelfire_dot_com/il/hobbystuff/vwforsale.html
    For whatever reason, if you don't want to check out the webpage, a quick
description:
1971 bus, walkthrough cab, rebuilt motor with less than 200 miles, body has
a little rust
but it's not ate up. Asking $850.
Located near Bloomington, Illinois.
Thanks,
John Cummings
