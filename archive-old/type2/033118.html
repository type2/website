John,

There are two sources of noise getting into your radio, radiated and coming in
the antenna, conducted and coming through the power lines.   One thing that you
might do is determine if it's the christmas lights or the inverter.   You
mentioned that they are not blinking, so I'm going to guess that the root cause
is from the inverter.  If you want to check, run an extension cord out to the
bus and run the lights off of house power while running the radio and see if it
goes away.

I think you are going to find that the problem is with the light and inverter
combination working together to make a real nice transmitting antenna for the
inverter.  The inverters that you can buy almost anywhere are not SINE WAVE
inverters.  They are stepped square wave and very crude ones at that.  Usually
they accomplish from 0 to Max in 2-3 steps, Max to 0 in the same 2-3 steps and
then the repeat the  process for 0  to Min.  This square wave stepping is the
root of the problem.  Then inadvertently, you have compounded it by plugging the
christmas lights into it which essentially end up being a BIG transmitting
antenna for your inverter.

I could now launch into a dissertation on Fourier Analysis and the frequency
composition of a stepped square wave signal, but since this is a bus list, I'll
keep it short.  The square waves are generating what is know as harmonic
frequencies.  These are multiples of the original power line frequency (60 Hz)
and extend well up into the AM and FM broadcast region.  I am guessing that you
are not only messing up your radio, but anybody's radio within at least a car
length of you.  (You may have hit on a way to silence those annoying boom-boom
mobiles).

Radio Shack made a low pass/interference filter for filtering out junk caused by
CBs.  Try and find one of those and insert it BETWEEN the inverter and the
christmas lights.  What this should do is filter out some of the harmonics and
cause your power to move a little closer to a sine wave and may help a little
bit.  This may not give you Peace on Earth, but it may help a little.
