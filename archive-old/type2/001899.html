Just a note to let you know that you can now order using MasterCard and Visa
directly from the website shopping-cart.  This is via a fully secure,
encrypted server.

You need only provide your credit card number one time (either via the
website, or even by phone if you prefer).  After that, you need not enter
the numbers again (unless your card number or address has changed).  You can
simply check off a box telling us to bill the same card (and ship to the
same address) that you used previously.

Of course, you can still pay via Cybercheck (Check-by-Phone) instead, and
receive a 2% price break for paying that way (automatically reflected as a
reduction in the shipping-and-handling charge).
