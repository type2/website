&gt; i decided to do some holiday upgradeing on my bus. was going to install
&gt; my new oil pressure/temp guages, not that i need them in this weather.
&gt; just another thing to get out of the way befor summer. Anyway, the new
&gt; VDO sender dosent fit in the hole in the cooling tin that the old one
&gt; came out. It is significantly bigger then the other sender. Will i have
&gt; to cut the tin? Did i get the wrong sender? or am i missing something,
&gt; the bottom part of the sender is a little (not much) bigger then the
&gt; top, was it designed this way to be more air tight? or what is going
&gt; wrong here? the thread's look the same, except the new one is a bit
&gt; longer.
