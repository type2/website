Subject: Just went shopping...

Empi CV Boot Kits: $8.99 each (bought 4)
Luciflex (!) brake hoses: $13.99 each (bought 4)
Exhaust manifold studs: $1.98 each (bought 4)

While I'd bet the quality of the BD parts is superior, I won't have to
wait for shipping since I'm on a bit of a time crunch here.

As long as it stays dry, guess what I'll be doing tomorrow? LoL! 

Tonight I'm going to pull the muffler off and hit it with a wire wheel
to get rid of the rust then spray some black header paint on it. Maybe
get a few more months of life than otherwise. LoL! I'll put it back on
tomorrow after installing the exhaust studs and the correct HEs
(replacing the 411 exchangers that are on there).

Anybody want my Type 4 car (411) exchangers? They were like new when I
installed them a few months ago, though I don't know what they look
like now...
