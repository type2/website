Subject: Re: [T2] Wiring HELP!

&gt; I have never seen a 1968 or 1969 bus, and I have had both and torn
&gt; into others, that matched the wiring diagram. The Bentley wiring
&gt; diagram shows a nine pin E-flasher similar to the 67 set up but I
&gt; have yet to see one. All the e-flashers connections are built into
&gt; the switch and run through the 4 prong flasher relay. Additionally,
&gt; the brake lights are run through the e-flasher switch for reasons
&gt; that become obvious when you really get into it. Try and follow the
&gt; circuit numbers on the diagram and  look for the matching numbers on
&gt; switches and bulb holders on your bus.

Exactly
Get the 69-70 diagram from vintagebus
that should be a lot more like it

I assume that there are some very early 68s out there with the 9 pin
flasher box but I havent seen one either
