Subject: RE: tank straps

&gt; my tank straps have been cut by the previous owner, i have nicknamed him
&gt;bonehead.   he never came up with an alternate solution to the problem
&gt;except for two very old bungee cords.   i know this isnt safe.  what 
should
&gt;i do to fix this.

Same here except only one was cut. I used galvanized pipe strapping from 
the hardware store. Very handy stuff to carry in your spares kit with the 
duct tape and bailing wire. I also carry a half dozen 3&quot; long full thread 
bolts and nuts. With those you can really tighten up the pipe strapping 
when using it.
