Subject: RE: [T2] Alt. Failure Rate

&gt; Greetings. Was wondering what the expected life span (MTBF) of a rebuilt
&gt; Bosch 55amp. alt. was. Put one in my ' 78 Westy four months ago, and just
&gt; lost one of the three diodes in the pack today. The original alt.
&gt; lasted 105k  mi. Do the rebuilds from Bosch suck, or did I just get a bad
one?


I have not noticed a problem with them.  The defective return rate has been
low (maybe 1-2 a year).
