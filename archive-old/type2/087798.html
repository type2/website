Subject: RE: [T2] waxing philosophic

At 22 years old, I have to agree with Billy that some of the youth today
are grateful for the advice that you pass on to us.  In '98 I purchased
my first vehicle and my first house.  Saying that, you could not pry my
bus out of my hands either at this point.  One of my favorite things to
do on a weekly basis is pull out the dwell/tach and timing light and
tweak with the engine.  I would not be able to do half of the stuff I do
to my engine without the knowledge that has been past on from the elders
of this hobby and I appreciate that.

Steve,

Just think how those of us who are in our mid 20's and share your
&quot;do-it-myself&quot; ethic feel. How do you think we fit in with our
generation?

The days you guys reminisce about were gone decades before I got my
first bus. You have first hand knowledge of barndoors. I hope someday
I'll be able to find a nice T1 bus of any year.

Some of today's youth IS smarter, and will have to have our busses pried
out of our hands as well.

Thanks to all of you who pass the wisdom on to the next crowd. We are
listening.

Billy
