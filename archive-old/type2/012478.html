Subject: Westy sunvisors

&gt;permanently attached at the inside (by the mirror) but I've since found that
&gt;not all Busses came that way.  
&gt;
&gt;If your problem relates to the outer pivot, there is probably only 1 correct
&gt;way to screw them in and if you get the pivot mount upside down (180 degrees
&gt;off) the pivot angle will run you into the roof.


I just found some useable visors at the wreckers and put them on
my 70 westy.  They too, are attached at the inside point.  What
I did notice is that my originals had a spacer piece that matched
the outer pivot oval and seemed to 'raise' the outer pivot out
over the wood panels and would allow them to be pivoted with ease.
The spacers had a VW part # (sorry, didn't write it down) and 
were not present on the donor bus (71 kombi, ie. no wood panels)
Can any other Westy owners confirm this piece?

Funny, although I have this spacer,  the visors I took off didn't
pivot.  They were attached at the inside point, albeit broken,
hence the need for replacement.
