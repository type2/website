Subject: Re: [T2] Vanagon block into a bay (was: vanagon seats &amp; more)

Steve,

So you're telling me that if you stick your head into the engine 
compartment and look in front (FIF) of the fan housing where it meets the 
block, that seam matches exactly all the way across?  No gaping hole there 
where the curves diverge?  I have a very clear recollection of a problem in 
this area.  I guess it's possible that they changed the case, I think mine 
was an '81.

&gt;I have a vanagon short block running in the '73 right now.  As Dave
&gt;Wolfanger said, it requires a pretty total accesory flop and you wind up
&gt;with two dipsticks, but the only major dif was that the engine hanger
&gt;mount bolts on the Vanagon block were bigger (m10 vs. m8?) as David
&gt;Schwarze said.  I had no trouble with the shroud meeting the case at all.
&gt;This was an '80 case, for the record.  Maybe they changed the casting in
&gt;81 or 82?
