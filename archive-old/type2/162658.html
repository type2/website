&gt; What else do I need to consider changing or servicing.

oil filter
air filter
check lights (don't forget backup light)
windshieldwipers (new blades)
do the locks work


&gt; Also, what is the size of screw that holds the points in the distributor?
&gt; The hole is stripped out and I am trying to figure out how to remedy that.
&gt; bigger screw, lock washer, lock-tite??
&gt; any thoughts

try one of the points eliminator systems...
