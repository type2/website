Thanx guys :) unfortunately no, the wedding will not involve my bus even
though thats what I always wanted.  Bus is in my garage with brake probs and
leaking axle seals :(  (thanx anyway ronnie)
Wanted to make her a 100,000km VW badge wedding ring but she wouldnt go for
it. lol
    Good news about the AIRS site though... just a got a signup from North
Dakota!!!!!!!! (FINALLY!)
we now have ALL 50 STATES with members!!! Also in the LAST 5 DAYS, I have
received 53 NEW SIGN-UPS! Which also means we now have over 600 members.
Guess due to the incident, the word has spread about AIRS like never before.
I will be updating when I get back on monday/tuesday. The Kristin incident
had no negative effect on the AIRS site except for one guy who wanted his
last name removed, which was also the same guy who was on some kind of AIRS
strike a while back threatning to remove his name if I kept the list public.
So besides that, things are looking good for the site and you can now travel
anywhere in the US with at least some sort of contact. Thanks to all members
and to everyone who sent me positive input and ideas

I think ill change &quot;Coffee/talk&quot;  to  &quot;STOP BY FOR ANY REASON&quot; so people
know the AIRS site is not just for emergencys in some cases
Charlie- ill try to come in type2 chat monday night and talk with you - see
you then
