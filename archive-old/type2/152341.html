Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Help - shipping a bus from the US to Europe

We had hoped to have enough Ghias to ship over there to justify building a
structure inside a shipping container to enable 6 Ghias to fit in but
there only ended up being 2 of us so we elected to go the easy route with
RoRo (roll on, roll off).

Your Fiat idea reminds me of the time I flew up to Seattle to help my
sister-in-law to move back down to the Bay Area. At the time lots of
people were moving up to Seattle so she got this super cheap truck rental
because they needed it back down in California. The truck was so big that
after we put all her stuff in it was only 1/3 full. So I suggested we
put her Bug in there as well. The hard part was finding ramps to load and
unload it. We ended up finding a loading dock along a railroad spur.

&gt; Man, bet building the crate was a pain!!! &lt;grin! just kidding&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I SERIOUSLY considered sending a Fiat 500 back from Italy with my household goods - disassembled of course for parts...
&gt;
&gt; Been kicking myself ever since...
