Subject: ball joint

I need to get a ball joint pressed into one of the torsion arms on my 
'78.  I understand its not exactly a straightforward matter for a 
machine shop to do this. Is this correct? Can anyone recommend 
someplace in Connecticut, hopefully near Madison, who would be able to 
do this.
