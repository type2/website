My personal experience with MOFOCO concerned a trans for a 1980 Vanagon . Now 
this was a &quot;Remanfactured&quot; trans with a 12/12 warranty. At 13,000 miles and 
less than a year and a half  The unit began to first whine then scream. 
Getting the opinion of a VW trained mech confirmed a bad main pinion bearing. 
Now I understand that I was out of waranty but here is the problem; One would 
presume that a reman of any mechanical unit would involve both a visual as 
well as a instrument check on some of the more vital pieces aka bearings , 
syncros , gears . It seemed pretty obvious that a visual check was done all 
right, one of the outside of the trans case !  To add insult to injury ,there 
was no dealing with these folks. They would hear and have none of it, sticking 
firmly to the position that I was out of warranty and that was that.  I have 
other VW friends that have had bad experiences with mofoco. Personally I would 
not deal with them again. Just my .02

&gt;MOFOCO sent me a shipment of bad parts once.  I sent them back 
&gt;along with a written explanation of the problems (used parts sold 
&gt;as new, rebuilt parts that were out of specs, etc.) and gave them 
&gt;a second chance.  They blew that second chance as well a third and 
&gt;fourth.  As a result, I don't deal with MOFOCO and loudly
&gt;encourage others to do likewise.

Speaking of which, did anybody else see the article in the latest 
GASS (German Air Suckers Society) newsletter regarding a Mofoco 
rebuilt engine? It was written by a VW shop which installed a 
Mofoco engine for a customer.  While he did not mention Mofoco by 
name, he dropped enough hints to (purposely) make it clear that 
Mofoco was the culprit.  The engine they sold him, according to the 
article, was utter garbage. It was sold as a 1600 dual-port but was 
actually a much older motor machined to accept dual-port parts.  
Several of the studs pulled straight out of the motor within a few 
hundred miles. Parts that were supposed to be rebuilt clearly had 
never been touched, or were sloppily installed.  He goes on and on, 
indicating that the motor basically fell apart almost immediately 
upon installation, and Mofoco was so unwilling to stand behind it 
(did not even respond to a registered letter outlining his 
complaint) that he finally chalked it up as a total loss and 
rebuilt one for his customer himself. 
This article detailed a VW horror story.  I have never had a really 
bad experience with Mofoco myself, but after reading this article, 
if it is even half true, I'd never touch their motors.
