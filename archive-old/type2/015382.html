Sell the gas chassis and buy a diesel chasis. Conversion adds a great deal
of extra expensive parts, like a fuel tank and the spezial oil pan and
pickup tube and spezial manifolds and spezial motor mounts, and adds a good
30% to 50% to the labor time compared to a new diesel long block with reman
injectors and pump replacement in an existing diesel vehicle. I suggest
that a proper conversion from gas to diesel would be at least $2000 more
than the cost of stock diesel replacement. 

Now if you got a rusted out diesel chassis with good running gear, tank,
mounts, yadayadayada, and a gas chassis with a bad motor, you might be able
to do a conversion at much less cost. Note the the diesel tranny will be
needed unless you want less than optimum drivability and longevity due to
the ratios being matched to the diesel power/torque characteristics. When
cost of maintenance and fuel are considered, you just can't beat a diesel
Westy.
