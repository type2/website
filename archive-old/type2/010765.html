Subject: Burning a quart of oil a day...

--part1_20.1a01492a.2898822a_boundary

My bus burns a quart of oil every day.  I don't really want to rebuild the 
engine but I know I need to.  Everyone tells me that rebuilding an engine is 
really hard, and a lot of work.  Would it be more reasonable to put a new 
engine in, that is newer and more powerful engine in or rebuild mine?
