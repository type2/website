Re-Greetings*
  Been somewhat immersed in the pains and joys of moving from an apt. to a 
house, and have caught myself neglecting Ramona.
  Went and bought a fuel pump when she began to hesitate and I noticed a real 
lack of power. Next day she was a hard start; whirl, whirl, whirl, then 
catch. I had a looksee and the pump cover was leaking a bit from the top 
right side.
  That convinced me that my notion was right on, until I read about the 
accel. pump in the Bentley (thanks to Dave : ), which might show similar 
symptoms. So I suppose I should check that first since there is still the 
possibility that the fuel pump leaks from my removing the screen for 
cleaning...
  Any advice when checking the accel. pump? Also, I read a lot about the push 
rod under the fuel pump and all accounts seem to blame bad pumping on it. My 
new one doesn't come with a new rod?? Also, someone wrote that I would 
require specific torquing to replace the fuel pump, and I don't have a torque 
wrench...this cannot be a good guess?
  OK, well, again, any aid is surely appreciated!
