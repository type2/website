&gt; Do you know what the E in EFI stands for?
&gt; Electronic Fuel Injection.

the Fuel Injection system unique parts  would be

.  ECU
.  AFM
.  injectors
.  cold start valve
.  aux air valve
.  thermo time switch
.  engine temp sensor

but the carbs have

.  complex linkages
.  jets
.  accel pumps
.  choke heaters 
.  chokes
 etc

some things are there but different, but fuel pumps and relays and wiring
harnesses are in even the old 1300 engine splitties

&gt; Without the double relay and the engine harness, EFI will not run. They are as
&gt; much a part of EFI as a camshaft is to an engine.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;.....lots of bad
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; memories and what have I realized?  I have NEVER had the K-jetronic fuel
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; injection on any of my VW's ever bring me to a halt.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; In the past 7 years I have had two EFI failures that brought me to a halt.
&gt; 1st
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; neither one was a FI problem both were electrical
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; one was a double relay that gave up. 2nd happened on the way to Jerome 2
&gt; weeks
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; a double relay is still needed in a carb engine (fuel pump shut off if
&gt; &gt; engine stops)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; ago = lost injector power because of the harness failure. I did not cut the
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; wiring harness failure will shut down any engine, just happened to be the
&gt; &gt; wire to the injectors
&gt;
