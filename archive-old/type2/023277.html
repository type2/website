Subject: intake manifold question
Mime-Version: 1.0

i'll be putting my engine back in tomorrow.  when i removed the intake 
manifold and carb., there were 2 metal gaskets on each intake.  these were 
mucked with a black rubber like gasket material between them, on the intake 
and on the engine.

do i need this muck?  what kind of liquid to rubber gasket is it...so i can 
buy some.

on a side note, my butt hurts from the reaming at the machine shop.  $242 
for 4 new studs, pulling out 2 stripped studs, and a helicoil in 
#4.  ouch.  oh well, at least he didn't open up the engine to do it.  funny 
though, he said the spark plugs were the wrong type, so he put new ones in 
for me (without asking i might add.)  apparently, they weren't long 
enough.  i'm interested to see how it runs now.  i better hear some 
purrrrrrring!
