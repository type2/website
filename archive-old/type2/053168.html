Subject: Mercedes 15&quot; wheels mounted: info on how.

Hi,
	Well, I've finally got my 15&quot; alloys mounted. Here's the info
for any that are interested. Maybe this post could go into the library?
 I'll skip the &quot;Why do it?&quot; bit for now (I wanted better lateral stability).
 There could also be a post on which wheels work, featuring Karl's list of
what alloys were fitted to which Mercs, too.

 Mounting Mercedes wheels.

 I believe some Merc wheels just bolt straight up. The ones I bought
didn't and this post describes what I did to get mine to fit. I think
the 14&quot; ones from earlier cars are the likely candidates for an easy
fit, but I wanted 15&quot; rims. I am pretty sure that Mercedes made rims in
different offsets and mounting-face-thicknesses, too, so it's an excellent
idea to check _all_ the measurements on your rims before you commit to
buying them.

 Parameters:
	1) diameter
	2) width
	3) pitch circle diameter (PCD)
	4) offset
	5) mounting issues:	stud size
					nut seat profile
					mounting face thickness.

 There are some derived parameters (eg backspacing) which tie in to the
above.

 I bought 15&quot;x7&quot; &quot;15-hole&quot; rims. They were OK on the first three and the
offset
was close: correctable with small shims. The mounting parameters were more
tricky: the boltholes were too small (12mm) and the mounting face was way
too thick for the stock studs, a problem that was exacerbated by the need
to use spacers to correct the offset.

 I got the mounting holes drilled out to clear 14mm studs. You could
alternatively get 12mm studs and nuts for the VW hubs and leave the
wheels intact- this way they could be returned to Merc service if wanted.
 I wanted to be able to use the stock VW wheels as spares/snows and
preferred the strength of 14mm studs and so I hacked up the wheels.
 The stock front studs are 45mm long, and the rears are 35mm long.
They have a 14mmx1.5mm thread, BTW, and the length is measured from
shoulder to tip.
To mount my wheels I needed an extra 20mm for the wheel itself and
another 5mm to correct the offset with a spacer (shim) resulting in
60mm studs at the rear and 70mm at the front. I was unable to find 70mm
studs and so I have not fitted spacers at the front. This leaves 15mm
of thread for the nut (~10 turns), which seems adequate. I have 6mm of
spacer at the rear, so the net result is that my front wheels are
5mm inboard of where they should be and the rears are 1mm outboard,
&gt;from what I have read I don't think this should cause any serious problems.
 Replacing the studs was a matter of dismantling the hubs and driving
out the old studs with a hammer (hub supported with a 23mm socket around
the stud head to prevent any warping) and then driving in the new ones
similarly.
 The 60mm studs I used at the rear didn't have quite enough thread to allow
the stock wheels to bolt straight up (damn!), so I now have to use a small
spacer to fit them properly, resulting in another small offset error.
 The fronts are OK because the front hubs are thicker.
 
 I may grind down the mounting seat on the front rims to allow the nuts to
sit lower. This would allow better thread engagement or spacers to correct
the offset, though probably not both :-(

 I opted for 195/70R15C tyres: These are standard fit on lots of European
vans
including the T4 transporter (&quot;Eurovan&quot;) and hence reasonably priced.
 Alternative sizes might be 205/65R15 or even 225/60R15, though I'm not
sure the 225s would fit. 215mm tyres don't come in the correct nominal
rolling
radii, though if you can find some nice chunky 215/60s with a good stiff
sidewall, they'll probably sit high enough to be OK. I'm pretty sure I
could fit 205s in with my current setup, and may do so later on if I
want more dry weather grip.
 The tyres I chose were Michelin Agilis 81s. These are load range D/8-ply,
M+S rated. Load index is 104/102R (1874lbs at 106mph) and have a 10mm tread
(normal is 9mm: so you get a few more miles per tyre). Michelin also
sells lower spec Agilis van tyres (41 and 61) with &quot;reinforced&quot; (97S) or
load range C/6-ply (100R) ratings. The 61 and 81 are also available in
185R14C, incidentally.

 The net result? The van feels more stable and more responsive. Cornering
is flatter, lane-changing crisper, sidewinds less influential. The ride
is a little stiffer, as you'd expect. Interestingly, the steering is
lighter than before (!) which wasn't what I expected. The big wheels 
and fat tyres look pretty neat, too.

 The stiffer sidewalls don't bulge as much so I suspect the rolling radius
has increased slightly (higher gearing and lower speed indication).

 Feel free to contact me with any questions, though I doubt I'll be able
to help with the obvious one: &quot;Which merc wheel is a simple bolt up?&quot;...

Cheers,
	 W.
