Subject: Re: [T2] identify the canvas(that is 4 sale)


&gt; 40.5&quot; from one end to the first seam of the square cut out.
&gt; 24.5&quot; from the other end to the seam and 1&quot; between the square cutout.
&gt; total length of 66&quot;

Hmmm, must have shrunk an inch!
It is 68 to 72. Should have been 67'' total, 41'' on one end and 25'' on the
other.

BTW, the measurement for a 73 is 63'' total, 43'' on one end and 20'' on the
other. [they have a slot for the bar support]
