&gt;I talked to Gary this morning and he has no idea on how to fix this.
&gt;He says he knows of nobody being able to restore these carbs.
&gt;Only option seems to be to replace it with some type of aftermarket carb kit.

Baloney.  Just take the carb to a good machine shop and have them rebush the throttle shaft bore.  Should cost under $50.

&gt;The only other thing I thought of is while I was talking to AVP about putting
&gt;in a 2.0, they mentioned the idle might run a little rough because of the
&gt;stock jets but it would have no damaging effect on the motor.

Idle won't be rough - the jets will work fine.  In a perfect world, put the bus on a chassis dyno with wideband O2 sensor and make sure the mixture is 14.6 at idle and 12.x under acceleration from 1500rpm-redline.
