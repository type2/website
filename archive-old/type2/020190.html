&gt; HI gang!
&gt;
&gt; I posted this a while back but never got any e-mail responses.
&gt; I am converting my once Corvair powered truck back to VW and need some help.
&gt; [...].  I am not sure what is right and what is
&gt; wrong with my truck. I do have some problems worked out but without access to
&gt; another bus to look at I am not 100% sure.

Even better than digipics would be a trip to the junkyard.  You should be able to
find at least a handfull of bay window busses just sitting there in various
stages of undress.  You could sit on the ground, take notes, pictures all you
want and if you think you might have missed something, get your hand stamped so
you can go home check your bus and get back in without dropping another buck or
two.  I was in two junkyards last week and between the two of them there were
about 14 bays
