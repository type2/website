Hey all--

I had an ac unit in my bus (78 Westy) that hooked up under the dash and had a
second belt running off the fan that went to the compressor which was located
in the left rear corner of the engine compartment.  I bought my bus in march,
and when i was taking it for a test drive i asked the po (he insisted he go)
if the ac worked.  He said Sure! turned it on and said &quot;Feel this?&quot;  I tried
to hide my utter contempt at his poor appraisal of my IQ and informed him it
was 50 degrees outside, that of course it was going to blow cold.  So I asked
him if it really worked, and he insisted it did, but alas, I never had the
luck with it he did.... it  blows cold in the winter and warm in the summer.
 I looked into getting it repaired, but it looked pretty expensive, and it
was only a typical chicago summer last year, at the most, 500 people dying at
the worst of the heatwaves.  Besides, the times I did try to turn it on (even
though it would only blow hot air) it seemed like I had the option of using
the ac or driving the bus, but not both at the same time.  I even tried to
give it away (that was before I knew you vultures existed) and everywhere I
called just laughed at me.  I couldn't even give it away once I took it out,
so I pitched it.  I still have the compressor, though if anyone wants it.
 I'm not sure anymore what the point of my story is, I'm just glad it's
cooler this summer.  Now my ac would probably work...
