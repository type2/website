Subject: thinking about selling our Westy

Hey list,
Our 68 Westy has been sitting far too much since we bought a pop-up trailer
(only put 300 miles on it between state inspections over the last year).
Since we have three other vehicles (66 Bug and 94&amp;97 F*rds) we're seriously
considering selling it. Just wondering what the the list thinks of the price
($3K) considering all the work we've done to it. I've put up a web page with
all the details, would appreciate if you'd take a look and send a P-mail, is
the price fair, too much, not enough, etc. Thanks a bunch!

Jon
