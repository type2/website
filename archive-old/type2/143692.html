Subject: Subject: Re: [T2] Changing Muffler on 2cc 76 

&gt;Now I have yet another use for that dental
mirror I
just acquired...But I haven't checked to see if
the CC is installed.

Well, the catalytic convertor for a 2cc engine is
probably very small.  Perhaps you WILL need the
dental mirror.  On normal sized VW aircooled
engines, say 1600-2000cc, you can see the
catalytic convertor fairly easily.  Just look
under the apron. 

Just wondering, what kind of MPG does this 2cc
engine get?  Top speed?

J/K.  Early Friday post.  



Happy bussin'
