Last night someone, on another elist I'm on, mentioned that there is a
battery available (used by the hot rod crowd) that has 3 poles -- common
ground, 6v hot, &amp; 12v hot.  I have no idea who makes them or where to get
them but they are reported to cost a bit over $100.  So if you have a six
volt system and don't want to convert everything over to 12 volt, you can
have the best of both worlds.

&gt;  You shouldn't have any problems installing the 6v flywheel and clutch as
&gt; long as its 180mm and not 200mm. When I bought my bus 8 years ago i did
&gt; convert to 12v but left the 6v starter.The extra torque really helps when
&gt; the weather is cold.
