Subject: Re: should I drive my Bus to TX?

well,

My $0.02... i have taken my bus all over the us, to texas and back 2 or 3
times... from missouri, and it went well... i keep up on maintenance and
have a dirt simple 1600 dual port.

If your bus is in questionable condition, it might be ill advised.  If you
dont have an emergency fund, it might be ill advised.

I take my bus everywhere, but if it breaks i have all my tools with me,
many spare parts, towing service, and emergency funds to have any needed
part (up to and including a transmission) sent to me from a reputable
vendor.  OR if i have the spare part here, i'd catch a greyhound home and
go back with the parts needed later on...

Really, either prepare your bus to as new condition, and be prepared for
mishaps, or prepare your bus as good as you can get it and be prepared for
mishaps...

I dunno, plenty of people head out with no thought to breakdowns, i put
too much thought into em... which is the better way to go i dont know.

in the end its your decision. just get as informed as you can and prepare
according to what your research and heart tell you to.

peas,

Steve
