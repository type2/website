Subject: Brake Lights Ain't Broke No More!

Just to finish the story, I put two new brake light pressure switches on
this evening and the lights are back in action.

This brings up another question. I notice that the tail lights are a bit dim
for my taste. Is this just 'old bulb' syndrome, or is there a brighter bulb
that I can use in the stock socket?

Thanks,
Dave
