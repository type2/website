Subject: Re: [T2] Turn signals failure

[...]



&gt; Now or course I checked the archives and know that this was on there
&gt; just a few weeks ago, but alas the cgi-script don't look like they are
&gt; completely up.
&gt;
&gt; My turn signal/horn/high beams don't work at least not now, they used
&gt; to. Using the hazzard works just fine so there is power getting at least
&gt; to the bulbs. Is it a relay failure that causes this or was it some
&gt; other switch in the column. These are what I remember being some
&gt; possible solutions. If someone thinks it is a relay, a p/n would be
&gt; great. TIA and a pat on the back for our system admins.

Looking at the wiring diagram..... the only common point between all 3 is the
connecter in the steering column.

I was thinking maybe a bad ignition switch because it feeds fuses 11 and 12, but
fuse 12 feeds the hazard switch and the hazards work. The dimmer switch just
goes to ground.

Check the harness's that runs up the column. Try pushing them up the shaft. You
should find 2 harness's and 2 washer hoses. One harness is for the wipers and
the other for TS, horn, head lamps.
