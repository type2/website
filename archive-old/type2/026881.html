Subject: RE: Cheap timing light/tach-dwell meter and other tools? 

((Originally posted on May 29, 2001))

This is not an ad.  I just thought you would want to know.

OK, how about these buys!!!


Vacuum/Pressure Tester - CP7802  Sale Price: $9.99
    Hose and &quot;T&quot; adapter included   ((I don't know if I will use this, but 
it was cheap.))


Compression Tester - CP7826      Sale Price: $11.99
   14&quot; flexible oil and grease resistant hose
   14mm and 18mm ends fit most spark plug openings
  (I recommend DO NOT buy the compression checker.  Does NOT have the quick 
connect, and hose is too weak.  Good for an emergency, but better to wait 
for a Sears sale, even if waiting for a year!!)


Sunpro Engine Analyzer - CP7675  Garage Sale Price: $5.00
   ANALOG (needle + gauge) Features: Amps, Volts,
   Point Resistance, Dwell, High RPM ,Low RPM  ((You do not 'need' this if 
you have the Digital one.  But for 5 bucks, I keep it on the wall in the 
garage, in a clear plastic bag, so I know EXACTLY where it is when I don't 
remember where I put the Digital one.  I should have bought another to keep 
in the VW.  For 5 bucks, you cannot have TOO MANY!!  And with a fixed 
shipping and handling charge, you will want to buy a few/lot of these for 
your friends and as door prizes/gifts for the camp outs you are 
sponsoring/attending.))


Digital Engine Multimeter - CP7676GS  Garage Sale Price: $14.95
   Easy to read digital liquid crystal (LCD) display.
   A compact digital multimeter with many test functions including Tach,
Dwell, Volts, Ohms and Diode Check.  ((Fantastic!!  Goes for $99 at Trak 
Auto.))

((I also bought the yellow plastic timing light for about $40; inductive.))
