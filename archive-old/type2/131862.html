Subject: 76 bus idle problems.update.

I searched and searched today for answers.and found that when both sides of
the vac can are hooked up, should be timed at 5deg atdc.  So i did
that....................and it does idle better, but i had to turn the idle
adjust screw quite a ways out...............................

On my other fi vans, they usually idle higher and then slow down after a few
minutes............any suggestions here?
