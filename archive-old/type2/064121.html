Subject: (F)) I swear it's a true story (longish)

I swear the following is a true story from BTL**:

A Soft Deep Voice drifts from the air
&quot;Jeff . . . . Jeff&quot;
A sleep deprived, tired voice mumbles from the
drivers seat of a '80 VW bus, really early in the morning.
Jeff - &quot;Huh, wha, who's there?&quot;
SDV -  &quot;It's me, Jeff, your bus&quot;
Jeff - &quot;What, come on, who is it really?&quot;
SDV -  &quot;It's your bus&quot;
Jeff - &quot;OK, so now my bus is talking to me.&quot;
SDV -  &quot;Why haven't you changed my oil lately?&quot;
Jeff - &quot;It's just an '80 Vanagon, who cares? It's
       not like it's a nice old split window.&quot;
SDV -  &quot;I am not an 'it', I'm a Vanagon Westfalia&quot;
Jeff - &quot;Yea, so?&quot;
SDV -  &quot;I carry a fine tradition of Volkswagen heritage.
       You treated '76 with extra care and attention,
       you loved '64 Deluxe.  You hated '67 Deluxe, but 
       that one was a renegade anyway, refused to function
       properly.  You still have that '67 Squareback in
       in the back lot you haven't driven for 5 years!&quot;
Jeff - &quot;Yeah, ok&quot;
SDV -  &quot;You drive me 100 miles every day, don't you have
       any pride in your vehicle?&quot;
Jeff - &quot;A little&quot;
SDV -  &quot;Well, it's time to show your pride, time to do
       some PREVENTATIVE maintenance, it's time to clean
       up the trash, time to see if anyone else has some
       pride in their Vanagon, get on the 'net&quot;

The next day:

Jeff - &quot;Hey bus&quot;
SDV -  &quot;Yes, did you find anything?&quot;
Jeff - &quot;There's this e-mail group, list or something that
       discusses VW busses!  These folks are crazy.  I 
       don't know enough about busses to join that crowd?&quot;
SDV -  &quot;Give it a try&quot;

A few days later:

Jeff - &quot;Wow, after listening in for awhile, I know more
       about VW's than I thought.  I can participate, I
       can ask stupid questions and get staight answers&quot;
SDV -  &quot;Let's get working on those little things that will
       show some pride in your ride, even if I am JUST a
       Vanagon&quot;
Jeff - &quot;Don't talk that way, let's roll down my sleeves
       and start getting dirty, greasy and then clean
       again.  Time for an oil change. Maybe I'll even 
       name you!&quot;
SDV -  &quot;Don't push it, you never named your vehicles
       before, so I can't expect miracles . . . yet&quot;
