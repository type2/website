Subject: Re: [T2] Megasquirt Reviews??

Jim,

Ed(tbone....) has one on his bus and seems pretty happy with it.

I got in on the last group buy and am waiting for my kits(September).
Several folks on the MS list have put them in their Porsche's.  And
as near as I can tell, several people from this list and the vintagvw list 
are going to try them.

You can probably get an ECU for yours for a lot less than $750, but
for ~$120, you can build your own and make it do waht you want...besides
losing the AFM, double relay and resistor pack and ECU off of your current 
FI.

I want one cause I want one of those bus cams that say 
&quot;not recomended for fi&quot;.

YMMV...of course.

Cheers ,dave

&gt; Hello Listers:
&gt; 
&gt; A few weeks ago the Megasquirt fuel injection computer was mentioned here on
&gt; the list.  Is anyone using this setup?  I'd like to hear what real people
&gt; using this gizmo on air-cooled VW's have to say about it.  I've been
&gt; thinking about switching to FI on my 71 Bus, but I don't want to spend $750+
&gt; for an FI engine control box.  It seems the next group buy for the
&gt; Megasquirt will be in September, so I have some time to spend thinking about
&gt; it.  Or if I get really ambitious, I could make my own PCBoard, which is
&gt; what I do for a living anyway.
