Subject: erratic high beams

    About a year ago my '71 started wigging out whenever I put the left
turn signal on. Weird shorts and ghosting and rapid flashing through
both turn signals and the high beams. Did that for two days (I didn't
get a chance to look at it) and then starting spitting sparks and smoke
out of the switch. Signal went on and stayed on. I suddenly found the
time to look at it (on the side of the road, actually). Turned out that
27 years of dust and goo had grown across the contacts until they were
shorting (and setting fire to the goo).
    Take that switch off and clean it up. Check the wiring harness
through the column. When you're putting it back on, experiment with
shimming the &quot;yoke&quot; that holds the switch on and you can probably
restore your blinker-turning-off whatsit, too. I did.
