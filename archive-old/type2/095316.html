Subject: Steering damper bolts

Hi All.

I bought a new steering damper for my Bus from Bus Depot. As there
is not one on there at the moment, I don't have the hardware to put it on.
On the Bus Boys website the hardware is listed as:

N 10440.1 Bolt - Steering Damper to Beam $0.55
N 10470.7 Bolt - Steering Damper to Swing Lever $3.50
N 11310.1 Nylock Nut for Swing Lever Bolt above $0.35
Does any one know what sizes this equates too?  I need to put this on
this weekend in preparation for Transporters by the Tunnel in North Adams
MA next weekend, and want to buy the hardware. Also, which end of the
 shock attaches to the beam?
I looked in my Bentley but don't remember seeing a good picture.

Thanks in Advance

Jeff.
