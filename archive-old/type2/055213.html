have no clue, mine is an automatic

&gt; Q: If I take my head off to inspect, do I have to use new gaskets (can't
&gt; find them for sale separately)or can I use a little silicone?

heads don't use gaskets on a 78, clean and tight, don't use any silicone
either

&gt; Q:I have a lot of oil in my fan and heating system. Could this be from my

most likely the seal.
