Subject: Re: [T2] CarTalk

eric writ:
&gt;This weekend on Car Talk, a caller was asking for input on a van she could
&gt;live in during an extended road trip. She was interested in the Bus and the
&gt;Car Talk guys actually agreed with her! I guess they forgot that the VW Bus
&gt;was #10 on the 10 Worst Cars of the Millenium

agreed! i almost fell off my seesaw. car talk is just on sometime for the
sake of being on. i wake up to find someone had put it on and left the
room. i said wait a minute to myself -- 10 worst cars, right? was she a
plant, a lurker? style: it was mostly about the style. the rust up to the
windows, the description and the whole curb appeal thing (i think the bros
were fantasixing on a split).  there was some hot and heavy smooching by
the car talk bros onto the butt of a bus... i really thought they were
kidding, wern't they?  if not, someone ought get that girl on the
list,,airs.  - steve
