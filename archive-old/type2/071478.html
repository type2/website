Hi all!

I will traveling to Dallas from Annapolis, MD, weekend (26,27th) for a quick 
trip to get a new engine/tranny for my westy. Just wondering if there will be 
any shows that weekend along the way. I will be traveling through Knoxville, 
Nashville, and on to Dallas where I will stay with a friend, pick up the 
engine and tranny and shoot back for Maryland. I'm leaving Friday, AM, and 
hope to be home Monday.
