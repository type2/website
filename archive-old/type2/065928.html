Subject: Re: busses, environmental degradation, Veeduber, Eric

This is something that has always bothered me too.

As Bob Hoover says in his &quot;The Forever Car&quot; sermon,
&quot;Want cleaner air? Get rid of the cars.&quot;   Amen to that.

I have a 1966 bus, it has a new engine in near perfect tune but I expect
it pollutes more per gallon of gas than my 1987 Jetta with 161,000 miles
on it. (I should run through the pollution check station to find out.)
On the highway I get mebbe 22 MPG with my bus, 38-40 MPG with the Jetta.
The Jetta has fuel injection, electronic ignition, an oxygen sensor,
catalytic converter, etc. etc.  My bus has none of those things.

The point about volume of exhaust vs. %CO and/or ppm hydrocarbons is a
good point.  Certainly the 4WD V8 engined trucks pollute more than a
Geo Metro just by the shear volume of exhaust produced.  This doesn't
make me feel better about my bus's pollution however, it just makes
me think 4WD V8 engined trucks are very bad commuter vehicles.  These
big trucks have their place, hauling big heavy stuff.  Commuting to work
in them (unless they are needed for the job) is a crime.

The point can't be avoided, driving a 1966 bus is more *bad*, exhaust
pollution wise, than driving a 1997 Golf or even Eurovan would be.
(I'm unsure about the argument that producing a new car makes more
pollution than the exhaust pollution differential between driving an
old car and driving a new car.  Anyone have any hard numbers on this point?
I'd love to know the answer.)

I love the old bus tho.  I love the honest, work-on-it-yourself ethic
of vehicle ownership.  I like how most everything on or in the bus is
made of steel or aluminum or rubber with very little plastic.  Volkswagen's
proud history of quality and economy, good workmanship and service (at least
as it was in the 1960's) stands as an example to me what an automaker
can be and should be.

So, I'll do what I can.  I'll keep the bus in the best mechanical shape
possible and always in good tune.  I won't take unecessary trips in any of
my cars.  I will continue to rely on my bicycle to get to work and around
town whenever possible.  I'll recycle, conserve resources, and work for
a clean environment.  In this way, I continue to feel good about owning
and driving my Vintage Volkswagen.
