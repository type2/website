Hi all,

I have two problems that I am trying to correct on my 1981 Westy (automatic):

1.  When I turn the ignition key to the on position the fuel pump starts
running.
	(is there another cause beside the Air flow sensor?)

2.  	The starting motor seems to have given up the ghost.  For many weeks
while trying to straighten out other problems (which, thanks to list
members I have corrected :-) the starting motor worked like a champ.
While trying to start the engine yesterday, the starting motor made some
strange noises and now won't turn the engine.  I climbed underneath and
inspected the electrical connections and grounds (all seem to be fine) I
noticed that the starting motor was hot.  :-(	My question is: Will the
starting motor from a 1980 westy (manual transmission) fit my 1981.  If
not can parts from the '80 be used to repair the '81?

Any suggestion would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Keith
