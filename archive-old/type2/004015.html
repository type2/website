This is something that should only happen if you have been driving at
186,001 mph at an orbital altitude of 50+ miles.

&gt;After installing my GORGEOUS new stereo.....I am having trouble...
&gt;....in the past two days I have found that my DIGITAL/QUARTZ clock seems to
&gt;be losing about 5 minutes every hour.
&gt;Now I did my science homework in my day, and as far as I know this isn't
&gt;scientifically possible, unless of course type 2's exist in a parallel
&gt;universe etc. etc. etc. or someone has used something other that quartz to
&gt;run this display
&gt;Any ideas
&gt;GArp
