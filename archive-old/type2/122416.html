Subject: Alternator or regulator or something else

Hey Folks,

Having read all that is present in the archive and library, I am about to
embark on a diagnostic/remediation exercise on my '72.

Symptoms include:

battery runs down
brake warning light is dimly illuminated when the headlights are on (there
is a connection to the voltage regulator, according to the wiring diagram).

maybe related:

occasionally, near total loss of power (originally, I thought this was
ignition related and have replaced every ignition components and have
installed a pertronix system.  I now think it is electrically or fuel
related - maybe a intermittent fuel blockage).

My plan is to make sure all connections are clean and tight, perform voltage
checks, per Bentley, then to replace both the regulator and alternator.

If anyone has advice, it will be appreciated.

Really, I would greatly love to eliminate the intermittent power loss
problem.  If I do not find some electrical issue, I plan to yank the tank.

Thanks,

REH
