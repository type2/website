Subject: [T2] Quiet Please...

It might be time for us to start to wind down our public renderance of
sorrow and shock for what has recently happened.  We all recognize the
tragedy of the incident, and I believe we all know that we did what we could
to help in the only way we could help.

AIRS members stepped up and rose to the occasion as A.I.R.S. members
dedicated themselves to.  We did the right thing in helping Kristen Laurite
continue her journey across the country.  Apparently it was her want and
dream to continue.  She faced the risk and did it more real than any would
have thought she would have.  She was a brave young woman no doubts.

&gt;From this point forward let's be quiet and reflective, and just think of
Kristen and her family.  Let's pray for the family, and simply let them
grieve.  I wish I had an answer to all of this but I don't.

A.I.R.S., it's purpose, it's mission, and it's method are all under review.
I see no large changes on the horizon, but I do believe we will see new
developments emerge as time passes.

Some might leave the A.I.R.S. list because of it not being structured the
way they want, but others will join and take up the charge and the cause.
A.I.R.S. has not failed yet, it has not hurt any but in fact has helped
several. 

Kristen will be remembered for a long time even though only a couple of us
actually ever met her in person.  Let's also think about how we might be
active toward helping the authorities find her killer.  This person must not
be allowed to do this again.  Our community can help and we know how.

As we learn more about what we might do for the family, we will pass it on
to all of you that have interest in offering some words, or cards, or
flowers, or other assistance.

I don't think this list has ever encountered something so serious as this,
but now we realize even moreso that tragedy can land on our doorstep.  Let's
deal with it and build ourselves toward better community.

Join the group that fits you best.  NEATO/LIMBO or A.I.R.S. or whatever.
Just dedicate yourselves to being of help where you can and when you can.
we can only rely on each other.

I am so sorry that all this has happened.  It's been a tough few days.  I
have a lot of thinking to do.  This thing has hit me quite hard, but I am
hopeless sentamentalist anyway.

If you need to offer something then P Mail me.  I will listen.

I really do think a lot of all of you.  This list is an amazing group.  I am
proud to be associated with all of you.

Thanks for tolerating the ramblings,
