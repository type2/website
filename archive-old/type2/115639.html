&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I'm getting on well with rebuilding my 2 litre engine (slow, but I want to
&gt;&gt; do it right).  I've just got to the stage of installing the crank and cam
&gt; in
&gt;&gt; the left case half and I'm following Wilson's book.
&gt; 
&gt; Ignore Wilson's error and connect the dots.

Daves,

Dave H. is talking about indexing the distributor drive pinion, not the cam
gear and crank. Wilson's book is not very clear on how to do this.

Here is how it is done in the &quot;bug me&quot; type IV rebuild video, and bear with
me, it is difficult to describe something like this but I'll try:

Have the left side of the motor on the stand with the dots on the cam and
crank gears aligned. Move #1 rod so it straight up all the way - TDC. This
will be a slight clockwise rotation. Take the distributor pinion and put the
shim on it with some grease to keep it from falling off. Take the
distributor, with the rotor installed as well as the distributor clamp, but
not the o-ring. Lube the pinion with some oil. Offer up the distributor to
the distributor pinion with the rotor pointing to the notch, and install the
distributor pinion into the bore, using the distributor to hold it, all the
while keeping the rotor pointed to the notch. If the crank is kept in its
original position and the rotor is kept on the notch, the pinion will be in
the correct index. There may be some very slight crank rotation required to
get the pinion into the bore and the distributor seated all the way in. Put
the nut on the distributor clamp. You will remove the distributor later to
install the o-ring and the spring on top of the pinion.
