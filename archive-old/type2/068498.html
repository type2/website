Subject: Re: Content (or lack thereof)...PLEASE READ!

&gt;It was also pointed out that the number of people who receive the list and
&gt;the number of people who post fluff to the list are not the same thing at
&gt;all; these are independent of each other.
        &lt;SNIP&gt;
&gt;people, because those sometimes are beginning to mean 40 messages per day
&gt;and it's just too much. Yes, if we limited the number of subscribers we
&gt;would deny ourselves the company of people with &quot;a wealth of knowledge and
&gt;information&quot;. But how many are we driving off now because they have better,
&gt;more mechanical things to do than read mountains of irrelevant blather?

        Perhaps I can offer a solution. Many email programs now offer
filtering, many more are following thier lead. Many of the serious fluff
posters can be identified. You probably see where I'm going by now. I
currently skim the list and stop to read topics that intrest me, from
people who have earned my respect. If I feel someone posts too much fluff,
I can filter that individual myself, and if John Q. Public feels that Mr.
X's posts are of great earthly significance he can read them. Everybody's
happy, assuming everyone *does* make an effort to keep down on the fluff.
Reply to listmembers personally, *not publicly*, if you want to make a
funny... And there you have it, an interactive solution which makes Ken's
life a bit easier. And how about some kind of democratic vote before folks
get booted? This is only a suggestion, because if Ken wants to be a
benevolent dictator it's his right-he's the one paying the bills. And I
could certainly understand his wanting to be for simplicity's sake.

        A reminder-If all you want to say after reading this is &quot;hear hear&quot;
or &quot;get lost creep&quot; please say it to me and/or Ken personally-less fluff
that way...   ;-)

Peace,
