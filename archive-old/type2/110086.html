Subject: Re: type2 Digest 10 Jul 2003 16:00:00 -0000 Issue 2555

&gt; I've  been trying to get the color code for this bus, but can't seem 
&gt; to find it.  It ought to be an easy one since at least 80% of the 
&gt; '68-'71 Westies are this same off white color.  The ID plate says 
&gt; 5239, but I know this isn't the same as what was on the (missing) 
&gt; silver sticker.  Can anyone whelp me out with either the name of this 
&gt; color, or the code?


5239 is all whites. 
The code following that on the plate tells the story: 

 523904 = Police white (polizeiweis)             ???
 523907 = Pearl white (Perlweis) Westy only      L87
 523917 = Lotus white (lotosweis) Westy only     L282
 523926 = Pastel white (pastellweis) Westy only  L90D
