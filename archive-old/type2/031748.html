&gt; situation: voltmeter, oil pressure, and oil temp gauges to be wired
&gt; question:  i need a ground for both the light and the power of the gauge, 
&gt; equaling 6 ground wires.  i also need a power ground for each (3 more wires.)

I wired the grounds together and ran em to the clip on the front panel
where a whole bunch of other grounds, well grounded
&gt; 
&gt; 1) where can i get the power lead from to power the gauge?  this needs to 
&gt; be fused.._dot_can i use an in-line fuse?  if so, what kind of fuse?

they can be inline fused', I did but don't remember the size

&gt; 2) in the dash, all of my dashlights (powered with the headlights) are in a 
&gt; series (jumping from one to the next.)  can i continue this series and jump 
&gt; from the last spot on the dash to my 3 gauges?

I did this also but wired em in parallel so if one burned out all the
others wouldn't go out, also allows me to dim em too
