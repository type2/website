&gt;&gt; I'm looking to purchase a winch for my bus.  I guess it would have to 
&gt;&gt; be
&gt;&gt; electric or hand-powered, given that the engine is on the opposite end
&gt;&gt; (although I suppose I *could* mount it on the back) but I was wondering
&gt;&gt; about just that:  Where to mount it?
&gt;
&gt; The back isn't such a bad idea.  If you're stuck, do you really want to
&gt; continue in the direction that got you stuck?

depends.  you could just be leaving the woods after camping where
rain had made the &quot;road&quot; you came in on a little muddier than you'd like.

&gt;&gt; I could probably drill holes in the front bumper for a mount, but the
&gt;&gt; last thing
&gt;&gt; I want to do is mount it somewhere that's gonna cause damage when
&gt;&gt; i put load on it...
&gt;
&gt; You have to have a mount that is capable of taking a load that is 
&gt; greater
&gt; than the weight of the bus.  If the bus is well-stuck, that is the pull 
&gt; it
&gt; takes to get it out.
&gt;
&gt; The only way to do it properly is to make a custom bumper that attaches 
&gt; to
&gt; the frame.  In a bus, that means to the front axle mounts or to the
&gt; torsion housing region.

point well taken.

&gt; Have you considered something simpler, like a come-along?

but that would be too easy, right?

Seriously though, I've been in a couple of time sensitive situations
that I've managed to get out of but which would've been a bit less
harrowing if I had a winch -- digging out of a beach while the tide is
coming in (on Frasier Island), getting pulled out of snow banks on
exit ramps during blizzards while running closer to empty than I'd like, 
etc.

Some of these situations could have been avoided, some of them
were low risk but unexpected events occurred, etc.   A winch doesn't
necessarily solve any of these problems, nor does it do anything a
come-along doesn't, but it gets things done a little quicker and
gives a little extra insurance.
