	From the Haynes 914 book, page 10:

Compression Ratios:
1.7 Liter  W,EA, 8.2:1;  EB 7.3:1
1.8 Liter  EC, 7.3:1; AN 8.6:1
2.0 Liter  GA 7.6:1, GB 8.0:1

No year-by-year cross-reference is given.

So if you've got 1.8 914 pistons, they're either 7.3:1 CR or EIGHT POINT SIX
TO ONE!!! Yippie Yi Yo Kayaye!

	If you've got the piston in front of you, you could use the
following McGyver procedures to *estimate* the volume:
	Buy or borrow a can of Play Dough or better yet, 
oil-based modeling clay. Clean the top of the piston, then
spray some WD-40 or rub a little light oil on the top as a release
agent. Make a lump of clay big enough to hold its shape after being 
molded over the top of the piston, and mold it over the top of the piston. 
Then take it off CAREFULLY, preserving the impression of the dome.
	Place the mold, open end up, on a diet scale or postage scale that 
reads in grams. Or use ounces and covert at 28grams/ounce.
	Pour water into the mold until its full. The wieght of the water gives
a good estimate of volume, since one gram of water = 1cc at 25c. 
	Clean the top of the piston again.

	ALTERNATELY measure the height of the dome and the diameter, in 
mm, and find or work-out the formula for the volume of a dome. If
the dome is a hemisphere its easier, but there is a formula even if 
its not, I just can't work it out in my head quick like here.
