Subject: Any advice on cleaning Westy curtains?

I was lucky enough to be given a nice set of bright YELLOW curtains to go
with my bright ORANGE bus.  While not authentic, I like the combo and it
will go well with the new seat fabric (green/orange/yellow).  It may not
be the fastest car on the block, but it's going to be the brightest!

Befor I put the new curtains in, I would like to wash them.  These
curtains are bright yellow and a kind of &quot;burlap&quot; texture.  I would like
to know if anyone has had experience with these or has washing
recommendations?

How bad is the shrinkage problem?

Are they colorfast?

Should I risk this at all?

                           TIA,
                           H Steven Dolan
