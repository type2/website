Subject: Re: [T2] Wind Sheer

I have the C load Vredenstein snow tires all the way around, and I've had
nary an issue with the wind. The Goethels bridge and the Verrazzano gave me
some scares, but the best advice I have regarding the wind is to slow down.

P.S. Thanks to Seann Stafford, whose 'Friedrich' has inspired the new name
for my Westy -- 'Karla'!


&gt; Folks,
&gt;
&gt; Same with me, last week we had 35mph+ gusts at exact right angles to the
&gt; direction I was traveling and it was bad...not as bad as my 67 in the
&gt; olden days, but worse than I expected.
&gt;
&gt; My 78 had new kyb shocks, steering dampner and new correct yoko's all
&gt; around.  It was bad enough at some times that if my attention wandered for
&gt; just a couple of sconds, I was starting to cross my lane marker.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone every drive in bad crosswinds and then pick up someone else in the
&gt; front seat and drive back in the same sort of winds?....better or worse?
