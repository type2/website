Subject: Re: [T2] Dual solexes or ?

I've got a single Webber progressive in my '74. It sucks when the weather
gets below 70degrees because of the fuel/air mix freezing in the VERY LONG manifold.
But it is quite easyto adjust is 50% less likely to fail than a dual carb setup. And you never
have to worry aboutbalancing the carbs.

In the 70s the Webber Prog was pushed heavily as a way to increase
fuel economy. The best performance, fuel and power, would come from a FI
system - but that canbe a headache.

I'm in Florida right now and would love to trade! My Webber Prog loves this
hot weather and the dual webbers would be right at home in Tennessee!

&gt; From a
philosophical standpoint, I would like to know why most people
&gt; get
&gt; rid of their dual
PDSIT carbs on the 72-74 bus in exchange for other
&gt; setups...i.e. dual webers, single
progressive, etc.
&gt;
&gt; I currently am running dual weber 34 ICT's on my 74 SC, and
although
&gt; they  seem to perform adequately, they are extremely difficult to
&gt; adjust
because  (1) I do not have an engine compartment top hatch in
&gt; the SC, (2) the  hexagonal
linkage, although seemingly infinitely
&gt; adjustable, is unforgiving  when you're
trying to disconnect it, and
&gt; (3) the webers are placed  extremely low in the engine
bay...(very
&gt; short intake manifolds) which makes  it tough to get to some of the
&gt;
adjustment screws.
&gt;
&gt; I recall that my dual PDSITs on my 73 and 74 bus (in a previous
life)
&gt; were  easier to adjust because of the location of the adjustment
&gt; screws.  I also
recall that on the 73, I switched to a single weber
&gt; progressive that  I  HATED because it
kept loading up.  However, I
&gt; can't remember why I  switched from the dual PDSIT's!  That was
25
&gt; years ago...
&gt;
&gt; I think I would like to go back to dual PDSIT's...does anyone have
any
&gt; thoughts on this?  Thanks, Greg
