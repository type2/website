Subject: Replace OIl Cooler Seals?

Oh glorious list, riddle me this:
Attempting to remove the oil cooler on my '77 with the engine still in. 
I have removed all the tinwork, the fan, and the four bolts that hold 
the fan housing to the engine, as well as the little flaps that are on 
the top of the heat exchangers. Do I need to remove the heat exchangers 
to get the fan housing off, or is there some hidden bolt I am missing. 
The fan housing wobbles now, but I can't seem to get it to pull forward 
enough to clear the studs so I can pull it up. Any help would be 
appreciated.

In the mean time, I am off to the pressure washers to clean up and paint 
my tinware. I figure I might as well do it while it is all off, as I 
hope to not take it off again any time soon. :~)
