&gt; well I found used a 1979 auto trans. for my 1975 bus.  sounds like the guy

&gt; someone told me that i need the shifter because that is not interchangable, 
&gt; but in Bentley it says something about all shifters are the same for 
&gt; automatics in buses.  maybe i am wrong about that... If someone could clear 
&gt; this up for me that would be great.
&gt; 
&gt; I amconsidering buying it without the shifter and start the hunt for the 
&gt; shifter...or should I hold out for the whole package?  what do you think 
&gt; listees?

a 79 will be able to use a 75 shifter if parts are removed from it, but
far better to find a 79 shifter, they are different
