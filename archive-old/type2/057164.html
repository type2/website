&gt;My question is, &quot;What, if anything needs to be done to a bus (carburated
&gt;1600DP) when traveling up in the mountains?&quot;  George relates to crossing the

&gt;you have to change timing or anything like that to get it to run right?
&gt;Modern cars with their fuel injection and computer controlled ignition don't
&gt;seem to have any problems (other than being a bit down on power).  I remember
&gt;in the &quot;old days&quot; that you would have to do something like rejet the carb and
&gt;change the timing to get it to run good.

Last year I drove my bus over an 11,000 ft pass in Colorado.  The
difference between that elevation and sea level is that at 11k the bus
idles at about 700rpm instead of the usual 1300, and has about 1/2 the
power, even less at low RPMs.  It would help to rejet the carbs but it's
not really practical to do on trips, unless you are spending lots of time
at high elevations.  I'd just make sure you are not running rich at lower
elevations and then just put up with the effects of altitude.
