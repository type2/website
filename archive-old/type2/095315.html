Subject: Steering Dampener

Hi All.

I just ordered a steering dampener from Bus Depot and I have a question.
My 70 Westy came with it missing. What should I 
specifically use for hardware to bolt this in when it arrives? Oh, and I
stopped
at a local VW dealer to check for this part. Guy made a show of looking it
up, 
writing down the number and after leaving the parts area and coming back in,
told me
nobody makes it anymore. I said thanks for looking and ran back to my
computer to
order it. 

Thanks

Jeff
