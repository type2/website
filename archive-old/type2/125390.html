Subject: Hitch Question (Was: Driveway blues)

From: &quot;Mark L. Hineline&quot; &lt;hineline_at_ocotillofield_dot_net&gt;
&gt; Hmm, I doubt it. I would use a come-along, attached to a fixed point,
&gt; and do it VERY slowly, like a ratchet click every 30 seconds or so.
&gt; Because it's a heavy-gauge steel, working with a hammer is likely to be
&gt; an exercise in frustration.

I tried a small come-a-long, but could only take some of the bend out of the
end of the bumper where it got mushed into the body.  I then used a chain
with hooks on the end.  I double-wrapped the chain around a post in the
driveway, and used 1st gear to get the bus rolling forward.  Used the clutch
to sort of bounce the bus on the chain.  After a few of these, moving the
chain a couple of times, I got the bumper pretty much back to where it was
prior to the incident.

The body on the right, under the battery tray, is bent in.  Looks like it'll
need some body work to get it back out to where it belongs.

Thanks for the encouragement.

Got a question, too.  My hitch is welded to the bumper and to a metal
beam-thing just behind the bumper.  It's pulled out a bit (not from my
efforts, but from towing something by the PO).  It's got a 1 7/8&quot; ball on
it.  I can't imagine it taking much towing weight.  Does anyone else have a
bumper hitch of this sort and know what you can safely tow with it?
