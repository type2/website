	The loop I used was about 2&quot; in diameter, maybe a bit bigger, so thats
25mm radius, 5 times the hose's diameter, but still stressing the hose,
no question. I put it in a loop because it looked like that would be
lower-stress than a straight run, but I may have erred. I'll try
a straight run. Since I bought this bus as a glider with the former engine
in a cardboard box, I don't even have previous work to go by :)

	For general information, the parts book also shows a 'protector'
(plastic or rubber at a guess?) and a loop fitting to hold the original 
steel line in place somewhere between the firewall and the fuel pump.
I know I don't have one, but I'm going to look for the screw hole it should
have mounted to... maybe on the shroud? Seems like a good idea.

	Of course, I checked my firewall gromet when I did the engine compartment
check. A Hover-style bulkhead fitting is on my list after I take care of
the bed rust. &quot;www.por15_dot_com&quot; is the answer. I'm going to try their eval
kit on the under-pedal protector plate (down is down) :)

	Every time I think this truck is too much trouble (and its no T*****)
I drive it and it comes back to me why I got involved with this project
in the first place. There's no replacement for a bubble bus except another.

&gt; You should replace the looped hose with a straight one.  Hoses don't
&gt; take kindly to being bent too tightly.  I think that the rule of thumb
&gt; is that the hose should not be bent in a radius tighter than 5 times
&gt; its outside diameter.
