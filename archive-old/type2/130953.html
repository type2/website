Subject: she's bleeding!

My 70 Campmobile hadn't leaked a drop of oil until i took it in for a tune 
up about 2 weeks ago. While there i had them change the oil, and now i am 
bleeding oil. Added up i think it has dropped about a quart. The dipstick is 
still on full, and she is leaking right in front of the oil strainer cover. 
Is this somthing i need to worry about? and if so, what gaskets might need 
to be replaced? I am kinda looking forward to dropping the engine out of her 
anyway...Gotta learn sometime :)

Thanks
Alex
