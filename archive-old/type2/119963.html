&gt; Greetings,

&gt; What is the largest motor that will not over-heat in a 1971 Westy?

The largest version of the type 1 engine built in Germany was the 1600.
This engine was engineered as pretty much the largest displacement that
could be reliable on a type 1 case.  When VW wanted more power they
designed the type IV case, so it is pretty clear that the 1600 is the
largest displacement that will yield adequate reliability in a production
engine, at least from the VW engineer's point of view.

Now, if you always drive in a cool climate, want to put a lot of money
into an engine, and know what you are doing as far as tuning and setup,
you might be able to get away with larger displacements.  There is no
hard and fast answer to how big you can go, however.  Everything is a
tradeoff between hassle, expense, and power.  Speed costs money, how fast
do you want to spend?

George
