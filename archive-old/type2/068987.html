Subject: Re: '67 color schemes

&gt; Has anyone compiled a list of factory offered paint 
schemes for a '67 bus?
&gt; 

Dave Easterwood has just put up a very comprehnsive list on 
colour schemes on busses from 1950 -&gt; 1967, although there 
are a few bugs to work out on the page overallit is is very 
impressive.

Thanks Dave!
