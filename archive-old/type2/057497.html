Subject: Administrivia - Boy am I tired.

Volks,

For the first time this week, I have been able to reach the account from
which the list is administered.  As a result, I am able to deal with the
76 personal notes, 14 offlist posts, 4 moderated posts (a category which
is about to get *much larger :-(, and *527*!!! bounce messages.

First, we are having major server problems.  About 1/6th of the list is
currently cut off because of a dead name-server.  Obviously , none of them
will see this message, unless they stop by the findmail site and see it
there. If you are one of these lost souls, and are reading this on the
findmail site, *we are working on it*, and I have a list of those
affected.  Once the problem is solved, I will try to re-add the group in
its entirety.  I do apologize, and we are doing all we can.

Second, I am sorry to say that the events of this past weekend have
wrought a change in me.  I had hoped to be &quot;the invisible administrator&quot;
and do as little to alter the course of discussion here as possible.  This
list has always has a very genteel rep and the subscribers are by and
large adults.  The problem is that as time passes, and people come and go
that character is changing.  Folks, if nothing else, I would like civility
to be a hallmark of this list.  If you &quot;go ad hominem&quot; as debaters call
it, you will be banned.  In public.  Argue the merits, the technology, or
the physics all day long and I won't do a thing.  Go for the cheap insult
and I guarantee you will bounce twice.

Third, killed is killed.  After you see a &quot;kill this message&quot; post *-from
me*- stop posting!  I will allow about a half hour lag for messages still
in the pipe, after that measures will be taken.  As a side issue, please
do not post &quot;kill this thread&quot; messages.  If you think a thread has gone
on too long, please write to me at both this address and the
dworkin_at_ari_dot_net address.
