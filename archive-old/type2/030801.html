Message-ID: &lt;Pine.GSO.4.10.9906140719070.13684-100000_at_ux13.cso.uiuc_dot_edu&gt;

info:  stock 69 westy.  1600 single port, newer brazilian carb, stock
single vacuum advance distributor, stock muffler and exhaust.

my problem is that the last two times i have driven the bus, after about
30 minutes, it just totally loses power in 4th gear.  the engine starts to
&quot;buck&quot; i.e., cuts out then revs up.  i was watching the tach last time it
happened, and it was at around 3200 rpm.  if i slow down to 45 mph or so,
i dont seem to have any problem.  then after a few miles, everything is
back to normal, and i can continue on my way at 55 mph or so.

at first i thought my motor was overheating, but im not sure of that.  i
can still touch the dipstick when i pull over.  could i have a loose valve
or even vapor lock of some sort?  next time that i am home from school, i
am planning to give it a tune up and install a new fuel filter, but is
there anything else i should be looking for?

thanks.
