I found I could increase the heat comfort level with a simple curtain.

Find some material that you like and enough stretchy curtain cable and two hooks to screw into it so that it will reach from behind the drivers head to behind the passengers head.

Cut the material in a &quot; T &quot; shape so that from about roof level it will drape across the back of the seats and down into the passageway to the floor.  For ease of rear access split the curtain down the middle.  Roll it up when not in use.

If more heat is required place a catalytic heater in the back.  If left on it will require filling once a day.

When stopping and sleeping overnight put the heater in front of the passengers seat.  For a heat shield, hang a piece of aluminum foil from the glove box to something on the front. *** WARNING *** Open both front windows at least 3/4 inch or you will die from lack of oxygen :)

This has worked well for me down to 0 degrees F.
