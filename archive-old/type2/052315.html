Subject: [T2] Cylinder spacers...the solution, thanks all

Well, the replies I got indicate that the fewer interfaces, the better for 
sealing, plus one answer stated that even a head gasket isn't really 
necessary.

So, if I use one .090&quot; (largest I could find in any catalog; .100&quot; would be 
better) base spacer and leave out the head gasket and the stock base shims, 
I'll get 7.5:1 CR. Further, that puts the &quot;stack&quot; back very near factory 
specs, so the valve train geometry will remain correct.

&gt;From what I've read that this isn't too high for regular gas if I am careful 
with the timing. That is what I'll do if there's no downside to it.

Any comments??? ToobWiz_at_aol_dot_com

Thaks for all the helpful advice, T2 folks ;-)
