Look no further than your local wrecker.  I took a set from an Audi (VW
and Audis use virtually the same belts) for the front seats and a set from
a VW Sirocco for the back seat.  the bracket required a little rework
(turned the inertia reel 90 degrees) but the result was well worth it!

Don't take belts from a car displaying a heavy hit for obvious reasons.

Right side and Left side inertia reels are the same, so if you get the
Rights from two different cars they will show a lot less wear.  (Lefts for
those who drive on that side)
