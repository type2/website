&gt; Please please please can someone assist me..... I have a lovely Vdub bus 
&gt;  - Westafalia - registered in UK August 1973, however, I do know that she 
&gt;  was manufacutured in 1972 - Hence I should be exempt from road tax.  
&gt;  Apparently I need proof  (a 'dealers letter' is not adequate). 
&gt;  
&gt;  If you can help it would be much appreciated
&gt;  I'll let you know chassis number etc, at mo I dont have it to hand
&gt;  Thanks

Hi Rachel,

I'm posting this to list in the hope because I'm sure it will become a FAQ for
UK folk on the list, and if its in the archive then there is a remote
possibility that some one will look there;-)

For those not in the UK if you ran a vehicle MANUFACURED before 1 January 1973
then you are exempt from UK road tax.

If the age of your vehicle is doughtful then there are two things you can
either get a 'birth certificate' from VW - lots in the archives on how to do
that. OR you can get acceptable certification.

Acceptable certification can be supplied by authorised individuals within
clubs for the type of vehicle the club  represents. Certification can be
provided by the Volkswagen Type 2 Owners Club for Type 2s (AND ONLY TYPE 2s)
send an E-mail to Phil_Shaw_3_at_Compuserve_dot_com and ask him how to proceed. You
will definetly need to tell him your chassis number.

Good luck,
Bob

Appologies for this being slightly off topic.
