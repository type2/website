&gt; I took a small road trip this past weekend to test the 77 2L engine that I 
&gt; recently installed into my 75 westy. After about 90-100 miles I noticed 
&gt; some hesitation and the flashing of the oil light.
&gt; ...We towed it home and today I did a compression test. 100 in 
&gt; cylinders 1,3,and 4 105 in cylinder 2. Muir says that this light flashing 
&gt; at high idle means overhaul time but how can I need an overhaul with Good 
&gt; compression in all cylinders.
&gt; ...does anyone have any advice. Please be gentle.
&gt; I mentioned a pretty good oil leak when hot. 
&gt; coming from the rear of the  engine.

Well, since it's the oil pressure that's suffering, the oil leak shoud get
first attention.  Perhaps you've got a gallery plug popped partially out
which is letting the pressure out.  I wouldn't run the engine again until
you have traced the leak.

You should also check the pressure relief and control valves to be sure
that they are free.

The oil pressure sender is also a suspect.  Sometimes they're just
incorrect.
