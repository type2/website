&lt;&lt; Bry's VW  boneyard right here in Seattle has heaps of distributors - so
 many that
 when I went to pay ($25) for the correct one, the nice fellow says &quot;Take
 two for the price&quot;.  I did.  They have many - all sorted by app/part#.  Had
 at least two dozen of the one I needed.

if anyone is in the seattle area and is going to go to brys boneyard, i would 
appreciate you picking up a dizzy for me.  let me know...i ll throw in a 
little something extra for your trouble.  let me know.  thanks....zac
