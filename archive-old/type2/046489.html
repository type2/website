Subject: [T2] ceramic coating

Gentlepersons-
                      Any engine rebuilders out there familiar with ceramic 
coatings? I came across a site but lost it (digilliterate that I am). 
Specifically, a DIY kit that can be baked
on engine parts after media blasting (...?) I THOUGHT the product name was 
&quot;Tec-Line&quot;
or &quot;Tech-Line&quot;. The site had an owner building up an OHC Kent engine and 
after installing
it had cooling problems...The engine ran too cool !! You might see how this 
affected my
VW radar...'ey?
Any help would be appreciated and if I find it again I'll be sure to post it 
to the list for di-
section/discussion.
