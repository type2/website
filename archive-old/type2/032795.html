Subject: Trade Used '79 Air Flow Meter for Used '81-'83 Air Flow Meter

Hi all,
I just bought an '83 Vanagon (air cooled) from a relative.  So, I'm new to Vanagons and this list.
It came with an Air Flow Meter (AFM) from a '79 which, it turns out, is incompatible with the '83 engine control unit.  (Huge clouds
of smoke from the exhaust. Undriveable.)  If anyone wants to trade me an '81 - '83 AFM for my '79 AFM, I'll pay the shipping.
Alternatively, if anyone can recommend a reputable salvage yard with reasonable rates, please let me know.  Otherwise, it looks like
I spend about $170 and give up a perfectly good &quot;core&quot;.

If you can help me out, please respond off the list to andye_at_inxpress_dot_net.
