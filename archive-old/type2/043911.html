Not to rain on your parade, Tom and Dana, but AVP isn't faultless either.
They seem to think they can build just about everything. I have recently
seen two repeat AVP long blocks fail for a Mercruiser engine from them.
The mechanic found loose valve train fasteners on the first one and sent it
back when I pointed out to him the Mexican reman heads on the Chevy block.
That was after the head gaskets blew immediatly upon start up. The second
one knocked right out of the box, and installed by a seasoned jouneryman
mechanic of good report and well recommended in the area. His only mistake
was to not check what should have been properly torqued fasteners, in both
cases. If they can't bolt together a Chevy properly every time, they have
no business touching a German motor ever.
