Subject: Engine reinstallation questions

I'm getting ready to put my 1.8L engine back into the '73 after a long
rebuild.  I'm now cleaning up stuff in the engine compartment, and sorting
out a bit of a wiring mess in the rear lighting harnesses.
It's been about a year since I removed the engine, and I have the following
questions:
1. what parts of the rear of the engine is it recommended one leave off
until the engine is attached to the tranny and supported by the crossmember
(oil filler tube, oil dipstick, front cooling tins?)
2. where does the large rubber hose coming back from the brake vacuum
booster connect to, on the engine?
3. there is a silver box mounted on the firewall on the passenger side, with
a three wire connector on the bottom.  What is its purpose, as I don't see
any wires to connect to it?
4. the foam seal around the opening for the engine is installed after the
engine is in place, right?
THanks a lot.  Any other tips for engine re-install would be greatly
appreciated.
  --Robert
