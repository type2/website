Subject: Re: Who makes the best front rotors for '72 bus? And think I
  can do it myself?

 &gt;Also, I have the factory blue manual, plus the Haynes,
and the Muir books and consider myself pretty handy.
Do you think rotors/pads is a job do-able at home?

Yes. As long as you've got a safe place to leave the bus where it is 
out of the weather and wont fall on someone overnight! Make sure you 
do a good search through the archives and on theSamba and 
ShopTalkForums to uncover all the traps and tips before tackling the 
job. I would also consider reco'ing the calipers and checking the 
front bearings while you're at it.

Martin.
