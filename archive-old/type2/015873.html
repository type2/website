Subject: Worn Tappets
Message-Id: &lt;3.0.6.32.19990515183651.007b0a60_at_iu_dot_net&gt;

I have a 1980 Vanagon air-cooled: I have removed the rocker shafts and a
visual inspection of the tappets reveals that all are worn - one worn flat
and mushroomed.  The Haynes Repair Manual states that if metal particles
are found in the sump (I believe I have found some of the mushrooming metal
there), that the hydraulic lifters should be disassembled and cleaned.  

My question is - Would it be better to install all new lifters and at the
same time new tappets?  If I purchase new lifters, is it necessary to
disassemble and bleed them before installing?  Are the tappets case
hardened and when this wears through, is this the cause of the mushrooming?
I had a local mechanic install new lifters a time back, I believe it was
his shoddy work that caused the pushrod tubes to leak which is why I am in
there now. I had considerable noise from the tappets and a lot of noise
when the oil was down to the add mark, which happened  often due to the oil
leak. Is there any hope for this motor, It seems to run strong and another
mechanic recently checked it over and told me it was ready for a 7000 mile
trip!
