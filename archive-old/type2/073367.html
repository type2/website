Hey list-

Interesting thread.  I've never had a problem getting *regular*  liability
insurance on our van.  Antique insurance may be another kettle o'
fish......bag o' snakes....._dot_can o' worms.    I was turned down when I
tried to add the Fridge to my antique policy with JC Taylor.  &quot;We do not
insure VW vans&quot; or something to that effect.  I wondered if it had to do
with the rep of VW busses or what.  I didn't really pursue it, although I
may.  I've had the policy at JCT for years, too - no claims.  Has anyone
else had experience with the antique  insurance companies?  Inquiring
plumbers want to know.
