Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for an engine- AVP?

GEX at one time WAS an excellent engine builder.  I know, because I use to
hang around their shop as a when I first into VWs professionally (a long
time ago in a galaxy far, far away.....if you can call Baldwin Park, CA that
;-)...).  I grew up just a mile or so from their facility and used several
of their engines from the 70s thru early 80s.  It was in the mid 80s after
management/ownership changes that their quality went downhill (actually
tailspin is a better term).

&gt; I can't help but wonder if it was just a matter of more business than
&gt; they can handle. A couple years ago they were VERY well regarded. Then
&gt; word got out, Bus Depot carried their engines, and things started
&gt; slipping.
&gt; Heck, GEX probably started out with good engines too...
