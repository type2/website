If I am not mistaken,, if your talking about the &quot;frontboot&quot; where the rod
enters the booster from the pedal. you shouldn't have any fluid there!

That circlip holds the vent tube connector in place.

I might hazard a guess that the old master cylinder was leaking out the
front, between the master and the servo,, this puts fluid IN the servo,
and should not be there,,

I have always drained this fluid off,, but recently Karl mentioned that
the fluid will cause damage,

My method is to remove the master cyl,  use a steel line with a bend in it
so it reaches the bottom of the servo,, and siphon the fluid out of the
servo..
It has worked fine for me, but I didn't know it was bad for the &quot;valves&quot;
in the servo until Karl pointed that out.
I have drained servo's that had fluid running out the big hole...

&gt; &gt; I know the servo works on vacume  [VACUUM] {and NOT}
&gt;&gt;  pressure and though it was strange to have fluid inside it.  The level is
&gt;&gt;  about 1 inch below where the hole for the master cylinder mounts to.  Any
&gt;&gt;  ideas? or anyone run into this before?  Will the brake fuild damage the
&gt;&gt;  servo?
&gt;
&gt; Any brake fluid in the booster means a bad master cylinder. Replace it.
&gt; Brake fluid above a certain mm level will destroy the valves in the
booster. If yours is an inch below the &gt; big
&gt; hole, I would NOT use it. How did you even get the bus to stop?? That
much fluid will cause a hydraulic lock
&gt; and the master will not move before the pedal travel locks up.
&gt; Replace the booster now.
