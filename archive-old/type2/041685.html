Subject: Re: piston ring placement

Alex Wisniewski sends:

&gt; I ordered a new set of piston rings, the 25$ set. The oil ring is 3 parts not
&gt; 1, in the instructions it says to put the middle part of the oil ring
&gt; positioned so that the split is by the piston pin. Then it says put the top
&gt; part of the oil ring 1 inch to the right of the split and the bottom one 1
&gt; inch to the left. That makes one of the rings at the bottom of the piston.
&gt; Isn't it bad to have a oil ring set up so that the split is at the bottom of
&gt; the piston bore?
&gt; 
&gt; In the Muir he says something totally different. Yes I know he's not always
&gt; right but its the only book that talks about what position the rings are
&gt; supposed to be in.
&gt; 
&gt; I am confused, what is the right placement of the rings so I dont burn oil,
&gt; and compression isnt lost?

&quot;Correct&quot; ring gap placement is like &quot;best&quot; beer--it depends on who you're
talking to at the time. Here's what I do.

Step one is to separate the rings into five piles: two piles of thick rings,
two piles of real thin chromoly rings, and one pile of crinkly rings.

Step two is (spam ahead!) to go to http://www.aircooled_dot_net (who I know has
'em) or http://www.busdepot_dot_com (who can definitely get 'em) and order a set
of Total Seal second rings. These are two-piece rings that, when installed
properly, have *no* effective ring gap at all. (Each ring has a gap; when
you stagger the two rings during installation the gap closes.)

Step three is to wait till the rings arrive. Then go to the next step, which
is...

To put the crinkly ring into the oil scraper gap (closest to the case)
followed by the two chromoly rings. I point the crinkly ring gap straight
up, and stagger the two chromoly rings so that, using the clock method, one
is pointing at 11 and one at 1. I then put the Total Seal ring in the middle
gap so that one of the gaps is at three and one at nine, and the top ring
pointing at either 1:30 or 10:30. With the Total Seal ring in, the gap on
the top ring isn't too critical.

Take the remaining four rings and put them in your TV repairman's toolbox.
(You always have parts left over when you fix a TV, right?)
