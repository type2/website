I suspect it would be easier to use both engine and tranny than to mate
the late engine to the early tranny.

why not use the stock cooling system ??

&gt; Hi ,
&gt; I have been following the thread about putting an upright into a late 
&gt; baywindow.  I want to do just the opposite.  I have a good, strong type 4 
&gt; engine that I was planning to do an upright conversion and put it into a 
&gt; splittie.  I would like to use it in my '71 Deluxe, that I use to commute 
&gt; 115 miles a day.  I will still use an upright conversion fan shroud but 
&gt; what to do with the tranny?  I need to support it for the additional weight 
&gt; of the pancake.  Is it possible to use a late bay tranny with the hanger in 
&gt; my '71? Thanks
&gt; 
&gt; Joy thru Air,
