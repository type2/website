Subject: anybody have a 40 HP engine case??  new supercharger=new motor

i am in need of a new engine case for my bug.  it is hard to find 40HP
cases so i am apealing to you all out there.  i want to find either a
good short/long block, or a good case to rebuild from.  i will even try a
old dead unit if the price is right (read cheap). anyone out
there able to help.  i would prefure so_dot_cal, but will listen to all who
reply.

i am building a stock 40HP motor for my 64 bug (original owner) with a
judson supercharger on it.  since i have a crack in the old case 
(oil in &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; oil out) i need a new one.

thanks in advance.

Take care and God Bless
