Subject: Distributer Problem...Help

A cpl of weeks ago I replaced my heat exchanger (to many holes) and, yup, a 
exhaust stud snapped...*&amp;%&amp;%!!$.  Finally had to remove the head and got it 
out and replaced the stud..but...I have a single port Vacuum Dist (205S). On 
reassembly, It fired right up, and idled, but Only 20 deg of advance. Upon 
testing, the only advance was the vacuum. The Centrifical was not kicking in 
at all, it worked fine before dissasembly. the timing and everything is set 
up right (as before)...Is there something Im missing?  is my dizzy broke? 
Help would be deeply appreciated.
Aloha
