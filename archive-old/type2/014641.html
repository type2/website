It is a classic scene to see a VW broken down on the side of the road
somewhere, at least in the US anyway, but the thing about them is, they ARE
reliable, and they almost never leave you stranded.  I went back to my bus a
few hours later that I pushed off the road, managed to get it started, and it
drove fine the rest of the way home, so of course they're excellent, but like
any 26 year old car, things break in it, in my case there must be something
wrong with the fuel system, i'll keep everyone posted on my progressive if
they care.

Thanks,
Shawn

&lt;&lt; Huh? I've been driving type-2s since 1981, riding in my parent's ones
 since before I was born and as far as I can recall I've called out a tow
 once (dropped valve: my fault for taking Muir at his word) and maybe
 two or three times my bus hasn't started when I wanted it to.
  I think my mum called the AA once for a broken clutch cable, we could
 have carried on, of course, but the van was fully loaded and we were
 about to drive onto a car ferry...
 
  In the UK VW have a long running advertising campaign &quot;Isn't it a pity
 everything in life isn't as reliable as a Volkswagen&quot;. This has passed
 into general conversation.
 
  That's one of the major plus points of a bus for me- you turn the key
 and it goes. I always get a kick out of cruising by a nearly-new,
 watercooled car that's dead at the roadside.
  Now if you'd said MG, or Triumph.. &gt;&gt;
