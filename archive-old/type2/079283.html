Subject: engine stand for sale

I have for sale a engine stand that I bought from Bus Depot last year. I
never used it. It's the floor model with two arms. It did
get a little dirty in the garage. I'd like to get $50.00 for it. I paid
75.00. I will ship if needed.but may take a week to mail.
I'd also trade for some green plaid fabric or towards a front
table.LOCATION MYSTIC,CT.

Thanks,
Bill M
