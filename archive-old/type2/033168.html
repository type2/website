For Sale:

1969 VW Bus, Westfalia camper. Forest Green lower with white upper and top.
5000 miles on Rebuilt 1600cc Engine.

Engine features full-flow oil filtration with CB performance/Schadek oil
pump, 009 distributor, Pertronix ignitor electronic ignition, &quot;pressure
oiling type&quot; swivel-foot valve adjusters, dual port heads with new exhaust
valves, 34 PICT-3 carburator, doghouse oil cooler, and Bosch alternator. I
have recorded gasoline mileage at 21-25 MPG, depending on terrain. (I am in
Vermont and it is hilly and mountainous here.)

Camper features Pop-top with the overhead cot, full-height enclosed
cabinetry in place of the sink/ice box, 4-foot-long flourescent lighting
strip instead of the tiny incandescant, new deep maroon upholstery on
fold-down bed/rear seat and jumpseat, nicely patterned color-matched
curtains. Interior is not &quot;perfect&quot; but is very clean and in excellent used
condition.

Bus body itself is in surprisingly rust-free condition: there are no areas
of rot through the body except for some pinholes where the passenger side
rear inner wheelwell meets the outer body and under the battery, the frame
is not crusty anywhere, the heat tube is 97% rust free (the heat works,
BTW). I have fully serviced the wheel bearings and front end- right rear
wheel inner bearing could use replacing (and I have a German replacement
for it).

What does it need? You can drive it everyday and use it &quot;as is&quot; now. I
have- that's how it got 5000 miles on the engine ;) But, if I were able to
keep this bus (my original plan) I would replace some rubber seals and a
few other minor things, as well as the pop-top canvas. I also would install
new heater boxes and muffler as they are not in great shape; heat works but
is not 100% and the boxes themselves leak slightly. Cosmetically, the paint
really is not that impressive, and since the platform is in such solid
condition, it should be repainted when the few minor dings and small
wrinkles are repaired and while the windows are out for new seals. The
brakes are good, but the drums could use turning; there is a mild &quot;pulsing&quot;
when the brakes are applied hard.

I am asking $2500 or best reasonable offer. You would be hard pressed to
find a bus this solid in the northeast! I need the cash due to marital
issues. I don't really want to part with it but it is unfortunately
necessary. Email me with your interest.
