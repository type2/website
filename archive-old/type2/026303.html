Hope you guys aren't getting tired of my general philosophical posts;-0

Regarding the slanted H shift patterns.

My Dad used to give me Royal Sh*t if he ever caught me holding the shift
knob.
He taught me to only push, pull , or guide the shift knob with an open palm.

His reasoning was that if you hold it, you get to where you are trying to
put it 
into a specific place, and if you ever drive another vehicle, you'll have
trouble shifting
because this won't be where the gate is. If you guide it in the right
direction, for examp;e
to go from second to third, you push it up, and to the right, with your open
palm
and the shifter gates will take care of where it should go.
I did this when I was younger, and was able to drive a variety of cars and
trucks with no trouble.
When I got older, and owned, and drove a single car I stopped doing this
with no problems until
I moved in with my girlfriend. Third gear on her Honda was exactly where
first gear was on my car, and
I almost got shmucked a few times as I tried to pull away form a stop street
in third gear, in an old Civic
 no less. Then I stopped holding the knob, and the problem went away. I
could drive either car with no trouble.
Hell I can even move form a short throw sports car shift to the milktruck
style VW shifter - if I remember to lean my
body far enough in the VW to reach third gear;-)

Note: when really trying to step out quickly, I'll grab the knob on the
shift from 1st to 2nd, but I'm also snapping
my arm, and preloading the shifter  just before I release  the clutch. This
does not apply to VW vans, or to cars
that you want the transmission to last a long time in, becasue it is a bit
hard on the old gear box;-( But
it will shave a fraction of a second off the shift.
