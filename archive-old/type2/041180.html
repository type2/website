&gt; Could I apply the brake cleaner WITHOUT removing the new pads and see if

Well, removing the pads will just make it easier to clean the rotors.  That
coating is on every surface of that rotor, and it should be removed.  I'd hate
for the rotor to glue itself to the hub because that stuff got hot.

    As for the pads, you might try using the brake cleaner to get most of the
goo off, then sanding.  Maybe spray it on a rag first.  I worry about the glue
holding the pad to the metal plate, but I don't think brake cleaner will hurt
it.

Happy trails.
