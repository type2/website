Subject: Re: [T2] Dizzy?

034 means nothing. What are all the numbers on the housing, either the 10 digit Bosch number or the 9 + one or
two letters VW number?



&gt; Since everybody has been saying that the 009 is a little wishy washy and that  some hesitation is to be
expected I decided to look around for something different and have found a 034 vacuum advance dizzy for $66.00
and was wondering first if this will fit my 69 1600 engine and secondly if that is a good price.
