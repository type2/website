Subject: [T2] Perring Road Trip

Just a short update on what is developing as far as Mary Beth and I trying 
to incorporate a family get together in the middle of our &quot;2001, A Bus 
Odyssey&quot; trek........

Looks like we will be getting together with the entire family somewhere in 
the San Juan Islands area.
That seems to be pretty much a given at the moment.
As to when, well, I am staying out of the decision loop. :-)

Thank you ............ Everyone !
for giving Mary Beth and I such detailed feedback so as to assist us in 
putting the wheels in motion to get the family to join us,
as opposed to our having to jump through hoops to get across to the other 
side of the country during our trek.

Details later, as the gelatin cures :-)
