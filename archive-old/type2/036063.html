Subject: alternator problems.


&gt; it completely disconnected except for the plug, which seams to be behind
&gt; part of the engine tin attatched to the alternator it self which was
&gt; hooked up to the fan shroud and looks like it was suposed to blow air
&gt; through it to keep it clean. now my problem is how do i get it off so i
&gt; can put the new one back on. There's probably some trick that im
&gt; missing....

You have to disconnect the harness from the bus and the remove the
alternator. Then you remove the back cover and transfer the harness to the
new alternator. The harness goes up thru a hole in the cylinder tin....has
the plug for regulator and the heavy wire going to the starter.
