Subject: Re: [T2] if it ain't one thing...


&gt;be advised there are parts around it that need to be replaced as well. i
&gt;had to replace the gen stand with an alt stand, the fuel pump had to be
&gt;replaced because my 70 bus one was too tall for the new lower position of
&gt;the alternator. i am sure there were other things that had to be changed,
&gt;but as far as i can remember, those were the only parts i had to
&gt;replace...
&gt;
&gt;QUESTION: is the alt generally a 12v or 6v or does it matter?

Yes 12 volts is different from 6 volts and I don't think there was ever a 6 
volt alternator.
