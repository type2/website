Subject: Propane tank restore/paint

Can someone direct me to a listmember's website that has done a vanagon
propane tank restore and paint? I remember seeing it once, a year or two
back.

I'm adding a 2nd propane tank to my westy, thanks to Matt Bushore. Thanks
Matt!! Added tank is for a vented propane heater.

I looked in the lib and archives, but did not see anything.

TIA
