&gt; BTW, will a Torx bit fit those 12-point bolt heads?
&gt; 
&gt; NO! TORX is not the same as 12 point. Try your local
&gt; Mac or Snap-On professional tool service. To make sure
&gt; you get the right size, ideally bring a bolt with you.
&gt; The hex-head version uses a 6mm hex driver, so odds are
&gt; you want a 6mm 12 point star driver.

You need an 8mm 12 point, not 6mm for CV's.
