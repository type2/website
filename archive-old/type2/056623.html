Subject: Re: Starter/Solenoid - '79 bus

OK, I just went through this on my '80 (which is the same setup, I believe).  My preferred vendor sent me a Bosch reman. unit (# SR78X, I think) that had one tab instead of two.  He correctly told me that one could put the starter wire and the small, blue and brown wire on the same connector without any ill effects (check your wiring diagram).  I've seen a female to two male &quot;T&quot; connector at FLAPS before which would be perfect for this.  Apparently, my vendor's supplier cannot guarantee whether or not the starter will come with one or two connectors, so I ended up going to a mega-type parts store and got the 2 connector model (it was a Bosch, but remanufactured by another company).

I also crimped all new connectors onto the wires going to the solenoid and a Bosch WR1 hot start relay kit.  You could scrounge all of the WR1 parts for less, but it comes with everything you need.  Now my van cranks like a champ!

While I was under there, I noticed that the transmission to engine ground strap was looking pretty spent.  Has anyone ever replaced one of these?  Is this a generic deal or does someone know of a Vanagon specific part?

HTH,

John
