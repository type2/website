Subject: Lower my 73 Transporte suspension.

Hi everybody !!

It is nice to belong in a place where all speak the same  &quot;VW language&quot;.

I have recently bought a 1973 Transporter with the original 1700cc type
IV engine. It is doubled carb with a Solex PDSIT/2 as most of you should
know (I'm new in VW's).  This van is in pretty good shape (body, engine
and mechanical) and little restoration has to be done to it (mostly
upholstery).

One of the most important project that I have in mind is to lower it
about 2 or 3 inches and need some advise. Can anyone give me a hint on
this ??.  I can go on and do the rear job with no problem but the front
is what freaks me, I understand it needs some cutting and welding.  I'm
ready to listen to any suggestion on how should I start.

Also, one of the things that I need is the paper air filter element.
This filter is not found in Venezuela.  It is perfectly square and there
is no other model or brand of car in this country that uses this size of
filter (I've gone every where).  Any help on this will be highly
appreciated.

Thanks in advance for any commentary.

Regards,
Pedro Vivas.
Caracas - Venezuela.
