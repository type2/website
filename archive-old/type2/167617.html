&gt; Hi, I just put in a new coil. The Bosch Blue one, part #9 220 081 083 (0

&gt; Since I put it in, my tach. jumps around all over the place when the
&gt; engine is under load,especially at higher rpms. With just straight
&gt; cruising and not under load it's fine. In a couple of weeks I'll be
&gt; going on a road trip and was wondering if anyone else has had that? I
&gt; would like to get this resolved now instead of a breakdown somewhere in
&gt; the middle of nowhere. Maybe I'm worried about it for nothing, but just

take a good spare and it will never go bad...
