Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Bath Filter



&gt; Hello All,
&gt; Me again.  Someone suggested that my blow by culprit may be caused by a
&gt; plugged air filter.  So , investigating, I have learned a few things, and a
&gt; couple of questions arise.
&gt; Bentley talks about the thermostat and shows a cable.  1971, do not need
&gt; fuel emission where I live.  Where is the cable supposed to come from?  Mine
&gt; is not there.

'71s do not have this cable.

Earlier VWs had a cable that went from the front (FIF) side of the fan shroud to the air filter.  As the flaps in the shroud opened, the flap in 
the air filter was also flipped from &quot;hot&quot; (allowing air from the hot air duct in) to &quot;cold&quot; (allowing air from the air filter snout in).

On '71 buses, this Rube Goldberg arrangement was changed to one in which there was a wax pelllet thermostat built into the air filter that 
moves the same flap in the filter snout.  Mine does not seem to work any more, so I wired the flap permenently to the &quot;hot&quot; position and 
simply remove the hot air duct in the summer (don't forget to plug the hot air duct hole in the tin!).

You can check the hot air thermostat with a heat gun or, I suppose, a hair dryer.  I don't know the opening temperature, however.
