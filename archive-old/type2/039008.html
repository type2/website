Subject: Li'l bit of a trip report, with question

Hey.  I'm back from Florida, and it was not a terribly bad trip in my
westy.  I took some list flyers and did a little propaganda work on the
way (there were some buses in parking lots and rest areas with their
windows open), although I didn't hit as many as I saw.

    The drive down was ok, with the only problem being that by the time
we hit West Virginia we could neither feel our toes nor see out the
windows, and while driving, I noticed we were taking on water from the
lack of seal on the sliding door.  Stopped at Walmart for a twenty
dollar Catalytic heater, which only worked if you sat directly in front
of it.  Used 2 qts of oil each way.  Changed oil in the hotel parking
lot, while many people watched as I lay on the hot pavement.

    Brakes squeaked, but I could only check the driver's side, because
the guys at the tire shop welded my lug nuts on.  Every time I tell
myself I'll make them torque them, and every time i watch them fire them
on with the air gun.  But the brakes were not as bad as they sounded.

    Driving down the beach with the sliding door and rear hatch open,
and the top up with the window unzipped is just about enough to make
everyone turn and look at you.  It was very cool.  Here i have this $900
bus that everyone looks at and waves to, while silly rich kids drive
their big pickups and jeeps and thunderbirds with bright green big flake
metallic paint (that was really cool though) and no one even notices.

    So, since I've owned this bus, it's done this silly engine thing.
While I'm driving, no matter where or when or what gear, it hesitates.
This is terribly hard to explain.  The engine loses power.  It
stutters.  On the highway, when it's hot, sometimes it just stays with
no power, and I can push in the clutch and if I step on the gas I can
either save it or not.  And if I don't, I have to pull over and wait for
five or ten minutes until it will start again.

    It's really weird and you just have to experience it to see what it
is.  Without the clutch in, stepping on the gas does nothing at all.
And the loosing power really slows down the vehicle.  It's like the
engine doesn't want to turn anymore.  I wonder if it's overheating or
something.

    Please let me know what you think, and send me any questions you may
have.

    It's a 77 westy, 2000cc FI.
