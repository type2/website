Subject: Re: [T2] Air-cooled Federal EGR filter and SMOG

&gt; The (&quot;Test Only&quot;) station I took it to has a &quot;pass or free retest&quot; policy so
&gt; once I get the EGR filter hooked up I'm going back, fingers crossed.
&gt;
&gt; As far as the tailpipe test goes I passed the HC and NO parts but failed the
&gt; CO test.
&gt;
&gt; I did all the right things prior to the test: fresh oil, new premium gas,
&gt; timing spot on, long drive to get the engine completely warmed up before
&gt; hitting the test station.  After passing SMOG 2 years I figured I should pass
&gt; this time too - the vehicle sees very little driving - but I turned the CO
&gt; screw on the AFM a quarter turn counterclockwise prior to taking the test
&gt; under the theory that these vehicles tend to get richer as time goes on given
&gt; the AFM internal mechanism.  Since I have no way to test the exhaust itself
&gt; prior to going back I'm going to turn the screw a half-turn more
&gt; counterclockwise.  That's about the best I can do, unless someone has a better
&gt; idea.

crank up the idle a couple hundred rpms
