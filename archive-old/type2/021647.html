Subject: Trailer lights

I know a few of you have trailers and now am wondering how you overcame the 3-2 wiring problem caused by having separate
turn signals and brake lights...

Further, any non-invasive way of doing this?  I've got all kindsa doo-gidgies here (1 set of double filament bulbs with
2 leads each, 1 set of single filament with single leads, a 3-2 converter) and I keep thinking there's some way to make
this work WITHOUT removing the inside taillight covers and hacking the wiring OR making something smoke.  ;-)

I've also mounted and wired separate turn signals on the trailer, if that's a plus.

Any help would be most appreciated.  I need to hit the road for an extended vacation and this is holding me up.

Thanks muchly!

Teri
