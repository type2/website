Subject: Tire sizes

While I was searching for an on-line cross reference chart of tire 
dimensions [seems to be a secret!] I found a couple of interesting 
sites.

If you go http://www.yokohamatire_dot_com/html/plus_sizing.html  it mentions 
changing tire size while keeping the same diameter. Plus zero would be a 
wider tire but the same size height. If you scroll down and click on 
step-by-step, the next page has a chart. If 185/14 is a 80 series tire 
then the 70 series would be a 205, not a 195. I think that 205 is too 
wide for a stock bus rim.

I found another interesting site: http://www.dsm_dot_org/tools/tiresize.htm 
If you enter 185/80/14 it comes back saying that you need a 211mm wide 
tire in a 70's series to have your speedo stay correct.
