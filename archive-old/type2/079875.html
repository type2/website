Subject: Re: [T2] water injection (was alternate fuels)


&gt;If you think about it, water (H2O) when broken down has two parts hydrogen
&gt;&gt;which burns very well and one part oxygen which helps support a flame or
&gt;&gt;burn, and with high combustion chamber temps, doesn't the water brake down
&gt;&gt;like it would under electrolisis (sp?)?

When you combine elements, the properties change completely.  Sodium is 
poisonous while Sodium Chloride is in most of the food we eat.  You can't 
make any assumptions about the properties of a compound based on the 
properties of the elements that make it up.

Water injection is, IMO a kludge to counterract too much compression and 
has no place on a well-built engine.

Bus content - anyone currently use American Collectors Insurance for their 
bus?  They only want $51/year to insure a $3,000 bus (agreed value) with no 
deductable, $300k liability, comp, collision, etc. and the only restriction 
is that it not be a daily driver and no more than 2500 miles per 
year.  Maybe I can afford to keep a second bus after all... ?

-David
