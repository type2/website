Phil,

I had the fortunate pleasure of driving up the don valley (main artery north
out of toronto) and east to Oshawa..

I am sore from the drive...weather recorded winds over 65 mph (110 kph) and
i too have never driven my camper in such high winds....

I took the majority of my lane and the shoulder to navigate my way
home....Lotsa fun, EH?

&gt;Wow. Was it windy here yesterday or what? (Southern Ontario).
&gt;Driving the bus home from work was the most white knuckled ride
&gt;I ever took. Met a transport on the highway doing about 55mph and I was
&gt;pushed by the blast 6 feet toward the ditch. This was followed
&gt;by a 30 min drive to the Southwest with the wind gusting to 100kph
&gt;from the Northwest. I monitored my new engine oil temp gauge and it never
&gt;went above 180 degrees F.
&gt;One car after following me and watching me swerve in the gusts,
&gt;passed me on the Farr left!
 &gt;Anyone else have &quot;fun&quot; driving their bus yesterday in the wind?
