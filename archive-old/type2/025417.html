The Jester, 69 sends:

&gt; Dont any of you follow his example, its a very very very bad idea... (one
&gt; teeny tiny spark and FOOM you are flambe` and dead on the spot or spending
&gt; all your time in a burn unit in excruciating pain until you are dead or
&gt; they patch you up.)

Assuming you survive this, let me tell you *how* they patch you up. (This is
so you get scared enough to not use gasoline for anything but its intended
purpose.)

Before they can graft new skin onto your dumbness, they have to remove the
charred skin that's already there. It's a wonderful process called
&quot;debridement.&quot; They will send in the most heartless nurse in the building to
do it. She will bring a jar of alcohol, a Scotch-Brite Pad and a box of
earplugs. (These are for everyone else in the building.) Oh yeah, and a
little morphine for you, but morphine enough to kill a whole family of polar
bears won't be enough to prepare you for what's next.

Nurse Ratched is going to dip that Scotch-Brite pad into the alcohol and
scrub the burnt skin off you. Now you know what the earplugs are for.

The film the Army Burn Institute made of this procedure (they don't have the
screams on there) was one of our safety NCO's favorites.

Incidentally, Lowe's stores sell mineral spirits in five-gallon cans.
