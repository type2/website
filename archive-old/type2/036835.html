Subject: Re: jalousie window rubbers

well..the difference is that these aren't really seals....they are trim
basically.  fat grey rubber trim that slips on the lip on the inside of the
jals.  it covers all those nasty screws (I think...I've never had mine off)
and makes it look pretty.

I've had a couple offers from people that want to buy them....but I say
no..because I like them...and if someone wants to buy something from me off
of my bus...it usually means that I won't be able to find it elsewhere with
any amount of ease.  ;-)


&gt; Louvered Side Window Seal (68-79 Westfalia), $19.95, 241 522 L/R
&gt; Seal, Center Louvered Window, 68-79 Bus, $22.45, 231 845 413
&gt;
&gt; I'm not quite sure what the difference is.
