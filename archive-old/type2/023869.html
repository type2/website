Ok, you left out several items:

gas cable
heat cables
heat tubes that connect to the heat exchangers
wiring
gas line
also, of the four bolts, the two top are removed from inside the engine
compartment for single port; and for dual port, only the driver side from
engine compartment, the other is a bolt from underneath
finally, depending on year, the transmission may need to be supported
seperately

tex sends:

&gt; Any idea as to how to separate the case from the tranny?.
&gt; 
&gt; tex

Case = &quot;engine case.&quot;

First, remove any rear tin that may impede the engine's moving back. Stick
some sort of engine support device with wheels on it under the middle of
your engine; make sure the engine is firmly planted on it. Crawl under the
Bus and look at where the engine and transmission meet. There are four bolts
that hold them together, two on each side. Remove the four bolts and shove
the engine back.
