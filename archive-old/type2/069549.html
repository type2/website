Hi all,

Just wanted to go on record stating that I LIKE the idea of
dipping a VW bug in the lake to coat it with Zebra mussels for
a museum display. 

I'm a biologist, so I understand well the problems of exotic species
introductions wreaking havoc on local ecology.

I'm a VW head, so I dig the use of a bug as substrate. Much more visually
interesting than, say, a sheet of glass.

The educational point is that these mussels rapidly colonize any available 
substrate in the lake: they are out of control. 

The bug just makes it fun.

Drive safely,
Surfer Bob
