Subject: Fwd:  Re: Breakerless, electronic  ignition

Hi,

&gt;&gt;What I want is capacitance discharge ignition AND breakerless
points but I have never heard them discussed together. I assume it is
done&lt;&lt;

 Certainly is. In fact I have that setup on my '77.

 I think the main reason it's not discussed much is that fitting either
will
likely make your ignition system trouble free. You don't need both, but
there's no harm in it.

 The points act as a switch to time the spark. The coil fires the plugs.
Maintenance of the system is high because switching the coil current
at the necessary rate is difficult to do mechanically, and induces wear.

 The CDI system acts as a spark amplifier: it allows the coil to produce
a fatter spark and simultaneously reduces the switching load on the 
points. The fat spark is nice to have and the load reduction means that
your points last longer, though there is still a little mechanical wear.

 The breakerless ignition replaces the mechanical switch with an 
electronic one (magnetically or optically switched). This removes both
the mechanical and the electrical wear but doesn't affect the size of
the spark, since the coil is being used in exactly the same way (only
with electronic switching instead of mechanical).

 Since the main hassle with points is the electrical wear (arcing),
fitting either of the systems will solve most of your problems.

 Fitting both systems means that the coil is being driven by an
amplifier
that is switched electronically. It gives you the reliability and lack
of maintenence of a modern car's electronic ignition, but without the
performance/economy gains of a proper computer controlled system.

 I fitted a Pertronix first because it was easy to get, then bought a
Tiger 581 CDI module from Universal Corp. It was dead easy to fit the
Pertronix, and only slightly harder to add the Tiger (I can give some
pointers, if required). The Pertronix meant that I didn't have to
futz with the points every couple of weeks and the CDI seemed to help 
winter starting. I noticed no change in mpg, though the fact that the
timing stays on the nose must make a difference.


&gt; It is done.  I'm no expert, but I don't think that the coil is
completely
&gt; replaced.  You still have to have a way to step up the voltage.  Some
of
&gt; these systems (Crane makes one) have their own coil(s).  

 That's right: the coil stays. Crane systems are pricey, I gather, and
OTT
for a bus. 
&gt; I just replaced
&gt; the points on my '73 911 with a Pertronix ingitor. This car came stock
&gt; with CDI ignition, but also has a stock Bosch coil. 

 Hey, another 911 owner! Maybe we should start a sublist for people that
have a 911 and a bus (Sami can join twice... :-).

&gt; ..  If you can find the coil, distributor, and ignition
&gt; module for a '79 and up aircooled bus with california emissions, it
sure is
&gt; a sweet, low maintenance way to go IMHO.

  You can also retrofit the electronics from a rabbit to a bus: check
the
archives for details: I have never studied them as I don't have access
to
the right donor vehicles.

Cheers,
	W.
