Volks,
  I know there is lots of talk about the CHT accuracy especially when you
have to add wire so you have enough to make it to the gauge. Well this is
what I did, I had to add about 2-3 feet of wire to make it my gauge. I took
a candy thermometer and heated up a small pot of oil to 400 deg, took the
pot out to the bus and put the sensor into the oil. My findings where that
the CHT gauge read 25-50 deg hotter than the candy thermometer. Now the
candy thermomter could have an error in it also, but it was brand new. So I
am now subtracting 25 deg from my CHT gauge and now I dont have to worry
about error. This was not an precise test so dont quote me on the error. I
was just wondering if anybody has tried this test or something similiar.
