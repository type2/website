Subject: Re: [T2] Part Help Needed

&gt; While driving home the other day, my gas pedal went to the floor. No
problem I think. I go the import shop and get a new cable. However, when
I go to install it today. I find what I think is a &quot;broken&quot; part. The
metal piece the cable feeds into is hanging &quot;loose&quot;. Three parts stores
and two hours later, I still don't have a replacement nor know exactly
what the name of this part is.
 
If anyone can help with both the name and a vendor, I would truly
appreciate it.

Well, that looks like a barrel bolt. But a little more info would help....

Front or rear of bus?

Year of bus? 

Engine?

Carb or FI?

Is it #14 here? http://www.ratwell_dot_com/technical/Microfiche/t206100.gif
