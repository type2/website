Subject: Re: [T2] Dual Relay Grounding Problem
To: drunkenst8_at_yahoo_dot_com, Type2_at_type2_dot_com

I thought I had the same problem, a grounding problem, when I would jiggle my 
dual relay on my 1976 Deluxe, it would shudder and shut off.  It was also the 
source of my intermittent start/no start problem.  I sanded and scratched 
below it thinking it was a bad ground.   I tried another relay, and all of my 
problems disappeared, starts all the time, doesn't die when I jiggle it.  
Might give it a try, if you have a spare dual relay.

Good luck,
Brad
1976 Deluxe Westfalia
