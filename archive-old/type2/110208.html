Subject: Re: [T2] CV Joint repacking/overhaul

Hiya,

I just repaired the CVJ's on my ' 79 about a month ago and I just put 'em 
back on. Nothing wrong so far. I'd like to hear if anyone has seen a bulletin 
from VW on these.
Maybe they were breaking a lot and thought they do more harm than good.

Don't really know!............anyone?
