Hi Chris,

    Sounds like a paint job I saw on a horse and buggy  - buggy. A few years
back, while visiting a place called &quot;old town&quot; in New Mexico, a tourist trap
where everything was as it was back in the 1800's. There was a blacksmith
shop, where they were painting the buggy with a brush. I noticed a finished
buggy in the front for sale ($7500.00, two seater, one horse power, &quot;SYOH&quot;
supply your own horse). The paint was slick as glass, had pinstripes, and
gold inlay. Anyway I started asking how they got that finish with a brush,
he said he would apply three coats of paint crossing the strokes, allow it
to dry, and rub it out using a mixture of whale oil and pumis. He said they
would end up with twenty five to thirty coats of paint, rubbed until slick,
they waxed with beeswax. The whole paint job could take up to six months.
    We just don't know how good we have it. I just love it when someone says
&quot;I wish I lived back in the good old days&quot;, ya, go out and kill supper, no
A/C, no indoor plumbing, no .................!
    Of no real bus content, other than I would hate to paint a bus that way.

&gt; Another option - I used to work for a sign shop where we used regular
&gt; automotive enamel and applied it with a foam roller on signs.
&gt;
&gt; On flat metal I could get very, very good smooth gloss.
&gt;
&gt; The trick is to not thin it. Apply it and smooth it out will increasingly
&gt; light passes. Final coats with almost no pressure on the paint (once it
had
&gt; begun to harden - maybe 10 minutes?).
&gt;
&gt; Always wondered if I could do a car or bus this way.
&gt;
&gt; Not bad for a paint job without a spray gun.
