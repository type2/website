Subject: '71 Doublecab for sale / Bartlett, NH area

Hey Volks,

        While on our trip to New Hampshire last weekend, we spotted a '71
DoubleCab alongside the road with a 'For Sale' sign on it.  I just figured
I'd pass along what was written there, since I don't have the money for one
and don't really know alot about 'em anyhow.  I didn't look it over real
well, but it appeared to be quite solid.  A lot of little surface rust
bubbles on the nose and all around, but I didn't notice any big holes or
anything.  Here's what was on the sign:

                1971 Volkswagen DoubleCab Pickup
                Strong running engine
                New tires
                $3200, as-is or $2600 without engine
                
                Call (603)383-0893

        I don't know if this is a reasonable price or not, but that's what I
saw, so if you have any other questions, please refer to the number above.

                                                                --Eric
