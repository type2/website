Hi Neil,
I have exactly the same symptoms on exactly the same van. I also have a 2L 76 van. Shes called Flossy and shes sick. I live in the UK and have taken her to a dedicated VW bus emporium near where I live. The chap there seems to think that it may be a cracked head or a valve. 

He runs a splitty himself and believes that my van sounds much like his van did when it &quot;mushroomed&quot; a valve. By that he meant that split around the edge fried mushroom sort of shape.

I am dropping my van to him tomorrow for an engine out, head off investigation. and when I get some feedback I will let you know what he found.

Jamie
