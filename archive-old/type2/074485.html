Subject: Re: [T2] Pumping gas 101

&gt; happened to me this morning while I was trying to fill up my '78. It had

&gt; of my standard gas pumping zen-like trance and noticed a small puddle of =
gas

the gas tank on the 78 is above the rear axle, so it is in front of the
gas fill,  just inside the opening the pipe takes a hard right and down at
about a 30-45 degree angle. at this turn is a rubber fitting, stuffing the
nozzle in there the wrong way can tear that rubber.=20

so take your finger and put it into the gas tank fill and feel around in
there, use a flash light (but not a match!) to look.  I would suspect you
have a leak there.  now until you can fix it make sure you get the nozzle
in past the tear and you should be able to fill up alright.

that rubber part is very hard to find (I think Bus Depot has found a
few) I got one from someone in Australia of all things, shipping was more
than the fitting.

now unfortunately changing this part is one of the hardest jobs I have
ever done on my 78, it is in an absolutely awkward place with very little
manuvering room.  wait until your engine is out for something else to make
it a little easier.

on the other side of the bus is the vent line for the gas tank and it can
leak too, check the archives for instructions on how to fix this, it is
fairly easy

good luck

&gt; developing below my gas tank. At first, it wasn't dripping out of the
&gt; opening of the tank, but rather somewhere underneath=8Bbut not from the g=
as
&gt; tank. Stupidly I suppose, I tried pumping some more and this time the gas
&gt; started pouring out of the gas tank opening by the nozzle. So basically i=
t
&gt; seemed to act as if my tank was full, but it was nowhere near full=8Bjust=
 over
&gt; a quarter of a tank actually. This is only the third time I've tried fill=
ing
&gt; her up (new owner here), but this didn't happen the first two times. As f=
ar
&gt; as a leak in the gas tank=8Bthere is none. I drove off and the fuel gauge
&gt; remained steady. I then parked it and returned an hour later to no pools =
of
&gt; gas on the ground. It seems to me I just somehow  pumped the gas wrong, b=
ut
&gt; I'll be damned if I can figure out how. Is this a somewhat common Bus
&gt; occurrence? I can tie my own shoes, I swear.
