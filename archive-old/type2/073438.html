Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Eng. temp opinion requested.

&gt;&gt;oil pressure above 37psi, the stock oil cooler is by-passed, and that VW
&gt;&gt;itself says that at the high end of operating temps, acceptable oil pressure
&gt;&gt;at rpms above 2000 is only 12.5psi.

I hope you mean &quot;below 2000 rpm&quot;.

Hardly.  The stock OIL cooling system on a type 4 is marginal at best.  The
5% grade, 100 degree air temp scenario you mention with heavy throttle for
longer than a few minutes will cause oil temps to skyrocket to unsafe
levels even in a meticulously maintaned Stock engine.  Been there, done
that.  Have to be extra stingy with the throttle under those conditions to
protect the motor, or become another statistic, broken down on the side of
the road.

These are not Porsches or Mercedes, folks, they are VWs.  By design they
were built cheap with lots of corners cut.  Some cannot accept this, but
it's the truth!  Is the heating system overengineered?  How about
insulation?  Lots of that?  Crash protection?  Stock seats comfy?  How
about those ultra-reliable stock dual Solex carbs?  The cardboard glove
box?  The starter/ignition wiring?  Heck, how about the lack of horsepower?
Is it really safe to pull that 5% highway grade in 2nd gear at 25mph?
Would an overengineered vehicle have these weaknesses?

Don't get me wrong, I love my bus... but don't try and tell me that it is
the ultimate engineering marvel because it is WAY short of that.  Or maybe
I'm just missing your point.
