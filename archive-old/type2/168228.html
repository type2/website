&gt; I'm sure Georgle Lyle will step in here- but since the air dropping from
&gt; our
&gt; vertical back wall also rolls against the ground, this will create DRAG!
&gt;
&gt; in response to what anymouse wrote:
&gt;
&gt; So, our buses are being PUSHED from the back by this airflow?? And the
&gt; faster I go, the more I am being PUSHED?!?!?
&gt;
&gt; Then Anymouse pops back with:
&gt;
&gt; Is this DRAG sufficient to counter the PUSH effect??  Or is it PUSHING
&gt; above
&gt; the bumper line and DRAGING below the bumper line.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; There is a quirk with US rail road trains, in that one part of the train
&gt; is
&gt; always going backwards, while the majority of the train is going forward.
&gt; Is this what we are seeing here with the VW?!?!?
