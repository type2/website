&gt; That is '71-'79 at least and I think '68-'70 as well BTW though
&gt; I won't swear on it.  Seems like the last '70 tank I pulled to put
&gt; in the pickup out of a passenger bus had the lower screws.

Yes, 70 as well. I learned this lesson at the junkyard just last weekend
after tackling that piece with a prybar (I thought the mass quantities
of black gasket sealant someone had put on was what was thwarting me).
