Subject: Re: [T2] Trailer Wiring

Frank, I pull a Scamp (small travel trailer, weighs about 1200 lbs) and had
to wire for it last summer.  On my '76 westy, there are two bulbs, one for
turn signals and the other for brakes and running lights.  I purchased 5
double spade connectors from the auto parts store, then took the back off my
lights, unhooked the wire I wanted to tap into, then put a double spade on
it.  I connected a wire to the second side of the spade, then replaced the
cover.  This made a nice clean hook up and didn't have to cut a thing!!

I then purchased the electronic converter to convert 4 bulbs to 2 which my
Scamp uses.

The biggest thing about wiring a trailer is to make sure you have GOOD
grounds on both the tow vehicle and the trailer.  I can't stress this
enough, without good grounds, neither your tow vehicle nor the trailer
lights will work properly.

&gt; Hello All,
&gt; I read a post in the archives regarding trailer wiring.  It talked about the
&gt; possible need for a larger flasher?  It said you will know you need one, if
&gt; yours blinks faster than before.  Well, I am blinking quickly, and last
&gt; evening, the blinking quit, followed by the red gen light coming on.  What's
&gt; up?  Is the flasher dead?  Can I get a &quot;larger&quot;one from the flaps?  What
&gt; about some magic box that converts from dual bulbs to one like on the
&gt; trailer?
&gt; I tapped into my wiring (as in cutting....ouch I hate that) is that the way
&gt; the rest of you have completed the project or is there another way?
&gt; 
&gt; Respectfully,
&gt;
