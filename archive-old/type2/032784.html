Subject: Re: weber carb help

jack,

i've uploaded the installation manual for the weber ICT 34's in Adobe
Acrobat
PDF format:
http://members.home_dot_net/victorcosby/loaf/ict34.pdf

if you need Acrobat Reader, it's a free download on Adobe's web site:
http://www.adobe_dot_com/products/acrobat/readstep.html

and please lemme know when you've downloaded the PDF, so i can remove
it.

&gt; I have a pair of Weber 34-ICT carbs for my 1800.  I am looking for
more
&gt; information on these carbs so that I can reinstall them.  (I have
&gt; recently rebuilt my engine, and the carbs have been off for over 6
&gt; months.)
