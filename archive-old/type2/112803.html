Subject: making valve cover gaskets stick to valve covers

list,
what is the best product to use when glueing the valve cover gaskets to 
valve covers.  despite taking all of the necassary precautions and 
having decent covers mine seem to leak more often than i care to admit. 
 so please enlighten me.

so what is the best glue, sealant, tooth paste, tar, chewing gum, or 
whatever it is you use that will make them stick and keep my valve 
covers from leaking oil.  and if possible be specific about the product 
used.
