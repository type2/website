Subject: Keeping track of cost and how much a bus

I just had to talk abit, its still friday.

I really only keep records by reciept and during trips to figure gas 
mileage. My bus gets around 21 MPG on trip usually over passes and the 
like.
Otherwise, repair costs to my 63 bus. Lets see...I had the front end 
rebuilt when I bought it...cost about $300. I let someone else do it, I 
was out of the country and wanted my bus ready on my return (so there is 
a signifigant outlay). Replaced the king pins, the drag link, the 
steering box, the brakes, the brake lines on the front, and the brake 
slaves. Only the second mechanic (this one a local VW bus nut) to work 
on my busses in 15 years. (Various busses). Other then that, for one 
year of driving my current bus: 3 quarts of oil every 1500 miles (I 
guess that works out to 3X10 or 30), a new clutch cable, a new 
accelerator cable, some sanding and protecting against rust with paint, 
a new brake hose, brake shoes, a interesting setup for heat last winter, 
various small electrical parts, a headlight, and grease for the front 
end. Total expense to me for a year: about $120. About what I would 
expect to pay, and have seen on most busses I have driven for the last 
15 years.
I have outlayed real money a couple of times: pertronix ignition, 
dipstick oil sensor, VDO guage, for a total of about $100. And some say 
busses will cost money. Some say they will nickel and dime you to death, 
I think I am far from death. My other vehicles a J**P and a T*Y*ta have 
both cost me much more. Cheap and reliable my bus. I suppose that every 
3 to 5 years I will have to get a battery, or tires, but factored in I 
am still doing very well. My lifetime starter and generator have been 
with me for about 10 years now, so that cost is long since gone. 
Lifetime wires on the plugs, and plugs rated for 100,000 miles (I don't 
even look at them anymore) and things are great. I am still (as is Thom 
I believe) waiting for that stainless steel muffler.
Maybe I will have to spend money in the future on a engine, but I have a 
spare and 2 sitting for rebuilding. I will have to do some front glass 
replacement on my 63 so that could cost me soon. Still I think the VW is 
cheap to keep going, and I drive it daily, my wife drives the other 
cars.

Now that said, I want to say something about the cost of a bus. A 78 for 
10K? Maybe, but not me. I sold a 69 Camper that was my daily driver. I 
put in a rebuilt 1641, with a doghouse, a oil temp guage, a nice stereo, 
replaced the tranny, new shocks, recent brakes, new exhaust, brand new 
VW symbol on front, and cleaned it up. All original otherwise with 
childs cot, the sink/fridge, slightly degrading but useable poptop, 
bench seat, perfect dash, bug screen, and all original paperwork, owners 
manual plus dealer stickers. It had the rust (NO dents), some holes in 
the sides, small holes developing behind the wheels. Not cheap to fix, I 
know, but not terminal cancer by anymeans. And not been repaired, so 
repairs could be done reasonably. How much would you be willing to pay? 
You would be the third owner! Well I sold it for $1500. I thought, and 
still think, this is in the ball park. I drove it for a year, and I did 
sell it to a friend. Perhaps $3000 might have been ok. But nothing more. 
Why? Obviously the rust needed abating. Though none in the floor of the 
bus, those side panels would need dealing with, and that would cost a 
bit, but not a whole lot. The fact is, it still is an old bus. The 
stearing gear will wear out, the ball joints will wear out, the CV joint 
will wear out, the bearings will wear out. But I was upfront. I replaced 
one axle as well, actually, but I told him, look, these things wear out, 
and you will need to deal with them when the time comes. They wont cost 
you alot, but they will require attention.
THE POINT: I wouldn't spend a whole lot on a bus right out. The bus will 
take your time and some (rust and paint excluded) money to fix. i would 
be leary of spending alot on a bus only to find your self spending time 
to replace those things that break. In my case I don't spend much money 
on my busses, because I have taken the time to fix them and I KNOW WHAT 
HAS BEEN DONE. If you are willing and able, a decent non rust bucket is 
worth your time and money to fix and replace as necessary, rather then 
pay for somebody elses time.

Wow that got long and preachy sort of. Not really my intent, but I will 
post it anyway!
