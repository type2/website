Subject: Bay Window Parts to Good Home - Quickly

I need to liquidate some parts immediately to a good home.  I would prefer
someone to take all from my home in North San Diego County since I am
selling my home.

Seats for Bay Window Bus:  Rear, Midde(2 Seater), and Front  (All good
condition)

Air Cleaners for 71 or so.

Nice Door Panels

Full Body Panel - Driver Side Mid Section (Cut from a 70 Bus)

Other misc. bay window bus articles I can't think of right now.

Please let me know.
