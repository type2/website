Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Pressure Gauge

And if you want to be really slick, take a fuel pressure hookup from a 
modern car (I took one from a ford) and put it in your fuel loop.  Then 
you can take a fuel pressure gauge and screw it right on.  MUCH easier 
than dealing with that fuel tap.

&gt; Hint:  Use a water pressure gauge from Sears at $7 vice a fuel pressure 
&gt; gauge from anywhere at $30+.
