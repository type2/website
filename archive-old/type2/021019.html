Hi Greg
I found that a 1/4&quot; x20 tap made a nice thread in the tube,, and then I screwed
in a 1/4&quot; bolt 
the cuttings fall into the exhaust port and shouldn't present a problem,, they
blow out the auspoof!
maybe add some jb weld or epoxy to make sure it stays sealed


&gt; The other question is whether driving like this will damage the engine. I've
&gt; probably done 1500 miles like this already, getting to and from EB2001.
&gt;


I don't think that any damage has been done,, you might have sensed that exhaust
gas entering the vehicle thru the heater boxes ...
