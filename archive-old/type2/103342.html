Subject: Zodi Shower

I've also been looking at the Zodi shower system and was going to buy the
entire outfit until I got their catalog.  You can buy just the water heater
part and use it on your westies stove!  They also have a heater coil that
you can throw into a campfire and use it to heat up the water.
Now where did I leave my pipe bender?
