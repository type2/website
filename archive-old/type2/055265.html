Subject: Thermostat question for 71 Westy

I do not want to use my thermostat. I can not get it to work freely and it
never closes the flaps fully and never opens them fully and is impossible to
adjust so here is my question. When I remove the thermostat should I:

A. Use a bailing wire in place of spring to hold the flaps open forever to
better direct the air over the cylinders or

B. Take out the flaps all together.

Any suggestions welcome. I live in San Diego by the way so I am not all
that worried about cold starts and warming up. Thanks in advance.....
