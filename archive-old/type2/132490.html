Subject: Vent Window Latch Replacement

Volks-

Has anyone on the list successfully replaced the latch on their front 
vent window?  I have both vent windows out of the bus (well... all of 
the glass, actually) and have replaced all of the rubber/felt on the 
driver's side vent (except the rubber that holds the glass in the 
chrome frame).  I'm about to replace the rubber on the passenger side, 
but would also like to replace the latch because the plastic knob is 
broken off.  I have the new replacement part in hand, and  the rubber 
strip that is used to hold the glass in the frame (it came with a 
complete door resto kit).  Looking for hints and suggestions as to how 
to tackle this.

Also... the chrome trim with the scrapers that goes on the main 
roll-down window arrived on my doorstep a little less than straight.  
Is it safe to bend this back into shape, or do I order another set from 
a dealer and refuse to &quot;take delivery&quot; if it is less than perfect?  
Other ideas?

And for the chrome frame on the vent windows (mainly the vertical piece 
that separates the vent from the main roll-down)... any favorite chrome 
polishes?  I have a bottle of Turtle Wax Chrome Polish, but have never 
actually used it.

TIA
