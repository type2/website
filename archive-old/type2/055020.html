Subject: Still runnin way hot!

Ok...the bus is running oil temps 260 - 280. I've verified that the oil temp 
is accurate. Pretty much loose all power at 280. I had an exhaust leak fixed 
and a complete tune up in hopes that that might be the problem. So the 
timing is good, all tin is in place, I capped the EGR and removed the 
linkage since there is no EGR filter. What next? I noticed there is no cable 
going to my thermostat (the accordian thing under right exhaust manifold). 
The pully is there, and there was a cable last time I took it to the shop, 
but now it's gone. From what I can tell this goes to some flaps that open 
the fan air to the engine. Could this be the problem? How would I access 
these flaps? Could I force them into an open position? Any info would be 
great, Muir's book barely touches it. I'm stuck in Crested Butte, CO and 
these high temps are making me quite nervous. Great place to be stuck... 
Many Thanks!
