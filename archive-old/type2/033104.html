Subject: Pertronix and 34 ICT

 Hello All!

 After searching the archive Ive decided to go with a Pertronix and dual
 Weber 34 ICT setup on my 70 Westy.  The part where Im confused is wether
 or not I need to switch to a cintrifical advace distributor or if I can 
 stay with the vacume advace dist.  Some posts stated that they had
 dual Weber 34 ICTs and that they still used the vacume advance.  I didnt
 think this was possible!
 I was going to get the Pertronix &quot;Ignitor&quot; system that includes a whole
 new distributor with the electoronic module already in place.  This system
 sells for 160 and is found in the &quot;Real Source&quot; catalog.  I thought that
 this would give me the electronic ignition benifits while solving the 
 problem of the missing vacume hook-ups wi h the Weber 34 CTs.  
 Will this set-up work together or am I barking up the wrong tree?  I 
wwould appreciate any replys seeing as this is a major chunk of change Im
 laying out.  Thanks!
