Hi, All. I hereby acknowlege my hastiness and lack of correctness. Carl has
helped me to see the light (Can't see much of anything else, obviously).

Re:     Heater Blower

Hi, Carl...

Hmmmm..... Maybe we've found a misprint. I've got a Bently manual copyrighted
1979, no following reprints. My wiring diagram for 1977-'78 models goes like
this:

Locating the relay, J14 on current path 68, the terminal #31 (lower left corner
of the relay) has a brown/white wire going straight down thru fuse T8, then
grounding via switch E16 (the dash lever). Terminal A (upper left on the relay)
has attached to it two black wires. One goes straight up to nearly the top of
the page then turns left. This wire then turns down and attaches to fuse
S12...... By Golly, you're absolutely right, Carl. Absolutely. I've looked at
that dang schematic a dozen times today and now I finally see it. I guess I'm
gettin' REAL old. I'm really feeling it now. Especially since you adressed me as
*Mr.* McKinley.    =-0

Thanks for setting me straight..

Respectfully,


Andy McKinley
