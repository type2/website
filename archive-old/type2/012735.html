&gt;Have you been using German mufflers, or the cheaper

I always use (and recommend) Leistritz mufflers.
I have been in this game to long to use anything else.
(I have been driving Type 2's for over 25 years.)

&gt;I believe this is a Bug (two-tailpipe) muffler,

&gt;no stainless bus-specific one. 

This is a bus muffler, not a bug muffler. Single
tailpipe and all that, which is why it was remarkable
to post about it. 

&gt;However, if I am wrong, and there is sufficient
&gt;interest, I could certainly import it, as I have a
&gt;container leaving Europe next month.  Feedback?

Ron, you should bring in a few of them anyway. 
Those Wet Westy people need them! I don't need one,
because I am buying a new stainless one this weekend
when I fly to the UK from SF just for the Sandown
Show.

(and yes, I know that I am a fool to fly 5500 miles to
buy a muffler and eat bad British food)
