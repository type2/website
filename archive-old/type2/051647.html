Subject: Re: [T2] Welder opinion and a shopping thought

Gentlepersons-
                       Shopping for price only leads to Home 
Depot/KMart/WalMart/etc. and
the decline of &quot;Main Street&quot; in your town...Fine if all you're interested in 
is low-end
tools or equipment or material. You're probably not shopping for tools at 
KMart, but
if you pump the local pros and then go elsewhere (Home Depot/catalog), the 
local shop
closes and the store next door feels the loss of foot traffic (deli/clothing 
store/etc).
Without the local shops, you're at Kmart for everything, until they can't 
keep the vol-
ume sales up and they're gone...Caldor, anyone? Crazy Eddie was infamous for 
pro-
moting this type of behavior...Pump the knowledgable stores for info...But 
buy from
us for a buck under their price. Tech HI FI, bye bye...
Your move...
