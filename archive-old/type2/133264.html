&gt; Here's a question for those running a 2L engine with 72-74 exhaust....

yup that's what I have on my bus

&gt; POSTLUDE:.
&gt; PITA #2 -- On closer examination, there are no problems with the
&gt; original muffler. It's rusty but still solid. The flanges show no signs
&gt; of leakage around the gaskets either. Climbing underneath the bus I am
&gt; able to determine two additional facts... First, the #2 exhaust studs
&gt; were both loose enough that I could see about 1mm of play in the heater
&gt; box. I have snugged up those bolts and fixed that. Secondly, I have
&gt; discovered that my pushrod tube seals are not doing there job, which
&gt; explains why I went through 2.5L of oil coming home from EveryBus.


I used a Stainless Steel Muffler from Bus Depot, couple years old and
still like new,  shell out the couple extra bucks and get it.
