Subject: RE: [T2] Another seatbelt question

John,
	I tried that, but I don't see anything. My floor is newer than
the bus, maybe all the holes aren't drilled??
	Could someone tell me what's wrong with drilling 2 new holes and
using bolts and lock washers to hold the belt in. Is this unsafe? Why?

Zach, you should be able to see everything by just opening up your
folding seat.
