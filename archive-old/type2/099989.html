&lt;&lt; Funny thing is the old Vw and old BMW motorcycle crowds over lap somewhat. 
 
They both have air cooled horizontally opposed motors.  Anyway, Met this guy 
who had a bike shop who was into BMWs and he was amazed how much aftermarket 
stuff you could get for old buses.   Because BMW would crack down on any one 
else doing that (sound familiar?) Wished he could for the BMWs as it'd be 
cheaper.   then again, I was amazed how much stuff you could get for old BMWs 
at the dealer, and wished I could for the bus as the pieces would be better 
quality.

Those of us with VW's (or BMW's) are lucky enough to at least have a parent 
company that's still around...Owners of real orphans - Triumphs, Healeys, Sun-
beams, etc. - are completely at the mercy of the aftermarket. There are tons
of tales of time consuming procedures to replace worn out parts with new, 
only to find the replacements in need of replacement after a few thousand
miles...Or absolutely NA...Anybody got any spares for an Armstrong-Siddeley?
