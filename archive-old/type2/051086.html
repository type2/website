&gt;Subject: [T2] TypeIV alternator cover plate questions

Dear David.

If your alternator coverplate (part number 022-119-281) is the part that I 
think it is, the large hole through which the alternator pulley projects, is 
like an ellipse, with a flattened edge. A few years ago, I was mistakenly 
supplied with the plastic seal for this later coverplate.

The earlier seal for the coverplate with a circular hole, seemed to be no 
longer available, but the part numbers are almost identical, except for one 
numeral. I have a note at home, of both seal part numbers and the hole 
dimensions, for both alternator coverplates,if either are of interest to 
you!?

Regards.
