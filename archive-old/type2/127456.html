&gt; So how can we know exactly what PSI to put in our tire or should we go

&gt; that we have. I just put Vanco's on my bus this week and the place the mounted
&gt; them put them all the way up to 65 psi. What do I need to lower them to?

If you're buying the stock size, 185R14, the pressure is in the manual, at
least for later baywindows which had this size stock.

If your tires start wearing on the outside edges, go up a couple of
pounds.  If they wear in the middle, go down a couple.  My tires seem to
wear fine at the stock pressures.
