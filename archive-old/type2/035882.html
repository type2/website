For those interested or possibly interested, I now have jpegs I can send on
request as I know better than to send them to the list. Please pmail me if
interested.

Also, the price has dropped to $2500 as I had a chance to sell the sound
system out of it. All of the good bus karma infused for the last 8 years
remains, however.

Lemme know,
