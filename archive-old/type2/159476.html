&gt; I *think* (ouch) the &quot;binding&quot; Jason's talking about is the inability
&gt; to turn the dizzy due to the vaccum  can hitting (Ratwell mentioned).

Oh... yeah.. he's totally correct... nevermind..  thought he was talking 
about something different.

&gt; If it wasn't for that, I'd leave it as is.  But, I can't turn it any
&gt; more counter clockwise and that's what it needs in order to be timed
&gt; right.  My next stupid question is, can I pull out the drive gear and
&gt; put it back in without the washer?  Only reason is that I'm afraid
&gt; I'll drop it.

Ok, first things first.  Let's check to see if your drive gear is lining 
up correctly w/ #1 at TDC per the method I described before.  It should 
look like the picture that Richard sent:

http://www.ratwell_dot_com/technical/FAQ/images/31-DrivePinion.jpg

and make sure you're turning your engine COUNTERCLOCKWISE when watching 
the intake valve otherwise you'll be off.  And remember to put the car 
in neutral... I've forgotten so many times and wonder why it's so hard 
to turn until I notice the car moving... DOH!

Now, if it looks like the picture say your thank yous and dance around 
for a little while.  Then, reinstall your distributor correctly, clean 
up your wiring, and time it normally.  If it still has problems, we'll 
go from there.

If it turns out that you need to pull out the drive gear and realign, I 
can try pulling my drive gear out tonight and see what happens.  I have 
an extra engine that I'm disassembling so I might be able to figure out 
a trick to pulling it out safely.  I wonder if drenching the shaft w/ 
oil will hold it in place.. hmmmmmm
