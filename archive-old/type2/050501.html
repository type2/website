Subject: [T2] Thermostat and cooling flaps

	So I'm putting my fan housing back on the T4 motor and decided it was time
to actually install the thermostat properly. However, from where I sit, the
flaps only budge maybe 1/2 inch or so when you pull on that spring-loaded
armature that couples the two flaps together. Questions:

How great is the expansion range on the thermostat?

Are my flaps installed incorrectly? I know this is usually a point of
contention on the list, usually due to a miscomprehension on what the
driver's-side flap does [i.e., point airflow straight down over the oil
cooler in the &quot;open&quot; position]. Seems like a cool thermostat should close
the passenger-side flap mostly, but it doesn't look like it's designed to
restrict the flow more than a little bit.

Indeed, with the flaps installed as-is right now, the passenger-side flap is
spring-loaded and points UP at about a 45-deg angle before it gets installed
into the tin.

What's the story? Are these things in wrong?

TIA,

Ian
