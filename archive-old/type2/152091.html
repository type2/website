&gt; &gt;I was reading with interest on Richards site about using acid as a rust
&gt;
&gt; I was using it to remove the rust from the battery trays. I bought some
&gt; muratic acid from Home Depot in the pool cleaning section. If you can
&gt; find a smaller container than 1 gallon I would go for that instead. They
&gt; tend to sell you 2 gallons for about $7 which is a lot of acid.

Home depot no longer sells it because of liability concerns.
got my most recent purchase from a brickyard and building supply wholesale
house

&gt; The acid is extremely dangerous so I can't stress enough the need for
&gt; clothing and breathing and eyesight protection while working with it.

THIS IS AN UNDERSTATMENT IF THERE EVER WAS ONE!!! ONE DROP CAN CAUSE
PERMANENT BLINDNESS!!!   THIS IS NASTY STUFF TAKE HEED ANY CAUTION SHOULD
BE FOLLOWED&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sorry to yell but I have seen some pretty casual usage
and having seen first hand some results of misuse the stuff scares the
heck out of my... I have face mask, goggles, NITRILE gloves with high
cuffs, and a tyvek body suit that covers my head too.

it works but it is nasty stuff, bakeing soda is not a true neutralizer,
only lot and lots and lots of water will truely make it safe. make sure a
working garden hose is at hand.

&gt; &gt;I would also appreciate any comments from
&gt; &gt;those that have done this type of rust treatement as to how it has held up
&gt; &gt;over time.
&gt;
&gt; I had to paint the battery trays afterward.
