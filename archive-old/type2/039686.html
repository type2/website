Subject: Texas A.C. and cupholders.

Hey.  First of all, will the guy from Texas who wanted the A.C. unit
please email me.  I accidentally deleted your email.

Also, without getting into a big argument about the safety and goodness
of cup holders, can some pro-cupholder people tell me where they have
mounted their cup holders?  I have four of the fold up kind that I got
from work (they were on a foos ball table, and I quickly removed them
before anyone noticed), and I haven't decided where to put them.  There
seems to be no good place in my 77.  Thanks.

Don't drink and drive slowly.
