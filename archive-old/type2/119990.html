Disassemble the handles and cylinders, clean and lubricate.

Do your locks work properly?  Check this:

Lock inside lock with door open, close door without pulling trigger, door
should unlock automatically.

Lock inside lock with door open, close door while pulling outside trigger,
door should stay locked.

If your locks do not behave like this, you need to replace a spring on the
latch mechinism itself.  See the library for details.  Do not leave this
for later!
