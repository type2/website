Subject: Re: [T2] Mountain passes in NC

I made the trip through the pass, in the company bus, with the barely
bbroken in Powerstroke engine....I was loaded only with enough parts for a
911 engine we had went to pick up......Made the trip in fourth gear, the
heads were a bit warm _at_ 405,(the hottest it has ever gotten)....That pass
does not play......

Out west I made a few trips into those mountains, but usually we dipping and
diving through the passes at 120 knots, and tree top level...Its kinda weird
to be 40 feet above the trees and the altimeter reading near 8,000 feet!!lol

&gt; &gt; Volks,
&gt; &gt; 2 weeks ago I conquered Old Fort Mountain on I-40 in NC in my 81
&gt; &gt; vanagon............looked for a t-shirt stand at the top and definitely
felt
&gt; &gt; like some sort of gold star should now be worn on my cap!  Took at at 45
MPH
&gt; &gt; in 3rd gear...........7 mile 6 % grade.............
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I thought Saluda grade was bad on I-26 ( about a 3 mile 6 % grade) but
Old
&gt; &gt; Fort puts it to shame!!!
&gt;
&gt; We've got to get you out to the Left Coast where you can climb some real
mountains!  How about US 395 between Bishop and Carson
&gt; City in the Sierras?  Start at Bishop, elevation 4100 feet.  In the next
15 miles, climb to Sherwin Summit (7000).  About 30 miles later you
&gt; get to Deadman Summit (8041).  30 more miles gets you to Conway Summit
(8138) and another 20 to Devil's Gate Summit (7519).  From
&gt; there you drop into Gardnerville at 4700 feet.  Typically, my stock 1600DP
bus (low compression Mexican engine) will maintain 30-35MPH
&gt; on the 6%+ grades on this route.  With the thin air, I doubt that it's
making much more than 30HP.  The scenery is so pretty that the slow
&gt; speeds aren't a bother.
&gt;
&gt; Another route for hill-climbers is from Badwater (280 feet _below_ sea
level) to Emigrant Pass (5318 feet) in Death Valley.  This route is
&gt; about 50 miles and the temperatures can be a tad warm.
&gt;
&gt; I still think that the worst climb I've done is the western approach to
Jerome.  That road is literally carved out of a cliff.
