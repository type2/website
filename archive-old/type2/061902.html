Subject: Removable rear apron on busses

Hi All

Just a small question 

I was wondering what year they stopped putting the removable rear
apron in bay window busses.  I have a 77 and also had a 76 a while
back and neither of these have it, what year did it stop?  

Is it possible to retro fit the section into a late model bus?? Does
it alter the strength or stiffness of the rear end of the bus much?

As I am toying with engine swap ideas at the present, the Subaru
motors will fit reasonably easily but the thought of a V6 has crossed
my mind and the removable section would make it a lot simpler to work
on.

TIA for your help

Darryn
