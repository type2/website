Well the time has come for me to sell the &quot;Mighty Quinn&quot;, my 1971 westy.
The bus is in good shape with only a little over 10, 000 miles on the 
longblock and nothing in the compartment with over 27,000 miles.  The 
interior is in god shape with most all the original stuff, even the childs 
cot, The body is in good shape as well except for the front end.  A year and 
a half ago I hit a deer and the front left side needs to be replaced.  For 
someone with the skills this would be a straightforward job, and the bus 
would make a nice daily driver.   The color is white and I am located near 
chicago.   I also have many parts that come with the bus.
Asking $2000
Please email fo more info.
