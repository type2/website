Subject: Re: [T2] Loose Steering 

Shawn,

i'm with Jason on this one. check ALL of your other front end
components before even going near that steering box.

-ball joints
-steering damper
-correct tires?
-steering linkage
-wheel bearings

my old 74 Westy also had this problem &amp; it turned out to be
bad ball joints.

good luck,

Joel Wilson
