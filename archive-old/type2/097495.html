Subject: Re: [T2] Top speed

The reliable, sustainable cruising speed for a stock '70 1600 is more like
65 MPH.  They will go faster (especially downhill!) but not for very long.
If you really need speed, you'll need to get a freeway flyer trans and a
more powerful motor, or just get a later model Bus, like maybe a Vanagon.
The '70 Westy was not really made for speed.  Enjoy!

&gt;     What should the average top speed be for a 70 Westy with a stock 1600
&gt; dp?
&gt;     Mine tops out at +/- 70mph.
&gt;     That just seems a bit slow.
&gt;     What can I do to increase top end short of a new motor?
