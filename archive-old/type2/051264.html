	Deck heights vary significantly, and even SIDE TO SIDE in the same
engine
	even when the rods are all perfectly matched length.  The one
running around
	in Dolans machine right now was 0.017&quot; off side to side, and the
prior major
	CA rebuilder (still in business) apparently didn't bother to notice
it.

Let me take a guess -- GEX?  If all of the individual components are matched
lengths then the imbalance must be caused by a botched align bore.  A friend
of mine just rebuilt a water boxer done by GEX that failed after 10,000
miles.  He was able to reuse the heads but had to come up with a new case
because GEX screwed it up.
