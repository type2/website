     On earlier busses the grabbing and shaking can be caused by not having 
     enough deflection(?) in something I believe is called a &quot;boyden tube&quot;. 
      This is the tube sleeve that the clutch cable runs in on the side of 
     the transmission.  The tube runs from the nose of the transmission 
     back to the bell housing.  
     
     If there's not enough bend in the tube the clutch gets activated when 
     the engine torque's over.  It ends up rapidly engaging and disengaging 
     your clutch as you try to pull away from a stop.  It's less of a 
     problem in higher gears where the engine torque's over less.
     
     Every VW manual I've seen shows how much deflection the tube should 
     have.  I don't recall seeing a explanation of what happens if the 
     deflection is set wrong or if the tube has rusted or worn out. 
     
     You set the deflection using washers.  It's a pretty easy job.  You 
     should also check your motor mounts.  The more the engine torque's 
     over, the more it can affect the smooth operation of the clutch.

Hiya everyone
     
        I have a 71 bus and when i am changing gears the clutch grabs or
whatever and vibrates the car. Does anyone know what is causeing this. I 
have heard it could be the flywheel a pressure plate or worn clutch. Is 
there any way to test it and know for sure.
     
Thanx
