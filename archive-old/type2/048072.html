Subject: Re: [T2] Parking Brakes Stuck!!!

&gt;You may need to check that your brake cables are
&gt;free and lubed in their housings.

speaking of...i hung new e-brake cables and found, unlike the originals,
there was not a black bootie at the front of the housing which kept
moisture out, and prolly minimized fraying over time. my hunch was to
install a couple clutch cable sleeve boots i saw in the rmmw magazine,
no.221 721 365A. has anyone tried this or something similar? with the old
rubber it was a no-win situation on both cables.
