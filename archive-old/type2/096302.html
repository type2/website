&gt; &gt; I had turned the bus off so that I could hear the customs
&gt; &gt; agent. When I went to turn it back on I turned the key and nothing!

&gt; WOW!!!  Consecutive &quot;hot start&quot; posts!!!  This has to be a record!!!  not
&gt; just two in one day, but two consecutive posts!!

&gt; 
&gt; 1) Go to www.type2_dot_com
&gt; 2) click on &quot;Library&quot;
&gt; 3) click on &quot;Electrical (Primary)&quot;
&gt; 4) page down to &quot;Starter&quot;
&gt; 5) the first article under that heading, &quot;Hot Starting Problem: Starter
&gt;    Relay Installation&quot; is what you  are looking for.

have to agree with Steve, it is a basic problem of an old vehicle with
a long wire run.  I had hot start problems in my 78 and I had a rear start
switch for emergencies (after crawing under the bus &quot;leaving the Kennedy
Center after a concert with a guest from Japan in the bus, talk about
Murphy)  in any case had the starter completely refurbished, bought new
starter, ran new wiring but with an automatic tranny I just couldn't
totally rewire the bus at this point so I put the Bosch starting relay in
and I resisted it as &quot;Failure&quot; but I have not had a single case of &quot;Not
cranking&quot; in the past 3 years since I did that...

it is cheap insurance while you work on the basic problem of 30 year old
wiring
