Subject: RE: [T2] Anybody seen this?

&gt;Has a Ford 2.3l engine installed...

&gt;I asked about the adapters used and asked for more pics of the
&gt;conversion. Seller stated he didn't have a digicam to take more
&gt;detailed pics and since he didn't do the conversion doesn't have any
&gt;info.


Poor college student with no details and &quot;needs tuneup&quot; sounds scary, Body 
looks good though for $700.
