Subject: Re: [T2] Cylinders Stuck to Cylinder Head

Hello Guys   What I do is soak with PB Blaster then lay it on a bag of sand 
and carefully use a dead blow hammer , this is a rubber mallet filled with bb 
shot . The dead blow is much better than a regular rubber mallet   later and 
have fun  Mark Dearing
