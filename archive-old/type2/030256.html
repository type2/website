&gt; &gt;Which Type 4 engine flywheel would work with the Type 1

&gt; 
&gt; Don't know, but if any of them would work I would suspect it would be the 
&gt; smallest, which is the 210mm flywheel used on the 72-74 type 4 powered US 
&gt; spec bus.

I am not 100% sure either, but believe David to be correct.  I *know* that
the late one ('76-79) does not.  I do worry that you will need a bell
housing to match the flywheel if you intend to use a non-stock flywheel
and bug starter. I know that the late bell housing is 1/2&quot; longer than the
early bell housing, and this length difference might well be enough to
prevent the teeth on the bug starter from reaching the teeth on the
flywheel even if you have the early flywheel.
