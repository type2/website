Subject: Everyone has their accidents

Well, I know that everyone has their accidents, and I've finally had mine.  Unfortunately, mine was nearly fatal, and totalled my bus.  Ya see, I'm only 17, and I'm a new driver.  I was driving along, not paying attention, and I look up,and there's a car waiting to turn.  I didn't really have time to react, so I swerved......the wrong way.....into oncoming traffic.  I slammed into a landscaping truck and ricocheted into the woods.  How I walked away from it I don't know, but anyone in the southern New Jersey area that needs parts on the passenger side, let me know.  I have 3 seats, 4 windows, and some scrap metal that may possibly be able to be salvaged.  I'll have pictures up here soon to show the final damage, and for those that are interested in the parts.  I think I'm going to eventually buy a new body without an engine and put the engine that I have right now, if it's still usable.  So if anyone either is interested in the parts, or knows of someone that is selling just a body,
 either e-mail me, or call me at (732)920-2636.  Thanks for anything anyone can provide and God bless.
