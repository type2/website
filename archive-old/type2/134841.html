Subject: Re: [T2] Parking brake indicator lens

From: &quot;scott lyons&quot; &lt;slyons_at_germansupply_dot_com&gt;
&gt; It has been repro'd by the thing shop:
&gt; http://www.thethingshop_dot_com/detail.asp?PRODUCT_ID=113919232L
&gt; The molding of this part is perfect, but the engraving/stamping is so-so -
&gt; it is not &quot;filled in&quot; where it should be.  This lens part is the same as
in
&gt; a late baywindow.

By &quot;filled in&quot; do you mean that the circle and letter should be solid white
and not just outlined?  If this is a repro it might be a product of the
manufacturing process.  It's easier to hit just the raised edge of something
with paint than to carefully fill in the entire thing by hand.

I can't remember how mine was painted.
