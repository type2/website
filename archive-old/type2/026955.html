I'm finding that my new and old senders and gauges are not indicating 
accurate readings either but as accessys_at_smart_dot_net pointed out, what really 
matters to me is that I know where &quot;normal&quot; is regardless of what the 
indicated temp is, and then monitor for variance from that point.  If the 
gauge/sender combo is at least consistant and you have identified what 212 
deg. is on the gauge, I see no reason to invest in aircraft quality 
componants.

I'm sure everyone on the list would be happy with accuracy within 5 degrees 
also.  What I've found in checking the accuracy of VDO senders is errors in 
the 20 to 50 degree range.
