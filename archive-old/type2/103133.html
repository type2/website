&gt; My bus is having problems with detonating. I'm running

&gt; that its around 875 like VW recomends. there has been
&gt; some pinging happening and when I go up hills and
&gt; punch the accelerator it begins to ping and then
&gt; changes to a full rough noise and the engine suddenly
&gt; slows. I dont know if its all cylinders firing way
&gt; before top dead or some other problem. thanks for any
&gt; help,

What is the condition of this bus engine? Is it a stock engine or one
that has been rebuild. Reason I ask is if you have a high CR then the
potential for pinging increases because of the high CR. Just food for
thought.
