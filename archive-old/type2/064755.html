Well, I have located a bus for my friend, Pete.  It's a '70
transporter, de-lux, no rust, kustom kamper interior.  It's that 
nifty '70
red color with brown interior.  Rebuilt motor,  owned by a german
guy who has driven it cross-country over the last few months.  It 
was stolen in D.C., sat on an impound lot for a few weeks.  Guy 
drove it back to knoxville tho- no probs except that the spare was 
stolen.

Our only hang-up:  He wants $2000 for it, and loafs never go for
more than $1500 in these parts, no matter what the condition!
ACK!
Oh, well...At least I'm never going to be selling mine.....
