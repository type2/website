Jeff and List...
     This was a factory option- don't see too many of them these days 
unfortunately.  Bus Boys has them listed for $159.95 a set, and I would 
venture to say they are almost worth it... Mine are completely full of all 
the junk I use on a semi-regular basis.  Only mine came on a junkyard bus, 
so they were next to nothing.    http://www.bus-boys_dot_com/bbaccess.htm#parcel
