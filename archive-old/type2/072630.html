Subject: oil pressure relief valve pistons

I've got three 1600 engines apart on the garage floor at the moment. Sad
state of affairs.

The issue du jour is  oil pressure relief valve pistons.  Specifically,
whether one piston or both pistons should have a groove near the top.  In
two of my engines, only one piston has such a groove. In the other, neither
piston has a groove.

On p29 of the engine section of Orange Bentley, one photo shows two
grooveless pistons and another shows a grooved piston.

Can anyone clarify this for me?
Jack
