Subject: Oil Bath Air Cleaner

Well Volks,

I installed an air cleaner ('69-71) on my 1600 DP in my '65 Deluxe.  
The hope was to get the advantage of pre-heated air to the carb for 
those cool and cold days.  I've had problems with idle (and icing) 
when damp and cold.  I've also been meaning to install the long 
pulled and discarded thermostat that we've discussed from time to 
time.  I hadn't the time to track down the thermostat tin and well, 
it being summer, haven't had the incentive to do the deal.  

I figured (I think) how the preheating works on the air cleaner.  
There's suppose to be a cable connected to our ever lovely 
thermostat that when cold (and collapsed) shuts the main air intake 
flap on the air cleaner.  A second weighted flap then is drawn open 
by the vacuum created through the throat of the carburator.  This 
allows air to be drawn from an alternate area- a stove pipe mounted 
in the vacinity of the push rod tubes on the passenger side of the 
engine (I think, I don't know, as I've never seen one and gathered 
this from discussions with Ron Van Ness.)  Well, know I've the 
incentive to get the thermo rigged up.  Anyone know 'xactly how the 
cable is rigged from said thermostat to said oil-bath air cleaner?  

TIA,
