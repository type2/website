&gt;I just replaced my fuel pressure regulator because my old one measured at
&gt;41lbs without vacuum. I tested the new regulator and the pressure is now at
&gt;38lbs. Still to high right?

Slightly says the manuals but I haven't spent a career testing every new unit with calibrated testing equipment to prove otherwise. You are ok. Chock is up to rounding error.

&gt;So, is there anything else, besides a bad
&gt;regulator that would cause to high fuel pressure without vacuum?

Maybe a blockage of some sort.

&gt;If I am
&gt;thinking correctly the regulator only keeps pressure within the system from
&gt;the pump to the regulator. With vacuum it is right on at 28lbs. The Bentley
&gt;says that 33-37lbs is acceptable. I suppose my pressure gauge could be off +/-
&gt;one or two pounds. Opinions, thoughts?

If you are at 28psi at idle with 19&quot; of vacuum I say you're ok. 19&quot; is about 8.5psi and that would be about 37 psi without the vacuum so it's all within reason.
