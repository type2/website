Hello all
This is my tip for ppl making there own curtains. When I got my van the
curtains were all ratty so i decided to try and make my own. I didn't care
for the way the curtains were attached to the van ( hard to slide etc...) so
what i have done is only hang them from the top, and on the bottom edge I
have sewn in small magnets. The magnets I used are from a store called Lee
Valley Hardware in Calgary Alberta Canada they are what is called rare earth
magnets. They are extremely powerful for there size the ones i used are only
about a 1/4 inch diameter and 1/8th inch thick, but will hold the curtain to
the bus with the jalousie windows open cruisin around town. The best part is
no anoying ties to mess with or loose when camping.
Hope that this idea can help someone
it has worked great for me
happy camping

there is a rail attached to the
&gt; bus (not the window) above the window with little sliding plastic

There is also a strap at the B pillar to
&gt; secure the curtain when it is not in use.  There is also a small hook
&gt; on the cabinet that grabs a plastic ring that is sewn to the curtain
&gt; when the curtain is extended.

Man you are awesome.  I saw this earlier.  Your spec's are right on,
down to the little hook on the closet.  How many little plastic
pieces?   :)
I counted because I am trying to figure how to utilize them.  My idea,
grommets in the fabric, and maybe a small &quot;s&quot; hook wrapped around the
little plastic slider..  Problem, haven't found an &quot;s&quot; hook smaller than
3/4 &quot;.  I found some cool little grommets in the craft area of Wal
Mart.  I did see some little clips in the fishing tackle area, I
considered them.  Any more ideas?
Thanx again.  Its always a pleasure dealing with PROS!
