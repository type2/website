&gt; I am not sure what he is getting from Napa, but these work very well.

Oh, crap! I had those! I only crimped them, never soldered 'em. I wondered
what that little blob of metal was for...

Well, I finished rewiring a couple hours ago. I used cheapie connectors and
ripped the plastic off, crimped 'em, then soldered 'em. Then I wrapped them
in silicone tape (the kind that when you stretch and wrap it, it becomes a
solid blob of silicone) .

I mounted a 4 circuit fuse block on the left just inside the door for easy
access. I thought about doing it at the top of the firewall, but didn't want
to have to empty the cargo area if I needed to change a fuse when on a trip.
The relay is right next to it, though not mounted (cordless drill battery
died). I'll mount it tomorrow.

Another thing I accomplished today was finding the wire for the oil pressure
switch and discovering my old switch was bad. The wire (blue with light
green dots if anybody cares) was cut off inside the harness sheathing. Took
forever to find. I tested the wire by grounding it with the ignition on.
Light! Yay! I extended it with a length of wire to reach the switch and
couldn't get a light. Sigh. Luckily I had planned for this and bought a
switch ($1.50 on eBay with $1.00 shipping - heh) and went to swap it out....
Except I didn't have a socket big enough! It's nearly an inch across, and
the biggest socket I had was a 22mm. Quick trip to schlepp boys and I picked
up a 24mm deep socket for $4.49. Perfect. Swapped the switches and I have
oil light! Yay!
