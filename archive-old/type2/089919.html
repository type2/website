Subject: Re: [T2] Now I've Heard It All!

I was discussing this at work with some others .  We all remembered the 
waterbeds of that era but were all pretty sure that they were rather 
thin and based on a foam backer.  The beds we were thinking of would 
have been about 6 inches deep.  They also were in twin bed size.  (how 
wide is a twin bed?)  We had seen them in vans of that era but not in 
the small engined vw buses.  I remember a bean bag type of bed being 
popular in upper minnesota  in the late  60's.

&gt;&gt; Possible but dubious. =^ ) Assuming a 54&quot; x 75&quot; waterbed (a standard 
&gt;&gt; double-size mattress, quite small for two people if they are pitching 
&gt;&gt; about together but let's go with it) twelve inches deep, that's 48,600 
&gt;&gt; cubic inches of water. At .036 pounds per cubic inch, that's right at 
&gt;&gt; 1750 pounds. Let's add 300 lbs for two fairly light occupants.
&gt;
&gt; Nah, let's assume 48&quot; wide (like my current mattress) and 8&quot; deep.  
&gt; That's only 1,037 lbs, much more manageable.  :)
