Subject: Re: 1980 Vanagon air cooled :Dying engine

Hi Everybody:

My van's engine has reached the end of the road.  In July, I lost the rear 
axle and got hooked up with a mechanic in San Francisco through this board, 
who fixed the job with used parts for 250.  I asked him if he would work on 
the engine to eliminate the oil leaks that had progressively gotten worse 
since I bought it in 2004.  His analysis of the situation was that the 
engine was done and I should get rid of the air-cooled and get a water 
cooled if I wanted to still have a Vanagon. He said the engine had gotten 
too hot from overworking it and not taking care of it (I was very poor in 
San Diego and coult not tend to things).  When he gave the engine gas, it 
was making a real load noise which he said was from air leaking from the 
exhaust into the engine and that it was burning oil. I said I did not intend 
to get rid of the van and wanted to fix it.  His estimate on  the 
installation of a rebiult engine was $4,000.  He said to just drive my van 
until it wouldn't go anymore,  which is where I am at now.  I  had just 
changed the oil and adding some fuel injector cleaner but did not have a 
full tank of gas.  The van is backfiring and is very loud like there is no 
muffler at all.  And it puts at a lot of smoke.(which it has been doing for 
a while especially went I first start running it or when it has to do any 
upgrade which it can barely do. ) It has absolutely no power at all.  It 
barely moves only in first gear and jerks a lot.  I guess I will not know if 
it has failed seals and gaskets or a cracked head until I take it apart.

This is my situation. I would like to rebuild this engine myself with the a 
professional doing the cylinder work.  The van is presently is an 
unrestricted street parking spot in Sausalito, CA. I have
AAA basic which will tow it within five miles without charge.  I would like 
to locate a vacant work space for a month, preferably in Sausalito, Marin 
City, or Mill Valley,and rent the heavy equipment I need to remove and mount 
the engine.  My auto repair skills are at a minimum but I have a technical 
education to help me learn.  I have wanted to break down and rebuild a 
engine for a some time. The time is right. my job is done oct 31 and I have 
the cash to get me through.  I noticed someone had done a rebuild in August 
on T2, so hopefully with some internet guidance I can get it done.

First, Is there anyone out there in the Marin County area that would know of 
a place I could use for a month.  Also where could I come by engine removal 
and mounting equipment.  I am going to make a checklist of all the supplies 
and parts I need.  Does anyone know of a good resource that walks you 
through a rebuild project for the novice.  I do read the Bentley , but it 
assumes the user is a trained mechanic. I also have the VW idiot's guide. 
The bottom line is I want to do this to learn and finally understand how it 
all works.
Let me know your thoughts and advice.
Cheers,
Janyce
