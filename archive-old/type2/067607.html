Hi Clara-
Somehow your writing reminds me of Buslady (Gina Godat, lives 10 minutes
from Disneyland' drove 71 bus which died, uses a vanagon now)-ever hear of
her?  I hate electricity too, but you gotta put it in context of a complete
circuit- wire from battery goes to functioning unit, returns to battery via
ground (brown wires in a VW).  In between is all that sh*t representing
contact terminals, points, fuses, switches, and the function unit itself-
motor, solenoid, filament, relay, which sometimes itself goes thru another unit.
  What I hate is the time ferreting out what's really wrong-  So you have 2
choices- trace the juice from battery, or bypass it all to the functional
device- something I used to do a lot on my 62 Ghia- you wound't believe the
wierd switches I had representing l, R blinkers, ignition, high beams,
starter- I remember once I had a switch in wall under rear seat to kick the
starter...Beats the wire I ran once from solenoid and twisted free end
around some harness by battery- just touch the battery and instant
starting! .Bypassing temporarily (run wire straight from battery to device)
is useful to eliminate variables- like I usually pull the bulb, make sure
it actually lights. Poor grounds are the bane of bulbs; make sure you fine
sand off all crud in the way of a good contact- a Dremel rotary tool is
great for this (Sears Craftsman Rotary Tool)- trace that ground to really
good spot on the body!  Your bulb working when you switch it to front
suggest poor ground in rear... The push contacts give less trouble, but I'd
clean them too; use thin piece of sandpaper to clean and squish the female
end a little with pliers so it fits tighter on the flat terminal.  No go?
Check for juice actually feeding to the *&amp;&amp;^%_at_# device by using a test lamp
or volt meter- the $15 digital ones from radio shack are so simple, get the
voltmeter...put an alligator clip on at least the ground (-) side.   No
juice? Suspect switch or fuse or any contacts going back to battery (+),
like relay. Wiring diagrams help in tracing (+) if it goes thru other
devices (like other side first for bulbs).   If a bunch of stuff doesn't
work like interior lights, something's usually messing with the (+) on its
way to the switches, trace those red wires, or do what I do, run a good (+)
thru a fuse and bypass it all to your light.  Think of those electrons
whizzing along and encountering gaps on their way to the battery again- you
want controllable gaps like switches, fuses, relays, and clean metal-metal
contacts!    MB
