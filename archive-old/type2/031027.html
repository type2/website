&gt; Hi all, just a line to say that our son Cameron was born today
&gt; the 24th of June _at_ 11:04am weighing 7.5lbs, After 30 hours
&gt; of labour. Unfortunatly he was not breathing for himself, so
&gt; has been put in intensive care, but we hope he will be OK in
&gt; a week or so. Denise lost a lot of blood (2 pints) &amp; is in a
&gt; poor way, but recovering.

congratulations DAD, our prayers are with Cameron and Denise
