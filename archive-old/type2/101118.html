Subject: Re: [T2] REAR AXLE 

Darren,

If you sheared all of the bolts on the cv joint off, it depends on 
how much of the bolts are still showing in the axle stub.

A *real* pair of vice grips might do it, otherwise you are in for some
serious work.

Probably would be better to tow it home and remove the axle stub and work 
on it in the open....wonder if anything is bent?


Cheers ,dave

&gt; Howdy Y'all,

&gt; Me 72 van
&gt; This morning i was driving to work and i ran over a high curb
&gt; breaking all the bolts off where the axle meets the rear left tire.
&gt; the freakin bolts are all stuck in the part by the wheel.
&gt; anyone know if you can remove this part that attaches to the wheel
&gt; or any tricks getting the bolts out?
&gt; Your help is much appreciated.
