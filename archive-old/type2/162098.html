Subject: Re: [T2] Type 4 engine to Type 1 engine conversion

Hi Todd,

I have never seen a kit for this but I know there is a company  
remaking the engine tin in fibreglass.

You would still need a converted engine bearer bar  and possibly a  
68-79 oil pump cover plate to bolt the bearer bar up to it.

&gt; to do this swap and I have seen the kits before.




Happy Trails,
