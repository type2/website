Subject: 1977 Van with Seized Engine

I'm thinking of buying a 1977 van with a seized
engine.  I got this message from the current owner. 
What's the chances that I can rebuild the engine
myself without having to buy a complete engine and eat
the cost of the core?  How easy are these vans to work
on.  My only experience is with an 1983 waterboxer,
and this is causing me grief.

&quot;As for the engine, here's the deal:  I don't know for
sure if it's the rod, because it happened while I was
driving, and my mechanic basically told me that one of
the cylinders either has something loose or broken in
it, or that one of the rods is messed up, because the
engine just 'locked up'.  But this diagnosis was based
upon an exterior test, we did not take the engine
apart.  That's the tricky part, it could be a minor
thing, or it might need a rebuilt engine in there. &quot;
