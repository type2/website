&gt;Has anyone here ever AutoCrossed their Volkswagen Transporter or
&gt;Westfalia? Just curious.

I see very little potential fun to be had and lots of risk 
(rolling a high-profile vehicle comes to mind).

&gt;I autocrossed a 1983 Volvo 240 TurboWagon back in the day... 
needless to
&gt;say I had one of the slowest times there.

... and now you want to be even slower?  I think you would have 
more fun in one of your Fieros.

And besides, why autocross when you can attend HPDE/Open 
Track/Road Race events?  At an autocross, you get track-walks, 
lots of time spectating, and oh yeah, a few minutes of track time 
per day.  At a typical open track event you get closer to two 
hours of track time per day, plus the thrills are an order of 
magnitude higher IMO.
