Subject: [T2] Shock mounting stud broke   '68

:-/

While trying to replace the front shocks, we broke the lower shock mounting
stud. We lost the last inch which holds the nut. There is just enough stud
to put the shock on, but not enough to put a nut on.

The Bentley mentions drilling out a broken stud (not really necessary in
this case I don't think) and replacing it by pressing in an oversized stud
and drilling a hole and replacing the tiny pin that holds the stud. Has
anyone done this? Are these studs even available anymore? Is it just easier
to just replace the lower torsion arm? Do they sell them individually?

As a temporary fix we're drilling into the broken stud and will be putting a
step stud into it so we'll be able to put the shock on.

Any help would be great,
Jen
