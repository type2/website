I did this by accident the last time I replaced the rear wheel cylinders.

Broke the line loose from the back of the cylinder and noted that it was
dripping merrily.  Installed the new cylinder and opened the bleeder and
noted that the dripping continued.  Figuring that if fluid was moving out
of the line it was unlikely that air was moving the other way, so I just
refilled the reservoir with fresh fluid and enjoyed a beer while it
dripped through the system.  Tightened up the bleeder and sure enough the
pedal was high and firm.

It helps if the front of the bus is higher then the rear!
