Subject: EB2002 Trip Report (Long)

Hi Volks,

I'm back, the Camper is unloaded and all the Canadians have returned to
their daily grind. I'll keep this version short (HA!) and post the full
edition with the pictures to the web later this weekend.


TUESDAY:
We left Toronto with my 73/74/79 Westfakia and my parents 81 Vanagon Westy
at 8:20 PM.  I'm towing a custom box trailer that has half a westy top on
it, and a pair of bus tail-lights. It holds a lot of gear that would have
cluttered up the westy beyond recognition. We met up with Dave Ireland and
his Dad Ed in Burlington in Dave's 73 automatic westy and we headed off to
Niagara Falls. My bus was hesitating on the highway near Stony Creek, so we
got off the highway and bought fuel and I made a note to swap fuel filter
soon. Weather was in the high 80's, clear and dry. We met Collison (Collie)
Corner in Niagara at 11PM and the 4 buses stayed overnight at the kingwsway
motel for only $10/room more than a campsite.
 
WEDNESDAY:
Got up at 7AM, had some juice and a muffin and hit the road. Stopped at Tim
Horton's for a Coffee and then headed over to John's Bug Shop to drop some
parts and to pick up new ones. I bought the fuel filter I needed, Dave
Ireland bought a new coil. Then off to the border and into the US.

The border was a bit tighter than last year, but not near as bad as it was
in September and October. The big surprise was when they X-rayed all 4
buses! They lined them up nose-to-tail and drove past with a very large
truck with a boom arm and sensor. They said we had to get out to avoid being
fried, so we did. We weren't allowed to take any pictures of the truck
scanning us, either. Collie spent 15 minutes talking to an Immigration
official and after that we were free to leave.

We headed to Avon NY to pick up Collie's buddy Renard and have lunch. Back
on the road by 1:30 PM and we're rolling smooth over flat land under clear
blue skies. Life is good. By 2:30 we're onto I390 and the land is looking
very lumpy. On the third or fourth long hill the bus starts bucking and
losing power, but after easing off the gas a bit it recovers and my heart
leaves my throat. Two minutes later the glitch recurrs, but this time it
doesn't go away, and I pull the limping bus off to the side of the road. The
engine is running rough, but seems to smooth out and revs well enough. Then
all of a sudden it stutters and dies, and it doesn't re-start.

We gap the points, replace the coil, still no go. Check for gas at carbs:
nothing. Check the fuel filter: OMG what a mess!! Replace the fuel filter,
still no go. Check the flow at the fuel pump: AHA. No flow at the fuel pump.
Took the cover off the pump and put it back on; and now it pumps just fine.
Re-assemble things and the bus is running!

Back on the road for two minutes and sudenly there's a nasty but familiar
noise from the engine again... it's blown the plug out of the smog pump port
on #3 cylinder again. 3rd time this year. Pull over, put it back in and
we're on the road in 90 seconds. But now Dad's Vanagon won't start: it
cranks fine but won't catch. Collie suggests it might be a vaccuum line
blown off its fitting so we unload the van and have a look. All the vaccuum
lines are fine. Next we look at spark, no problems there either. So we pull
the cold start valve and look at fuel flow: There is none. Sigh. Another
filter full of sediments, plus the pump is completely shot. My son Matthew
and I pile into Collie's van with Renard to act as interpreter (he speaks
fluent New York, we only speak Canadian, eh) and we head down the highway to
the next town. Three auto-parts stores later we have the replacement pump in
hand, it's actually for a Ford but it meets the specs for the Vanagon and
saves us $US80 and a 2-day wait. I install it at roadside, the Vanagon
engine roars to life and everyone cheers. Reload the Vanagon and get back on
the road about 3.5 hrs behind schedule. There's no way we're making Round
Hill VA tonight, so we elect to head for Montgomery PA instead, and camp
where they know us.

The rest of the way to Montgomery my bus ran very poorly on the hills. We
had earlier adjusted the dwell on the points, but we didn't check the timing
and now it's pinging like a popcorn machine on every hill. We put the
trailer behind the Vanagon instead and limp on to Montgomery, and camp at
&quot;Riverside Campground&quot; where we are remembered from our stop there last
year.



THURSDAY:
In the morning I checked the valves and then Dave Ireland set the timing.
Much better now, but there is a stumble off idle I figured for a vaccuum
leak. Double-pedalling at a stoplight keeps me moving smoothly and we leave
the campsite by 11 and make Round hill easily by 5. The bus is getting 22
MPG and the bus is running much better than the night before.

At Round Hill VA we pull into Jeff Stewart's place and he has the Canadian
Flag hanging at the gate to welcome us. Jeff's bus looks awesome in it's new
paint and when he raises the roof the fresh canvas is incredible. We crack
open a few cold frosty beverages and relax while we wait to see how long it
is until Jamie Rivers and Phil Gowdy get there. They arrive at 7PM, and
Jamie Auch pulls in with his 81 Vanagon a little while later. My daughter
Frances is upset when she finds out Jamie's daughter Casey isn't with him,
but Jamie assures her that Casey and her mom are also on their way. That
night we also get to meet their 2-yr-old daughter Emma, who was too little
to attend EB2001. Casey and Frances met at Everybus last year and were just
as inseparable at EB this year. Frances was very happy to hear that the
Auchs are planning to attend &quot;Buses of the Corn&quot; in Whitby Ontario this
August. We drink and chat and hit the hay early so we can be ready and
rolling at 8AM the next morning.



FRIDAY:
Next morning we get rolling with 8 buses: Jamie Auch and Jeff Stewart plus
our 6 Canadians. We roll on through to Opal for a gas stop and stop to shop
at the Walmart in 

I stall the bus in traffic at Lynchburg only to discover the wire has fallen
off the solenoid again; I bump-start it on the slight hill to the light and
we're running. I re-attach it at the next gas stop and we're clean and
green.

South of Lynchburg the wind comes up and there are pieces of things being
thrown through the air. Green leaves are drifting along the street and the
cross-winds are brutal, alternating sides and easily tossing the bus 4 feet
across a lane in half a heartbeat. This continues for about an hour,
occaisionally letting off to a heavy downpour and then catching us up in its
full fury once again. Nerve-wracking to say the least. The weather clears
soon after we cross the VA/NC border and we cruise on without ANY bug guts
left on the windshield.

We make EB02 by about 4PM and are immediately made very welcome. I backed
the westrailer into position and we set up the tarps and decorated the
Canadian Pavilion. Then we cracked a few cold ones and settled in to enjoy
the awesome ambiance of so many buses crammed in so tight together. After
dark I went for a walk down to meet some of the Full Moon Bus Club; Rob
Henley gave me a tour of his most excellent high top. It was extremely cool,
and not just because it had an air conditioner.

SATURDAY:
I awoke Saturday AM and ventured over to the picnic shelter to see what the
Full Moon Bus Club was up to: Breakfast Burritos. They got started about 7AM
and it was amazing to watch -- the best choreographed and most organized
pandemonium I have ever witnessed. They pulled it off beautifully and fed a
couple hundred people a most delicious and nutritious breakfast... Following
that act was going to be very difficult.

After breakfast I set out to collect a few more autographs for my TEAM
CANADA shirt, and I collected a pair of front seats from Steve Dolan in
exchange for a pile of Irish Brewskis. Then I decided it was time to promote
some Canadian events so I set off with a pile of flyers for BusFusion and
&quot;Buses of the Corn&quot;. I handed them out in person wherever possible and left
them on windshields if not.

When I returned from the walkabout distributing flyers I was told they were
loading the buses to go tour MetWiz Kelly's shop. There was a space in
roadcow for me and a 21-window had room for my Dad. Roadcow was an awesome
ride; the power in that thing has to be felt to be believed. Inside Roadcow
I got a chance to meet its owner Britt Grannis and a couple of Kansas
Buskatiers whose names escape me. Great folks.

Kelly's shop was very educational. It is amazing to see what these guys can
do to recreate the missing elements of a decaying bus. When they're finished
with it you would swear it's factory original. Awesome. I got a chance to
see Steve Dolans 66 split bus again, except now it has floors and rocker
panels. Once it's done it will be a very sweet ride.

On the way back to EB2002 Dad and I switched rides, so I got to ride in the
21-window and he took residence in the RoadCow. Riding in a convertible bus
was another first for me, and it was a perfect day for it.

Back from the tour it wasn't long before a very tall grey-headed person
called me up for duty: Mad Uncle Dave had come to call me up on my pledge to
help judge the Chili Cook-Off. It was a very difficult job, as the entries
were very good. By the end of the first quarter my lips were numb and my
whole body was sweating; I was really starting to get the hang of this!!! As
designated &quot;Meat Chili&quot; tasters, Sean Bartnik and I found it a very close
finish, we agreed on the top two but not on which was best. We called in
another judge to arbitrate instead of playing rock-paper-scissors. My pic
won out.

After the chilis were judged the pot-luck supper was started and I grabbed
some dessert and sat back to enjoy the door prize ceremonies; the Canadian
Pavilion won the Best Campsite award and some cool gear was handed out.

With dinner out of the way, it was time to convene &quot;Type II University&quot;
courtesy of Prefessor Steve Dolan. Steve was giving lectures on Vaccuum
Pressure 101; and  Dwell and Timing 101 followed soon after. The blugrass
band was going well into the night and they had the whole crowd singing
along. I turned out the lights in our section of the Canadian Pavilion and
got to bed before Midnight knowing we had a lot to do if we were to follow
in the FMBC's footsteps with breakfast the next morning.



SUNDAY:
I arose at 6:30 and got over to have a look at the picnic shelter. It was in
decent shape after the previous nights festivities and took little work to
whip it into shape for pancake production and distribution. I wire up the
electric griddles and start mixing batter, Dad starts production on the
bacon. We cooked up over 20 pounds of bacon and then switched into some
sausage and ham that were donated later that morning. Between myselfand the
other pancake producers we must have cooked between 900 - 1200 pancakes. The
line ptered out at about 9AM just as we ran out of batter. I had earlier put
out a coffee can for donations and in all we collected $41 to go to support
type2_dot_com. It went off really well and nothing makes a cook feel better than
hearing people say how much they enjoyed eating a meal you made for them.

Then onto the hard part: Breaking camp. We started at 9:30, and by 10:30 the
bus was loaded and we were ready to head out. I could hardly believe it was
so easy to get it all reloaded... I think the trailer was a big help there.
We rolled the buses out to the park's front gate and took a bunch of
pictures, and then headed off back towards Jeff Stewart's yard in Round Hill
VA. We've gained 3 more buses in our group; Howard in the 74 westy &quot;Love
Boat&quot;, Rory in a 71 westfakia with a canoe up top and Tom Hughes in his
Vanagon Synchro.

Just around Lynchburg Howard in the Love Boat reports a grinding sound in
his bus's rear end. At 50 MPH it's severe enough you can see the license
plate shaking. We pull over and jack up the rear wheel; Jamie wiggles it
sideways and it's clear the bearings are toast. We try to get the axle nut
off but all we do is break two craftsman ratchets so we decide to limp along
and see if we can make Jeff's. This proves impossible a few miles later so
we pull over and Howard calls Jeff Burks from the AIRS list and not 10
minutes later Jeff's brother Ron arrives in his 81 Vanagon westy to help
Howard out. While we're stopped I look at my engine and discover the source
of the oil leak... the filter is loose and takes a quarter turn to snug up.
The rest of us bid Howard farewell and head north once more.

It starts getting colder in the early afternoon and by the time we hit
Charlottesville VA for our dinner break it's raining and we're reaching for
the heat control. The bus seems to be struggling a bit more on the hills and
Dad mentions seeing an occaisional puff of black smoke when I'm full on the
throttle. At the next fuel fill-up I notice my gas milage is decreasing but
there have been lots of hills so I'm not too worried about it. We pull into
Jeff's backyard just after 9PM, and stand around a portable kerosene heater
in his backyard and enjoy a few beverages before bedtime.




MONDAY
It's still cold (high 50's) when we wake up and it's thinking about raining
too. Jeff Stewart already has breakfast ready for us.  Jamie Rivers and Phil
Gowdy decide to take the short quick route home and Cory Petrie will also be
heading a different route, so our carabus is down to 5. We get as far as
Gettysburg before we need to fill up the buses and drain the passengers. My
gas milage is suffering even worse now, and Dad has been mentioning the
black smoke puffs he has seen as the bus strains on the hills. North of
Harrisburg Tom and Rory split off to Tom's place in Middleburg PA, and the
three Canadians make good time heading North past Montgomery and on to
Waynesboro by about 4. We stop for gas and my milage has dropped even
farther. After we're gassed up we get turned around in Waynesboro looking
for the right road to Hills Creek State Park but we eventually figure it out
and discover the park is well worth the 20-minute detour. Clean, quiet and
affordable; they charge just $16 for a powered site that we can put 2 buses
on. 

Soon after we set up camp we notice it's snowing. Not much, but it's still
something of a shock after the great weather we'd been treated to all the
previous week. Well, it is still April and we're in the mountains of PA.
The kids gather wood for a campfire and I hook up the electric heater for
the night.



TUESDAY:
An early rise and I get the previous nights dishes washed and put some water
on to boil. On a cold morning like this nothing hits the spot like a good
bowl of oatmeal. After that we pack up the buses and gather up the kids, but
just as we're about to get back on the road Dave's oil light comes on and it
isn't going out. There's a huge puddle where he parked for the night, and
it's gushing from the bottom of the bus. Dave shuts it down and we climb
under for a look.. 

The oil is coming from the front of the crankcase; it looks to have blown a
plug on one of the oil galleries. Dad finds the plug in the grass where Dave
had been parked, but it was badly mangled by the torque converter and
there's no way its going back in the engine. We drive into town and ask at
NAPA if they have any ideas, but the best solution we can figure is to try
to plug the hole with a bolt and some JB-Weld. This solution took three
hours to implement and worked very well... for 5 minutes. After that the
engine spit the plug and 4 quarts of fresh oil to boot. Sigh.

Next thing to try is to call in some more help. Tom Hughes reccomends a fix,
and we check again with the NAPA dealer to see if they have any other ideas
or parts to help us out with. One of the park maintenance workers stops by
and the Ranger asks him for some input; and we explore a few more options in
the Maintenance shed. At 4PM the maintenance crew is going off shift and the
guys all gather at our campsite and tow Dave's bus up to their shop so they
can get into it properly with their air tools. With deadlines approaching
and Dave in good hands we have to get rolling so we bid Dave and Ed farewell
and our carabus is down to 2.

Running up US15 to I86 and 390 the road rises over the same majestic hills
that caused us a lot of trouble on the ride down. This time we roll on past
at a decent clip without incident. I haven't driven this road in this
direction before and I am amazed at how beautiful the landscape is looking
in this direction. We take A-20 west to Buffalo and soon discover this is
not a good decision... A20 has an abundance of rolling hills and even has a
section that is off limits to large trucks because the hills are so steep.
Lots of third gear work and even a couple of times I had to drop down into
second... by the time we got onto I400 near Buffalo I was about ready for a
nice flat six-laner.

Crossing the border at Fort Erie was no sweat. We stopped at the Duty Free
and picked up some spirits, then crossed into Canada and promptly ran out of
fuel 10 minutes later. Luckily I had a small half-full can of gas in the
trailer that got us to within 100 yards of the next gas station. We fueled
up properly with Litres of Canadian gas and had some McDinner at 9PM in
Niagara Falls, pulling into our driveway tired and content at about 10:30.

Total Mileage: 1736 miles
Total Fuel Consumption:91.8 Gallons
Total Oil Consumption: 6 quarts (the leaking filter gets most of the blame
here)

Average Gas Milage: 18.4 MPG  (most recent tank was down to 14.6)


THANKS:
Lots of thanks must go out: Chris for creating EveryBus and doing such an
awesome job year after year. Jeff Stewart for hosting the Canadian
Contingent in his yard. The Full Moon Bus Club did an awesome job with the
Burrito Breakfast. All the Canadians deserve a big thanks for their support
at road-side and in helping pull off the pancake breakfast so smoothly.
Steve Dolan lent a hand in engine diagnosis, and provided comfy seats for
the ridxe home. Fred Roberts Auto Parts in Bath NY and the NAPA in Bath were
a helping hand when we were down. I also want to thank Britt Grannis for the
awesome ride in the RoadCow and Tom Hughes for his support enroute through
PA.

I can hardly wait to do it all over again.


Happy trails,
