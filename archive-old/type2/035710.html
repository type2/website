Snoopy, Volks,

There is a problem with saying &quot;all of&quot; anywhere around buses :-)  As far
as I know/have seen, the 68-72 Deluxe (poptop) Westfalia camping
conversions were based on sunroof bodies.  The 1973 was *not*.  It is a
standard body with a hole cut in it.  The cot for the 1973 is one-year as
well.  Instead of wrapping around the poptop pocket, it lies flat along
the top of the roof and is long and L shaped.  

Conversions made by other companies?  I have not seen enough to know.  I
also have no idea what beyond the pocket and hatch is required to turn a
Westy into a sunroof.  I know the cot would have to come out, and I know
there is a fairly fancy cable and crank arrangement to move the hatch back
and forth and raise it into the opening at the end of it's travel.  If you
have a sunroof parter handy, it is an interesting idea.
