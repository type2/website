Subject: Bearing going??
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hello Volks,
I was wondering, what is the noise that is made when a bearing is going
out? Right now I am hearing a sort of whirrrrrrrr while I'm driving. The
disturbing thing is that the whir has a slight undertone of grind if you
all get my menaing. Could this be the bearings up front? I just had all the
cv boots redone and this noise started just a few days after that. Also, I
found the packaging for the pertronix ignition while cleaning the other day
and I was wondering, how do I know if it is installed? I am not very
mechanically inclined so where do I go on the engine to see if that is done
or someone just left the empty box in the bus. One more thing, thanks for
bieng patient, I noticed that there is something missing as far as
cabinetry goes in my bus. I have a '71 hardtop westy, the closet next to
the Z-bed rattles on bumps something awful and I can see screw points in
the wood across the top as if something was attached to it. Perhaps another
cabinet over the bed? How can I stop all the rattling? Thanks gang.
