Subject: Air question

Well my bus is still leaking fuel out of the left carb.  I'm  trying to seal up all the loose or bad fittings to eliminate leaks.  I have an elbow (022129637) which bus depot list as a Aux Air Regulator elbow.  First, what is an Aux Air regulator?  I comes off my intake manifolds and then goes to the front somewhere.  Second, Do I need it?  Of course that depends on the first answer.  Third,  How accurate are the bus depot listings.  With this part number it shows that it goes in a 74-79. My bus is a 73.  There is no picture so I'm not a 100% sure.


1973 bus with no name
