 http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/gallery/index.mv?photo+77811.jpg
 Can someone please name this color for me so i can
 order some from my local paint supplier. Thanks!

From the 68-71 parts manual:
Aug 68 to July 70, it was called Brillant Blue. L 50 H, Cloud White roof L 581
From Aug 70, it was called Niagra Blue.  53D  Pastell White roof, L 90 D

This site contradicts the 71 and 72 factory brochures I have:
http://www.wolfsburgwest_dot_com/colors/7172bus.htm
Neptune Blue L 50K was up to July 68, although my 68 and 69 brochures show Neptune Blue. My 70 and 71
brochures shows Brillant Blue. My 72 brochure shows Niagra Blue.
