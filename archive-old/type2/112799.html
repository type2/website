Subject: bowden tube bend

I went to my vw FLAPS and picked up a new bowden tube because my
originals were gettin' kinda nasty.  I noticed that it's slightly longer
(about 3/4cm) and therefore has a bigger bend.  The cable doesn't have
any major kinks and runs in a smooth curve.  Pedal action is nice and
smooth...

Think this will be ok or am I looking at frequent cable breaks?

thanks!
