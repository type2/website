Subject: Mark's transaxle woes resolved

List,
It seems that my transaxle woes of last week have been happily resolved.
Not a transaxle issue......  It seems that the circlip that secures the
inner cv joint to the axle came free (haste makes waste.... or
breakdowns...) somehow allowing the axle's splined shaft to work free of
the cv joint.  Therefore there was no motor movement gettin' past the rear
end.  Big relief.  So instead of a eng/trans r &amp; r, I replaced the circlip
(new) and the now boogered up cv with another one and I'm back cruising the
bus!!  Thanks to all who responded with what to look for.  It was a new one
on me.
Mark
