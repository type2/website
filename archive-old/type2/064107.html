Subject: quick change

Could be the record for motor change is two minutes..not a minute and a half (is
that what I said)  Either one is quite a bit shorter than most of us spend...I
believe the record is based on a two man crew ...something I've rarely had the
luxury of enjoying....John Jensen in Annapolis
