&gt;  All new VW's in Mexico are sold this way as I understand it.  Also the guys
&gt;  in the UK who are getting Brazilian Type2's are also getting them with
&gt;  1600cc FI engines (see the Devon camper report from a couple of weeks
back).
&gt;  
&gt;  Which leads to an observation... the systems are still being produced!
I've
&gt;  already written http://www.beetlemex_dot_com/ to see if he has any idea of a FI
&gt;  system can be purchased on a &quot;turn key longblock&quot; -- like what they sell in
&gt;  the cars.
&gt;  
&gt;  At what price would a new FI system be worth the investment?  Say $1000 for
&gt;  a complete system (without heads)?  Obviously there is a pretty good
&gt;  increase in MPG, and you have to also consider that a new 34-pict3 is
around
&gt;  $150 too...
&gt;  
&gt;  One question:  As I understand it the, the later bugs had different heat
&gt;  exchangers.  Was this design change to accommodate FI system or for some
&gt;  other reason?  I know you need different mufflers for FI, is there a
&gt;  suitable one with FI accommodations that would fit on a '63-71 bus?
&gt;  

Hi folks,

With the few miles I have done so far in the new bus the mexican 1600 FI
aircooled engine seems to be good and strong - Beetles UK from whom I bought
my camper towed a Beetle at 70mph behind a bus without any problems. I caught
my self at 80mph whilst overtaking without having to push the engine hard.

A major consideration in retro-fitting one of these to a bus is heating. 
If your country / state requires you to have everything present for the year
of the engine then there is no room for heat exchangers an auxiliary heater is
a must.

the standard exhaust on these engines is as follows....J tubes leading to a
collector, lambda sensor positioned just after merge of pipes, catalytic
converter to left of center in front of rear valence, pipe to left turning
forward, exhaust box to left of engine, pipe turns right underneath gearbox,
pipe turns rearward, exhaust box to right of engine, short tailpipe ending
under the battery tray..

I am told that this will meet all USA emmisions standards.

But if your local rules will let you dispense with the catalytic converter
then a standard exhaust with the lambda sensor in the tail pipe could be used
alowing the retention of the heat exchangers.

The tinware under the engine is of a much heavier gauge of metal giving strong
protection to the pushrod tubes. 

Also there is NO thermostat - I suppose thats because the FI system will be
measuring the temps in a more sophisticated way and can comensate for a cold
engine much better then a choke and carb 


good luck
Bob

Please don't ask the list (or me) how to import a new bus to wherever you live
as 
a) they cannot be leagaly imported into the USA and
b) we dont know
