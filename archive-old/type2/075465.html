Hi Rob, Aaron, Volks;

It's  a PITA, but you CAN remove the tank with the engine in place. My
westfakia needed a tank swap last spring and I managed to get the tank out
without an engine drop.

First I had to pull the carbs; but they needed to be cleaned up anyway--it
took a full can of cleaner to get each carb back to bare metal. to squeeze
the tank out through the rear hatch I had to remove the engine support bolts
and drop the engine 3/4&quot;, but I did not have to remove the engine or touch
the tranny bolts; just drop the rear of it a little.

If I had an FI engine I would have dropped it rather than dismantle all that
stuff, but with carbs it's that little bit easier.

Drop it anyway, it'd be a good idea to have a peek under the engine tin to
make sure you haven't got a rodent or insect nest in there blocking the
airflow. Aircooled engines must have airflow over the fins or bad things
will happen.


Happy trails,

&gt; You can't fix the gas tank without removing the engine, but you will want to
&gt; do that as soon as you can. There is a lot of info in the archives on this.
&gt; I don't know if its ok to do this or not, but I would siphon out the old gas
&gt; if I were you. If there is rust (and other crud) you will need to do the
&gt; tank, but fresh gas must be better than the gas thats in there now.
&gt; 
&gt; In the meanwhile CHANGE ALL THE FUEL LINES! The rubber inside the cloth gets
&gt; brittle and the gas will come out and you don't know it until its too late.
&gt; If you have started it at all you will notice the cloth on the fuel lines is
&gt; wet..thats gas coming out and you'll have an engine fire! When you replace
&gt; the fuel lines (and you didn't do the tank yet) I would put a few fuel
&gt; filters in a row. Even 4 would be a good idea even if it looks funny.
&gt; 
&gt; I would definately change the oil too.
&gt; 
&gt; There are probably other precautions too, but I will let others voice their
&gt; opinion too. You can also have a buddy watch the engine as you turn it over
&gt; and it starts to run.
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck with the new bus!!

&gt; 
&gt;&gt; what's up list,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I just purchased my first bus ('77 bay) a few days ago and I'm really
&gt;&gt; anxious to bring her back to life. The problem is she hasn't ran in half a
&gt;&gt; decade and has been sitting as a lawn decoration ever since. I was just
&gt;&gt; curious to know if there are certain things I should do to the gas tank
&gt; and
&gt;&gt; the engine (oil change, etc.) before I crank her up...any help is
&gt;&gt; grateful...
&gt;&gt; thanks,
&gt;&gt; -Aaron
