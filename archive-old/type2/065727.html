I dont know if this makes you feel any better, but the vast majority of 
Mesothelioma and Asbestosis cases are found amoung people with 
huge exposure ofan airborne form.  In addition these diseases have 
inubation periods of 30 years or more.  The majority of cases occured 
amoung asbestos miners and ship builders who lined the hulls of ships 
by spraying it in aerosol form.  Something always happens when a 
health hazard is found to be certain.  It's called overkill and this is what 
has happpened in with asbestos.  Don't mistake me,  I believe 100% in 
eliminating health hazards. I just wish there was a way to do it rationally. 
 Theres absolutely no reason to eliminate asbestos insulation from 
within walls.  There is no risk.  The same goes for the hard durable 
asbestos floor tiles. any way sorry to go off on a tangent.
