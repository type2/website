Subject: Dwell and gap, wooden pistons
Message-ID: &lt;C51ED84B6F47D211917A0000F8BCBD110155010E_at_zcard00g_dot_ca.nortel_dot_com&gt;

Regarding the dwell vs points gap. If the distributor shaft and bearings are
worn, this can happen.
When setting the points gap, you are pushing the distributor shaft to one
side of the play or wiggle
in the shaft/bearings fit. When measuring dwell the distributor shaft is
spinning, and may be in a different
&quot;average position&quot;. If it is spinning fast enough, it may tend to spin
around its own center of rotation.
It may be bouncing from one side to the other of the bearing play. It may be
orbiting around the
inside of the larger bearing holes. It may be doing something quite complex
that is a changing 
combination of the above.

Say the bearing is .010&quot; bigger than the shaft. To get proper dwell you need
a DYNAMIC 
- running-  point gap of .030, and when running the shaft stays in the
middle of the hole,
so you set the dwell correctly. Now you stop the engine, and the points
spring which is trying to 
close the points against the shaft cam pushed the shaft .005 (half the .010&quot;
the hole is oversize) 
in the direction that closes the points. So now when you measure the points
gap it is .025&quot;,
however when the engine is running, the average points gap is still the
required .030&quot;.

This is also how you can use the dwell meter to see it the shaft/bearigs is
badly worn.
If it is nice and snug, the distributor shaft is always in the same place as
it has no choice. 
If the bearing is badly worn, then the shaft's path in the hole will depend
on the speed, 
- and rotational history;-0- . So if you vary the speed, the shaft's path
changes, changing the dwell, telling you 
there is something fishy in your distributor - likely a worn shaft. Note
that wear in the mounting plate for the points,
advance mechanism etc. can also cause this sort of thing, but shouldn't be
as dramatic, or as likely as
worn shaft.

WOODEN PISTONS? What stops them from burning? Worst case scenario - engine
stops with
exhaust valve open, and piston continues to smolder until it is just a bit
of ash in the crankcase.
NOTE: I'm not saying it didn't work! Some of the stuff my Dad did seemed a
bit strange, and unlikely to work,
but when you are 500 miles into the bush, and 1500 miles from (or 20 years
after)  the nearest replacement part, 
its amazing what will work. Of course they had a basic machine shop, and
welding equipment, so most
of his kludges at least were made of metal.
