Subject: [T2] '71-72 Brake Pads CHEAP!

A quick deal to pass on to those of you with '71-72 Buses.

I just obtained a closeout on these elusive two-year-only, genuine
original-equipment ATE brake pads, for $12.95 a set.  This is about 80% off
the dealer price, and about 40% off even my highly-discounted price (when I
can get them at all). In fact it is below the wholesale dealer cost. I got
them at a bankruptcy sale (hence the low price), and will not get them again
at this price, so if you have a '71 or '72 bus you may want to stock up on a
few sets.  Often I cannot get the genuine ATE '71-72 pads for any price,
much less this price.

Part number is D195A.  They are priced higher on the website, but we will
manually adjust the price if you specify in the comments section of the
order form that you're a listmember.  (Or order toll-free at
1-866-BUS-DEPOT)   Note:  If you have a very late '72 bus (after 8/72;
probably sold as a '73), you may want to make sure that you don't in fact
use '73-85 pads, which are different from these.
