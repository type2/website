 &gt;Speaking of things that VW had no intention of supplying in perpetuity,
 &gt;there out to be some kind of coating that you could pour into the
 &gt;s-boot between throttle and AFM, roll around, and seal the little
 &gt;hairline cracks that develop in it (despite the accordian design).
 &gt;Something like gas tank sealer, but for rubber.

When mine on the 76 Westy cracked after 25 years, Karl sent me a good used 
spare, and it saved my whole engine restoration. I tried all sorts of wraps 
and adhesives, flexible and composites. Thanks, Karl...wherever you are.

If I had to fix another one, I think I would try that elastic rubber tape 
with its own adhesive backing. And then maybe clamp it in place with a 
supportive external wire screen or mesh.

Maybe we could adapt a flexible metal tube from a non=automotive 
field.....Something from the heating/air-conditioning industry. Those 
people are in the business of moving air from one place to another, through 
ducts. This one does custom fabrication:
