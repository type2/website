&lt;so I am coming you with a request for the needed parts. I need one (or is it
&lt;two pieced really) for each side of the engine or if you know of a source
l&lt;et me know.
 
  Theses parts are available new from GENE BERG for at least $50 for the two 
pcs. of tin and two of the 2-piece gaskets. (I've only seen 1 pc. gaskets in 
the past).
There must be another source for these. Ron? Thom?
