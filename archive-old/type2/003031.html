&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My problem:  when I start the car in this cooler weather we are
having
&gt; &gt; in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Northern Virginia, the starter does not disengage, even after the
&gt; engine
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; catches and is running.  (Fuel Injection)

&gt; &gt; &gt;  mine has just started doing that ;8*{

  Usually this is caused by the starter drive sticking to the armature
shaft.
  Too much gummy stuff on the shaft. A good flush with a spray penetrent
  usually cleans it up.

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, it does stop turning over, but only after about 3-10 seconds.
&gt; This
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cannot be helping things.  Meanwhile, the engine ALWAYS catches on
the
&gt; &gt; third
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; revolution, no mater how cold/hot
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I still can't find why mine insists on having to be cranked and
cranked
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; start on colder mornings.

 Try replacing the cold start valve. It may have a plugged nozzle.

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I do have an EXCELLENT, almost LIKE NEW '77 AUTOMATIC
starter/solenoid
&gt; &gt; which
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would be willing to trade (Bob, do you remember??) for a MT setup.
&gt; Or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sell, for a less than comparable MT setup.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; you &quot;Should&quot; be able to use the automatic starter, in fact it is a
&gt; little
&gt; &gt; &gt; more powerfull.  .8 hp vs .7 for the manual

  An automatic trans starter will NOT work on a 2.0L manual engine. It will
  not reach the teeth on the ring gear. It will work on a 1.7 or 1.8 manual
  flywheel.


  P.S.
  I have changed my email address. I can still be found at aufever_at_webtv_dot_net
  and aufever_at_hotmail_dot_com but I mainly use this one now.
