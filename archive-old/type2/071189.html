Geez, you folks in the Southwest have it made!! In the Northeast, this would
be a $6,500.- $7,500. camper! All I ever saw for sale around here ( N.
Virginia) in the $1,500.00 range was rusted out, butchered crap. If I had the
time, I'd fly out to AZ. and bring this one back and resell it!    Jeff   (
Still kicking myself in the a** for not buying a '79 Deluxe I found while I
was on a business trip to Phoenix 3 yrs ago)
