&gt; In this case you should do as VW did on the late T2 deluxe micro busses and

&gt; substansial L shaped bracket into the corner between the door pillar and the

Or on a Late bay ('78 and '79), it's a not so substantial triangular piece that
extends up the door post from the seat pedestal only about 3 inches.

- I removed my bulkhead on a '75 to fit the rotating seat, and still haven't
quite got around to putting this triangular piece in. - but it SHOULD be done
(or VW wouldn't have done it, right?)
