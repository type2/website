Subject: Gas over flow question
Date: Mon, 25 Jun 2001 08:45:58 -0400
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I am new to the list and new to the ownership of a 1973 VW Bus. I have had
several bugs, but my wife and I wanted something we could camp in. My
question is with the overflow of the fuel tank. I filled it up way to far
the other day. I am used to a newer vehicle and tried to round the fill up
off to the nearest dollar, plus this gas station was sloped to the left
some. Well this resulted in gas spilling out the left side of the bus. I
opened the engine compartment and saw the gas leaking down from behind the
spare tire well, past the battery and onto the ground. I was pretty worried
about it being so close to the exhaust, but eventually it stopped and I went
on down the road. 
My real question is how does the overflow system work in the gas tank? It
does not seem logical that the gas should run out that high above the engine
and that close to the exhaust. Their must be a hose somewhere that is
missing? I did a search in the archive and all I came up is below. This
person had a problem with the gas cap causing the pressure in the tank to
build up and force gas out the overflow. I have not checked this, but what
else should I look for?
&lt;snip&gt;
Since you can't see anything up behind the spare tire well, I started to
feel for possible cracks in the vent line. Towards the front (front is
front) of the vent line there is a small 2 inch piece of fuel line that is
not shown in the Bentley's for Breadloafs. If you try hard, you can reach
it. I pulled mine out and it was all cracked up. 
&lt;/snip&gt;

If someone could explain the how overflow process and venting it would
really help me. I have a manual, but I only has one picture and one
paragraph about the whole overflow/vent system.

One other weird thing is as soon as I had this problem, it will not idle and
when I am in gear and let off the gas to slow down it will backfire a lot.
This never happened until I overfilled the gas tank. Maybe coincident. I
have only had this bus for a week and do not know a lot about it, but I had
been running great for about the last 200 miles. The fuel filter was really
dirty, so I replaced that with on from the VW trike I have. It had no effect
on performance, but from the looks of it I should probably think about
draining the tank and trying to flush it while still in the vehicle.


Thanks for any help,
Corbett
