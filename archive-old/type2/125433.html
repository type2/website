Subject: RE: [T2] Re: mech vrs. elec pumps

&gt; While both pumps will do the job. A mechanical pump
&gt; wont overheat and die if the fuel filter clogs.
&gt; Electric pumps depend on fuel flow for cooling.


This is a good point. But I have not seen this actually happen very
often. In fact I had a bus once that had a lot of rust and crud in the
gas tank and kept clogging filters when I first bought it. It had an
electric pump. The filter clogged about ten times while I was driving,
before I finally pulled the tank. In each case, the fuel starvation
stopped the bus before it overheated the pump. If I had tried to keep
driving with the clogged filter I suppose I'd have fried the pump, but
since the filter was so badly clogged that bus would barely go 5 mph, it
would have been hard to do.

Of course your mileage may vary. But then again, even if you bought TWO
electric ones and kept one as a spare just in case this ever happened,
you'd still have paid half the price of one new mechanical pump.
