Subject: Re: [T2] Vacuum leak

Barry,

Had the same sort of trouble lately.  try sealing by wrapping saran wrap
around the base tightly and see if your rpm's improve.

EGR was off of mine, I just had a flat plate and gasket and it was still a 
bear to get it sealed up.  I tested by covering the whole area with
duct tape.

There *are* some tubes inside that feed the egr and I wondered after 
looking inside the plenum at them whether they just made it seem like 
their was a leak because they way that they are shaped, they might 
sound like a whistle.

Cheers, dave

&gt; With the hose-to-the-ear, and the other ear plugged, I locate copious noise 
&gt; at the base of the intake manifold (left, front,base), just under the EGR 
&gt; valve.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there anything that should be open under there??
