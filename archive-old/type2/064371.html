Subject: Oil filters

Re: 1973 1700 cc type 2.
Is there a requirement to remove and clean the filter screen in the bottom
of the engine everytime you change the oil and filter? I have difficulty
getting a good seal when I remove the plate and I always go through a week
of leaking oil before I get it right.  I am also always worried about
overtorqueing the 9 FtLb bolt that holds it all together.  I would rather
just change the oil and normal filter every time and clean the screw once in
a while. Comments?

Additionally, does a rabbit filter really work better than the stock filter
as muir says?
