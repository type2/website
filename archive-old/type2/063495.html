Subject: yet another gas leak

Newbie unlurking 
Hi 
        I am also experiencing the smell of raw gasoline in my 74 campmobile, I suspect 
a hose connection leak within the tank compartment or filler pipe connection leak since 
their are no visible signs of gas leakage in the engine compartment. Any tricks to 
removing the tank inspection panel at the back of the engine compartment (Bentley says 
this is barley possible - what does this translate into)? Do I need to remove the gas 
heater, it's sort of in the way ? Also their is a round (dinner plate size) panel on the 
right hand side I am assuming this is an inspection opening for the filler pipe, does it 
just pry off? Any tips on this procedure would be welcome.
        On another note I have been using a common Ford filter (LF115) for about three 
years, these are about 1/3 larger than VW filter, more oil, easily obtained and 
inexpensive. These filters have no valve visible inside therefore full flow ?
