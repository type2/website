Subject: Re: [T2] brake adjusting stars


There are steel stars? I've never seen one, only the brass. To install a 
steel adjusting star in a cast iron cylinder, in a place that will 
routinely get very hot, and routinely washed with rain water, would seem 
to me to be unwise.

&gt; I ordered some stars a while back, and I wonder why
&gt; some of the new ones are brass as opposed to steel.  I
&gt; assume the brass does not corrode into the holes as

&gt; chewed up when trying to adjust them, or if they got
&gt; lodged in the holes.  Are there any new ones that are
&gt; not brass?  Most websites I look at either don't show
&gt; pictures, or you can't tell whether its brass or
&gt; steel.
