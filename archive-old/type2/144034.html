Subject: Re: [T2] 120 connection question

Good job on that extra bed.  I don't have need for one
myself but it works.  I need to get on the electrical
work.  And the upholstery!  I can see the springs on
my driver's seat.  I've already got the padding from
Wolfsburg.  That's good stuff.  I saved your pics so I
can blow them up.  Take care....KR

&gt; Re breaker; the stock wall outlet under the seatbed
&gt; has a built in 
&gt; breaker (15 amp curcuit), but it is not GFI.  The
&gt; GFI breaker is a 
&gt; separate deal you can buy that plugs into a standard
&gt; 3-prong outlet and 
&gt; should have good contact to the ground plug (which
&gt; BTW, also connects to 
&gt; the neutral white wire in breaker boxes of a house).
&gt;  I've seen rare 
&gt; campgrounds where there is no ground plug and these
&gt; should be checked 
&gt; that the NARROW side of the polarized socket is hot,
&gt; and fixtures that 
&gt; use nonpolarized plugs, if light bulbs, should have
&gt; the center contact 
&gt; of the light be the hot one (check its continuity to
&gt; which prong and 
&gt; mark it HOT side).
