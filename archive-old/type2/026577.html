&gt;Muir says to remove the oil suction pipe before cleaning the case.  
&gt;He indicates that there is a single bolt or screw holding the 
&gt;assembly on.  In bently there is a picture of a screw holding the 
&gt;large round piece to the floor of the sump.  The case in the picture 
&gt;is different from mine.  I have a 1700, and there are no fasteners 
&gt;present.  

On a type IV case, the oil suction pipe is held in place by one of the bolts
you removed before splitting the case (the one kinda in the middle
underneath the lifters).  If your case has the big oil-baffle/slosh plate in
it (found on most 914's, but few bus motors) then there should be a small
bolt under the cup of the suction pump that attaches it to the baffle.
Otherwise, just pull the pipe free of the case where it is held in place by
nothing but a rubber o-ring.
