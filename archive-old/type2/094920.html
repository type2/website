Subject: Carb rebuild question - sealant

I spent today working on the carb for Sande's new engine. It's MADE IN W. 
GERMANY and has a lot of pieces. I'll get a rebuild kit, which comes with 
what? Body gasket, vacuum diaphragm, accel pump diaphragm, needle valve, 
right? What else? When I put it back together where should I use sealant and 
where shouldn't I? What kind of sealant? Thanks!
