&gt;On the other hand, a mechanic at a VW dealer once told me  that the reason
&gt;why my boots cracked that time was that &quot;the rubber dried up because I
&gt;failed to push grease all the way in to fill the boot&quot;.
&gt;
&gt;Fast forward a decade to early this year.  I did this on new boots that I
&gt;installed a thousand miles ago but three of the four are already cracked,
&gt;a problem that many on this list have experienced.


Utter load of BS, you need only whatever is in the tube (about 3oz?) plus in
all reality any good moly EP2 grease will work fine.  I like the Valvoline
full synthetic, one large grease gun size tube or tub will do a set of 4.
About $6 at FLAPS.  The real VW stuff goes $12 the grease gun sized tube,
but I've had bus CV's running 75k miles with no observable wear using just
cheap ole moly EP $2/tube grease as one of the old time list benefactors
(why aren't you here no more Joel) used to profess.  CV wear for the bus CV
seems largely a matter of luck as to how well the harnesses of the parts
match, I've seen lobro joints dead at 45k or good at 200k, I have a pile of
about 20 right now I keep meaning to build into good joints.  As a rule
early joints ('71-'73) seem destined to fail and have smaller balls usually,
'75-'80 seem to last, early 80's to about '85 seem to die, later seem OK,
but there is no real reason to it.

Any way round cracked/leaking boots spell death, boots is another story,
that is my BS part.  The only thing that keeps boots from cracking is good
boots.  2 brands I trust, a urethane boot bearing HDI, HTI, something like
that, I've put em in service for 10+ years and they still look brand new,
like most urethane boots they are not terribly elastic cold and you must
watch tearing the small end pushing it on the axle if it isn't 70F or so,
but they last forever.  I used to buy them locally for $6, lately I've
bought them at Autozone around here for $10 the kit with clamp and grease
(though it is a paraffin style grease and I don't believe in it, regardless
of what people say, use moly) now I'm not saying Autozone would always have
this brand either, I look for the symbol.  That is the only urethane boot
I've had repeated good experience with and was put onto it by a local FWD
driveshaft rebuilder who uses them exclusively.  The other alternative is VW
GERMAN.  Usually about the same price and USUALLY last well, sometimes 20
years, but it seems that a lot more now days VW rubber boots can also fail
in a couple of years, only some of them.  I've never had a problem with the
HDI urethane.

When packing I have a grease gun dedicated to moly so I simply put in what
looks right and then a bit more, packing the CV fully from both sides first
then liberally applying in the boot and in the tranny or outboard hub.  I
typically don't quite use 1/4 of a tube in each, there is a bit left over.
My CV's and boots last forever nearly.

I have used some of the premium greases like Swepco's moly stuff in
performance cars and I've seen real life reports of improvement using such
stuff in 600hp modified racing Porsches where CV temperatures run
continuously in the hundreds of degrees but in real life in a bus the $2
tube to do 4 joints will last just fine, go with the synthetic valvoline if
you want better assurance.  Or go with the full little tube that might come
in a Lobro joint.
