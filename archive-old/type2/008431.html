Hello Volks,

After much anguish and indescision, I have decided to sell my bus in 
favor for a more reliable transport.  If I had all the time in the 
world and could keep a second vehicle, I'd keep it.

The Details:

1979 VW &quot;Station Wagon&quot; Bus.  I think it is an 8 passenger?.
It has the original orange and beige paint (one rust hole on rear 
wheel well) which looks good with only a few blemishes.  Interior 
looks good, but not perfect.  It has spent most of its 20 years in CO 
and MT.

Features:
Clarion AM/FM/Cassette
Gas Heat -- really kicks it out!
New Clutch
New Battery
New Tires
New Oil Pressure and Temp gages
Fresh Engine Rebuild (only 500 miles)
with new/rebuilt parts from Mark Stephens: Heads, Pistons &amp; Cylendars, 
Rods(both connecting and push), lifters, cam.
Good alignment/front end
Timing Light, Bently, Muir, and Tom Wilson books and a few other tools 
and parts

Needs:
New rear shocks
Eventual fix of fore-mentioned rust hole

I am in St. Paul, MN.  I am looking to get rid of it soon, so make an 
offer.  Mail me for more info.

Thanks.

Matt Judd
