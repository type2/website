I am not the seller of this bus!! You must contact mmauney_at_gridusa_dot_net. Matt
is selling this bus.

I walked away from this bus not because it is not worthy of me but because I
am not worthy of it. Matt has taken care to get the brakes and engine in
running order. The bus can be on the road today as a daily driver but it
will need bodywork attention in the near future that is not with my means to
start and complete. Someone out there could provide a good home for this
noble old bus. It could be you!

 Below you will find a general description of the bus. The description is
not necessarily complete but is intended to give an overview of what this
bus is about.

The bus in question is a 1966 hardtop deluxe. The bus is 6v electrical,
1500cc engine(H series case), bench seat with full middle and rear seats.
The '66 is currently on the road and legal in N.C. 

There is rust in all the typical places: along the lower area of the bus and
the windows. At some point in time the bus took a hit in the lower left area
of the nose. The repair work was hamfisted and to make it correct a nose-job
from the blinkers down is in order. The cabin floor behind this area is
folded and needs to be replaced at the same time . The cargo floor is
toasted in the area of the cargo floors and along the drivers side and while
that is being done the inner and outter rockers could be done.  Doglegs are
so-so and and the right side A-pilar needs some repair. There is a small
hole the lower right of the engine lid.  A quick look under the bus did not
reveal noticable rot. 

The interior of the bus was once salt and pepper but most of the panels are
now gone. The seats are there as well as the floor mat. Some of the jailbars
were in the bus but Matt has removed much of the trimwork and stored it. I
believe it is to be included with the sale of the vehilcle. The headliner is
dirty but seemed intact! The dash is uncut with clock intact! The roof also
looked good.

Matt and his wife(39 weeks pregnant with twins:)&gt; are very kind  folks how
want the bus to go to a good home were it will be loved and cared for. 

The asking price for the bus is $1100 and it is located in Cherryville,
North Carolina. You can contact Matt via e-mail at mmauney_at_gridusa_dot_net

GO GET IT!
Chris
