Subject: roof rack
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Gentlepersons-
                      A friend of mine came across (most) of a wooden roof 
rack that will
fit my type 2...Alas, some of the pieces that are missing are spindles. Now 
I've already
got a wood lathe so I could spec out the existing spindles and duplicate them 
that way,
but I know that other pantograph assemblies are available to facilitate 
replication. I'd
rather not buy one and was curious if anyone knew of a site/source for a DIY 
machine
or, if anyone has one, was it worth the price?
