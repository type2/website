Subject: [T2] Status of VW Gathering in Ocean City, Maryland

I'm happy to say I'm getting a lot of responses for the future VW 
Gathering...Keep them coming!!!  Also - those with suggestions and/or ideas 
can email me and they'll be greatly appreciated!  The Gathering will most 
likely be on the first or second weekend of June.  Thanks to everyone who's 
emailed me so far and for volunteering to help out!!!
