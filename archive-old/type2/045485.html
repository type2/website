I've not posted for a while, but I hope to see you _at_ Vanfest this month. Mr
Whipy has been extended with an awning, but this will have to be extended as
my wife has dropped the bombshell that she's pregnant AGAIN :-) Can't work
out how, must be sitting on warm seats ;-o. Would you believe she has found
out EXACTLY 2 years to the day after we found she was expecting Cameron!!

Andrew, Denise, Cameron &amp; ??????
