Subject: 1972 bus popping, and making wierd engine noises

Just looking for opinions

1972 type 4 engine with a single weber.  Started popping, and not idling a
week ago.  New exhaust.  no timing scale, tried to set valve timing 0.006 as
best as can be expected without the little plastic scale, before attempting to
adjust carb.  dwell 42 degrees, timing who knows.  when throttle is advanced
it smooths out a bit, and popping becomes less frequent.  Noticed that #1
exhaust valve adjustment was very picky it went from lots of play to very
little in less than 1/10 of adjuster screw rotation.  took out the pushrod
just to make sure it was not bent.

any ideas would be welcomed.
