Subject: Oil Temp Sender-where?

Hi,

I have ordered and an oil temp and oil pressure sender with the 
accompanying gauges. When I ordered them, the Counter Guy at the 
FLAPS recommended the following set up: adaptor with T-fitting 
replaces stock oil pressure switch, new pressure sender goes on one 
side to stock oil light and VDO pressure gauge  and temp sender on 
the other side of the T-fiting.  Is this a good place to get an oil 
temp reading? I will also be running a Gene Berg dipstick sender just 
to make things complicated :)

Thanks
