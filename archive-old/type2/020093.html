I once had my 78 going past 90 and it was cruising along no problem....but ..it
was spraying oil like a texas well so i knew it was almost rebuild time, It
actually caught fire twice that day b/c of oil on the exhaust, good thing i carry
2 fire extinguishers, it got me home though.  would i do it again, not a chance.
i keep it where the manual says 75 max cruising speed but i will bring it up to
80 to pass someone, yup i can pass no problem but i do have the 2liter. Unless
you know your engine is toast i would not recommend doing 90 plus in a bus though
on the rmmw chat room there is a gentlemen with a 73 1700 with a performance
electronic FI like the H*nd* people use, computer programmable who claims to have
gone triple digits with power to spare, he also says he has almost 200,000 on the
engine (hmm makes me think of a ripley's believe it or not episode)

&gt;   I run a 1600
&gt; single port with a single carb and no mods to the engine in my 71 bus, and I
&gt; have plenty of power   Well, take a look.
&gt; http://www.luckyboys_dot_com/isaiah/speeddemon.jpg  I
&gt; took that picture yesterday on the way home from the Halloween campout in
&gt; northern IL.  Even had a little bit of a headwind/crosswind.  My 62 with a
&gt; 1600 single port would do 75mph too...
