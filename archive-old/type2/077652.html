Subject: still need fi guru's

Fi Guru's,

78 2 liter stock

Well, replacing my fuel filter(s) didn't do the job..  :-(

Went for a test drive between flash floods on Saturday and made it about
3.5 miles(at 50mph).  Went back 6 hrs later and drove it back home.

Is it possible for any of these to be heat sensitive?

Double relay
Fuel pump
AFM
Anything electrical in the fuse area?(where heat is coming out).

I have done nothing except make the heater work(vacuumed seat padding
out of the main tube to the front) since I drove it over 25 miles at
speeds up to 75 miles/hour....and stop and go traffic.

Since it seems to take a long time idling(45 minutes or more) for the
problem to happen, I am thinking that something in the fuse box is heat
sensitive? I have tested each time with the heat &quot;on&quot; full blast.
The only thing I can think of now is to preheat some of the items with a
hair dryer and then see how long it takes to fail.  The AFM is
&quot;never&quot; hot, cause it has nice cool air running thru it.  The fuel pump
doesn't feel hot at all.  Haven't felt of the double relay when failed.


It starts and runs fine otherwise.  I will try to get it to the
&quot;fail&quot; point in the driveway again, and then check the afm and make sure
the fuel pump still has power to it.

When testing previously, and having it fail...I could just watch the fuel
pressure start dropping from 32psi to when it dies(about 25psi).  

The fuel pump seems a little noisier than before and I swear I can hear it
running now, when I couldn't before.  Has anyone ever seen a fuel pump be
sensitive to &quot;consumption&quot;.  It is like it will pump x amount of fuel and
then quit.  I really would like to replace the &quot;correct&quot; part since all
are expensive&lt;grin&gt;.


Cheers ,dave
