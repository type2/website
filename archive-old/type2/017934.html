Subject: Re: sagging rear end on bay window

my '73 came that way brand new from the dealer.  To the best of my
knowledge, that is they way they were designed.  It's frustrating
because you can't see very far back through the rear view mirror, but
that is the way the factory wanted the buses to stand.
