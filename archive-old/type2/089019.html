Subject: Friday Stuff

Greetings, all...........

As I sit at my computer and read through the day's T2 messages I am struck
by how attached I have become to this daily ritual. No matter what else is
going on in my life, I always make time for The List. Sometimes it's a quick
'zip' through the messages, but most often I read each one.

Sean, you have cranked up my envy meter! A Nova Scotia tour in my 74
Weekender is still only in the dreaming stages but I will make it a reality
someday. Glad to hear the trip was vehicularly flawless after your EB
adventure.

I have made two trips from Kentucky to Michigan in my bus in as many months
and will be doing it again next weekend; about 1200 miles round trip. I just
finished an oil change (Shell 40 weight), tweaked the dwell and timing, and
this weekend she'll get a good cleaning in preparation. BTW, when I first
checked my dwell it was a little high, around 60 degrees, but it also seemed
to float about 4-6 degrees at steady idle of 1000 RPM. I've never seen this
before, how about any of you? After I re-set it to 50 degrees it seemed to
hold steady but I'll keep an eye on it for a while. This is on an 1800 with
an SVDA dizzy from Air-cooled_dot_net.

But, I digress. Normally, before taking a major road trip I check out the
bus's systems and make necessary corrections. The last trip to Michigan was
for a funeral; obviously unplanned. Checked the oil, filled the tank and
headed off into the night. The bus performed flawlessly, getting 20mpg on
the highway and never gave the least indication of trouble. I think this is
due in part to an often overlooked aspect of operating an older, finicky
vehicle. In a word: Faith. Not just confidence but honest-to-god faith that
is an out-growth of confidence in the mechanical condition of the machine.
There are many fine folks on this list who have backrounds in the mechanical
professions and whose advice is not to be taken lightly, but hard science
can only take you so far; after that you just have to believe.

Well, this is enough rambling, even for a Friday.

Keeping the faith,
Dave
74 Riviera Weekender, &quot;Rivka&quot;
