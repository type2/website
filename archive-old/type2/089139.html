Subject: I am STILL Having Starting Probs

I thought this problem might be the tranny ground strap......but it is
connected
She will start with a jump start and run good and drive good she will even
start without cables for a minute after i shut her off but iff i try to
start her three minutes later i get nothing. What is going on with my
baby????
