Subject: cooling tin question
Message-ID: &lt;3746A8FD.127C7D65_at_mindspring_dot_com&gt;

Hey. After a year of searching I finally bought my first bus-
a 1970 hardtop camper. Another listee came to check it out
(thanks Chris!) and showed me where the heat riser tin is gone.
Also the engine compartment seal is in need of replacement.
You might guess that it is running hot. I will be ordering a seal
soon. Does anyone have spare tin for the heat risers?

I was doing the valves yesterday and noticed that I could see
the cooling fins on all of the cylinders from underneath. Is this
right? Am I missing some key cooling tin?

Also, I want to replace the metal fuel line that passes through
the firewall. I can see etch marks where it has been rubbing :^O
Is a pre-bent fuel-line available, or does one have to fabricate
it out of a generic piece? I checked bus depot and could not
find it.

thanks...

Matt Freeman
