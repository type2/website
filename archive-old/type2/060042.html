I had been driving around in primer for about a year.  I took a long board and
air sanded with 100 grit to make sure surfaces were flat as I was going to get
them.  I did some hand sanding on curved and ridged surfaces to keep from
curtting through to bare metal too much.  I took lights and handles off myself
but left the windows in.  I had them prime with urethane primer and sand.
They acid etched the bare metal before priming, then they painted with
urethane paint.  I have a two year unconditional guarantee.  Full replacement
if the paint peels, etc.  then a 3/4 guarantee for the nest two years.  They
pay 3/4 I pay 1/4.  The entire job cost $595.  I didn't want a $3000 paint
job.  Maybe someday but not right now.  They did a better job than I had
expected.  Probably because I had been working on the bus myself for awhile
but it loks good.  I live in Mobile, AL, and their shop is on Dauphin Street.
