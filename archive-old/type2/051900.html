Subject: Re: [T2] Engine removal info

Remember that to prevent damage to the transshaft/ clutch throwout, you
have to pull the engine  parallel to the shaft, requiring a rollback.  
You can drive the rear wheels onto 2 stacked 2x8&quot; boards, the lower one
about 2 ft long, the upper, about 1 foot.  Nail them together.  This
gets you 3&quot; of clearance.  Helps when you lie under there to get the
nuts off the bell housing.  You can also jack up the bottom of the shock
on each wheel and place the boards under.  I level the bus to the floor
by jacking up the front also and using jack stands.  This assures that
as you roll the engine to the trans, you aren't changing the height. 
Remove the oil filler inlet to allow rearward clearance.  Basically you
put a plywood board under the engine spanning heaterbox width and let it
down.  I've done this alone, but you need to balance the engine on the
jack.  Tip the engine using a LONG 2x4 and a cinder block fulcrum to get
the jack out.  I think I had only to remove the AFM and perhaps the
giant s  airhose.  Since you have a 72 you don't have the luxuary of
lying in the rear looking through the inside engine hatch- you have to
lie underneath and guide the engine onto the transshaft from beneath-
helps to have another person guiding! To get the engine under again and
onto the jack, Use the fulcrum and the long 2x4 again plus a pile of
boards to prop under the heaterbox.
