Subject: Bugs, Busses, and Things...

Last weekend I took a trip down to Hyannis, MA (Cape Cod) to visit a
Volkswagen repair shop that also specializes in used parts.  Bugs,
Buses, and Things is a small shop with a few bays that specializes in
just what thier name says.  Not only do they do repair work, but have
parted out tons of cars in the past, and therefore have a whole bunch of
used parts for sale.
        Bob, the guy behind the counter, was a great host and gave me the
.50
cent tour of the place, including a visit to their 3rd floor attic chock
full of doors, hoods, camper interiors, etc...  I would recommend giving
them a call if you can't find a particular part.  They gave me &quot;bulk&quot;
discounts on many of the parts I got, which included a new set of wiper
arms, blades, brake pads and shoes, and brake lines.  I also picked up a
used rear side marker bulb assembly that looked new, a new-looking pedal
assembly cover plate, and various screws that I needed.  All in all a
very worthwhile trip, and a shop that I would reccomend.
