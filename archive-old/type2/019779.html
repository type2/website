Subject: Re: [T2] relocating battery in 72 bus
References: &lt;B5F2254C.4939%ncbus_at_mindspring_dot_com&gt;

I bought a replacement tray from one of the mail order parts places (WW, I
think).  It fit pretty well, but I had to trim it in places.  I tack welded it
in as many places as I could, then caulked it with silicone.  Then I coated it
top and bottom with Eastwood Battery tray coating, and it has held up really
well.

&gt; After many years of fine service, the battery in the 1972 bus is giving up
&gt; the ghost. It is really time to relocate it to the left side of the engine
&gt; room becuase there isn't really any battery tray left. Has anyone done this?
&gt; Any suggestions for running the hot and ground strap?
