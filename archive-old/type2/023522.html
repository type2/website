&lt;&lt;  had to pay shipping both ways but I now have a much nicer set of heads.
 No cracks are immediately visible (though I haven't removed the valves yet)
 and the combustion chambers are nicely polished (I paid for
 unshrouding/polishing).  They even managed to find me another set of heads
 with the vent ports under the valve covers, which was nice of them.  The
 only things I noticed were that the chambers are marked 48cc's when I
 specified 47 (no big deal - a little lower compression won't hurt) and they
 didn't drill and tap the CHT sensor mount on the right head like I asked
 (again, no big deal I can do that myself).
 
 The heads will go on sometime in the next month, then I will get some
 bigger main jets and go back to the dyno to see how much (if any)
 horsepower I gained for my $450 MSHP investment.

hmmmm...$450  for some heads that you had to pay shipping both ways on, even 
after they had not sent a good product to begin with, AND it seems they left 
out doing some of the items that you specifically asked for ( and paid for i 
am assuming)......but oh well...i am convinced they will not get any of my 
business.  thanks for the post.
