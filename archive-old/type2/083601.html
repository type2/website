&gt; Both my Busses have alternators, but this would be handy for another car (at
&gt; least it is German) that I have.

No, the two operate on completely different principles.  You'd have to
replace all the interior parts of the generator with redesigned bits, and
I think that the diameter of the rotor is important, otherwise VW would
have made the alternator the same size as the generator.
