I am a brand new owner, and probably in over my head, but please bear 
with me.  I have tried researching this dilema and have questions.  I 
understand the servo works on a vacuum, should be connected to my 
manifold for proper operation.  (71 Westy)  In crawling under I find the 
vacuum hose plugged off.  It doesnt seem to be connected.  So how do I 
troubleshoot?  The brakes do not have any power, they seem to be 
dragging.  Bad servo?  Is the servo even connected or necessary?  Bad 
master cylinder?
