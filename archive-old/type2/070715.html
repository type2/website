I respectfully disagree. I would check the CV joints first. 72 tranny 
has slightly different gearing and rear tranny mounts that may get in 
the way.. Perhaps you could swap bellhousings but this is all 
academic until you do the CVs.

Good luck and if you have pics of the A-wagen send them my way. I 
have am developing a nasty high-roof bus fetish :)
