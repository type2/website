Subject: Need advice on California SMOG for 1977 Bus

Please help me collect information so that I can make
a decision of what to do with my newly-acquired 1977
VW Bus with emissions systems that have been heavily
modified by the previous owner.

My three choices are:
  1) sell at to a person cheaply after I fully
disclose my problems with the exhaust system
  2) buy another van for parts
  3) fix the van and try to pass smog

http://63.161.223.55/~craigoda/77-bus/

Please click on the above link for information I've
collected thus far from the VW bus community (which I
really want to be a part of because it seems so fun).

My van is a pop-top with full camper equipment, sink,
stove, refridgerator.  So, there is some value to the
interior components. Also, there is almost no rust,
but the van needs a paint job. 

Advice and opinions would be very much appreciated.

Regards,
Craig
