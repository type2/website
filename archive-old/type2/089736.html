Subject: 96mm piston upgrade

--part1_151.127b04e1.2a8cfed4_boundary

Has anyone put 96mm pistons in their 2.0l engine. We have a 77 and wanted to 
pump it up a little for a little extra towing power. Thruway driving and 
country travels. Any suggestions, also putting a higher lift cam. ggod or 
bad. thanks Dylan and Stephanie
