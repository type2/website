Subject: Re: [T2] new single vaccum advance dist. question.

I assure you our timing specs are correct. Obviously Kurt and Ann are
ignorant about proper vac advance operation (not being rude, just a fact).
if you check the timing it's 32 total at full throttle, which is what they
would &quot;recommend&quot; with a 009. The addl 10-13 degrees only comes at part
throttle, when the engine can take it, and actually NEEDS the extra advance
to get better mileage and run cooler.

if you like the engine running hotter then designed and getting worse
mileage, by all means retard the timing from our suggested settings.

Also, Ronnie is at OldVolks, it's me at Aircooled.Net. Lastly, specs for OUR
SVDA are different then any factory unit, so don't confuse our SVDA with the
ones offerred factory installed by VW (we recurve them here), they are NOT
THE SAME.
