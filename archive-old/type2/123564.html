Subject: re:[T2] breakin in &amp; heaterbox spring replacement

&gt;&gt; and after sunday had nearly passed i wonder now what to put
between the two heaterbox parts for a gasket. ideas on what the factory
white stuff/ decrepitated crusty  was?

jamey writ:
&gt;Do you mean the material that was between the heat exchanger and the cylinder
head?

when you take apart a 1600 heaterbox by unfolding the tabs there's two
sections. the factory placed some white goop turned crud between the metal.
what is it/ replacement? is the question.  - steve
