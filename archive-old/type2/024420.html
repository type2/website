Careful with that VIN, Eugene! The fine (in this case, Federal), is something 
on the order
of $25,000 or so...And I'm sure there's other violations (tax evasion?) that 
the boys at
the border would just love to slap on you. If I remember, BeetleMex reuses 
&quot;your&quot; chass-
is so the VIN stamped on it and your title still match.

P.S. You may think it's &quot;only&quot; a bus but my guess would be the boys at the 
border are
probably aware of most schemes to slip &quot;grey market&quot; cars into the country.
