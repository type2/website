I bought one of these from a truck stop ($40?)

It's great for sticking inside your bed 1 hour before you stop for the 
night. Prevents that initial gasping when you get under the covers. 

I wouldn't leave it on all night though (nless you're going to be driving 
all the next day: 15 amps is huge)
