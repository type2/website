Subject: T-Shirt Clarification

Wow, sorry about the confusion. I don't have any shirts left, I only order as
many as I have payments for. What I meant is that the cost of the screens
decreases as the number of shirts increases. It is a flat fee, so the marginal
cost decreases with volume. Simply, each color requires 1 screen, which has a
flat fee of $20.00. If I order 20 shirts, each color costs $1.00. If I order 60
shirts, the colors only cost $0.33
 As I sell the shirts at a fixed price, I must fix that price based on the
numbers I receive of people interested. So, If 30 people tell me they want a
shirt, and I base the price on that, then I only get 15 orders, the shirts
actually cost me more than the estimate. It would be unfair to charge people
more than they agreed to pay for the shirt, so I must pay that extra cost
myself.
 So, alas, I don't have any extras. I couldn't even afford to get myself one
from the last batch. However, I might be able to do another batch sometime, if
enough people swear to order one...
We'll see. I'm also trying to work something out with the stickers.
Thanks,
