&gt;One thing you may want to try... the Tom Wilson book I have recommends
&gt;this procedure for breaking in the engine (as I remember it):  Run the
&gt;bus through 5 or more of cycles of: from 20mph, accelerate to 50mph at
&gt;3/4 throttle, then decel back to 20mph.  Apparently, you don't want to do a
&gt;lot of driving at a constant velocity during the first few hundred miles
&gt;after a rebuild.  Not sure why... maybe some other listees can shed some
&gt;light on this.

When the rings are forced to one side of the groove
and then the other as illustrated above, they tend to
seat quicker. Both sides of the ring lands must seal.
