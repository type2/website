Subject: RE:  Great Bus Tour

&gt;A VintageBus list member has it and will be transporting it to
&gt;EveryBus in hopes of passing it off for it's next leg of it's
&gt;journey...

Mike Benthin's right - this thing is doing some serious backtracking!

Leo Sauderman (sp?) generously set up a sight 6 months ago to promote and
track the progress of this thing (see
http://excalibre_dot_com/bussin/great_bustour_.html ) and it went along great up
until late December some time then it just kinda stalled.  I haven't seen
Leo's name on the list for quite some time so I don't think we can count on
him to continue the work.  But there's still a lot of us interested in
getting it back on the road again.

The gist of the Tour is that there is a &quot;baton&quot; in the form of a hubcap, a
disposable camera, and a box of misc. items being passed from driver to
driver (driving anywhere from a few miles up to several hundred to meet the
next driver).  Each driver gets to sign the hubcap, take a few pics of their
meeting with the next driver, write an entry in a log book, and know that
he/she was a part of &quot;The Great Bus Tour&quot;.  Up to the point it stalled, pics
and log entries were being posted on Leo's sight so the rest of us could
follow along.

It's time to get it on the road again!!

According to the rough map that Leo had drawn out based on the folks signed
up at the time, it looks like the hubcap should be heading up into the
Atlanta, GA area next and then though Alabama, western Tennessee and
Kentucky and making a big loop though Indiana, Michigan, Illinois Missouri,
then south through Oklahoma and Texas before finding it's way across the
Rockies and to the West Coast.

Now, I know a lot of folks have moved/lost interest in buses/gained interest
in buses, etc. in the last 4-6 months, but I think Leo's proposed route has
merit and we should adapt it to our present situation.  I don't have the
time, knowledge, or resources to take over Leo's web page support, but if no
one else does either, I still think we can get this thing moving.

In the absence of an organized web page to promote the progress, I would
suggest that who ever has the baton needs to solicit (via the vintage AND
type2 lists) for a driver to meet him for a hand-off and who will then in
turn actively solicit another driver.  And remember, a large part of the
object here is to move the baton around the country, not just up and down
the East Coast!  Simply post where you are and how far from your location
you can drive.  Then any parties that can reach that same area can respond
and you can work out who/where/when.

So, how 'bout it?  Will the afore-mentioned &quot;VintageBus list member&quot; who has
it take the initiative to move this thing westward?  Let us know who you are
and what your range of driving is and surely one of us will step up to the
plate to meet you at a mutually convenient place and start this thing moving
again!!!
