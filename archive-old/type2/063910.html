Subject: Re: SOTO or NEATO?

&gt;The 59 Westy I just bought has a SOTO sticker on it.  Don't know much about
them.  I do know about NEATO, though.
&gt;
&gt;Anyone care to enlighten me, and offer a testimonial or two?

SOTO is a cash flow device for a gent named David Heard.  Send in your $20
or so, and never hear back.  At least if you sent the $20 to _me_ I'd write
you a nice thank you note...

NEATO is the Real Deal.    For more info, go to

The &quot;for sale&quot; section in the newsletter is worth it all by itself!
