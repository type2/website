Subject: Re: Amplified Audio?

&gt; I have a question about installing an amplifier into my 1970 type2.  I
have
&gt; put the amp into the bus, but it tends to cut out.  It will work for a
&gt; while, but then it shuts down.  Is my battery powerful enough to run the
&gt; amp?  I had a 60 watt amp that ran fine, but the new one is a 100 watt amp
&gt; and it cuts out.  Any suggestions will be helpful.
&gt; thanks,

You need to make sure, first of all, that there is ample ventilation around
the amp. Most of the newer amps have thermo-switches in them that will cut
off the amp if it gets too hot.  Think of it as if it were your engine (heat
= bad).  If that doesn't help (or is not the case) then all I can say is
check your connections.  Your bus should have enough juice to run the thing.
Good Luck
