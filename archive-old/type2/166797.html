 Which distributor do you have? SVAD, DVAD, 009?
 Where you set your
 timing is dependent on the distributor.
 
 Find the part number and then cross check.

Hopefully he has the stock factory electronic igintion
distributor which uses a dual vacuum unit. 5 after is
correct IF he has vacuum at the retard side AND the
vacuum unit works. 

Quick test: at idle with the timing light on and idle
speed correct and timing at 5 after, unplug the retard
hose. That is the inner hose connected to the flat
side. Timing should immediately go to 7.5 before. If
it does not: you have no vacuum or the unit leaks.
Until you fix it, run your timing at 7.5 before. With
it at 7.5 before, open the throttle to around 3500
RPM's [that is when the timing mark will stop moving.
See where the mark is now. It should be at the O in
VOR which is past the numbers on the scale. IF it does
not go past the numbers, you have either no vacuum
advance or no centrifugal advance. Both will cause low
power.
