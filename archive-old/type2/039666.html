Subject: smog

Was sweating over getting my '76 to pass smog. Replaced the cold start
valve and EGR filter. Bought a replacement EGR valve but it was for a
Rabbit. IT PASSED! HOOT!!! What a relief!!!

Only another two smog tests to go before the vehicle is exempt under
California's SB42.

I mean the vehicle passed EASILY!!! WAY under the max numbers, and BELOW
average for hydrocarbon emissions!!! I am just delighted!!!
YEEHA!!!!!!!!!!!
