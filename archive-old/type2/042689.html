Hi,

&gt; should i buy 185-70-14, or should i opt for 185-75-14's? ...

 Nope. Both are wrong. The correct size is 185R14C (a &quot;commercial vehicle&quot;
rating equivalent to a 185/80 size but with a high weight rating). A vehicle
that is run light (ie unladen) can use &quot;185R14 Reinforced&quot; tyres, the grade
between standard car tyres and load range &quot;C&quot; commercial vehicle tyres.

&gt; ... just wondering if it
&gt; matters,

 Yup, it does. Fitting the correct tyres will make a BIG difference to the
stability and safety of your bus. IMHO running a bus on car tyres is like
running a Porsche on standard tyres: they'll work, for a while at least, but
they won't work very well and they'll let you down when you _really_ don't
want them too.

&gt; or if one is more desirable than the other.... thanks in advance

 There are endless discussions, debates and comments in the archives on
tyre choice but most of the good info is summarised in the library pages
on tyres. Check out:

 Personally, I like Michelins and would recommend the model from the
Michelin
Agilis range that suits your budget and needs (M+S rating, comfort, 
loading etc.) They are pricey but designed for European vans like the type2.
I don't think they do a reinforced 185R14 anymore (current generation vans
run
on 15&quot; rims, so would use the &quot;195/70R15 Reinforced&quot; Agilis 41 with a 97S
rating) but there's a couple of 185R14C models: the Agilis 61 in a 99S 
rating (&quot;6-ply rating&quot;) and Agilis 81 in a 102R (&quot;8-ply rating&quot;). I have the
latter (though on 15&quot; rims) on my camper and am very pleased with the 
stability.

 Don't let the tyre dealer fob you off with whatever he has in stock! The
right tyres _are_ available and it _does_ make a difference.

Cheers,
