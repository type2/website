&gt; Sorry to say this, but it may be too late for these

[good advice snipped]

Derrick: drive it to the next auto glass shop without
the glass, and have them install the windshield.
Then drive home, and install the rest yourself.  It
isn't that hard to do.  If the auto glass shop refuses
to install *your* windshield, have them install a
new one instead.

Sorry if I got the history wrong, but I've just
unsub'ed from digest and resub'ed in single message
mode, this being the second message I've got.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
