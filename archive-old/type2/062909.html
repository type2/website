Subject: Release Bearing Question

Greetings VDubbers!

My son and I pulled our first engine this weekend (good father/son bonding
stuff)!  We bought a fresh 1600 dp to put in our '69 campmobile and intend
to tear down the 1600 sp engine and rebuild it over the winter.  

Anyway, I have a question about the clutch release bearing.  My manuals
indicate that the bearing should turn freely and the face of it should be
shiney and unmarred.  The face of my bearing has what appears to be what's
left of some sort of thin plastic coating (about 1/4 of the bearing face
still has this coating on it).  Inside the bell housing, covered in oil that
is leaking from the engine front seal, are other pieces of the same
material.  Is this coating something that should have been removed prior to
it going on?  Should I buy a new release bearing?

On another note, I know that I have to use a &quot;doghouse&quot; style fan shroud
(and other dual port unique pieces of tin) but can I use the fan from my
existing setup?

Thanks for you help.  I love this list!
