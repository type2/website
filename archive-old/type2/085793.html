Subject: Re: [T2] Door speakers/headlight relays/FRS radio

When I bought my bus, it had (small, shoddy) speakers wired into the 
doors... the wires were out in the open, and I'm not happy with this set-up. 
Once, I closed the door on a loose wire and it snapped in half! Of course, 
they're tucked carefully away now, but they're still pretty ugly. I'd go 
with a piece of rubber tubing. That was my plan for when I get around to 
upgrading the speakers.

&gt;contacts rubbed against each other). He has also used a small piece of
&gt;rubber tubing as a conduit on another car. I've used just plain wire with
&gt;decent results but I expect that it would only last a year or so from
&gt;constant bending.
