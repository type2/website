X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

To all those who suggested that I check out the Bosch Troubleshooting guides
for my FI problems, thank you.  I was able to discover the following.

-  The double relay was defective.
-  The pump relay on the airflow sensor was not disconnecting the fuel pump
when the key was in the ON position.  As a consequence, the fuel pump burned
up and has since been replaced and the airflow sensor problem corrected.
-  All other FI tests checkout (except for the steps that require removal of
the injectors, which I haven't done).

Unfortunately, the vehicle will not run.  It will start and not stay
running.

The engine is a rebuilt AVP (2000) with my top end stuff (FI, distributor,
etc.).  I don't think there is a compression issue.  I am leaning towards a
flooding problem related to the injectors or a faulty computer.

Any other thoughts?  Any way to test the computer and what exactly does the
computer do?

Thanks - Mike
