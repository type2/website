To all out there who have the pleasure of owning one of these delightful
conversions....( Dormobile/Martin Waller )..please can you contact me at the
following e-mail address:  garp4liis_at_thefree_dot_net     as I'd like to know of
any clubs dedicated specifically to these vehicles and there are a few
queries specific to these vehicles that I'd like to put to the &quot; floor &quot;.
With many thanks.
Garp
