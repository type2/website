Subject: Re: Future Travel

Tim, it sure sounds like it was a great trip that can't be summarized in
a few paragraphs. Biagio, go for it now, and bon voyage ! I lived on
three continents and visited all of them so far; a lot of nice and
exciting places in far away and exotic places all around the world, but
our own backyard (the US and Canada) is still number one to me,
especially in a VW bus. I hope some day (with 4 kids, certainly not
before retirement) I'll find time to report on my most memorable trips
(Montreal to Mexico, the Dempster Highway, Yellowknife to Quebec City,
etc.).

On top of some tools and a few essential spare parts (belt, plugs, etc.)
and good tires, I never leave home without a cell phone and my
CAA/AAA membership card. From experience and whatever vehicle you own,
the road assistance you get for 40-50 bucks/year is invaluable. I also
never take the road without my LIMBO traveler directory. Lots of fellow
bus enthusiasts listed out there to turn to for assistance or just to
visit on the way. And of course our own type 2 list if you bring your
computer on the road.
