Interesting.  I'll admit I hadn't thought of that.

&gt;In a clean motor of adequate lubrication service interval, the insides will
&gt;be as clean as the day it was assembled regardless the milage and the oil
&gt;will stay clean throughout its acceptable use interval.

Here again I have to disagree.  Although my brain tells me you should be
correct, all of my experience tells me otherwise.  The two vehicles I
presently own both get fully synthetic oil and oil changes at 3-4k mile
intervals and have had same for the last 70,000+ miles.  One engine (the
bus) has had synthetics since it was brand new.  They are both spotless on
the inside, and they both have black oil by 3k miles.  In fact, the oil
only stays &quot;clean&quot; looking for the first few hundred miles, and after that
becomes various darker shades of brown.  I am fairly certain that this is a
result of combustion gasses entering the oil as it is most certainly not
due to dissolving built-up varnish in this case.  All I can offer is a
theory that in the newest engines with their tighter tolerances there is
less of this transfer of combustion gasses, and hence the oil stays clear
longer, resulting in a longer recommended service interval.

&gt;Compare the feel of
&gt;your black oil to the feel of fresh oil. If you can feel grittiness, so can
&gt;your bearings, rings, cam lobes, oil pump...... Do you accept that the feel
&gt;of the oil can provide empirical evidence?? Try it.

I cannot be certain that I feel grittiness, but then I don't think that my
fingers are sensitive enough to tell the grit from the imperfections in my
skin.  I don't doubt that black oil is gritty, in fact it amazes me that
bearings last as long as they do, especially in cases like the older Toyota
engines that could withstand the abuse of 20,000 mile oil changes and
50,000 mile air filter changes and still go 200,000 miles.  If I had to
base an oil change interval on self-gathered empirical evidence, I would
recommend a 500 mile interval!  But we all know that we mustn't listen to
our inner voice all the time.

&gt;&gt;Hmmm... I would be hesitant to claim that any T1, T2, or T3 type II will
&gt;&gt;outlast a T4 if serviced properly.  There have just been too many advances
&gt;&gt;in engine design, lubrication, cooling, etc.
&gt;
&gt;And added things to go wrong, like electric pop up push button Bozos. Can
&gt;you imagine the effort and cost involved in replacing all the non
&gt;functioning wizbang on a Eurovan when it gets to be 30 years old???
&gt;Electric windows and heated seats are Chic, till they go wrong and the cost
&gt;of restoring function is addressed.

I have thought the same thing myself.  On the plus side, going to the
junkyards is much more fun now, as there is an increasing bounty of gauges,
switches, motors, and other electrical parts that can be salvaged for other
projects.  In my original statement above though, I was only referring to
the engine itself, not the rest of the vehicle.

&gt;&gt;I left a set of plugs in my Mustang (snip)
&gt;
&gt;Cast iron is not aluminum.

True.  In an aluminum cylinder head like my bus I would not be able to
sleep nights if I didn't remove the plugs at least once every 10k miles and
reapply anti-sieze to the threads.  But I wouldn't put in new plugs, which
was the point I was trying to make.

I might get flamed for saying this, but I really wish that VW cylinder
heads were cast iron.  I would gladly pay a 50lb weight penalty for the
added durability of iron in that area.  Think about it - no more stripped
spark plug threads, no more dropped valve seats, no more exhaust studs
pulling out.  Wouldn't that be nice?
