&gt; in your spare time just something that happened to us and maybe for those with triple aaa......or considering it always two passengers riding back under policy never more than that.
&gt; so prepare to leave someone behind..... or alot of your family behind.... hope you werent traveling to far from home....
&gt; &quot;Most folks dont get towed but short distances anyways&quot; right? that is only one thing said by dispatch at triple AAA

at one point a couple years ago when I had my van towed via triple A they
showed up with a rollback that had a crewcab, good for 5 people and if I
recall it actually had 4 seatbelts in the back so I guess 6 people could
have squeezed in....   I was alone so it wasn't a big deal but I suspect
if you need it you could at least ask.

I guess somewhere in the dark reaches of that thing I call a memory I was
aware of this, but seems that with families traveling this would come up
more than occasionally.
