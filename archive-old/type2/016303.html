Subject: Brake fluid reservoir for 68 type 2

Hope this will help the other folks who needed this part.  When you
can't find what ya need, adapt something else ( not the first time,
won't be the last).  :-)


After trying in vain to locate a good used or NOS reservoir, I decided
to adapt one from another model to work. Ended up using a new reservoir
intended for  a 61-66 (gasp!) beetle (single circuit model, one outlet
on the reservoir). Had to mount  the reservoir on the back of the fresh
air box (?), as it wouldn't fit where the original was, plus I needed
room to run a hose (about 6&quot;) from the bottom, to the tube leading to
the master. Fashioned a bracket from thin stainless steel strap. The
only other thing I had to do was make a grommet to fit in the top of the
tube. Found a rubber part that needed some minor trimming at the local
parts store, and after working with it (I put a plastic adapter in the
hole, chucked it into my drill, and held it against some sandpaper till
enough rubber was removed) got a tight seal. Two hose clamps, and some
Permatex on the joints for some reassurance, and so far it seems to be
leak-free. The parts guy thought that plastic tubing would work better
than rubber hose (of course, he didn't have said tubing), but I'll keep
an eye on it to make sure it doesn't dry out and deteriorate. Also, I
touched up the trail the leaking fluid ate on the wheel arch (on the
less-than-one month old paint job). Looking sweet yet again!

A comment on another thread...I installed an inline blower from JC
Whipme a couple years ago, still works well, actually does defrost
(defog anyway) the windshield! Of course, that's in our usually less
than severe Richmond weather. Plus, the loaf stays home when the weather
is really nasty (I prefer to give the risk-taking to my  non-classic
vehicles).
