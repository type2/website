Subject: heat the driver cool das bus

If you want your air cooled bus water assisted I suggest you move to
the Pacific North West. We ar supposed to have wet soggy weather for
the next decade or so!
   As to the heater boxes... Bry's in Seattle has stacks of them. email
me direct I will get you the number and if you are a loooong ways away
from Seattle I will go down and pick em out for you and have them put
aside awaiting your check.    C Ya! Dan in Renton
