Subject: Body repair panels

(I'm reposting this question because I posted it just prior to the list
going down this past weekend and judging from the lack of response I
thought it might have been lost in cyberspace...)
Hi fellow listees;
   I'm seeking input on the availability/quality of various body parts.
Specifically, the two rear corners (lower portion), the panel that goes
under the engine lid, between those rear corners and the battery tray
areas, both left and right sides.
   All this stuff is pretty ate up on my bus and while the engine is out

I think I'll have the body work done, seems it would be easier on the
body dude that way anyhow.
   Does anybody have any feedback on body parts from the following
sources: RMMW, JC Whipme, Bus Depot etc? Is there any difference in
quality or do all the parts come from the same place and just get sold
for different prices at different places?
   I've been real pleased with the stuff I've gotten from the Bus Depot
so far, but I can't seem to locate all the necessary parts on the Depot
web page (It could be just me not finding them).
   Prices vary considerably for these parts. Local source gave me
incredibly inflated prices so I'm going to get them elsewhere.

Thanks;
Art Lynch
