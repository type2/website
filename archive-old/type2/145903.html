Subject: Re: [T2] Westfalia: Baywindow or Vanagon?

If a guy has a bunch of time on his hands, and doesn't mind crusin' at a
monotonous at 50-60 mph all day the Bay's are neat.
Nice looking vehicles's and cozy for sure.

A real pain to work on,but doable.

The 80 to 83.5 Vanagon's gained some creature comforts, but it's pretty
much the same snails pace on the road.
Same ain to work on the engine's.

The 83.5 to 85 Vanagon's gained some heat, AC and bumped the highway
speed's allowed for an extedned time, but you bought a steel coolant
pipe leaker, and the Digijet engine management system was just OK.

1.9's pull pretty hard and long.

Not too bad to work on--a bunch easier than the suitcase engine's of the
later bay's.

86 to 91's got a lower ride, a little boost in power, plastic cooling
lines that don't rust out ( but fracture ), better AC system, more
brakes, and the Digifant engine managemnet system is a big improment.
Can be a monster, but if a guy gets it all ironed out it can and will be
a dependable ride.

Some guys talk about the weak lower ends of the 2.1's.

I have yet to smoke one, and I don't pussy foot around with them, I
drive the Van's.

No problems with the engine's themselves.

I currently have 3 VW's.
A 74 type 2 Westy, 87 Westy, and an 89 Carat.

The first VW Van Ihad was a 85 GL, and it's still running somewhere out
there in VW land---

The 1.9 is a tough engine for sure.
