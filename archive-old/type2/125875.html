Subject: Re: [T2] platinum plugs revisited

  At the SEMA show a couple years back I talked to the BOSCH engineers and he stated not to use platium or any other of the Bosch plugs 
except the original single electroid styles. On another note he also stated that BOSCH plugs are not recomended on any older air cooled 
engine!!! Something to do with oil blow by causeing the plugs to foul. Myth or truth I do know, I only use NGK's.

&gt;Folks,
&gt;
&gt;Was looking for something else and came across this on a site on Mercedes.
&gt;
&gt;On a 30-50 year old Mercedes-Benz with original components, the 
&gt;distributor cap, rotor and ignition wires will need replacing.  Last but 
&gt;not least, you will need a set of new and properly gapped spark plugs - DO 
&gt;NOT USE PLATINUM SPARK PLUGS!  Mercedes-Benz specifically advises against 
&gt;these for all engines up into the 1990s
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Interesting...no?...and this is even for water cooled engines...
&gt;
&gt;Karl,....seen that in any of your tech bulletins?
&gt;
&gt;Cheers, dave
