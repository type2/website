Subject: Dual Carburetor Set-up.

Hey guys, one more question....


	One of the things that came with my Bus was a set of dual carbs and
a set of &quot;Intake manifolds&quot; or plenums, not sure... in any case... my Bus
DOES run pretty decently right now, but I'd like to get some more
horsepower. Presently, I have a 1.8 Motor with Hydraulic lifters (GEX). The
carburetor I have already on there is a brand new 2-bbl Webber carburetor.
The exhaust is some sort of performance aftermarket muffler set-up. It has
dual mufflers and  a set of twin tips on each side.  My question is, if I
convert to these dual carburetors.. will I actually see any horsepower
increase.. or performance increase with my present engine configuration? Is
it worth it for me to do this swap? 

	The dual carb kit apparently has everything there.. the throttle
bodies, the intake pieces, the dual K&amp;N filter pieces. But I don't see any
linkage pieces. I'm assuming that each carb would go on one side of the
motor, and that they wouldn't be connected like the single carburetor is
now. 

Has anyone ever done this conversion before? How did it handle?


Thanks,
