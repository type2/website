Subject: battery wont stay charged.

brand new battery in my 78 auto trans westy.  the battery will not stay 
charged for more than a day.  nothing is on, i dont have a short(i dont 
think).  this sucks.  it all started when i left the lights on one day at 
school.  then it just would not hold a charge.  I got 2 new batterys, and 
they wont hold a charge either.  

im lost, someone please help.

thanks,
brennan.
