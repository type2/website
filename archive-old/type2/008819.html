&gt; Hey Volks!
&gt; The clutch just went on my '70 bus,so I guess now is the best time
&gt; to rebuild the engine since it'll have to come out anyways.The engine
&gt; in her now is a '74 Type1 1600cc.Is there anything I could do to 
&gt; this engine to give her more power but still keep her fairly simple
and 
&gt; stock,or would it be better to just go for a bigger VW engine from a 
&gt; later '70's bus?I want to be able to get up hills on the highway at a 
&gt; somewhat normal speed(ie.-not 40mph).Would modifying the Type1 make
her 
&gt; go faster or would a real Type2 one be better?

First, some terminology:
US-spec buses up to '71 used Type 1 engines as were used in the Type 1
(bug) sedan.  From '72 on, buses used Type 4 engines as were used in
the Type 4 (411, 412) automobiles.  There never was a Type 2 engine
specific to buses.

Now on to your question:

Most engines are cooling-limited when it comes to maximum sustained
(hill climbing) power.  Aircooled VWs follow this rule.  Yes, you can
build a surprisingly powerful type 1 engine, but it won't be able to
_sustain_ that power without overheating, as there is no easy way to
increase its cooling capacity.  You can increase the oil cooling
capacity, but the cylinder and head cooling will remain unchanged. 
Since a big engine will have to get rid of more heat, the heads and
cylinders have to run hotter to increase the rate of heat transfer. 
The maximum evolution of the Type 1 VW was 1600cc, and the cooling
system was designed for this displacement.

You could go to a Type 4 engine, which was designed for a displacement
of 2000cc.  This would get you up hills a bit faster, but you won't be
doing 75 in the fast lane, either!

If you want to go the Type 4 route, I'd advise simply getting a later
model bus that already has a Type 4 engine.  Why go through all the
hassle of adapting the type 4 engine into your early engine
compartment when they are available already set up?

Personally, I think that the ability to go up hills at highway speeds
is overrated.  The amount of time that most folks are climbing hills
is rather small.  On a recent trip from LA to Reno, NV, I kept track
of the time spent at hill-climbing speed.  Turns out that if I were
able to sustain flatland cruising speed over hills, it would have
saved me about 12 minutes on an 8-hour trip over four 7-8000 ft.
Sierra Nevada passes. Balance this against the time to engineer and
perform an engine swap and you'll see that you would have to do a
_lot_ of mountain driving to save any time at all!  I'd rather spend
the time watching the scenery!

&gt; Almost forgot!-Does anyone have an opinion on what company makes the 
&gt; best clutch?

Sachs makes a pretty fair one.
