Subject: [T2] again, the dreaded squeak

well, since i didn't get any responses to my last post, i'll try again.,
i am getting a squeak from my front right wheel when
coasting, or driving in 1st or 2nd gear.
i'm guessing it's a wheel bearing, but i could use  2nd opinion. it
seems to stop when i hit the brake. it also takes a bit of driving to
get it to happen.
