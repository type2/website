There's a great &quot;database&quot; web app called &quot;Webteacher's Webdata&quot;,
licensing is cheap, he may even GIVE you a copy for free as it's
nonprofit and and public service...  Fella's name is Rob Young.

Webdata allows users to own their own records and manage them with
password protection.  Admin has full access.  The resultant database is
fully searchable.  It allows for links and pics, too...

It'd be the perfect thing for AIRS.  The static pages are really a
pain...

I offered once before to do this for AIRS, but never got a reply...

A working copy can be seen at:

http://www.volks-web_dot_com/X3Com/directory/

And there's also flattext:

http://flattext_dot_com/classb/

Where you can build yor own script online, from what I recall I think
you can set it up with the same type of self-management features. 
Doesn't take a genius, but you must understand something about data
organization...

THEN the thing to do is to have as many of the fields as make sense as
dropdowns so that you maintain the integrity of the info - states for
example.  Forcing the user to choose from a drop down ensures that the
info is consistent - and therefore much more searchable...  Eliminates
variations like CA, ca, cal, etc...
