&gt;In the US, it is quite common to have a campfire, either for cooking or

And in B.C. public campgrounds have finally started to suggest that campers
limit their use of wood to what amounts to three armloads per day.  Lots of
people get to a campground and immediately, no matter what the time or the
weather, light a huge campfire.  Guess they feel that it's not camping
without a fire.
Ian, who obviously thinks that's dumb.
