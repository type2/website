Subject: AL82 vs AL78, changed, now fan binds..

Hey folks...

Few weeks ago (or something!), the alternator on Ichigo (originally from
my 74 super, from pulley to fan, and external regulator..AL78) finally
went caput.

Got a new AL82N to install, new pulley, too, since extracting the other
required copious amounts of heat and force, and put it on last night.

Used the same fan, backing plate, shims, etc, from the old one.  this
morning, I attached an old pulley off of a gen I had laying around (the
new pulley is seriously warped...), installed it, and went to bolt the
shroud to the engine.  Attached the strap, and turned the alt.  nogo!

With a good bit of force, it turned.  Fan dragging against the shroud!:(

Undid the strap, and it spun, and only touched a little.  Pulled it all
off, and looked at where it was binding.  frontmost edge of the fan is
dragging on the bottom of its &quot;space&quot; in the shroud.

Removed 1 shim, to see if that helped, reinstalled, still binding.

Does a 82 require a different backing plate then a 78?  Any OTHER ideas
why this one binds and the old one never did?  (i installed it the end of
august, 2 years ago, had the engine out and apart numerous times for
different reasons, never had any trouble...other then the bearings telling
me they had to many miles on them....:)

Looking for ideas....

thanks...david
