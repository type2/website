Subject: Re: [T2] carb setup 1600


Get yourself a vacuum advance distributor.  The carb should be just fine, 
assuming the exhaust is stock.  If you MUST upgrade the carb, I like the 
dual 34 or 36mm setup(pick your maker).

Rigth know i am running the stock solex 34 on our 71 bus 1600, with bosch 
009
dizzy, everything else is stock. What is a good upgrade for the carb and
should this be 1st.
