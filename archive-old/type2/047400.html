Hi all, I am still looking for a '74 column switch/stalk for the wipers with 
electric contact for headlight washers.  I finally found the partnumber for it:

211 955 501 D 

Please contact me if you have or find it somewhere, I'd greatly appreciate 
it if you'd ask your (local) parts guru. VW discontinued this part years ago. 
Or if you see a '74 Baywindow with headlight washers in a junkyard.... 

TIA,

Brian
