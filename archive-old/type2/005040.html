Subject: Re: Main Seal Leak?

When my main seal started leaking there was oil on the clutch disk and it
slipped.  Also there was oil all over the rear of the bus.  On the bumper,
and the engine hatch. FWIW......

&gt;I'm thinking about buying a '78 Riviera conversion. It leaks oil pretty
&gt;bad on the bottom of the engine. If I run my hand across it, it gets
&gt;soaked in oil. Is there any way I can tell for sure if it is the main
&gt;seals leaking or if it is the push rod tube seals that are leaking (or
&gt;maybe something else) Any help is very much appreciated. I don't want to
&gt;buy something that's going to have big problems. Thanks.
