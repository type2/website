Subject: fuel injection question

Hello all,
OK, I have a generic fuel injection question, but it's not a VW.  My
girlfriend's '87 Plymouth Sundance is acting up, but the reason I'm
asking here is that the FI system appears to be a Bosch derivative,
possibly a continuous system.

I will also look in my Bosch FI book for the answer, but perhaps some of
you have experienced similar symptoms on your vans.

Symptoms:  loss of power, particularly at highway speeds, stumbling and
lurching at idle (automatic trans. car), very excessive fuel
consumption.

Prior to this incident the car has been sitting for about 3 weeks
without running at all.  When it was parked it ran fine.  She tried to
start it a couple of days ago but the battery was COMPLETELY dead.  We
took it to Pep Boys and had them charge and test it and it tested as a
good battery.  Later, on a drive around town, we noticed some hunting at
idle, i.e. rpm increasing and decreasing, not settling in one spot.
This weekend, she took a road trip and the above problems showed up.  It
sounds to me like a fi problem rather than just needing a tune up.

Possibilities:  I have a hunch that is telling me oxygen sensor.  Does
that make sense to anyone?  That's my gut feeling.  I was thinking fuel
filter for a while, but that doesn't fit with the excessive fuel
consumption symptom.  

I know this is a VW list, but she really likes my bus, if that helps.  I
know, I know, what's wrong with the car is the fact that it says
Plymouth on it :) but I figure you folks may have run into a similar
problem with your fi systems.

Thanks in advance for any help,
Sean
