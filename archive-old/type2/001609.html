&gt; Are there different lengths of plastic filler pipe?
&gt; (I don't know if it has been replaced, possibly.)
&gt; Were the early years different than the later years?

If memory serves me right there are 3 tanks. All will probably fit but the
filler pipes are different. Two were used on non fuel injected buses (gas
and diesel). The early models had a metal filler pipe. Later models had a
plastic filler pipe with a different diameter. So when you have an early
model and you change the tank for a later model you have to change the
filler pipe as well.That will work (done that). I'm not aware of filler pips
that have different lengths.
