Subject: Re: [T2] clutch from 1700 with 2000 engine

Hi Volks,

Last summer Dave Ireland &lt;direland_at_golden_dot_net&gt; put a 2L engine into his 73
automatic bus using the original 73 dual carbs. He was told that Mikuni jets
for Yamaha motorcycles fit the solex carbs, and are $CDN3.00 each from a
Yamaha dealer. They worked fine for him.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt;&gt; My post wasn't very clear, I'm afraid.
&gt;&gt; I'm having a new engine put into my 73 Bus. My bus is stock with the
&gt;&gt; original clutch and tranny. What I was wondering, is will the 2000cc engine
&gt;&gt; be a direct replacement without modification to the stock 73 clutch? Are any
&gt;&gt; other modifications needed for the 2000? If so, I will go with the 1800cc
&gt;&gt; engine.
&gt;&gt; Thanks,
&gt; 
&gt; The 2.0 will bolt in if you use the 73 flywheel and clutch.
&gt; I am assuming you will be using the 73 carbs? If yes, then you will need a
&gt; small electric fuel pump. The 2.0L has no provisions for a mechanical pump [in
&gt; the USA].
&gt; Use all the engine tin from the 1700, along with all the exhaust from the 73.
&gt; And the 73 alternator support.
&gt; One thing I would do is find bigger jets for the carbs. They went bigger from
&gt; 1700 to 1800. Now you are going 200 cc larger. Got a 68-79 Bentley? If yes, go
&gt; to section 3, page 30. That page shows all the differences between the carbs
&gt; for 72 to 74.
