&gt; Met with listee Andrew Stockton this week. He raided our local yards for metal bits to appease the corrosion gods in Connecticut. He was successful at the local VW-only yard where you're lucky if they'll sell you less than an entire door if you need a lock.

Finally back in Connecticut after a two week trip to California, Arizona and Nevada (bus stayed home).  Had a chance to meet with list members Harry Houck and Karl (aufever) in Fresno.  Had a great time with them.  Harry gave my family a ride in his 67 DC with
the Safari windows wide open.  Thanks Harry.  You can just imagine how excited they get about a 71 Bay Window Westfalia after that ride.  Karl explained the advantages of the Type IV engine and gave me demonstration of what low end torque in a Splitty is all
about.  Karl, I didn't realize that Fresno had increased the speed limit on Fruit Ave. by 30 mph since I left there 30 years ago.

Fresno is certainly the place for buses.  Unlike Connecticut where people keep them garaged to protect them from the salt, Fresnans keep them in the open and on the road.  And if you want to work on yours, just pull your engine and leave it in the driveway
until you get time to finish the job.  After all, it's probably not going to rain for another month.

Thanks to Harry and Karl.  I hope we can do it again sometime soon.
