Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Bay Lid

Hey Tyler,
I'm heading to the junk yard tomorrow (50% off day).  Want me to pick you out a
dry southern california lid from one of the many bay vintage busses in the
yard?

Scott

&gt;      About 1 month ago my bus (79 Westy) was rear-ended while parked on the
&gt; side of the road. The engine bay lid  was damaged beyond repair. [...]
&gt;  So my question to the
&gt; list is does anyone have or no where I can get a real nice used Engine Bay
&gt; Lid for a 79 Westy?
