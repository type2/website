Thanks to everybody who gave me suggestions on how to get the drum off. I
finally got it off today (1 down, 1 to go). The problem was not that the
drum was stuck with rust to the hub, it really was that the shoe was not
backed off enough to release the drum, I could pull it off a little bit,
but then it would hang up on the shoe. I should have been clearer. After
MUCH liquid wrench and some VERY hard WACKS with a hammer on the end of a
screwdriver stuck on the adjusting star I finally got it to move, and got
the shoe backed off enough that I could get the drum off.

The next problem I ran into was that the lever that the hand brake cable
operates was attached to the shoe with a flanged pin, and thus was not
removable. Since this is my first brake job on this car, I thought maybe I
had gotten the wrong shoes since this lever was missing, but a call to
my FLAVWPS informed me that in fact the lever is usually attached with a
removable pin and transfered from shoe to shoe. I asked if they had the
pins in stock, and of course they were out. So as a temporary solution I
went to the hardware store and got a bolt of the right dimention, and a
nylon lock nut. Unfortunately it has gotten too dark for me to finish the
ressmbly, but I will order the pins I need tomorrow, and hopefully
finish up this drum and do the other side tomorrow. When the pins come in
I will have to take the drums off all over again, but I can't wait 7 days
for them since this is my daily driver.

Thanks again volks for all your help!

-Nick
