Subject: [T2] Crew Cab and Vanagon Transporter the same?

Is anyone on this list in an area that has Vanagon based VW pick ups?  I want 
to know if the cargo bed floor design is the same as an earlier type II.  
Since I have been unable to find a donor floor for my truck I may consider 
using those from a vanagon transporter.
Help would be appreciated.

Dave
