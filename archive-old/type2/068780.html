&gt;Drumbrakes have spring tension on the shoes, brake system engineers
&gt;used a little residual pressure in the brake system to help keep foreign
&gt;material out (dirt &amp; water), the master cylinder will have a so-called
&gt;bottom valve (freely translated) that provides this, it will allow brake
&gt;fluid to flow back into the mastercylinder and reservoir after braking,
&gt;but when the pressure in the system drops to a certain value it will
&gt;close and the system will remain presurized but not enough to overcome
&gt;the springtension on the shoes. A diskbrake only has rubber rings in the
&gt;calipers to pull the pistons back into their rest position after braking,
&gt;so connecting a disk brake to a drum brake circuit could cause the pads
&gt;to touch the disc all the time. I dono if VW used the bottom valve on
&gt;Busses, but look into this if you're about to install disks on your
&gt;originally drum brake equipped Bus.

I agree with both gentlemen! The '70 neunsitzer has the front  off a 73
camper; I couldn't find a good vacuum servo, so I left the drum brake
master cylinder on. It works JUST FINE, and has for four years. EXCEPT.
That the right front rotor is slightly warped, and this, combined with
Brian's explanation, causes that pad to rub against the rotor at all times,
causing pedal pulsing and a godawfully annoying road noise. I plan to
replace both rotors soon, needless to say. I would opine that the key here
is to get NEW or rebuilt pistons (you could do this yourself), a FLAT
rotor, and a properly functioning master cylinder; if everything's wear
tolerances are  ok, the amount of pad/rotor contact should be minimal... I
know its  less than the RRear drum drag!

BTW - make sure you have a proportioning valve between the master and rear
brake cylinders if you add front disks!
