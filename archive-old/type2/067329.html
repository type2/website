The Kombi model is a panel van, but with windows, not either a single nor
doublecab pickup.  Basically just like a bus but stripped.  On mine, the
side windows don't open.  

I don't know whether your standard is measured on the current Kombi, which
is your basic EuroVan, or on the Vanagon Kombi, your basic Vanagon/Caravelle.
Either way, .46 COF is pretty bad, much worse that I'd heard before (and
much worse than Bob reported for the old splitty).  The frontal area sounds
about right, regardless of the style.
