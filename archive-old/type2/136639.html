&gt; Is a Cold Start Valve any different than a normal fuel injector, or

The cold start valve is absolutely different in form and function.  While
I suppose you could make an injector work for a while, fabricating a mount
would be difficult.  After you had fabbed the mount and the bypass (normal
injectors are branches off the fuel ring, the cold start valve is inline
in the ring), the injector would not last but a month or two would be my
bet. Normal injectors are meant to be pulsed for thousandths of a second,
the cold start cycle is 20-60 seconds of continuous operation.  I don't
think that a normal injector woudl be able to dissipate the heat of
continuous operation and would overheat and burn out in short order.

OOK!
