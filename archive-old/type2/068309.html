Subject: Re: Busses as off-road vehicles

&gt;last time i was off-roading in the mountains I got a flat tire...and i
&gt;had to stop every few minutes to let the old brakes have a rest......
&gt;(poured water on them ...... )

This is worth emphasizing. Your bus, loaded for camping, probably weighs
between four and six thousand pounds, depending on how much stuff you're
dragging along. Those of us with drum brakes all around should bear in mind
that while busses might be better than the average van at *going* off road,
they are not very good at *stopping* even under the best of circumstances.

Serious off-roaders regard disc brakes as a first-tier upgrade, it's
something you've GOT to do--and bear in mind that these people have four
wheel drive plus low transfer cases so they can brake all four wheels very
effectively with the engine. Many of them have low gears with ratios in the
triple digits--and they still regard disc brakes as crucial.

When remote driving gets dangerous, it usually gives you no warning. It's
just about the most fun you can legally have--until you screw up, when it
gets very dangerous very quickly. Brake fade or failure is one of the
things that can get you stranded or dead. I don't want to be a killjoy,
here, there is no reason to avoid light off-road driving in your bus, but
turn around BEFORE the grade gets critical, because you won't be able to do
it after. Busses ain't Jeeps and they never will be.
