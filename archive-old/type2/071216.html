Yeah I was thinking about getting the &quot;Pertronix Flame Thrower&quot; coil to
replace my &quot;Blue Coil&quot; when I upgrade to an electronic ignition this spring,
can I just make the swap without doing anything else?

Thanks,
Tripps

&lt;&lt; Hello there!
 
 I have a 1971 AS engine with generator and original black coil. Can I swap
 this for a blue coil easily? without any extra wiring bother? and will it
give
 any increase in mpg or performance?
 
 thanks all. adam &gt;&gt;
