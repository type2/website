Come New Years Day, my 78 FI Westy and I will be on our way to Boulder,
CO.  I'm looking forward to see how she handles the wind, mountains and
the cold.  Other than my bike, she will be my only personal
transportation.  I plan to haul her to CO behind a U-Haul, with all four
wheels off the ground.  Does anybody have any experiences or words of
advice regarding towing a bus?

In preparation for the mountains, pulling the engine to replace the
clutch this weekend.  This will be the first engine pull I've done and
I'm excited about doing it.  I also plan to do various preventive
maintenance while I'm in there:  new fuel lines, clean engine
compartment, clean battery trays and coat with rust prohibitor, possibly
remove gas tank and have cleaned and glass lined?  Anything else I
should do while the engine is out?

TIA, keep on bussin'

Alabama Pete and Kate
