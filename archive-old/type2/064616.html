&gt; climbing in there and giving it a sponge bath. Amusing to the neighbors to

&gt; buying a rustproofers wand and using my air compressor, but I'd worry I
&gt; missed something. Have any of you listie truckers dealt with this?

If you are using the acid etching material, or some such, you can apply 
it with a cheap plastic garden sprayer. I have one that holds a bit more 
than a quart, cost about $5, and is all plastic (nothing to corrode). It 
looks like an oversized plant mister, but you pressurize the tank by 
pumping a small piston on top. It's small, with a short nozzle, and is 
easy to direct.

Wear goggles and gloves. Spray the material on, then wipe off the 
excess.
