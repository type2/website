depends on how good you can hear stuff like that. My ears aren't very
good at hearing stuff like that myself, so I use a different technique
to help identify a cyl that is not firing.

Hook a tach up to the engine. then with the engine running pull a plug
wire from the distributor. If that cyl was firing (this includes
building compression as well as firing) then pulling the spark from
that cyl will result in a lower rpm. Replace the wire &amp; the rpm should
return to normal. If you pull one &amp; the engine doesn't respond then
something is wrong with that cyl.
