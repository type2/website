Subject: EGA machine f/s

    This might be of interest to the more hardcore home mechanics out there 
particuarily those of you that have to pass smog. Selling a Hamilton ega 
machine, this is pro shop grade and came from a shop that owed me money. Has 
the calibration bottle and filters. $650.00 obo or interesting trades. Bus 
content, met some more listee's today, Don, his wife, friends Mark and Craig, 
nice volks. We've almosr got enough for a Corona AIRS chapter ; )
