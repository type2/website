Jim:
2 or 3 major oil bottlers (I hesitate to call them refiners anymore as I notice several brands all share the same address!) are doing this, I've seen Quaker State synth blend or something and some others. It couldn't hurt. I'd probably keep to the same brand just to keep the additive package similar, but whether this could POSSIBLY cause problems is so esoteric, I doubt even a good lab could measure!

&gt; I know we've discussed oil till we're blue in the face, but I heard something today that I've never heard of, or thought of myself.  One of the counter guys at a well-respected VW repair shop in the San Jose area told me that he's had great success using a 50/50 mixture of Redline synthetic oil and regular old Dino oil.
