What did AVP say about the head? If they could assure you that after
the break in it should be golden, or if not they will replace it I'd
go ahead and just run it. After all if you follow the std procedure
(and I know you will Richard) you'll pull the engine to retorque the
heads soon after it get 500ish miles :)
