Subject: Re: [T2] Electronic ignition opposed to points &amp; condenser

I too am faced with this option..a petronix kit to go in my distributor.

I have concluded that I should just use my 009 in my type 4 200cc bus
because I am running dual 40 Weber IDF's.

Would the petronix help me or hurt me?

&gt; Hey everybody,
&gt;
&gt; The dude at the parts shop I go to tried to sell me an electronic ignition
&gt; replacement module instead of putting in new points and condenser. He says
&gt; he runs one in his bus, and rarely has trouble with it. Does anybody have
&gt; any info or experience with these devices?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
