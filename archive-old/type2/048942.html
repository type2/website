I was thinking of doing the reverse. The DP and SP have different heads and
manifold. The SP used a smaller carb (30pict(x) and the DP 34 pict(X) so you
may need an adaptor to fit the carb to the manifold and or to clear the
generator.

&gt; hey everybody,
&gt; I was just wondering, I have 2 1600 single port engines and was
&gt; wondering if I could Rip one apart and rebuild it with dual port heads.  It
&gt; seems as if I should be able to do so, but I figured you guys would know
&gt; alot better than I would.
