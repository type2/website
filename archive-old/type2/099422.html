Subject: Re: [T2] Carburetor assembly adhesive?

Get a thread FORMING (NOT cutting) tap sized just a bit larger than the 
hole. Form new threads. This will anneal the hole and reduce it's size. 
Then ream to a thou or 2 less than the jet base. I would use non-hardening 
Permatex, just a tiny smear, on the jet base and press it in. If needed, 
tiny pin punch and peanut hammer to tap it to it's seat. Then adjust the 
jet to spray directly at the edge of the throttle plate.

&gt;Hi,
&gt;I'm trying to maintain a 30+ year-old Solex carb. Specifically, what is 
&gt;the best way to secure the accelerator pump injector (the goose-neck brass 
&gt;tube) into its hole in the pot metal of the carb body? The hole is 
&gt;enlarged to the point where the tube is no longer a press fit,
