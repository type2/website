&gt; &gt; And a personal thanks to Mr. Dolan, for that gem about the clutch cable.
&gt; &gt; Mine is 26 years old. I'm going to get a new one, put it in place as a
&gt; &gt; preventive measure, and carry the old one as a spare.

&gt; I subscribe to the other philosophy, that which says that any part that
&gt; has been serving for two decades is less likely to fail than an unknown
&gt; new part.  Having had new clutch cables fail in the first few days of
&gt; service, I don't change one that is working well!

Doyt,

On the one hand, I am with George. I am very much of the &quot; If it ain't
broke, don't fix it!&quot; school of thought.  On the other, tho...  I tend to
spend a lot of time doing minor repairs as they happen, like in the Dixie
National Forest at 6AM :-)  I would not argue strongly either way, just so
that you have a working cable under the back seat, just in case.  The
thing that scares me worst about the Vanagon is the hydraulic clutch.  I
did replace all parts of it when I was setting out last time, but it still
scares me!  I imagine pushing the clutch pedal down 40 miles up a dirt
road in Nevada and having it flop to the floor.  Stringing a new clutch
cable is a doddle compared to bleeding a clutch by yourself in the desert.
I have a mity vac with me at all times (ask anyone... I travel a lot like
Alice's white knight :-), but I still fear that breakdown!
