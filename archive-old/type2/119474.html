Subject: fresh rebuild

Listees,

A couple months ago I did a rebuild on my typeIV 1800cc engine for my 74
westy. It is taking me forever to get the engine in and it will likely be
several more months before I get it wired. Will letting the engine sit for
a long time be detrimental? How long can I have this rebuilt engine
sitting areound for until I really NEED to turn it over?
Thanks,
74 westy in OR
