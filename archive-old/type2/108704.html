Subject: interesting weird engine failure need advice

Hello All,

I have had a weird and interesting engine failure. I am hoping that someone out there
has had a similar engine failure. What a minute. I don't intend to sound cruel. I am
sorry if anyone had a similar engine failure, but if you did, then you should know all
about the problem and the solution. For everybody else, I hope you find the problem
interesting enough to diagnose the problem and provide a solution for me to keep it from
happening again.

The puzzler is below:

I have rebuilt many air cooled carbureted 1200 to 1600 VW engines for myself and my
friends. All engines lasted at least 100,000 miles.(if the exhaust valves and exhaust
guides were replaced at 50,000 miles)

I have just rebuilt my first &quot;914&quot; type air cooled VW engine. It is a year 1978 &quot;2&quot;
liter GE case Fuel Injected.
(wow no line bore needed at 160,000 miles so std. std crank bearings)

After rebuild, the engine started perfectly, and smoked like a steam locomotive just as
expected. (I use lots of lubriplate everywhere and lots of different lubes for different
applications during rebuilding)

The smoking diminished and the engine ran almost perfectly for the first 30 minutes with
some minor fluttering during deceleration.  I changed the oil after 30 minutes. I let
the engine cool overnight, I found and repaired the vacuum leaks and the engine started
perfectly, decelerated perfectly and then KaBlouey, clack clack clack. .

The #4 cylinder intake valve rocker arm lost hold of its pushrod. The pushrod end got
stuck under the rocker arm and it started moving under the rocker and against the head
and it knocked a huge hole in the head at the valve cover sealing surface taking a piece
of the pushrod tube hole wall with it.  ( I sure hope that the head can be welded back
together, the valve cover sealing surface is critical and the o-ring sealing surface is
critical)

Before the rebuild. The engine and van had sat deader than a door nail for over ten
years. The full tank of gas had turned into really stinky varnish. I drained the tank
with a siphon. I filled it with 5 gallons of gas. I let that gas &quot;dissolve&quot; the crude
for a month or so while waiting for parts and machine shop work.  I siphoned out and
pitched that gas. I put in 5 fresh gallons of gas. I put in temporary fuel lines with a
couple of temporary fuel filters in line before the fuel pump. I had to work real hard
to get the electric fuel pump to start pumping. It first pumped out lots of thick stinky
high viscosity varnish. When it started pumping out clear thin gasoline. I hooked it up
to the bypass fuel pressure regulator and let that bypass back to the tank. I
recirculated the fuel for about 30 minutes. I siphoned out that gasoline and pitched it.
Then I put my rebuilt engine in the van. I put in 5 gallons of fresh gas before priming
up the fuel  injector circuit. Originally, all the fuel in the fuel lines before the
fuel pump and after the fuel pressure regulator had turned into thick stinky varnish. I
replaced all those lines. The fuel in between the fuel pump, around the fuel injector
circuit, and before the fuel pressure regulator, was sort of sealed in a safe place and
kept  from evaporating by being trapped in an &quot;air tight&quot; chamber.  When I first started
tearing apart the engine and I opened this &quot;sealed&quot;  fuel circuit, it was full of
stinky, but thin liquid gasoline. The injectors and cold start valve were not gummed up
and frozen shut because the engine started right up at first try, stuttered momentarily,
then ran super smooth.

The heads were rebuilt by my favorite machine shop master machinist. The heads had thick
seats that were cut to three angles on some new fangled French machine using a single
edged cutter on a mandrel aligned by floating on air (????!!) The seats looked
beautiful. The cut produced an almost mirror surface with not sign of a chatter. The
exhaust guides were replaced with the latest Silicon alloy brass. Intake and exhaust
guides were expertly honed to a perfect fit. I have never had tight or loose valve to
valve guide problems from this master machinist. The exhaust valves were replaced with
brand new Sodium filled valves. The intake valves were only replaced in one head, but I
don't remember which head it was until I do the re-tear down. I have never had problems
with intake valves. I have had the same intake valve last through several engine
rebuilds with only intake guide replacements.

At first I thought that some varnish gasoline could have contaminated the valve to valve
guide surface causing the intake valve to stick open and cause the failure. I haven't
torn the engine apart to look at the piston, head valve, rocker arms, rockers yet.

For the rebuild, I had installed brand spanking new Melling hydraulic lifters. I took
the lifters apart and filled them with oil and put them back together while they were
completely submerged in oil.  I did  have some misgivings about how the valves adjusted
: the FSM instructions said: take out the slack then turn the adjusting screw down 2
full turns. When I took out the slack, the lifters were rock solid, if I turned the
adjusting screw a full 2 turns, I could see the valve moving. So I just   took out the
slack and tightened the screw a little bit. I wanted the valves to stay fully closed
when they were supposed to be. I didn't want blowby and I want the valves to be fully
seated for heat transfer . I left zero clearance. I never heard any clatter. I had
planned to readjust the valves before I had an hours time on the engine.

Another failure cause theory I have is that the hydraulic lifter stuck in the case. But
that is unlikely because  I am always really suspect of new parts and I always make sure
that new lifters (cam followers) easily slide back and forth in their own particular
case hole. Perhaps the hydraulic lifter lost its charge and shrunk and the pushrod
escaped from its seat in the rocker arm.

Whatever the problem , I don't want to worry about it happening again.

Do you have any ideas? Have you ever heard of this happening before? What should I look
for during the re-teardown?

Thanks,

Gary G. Martin
