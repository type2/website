Subject: Re: [T2] Question for Ron the Bus Depot guy (DOH!)


Oh and I forgot to mention what a big DUMMY I was for sending the first
email to the list and not straight to you or someone else, my apologies.

DZ


&gt;Hey Ron thanks for the response, I wasnt trying to accuse you or the Bus
 Depot of anything. I have always had GREAT service from you guys and I
 understand that mess ups happen especially keeping up with and shipping
 parts to all over the US.

&gt; Thanks again
