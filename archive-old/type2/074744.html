Subject: Re: [T2] rear hatch window installation

Silicone spray- there is a difference, so get the good stuff, which is nice
and thick, and spray liberally. This along with the string &amp; bone and a
friend to push on the outside should do it. The rear is propably one of the
hardest as it is so small, tight and recessed. I replaced all the seals on
my '72 Westy, only on the last one did I discover the difference between
silicon sprays. Only then was I able to put in the drivers's rear quarter
(w/vent) by myself! And to think that this is the one I was worried about!

&gt; thanks for the replys everyone. i guess i should have been more
descriptive
&gt; on my initial post.
&gt;
&gt; suggestions that came up but that i had already tried:
&gt; -get the seal warm
&gt; -have another person help from the outside
&gt;
&gt; suggestions that i have not tried yet:
&gt; -silicone spray on the seal
&gt; -starting on the bottom edge of the window is easier
&gt; as far as 'wire', actually i used some speaker wire split in half. i dont
&gt; know the guage but its not that thick. i used the same type of wire for
the
&gt; other seals i installed a few years ago on a 73 super beetle &amp; it worked
&gt; pefectly.
&gt;
&gt; thanks again &amp; keep the suggestions coming.
&gt;
&gt; its supposed to be really warm tomorrow so i think i'll leave it in the
sun
&gt; all day &amp; give it a go when i get home from work tomorrow.
