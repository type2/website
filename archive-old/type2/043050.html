I'm sure someone has.  But, unless you retrofit some form of power
steering, it is NOT recommended.  that wheel is large to give you leverage
to turn the wheels.  Its not easy as it is.  Shorten the lever (smaller
wheel) and you increase the effort required to turn it.

&gt; Better to drive?

No.;)  Probably much much harder, and more dangerous.

&gt; Any hints for reversing a Kombi, only driven once and finally got my 
&gt; own bus. I have been told reversing is hard at first

Well, reverse is hard in anything if you've not dont it much.

A:  find a big empty parking lot to practice in first. and soon.
   Pratice backing in and out of parking spaces.

B:  since bus's are notorious about lack of rear visbility, learn to use
what mirrors you have.  Add to that the usual of looking out the rear
window..   Also, learn to open the door and hang out while backing up (at
your own risk!:) to see behind you better.  BUT dont forget about what
might be on the OTHER side of the bus while you do it!!!!!!

c:  while practicing, get something/someone to help you learn how far
things dissapear in the rear window before they hit you.

Find something about 3 feet tall, and back up towards it.  when it
disappears, stop, and go see how much further you have before you hit it.
Pratice getting close to it without hitting it.  there is a real art to
this....

good luck.

But then, i'm wierd.)
