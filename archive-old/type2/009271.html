I'm a student at Suffolk University in Boston, I work part time doing 
laundry at a nursing home and am currently looking for a full time summer 
job. I'm a Women's Studies and Psychology major and hope to also study 
massage therapy when I graduate. My dad is an electrician and mechanic as a 
hobby,so being daddy's little girl doesn't hurt. He helps me pay for some 
parts and has taught me everything I know about cars.
