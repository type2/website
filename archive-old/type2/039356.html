Subject: Happy Hunting 

Well, what a difference a day makes!  Yesterday, we were actively hunting for a 1968 to 1982 bus;  we got up this morning at 4 a.m. to drive 500 miles roundtrip to look at a bus in another part of the state--sadly (but not surprisingly), it was not what we had hoped.  However, the VW fairy had something on store for us (again).  We stopped for lunch on the way home, picked up a newspaper, and saw an add for a 1981 Westy, no details.  It was on our way home, 50 miles from our house, so we arranged to see it, and this was IT!  A 1981 Westy, Assuan Brown (I believe that's what the color is--burnt orange/brown), immaculate condition, original curtains/upholstery, 75,000 miles on it, 3000 miles on complete rebuild, new tires.  It's gorgeous! And the price --well, a very sweet deal, to say the least.  I still can't believe it!  It's not like us to buy something that doesn't need to be totally overhauled! This is ready to go on the great circle tour of the U.S. planned for this summer.
Oh, and I can guarantee it won't get 24 mpg--but you can't have everything!
