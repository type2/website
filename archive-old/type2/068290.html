Subject: Aux. Battery inst. in '72??

I'm new to the list so forgive me if this information has already been
given!!  I've seen the archives on putting an auxillary battery in a
Vanagon but what about an earlier breadloaf Westy??  It seems like there is
such a nice place for it on the left side of the engine compartment.  Would
it be as simple as hooking it in-line to the existing battery with a
shutoff so as not to drain the starting battery.  I'mm rambling but I
really want to do this so I don't keep running down the main batt. !!

Thanks
