Subject: Need to sell my panel

Hello,
I found a vanagon that I really want today and need to
sell my panel van to get the cash. My van is a 71
panel, it runs good, has some rust on the rocker,
doglegs, and the driver's floor board, and some on the
back of the front passenger side wheel well. Rust
repair estimated at 350 at local vw shop. Alright
tires and brakes, nice dash, in between 105-110k mi
could use shifter bushings, doesn't pop out of any
gear, newer clutch, has 73-79 nose, includes westy
bed, table, and jumpseat, only two or three dents.
White paint with green bumpers. Get the rust fixed and
the van painted and youd have a sweet paint. I need to
get $2000 for it, I think that is a good deal.
Located in Englewood, CO
Thanks,
Tyler
