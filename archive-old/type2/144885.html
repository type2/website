Not a bad idea, but nix the ratchet.  The captive nuts in the tin can't
take that much torque, which is probably why VW used cheeseheads in the
first place.

People who are bucks up might want to consider allen head screws, along
with the appropriate ball-head Allen driver.  Lets you put good torque on
the screw even if you are misaligned.
