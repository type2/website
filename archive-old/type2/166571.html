Subject: Re: [T2] Brakes pulling to the left on a '72

Hey, Barry, You and Andrew discovered the secret of brake pulling.... if it
pulls left, the problem is on the right side, if it pulls right the problem
is on the left side.  *Usually*  pulling means a leaky caliper/cylinder and
contaminated shoes/pads that brake ineffectively.  Plugged hoses result in
quick wear on the affected wheel's shoes/pads, but have little effect on
brakes when applied.  There may be a slight pull to the plugged side when
the brakes are not being applied (pads/shoes not retracting correctly).

As an aside, I am replacing pretty much the whole brake system on the '73.
I am up for inspection and did a preliminary look.  There had been no pull,
no &quot;B&quot; light, no nothing, but I wanted to check before I brought it in.

As it turns out, the right front and left rear wheels both had major
problems.  In addition, vacuum was down to ~10&quot; and capping the brake
booster raised it to 16&quot;.  As a result, I am installing new calipers, wheel
cylinders, pads, shoes, brake hoses, master cylinder, and vacuum booster.
All that's left of the original system will be the metal lines and brake
pedal.

If I finish the brakes early, I may be pulling the engine on the '69 to
install a new fan shroud.  I gotta get it past VA safety inspecion whch
means getting the defrost (heat) working.  This beast has J-tubes and a
buggered fan shroud as a legacy of its Cali past :-(

If you (or anyone else reading) want to help, drop on by, I'll be here all
day :-)

Steve
