Subject: Heater Cable Question

Hey Volks-
I am confused here. The heater cables on my bus are seized, and in need of
replacement. There are currently two cables: One with an &quot;L&quot; shaped bent in
the head that fits into the Temperature lever, and one with an eye in the head
that is bolted to the Heat/Defrost lever. Both run back to the flaps on the
heater boxes. It would seem to me that both of these cables should be on the
temperature lever so as to pull heat from both sides of the engine, and that
there should be a third cable that directs the warm air to either the defrost
or the floor connected to the Heat/Defrost lever. How is this supposed to be
set up? What am I missing here?
Cheers,
Matthew
