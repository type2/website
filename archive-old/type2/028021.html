Subject: Solid Light--don't flicker: Ballast Resistor?
Message-ID: &lt;HJDHAJDEDELDAAAA_at_theglobe_dot_com&gt;

Testing at my injector, I get a solid light when turning over the engine (it's not firing). Is that the ballast resistor or the ECU's fault? or something in between. The brain needs a signal from the dizzy to tell it when to apply voltage, right? Maybe I've got something wired wrong there?

And Sean, your description of Steve's problem is very close to my own. I keep thinking my ignition switch is worn out, but maybe it has something to do with wiring...or maybe that worn solenoid has some impact on the FI system...like maybe there's not enough voltage coming in to part of the FI system to trigger a critical event?

Thanks! Joe
