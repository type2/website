Subject: KYB Gas-a-justs shocks

Installed KYB GA's on the front.  It's been a few
years since I had a set on a bus.  With all the
recent comments from some folks about them being
too harsh, I wondered if my memory was failing
me.  This is my 3rd loaf bus with KYB's in the
last 20 years.  

Ride is nice and handling seems greatly improved.
 But, to be fair, the old oil shocks on my bus
were completely shot.  Those things look to have
been on the bus since the Age of Aquarius.  

I know these matters are entirely subjective and
I think it may depend on what you are used to. 
My grandfather drives an old Oldsmobile
stationwagon and just loves that soft ride. 
Feels like a boat to me (but it is impressively
utilitarian).  Personally, I've always driven
cars with firm rides, but yet I don't like the
rides of the slammed ghetto cruisers.  Those feel
like they don't have shocks at all to me.    

Any, I don't find the KYB's to be harsh at all. 
In fact, I wouldn't mind something a little more
firm.  

I'm sure the Koni's are nice, but I just wouldn't
want anything less firm than the KYB's and don't
wish to pay over $100 per shock.  I've heard the
Bilsteins are perhaps more firm?  Still pretty
pricey I bet.  

Next step, put the back shocks on tonight and
consider an oversized front sway bar in the
future.    

Happy bussin'
Ray
