Subject: Interior - '79 Westy

Yesterday I pulled a full set of milk chocolate brown curtains from a '79 
Mexico Beige westy.  All 10 curtains.

On the way home, I stopped at a laundromat and washed them.  All 10.  They 
came out nice, as well as they went in, but clean.  (The wife would not even 
let me near her washing machine,  I know.  )

Oh, yes, I also washed a mosquito net.  It, also, came out as well as it 
went in, nothing torn or anything.  It only freshened up the mosquito net 
(rear hatch) ; cause it was excellent to start with.

I got, BUT DID NOT WASH the two top cushions (bed) covers.  The bed had a 
matress cover, and sheets installed, so I doubt the PO abused it.  The 
covers are excellent, and I plan to cut them up and sell fabric for the 
front seats, so if anyone needs to redo their Mexico beige  front seats. I 
will be right back!!

Ok, so what.  Well, I may be going back for the rear seat, and I can look 
around for other '79 DELUXE items if you let me know ASAP.

The pop top canvas, I give it a rating of 9.8 on a 10 point scale.  It is 
solid, and HEAVY, not like my '78 canvas (which I rate at 9.2 because of the 
mosquito net and three pin holes up front.)

People (HSD, in particular) suggest puling the fiberglass top with the 
canvas still attached and just unscrewing the bottom screws.

This canvas is a prime candidate for this procedure.

I am not interested because I have enough projects and I an not anal about 
my '78 any more...

Contact me off line for location info.
