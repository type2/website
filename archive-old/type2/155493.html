Subject: Re: [T2] no start after lubing distrib. with WD40

&gt; You didn't know this????
&gt;


NO! I'll add a Turbonator too while I'm at it! 10 more horsepower! The ad
said so!

;-)

(And Mike, glad that's all it was.)

I've heard various takes on what to lubricate the advance mechanism and the
weights. Motor oil and dist grease were tops of the list. I used a light
smear of moly on everything, then wiped it off with my bare fingers so that
a very fine film was left. Worked great until my carbs went south on me.
Advance was smooth and quick. In fact that dist is in my hands right now
(the GWB got the 009 when I gave it away. heh...) and everything still moves
smoothly.

I really hate WD40 as a lube.
