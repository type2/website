So Mike West says:
&gt; 
&gt;  I have a FAQ on tools that I copped off the newsgroup.
&gt;  Written by Steve Johnson. Is he still around?

Hi Mike and all,

Yes I'm still around.  I was on vacation and had unsubscribed and had
to catch up on some work before I felt I could re-subscribe to the
list(s).  One important correction to Mikes remark about the author
of the 'Tools FAQ'.  That was NOT written by me, it was written by
James Brill jbrill_at_unlinfo.unl_dot_edu and deserves all the credit.  I
only deserve credit keeping the 'Air-cooled' FAQs administered and
posted.  Well, I have written an article or two in the other FAQs. 

Anyone else want the job?  Pretty please?  :)
