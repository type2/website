BINGO!

The 1970 Type 2 &quot;Owner's Manual&quot; and the 1970 &quot;Operating Instructions -
Campmobile 70&quot; that I scanned a couple of years ago are on this website.

I'd looked there when this thread came up again, but somehow missed them.  I
found them this time by searching the site for &quot;manuals&quot;.

The URL for the Owner's Manual is:

    http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/type2/literature/manuals/manuals70.htm

The URL for the [Campmobile] Operating Instructions is:

    http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/type2/literature/manuals/manuals70westy.htm

These were originally scanned at high resolution to retain detail and text
readability and saved as JPEGs.  The size of the image files, even
compressed as JPEGs, is pretty large and they are thus slow to transmit via
e-mail and correspondingly slow to download on the other end.

This website is chock full of air-cooled VW goodies, and Everett Barnes has
done our community a great service by providing it.  Many thanks, again,
Everett.....
