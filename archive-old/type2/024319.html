&gt; I'm also train buff and have followed many of the routes of the Denver and
&gt; Rio Grande Western from Alamosa to Durango and then up to Silverton so I
&gt; know those old back roads, and your right it is beautiful.
&gt; 
Does anyone have more favorite two lane highways next to railroads,
over the mountains? I have been thinking about this ever since I got my bus.

Since the railroads already have figured the most efficient way 
(fewest grades) then it would be real helpful to know for us busers. 

Thanks!
