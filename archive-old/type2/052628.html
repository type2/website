Surprise - the bus runs!

The motor came about 8 days ago. It only spent about 8 hours out of 
the bus but was treated to a head retorquing, carb rebuild , and an 
NOS exhaust. When all was said and done the bus ran but would not 
idle. Speculation about a botched carb rebuild or leaking intake 
manifold haunted me all night and into the next day. Whilst fiddling 
with it the next morning  I fried the points and condenser. After 
that Roy informed me that he found a small brass set screw in the 
warehouse in the spot where I had been rebuilding the carb. DOH! I 
left out the screw next to the pilot jet.

Later in the week I fussed with the motor some more but still no 
start. I decided to stop messing with spare condensers and bought a 
new one along with cap, rotor, more points, and a coil. Today I 
swapped in each part one at a time in hopes of finding the weak link. 
No deal. Bus would not start. Even pouring gas in the carb would not 
emit the faintest rumble from the motor. I was certain all along that 
it was an ignition issue but could not isolate it.

Then I heard the rumble of another bus coming down the Street. John 
pulled up in the '61 DC. I get the biggest kick outta seeing that in 
front of the house :) I updated him on all the failed attempts to 
isolate the problem. We went through the entire system double 
checking everything. We even got out the Bentley just to make sure. 
It was all good. I went up to turn the ignition while John manned the 
dizzy. I cranked and John turned the dizzy. The bus fired right up 
and idled at about 2000 rpm. I smiled and grabbed the timing light. 
Timing was advanced 90 DEGREES. WTF? No ping but it ran. We shut it 
down and began a long period of head scratching.

It did not make sense. It had all the markings of the distributor 
drive gear being in incorrectly. We studied the Bentley, looked at 
the motor in John's bus, scratched our heads some more and thought 
about pulling the gear and in reinstalling it. It just did not make 
sense. We decided to start over with static timing to 0 TDC.  I 
started up this time. We never could figure out what the heck 
happened.

We got the idle down to a reasonable figure but it was not steady. 
The manifold leak specter reared his ghastly head. Every time we 
touched the carb the idle would jump around. After playing with it 
some more with the air cleaner snorkel off  I realized the the choke 
flap was flopping around. I took the choke apart and redid it. That 
problem was solved but now it would not idle below 1200 RPM. A quick 
check of the carb to manifold bolts revealed a less than adequate 
torque value. Snugged those up and viola- smooth 850 RPM idle.

Thanks to John Stainkamp who volunteered so much of his time and 
expertise in helping me get the bus back on the road and for selling 
me the NOS exhuast for the same price he paid for it 5 years ago. 
Also thanks to Roy for the warehouse space to work on the bus and 
Chad for all the time he put in.

BTW, the 009/34pict3 is working very smoothly as it did before.
