Subject: Re: [T2] Using the Bus Depot part number search engine

This does not tell me why your search by part name
still does not work!!

Tell me where I went wrong when I used the name of the
part YOU listed by the part number you show when I do
a search by part number.
021256322B comes back as Heater Channel Cover Tin

Since the part does fit 72 to 79, I clicked on this
page : 
http://www.busdepot_dot_com/catalog.jsp?model=57
and typed Heater Channel Cover Tin in the search box.
I just tried it again and still I get 
Searched for: Heater Channel Cover Tin 
No items found. Please change your search criteria.

Where am I going wrong??

&gt; &gt; Ron's search works IF YOU KNOW the part

 does not work if you know the part name and search

 As an example, I searched for part  # 021256322B and
it came 
 back with the description of 'Heater Channel Cover
 Tin'. So I 
 went back to the main page, picked 72-79 bus, and
 then typed 
 Heater Channel Cover Tin in the 'Search all of the
 above 
 parts' box. The search came back: 'No items found.
 Please 
 change your search criteria'.........
 
 
&gt; It helps to understand how the BusDepot_dot_com search
 system works, in
 order to make the most of it. It is the largest VW
 parts database on the
 net, and is very powerful if you use it right.
 
 The search boxes on the main (white) pages are
 context sensitive. For
 example, if you click on &quot;72-79 bus&quot; and then use
 the search box, it
 will search only those parts that are listed as
 fitting that year range.
 If you click on &quot;72-79 bus&quot; and then &quot;clutch
 components,&quot; now the same
 search box will only search clutch parts for that
 year range. This
 context-sensitive search is probably the best place
 to start. As with
 any search engine, remember to try different
 wording, or even different
 categories. For example, a clutch cable might be
 listed under clutch
 parts and/or under cables; if you search under _all_
 '72-79 parts
 instead of just under clutch parts, you'll find it
 regardless.
 
 The search box on the left yellow menu bar, by
 comparison, is a global
 search that looks at the entire parts database -
 close to 200,000 parts
 - regardless of vehicle application, or even if we
 have no application
 data for that part at all.  This is the largest VW
 parts database on the
 web, and includes pretty much every Volkswagen part
 that was available
 at the time I assembled the database (some of which
 may have been
 discontinued since then, unfortunately). You may
 find the part this way
 even if you couldn't using the context-sensitive
 search.  Most likely
 because we do list the part, but do not have
 application data entered
 for it (so it is not coming up in the
 context-sensitive search). This
 was the case in the example that you cited.
 Incidentally, although not
 mentioned on the website, that box will also search
 by keyword, but this
 is of limited use since it doesn't filter by vehicle
 application (for
 example it brings up about 250 results for keyword
 &quot;muffler.&quot;)  It will
 also search many Bosch part numbers and even many
 Rocky Mountain
 Motorworks and West Coast Metric numbers. (Although
 in the latter case
 we may have the part cheaper under an alternate
 number).
 
 The reason I suggest trying the context-sensitive
 keyword search first
 is that it can be more useful. First of all, even if
 you have a part
 number, that number may have been superceded. A
 keyword search could
 bring up the new superceded number, or even an
 alternate part number
 that does the same job for less money (i.e. the same
 part under a Bosch
 number rather than a VW number), whereas a search
 for a specific part
 number will only look for the exact number string
 that you entered. But
 on the other hand, if the keyword search doesn't net
 you a result, the
 global search might. If both fail, then you've just
 struck out after
 searching 200,000 parts. Maybe the part was
 discontinued or superceded
 to a new number.
