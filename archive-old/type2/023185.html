&gt;No physical problem running any number of shims, but you have to ask why
&gt;the play has opened up so much that you need to add a 4th shim.  Is the
&gt;wear on the aft side of the thrust surface or the forward side?  If it is
&gt;on the forward side, you will be forcing the crankshaft to run further aft
&gt;than it was designed to do, perhaps causing misalignment to the other
&gt;bearings.

A 4th shim to get to the desired endplay might not be a problem, 
especially if it's only to make up for not having one or more of 
the thicker sizes at hand. Something Bob Hoover shared with us is 
that he recorded more wear when using less than three shims. 

I would not re-use old shims because, like George said, they 
do not wear evenly, only 'the middle shim' might have worn 
evenly, and the other ones have been riding against either a 
flywheel or a bearing, even running them in the same location/
position but using a different bearing and flywheel might still 
cause them to not distribute thrust properly.

The shims are available from VW and Porsche, at least they are 
here (Holland) for about $3 each. VW parts are typically much 
cheaper at Porsche, though the price difference for the shims 
is not much.

021 105 281 : 0.30mm
021 105 283 : 0.32mm
021 105 285 : 0.34mm
021 105 287 : 0.36mm
021 105 289 : 0.38mm
021 105 291 : 0.24mm

Last time I checked the .38 and .24 were NLA if I recall 
correctly. These numbers are used by both VW and Porsche.

Apart from the thickness, there are basically three types 
of shims that VW used in the aircooled engines. One for 
all 6V non O-ring cranks and flywheel combinations, then 
the 12V with O-ring type, and the Type-4. (I might be 
forgetting the 25/36 Hp engines here) They all have 
different inside diameters. The 6V shims are hard to 
come by, I got the last two Berg had in stock, earlier 
this year. I almost tried some repro parts but quality 
was almost frightening.

I would not use paper in the shimstack. 

I've tried to locate shims in the proper sizes through 
a local specialist shop, but they found that no 'standard' 
shim had the same dimensions as the VW ones.

Another thing I noticed with original VW/Porsche shims 
is that the inside and outside diameters are not always 
centered. I don't think that is a problem.

Hope it helps, 

Brian
