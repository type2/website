Subject: Refrigerator Repair 75 Deluxe?

I have decided to bite the bullet and have my refrigerator looked at by the
local RV place.  The guy said he would take a look at for free and had
worked with Dometic before.  Has anyone actually had one repaired, and
how much were the costs?  I know these refrigerators don't keep
running that long after stopping  but I would like to get it to work. 
Especially for quick outings, tailgates, and so on.  Plus for those rare
occasions of having a plug in at the campsitet.  Its funny, I got a bonus at
work and the dough went out my pocket for heater box and muffler. 
Now my birthday is Sunday,(whopping 27) and the funds that have
rolled in from my sisters will hopefully bring on refrigeration.  Easy come,
Easy go.  H. Steve if your reading I'll ask if a conversion exists to turn it
into propane fridge.

Have a wonderful weekend everyone
