Subject: Re: [T2] Whistling Bus - The new guy finally fixed his own bus

The whistling was the vacuum line going to the brake booster, it was on top of the nipple on the intake and setting against the intake so when you looked down it appeared to still be in place, the shiny nipple was hidden beneath the hose.

Whisty the Westy?  Too cheesy?


&gt; So where was the whistling coming from? 
&gt; 
&gt; btw, if you haven't already named your bus, you know you gotta name it 
&gt; whistler or something like that - it's just too appropriate ;)
