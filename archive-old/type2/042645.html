Tony ,
Check out the RPD 435 &amp; RPD 435X by BLAUPUNKT--Bosch Group....It's a
High-Power fm/am/CD receiver with detachable face.  I had to cut out a
little( where my original radio opening was) to fit it into my 71 but, it
fit's, looks, and sounds great. About $100  at Costco in so cal.  speakers
optional.

well.............

&gt; hey folks,
&gt;
&gt; gonna be upgrading the stereo in the '78 rustfalia and i could use some
&gt; suggestions on speaker placement. i already have some speakers i'd like to
&gt; use. i have two decent 6X9's, and 4 decent round (mebbe 4 or 5&quot;) speakers.
&gt; two of the round speakers had already been mounted in the front door
panels
&gt; by some po. i was thinking of mounting the 6X9's in the rear hatch panel.
&gt; i'm not looking to spend alot. mebbe $300 or so for a stereo and cd
changer.
&gt; so, any tips?
&gt;
&gt; thanks!
&gt;
&gt; tony
