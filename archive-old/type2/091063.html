... Karl,
&gt; Thanks for the picture of the early bay Westy handle for the sliding
&gt; door (double ended). Now, here's the tricky part...does anyone know
&gt; where one is available?
&gt; A not-so-careful &quot;friend&quot; has broken mine into bits.
&gt; I have called VW salvage yards that I know of and cannot find a
&gt; replacement at all.
&gt; Thanks for any leads.
