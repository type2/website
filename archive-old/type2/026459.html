After having read the various musings of the other listees who attended
Josh's funeral on Friday, I feel I don't have much to add.  The funeral was
as nice a one as a fellow could want - filled with lots and lots of friends
and family.  What I will comment on is how I met Josh and why I drove 650
miles to bid final farewell to someone I had only spent a few days (or was
it a lifetime) with.

I met Josh only once about 2 years ago when he and his wife took a trip
through S. Texas because he wanted to see South Padre Island.  He posted to
the list, asking for any cool roads, sights, or VW bone yards to visit along
the way.  I wrote back and, although I had never met the guy, offered to
have them stay with my wife and I in San Antonio if they wanted.  After
writing back and forth a few times, we had it all worked out.  

I was a little nervous since I had never met them and didn't really know
what to expect.  But from the moment they pulled into the driveway and came
inside, I knew I had made a good decision.  Within 30 minutes, we were
talking and laughing and having fun like we had known each other all our
lives.  We did a few touristy things with them while they were here -
Riverwalk, Sea World, etc.  (In fact, there was a picture of Josh's bus in
front of the Sea World sign in the slideshow at the funeral.  I was doing OK
until I saw that one, then I really lost it for a bit.)

By the time they left on Sat or Sunday, I had made a lifetime friend.  I was
hoping they'd come back through on their return trip, but the clutch in his
69 bus went out while at Padre and they cut their trip short, driving the
straightest route back home.  I've stayed in touch with Josh on and off the
list ever since, sharing good-natured ribbing and serious 'buscussions'.  

When I read the first post about Josh's passing, the strangest feeling came
over me.  I felt like I was standing at the edge of a huge canyon with
blackness all around me and the bottom spiraling towards me.  I got cold and
sweaty at the same time and kept thinking over and over, &quot;This has to be a
joke.  No one would joke about this.  This has to be a joke.........&quot;

But the reality finally soaked in.  I thought about it and thought about it
and couldn't make any sense of it.  I finally decided I had to go there in
person.  I wanted to meet more people who knew Josh.  People who could tell
me more about him and maybe help make some sense out of the tragedy.

What I found at the funeral and then at the wake that evening was a huge
number of people, young and old, that were there for essentially the same
reason.  But there were no answers.  There seldom are in these things I
guess.  What there was was a strong sense of love, loss, and compassion.
Josh had affected a lot of people's lives in various ways.  His friends are
better for having known him and we're all poorer for his passing.

I was a little nervous that I might feel like an outsider amongst his close
friends and family.  That maybe they would hate anything having to do with
buses or the list for some reason.  But apparently Josh's gift for making
strangers feel like family had rubbed off on all of them.  I made some new
friends there and got to meet some more listees face-to-face.

Everyone I talked to seemed touched that several of us bus-folks had come to
pay our respects.  Many of his friends were quite surprised at how many
people knew Josh and how many people were lamenting his loss.  Death is not
a pleasant thing and tragic deaths like this one are the worst.  But time
will heel the wounds and soften the memories and a part of Josh will live on
with each of us.

Rest in peace Josh and may God watch over your soul for eternity.
