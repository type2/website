Subject: Re: Progressive carb on `77 BUS

I know lots'o folks on the list have had bad luck or just plain hate the
Weber Progressive setup.

Not me! I ran one on my '77 Westy for 4 years without a problem. Power and
mileage were very close to what I got with FI. There may be different
versions of the carb because some people suggest that there is not place to
hook up a vac dizzy hose. I ran mine with the stock dizzy without any
issues. Don't use a 009 on a 2L engine - it does NOT give enough advance.
The installation took about 2 hours and away I went. Installation on an FI
bus is quite simple because the throttle cable already comes out right where
you want it. The only Rube-Goldberg in my setup was an extension I added to
the throttle cable to reach the carb. I don't know what jet sizes I was
using - whatever came installed in the carb - I believe it came with a set
of high altitude jets as well.

Cold weather may cause carb icing - there is no heat riser. This could be a
big issue. I only run my bus in the 'better' half of the year so it was not
an issue with me.

I've since put FI back on my bus and of course I love the drivability vs. a
carb. But the Weber worked great for me for 4 years. There - that's my 2
cents worth. Good Luck!

'77 Westy with resurrected FI.

&gt;Hello, I just picked up a very nive `77 westfalia.
&gt;The fuel injection is dead.  Came with a new
&gt;Progressive weber carb kit new in the box.  I have it
&gt;on the van and ready to go.
