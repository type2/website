&gt; Hello, and seasons greetings!!

&gt; Q1:  Will a '79 bay's caliper and rotor fit on a '72 spindle?  I. e., can I
&gt; simply swap out a '72 caliper/rotor with that from a '79.

No.  '71 and '72s had the thinner calipers and spindles to match.  '73
and up had the fatter calipers and spindles to match.  You can't mix
these (yes, I've tried!)

&gt; Q2:  If not, how far back must I extract from the '79 to fit the system,
&gt; bolt on, to a '72??

Spindles out.  Break them loose from the ball joints
