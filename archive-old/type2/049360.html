Subject: [T2] Hydraulic lock rocks! + Champagne Westy in Nova?

My 914 had a problem with hydraulic lock.  Some crud
fouled a float or a jet or something and my #1 and #2
cylinders kept filling up with gas.  The first time it
happened I had installed a new battery and hit the key
and all I got was a loud, expensive sounding &quot;chunk!&quot;.
 Being the master-mechanic that I am I promptly threw
the battery on a charger and tried again and got the
same result.  Since I am an extremely skilled
master-mechanic I tried push-starting the car with two
guys helping me and didn't get a chunk! just a long
skid.  Then for some reason I decided to pull the
dipstick...hey, that's not oil!  I pulled all the
plugs and we pushed it in gear for about 5 feet and
narrowly avoided a gas bath when the #2 piston came up
and shot gas all over the place.  After letting most
of the gas evaporate I reinserted the plugs and
cranked the engine over and it started fine.  It also
blew a bunch of gas out the tailpipe.  I warmed the
engine up a tad and then changed the extremely diluted
oil.  Hopefully there won't be any long-term
effects...

To the person that sighted the Champagne edition Westy
on Rt. 7 last week:  I felt a small swelling of pride
when I read your email because I thought you might
have been talking about my Champagne edition Westy but
then I realized you were probably talking about the
really, really, really cherry Westy that I always see
at the Bradlee Safeway.  Oh well, maybe after a paint
job.
