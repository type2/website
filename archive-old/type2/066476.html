Subject: Re: how many miles on your bus

does this mean that you think the engine lasts from 50-60,000 miles
A guy in the parking lot hre has a 70 bus that is over 300,000 miles that he
bought from new.
He said that things were better when there was a 55 mph speed limit.
THis meant that he really cruised with the traffic at 60 mph and did not
stress the engine.

How fast do you drive?
