Subject: [T2] Central Florida Vdubb gathering tonight.

Reminder that at 6 PM tonight, new Deland/Orange City club will meet at 
Walmart parking lot; where US 17 and Us 92 (International Speedway) split.

Unless SO gets back in time, from NC, with the SC, I'll have to miss it, as 
I'm sure not going to show up in her new/old Suburax Brat..:(.

Daytona has a very active club whose next meeting is 7 Feb. I'll post closer 
to the event..and see you there..

temporary 71 camper....and now a 79 Suburx Brat...mit wasserboxer...:(
