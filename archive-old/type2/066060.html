Subject: Where should I buy a rebuilt 1600 dual-port engine?

Can anyone on the list give me a suggestion as to where to buy a rebuilt
1600 dual-port engine? I've got a '71 Westfalia, but a previous owner
modified the rear engine hanger, so it now only fits on a bug engine.

I had planned on getting a GEX engine, but some postings here have
suggested that's not such a good idea.

If anyone can suggest a place in the Seattle area, that would be great,
but suggestions on mail-order places would help a lot too.

thanks,
Tom
