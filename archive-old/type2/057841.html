&lt;&lt; .I am looking for a source of main jets for stock VW Solex carbs.
 My local VW shop and other assorted VW shops I have contacted cannot get
 them for me...I was going to try BERG in the morning but thought I would
 ask listees if they know of a place before I waste a long distance call
 to BERG being put on hold for 20 minutes before they can tell me no they
 don't have them.
 
 Thanks. Todd S &gt;&gt;


   You all may find this very hard to believe but several years ago while
looking to rejet a solex I was told that either suzuki or yamaha used the same
exact main jets in the carbs on there bikes.I went down to the local dealer
and sure enough found them to be an exact match,picked up several different
sizes and went home.
It was hard to believe that a motorcycle used some of the same sized jets as
my bus.
