Subj:    Brake shoes for &quot;71&quot; camper

I am putting all new brakes on my camper and have been inquiring about parts
for some time now from different places. For the first time a parts store guy
has told me that there are two different types  so I have to give him the
chasis #. How come other  parts places like bus boys or VW Bus heaven did not
know or just did not tell me? Does anyone know for sure?
