I must say I feel a bit protective of H Steven Dolan (the list admin.),
he has done a GREAT job of managing the list.  While it would be great
if their was not a need to occasionally kill a particular thread, there
is.  The list has improved greatly over the past year or so, for those
who are newer to the list there was a period when it was hard to find
any technical discussion at all.  There was so much arguing going on, as
well as non topic matter.  Friday however is the day to post sightings,
and various side talk.  I really enjoy this list and have learned so
much from everyone on here.  Thank you H Steven Dolan!
