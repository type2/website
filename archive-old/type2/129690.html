Hi Mark,

You've got to remove **ALL** the fuel lines to get the tank out. I did 
it that way once, and it was a HUGE pita to get the filler pipe hooked 
up properly. The last time this job came up I took the short cut and 
hacked a hole in the rear deck. The next bay I see being parted will 
become a donor for the hatch metal to cover the hole, but in the 
meanwhile it's sealed over and no-one can see it under the westy 
cushion anyway.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Does this mean that, from your experience, it is possible to replace 
&gt; the sender simply by tipping the tank out -- and not removing it 
&gt; completely? You could, for instance, leave the fuel lines connected?
