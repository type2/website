Subject: Re: [T2] what i love/hate about bus ownership

What I hate about my bus:

1)Always wants to break down when I am getting ready to leave for a trip
2)hoping it doesn't break down on my trip
3)when a group of girls going by wave they are 16
4) when a group of women my age go by they think I am 16
5) being nervous about cops, even though I am 100% legal
6) knowing I have learned enough that when I break down I have to have the
bus towed to my house so I can work on it instead of a shop like everybody
else
7) squatting to do most of the work on the engine in my 72
8) only 1 place in town to buy parts and they are expensive

Things I like about my bus:
1) the sound of the sliding door
2) its a rolling hotel room
3) other bus people who wave
4) &quot;I used to have one of those&quot;
5) &quot;when we get to the top of the hill do you want to check your water?&quot;
hehe
6) knowing I have learned enough that when I break down I have to have the
bus towed to my house so I can work on it instead of a shop like everybody
else
7) the list of course
8) and the campouts... like Sunshine Daydream
