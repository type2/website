&gt; But when I got over there, the porsche FI system did not have the same

It's the same D-Jet system that the Type III VWs used.
 
&gt; So I am starting to wonder if I am going to be able to figure out how to set
&gt; this up and get it running in my bus. Any comments or suggestions?

Harder to keep running than L-Jet in my opinion but certainly doable.
Personally I would convert it to L-Jet and benefit from all the help because
you'll be going it along with D-Jet or lucking on the 914 forums for help.
 
&gt; Oh... he also told me to expect more horsepower with this motor, but it has
&gt; the 4 stud intakes, and others have told me this motor is not any different
&gt; from a VW motor except for the oil spout.

Slight difference in piston design, combustion chamber, compression ratio,
valves, higher rpm etc lead to different HP numbers.

Buses using these donor engines need torque. That's the number to look at.
