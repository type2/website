Subject: Re: Reliability of Busses (sic)

Per Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary:

bus n, pl buses or busses often attrib [short for omnibus[ (1832)

They're both right, and predominant usage varies depending upon which
side of &quot;The Pond&quot; you're on.

&gt; As most of us were taught in 8th grade English (but some have evidently
&gt; forgotten), the plural of &quot;bus&quot; is &quot;buses.&quot; It's one of those spelling
&gt; exceptions.
