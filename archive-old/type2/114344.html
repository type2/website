Subject: Re: [T2] On removing clothes closet from Westfalia, what the
  trick?

Roland,

    I believe there are screws at the top. Have you taken out the &quot;plywood&quot; 
headliner
just forward of the rear hatch?

I don't have a westy, per say, but have been looking at taking various parts 
from junkers to put into my bus. Try looking up along the side with the cubby 
holes.
You'll need to peak your head inside the closet.
