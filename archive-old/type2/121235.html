Subject: Buying rebuilt engine

So far I havent seen any posts about anyone getting a bad rebuilt engine 
from bus depot, so I think I'm going to buy one for my 80 vanagon. If 
anyone has anything positive or negative to say about these engines 
please let me know.

Also If you have a list of the additional parts needed for installing 
the engine I would apreciate it. I am wondering about parts like the 
pushrod tube seals etc.

Thanks
tom
