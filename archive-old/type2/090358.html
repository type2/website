Subject: WTB: FI Fuel Pressure Regulator

All this talk about the FI fuel pressure regulator has got me thinking...  I'm 
running d-Jet FI on my 73 (with 914 2.0 motor).  The d-Jet system does not use 
a variable-pressure regulator.  It uses a fixed on that you set and it remains 
constant (spec says 28.5, but I run 29.5 on both my bus and my 914).  But what 
I figure is I could use the variable-pressure regulator from an L-Jet system to 
give me a little more pressure at WOT and have less pressure at idle.  Should 
help with emissions, should give me a cleaner idle, should help with 
performance.

So, does anyone have a spare fuel pressure regulator laying around that they'd 
sell me?  Bus Depot sells them new for $59.95, but since this is experimental I 
was hoping to find a used one for a lot less.

Thanks.
