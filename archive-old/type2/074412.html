Subject: Re: [T2] Loose fan hub 80 Vanagon

Hi Kahndeed,

Same thing happened to my 1800cc 73 engine this past summer, except I pul=
led
over very soon after the light came on. I have no heat gauges, so I have =
no
idea how hot it was. In my case you could hear the fan squealing as it
rubbed against the timing mark metal, which was completely destroyed.

Also different in my case was that the bot had broken off, and we had to
drop the engine and drill out the remains. Major PITA.

I reassembled with lots of red loctite on the bolt and between the crank =
and
the flange to ensure this wouldn't happen again.

The new owner of that engine doesn't expect to get much use out of the
crank.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Hi,
&gt; I was driving along and the alternator light went on and the voltage ga=

&gt; showed 10 volts. I thought it would be OK as I didn't need lights or an=
ything.
&gt; Then smoke started coming in the van. I stopped and smoke was even blow=
ing
&gt; out the air intake vents. I looked at the engine and it didn't seem hot=
,
&gt; plenty of oil, then the smoke went away and I thought I could make it. =
(Must
&gt; be oil on the exhaust, I thought) A mile further I saw the cylinder tem=

&gt; pegged  600 degrees and oil tempeture 350 degrees.
&gt;
&gt; After a 95 dollar tow job, I tried to find out what it was, the engine =
ran
&gt; well
&gt; but the fan wasn't turning. The center bolt had gotten loose and the hu=
b key
&gt; was
&gt; sheared. The hub had to be replaced but the crank was OK.
&gt;
&gt; I am soooo lucky I didn't burn the engine up. How did those heads survi=
ve 600
&gt; degrees and not lose the valve seats?
&gt;
&gt; Moral to the story, if the alternator light goes on, stop and check it =
out.
