Subject: Re: [T2] .009, There MUST be some advantages

I want to add something that I find interesting.

we sell a modified distributor we term the SVDA, it has a 009 centrifugal
curve, with the addition of vacuum advance. The vac pots are used, and
occasionally develop a hole or leak, rendering the vacuum advance
inoperable. The timing specs for the 009 and our SVDA are identical.

It's humorous the mail I get when one of the vacuum cans destructs like
this, comments like &quot;it runs like shite without that vacuum can&quot;, or
something similar. I send them a new can, and point out that with an
inoperable vacuum advance, they have a 009 advance curve.

So, unless you have compared an SVDA to a 009, there is no basis for
&quot;comparison&quot;.

The 009 is inexpensive, and available new. The 009 proponents will claim
it's superiority to vac advance distributors, why didn't VW supply them on
their beetles and busses, especially since it was so much less $ ? VBG

&gt; &gt;Did I mention that most [hush tim, I said most! :)] mechanics are
clueless
&gt; &gt;about advance curves and how they relate to the combustion process?
&gt; &gt;Perhaps there is a reason that VW NEVER EVER EVER put a [currently
common]
&gt; &gt;009 on a typ1, typ3, or typ4 engine?
&gt;
&gt; The best value of an 009 is it only wastes $50 or so to get by until you
&gt; find a better curved dizzy. This does not include the T-IV motor. It's
dead
&gt; wrong and cannot in any way meet specs.
&gt;
&gt; I have verified curves on a number of 009's and have found in the cases
&gt; where they were not worn they all hit within a degree or two of 25° total
&gt; range. The 009 is shown by Bosch as a suitable replacement for some VW
&gt; engines, but not the T-IV in any case.
&gt;
&gt; Standard procedure when first installing and running any new or used dizzy
&gt; is verifying the curve with a tack and timing light. Plot the advance/rpm
&gt; every 500 rpm up to total advance. Compare your curve with stock. If you
&gt; are within the stock curve min-max area at all rpm's, you can use it and
&gt; expect suitable function. If not, find a better fit ASAP.
