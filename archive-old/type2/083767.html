Subject: Re: [T2] let me try to type slower

Dan,

You need to remove the CV to get the boot off, yes.  If you don't have
one, head on down to Sears and get a set of Lock Ring Pliers (Item #
00947386000)  This will really help with the retaining ring on the end of
the shaft.

There is a theoretic difference between the inner and outer face of a CV.
I believe it is that the raised lip on the inner hub, the bevel on the
cage, and the groove on the outer go toward the center of the axle.
OTOH, I have mismatched them without ill effect.  If you are trying to
&quot;flip&quot; them to bring a new wear surface into action, they are important
alignment marks, other than that I hardly pay attention, but I'd love to
learn if this is wrong.
