Subject: Re: [T2] Type 1 engine oil pump removal

You don't have to split the case, maybe to really investigate that knock 
though. Take a piece of steel rod about 2&quot; long 1/4&quot; - 3/8&quot; in Diameter and 
tack weld it on to a piece of all thread in the shape of a T. The leg of the 
T should be the all thread. Find something to create a U shaped channel that 
will fit over the iol pump and rest on the case 2x4 will work fine if you 
have the room. Drill a hole in the top of the U to accomomdate the all 
thread. Insert the steel rod into the pump the all thread into the U add a 
large flat washer and a nut to fit the all thread. Tighten....
