Subject: RE: [T2] Drum brake star adjuster

&gt;I have been trying to take out the drum brake star adjusters without any
&gt;success, I do not want to damage anything, are there any trick to do this
&gt;job or just brutal force?

Hi Roberto,

The stars themselves are soft brass, so they will get chewed up by 
vise-grips and brute force.  My backing plate plugs were missing, so my 
adjusting stars were pretty rusty.  I put a load of Liquid Wrench on the 
stars, let them soak for a while, and hit the assembly with a torch.  Once 
the carrier for the stars was red-hot, I put some pliers on the stars and 
they twisted right out.  Put a lot of grease on them when you put them back, 
and be sure to replace your backing plate plugs if they're missing -- they 
keep out water and keep your stars from rusting.

Good Luck!
