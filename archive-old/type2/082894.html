Subject: Re: [T2] Upcoming trip

Dave, 
I apologize for the time discrepency, The last time I
made that Drive it was in a 65 Kombi that my friend
and I picked up in Deckers which was running on three
cylinders, no working gas gauge, only one headlight,
at 5:00 in the morning, good thing my friend only paid
$200 dollars for this bus. Time really wasn't on my
mind on that trip.
Thanks,
Tyler

&gt; Tyler, if you can make Colorado Springs from
&gt; Woodland Park in 10 mins, you 
&gt; aren't driving a bus... in fact you aren't driving
&gt; at all, you are flying a 
&gt; jet...hehehe.....  Having been that route many times
&gt; in the more than 10 
&gt; years of living here in the Springs, I can tell you
&gt; that it will take roughly 
&gt; 45 mins.  If you bust the speed limit, aren't in a
&gt; bus, and the traffic is 
&gt; very light... maybe 30 mins.  I think it took me
&gt; about 50 mins from Rocky 
&gt; Mountian Motor Works to the city limits in my '71,
&gt; about the same time in our 
&gt; '78.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for the smile to start the day.  I agree that
&gt; the trip from Denver to 
&gt; the Springs on the Interstate is pretty dull. 
&gt; Kicking over to 83 at Arapahoe 
&gt; Rd. (to Parker) and then coming down is much
&gt; prettier, and you can pull into 
&gt; Cottonwood Canyon State Park  (I think that is the
&gt; name, only State park on 
&gt; the way to the Springs).... now that is a very nice
&gt; place to visit...worth 
&gt; the entrance fee.  Sort of a mini-Grand Canyon.
