Going on our first long road trip to SoCal from the Bay Area for the
4th of July weekend in Speedy, so being the prepared bus pilot I try
to be I ordered some spare parts.  Having seen John Connolly's previous
posts here, I thought I'd try it out.  I ordered a few consumables, new
rubber for the engine compartment, etc.  Man, everything was perfect.
 The shipment arrived slightly early (which gives me the weekend to install
parts) and my wife didn't jump down my throat about going to the VW shop
for parts (the credit card bill comes much later).

A definite and earnest thanks.  Maybe next go 'round I'll try Bus Depot...

BTW, any pointers/tips for me?  Do I need to give Speedy a break every
now and then?  It's only 6 hours on I-5 in the wife's car, so I would
assume it should take me an hour or two longer in Speedy.

Thanks,

Simon Ramirez Jr.
