Subject: Re: [T2] Dyno test

Don't forget that the hp spec quoted in the Bentley manual is at the
crankshaft while the hp measurement you get from a dyno is at the wheels.
Figure on roughly a 15% reduction in hp between the crankshaft and the
wheels due to driveline losses.

Also, there are many other factors that will influence power such as ambient
temperature, humidity, ignition timing, fuel/air mixture, etc. etc. etc.

&gt; They had a dyno day in town, so I had our 76 2000cc FI checked just for
heck
&gt; of it.
&gt; The graph print out shows 54HP at 4200RPM and 71 ft-lbs of torque at
3000RPM
&gt; at the rear wheels.
&gt; The Bentley shows the GD engine to develop 67HP at 4200RPM and 101.0
ft-lbs
&gt; of torque at 3000RPM.
&gt; Are these numbers acceptable for a rebuilt engine with 30,000 miles on it?
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Bucket
