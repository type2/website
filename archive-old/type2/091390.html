Subject: Quick Shift Kit

I have a 1976 Type2.  I bought a quick shift kit for
it and I can't figure it out.  It came with the big
elevator piece two bolts and a plastic thing.  Where
does the plastic thing go? It fits into the place
where the ball used to go but then were does the ball
go? Do I have to modifie my shifter lever in any way.

Detailed instructions would be apreiciated.

Thanks
Matthew Neadow
