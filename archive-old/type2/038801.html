|Anyone from around Annapolis or the Delmarva peninsula planning to go
|to this show??  Could I hitch a ride with you??
|
|I've got trans problems (non-Vanagon).  Could probably get to your
|house.......  It's just that until I can get the problem fixed, my
|regular wheels are not suitable for a trip on Interstates and
|beltways.
|
|Thanks
