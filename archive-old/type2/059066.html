Subject: Re: Hints for buying a bus unseen

&gt; Has anyone bought a bus without seeing it? Any tips on how to
&gt; handle the transaction as far as money and title or checking out the vehicle
&gt; are concerned.

 Before you travel send the seller a disposable camera and
get them to take pictures from every angle.
 If you send an SAE to mail it back they can hardly object and
you will get a much more accurate idea of the real
state of the bus.
 If you want to see the interior/engine bay a flash equipped model would be handy.

Cheers,
              W.
