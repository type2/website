Subject: Re: removing alternator on 1600 engine?

I worked a VW shop for a few years, and we would always pull the
alternator with the engine in the bus.

Yes , that's on a 1600.  We only worked on upright engines, no pancakes
at all.

The only time we had to pull the engine is if the fan nut wouldn't break
loose.  

Maybe we were doing it wrong, but it always worked, and I've done it on
my own bus.  You just have to get  up in the engine compartment with your
engine.  

Just a thought,
