Subject: cv bolt removal tips

Can't get at all the cv bolts?
Get the wheel off the ground by getting the bus axle tube or side body
tube on a good jackstand.  Then you can rotate the wheel to get the cv
bolt into position for removal.  The hanging wheel puts enough angle on
the axle so it's out of the way of the lower positioned bolt.\ Spraying
with penetrant or using heat is iffy because the threads are way inside
past the full width of the joint! Clean the hex hole carefully; blow it
out with compressed air or use a water pic filled with hot water to
blast the hole clean.  I use a 6mm allen socket that you put on a socket
wrench, but also have used an unbunged 6mm bent wrench with and
extension made from 3/8&quot; pipe.  With the socket head you can tap on the
socket itself with a small sledge to shock the hidden threads.  Keep the
head square in the socket  as you apply torque.  If you have a sliding
handle for the socket, you can tap on it with  the hammer as you apply
torque.
   If all fails (you bunged the hole) try a vise grip on the head.  Get
a dremyl tool with a FIBER cutting disk and slice off the head as a last
resort.

&gt; 
&gt; &quot;doh!&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; ok, I didn't actually have a 6mm, but my roommate gave me my late xmas
&gt; present after i told him what i was working on and wouldnt you know, it was
&gt; a tool kit and had one in it.
&gt; 
&gt; sweet, but on to the next part...
&gt; 
&gt; needless to say, im in a little over my head, not in terms of how do I get
&gt; these hex nuts off or which order to do them in, but on the one most easily
&gt; accessable to me where it meets the tranny ive cleaned them up, soaked in
&gt; liquid wrench, tapped a bit to try and loosen em up a little, yet can't seem
&gt; to get it to even move a tiny hair...
&gt; 
&gt; im thinking to myself, what happens when I get to those top nuts where you
&gt; have little to no room to even get your hands in there, how in whomevers
&gt; name am I to turn those, when those that are so easily navigated around I
&gt; cannot budge....  im a big guy, and can usually muscle whatever I need to
&gt; when the need arises, but sheesh! any tips in this department?
&gt; 
&gt; that little hex tool is the right fit, but I am having a heck of a time
&gt; gettin er to turn....
&gt; 
&gt; would how I have the bus jacked up off of the ground have any bearing on
&gt; this? If i jack it up too high or not high enough, would that in any way put
&gt; more or less pressure on these nuts, making it any easier or harder?
&gt; 
&gt; currently I just have it up enough to crawl under, so while the tire is
&gt; lifted a little, it still makes contact with the ground....
&gt; 
&gt; I really would like to take care of this myself, but if push came to shove I
&gt; guess I could take it elsewhere.. id just hate to quit at this stage..
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks again for any tips, tricks, etc....
