Subject: Re: [T2]Reactions of dirty oil breather

Yes, this is true. It is especially problematic if you have the later
type with a PCV valve in it. I replaced mine with an earlier model
that is the free flowing type. Even then, my mechanic said the nipple
at the air cleaner was too contrictive, and that I would experience
less oil leakage caused by crankcase pressure if I would just take the
hose from the breather and hang it from somewhere up high in the
engine compartment. This actually helped. In my case it was mostly due
to blowby from a worn engine. Since yours is newly rebuilt, you may
experience blowby until your engine is broken in.
