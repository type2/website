Subject: Re: Exhaust Wrap Good Idea?

Derrick,

This sounds like the stuff that G Matthew Bulley mentions in his Heat, Rust, and
Noise article that I read recently. In addition to keeping the air temp down it
has, according to GMB, the added benefits of cleaner emmissions, more heat for
your heat exchangers, and better engine performance. Best you hear it all from
the horses mouth...

or find it in the type2 library.

&gt;  Hello everyone!

&gt;  Im sure everyone here reads the new RMMW catalog cover to cover as soon
&gt;  as a new one arrives, even though they know that its going to be exactly
&gt;  the same as the one you got a week ago.  Anyway, I was flipping through
&gt;  one the other day and noticed something new.  The now sell this tape- like
&gt;  insulating wra  that covers your heater boses and header.  The idea    that
&gt;  it will keep the heat inside your exhaust system until it gets kicked
&gt;  the tail pipe.  They claim that using this stuff can lower the air temp
&gt;  in your engine compartment by up to 70 percent.  Im all for lower air
&gt;  temps, and no this is not a quick fix for a hot running engine.  My westy
&gt;  is comming home from the restoration shop soon and Ill be putting the
&gt;  engine back in right after.  I have brand new, German heater boxes and
&gt;  a new SandS single quiet pack and header, all of which Ive sandblasted and
&gt;  recoated with por15 high temp paint.
&gt;
&gt;  Do you guys think this wrap is a good idea?
