Importance: Normal
Subject: EGR Filter

Hi People,

I'm almost ready to drop my 2.0 L FI motor out of my 77 Westy.  I'm removing
all the exhaust components so as to clean them up and replace the
nuts/bolts, which look original.  When I removed the EGR filter, a ton of
rust poured out!  What's really strange is that this EGR filter is only few
months old.  The original one was rusted clean through, and the PO had
blocked the EGR line from the filter.  Since I'm in California, I tried to
put the system back to spec. with a new filter. My questions...

1.  Is it normal for the EGR filter to be full of rusty particles?

2.  If my after-market EGR filter is really crapola, what are the
ramifications of putting everything back and re-blocking the EGR line (I
don't want rust in the new rebuilt I'm going to install, and probably can't
afford an OEM EGR filter)?


Thanks,
RickG
