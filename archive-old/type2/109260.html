Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Jalousie seals

Hey Richard, no I havn't had the chance to get to the Jalousie's yet. Been
to busy trying to track down the damn exhaust leak. Why do you ask? Are you
having difficulties with something? Its not something I'm looking forward to
doing.

I did get a new sink pump in and working today after removing it twice to
get the leaks stopped. If you have to put a new pump in make sure that the
glue they seal the bottom with is solid around the wires.

&gt; Did you install the little seals into all the channels yet?
