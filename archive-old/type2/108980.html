Subject: RE: [T2] Exhaust Leak/ Valve Proplem

They are definitely solid lifters. That was one things the mechanic who
did adjust the valves told me. He said maybe it had been changed and I
messed up by adjusting but after I got it back he confirmed that the
valves are solid

Any other possibilities??

Thanks,

Check to see if someone sometime in the past switched the engine to
hydraulic valves...they are adjusted different but can get to taping
when they aren,t right or haven't built up presure...

  I would do this first since it is fairly easy before going anyfurther.

easiest way to be sure is to remove a lifter, so what ever cyl is
easiest
to get to, remove the valve cover, remove the rocker arms, remove the
pushrod, then remove one of the pushrod tubes, then take a magnet on a
stick and pull the lifter out of the engine...a hyd lifter is in several
pieces, a solid lifter is well solid...this is the only way to be
absolutely sure you have solid lifters.
