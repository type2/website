Subject: Rear Seat/bed; nose bra for sale

I've got a black vinyl nose bra and a rear seat/bed for sale.  They both
came with my new '73 and will go for what you'll give me; I don't need
them.  The bra is in very new condition  It was covering some Bondo &quot;work&quot;
that I've since removed.  The seat/bed has all cushions, two tears in the
vinyl, and a few cracks in the wood, fixable but not pretty.

I'm looking for a middle seat, anybody near Mass have one they want to get
rid of?

No progess yet on the electrical(?) problem.  It's hard to diagnose these
these with a dead battery!
