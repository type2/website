Subject: 79' Westy for sale in midwest!
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hi volks, I'm trying to sell my 79' westy. I havent
had any serious offers yet, it's been for sale for 3
months. Isnt there anybody out there looking for a
good condition, (excellent for midwest standards)
meaning very little rust or body repair needed.Engine
runs good considering the weber progrssive 2-bbl.
carb. I hate to see it just sitting there out in the
cold and snow! If anyone knows anyone, that loves or
wants to love a good Westy let me know. Pics are
available, and anytning you need to know I will tell
about it. $ 3500 or best offer.Thank you.
