Subject: leaking gas on driver's side, answer

Casey and the list,

Been there, saw that.  If it is on the drivers side it is definitely the

overflow line.  Reach up from the engine compartment, behind the spare
tire well.  My arm barely reaches it, but I have small arms.  Any ways
the metal tube comes down and then runs parallel to the ground for about

3 inches or so they used rubber line here. and then (I think) runs up
with metal line again.  The leak has to be where this rubber line is.
Most people don't even know about this run of fuel hose so it never gets

replaced.  Definitely replace it.  If this isn't your leak it will leak
eventually so replace it anyways. But I will bet ya it is the culprit.

left to do but,
Snoopy

became full.
