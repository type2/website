Subject: Atlanta-area VW-focused machine shops

Though I've been reading the &quot;dead engine - replace with...&quot; posts with
great interest, being especially enticed by the BFY complete engine
deal, I still want to first try my hand at a home-rebuild.  I already
have a good used case, heads, crank, etc, so I might as well give it a
go and stretch my budget out a bit further.

Anyone know of a machine shop in the Atl area that they would
recommend?
Samba business listing notes one Atlanta shop:  &quot;Northlake Service
Center&quot;  www.vwga_dot_com 
I suppose I'll go with them if no other names come up.
Thanks
Greg &amp; his '71 Westy, Patience.
