Has anyone tried to mount the upright posts (square steel tubes) for a
bike rack onto the brackets which are originally used to mount the two
bumper extensions?  I am referring to the optional extensions which came
on the front bumper of my 78 Westy.  
&gt;&gt;

When I bought my '74 Campmobile more than 10 years ago, The PO had a bike 
rack that strapped to the rear bumper.  There are 2 tubes that strap to the 
bumper with chains and then the frame slides into the tubes.  The upper 
support is two straps that hook above the rear hatch.  This setup could also 
be used on the front bumper and strapped to the spare tire.  I don't like 
carrying the bike on the front, as it gets covered with dead bugs.  You can 
bend your bumper if you overtighten the straps.

I don't know of any good methods to carry bikes on a Bus.  I have a KMart 
bought rack that rests on the rear bumper and straps on pretty well, but you 
can't open your deck lid and check your oil.  A roof rack would be a better 
option, but on a camper, your need to drill into the poptop, or use gutter 
extensions, where you would have to remove the rails to pop the roof.

If you so dare, you can mount a permanent rack to your rear hatch that would 
require drilling.  I may have the guts to try  this one day.
