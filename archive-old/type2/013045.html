darn it!  Sean beat me to a response and is spot on with
everything he said.  I only wanted to add that:

This is, as &quot;VW Tech&quot; Bob says, the &quot;Have you hugged your
engine today?&quot; step.

Put on the dirtiest clothes you got, grab a17mm box wrench, remove the 
oil bath air cleaner and
wrap your arm completely around the right side of the fan housing (the 
tall black thing that the
alternator/generator bolts onto).  The nut is directly behind the fan 
housing, probably just
to the right of and 2&quot; above the flywheel (if you're looking at the 
engine from the back and
drawing an imaginary line straight through to the back firewall).  Be 
careful not to drop the washer,
although it's not too hard to find if you do...

Hope this helps...
