Subject: idle adjustment

Hi guys,

Still trying to get the 74 sportsmobile back home....

Well... i think i have figured out my problems with
the timing.  (or at least it is running ok at about 10
ATDC.  I went on to start adjusting thie idle.  The
Muir book says to adjust to about 900 RPMs however,
With the idle adjust screw fully out i can only get
about 700RPMs?  Anybody have a quick answer

I am also still hearing the pop pop pop sound that
continually comes out of the exhaust.

Jason
