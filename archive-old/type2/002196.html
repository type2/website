Subject: ignition switch

it seems that my ignition switch might be going out ( it works after 1/2
dozon turns then starts)
Is this hard to reinstall another and does the wheel have to come out....i
looked under the wheel and took the panel that covers it off and its just
there ....is it that easy....take it out and put another in? i have 1971
bus......

thanks
jeff
