Subject: Re: March98HotVWs Magazine

I am looking for a March 98 issue of HotVW's magazine for an article on
'Repaint Your 'Wagen'.  I am considering painting my camper bus and the big
expense seems to be in the manual labor involved in preparing the vehicle
for painting.  The June issue indicated that the article in the March issue
was all about preparing the vehicle for painting.  I have read the Haynes
manual and one other 'How to Paint your Car' manual and there are some
contradictions between the two.  I would like to know what HotVWs has to say
about it.  I will be glad to pay the postage etc. if someone will send me
the magazine, or a copy of the article.  I know that back issues can be
ordered ($6.00 each) but it has to be done by check which usually means
waiting xx number of days for the check to clear before the magazine is
shipped via Snail Mail.  If anyone is willing to help, please e-mail me and
I will send the cash.  I am in North Carolina.  Thanks.
