&gt;The motor was stripped of it tin, fan housing, intake, exhaust and

&gt;long? Seconds or minutes?

If you set up a reasonably sized fan to play on the engine, you can run it
for as long as two minutes.  Outdoors, in winter, you can probably run it
longer than that.  If you live in a fair-sized town, or have a high school
with a good art program, or can find a potter, get a couple of pyro cones,
the things used to check temperatures in kilns.  350 F won't hurt an
aircooled engine, so put a 350 cone on the head before you start it.  When
the cone slumps, it's time to shut down.
