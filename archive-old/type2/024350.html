&gt; Also. I've read the virtues of electronic ingnition in the archives &amp;
on the
&gt; list. Anyone with experience of more than one type like to say which
was
&gt; best ? Must be easy to fit/invisible (I'm keeping the bug stock
&gt; looking)/reliable and approriate for 1300 bug &amp; 1600 bus both with
upright
&gt; engines as I want to treat both vehicles.

 I dunno if I qualify: I have a Pertronix points eliminator and a Tiger
CDI.
 Neither is invisible, though the pertronic does a better job, as the 
evidence is only the extra wire (to coil (-)), the missing plastic plug
where the wires enter the dizzy and the absent condensor (which you
could
leave in place if you wanted!).

 From a function point of view I'd follow Bob Hoover's advice and get
the 
Tiger, as it will achieve two objectives: better spark, longer point
life.
 The box is quite big, though, I can't see how you'd make it look stock.
I bought the Pertronix first, as it was available in the UK. I don't
think
that you really need both, however.

&gt; P.S. I always thought the D in DPO stood for Doppy

 I always read it as Dipshit... Not really something to lose sleep
over, 
though :-)

Cheers,
