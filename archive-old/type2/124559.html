Subject: oil drain plug POPED OUT!!!!!

I'm out for my first &quot;drive about&quot; after installing my new clutch when this
lady pulls up next to me at the stop light and says &quot;hay something just blew
out and your spraying water all over the place&quot;



So I pull in to the gas station (luckily the oil light was't even on, yet)
and &quot;shut'er down&quot;, I get out walk to the back and find a HUGE pudel of oil
forming. All draining out of the drain plug. &quot;whew&quot; I think to my self  &quot;at
least I didn't dump all the oil in the street so the motor should still be
ok&quot;



So how can I fix this???
