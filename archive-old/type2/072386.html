Subject: '72 Dist in a '76?

I recently installed a Pertronix in my '76 2000cc FI (California). 
While doing so I noted that my distributor is numbered:

021905205E
231 173 005

I see that this is listed for a '72 engine, but seems to work fine in 
my '76. It passed smog last time, but it took a lot of fiddling at 
the shop which may or may not be due to the skill of the mechanic.

My questions are:

1. Should I leave well enough alone

2 Install the listed distributor for my model and year?

3. Would I see an improvement if I installed the correct part?
