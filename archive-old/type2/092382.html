Subject: brakes and other happy things!

Listees, 

Yeah! I finally have brakes! After many weeks, and a lot of trials, I finally finished my brakes this weekend. New lines, calipers, pads and bleeding. All by myself. (I'm kinda proud of that part!)They do, however make a little noise, but I'm hoping that'll go away (eekk). 

Thanks to all who gave advice and aided me through my first brake journey!

Now, i have a new Carb on it's way and my camper should be done and road worthy (I hope!). My daily driver is in the shop for body work and I'm really in need of transport. 
Hopefully the new carb will fix the &quot;no idle&quot; problem I am having. The bus starts right up, but I have to keep my foot on the gas for any idle. The mechanic I had do my valve adjustment  also fiddled with my carb but said it was in need of a rebuild (understandable). A new one was about as cheap as the kit and the cost of having someone rebuild it for me. Hopefully this will solve the idle problem. Otherwise, I can't guess what it is....

Thanks again all!
