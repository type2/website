Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust stud FART

Hi Don,

Part of the problem with VW exhaust studs is the weight of the heater  
boxes and muffler they are asked to support. Another issue is the  
higher head temps that aircooled engines run at. And they're on the  
bottom of the engine where they are subjected to the worst  
environment possible.

Read my other post for the secret weapon that helped me get the  
inboard #1 exhaust stud loose.
