Subject: Re: [T2] Worst passes

I'm kinda a bike racer as well as a vw dude and have done the Mt Washington 
Auto Road bike race several times. The race is easy, its just 7.6 miles with 
only one hill. One problem though it averages a 12.5 percent grade with 18 
percent sections and a 22 percent short kick at the end.

Anyone ever done it in a bus? Id love to try. F'n scary road. How about 
those brakes?
