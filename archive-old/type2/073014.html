Subject: Re: who uses the good oils....???


Emotes Mr. ZR72_at_aol_dot_com:

&gt;there is going to be a ton more  responses on this FART.

And there was much rejoicing.

Maybe those of you who have something to say about synthetic oil/oil
additives could tag your subject lines with the appropriate acronym FART.
So as to make it easier to filter them.

Also if you are a vendor for a product, and you want to recommend the
product, it would save our time if you would just go ahead and do it rather
than going on for weeks about some mystical magical lubrication secret
known only by you but never quite revealed. There is this thing called
&quot;trolling&quot;.

Speaking merely as a listee,
