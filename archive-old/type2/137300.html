  VW,Vanagon Locking Gas Cap

Looking at the Busdepot link it appears that the 71 would be the same as 
a 73 like mine.

It so, you can get a locking cap from Stant.  Mine has worked very well 
for 3.5 years now.  I think I got it a Pep Boys for around 10 bucks.

&gt;No way no how. It will NOT fit a 68-71 bus. As far as I know, there is no locking cap for 
&gt;your style cap. The only choice you have is to install a lock on your gas door. The cap you have 
&gt;is a 70mm cap that has 3 tabs to go on the outside of the filler neck.
