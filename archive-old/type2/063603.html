A couple of things.  Get on the 'net and find every crewcab offered 
for sale, what ever the year, don't limit to loaf either.
Scour newspapers for the same information.  Scour VW magazines, 
Hemmings Motor News, everywhere for information.  Put it 
together in a presentable format for your Insurance Co.  PROVE that 
your vehicle is worth saving.  You know it, I know it, listees know 
it, but ins co's don't have a clue.  To them it's a '68 VW, worthless.  
That it is a rare, unusual and valuable vehicle has to be PROVEN to 
them.  Be honest and don't snow them, they can tell the condition of 
the vehicle before the accident by looking at it.

When I *totaled* my '76 lots of years ago, I had owned it less than a 
year (5 mo) and had bought it for $4800.  When faced with objective 
evidence (newspaper ads) of what it would cost to buy a COMPARABLE
vehicle, they agreed that it was currently worth $5200 and that is 
what they paid me.  Not bad considering I had put over 20K miles on 
it in 4 months.  This proved to them that I had gotten a *deal* when I 
purchased it as it was *WORTH* more than I had paid for it, not that 
it had been underinsured.

Insurance co's figure that if the repair cost exceeds some 
percentage of the vehicle worth, then it is in their interest to 
&quot;total&quot; it.  Getting the vehicle's *worth* as high as possible is in 
YOUR interest, not theirs, you have to do the work not them.
Get lots of estimates for repairs, not just theirs.

That said, there is another avenue of approach.

Most insurance companies allow you to buy back your vehicle after 
they pay off the 'total'.  Others let you 'bid' on it along with 
others in a general auction of 'totaled' vehicles.  See if you can 
find out, in general, what wreckers would pay for your vehicle as it 
is, and offer more than the going rate to get your vehicle back.  
Point out that they don't have to go through the hassles of selling 
it, since they have a buyer, YOU.

Remember, that you will be buying 
it back as 'junk' and will have to go through full inspection with 
local state police, vehicle inspection, smog etc.  Lights, brakes, 
emissions, and general condition will have be checked prior to 
getting a license.  (speaking of which, if the license plate is 
original to the vehicle, and you wish to keep the vehicle 'original' 
get the plates off the vehicle and you may be able to re-use'm if you
get it the vehicle back as 'junk') otherwise the Ins co turns the 
plates in to the state when processing paperwork for a 'junk' 
vehicle.  But if the plates fell off in the accident . . .

&gt; Alrightee . . .my 1968 Type II Dual cab got into an accident the other day
&gt; and the officer wrote it up as totalled.  The front end was smashed up but
&gt; the insurance company doesn't want to pay for the repair.  Can anybody give
&gt; me an estimate on it before the accident?  It was a '68, white and green
&gt; paint (needed to be redone, but it wasn't too bad) body was in pretty decent
&gt; condition, a little rust in the bed - nothing major, couple of dents here
&gt; and there . . . stock mirrors intact, radio (still working) emblem, seats,
&gt; engine (still running great), rubber was pretty good still, too.  Your
&gt; estimate could save truck!!!!  BTW, I'm not on the mailing list so please
&gt; send all replies to:

&gt; Itzakik_at_tdn_dot_com
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you all very greatly . . .my pickup and I appreciate it!
