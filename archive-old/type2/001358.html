&gt;
&gt; Howdy all!
&gt; Just wanted to see who was going to the Central Ohio Vinatge Volkswagen
&gt; Club's Volkfest show this Saturday Aug 11 in Columbus Ohio, and also
wanted
&gt; to see if there is a place where the bus folks will be camping near-by.  I
&gt; live pretty close and would love to hook up with some fellow bussers for a
&gt; little campground throw down.
&gt;

&gt; microbus with the shovels and rakes and implements of destruction and
&gt; headed on to the police officer's station...&quot;
