&gt; To be fair, these, too, are built by Bosch in Mexico, not Germany (as is
&gt; much of Bosch's product these days; their remans generally aren't
&gt; remaufactured in Germany either).  But these are brand new, not the
&gt; remanufactured ones that are coming out of the same factory.

&gt; I'm not sure why Bosch has been shipping only remanufactured ones to us here
&gt; in the U.S., when this proves that their factory is/was equipped to build new
&gt; ones.

I speculate that the &quot;remanufactured&quot; units were just as new (perhaps up to
one single core part), but that they may have been down-labeled because of
trade restrictions, i.e., high tariffs facing new imports. Might have
something to do with NAFTA. An interesting question...
