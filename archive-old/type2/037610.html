Subject: bogging at low RPM

I am bogging at low rpm's.  It'll catch and speed up as the rpm's get 
higher.  But I remember awhile back someone mentioned something along the 
lines of checking the valve at the bottom of the engine block (1600).  It's 
a screw that you take out.....

Could someone please let me know what the name of it is so I can search the 
archives??  I've done a complete tune up and timed it.  Fuel pump is new 
ect, ect.

TIA

Nothin left to do but smile, smile, smile!!
