Subject: Re: [T2] Seat belts for kids in a bus

The people on the list who asked about kid seats in a bus and rear
shoulder belts-  We have a 78 Westy, and you can put 3 pt
lap/shoulderbelts in the back if they are the stock style taken from the
front seat.  There is a large Phillips screw plug behind the rear seat
left side (easy to find on the passsenger side, difficult on the right,
as it's exactly centered on a hole you must drill 4.25&quot; from the front
of the closet, centered on the frame below the window).  I can supply a
pic to anyone who asks.  I put in a '74 seatbed, and for the driver side
seat, had to use this mount as well as put one in on the frame body wall
wall below the seat (pull the brown panel, you'll see a good spot to
drill a 3/8&quot; hole for a bolt holding the seatbelt.  The shoulder belt is
important in that spot as I didn't want a passenger to lean forward and
hit the sink/closet that I left in place.  For those with the
2-passenger bed, one could add a mount right to the closet wall and beef
up the connections of the closdet to the bus.  
     As for kid seats, I added a lap only belt to the front passenger
seat when it was rotated backwards, and this held the baby seat and
booster seat.  This safely lets the baby ride in front and you can still
give dit attention without constant checking of your rearview mirror if
in the back seat!  
     For safer riding when sleeping, I had 2 designs- one holds the rear
seatbed front folded upwards by using chains from large eyebolts mounted
above; the went around the frame bits mounted under the front hinging
part of the bed.  The other, for bigger people, was a nylon divider that
spanned across the bottom of the seatbed front, and also went to the
eyebolts via a rod that went through a sewn loop of the nylon before
going into the eyebolts.  Put 1&quot; styrofoam along the rear sides for
accident protectionI also dreamed of this odd sleeping bag with sewn in
side loops that went to eyebolts along the sides, so you couldn't roll
to far (-8
