Subject: Re: [T2] unpadding dash?

Hello,

That would be me. I ended up using a course barrel
wire brush on an angle grinder to remove the stubborn
bits of foam that I could not peal off. I remember it
being time consuming. Try to peal off as much vinyl as
you can first. It has been some time ago since I did
it. I most likely used paint stripper to remove the
remaining glue and paint. be prepared to weld and or
fill up the extra holes in the dash. Good Luck!

Regards,

David Kelly

&gt; Somebody posted a picture of their dash that had

&gt; to long ago and I was wondering what did they use to
&gt; take all of the foam 
&gt; residue off? I've tried this stuff called Goo Off
&gt; and mineral spirits and 
&gt; neither of it worked. Any suggestions?
