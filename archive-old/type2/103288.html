well you know that with $$$ you can do it, the question is how much money
are you willing to spend.....you need to get the door and associated
hardware, don't know how much is interchangeable with RH slider...also if
possible get the plans for whatever is done to the stock VW double door
units, do they reenforce the frame or otherwise stiffen the body...??

would be interesting, keep us up on this project

&gt; this?  Snowed in with 30 + inches in Harpers Ferry, WV and just dreaming ;0)

yeah we only had 27 inches spent most of the day digging it out, found
aches in places I didn't know I had places...
