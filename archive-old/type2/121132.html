Subject: Re: what color were the original cast iron dizzies??

Vincent, dizzie or dizzy is short form for distributor. Some of us English
speakers are too lazy to spell the whole word out. Hope that helps you. My
apologies, I sometimes forget not all our people on the list speak English
as a first language.

 

Kindest regards,

Courtney

Subject: Re: what color were the original cast iron dizzies??

 

&gt; Just wondering if anyone has one of the early early

&gt; dizzies and could tell

&gt; me the color? I seem to recall it being not black

&gt; but a brownish black??? I

&gt; m going to paint a restored 010 for my engine and

&gt; want a close match.

 

Sorry, I have a question because English is not my

native language: what are 'dizzies'?

 

May be I can look up what the colour was.

 

 

yours,

 

Vincent
