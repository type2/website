This happened to me as well, not to the extent yours did.

The HE's filled up with oil from leaking pushrod tubes. When the HE's got
hot the smell would come in though the vents and a coating of bluish film
would start to appear on my windshield. I dropped my motor and removed all
the metal that was coated with oil and cleaned it well. removed the fan
housing and split it in half and cleaned it out. Took the heat exchangers
off and took them to the BBQ. Turned the BBQ up to High and left them in
there for about two hours each. It burned all the oil out of the HE's.

Put all parts back on the engine and reinstalled. The smell was considerably
better and went away entirely within a week.

You could do the same thing to the HE's without removing the engine. I just
wanted the smell to go away so badly that I was willing to take extreme
measures.
