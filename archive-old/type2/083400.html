&gt; I retract my previous question, there are two ports that are not on the

&gt; One comes up out of the base at an angle, and the other comes out of the
&gt; back of the carb right next to the connection for the dizzy vac line.
&gt; Does anyone know what the purpose of these are, and if I need to plug
&gt; them or not?
&gt;
&gt; Picture of the two ports:

These are ports for different vacuum signals from different parts of the
intake system.  Keep 'em plugged if you don't use them.
