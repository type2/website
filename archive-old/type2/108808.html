Subject: Re: [T2] Heads/shims/gaskets Oh my

The original build of the TypeIV engine had a paper gasket between the
cylinders and the crankcase and the head ship between the head and the
cylinder.  As you know, VW later changed that to eliminate the head shim and
substitute a metal spacer for the paper gasket between the cylinders and
crankcase.

The very, very safest thing to do is to cc the heads, measure the deck
height (no gasket or shim), do the calculation for compression ratio, and
shim between the cylinders and crankcase accordingly.

If you can't or don't want to do that then you'll have to take a chance and
put it back together with what you've got.  If you purchased a gasket kit
from the Bus Depot then the kit most likely has the &quot;head&quot; shims.  Since the
head shims and cylinder/crankcase shims are completely different sizes you
can quickly tell which you have by trying to insert one in the head.  (Even
though VW said to stop using head shims years ago any gasket kit I've bought
has had those shims included.)

Since you didn't have the heads machined you should be OK going this route,
assuming the CR was basically OK to begin with and that the new
pistons/cylinders don't materially affect your deck height.

Subject: [T2] Heads/shims/gaskets Oh my


&gt; I'm in the process of putting together my 2.0 GE 1979 engine, had the
heads
&gt; cleaned and checked (not machined) and have new piston/liners on the way.
&gt; When putting the liners back on, do I use the metal shim gaskets that I
&gt; received with my rebuild kit from Bus Depot? Or are these shims supposed
to
&gt; go between the head and the top of the piston liners?
&gt;
&gt; Boston engine states : eliminate the head gasket and replace it with a
1.6mm
&gt; aluminum shim (#071 101 34), or a steel one, at the base of the cylinder
&gt; between the cylinder and crankcase.
&gt;
&gt; But when I yanked the engine apart, the shims were not on the crank case,
&gt; rather in the head.
&gt;
&gt; Do I do shims in both places?
&gt;
&gt; All this talk about deck hight is confusing me! Since I didn't machine the
&gt; heads at all, the height shouldn't be affected right?
