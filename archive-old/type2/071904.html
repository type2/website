	An aside to folk with starter bushing problems. I have been waiting
for months for someone to ask about what to do if their starter bushing is
so worn that the starter motor shaft has started to eat its way into the
alloy casing. Yes, it happend to me. The answer is silver solder. Melted
onto the outside of the bushing and ground down to fit the distorted hole
in the engine nice and tightly. It's still there nine months later and
doing just fine.

&gt;Rick,
&gt;
&gt;I read a day or two ago about how a worn starter bushing will mess up your
&gt;starting ability. First it starts just dragging; then it gets worse and
&gt;worse. Of course, the bushing is tough to remove without the engine out,
&gt;but I actually read about this in a VW Trends article describing how to
&gt;use a starter bushing removal tool........
