&gt; &gt;&gt; Well, bay-window Buses do have some variation of heat exhausters.  When
the
&gt; &gt;&gt; VWs were new, they were basically air-tight.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; On a Bus they did a similar thing.  If you look at the bottom of each
front
&gt; &gt;&gt; door there is a black plastic grille with a blue slider.  This is your
&gt; &gt;&gt; exhauster.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Late bays have this.  Early Bays do not.  I just crack the left rearmost
&gt; &gt; wing window.
&gt;
&gt; How late of a bay is a &quot;late bay&quot;? My 1972 has these.

I believe they started in 71.....very tough to find early door panels
without a %#*_at_ speaker hole cut in it AND no rectangular hole for the vent.
In addition to the vent in the door panel, VW also put 5 oval/square holes
in the front edge of the door as part of the 'flow-thru ventilation'.
