Check out Bus Boys in Redding
California,(http://www.bus-boys_dot_com/bb13374.htm).  They have the outsides
for $6.50 or the whole plug for $10.something.

Have fun

&gt;Hey gang,
&gt;
&gt;I found 2 of my fuel injector connectors (plugs?) were broken and not
&gt;holding the injector terminals tightly.  Does anyone know if you can just
&gt;replace the connectors, or do you have to replace the entire FI harness?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
&gt;
