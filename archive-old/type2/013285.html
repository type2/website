You might also be able to use a sump plate from a Porsche 914 engine, as
they usually fit onto the Type4 engines (although I'm unsure if/how this
applies to all bus years - I do know it fits onto my '79).  If you can find
one of these, it will have a pre-drilled/pre-threaded hole into which you
can simply twist the oil temperature sender, and then you can just replace
your bus' existing sump plate with the Porsche plate/temp sender set-up. 
The only catch, I think, is that you may have to saw off a small portion of
the end of your dipstick to shorten it so that it doesn't hit a certain
protruding part of the inside of the Porsche plate.  This won't affect oil
readings, though. I'm pretty sure that there is more info on this approach
within the Type2 archives.
