Subject: pressure regulator?
Message-ID: &lt;d04a79b2.2458c50b_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I just order an eletric fuel pump to replace my stupid mechanical one in my 
'72 Westy /w 1700cc Pancake engine w/ twin weber carbs.  Do I need a pressure 
regulator to keep my carbs being ruined or something?  And a cutoff switch to 
stop the pump from pumping when the carb bowl is full?  In other words I 
don't know what i'm doing, what should the pressure be for twin (single 
barrel) weber carbs?Where do I get this stuff If I need it?  Please help me 
out.

Thanks,
Shawn
