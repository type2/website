Hi,

   Dano Fagan writes: 

&gt; It started as a
&gt; faint jerking under load, but has eventually evolved
&gt; into violent kicking, most noticeably under load. 
&gt; Some 600 or so miles ago it also started faintly
&gt; backfiring and it too has gotten more noticeable and
&gt; severe.  Turning on the lights makes the problem
&gt; worse.

 Sounds like a bad coil to me. Try and find a known 
good one to swap in and see if the problem goes away.

Cheers,
	 W.

PS Rule of thumb for diagnosing engine problems:
    &quot;It's always electrical&quot;.
