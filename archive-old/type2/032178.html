Thanks for the help...after some more investigation today, it looks like I
have a classic vacuum leak problem.  I sprayed down the join between the
mainfold and the head with WD-40, and the idle didn't change...but when I
rev up the engine, it bubbles and fizzes.  The problem here is probably
that I used sealer instead of a real gasket.  (Stupid,  I know, but my
FLAPS told me the gaskets were NLA.)  It's too cold out to work on it now
(removing/installing those manifolds is its own special hell), so I'll
probably remove them next term break, in May, and have the ends machined
flat and put them back on with new gaskets.
