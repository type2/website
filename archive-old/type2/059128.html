Subject: RE: Bad 1.3/1.5/1.6L Dansk mufflers! - George Lyle 10-3-98

[...]
My daughter's boyfriend drives a '59 double-door panel with a stock 1600DP 
engine installed by the previous owner.  It has an extractor exhaust system 
that looks like the typical &quot;single quiet pack&quot; setup, but is at least as 
quiet as a stock factory exhaust system.

Our '70 Campmobile runs an S&amp;S single quiet pack extractor system on it's 
stock 1600SP.  Our current system is new and absolutely tight - no leaks 
anywhere.  The difference in sound level between these 2 systems on very 
similar engines is absolutely amazing.

Ben is trying to track down information on his '59's exhaust system from the 
PO.  If we learn anything about it's origin and manufacture I'll post it to 
the List.  Wherever/however it originated, I want one!

&gt;&gt; This raises an interesting question.  I wonder if bug mufflers and bus 
mufflers are identical except for the deletion of one outlet and the addition 
of the support tab for the tailpipe?  Inquiring minds...
