Subject: I[T2] RE: CVS Cooler $4.99 38 cans 24 qts NO!! 24 liters; 26
  quarts!!

Man, my eyes are BAD!!  Should be 24 liters/ 26 quarts.  But you found out
when you saw the pictures.  Thank the good people at Craftsman for the
Harley LARGE print....   I guess when the Harley people pick up the wrong
size socket, they get so angry that they crunch the socket with their molars
and take the flattened socket back to Sears (teach them Sears people a
lesson!!)

I guess I should know the mm size of the socket by just looking at it, but a
simple misread can cause me to have to crawl back out from under the VW to
find the correct socket.  Like the 12mm and 13mm when pulling off exhaust
manifold/muffler/heat exchanger nuts.
