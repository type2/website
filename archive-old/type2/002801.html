Subject: downshifting...:) (headliner)
Message-ID: &lt;001f01beccc3$7a43b820$a6ab8318_at_USER.ce.mediaone_dot_net&gt;

Thanks for all you feedback!! I dont hate stick, i love it at times. I live
in chicago so Im not coasting from 50mph to a stop, I have no hills so not
being in gear at any time shouldnt be a legal question,  In city driving
stick just isnt as efficient, I enjoy the extra power though when I need it.
Was just wondering on the point. It seems that downshifting is a personal
pref. more then a mech. prerequisite. I can see your point on hills and such
and I do down shift to lower gears if trfc slows. Im not simple,,:) I just
know people that get it up to 40 on a side street then downshift to a stop
at the corner. Youve just shifted  7 or 8 times in 40 secs.... you cant tell
me that makes sense? Just thought maybe there was a mech theory behind
pulling your bus outta gear while its in third to coast and re-engage into
first after the stop.
listees, the salt of the earth!!!!
I LOVE YOU ALL!!! &gt;:p

Question two. (sigh  :_at_  )
Has anyone ever put paneling up for a headliner. Im going through the
interior and am replacing the paneling throughout, front kick panel, sides,
roof sides(highroof) etc. I would think one solid piece of fairly light
paneling would be easier ( and cheaper) to install then a headliner...any
thoughts?
