Two horns of the same type will have slightly different frequencies and
sound awful together.

&gt; Hiya List,
&gt; 
&gt; Seems like all my posts have to do with horns.  Here's my contribution for 
&gt; today.......I'm looking for the OEM Bosch horn for a 1970 Bus.  Not an 
&gt; aftermarket Bosch but the original from 1970.  I've struck out twice at the 
&gt; local boneyards so far.  I'm going to set the Bus up with dual horns and I'd 
&gt; like them to be the same.  Does any kind soul out there have one in good 
&gt; working order they'd like to get rid of?
