List,
    So when I take my heads into the machine shop on Monday, do I tell them
to stake, swedge, or peen or any combo of the 3?  Staking sounds to make
more sense, but I really don't know.  I've decided on nickel valve seats and
stainless steel valves.  Judging from the condition of my engine and heads
and gauges at the time of seat droppage, I can say that heat was not the
main factor.  Maybe these tired old dogs wanted to take a break.  Anyway,
we'll keep you posted on the valve job.  I want to get my bus back on the
raod so I can cruise up to KS and drag race.  hehe.

TIA
