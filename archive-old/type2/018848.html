Looks like these might be unavailable. I tried vw dealer and RMMW, WCM,
Wolfsburg West catalogs with no success. Does anyone know if these are
available anywhere? What is everyone doing with the by now disintegrated
screens on their old vans. If I can't find a replacement, I guess I can
fabricate something out of some 1/8&quot; mesh screen.
