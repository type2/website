Subject: Valve adjustments 

The recent posting by Mike Skaggs makes me wonder about my own '78 with
hydraulics.

The Bentley book says tighten the adjustment screw until it just touches
the vavle stem. Then do two turns more. Is that two turns of 360 degrees or
two turns of 180 degrees? 

When I set them with two turns of 360 degrees, it holds the vavles open and
then engine barely runs. Two tunrs of 180 degrees and the sound loose (of
course the lifters are worn out I suspect and I worry about the condition
of the rocker arms - the maybe worn out too, I'll check that out too - what
do I look for?)

Anyone able to help?

Thanks!
