Subject: RE: Gas heaters again. Wanted heater exhaust pipe
Date: Fri, 15 Sep 2000 14:18:44 -0400

Regarding gas heaters:

I believe you can still buy new ones from the original supplier. I've seen
them
advertised in the past. Also Westwinds sells gas heaters?

Regarding commonness in Canada. I can remember when the gas heater was an
option in bugs (Late 60's early 70's). One that almost everyone where I grew
up went for.
I'm not sure what the situation was in buses. I'm not sure there were any
buses
in town. Although the mine had a VW pickup that must have been around
a 61, or 62 singlecab because the mine closed in 65, and we moved into town.
I remember  lot of discussion about the VW as they were fairly new up there,
and my
dad being the mine's mechanic (along with about 10 other roles) had quite a
bit to say
about this new German pickup he had to maintain. Don't remember any comments
about heat 
for the pickup.  I can't recall when I saw my first bus, but if must have
been after I moved south?
I wonder what happened to that pickup? I bet its still parked beside the
shop up at 2 shaft??
Probably has good sized trees growing through it by now?

Anyone know where I can get a new exhaust pipe for the gas heater. Mine is
getting pretty rusty.
Although I seldom use it as I don' t drive it in the winter anymore, I'd
like to replace it, because its
about the only thing on my van that's not up to spec, and I sort of like to
keep it all up to spec.

I live in Ottawa Canada, so shipping costs could be an issue, but I wouldn't
mind if I could get one
in really good condition.  I don't want to spend big shipping bucks on one
that is almost rusted out.
