List-
Since this is friday I thought you all might like to know I say a early
split on the cartoon &quot;Spiderman&quot;  You see the bad guy bomb the bus.  And
then the fire dept putting it out.  The bad guy didn't have to burn the
van &quot;most of them burn on there own&quot; :) Ha, ha (joke)

just for fun
Chuck
