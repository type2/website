Subject: Re: [T2] 1971 bay vs 1969 bay

&gt; The only way to tell a '68 from a '69 on the exterior is the different door
 handles.  Other than that, they're identical from the outside.  Although I
 do think there are a few other small differences overall, I once heard
 mention of no firewall in the engine compartments of '68s, is this true?

 On a semi-related note, does anyone know what years they used the door locks
down next to the interior handle on the front doors rather than the more
standard top-pull position?  And does anyone know why they changed?

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

68 also uses one-year-only wiper arms. They attach like 67 and back. The nut on the shaft style started in 69.

68 doors are one-year-only. The lock knob is on top of the sill like 75? and up. But the doors do not have
ventilation vents in them. 69-74? the lock lever is next to the inner handle. Door vents started in 70 or 71.
68 door handles are push button like 64-67 but the paddles are a different length. Lever action handles
started in 69.
