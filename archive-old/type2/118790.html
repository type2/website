Subject: Fuel line modification

Hi Listees,
    With all the recent talk of fires, fuel lines, and modifications I
thought I'd add my 2 cents.  We have a '71 with a stock 1600 dual port
engine installed.  In an effort to making removing the engine easier I
modified the fuel line and routing.  Now I don't have to go under the
bus, and get gasoline on me, to disconnect the fuel line.  I can do it
in the engine compartment.
    First thing I did was to procure a rubber grommet that fits in a 1
inch whole and has a 1/4 inch hole in the middle of it.  Then I
drilled a 1 inch hole in the body work, just a little to the left of
the engine.  Then I replaced the rubber fuel line that would normally
connect the tank outlet to the metal line that passes through the
engine tin.  The new fuel line was made from a long, metal brake line.
On one end it connects to the tank outlet with a short piece of rubber
hose.  It follows the stock fuel line routing under the body with the
exception that it continues out to where the new hole is.  The other
end passes through the grommet and a few inches into the engine
compartment.  Then there is a short section of rubber fuel line
connecting the fuel filter, which is mounted in a holder, to the metal
line.  Then the output end of the filter is connected to the fuel pump
using rubber line.  And of course I put a plug in the original fuel
line hole that's in the engine tin.   To see what I'm trying to
explain go to http://photos.yahoo_dot_com/lihikers  and click on the album
titled &quot;fuel filter&quot;.  You know the old saying &quot;a pictures worth a
thousand words&quot;
