Thanks - the key turns smoothly to On then to contact - nothing clunky or
forced.  Just nothing happening at contact.  If kept in contact and wiggled
profusely until the &quot;sweet spot&quot; is found it kicks right over.

Thanks for the tips.

Danny

&gt; Danny,
&gt; Its your ignition lock, switch or the wiring harness where it enters
&gt; the switch. You've defined it yourself: All power to everything else is
&gt; fine, you had to do all kinds of intersting wiggling to get it to
&gt; function.
&gt; You don't say whether you had to do the interesting wiggles to get
&gt; the key to TURN or whether the wiggles had to be added on top of
&gt; turning it. If the problem is getting the key to turn to the START
&gt; position then its MOST likely to be a lock problem. If the problem
&gt; is that turning to the START location doesn't do anything without
&gt; some wiggling, then its MOST likely to be the switch.
&gt; Of course, a balky lock can mask a flakey switch. Test BOTH when
&gt; you get them appart.
