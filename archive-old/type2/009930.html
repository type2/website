Subject: Another Exhaust Question
Message-Id: &lt;199906212345.TAA09679_at_rotary.type2_dot_com&gt;

Hey All --
A quick (hopefully not stupid) question about exhaust and stuff -- again. 
Various query combos w/in the archives couldn't drum up anything applicable
for me.  Anyway, my muffler has is rusting through in multiple spoys, is
getting loud, and I'm going to replace it ASAP.  Can a faulty or
degenerated leaky muffler like this have an effect on how the engine runs
-- that is, can it make it run/idle erratically and/or lose power?  Just
curious, as I'm having a few simultaneous symptoms similar to this.  Thanks
in advance for any comments.
