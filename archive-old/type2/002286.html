Has anyone had any luck taking their bus to a local shop / chain store to
have the rear sag adjusted out?  I'm squatting pretty low but don't really
have the tools.  My local shade-tree VW &quot;dude&quot; says he is scared of them for
some reason and won't touch it, I dunno why.

Also, what shocks work well on loaf Westy's, anything in particular?

Thanks to you folks' tips, Time Traveler &quot;TT&quot; is starting every time- but I
think I'll keep the re-man starter I bought anyway.

PARTS BIN: '67 Bug Oil-bath air cleaner, good shape, recently sold the car
but forgot to send it with the new owner as I had put a paper one on it-
email me if you could use it! For a 1500cc, has double intake.
