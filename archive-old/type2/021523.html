Subject: a few bits...

Well, heres a few things piled into one email.  I've been busy working 
and what not the past few days, so I've to catch up :)

First off, Chris Ricciotti left here Tuesday night in his 73 highroof 
(reminds me of Wendelin!!) headed home for Boston.  He and his highroof 
seemed to be in good shape for the trip.  I haven't heard from him yet, 
but hopefully will soon.  Chris was a lot of fun to hang around with, 
and I wish he could have stayed longer and have been able to attend the 
campout here this weekend.  We fixed him up with another tranny from a 
73 just for some &quot;insurance&quot;  He'll most likely be needing one in the 
near future anyways... Lets hope not though.

Second, how many people here drive 2 buses?  I drive 2 buses a day on 
many days...  Its kind of strange.  Hop in the 71 and go to work, come 
home and go out for a cruise in the 62 for some ice cream.  Its like 
driving 2 totally different cars.  It seems the 71 is much smoother and 
more like riding on air.  Everything is smoother and easier in that bus. 
  The pedals (especially the brake) go down with ease, it goes over 
bumps with ease, and just kind floats down the road.  On the other hand 
you're bouncing all over the seat in the 62, all the pedals are harder 
to push, shifting is much tighter (a good thing!!) etc etc.  I get a 
kick out of it...its fun.

Can bus rockers be patched?  On the 62 there are a couple little spots 
on each rocker that look like they could just be patched.  The whole 
rocker isn't rusted out, just one little area on each rocker.  Maybe its 
just better to do the whole thing??  I'm no body man, so..?
Also, that paint that I had mixed up here in town is *really* close to 
the paint on the 62.  They mixed it from the L380 paint code (turkis) so 
I knew it would be close, but its always off just a bit.  I'm very 
pleased with it.  I sprayed a real small area that nobody will see 
anyways...  It turned out good.

Third, are there any BMW guys or gals out there?  I just bought a '93 
318is....  I've a few questions on them.


Have a good weekend everyone!  I'm hopefully takin off tomorrow right 
after work to go do some campin!!

Isaiah
