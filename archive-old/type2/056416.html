Subject: Help! Rebuild Runs Bad!

Hello Everyone.  Well like an idiot I decided to swap an the engine in
my 76 Westy with a rebuilt back in May thinking it would be broke in
just in time for summer.  I did an engine swap and had it shipped to a
mechanic who works on my bus.  Well it is still running like crap and I
am starting to panic.  I had to have it towed twice because the valves
needed readjusted.  They guy who put it in has it now and he is trying
to figure out the problem.  He said the lifters have came loose on him
twice and it seems to skip and hesitate around 55 but runs better at
higher speeds.  It runs rough at idle and starts to smoke when it gets
warmed up.  (I know you are not supposed to let a rebuilt idle for too
long or drive it at higher speeds -this is what the mechanic is telling
me about the diagnosis)  This guy has an excellent reputation around
here but I wanted to consult the list to see if I could get any
suggestions.  The compression on one side was low so he thought it might
be that it is just not broke in all the way.  It has about 500 miles on
it so I let him keep it until it gets &quot;broke in&quot; or he finds the
problem.  He said he was going to check the compression again today and
let me know.  He also said he thought a piston ring hasn't quite seated
in one of the cylinders.  Any advise?
Phillip
76 Westy
