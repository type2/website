Since I have bought a NEW Bosch starter I have not had the hot start problem
either, even on longer trips.

&gt; Hi Travis, and everyone else too,
&gt;   The hot start problem certainly is a common one.  To avoid it I took to
a
&gt; yearly maintenance routine for the starter.  Now, once a year I deal with
&gt; the starter when and where I decide to.  You know, at home in the driveway
&gt; on a warm dry day.
&gt;    I completely disassemble it and clean, inspect and repair it as
required.
&gt;   I lubricte all the mechanical parts at reassembly.  Also at the same
time
&gt; I clean all of the wire connections for the starter and solenoid as well
as
&gt; the posts on the starter/solenoid.  Since you have to disconnect the
battery
&gt; to do this safely, I remove the battery, clean it(posts as well as the
&gt; outside of the battery case) and service the water as needed.  This is an
&gt; opportune time to clean the terminals on the battery wires and the chassis
&gt; to engine/transmission ground strap.
&gt;    Since I've started doing this I've never had the dreaded hot start
&gt; problem.  It may be the answer to your problem, or it might not.
