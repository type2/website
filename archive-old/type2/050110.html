Subject: Re: [T2] Rod Movement

Hello list and Jeff      The side play for rods is .004 to .015  ,wear limit 
is .027   The thing you need to do is check the dead end play of the 
crankshaft. To do this you remove the flywheel, seal, shims and reinstall the 
flywheel without shims&amp; seal . If the dead end play is above .050 you are 
taking a big chance putting just p&amp;c's on. To double check remove one rod and 
see how the bearings look.    Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service  Salem  Va.
