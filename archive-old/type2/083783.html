Subject: Re:[T2] hoover bit? shroud louvers?

--=====================_889472414==_

since I have the engine out, how vital are the mentioned pieces?  Louvers, thermostat, hoover bit?  Seems if I need em, now is the time. 

From all that i've read and been schooled on...the off-set doghouse oil cooler, and thermostat controls, are one of the best investments in keepin your volksie alive. 
and as soon as i get back from the gathering this summer, i'm pullin my engine to put all these pieces on my 1600DP. just need to get HOME first;) 
but, personally, i'd go ahead and do the work while u have the engine out. *shine on* -Chris w/a 70'westie
