Subject: RE: More More More Octane 

Sean, you are right. I never paid attention to the U.S. Cost of Living  (CLC) termonology. SO MUD in my face. Bucked off in a blaze of glory. Been there, too many times. My excuse? Ignorance. My rationale? I don't know the exact compression ratio of every veedub I work on. I feel it is in everyones best interest when asked about fuel to recommend the best. That way, no one gets in trouble. If I did it the opposite, I COULD get in trouble. I will continue to do the same but, thanks to you, use the correct termonology. Thank GOD this is over. Next time I'll keep FOOT out of MOUTH!!! Jim Duncan OUT way OUT

&gt; 
&gt; Hey. On the chart for octane req. vs. compression I draw the line at =
&gt; exactly 90 RON   Yes, it says RON. Now, this is for water pumpers, so =
&gt; tell me how VW came up with 91 RON for air-cooled heads.

I don't know man, I just know what I read in the manual.  VW said
minimum 91 RON.

The required octane is related to the compression ratio of the engine
only.  With a 7.3:1 ratio (like my Vanagon and Karmann Ghia have), 91
RON is the way to go, which is equal to 87 at US gas pumps.


In 1969, was =
&gt; gasoline rated by the RON only? 


You got me, I wasn't even born then.  Joel Walker says they changed from
RON to CLC in the mid-'70s sometime.


I can't see them expecting you to come =
&gt; up and use a formula every time you bought gas. By the way, I don't want =
&gt; a battle of wits here, I'm very easy going and love to learn new shit =
&gt; about thing's i'm interested in. So, convince me. And, yes,I do know the =
&gt; difference between detonation, pre-ignition and spark-knock. And the bug =
&gt; motor came out at 7.38 to1 when it was assembled. I had to buy gas (reg) =
&gt; in Austin NV. one time ( Chevron 87) and it pinged. Anyhoo, it's late. =
&gt; 
Maybe you got a batch of bad gas, maybe you were overheating, maybe your
timing was off, who knows?  

All I know is I keep the timing dead on in both my vehicles and run 87
octane, and I never get any pinging (and yes, I've driven my Vanagon
with the engine cover off.  Damn loud inside, but no pinging :-)

All I'm saying is that according to VW, the minimum octane gasoline for
the engine is 91 RON 

They also say immediately below that in the manual, that in the US, the
CLC method is used, not the RON method.  They explain that the CLC
method is the average of the RON and MON method, i.e. (RON+MON)/2.  They
also also say that the CLC number is usually 4 points less than the RON
number, and they explicitly state that 91 RON = 87 CLC.

So all I'm saying is that VW specifically said that in the US, use 87
octane gas.
