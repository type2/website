Subject: Short pushrods, or Weak Hyd. Lifters

Hello everybody,
    I just got done searching the library and all my available resources, all 
to no avail.  Some of you may recall some parts of this project that i have 
been working on for the last couple months. It's my friends 76 FI with 
hydrolic lifters.
    The cylinder heads are on, and everything is ready to go in, but it seems 
that the pushrods aren't quite long enough. The rockers are on right, and 
everything else fits perfect, it just seems that the rods need to be about 
3/4&quot; longer. They are new rods, and have been compared to the old ones and 
are the exact same length.
   The only thing that i can think of that would explain this is that the 
lifters are decompressed since its been so long since they have been under 
pressure. When I did similar work on my bus, I had no such experience. I 
thought that if we put the engine in and spun it a few times, they may have a 
chance to pressureize. I'm afraid to do this though since i may cause more 
damage by throwing the rods around in there.
    Any help would be great if you could steer me in the right direction. I 
have the Haynes, but that is over his house, and my Muir doesnt mention 
anything like this.

Thanks 
  Matt O.
