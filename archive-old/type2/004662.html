Just got a 77 campervan well about a week and I luv it so I am going to
Europe in it so here are a few thing's I need to sort out.
OIL SEAL BEHIND PULLEY
Is this a big job as it is leaking abit and I am planning a big trip.  Or
shall I leave alone and keep eye on oil light.
Brake are squeking a little is there anything I should know about when
changing pads.
I have a VDU oil pressure gauge and when I turn the ignition on it goe's
right of the scale and stays there but the engine seem's to be running fine
in fact it has only done 4-5000 miles since new and it will do 80 no
problem.
EMPI EXHAUST
I bought one of these and took it back because it did not have the bit where
you join the pipe's to and then off leading to the heat exchangers could I
just do away with this bit that is missing on these pipes and just extend
the pipework from fan housing to heat exchanger.
I have done quite alot of job's myself already like getting the electric's
going inside the bus i.e fridge, running water and socket's bought a new
striplight today as both of the existing one's dont work get on that
tomorrow.
I  have the flint lighter missing from my Electrolux RM120 fridge doe's
anyone know of a source for one of these have tried a couple of companies
already only to be told I am four years too late.
Thanks for any help
