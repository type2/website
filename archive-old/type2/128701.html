Subject: Re: [T2] motor question...

Kroil is another good engine loosening liquid---let it soak for a couple
of day and bar it over--

Works real good on old derelict, locked up, John Dere's tractor's
anyway--

Hi Jim, 
One trick I have used for freeing up a stuck motor is Coca-Cola in each
of the cylinders and then let it sit.

Marvel Mystery Oil is prob a better choice for this although even some
plain (fresh) oil squirted into each spark plug holes would be a good
idea. 
Of course you can turn it over manually with a wrench on the crank bolt,
and then there is the 'leave it in gear and bump the car a little'
trick, just to break the grasp of the rings on the sides of the
cylinders.
