Subject: [T2] intake manifolds: bus vs. bug

I'm buying parts to build a new 1600DP engine for my '71 Westy.  RMMW lists
different part numbers for DP intake manifolds for bus and bug, with the
bus version being more expensive.

I just assumed that a '71 engine is a '71, regardless of whether it is bus
or bug.  What is different about the intake manifold for a bus?

Thanks, Jack
