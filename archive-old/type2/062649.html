Subject: Hot Running 73 Westy

A few days ago I described the particulars of my bus running hot 
(250F).  I have received a lot of good advice. I am acting on 
it!  Hopefully it will get my temps down.

Since then, this list briefly discussed the effects of 
driving a bus without the heater pipes attached.  I am now starting 
to question if this may be part of my problem.  Currently, I am 
driving my bus with no heat.  Inside the engine compartment, both 
heater tubes are blocked by way of two beer cans (Genessee) to avoid 
heat being dumped into my engine compartment.  Under the bus on 
the left side, my heater pipe is removed from the exhaust manifold 
forward.  On the right side the pipe is detached just infront of the 
control flap (approximately 1 foot in front of the exhaust manifold). 
 When on the highway will air push heat though the heater pipe on the 
left side and into my cooling system?  (This would seem possible side 
since the hole faces forward into clean air).  Or is it just the 
opposite...Without the pipe, does cooling air take the route of least 
resistance and travel out my manifold area instead of across my 
cylinders?  

If it's one or the other, should I attach another Genny can under 
my bus?  Should it have some holes to let some air through 
like the flapper on the right side?

Thanks in advance,  

Jeff
