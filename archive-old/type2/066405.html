Subject: Solid or Hydro lifters?

I have a '77 and a '78 Bus. I know that a '77 comes with solid lifters and
that a '78 has hydros. I want to rebuild both engines but would like to
convert the '77 to a hydro. I assume this is possible but was wondering if
anyone could give me ballpark prices and maybe a list of all I need to do
to the '77 to make it hydro.
