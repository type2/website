&gt; Well tomorrow I am on the hunt at garage sales for my
&gt; set of chains. I do plan on bringing a shovel and also
&gt; hooking a tow strap to the beam of the bus before hand
&gt; so that I don't have to lie in the mud just in case.
&gt; Anyone else have any suggestions as to other stuff I
&gt; might need, I do have a list of my own, but I am sure
&gt; there is some stuff I may have overlooked. By the way,
&gt; is there any way to get a copy of that video??

&gt; &gt; You'ld probably have to measure them on your tire. 
&gt; &gt; I know I have had chains 
&gt; &gt; that will fit the 14&quot;s but not the 15&quot; tires.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I saw the video of last years crazy snow camping
&gt; &gt; trip which included lots of 
&gt; &gt; adventures and is not for the faint heated or those
&gt; &gt; worried about a scratch 
&gt; &gt; in the paint.  Bring shovels and plywood and someone
&gt; &gt; bring a rope and a come 
&gt; &gt; a long.
&gt; &gt;   Too far for me to go.    :(
