Subject: Stuff for sale

Hello again,
	Poor Nanook is too cancerous for me to repair, and since my '73 is in such
good shape, I have decided that Nanook needs to enter to donor pool.
	First let me tell you that I am in the Eugene Oregon area, so keep that in
mind, if you want some of the bigger stuff.
	What I would like to do is have someone come and take all of Nanook in one
fell swoop.
Here is Nanook's important info:
	1976 Camper with a Sportmobile Penthouse pop-top.  The Canvas could use
some work.
	Interior: both upper cabinet and closet, rear cabinet on floor, sofa bed.
The sink, cooler was replaced (by the PO) with a propane heater in a plywood
box.  All wall and ceiliing liners are in good shape.  Door liners are all
in place, the driver's side is damaged.  Drivers and Passengers seats both
need to be reupohlstered and repadded.
	Engine: 2.0 litre, dual solex PDSIT 34-2/3 carbs.  ALL of the electrical
doo-dads that are supposed to be with them are in place!!!!!  Some of these
were hard to find.  Mechanical lifters.  Runs very strong with good power.
Vac Advance/retard dizzy.  It had an 009, if you want that, I've got it.  I
Don't know the true MPG.
	Tranny:  Good strong 4 speed manual.  It hasn't given me any problems.
	Body:  Well, like I said, it is pretty cancerous, but for those of you out
there with the desire and necessary expertise and time (the last two are
what I am lacking) it is completely fixable.  Needs new bottom edge all the
way around.

	Also, I have an airconditioning unit, complete minus compressor, and an
automatic tranny (complete) that I pulled off my '73.  The Tranny is NOT
vacuum shifted, but governor shifted.

	Ok, so if anyone out there is interested in anything at all, please p-mail
me and I'll send photos and tighter descriptions.  Like I said, I would like
for the whole bus to go to someone, BUT!  I would sell just the interior, or
just the body.  What I would like to avoid, however, is ending up selling
each individual piece.  The space it occupies needs to be replaced with hay.
Thank you all.
