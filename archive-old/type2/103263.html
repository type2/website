Subject: Re: [T2] 71 Westy

I have
&gt;&gt;found a 71 Westy that is in decent shape.  But wonder if there are any
&gt;&gt;peculiarities to this year model that I need to be aware of.  Any info
&gt;&gt;appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;I assume you know that this is a Beetle powered bus, has the weaker 
&gt;steering system, and the non-removable drums (requires drum and hubs to be 
&gt;removed for brake work)?
&gt;
More importantly I think I would be the mention of Disc Brakes. They are 
disc
arent they? SO you have disc brakes that are different then the brakes of 
your 78.
My point is that the type 1 engine will be dealing with the vacuum for them. 
Make
sure its connected.
