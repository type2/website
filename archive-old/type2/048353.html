Subject: [T2] 82  AC Vanagon gas smell

List

Finished the AVP engine installation and it went very well. The engine runs
fine, has a couple of hundred miles on it, but still runs a little warm.

First snow this morning, so I used the heater/defroster (has been used with
the new engine with no problem). Twice on 5 mile trip I smelled RAW gas
through the defroster vents. All hoses in engine compartment are tight and
there is no gas smell in engine area or under the westi with engine off or
running. Rear heater ducts and hoses were checked and tightened last
weekend.

Any ideas on a source and correction for my new problem?

Thanks for any ideas.

Bill
