Subject: Re: [T2] AIRS--Road Trippers need help in Boise

I never knew the name of the place or the exact location. I just made note
of it along the way as passing scenery. It would stand to reason that it
would be located near a fairly large city, so it probably is closer to
Spokane.. Thanks for tipping us off as to the name. Jan B

&gt; Would we be taking about Spauldings up by Spokane?

&gt;
&gt; &quot;I definitely think it is off Hwy 90, on the north side of the
&gt; road, probably
&gt; somewhere between Pasco and Spokane. I remember noticing it and
&gt; seeing acres
&gt; and acres of cars.&quot;
