Kevin Roberts featured:
&gt;  A guy starts driving right on my tail.   He had two free lanes to 
&gt;pass, but no, he had to tail-gate a VW  bus!  I almost slammed on 
&gt;the brakes just to teach him a  lesson.

	A near-equivalent is (given that your lights aren't already 
on) to switch on your sidelights.  The type of ignoramus who would 
tailgate you will not know the difference between your tail-lights 
and your (brighter) stoplights.  S/he will drop back, at least 
temporarily.


&gt;The Chattanooga Choo-Bop won't hold the road like my Jags

	- perhaps not; but unlike them it won't be in the garage for 
repairs most of the time
