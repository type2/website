Hi, Brian--

See how many votes you get from list members for this option:

Depending on (1)your cash flow, (2) your aptitude and inclination, and (3) 
your available tools and workspace, consider buying the new engine and then 
rebuilding your old one--whether to keep as a spare, or for later sale/swap, 
or simply for the learning involved so you can join in with the rest of the 
seasoned vets when they recount rebuild advice and horror stories on the 
list.

Last year I bought one of the new Mexican engines to put in my daily driver, 
and I'm pretty satisfied with it. But if I'd had the time and a place to do 
the work, I'd like to have learned how to rebuild an engine too.

Good luck!
