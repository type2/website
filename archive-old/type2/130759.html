&gt; I reply on this feedback to make decisions about how I drive.

As many a listee (or listero, when from the southwest) has argued, the 
most important thing to do is to rebuild engines precisely to spec, 
maintain according to the technical literature, and drive as intended. 
That gets you oil pressure plus oil and head temps within limits. With 
these as measures of an initial set of conditions, gauges can indeed 
provide useful feedback.

What they can't do is be used like a medical thermometer. You can't 
arbitrarily stick one under the tongue of your engine and decide if 
it's normal or sick.
