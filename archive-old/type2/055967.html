Subject: empi exhaust systems

does anyone out there make an extractor system with the correct air riser
tubes and heater boxes?  after reading bob hoovers sermons and then looking
at the homemade muffler on my 69 westy, i would like to find something
&quot;more correct.&quot;  take a look at page 29 of bill fishers how to hotrod vw
engines; it has a picture of a engine equiped engine with this sort of
header/extractor.  im stumped as to where to get one like this.  never seen
one in real life actually.  i would ideally to have 2 of them, one for the
69 westy and one for the 72 super.  anyone out there have one/seen one/know
where one can be found?
