So many people giving their opinions, I guess it might be a good idea to
see what VW had to say about it. In my owners' manual, my 1974 Westy with
an 1800cc engine has a listed TOP SPEED of 79 mph. Right under that
information, it gives the CRUISING SPEED for my bus. It also is 79mph. 
What does this tell us? It tells ME that VWs were designed to be driven
at their limits, for hours on end.  When I cruise at 70mph (with the
comfortable help of my cruise control) my rpm's are at 3900.  Those
things are all facts, not opinions. 
Here comes the opinion part:
It seems to me that if our buses were designed to be driven for hours on
end at an rpm greater than 4000, using that rpm as a shift point would be
perfectly fine.  I personally shift between 3500 and 4000, usually
sticking to the lower end, but sometimes merging with traffic, passing a
dumptruck that's spilling rocks or whatever requires me to rev it higher.
 Some people like to shift at 2500, and while I think they run the risk
of lugging the engine, that's up to them. I would rather trust VW by
keeping my rpm's high and not feeling ashamed because I cruise on the
interstate at 70mph.
