Subject: Re: [T2] Question about parking lights


David,

Federally mandated &quot;side marker&quot; lights.  Unlike the rears which are close 
to the ground and seperate, the fronts are in the lens housing itself.

Cheers ,dave

&gt; Today I had the rapid-blinker noise that indicates a burnt-out bulb.  The 
&gt; right front parking light (orange, roughly-square high-mounted one for 
&gt; 73-79 busses) had not one but two bulbs under the lens cover.  The large 
&gt; one was an 1157 with two filaments, which I understand.  The small one had 
&gt; no markings on it but it was also burnt out.  I bought all new bulbs and 
&gt; installed them (for the small one, I got the package marked &quot;indicator 
&gt; bulbs&quot; that had the highest numerical identifier) and then tested out the 
&gt; lights.
&gt; 
&gt; It appears that the small light works in unison with the weaker(for lack of 
&gt; a better term) filament on the 1157.  That is, they both go on when the 
&gt; parking lights are on and both go off when the parking lights are off.  The 
&gt; blinker of course only affects the stronger filament of the 1157.
&gt; 
&gt; I guess my question is this:  Why is the small bulb even there?  It seems 
&gt; to never be on by itself and therefore redundant.  Someone please tell me, 
&gt; I'm dying of curiosity!
