&gt; A quasi-mechanic friend of mine once told me that this cream colored substance
&gt; was detergent that is found in motor oil and suggested non-detergent type
&gt; oil...Can anyone corfirm or deny this???

Wrong! It's water in the oil, emulsified into the oil by all the moving
parts in the engine. And unless you've been trying to restage the old Doyle
Dane Bernbach floating-Bug ad with your Bus (DDB never said a Bus would
float, and it probably won't), you probably got it from condensation.

In this day and age, where are you even supposed to find non-detergent oil?

Oh yeah, speaking of oil...I know everyone here uses Castrol, Valvoline or
Mobil 1 in their engines, so this isn't for us, but warn your grandma about
checking the SAE service on the oil she may find in the supermarket. I was
in a supermarket the other day, waiting on my wife, and happened upon the
automotive section. They had a strange brand of oil sitting there at an
insane cheap price, so I picked up a bottle and turned it over. &quot;Exceeds API
Service SA.&quot; I think Oil of Olay exceeds API Service SA.
