Subject: Stretcheies, and strange vanagons

There is a stretch bay window bus that I see accasionally outside the 
hospital where wifey works. Haven't crawled under it, [hospital security gets 
a little squirrelly 'bout stuff like that...] but from the outside, it looks 
factory made. One sliding door, extra glass panel.  Tre cool.
On another note, I saw today in Sarasota Fl. a mid 80's vanagon on steroids. 
As I walked by it, everything said hightop vanagon. Sheet metal, wheels, door 
handles, seats, dash, EVERYTHING looked just like a vanagon....except it 
seemed a little wider...and a touch longer...so I went for a closer look, and 
the front end says 
Mercedes Benz 600E. the side door was open, so I looked in...engine between 
the seats, and a flat floor back to two side hinged doors. Otherwise, the 
interior was very VW-ish. No one around to ask.  Are any of you familiar with 
these?? Is this a hybrid, or did VW makes these for Benz, or what??
