Subject: Re: [T2] windshield replacement

VW didn't introduce those &quot;alligator teeth&quot; and change the inner lip
appropriately until 1970.  An enhanced &quot;safety&quot; feature introduced by VW,
but not required by the USDOT, they were more of a pain than an ehancement.
When I was in full swing manufacturing OE Style and Cal Look Window Rubber
in the late 70s thru the 90s, I only made my rubber cross-section
(profile) for the non-alligator teeth style flanges, which worked just
fine.  Go ahead and rip-'em out, clean the flange surface, coat with some
rust inhibiting paint or tar, and install the seal BD shipped to you.

How they got on your buddy's 64 is a mystery, maybe they were retrofitted.
Having changed windshield seals on a 56, 59, 62, 64, 67, 68 and a 69 Bug, I
never encountered them.  Now my buddy's 72 Super Beetle, he had 'em, but we
ripped 'em out to install the OE style (Brazil-made) seal.  Didn't encounter
any problems with the installation.

&gt; folks, i was helping a buddy today put a new
&gt; windshield in a 64 bug. The rubber we got (from Bus
&gt; Depot) doesn't want to go over the little teeth on the
&gt; inside of the wind frame. Huh? We don't have the
&gt; original or previous rubber to be able to check to
&gt; make sure the rubber is the same.  I can see that
&gt; these teeth would keep the windshield in place in case
&gt; or accicent. Do i rip those teeth out, which is what i
&gt; did on my 70 bug in the late 80s.
&gt; thanks
