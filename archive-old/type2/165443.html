&gt; &gt; Do you think you got the valves adjusted correctly? Valves not closing
&gt; &gt; all the way could cause a problem like that.

&gt; have readjusted them loose, tight, very loose, very tight and everywhere
&gt; in between!!  got the other 3 cyl right on the first try,. besides these
&gt; are hyd lifters they work if they are even close....and I hear the leak
&gt; when compresion testing...

I think that you have diagnosed the problem.  The valve is not seating for
some reason.  Might be a tight stem, bent valve, poor valve grinding job,
poor lapping job, etc.  Unfortunately, the only way to tell is to pull the
head and look.  Pour 95% isopropyl alcohol into the combustion chamber
in the head and see where it leaks.
