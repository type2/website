Subject: Re: [T2] Yikes - Paint is Expensive

&gt;  I keep expecting the EPA to
&gt; lock us amateurs out of painting our own vehicles.

I am amazed that we do not need to be licensed to buy this stuff.  It  
will kill you if you are not careful.  I half expect birds to be  
falling out of the sky all around when I paint outside.

I read a story about a guy who painted his bus in his barn.  Came  
back later and found thousands of bugs and spiders that fell into the  
paint, probably did a better job fumigating than Orkin is allowed to do.

At some point, we may become disallowed to do this without a proper  
paint booth, etc.  I was able to drive a forklift, now, to do so, I  
have to take a class and test and get a forklift drivers license or  
risk a $5000 fine if caught.  This paint is probably as dangerous as  
driving a forklift.
