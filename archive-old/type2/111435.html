and as far as what to do...
give it a good tune up...\
change oil and filter,

&gt;Greetings from Okla. City,
&gt; I've just purchased a '75 bus. The body has no rust, inside or out. It has
&gt;a single carbeurator and std. transmission. It wouldn't start when I looked
&gt;at it and the PO said it had a bad alternator and that it had been sitting
&gt;about 9 months, but I could turn the engine (slowly) with a jump. Well, I
&gt;towed it off for $300. It's got alot of oil on the bottom of the engine and
&gt;there was oil in the grass under it. I filled it up with oil ( a quart)and
&gt;changed the starter and battery cable and it started right up. I checked the
&gt;compression (cold) and got 115 lbs. on 1&amp;2 and 120 lbs. on 3&amp;4. I drove it
&gt;around the block (slowy) and it shifted good. I then parked it and am
&gt;wondering what are some recommendations on things to check/adjust before i
&gt;really take it for a spin? Does it have hyd. lifters? Can I test the
&gt;alternator in the bus? Sorry for the long post. I'll try to stick to the
&gt;library and archives when possible. I heard there's a picnic this weekend
&gt;and some busses are coming in from Tulsa and I'd like to take mine if
&gt;possible. 
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
&gt;Dan, the new guy,
&gt;'75 bus
