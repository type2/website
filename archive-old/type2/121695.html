Not necessarily. Maybe I am not awake yet this morning, but I am not 
sure what &quot;brake cleaner&quot; (or &quot;break cleaner&quot; [sic]) is. But if it is 
the same as brake fluid, this is a well-known paint remover. Rustoleum 
stands up to oil just fine. I'm not so sure about gasoline, but how 
much gasoline are you planning to splash around       there?

Powder coating isn't a bad idea -- I am planning to have all my tin 
powder coated -- but spray paints like rustoleum do just fine if they 
are properly applied and either baked a little or given time to cure 
without getting banged around.
