Subject: CARBS!! to SCOTT

Hey Scott

I would like to buy your carbs. I would like to make an offer but have no idea how much they are worth. I want to convert my 73 single carb modification BACK to the double carbs...I really could use this b/c you have all the goodies that go with them.

Drop me a line at andrewlk_at_yep_dot_com directly (not via list) and I will give you my home number!

Peace
Andrew
