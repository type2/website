&gt; The point is sir you have gained public acclaim and are being read thru-out
&gt;the civilized world.

&lt;insert loud applause&gt;

&gt;
&gt; Kind of makes you feel like Hemmingway, don't it?

like who?

&gt;
&gt; NO - I didn't give them your name or address.
&gt;
&gt; I put my name on it :-)

My attorney will be in touch;-)

&gt;
&gt; There was another guy on the list who was going to get some tales
&gt;from a friend who had spent &quot;20 years in the bush with a vw van&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; We are still waiting dude, or are you just shining us on?
&gt;
I would definitely love to read these exploits; has there been any progress
getting them published on the Web Nate?
