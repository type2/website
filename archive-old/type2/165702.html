If you're gonna stick with VW aircooled, you're
already &quot;at the top!&quot; That was the final stage of
evolution in those engines. Next was Vanagon version
of same engine with different fuel injection system -
no advantage to switch - and then the water-boxers.
You will likely see a vast improvement in rebuilding
your current engine though. If you have current engine
rebuilt you are getting what you have taken care of
all these years only &quot;renewed&quot; whereas a rebuilt
bought outright will get you somebody else's stuff -
possibly from multiple somebody elses and no control
over the execution of the rebuild.

Conversion, such as I have (Subaru) is a tremendous
improvement, but I cannot recommend it unless you are
capable of doing your own work. -BaH
