&gt; Do some research, Mike.  Look at Type2_dot_com in the
&gt; library and maybe even in the classifieds...

I did a little researching, and came to the conclusion that it's a '77 (T2)
Transporter.  Which apparently can also be referred to as a &quot;Microbus&quot; or a
&quot;Bay&quot; (it doesn't have the split windshield).  It's not a camper-style; a
Westfalia or Adventurewagon.

This page has a restored bay that looks exactly like our '77 from the
outside, paint included: http://www.luckystarz_dot_com/bus/

In the course of fixing &quot;him&quot; up, I'm going to make reproductions of all of
the light lenses, front and back, as well as any knobs, handles, bumpers,
etc..  I do it for a living anyway, and it might turn out that some items
might be resellable.

Besides, it's sort of neat to have a tail lens go to pieces, and have a new
one ready for it the same day. [grin]  (And the resins that I use are
tougher than the plastic that the original lenses are made of.)

So, let's try this sig...
