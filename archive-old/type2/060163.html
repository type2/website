Subject: Re: Oil everywhere: from where?

     This is just another example of why I said in a recent post that
VW's are a PITA. I've seen more things break on them then any other
vehicle I've ever run. Most engines when the rings get worn, you can go
for a long ways -- sure, maybe you don't get great power or milage, but
they still go. My '81 was just like yours -- started and ran great, good
power, just blew oil like crazy. It's because the of the flat four
config, I think, the crankcase is so shallow, and there is just so
little room in there to spare. Or maybe the breather is just too small
-- whatever happened to those breather vents on the valve covers they
used to have?
       Not that I'm going to give up driving -- and fixing, eternally
fixing, fixing, fixing -- my bus, of course, but that's reality as I see
it.
