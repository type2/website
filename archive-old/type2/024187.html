Muir gave me the courage to actually work on my bus.  My ex-boyfriend used to
do all the work on the bus (we owned it together) but when we split, I got the
bus.  I was getting pressure everywhere to sell it because, being a women, and
I'd never do any work on it.  I almost did sell it.  If felt I didn't know
enough to keep it running.  My beloved bus!  Without Muir's book, who knows
where she would be now, I try not to think about it.

Thanks-
Michelle
