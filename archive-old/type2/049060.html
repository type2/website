Subject: [T2] 69 bus for sale in Southern California

Unfortunately I have to sell my 69 bus.  The bus has a 1600 single port with
alternator and a remote mounted spin on oil filter.  The interior is
complete with the center seat but the upholstery is pretty worn on most
seats.  The body is in very good condition.  Email me directly for pictures.
I'm asking $1800.00.  Registration is current.

John
69 type 2, 73 type 2 Westy, 69, type 1.
