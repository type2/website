Subject: 3 post relay?

I found this relay mounted on the frame near the starter.  I had assumed
it 
was a relay installed to help with the common hot start problems in a
bus. 
The wires had been cut to it and it looks like the previous owner had 
installed a bosch hot start relay, and abandoning this one. I got around
to 
removing it awhile back. On the bottom of the relay is stamped
&quot;power 6V&quot; ... 6 volt? 
Why would they have installed a 6 volt relay, is this for something
else?
