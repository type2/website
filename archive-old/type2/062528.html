Subject: 78 Brakes: ATE? Girling?

I'm in the process of replacing the front disc brake pads on our 78. A
local FLAPS actually had the pads in stock ($12 for the set of four). Two
questions:

1. How hard is it supposed to be to remove the two pins from the caliper?
It seems like it's harder than it should be. The pins are really resistant
to moving. I already bent one pin punch.

2. I thought I would replace the pins along with the brake pads. At the
FLAPS, they had a listing for a &quot;Girling-Type Brake&quot; and an &quot;ATE-Type
Brake,&quot; both for a 78 bus. The Girling-Type was the only kind for which the
supplier had a pin listed, so I ordered a set of four (about $5 total).
Neither Muir nor Bentley mentions these types of brakes (at least as far as
I can tell). In the listing of the brake parts for the different types of
brakes, some of the parts had the same number (for example, the pads were
the same) and some had different numbers (for example, the pins, which had
no listing for the ATE type). What is the significance of the different
types of brakes? What does &quot;Girling&quot; mean? ATE?

Thanks, as usual,
