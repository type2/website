Subject: Re: [T2] Type 4 flywheels

&gt; I am trying to understand the difference between the flywheels for the
&gt; type 4 engines. I know the early transmissions need to have the
&gt; bellhousing clearanced to receive the larger flywheels, but I
&gt; originally thought the flywheels were larger in diameter, but since
&gt; all the flywheels seem to work with the AT starter,

I believe the 228mm flywheel only works with the SR87 starter.

&gt; it would seem the
&gt; diameters are the same. I am thinking therefore that it is just the
&gt; reach of the flywheel into the bellhousing that is different, which
&gt; would seem to agree with what I have seen in the picture showing the
&gt; different lengths of the starter shafts.

When you hear a flywheel is 210/215/228mm that measurement is  
essentially the width of the clutch disk and pressure plate.

Here are some photos:
