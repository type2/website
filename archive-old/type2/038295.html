&gt;After the last engine removal/reinstallation my accelerator cable seemed to
shrink in length, so I figured it must be snagged somewhere along the way.
While trying to remove it today it has become really stuck good.  I have
about 3 feet of it our of the front of the bus, and it won't come out any
further, nor will it go back in.  What to do now?

Should be able to crawl under and see it snagged somewhere way up in 
there..most prolly on the rear end of the guide-tube.(at least that's where 
I snagged 2 just yesterday :(

Good luck..
