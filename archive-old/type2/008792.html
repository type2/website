&gt; &gt; Couldn't find this in the archives, so i figured i'd ask...
&gt; &gt; Just got a 74' that has been sitting with -some- gas in the tank
&gt; with the cap on and everything sealed for about 3, maybe 4 years. 
&gt; Needless to say, the carb was all gummed up and when i pulled the
line
&gt; off the tank, the gas was all dark and smelly like it gets when it
&gt; breaks down.
&gt; &gt; First of all, i know i should pull the tank to have it dipped and
&gt; probably will later.  For right now, a friend told me deisel fuel is
a
&gt; pretty good solvent for getting that old gas out. Cuss/discuss?
&gt; &gt; TIA,


On this tank cleaning issue, I have taken the tanks out of the Bus and
tossed in a large hand full of gravel from my driveway, added a gallon
or 2 of water and then I shake well. The gravel brakes loose all the
crap that is in the tank and cleans out the gunk that wants to stick to
the bottom. I then dump out the gravel and flush once or twice. Its
cheap, easy and safe. Oh ya, air dry in the sun for a few hours.
