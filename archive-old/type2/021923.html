Is the splitty still for sale in San Diego?? I could use another project and

my old man lives in Escondido.  I live in Germany right now and it seems
that 
most of the quality buses are making the trip back from the U.s and not the 
other way around.  If you find a deal then jump on it cause they are dying
as 
fast as 90 year old men.
Peace Out
