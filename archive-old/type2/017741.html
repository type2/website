   No, there is no gasket between the halves. Don't use Permatex either. I
currently have the fan shroud off my '78 Westy, it does come apart, (I had to
seperate the halves to remove the condo mice had built in there). There are a
couple locating pins at about 8:00 o'clock and 1:30 positions as you look at
the shroud. They can be a bit crusty (mine were) and cause the pins to stick in
their holes. I used some penetrant, let it sit a bit, then, every so gently,
going round and round, carefully pried the halves apart with a putty knife.
Just make sure you've removed all the screws...I didn't find all of them until
I had cleaned all the greasy crap off the outside. Careful with that dipstick
tube too, after the pins are free you kind of follow the angle of the dipsticvk
tube to complete the seperation process.
Hope this helps;
