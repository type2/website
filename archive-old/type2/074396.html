Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Replacing fuel line hints

Whoa!  That's still cheaper than the german stuff!  I paid 40 bux for my
line.  Is it rated for fuel?  And do they have an internet site or do
mail order?

&gt; &gt; &gt; pricy but don't need much.  (I think my fuel line is rated at something
&gt; &gt; &gt; like 5,000psi or so)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; uhhhh.. bob, I don't think that's enough.. You really should have gone
&gt; &gt; for the 6,000 psi hose...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; hahah :) :)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; How much did it cost?
&gt; 
&gt; well they gave me a discount because I bought some roll ends,
&gt; if I recall it was about $2 a foot or so.  or about $20 to do all the
&gt; hoses
