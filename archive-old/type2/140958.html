Subject: UV Leak Kits?

Anyone ever use on of those UV leak kits to detect oil leaks in there Bus or
perhaps cooling system of their other driver. I've got my T4 motor that I
can't find the leak in it for nothing.  Now my 96 Intrepid has a coolant leak
that I can't find the source, garage didn't either after $150.

Any thought of buying a kit from eastwood that would handy with bus leaks

Just wanted some opinions if available
