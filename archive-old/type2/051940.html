Subject: Re: [T2] Friday Bus Poll

keep em comin folks:)  jeff brought up a good point so
i will clarify between b and c.  a &quot;B&quot; would be a nice
unrestored example that looks quiet nice, still
shines, minimal flaws, where a &quot;C&quot; would be more of a
bus that still goes well and looks pretty good but
might have a couple rust spots here or there or some
faded paint etc. basically a decent driver that has
seen a little wear and tear over the years.  i think
ill have my work cut out for me but it should be fun
going through all these.

&gt; &gt; You need another category in here.  B&amp;C seem
&gt; pretty
&gt; &gt; similar, and 
&gt; &gt; there's a wide gap between C&amp;D.
