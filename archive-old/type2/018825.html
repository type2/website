Tom Wilson says to be sure to replace the rubber trim strip that goes
around the outer edge of the windage tray.  You can see in in the
photograph.  This does not come in any seal kit, as far as I know; it
certainly didn't come in the seal kit I got.  

QUESTION: Does anyone know if this edge trim strip is necessary?

My guess is that it keeps it from
rattling against the case and wearing metal away (like the tin does on
the outside of the case).  On the other hand, even with the stock seal,
I'd be worried that it would fall off and ....

Of course, I could just leave the windage tray out.  Most type IV
engines don't have one, on my understanding.  Last time I built this
engine, I didn't have a windage tray on hand; but I suspect that I may
have used the special oil pickup that goes with the windage tray (I have
no idea where it came from, or how it would have gotten into my
collection of type IV engine parts), which has a hole in the top for the
bolt to the windage tray.  (I'm not sure if it's the one I used, because
when I cleaned the engine parts yesterday, I tossed in a bunch from
other engines, and only noticed the hole -- and different length tube,
BTW -- in a side to side comparison with another, which I'm pretty sure
came from another case, because I remember noticing a manufacturing
peculiarity on it.)  This would cause a pretty serious loss of oil pump
suction, I'd wager.

QUESTION #2: does anyone know where oil starvation shows up first?  

I'm betting it's not at the crankshaft?  If my experience breaking down
oil starved
engines is any help, I'd say it shows up most noticably at the camshaft
bearings.  Does anyone care to confirm or confute this?

QUESTION #3: Can you have an engine that is being starved for oil, but
not running hot?  In the winter, even?

No temp guage to confirm this, but the dipstick didn't feel hot.

QUESTION #4: Should wear in the cam bearings and the crankshaft split
bearing be even all around, or is it typical for it to show up more in
the on the left and right hand side of the engine (i.e. in the middle of
each half bearing)?  

This last question pertains to my use of Gasgacinch as my case parting
line sealant.  On breakdown, I discovered a thin film build between the
case halves.  Not much, but .... (this product was recommended for this
application and sold to me by Vee Village in K.C., MO, back when I built
this engine.  They said that they use it to seal the case halves on
their rebuilds -- which, in hindsight, should have been interpreted as
evidence against its use for this purpose.
