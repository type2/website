Subject: Adjusting dual Solex carbs

I spent a few hours yesterday adjusting my carbs and have great
acceleration now. However, no idle when the engine is cold. So I need
help figuring out the correct idle adjustment procedure. 

The catch is that my carbs are 36-40 PDSIT without the central idle
system and (deliberately) disabled chokes. That means that the idle
adjustment for stock carbs (32-34 PDSIT 2/3) outlined in Bentley does
not apply due the lack of the central idle system.

Has anyone experience with these carbs? They came off a Euro spec 411
with an AT engine. A google search indicates that BMW 2000s used one of
these carbs.
How do I adjust idle speed? Is there an idle bypass screw that I have
not found yet? I do not want to mess with the throttle plate gap for
idle speed adjustment.

Any hints, links, or diagrams are greatly appreciated.
