&gt;acknowledge, quite clearly, that the T2 is not my

&gt;It is cold-blooded and blalky at start-up

Hey, I'm in PDX also and my Bus is my only vehicle. It's just as dependable as
anything else on the road, as long as I keep gas in it.  Sure, the coil died and left 
me on the side of I-5 just north of Rose Quarter a few months ago, but parts 
failure can happen to *any* vehicle.  I've sold parts for &amp; worked on enough 
&quot;common&quot; vehicles to know that much. =)

I'm with you on the cold-to-drive and cold-blooded at startup, though .. at least 
until I get the FI reinstalled (damn P.O.) and check (&amp; probably replace) the main 
heat tube.  I'll get back to y'all once that's squared away.
