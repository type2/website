I have decided to toss in my two Lincolns before this thread really gets old
(I may be too late).  Anyway,  I installed the VDO sender in the sump of my
78 2.0L and the plate looked too small, but it worked fine.  Be very, very
careful when drilling the hole in order to give the nut enough room to clear
the flange on the plate, but close enough to lock against the edge.  Do this
by placing the nut inside the plate where it will lock in place and then
make a mark for the hole.  Mine is close enough so that one flat side of the
hex nut rests against the flange and locks it in place to keep from turning.
I then installed the sender by screwing it into the sump plate with the hex
nut locked in place. The sump plate is so small it would be almost
impossible to ever leave enough clearance to actually get a wrench or socket
on the hex nut.  The sender and gauage work great and I can't imagine life
without them. Good luck.

&gt;used a nut and lock washer to hold it on. I
