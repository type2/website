&gt;Hi, Listers,
&gt;
&gt;Will the stock tin give sufficient cooling when the engine isn't sealed in 
&gt;the engine bay? I have fans that I could play on the engine, but I don't
know 
&gt;where to aim them where they wouldn't negate the work the tin is supposed to 
&gt;be doing. Experienced suggestions are much appreciated.
&gt;


If you can devise a tube to seal over the fan screen and run the end out
away from the hot air coming off the running motor so you deliver nothing
but ambient cool air, you should be ok. Just be sure the spark plug and oil
sender seals are in place. What you must prevent is hot air rising from
below and entering the fan. Hot air is not good for cooling and a new motor
first run will run quite a bit hotter than a broke in motor. However,
running on a stand without putting a load on the motor simply will not seat
the rings. You must put a load on the motor to squeeze the rings against
the cylinders to hone them in and cut the cross hatch burrs down.
