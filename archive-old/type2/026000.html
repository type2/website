Coating the inside of the hub would be fine for rust prevention, but packing
the inside is a waste of time and money, you are going to have to clean all
that back out to clean all the small particles that could re-enter the
bearing causing damage.

I should have been more specific on the over packing statement.  Being a
teacher, in the summers I used to work as a mechanic for industry.  I don't
think on a VW the seals are tight enough, but in industry, many high speed
shaft bearings can be overpacked which can cause excessive heat build up
that can ruin the bearing.  Call down to your local industrial bearing
outlet and ask them about it.

The front disk brakes on a bus do get very hot under heavy braking
conditions and that heat can cause the grease to heat to a point it expands
the grease and pushes it past the seal and dust cap.

All this talk about front wheel bearings, does everyone know that VW
suggested packing the REAR wheel bearings every 30,000 miles?  Those rear
wheel bearings take more of a beating than the front ones do!  They carry
more weight and have the torque of the drive train added to them.

&gt; I disagree on *mildly* packing the hub.  I've seen many unpacked hubs that
&gt; had enough rust in them to ruin the bearings.  Everything in that
&gt; environment needs to be at least coated with grease to prevent corrosion.  I
&gt; pack my hubs near full with Valv-Moly, which is not like gorilla snot and
&gt; have never had a problem.
&gt; 
&gt; What application have you experienced where too much grease has ruined a
&gt; bearing on a VW?  I'm gonna call ya on that one big boy.

&gt;&gt; In some applications too much grease can create so much pressure it can ruin
&gt;&gt; the bearing.  As for the front wheels, it just gets pushed past the seals
&gt;&gt; and dust cap.  I hope you used high temperature grease made for disk brakes.
