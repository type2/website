Subject: Re: [T2] High-lift jack?

First, let me say that a high lift jack isn't
what you need.  This is a high lift jack:  

http://www.hi-lift_dot_com/casting.htm

They are very useful offroad both for lifting
your vehicle out of soft sand or mud or whatever,
and pulling your vehicle out of the obstacle once
the vehicle is lifted (a poor mans winch). 
You'll see them on the back of serious Jeeps and
Landcruisers, and maybe on my bus for baja trips.
 

You can get by with only one floor jack.  You
just need lots of 4x4's or railroad ties to crib
the vehicle and engine.  You lift the vehicle,
use jacks and cribbing to hold it.  Then may have
to use cribbing to make a higher platform for the
jack, lower the engine some, crib the sides of
the  engine so that you can remove the jack, then
get another bite with the jack.... repeat.  

In auto extrication classes, they taught us to
stack the cribbing with two going one way, then
the next two going and so on.  The end result
looks like a stacked Lincoln Log tower.  

Needless to say, be very, very careful.  If you
disconnected everything prior to lifting the bus,
you should be able to pull the engine without
getting any part of you body under the vehicle or
engine.  

Extra jacks stands (which I never trust alone,
I've seen too many times that the vehicle shifts
while falling and misses the tiny area on the top
of the stands), extra cribbing and a second floor
jack wouldn't really cost that much, would it?  

&gt;I have a sneaking suspicion that getting the new
engine in is gonna be a lot harder!!

Not really.  Just don't forget the clutch
alignment tool.  Take your time.  

&gt;I think that installing a removeable apron would
be a lot more work

I really like my removeable apron.  Of course, it
came from the factory that way.  I remove it and
some of the engine tin even when doing minor
jobs, like exhausts.  It makes life much easier. 
No jacks=stands, no lifting the bus 4 feet in the
air.  Just unbolt the engine, support the tranny,
slide the floorjack underneath, and pull the
engine.
