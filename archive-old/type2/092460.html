Subject: Set screws in heads

I have a '74 with the the original 1.8l engine in it. It was 'rebuilt' by
a fellow list member right before I bought it (I helped him reinstall the
engine). It's been great for 12000 miles except for one annoying problem:

There are two set screws that go into the head (I assume on both heads,
but I only have this problem on the driver's side of the engine). There
are holes just fore and aft the intake manifolds. The set screw 'drops'
into the hole at an angle for about 4 inches and threads into the head. I
have no idea what these screws are for but they keep coming out. When they
are out exhaust comes out of the head into the engine compartment (with
the expected results: loud noise and cooling issues).

I've tried loctite without good results. The first time this happened the
screws went back in easily but now I can't seem to get them to thread. The
threads on the screw on the back of the engine were goobered and I got
them cleaned up. I'm afraid the threads in the head are goobered as well.
Unfortunately, I can't get a tap for it because the shaft of the tap needs
to be more than four inches long. To make matters worse, the threads are
M10 x 1.00 pitch. It's nearly impossible to find anything in that size.

Any ideas what these set screws are? Any ideas how I could possibly fix
this? I thought I could find something with tapered threads or just use a
really long M10x1.00 bolt..

-Eric
