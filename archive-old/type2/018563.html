I, too, have been using the Fluoramics, Inc. TUFOIL since '83 in my vehicles and
have not yet found a reason to stop using it.  I noticed an increased idling rpm
after first use of product.  My guess is those using synthetic oil would not notice
a change in idle.  Cost for my last gallon of the product was $135 USD.

&gt; with 135lbs compression.   Is it TUFOIL (aPTFE additive that's been proven
&gt; to extend the life of warehouse machines) or dumb luck or sensible
&gt; driving??  Obviously hasn't hurt it!  Seeya at Litchfield!
