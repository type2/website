&gt; I had the same scenario in my last home. Basement Garage, I could get the
&gt; Westy in there with low tires. But forget about most major work. Most major
&gt; work requires the bus to be jacked up.

well he might have some room to lift a little since his problem seems to
be the location of the entrance more than the height of the garage.
