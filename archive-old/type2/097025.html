Subject: RE: [T2] Synthetic oil

I also went with Mobile1 15W50 after the break in.  Before and after the
rebuild, if I was running at 65 on a 85+ degree day and let the engine
idle while coasting down a hill or just pulling over for that
matter....my oil light would flicker to the beat of the engine.  Before
the rebuild I ran SAE 40 and afterwards used 20W50.  Since I have
changed to the full synthetic 15W50, my temps stay much cooler (220_at_65 /
230_at_75) and the oil light does not come on anymore.  Now, I do not have
an oil pressure gauge so I am not certain.  My question is... Was my oil
pressure dropping do to the higher temps of the oil?  Sometimes this
would occur even if the oil temps were not all that high. Say, around
230 or so.  This was with the petroleum based oil.  I have had my oil
temps go up to 250 since I changed to the synthetic but the oil light
has never flickered.  What am I missing here?  It has been my
understanding that as oil temps rose, oil pressure dropped.  Do I have
this wrong?  But, if the oil temps were 230, why would the light still
flicker. Or, does this have nothing to do with the oil pressure and I
just need to go to bed because its too late for me to think right?
Thanks for the help.
