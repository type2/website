Any club that was that snooty personally I would not waste 
my time with, who needs that kind of attitude?? To me the 
hobby is supposed to be fun not a country club etc.

&gt; Yeah, Herr Zeidler from the vanagon list inquired about 
this club
&gt; quebecois and I checked out their homepage (URL is not 
handy right now,
&gt; but it's in French anyway; ask and I'll dig it up). Very 
snotty indeed; 
&gt; they even made up a fancy coat of arms and spelled out a 
small
&gt; constitution. Very cute. The guy who formed the club (the 
Founding
&gt; Father?) nominated himself as &quot;President&quot;.  :-) Now, I 
find it odd that
&gt; this Westfalia club will actually accept non-Westfalia 
conversions
&gt; (provided, however, that they're based on a VW 
transporter, have a &quot;hinged
&gt; fiberglass top&quot;, and are not homemade). 
&gt; 
&gt; Jean-Baptiste, did you actually inquire about your 
eligibility or did you
&gt; just assume you're persona westfalica non desirata from 
reading their
&gt; homepage?
