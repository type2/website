&gt; &gt; Most CV boot kits contain both bolts and serrated washers.

&gt; I bet Ron knows the answer but of the three boot kits I've seen,
&gt; Meistersatz, Febi and Lobro, none contained the metal plate which go between
&gt; every two bolts.

I've seen some that do, and some that don't.  In no case did the
replacement plates and washers look as well-made as the originals, so I
ended up using the old plates and washer with the new bolts.  I use
anti-sieze on the threads and torque them to spec with a torque wrench.
Never had one come loose yet (sound of knuckles striking wood)
