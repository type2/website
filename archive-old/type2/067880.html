Subject: Re: VW Soul (or lack thereof)

&gt; Now, though, VW sez: if you buy this you get a free prize inside! If you
&gt; buy this you get a cartoon! If you buy this your life won't be dismal!
&gt; Lookit this commercial!
&gt; 
&gt; FWIW, if I ever buy a new car it will be a Saturn. They actually run ads
&gt; featuring the Saturn Nation (&quot;Ladies! Come on in! The guy from the
&gt; factory's gonna talk!&quot;). We had a VW Nation once. Still do, but it's got
&gt; nothing to do with VWOA. We run it now, part-time.

That's so true.  I think that's why I would never own a wasser-pumper 
VW.  Apart from being actually pretty average vehicles, VW has lost 
the soul that made it unique.   My cousin just bought a Jetta last 
week.  It's a nice car, but if it is anything like past VW's/Audi's 
my family has owned, I sure wouldn't want to be driving it in 100k 
miles.  VW's seem to turn sour a lot quicker than their Japaneese 
competitors.  

My sister and her husband just bought a Saturn.  While I don't find 
their cars aestheically pleasing, it is so cool to hear her talk 
about it.  She talks about her car like I talk about my busses.  She 
gets excited.  They actually have a continuing relationship with 
their dealer--unlike many other list-members who would love nothing 
more than to go strangle their dealer because they got screwed around 
with &quot;failing head-gasket syndrome.&quot;

VWOA, R.I.P.
