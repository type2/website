Subject: Smog-free timing; synthoil
Message-ID: &lt;7tg8jd$8oo3_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

The PO of my 74 Westy (rebuilt 1800 with stock Solexes) decided he didn't like
all the smog gear, so he removed it .. when I got the bus, I strobe-timed it
to about 7.5 ATDC but it still ran like crap.  Took her to my trusty 
neighborhood mechanic who performed some sleight-of-hand with the carbs and 
told me of clogged idle cutoffs .. he then timed it to about 8 BTDC due, he
said, to the absence of smog gear.

Does this (current timing setting) seem reasonable, or am I in the process of
burning her up?  At 8 BTDC, even after plenty of warm-up, it feels like I'm
dragging a load of concrete around behind the bus, even on flat ground. 

Also -- any potential problems with shifting to synthoil at my next oil
change?  Am running with 30w at the present.  TIA.
