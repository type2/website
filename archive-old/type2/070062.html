Subject: Re: brake booster trouble

I just had this problem a couple of weeks ago and replaced my booster with a
junkyard special for $15.00.  I tried the same tricks you did.  Replaced all
my line, replaced my check valve, redid my rear brakes, etc. etc.  It seems
some how water gets into that booster and rusts the diaphram mechanism.  

Replacing the booster is really no big deal.  It's just messy with brake
fluid dripping down your arms.  I recommend looking to your local junkyards
and pulling out two or three boosters and pushing down hard where the push
rod connects to make sure you're getting real good suction.  Take the best
one you can find.  Probably will last you many years.

Also, look inside the boosters and check for the least rustiest.  The
junkyards here in So. Cal. are loaded with clean '68-'79 buses.  Of course
you want only '71 and later.  Probably stick close to early '70s just in case
they changed boosters on us around '75-'77--you never know.  Check the part
number of your booster and compare just in case with the ones you pull.  They
all did seem to be similar to me.  Oh yeah, test your check valve too while
you're at it.  Blow in it.  You should be able to blow in the direction in
the arrow and not the other way around.  If that's the problem pick up a
check valve that works from the junk yard for about $.50 vs $15.00 new. 

Or reverse engineer.  Remove your booster and inspect it to see if it's
rusted out. Push down hard on where the push rod connects and see if you're
getting massive suction or no suction at all.  This is the least expensive
way of checking your booster.  That way you make no financial commitment but
you can verify whether that's the problem or not.  

As I say, it's not that difficult.  Just make sure you own a set of flange
wrenches so you don't strip your connections to your brake line.  I thinks
it's 11mm that connect at the master cylinder.  Can't remember.

Good luck but please take this route first before you spend $300.00 plus.
