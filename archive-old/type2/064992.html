Amen.  I would add that CHT also varies as the inverse of engine RPM,
because of the amount of air being blown over the head.
&gt;
&gt;Oil Temp seems to be much more dependent on RPMs.  On my single cab
&gt;there seems to be a &quot;sweet spot&quot; or &quot;threshold&quot; where at a certain
&gt;RPM the oil temp really shoots up quick.  Oil temp below this
&gt;threshold also seems to be more dependant on ambient temperature
&gt;(which makes sense, since cooler air will be able to transfer more
&gt;heat from the oil cooler).

Amen again.
&gt;
&gt;So I don't think these two temps will give you the answer you are
&gt;looking for.  For an oil to meet these claims, it would have to be
&gt;able to absorb more heat from the engine than other oils and be
&gt;able to transfer more heat to air at the oil cooler.  To my way of
&gt;thinking (and I am *no genius* at thermodynamics) these properties
&gt;may be mutually exclusive.

I don't think they are, but I am no genious at thermodynamics either.  I am
inclined to say that if an oil transferrs heat better, it should read
hotter than other oils.

One thing that might help is for someone to hook up their CHT gauge to
somewhere other than the cylinder head, and take before and after readings.
Maybe  on one of the case bolts on the top center of the engine.  Might be
a better indicator of actual engine temperature.
