&gt; The same size as the fuel line that goes from the fuel pump to the dual
&gt; carbs? I believe it is and it should be a 7.5 mm braided fuel line. Am I
&gt; correct?

Isn't anything besides braided fuel line available?

I thought all fuel lines in a carbed bus were 5.5mm while FI buses were 7mm
reinforced.
