Subject: 67 Rusty disagrees w/2nd gear but gets a bath anyway

Howdy!

I had some fun tonight, I took the recently running (this is a new thing for
me) 67 to the car wash tonight.  Man did I get looks!  This thing had a
layer of mildew and fungus on it that made it look like a chia-split!
Anyway, I assumed that the paint would appreciate a nice hot blast of car
wash H20.  Wrong.  Oh well, I need to paint the bus anyway.  I guess there's
not too many running splits down here in southern MD 'cuz everybody did a
double-take when they saw me in the rear-view mirror.  I actually passed
some people, I bet they feel small!

Ok, the point of all this is my tranny.  I can accelerate through all the
gears just fine, including 2nd.  The problem arises during downshifting.  If
I try to drop down to 2nd to go around a corner or just to slow down I get
this horrible &lt;gnaaakkkkkckssckhh&gt; sound and it won't go.  If I really,
really, insist it will go but it'll pop right out.  Does this sound like new
tranny time or just a long-needed adjustment?

TIA,

Bob J.
