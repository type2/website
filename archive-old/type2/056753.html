Subject: Sagging rear end and lack of power - 1978 Westphalia bus

[This message was posted by a non-subscriber. Please reply to the

I notice it looks like the rear end of my bus is sagging, can't seem to
locate the reason, what am I missing?

How do I improve the horsepower and performance of the 2000 engine, sesm
the aftermarket guys (and gals) just make parts for the bug engines?

Thanks for any help
