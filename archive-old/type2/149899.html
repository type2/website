Subject: Re: [T2] redline/weber?

Dave (and all),

I'm that guy.

I am just finishing putting together my redline/Weber IDF style MPI Fuel
Injection kit on my 1914 engine. I had the motor specially made from MOFOCO
to match the system. I haven't fired it up since my 68 DC is still in paint.

Right now I am trying to work out some issues with the brake booster vacuum
attachment and finding the right tin for my 71 Doghouse conversion.

The EFI kit seems like a very complete system and extremely simple as
Multi-port Fuel Injection goes. I did a complete upgrade and install of a
MPFI kit from HESCO (sold under Mopar Performance) on my 89 Jeep wrangler
with a 4.2L motor. The change from the old Carter Carb was like night and
supernova. I gained 80 hp and 150 ft/lbs of torque, not to mention a jump of
10mpg!!! No kidding!

The Jeep conversion took me a week, the Redline/Weber will take me a couple
afternoons. Their directions are very specific and they include a nice
CD-ROM instructional utility.

I'll post some photos of the kit. The price was $2214 with a MSD electronic
ignition and computer. I think a feller could get it cheaper if you mixed
and matched parts from CB Performance and Redline/Weber, used a Megasquirt
programmable computer and used a different dizzy setup.

I think the cost is certainly worth it, since there are fewer moving parts,
better power, better cooling (since your fuel/air ratio is constant and your
timing is computer controlled), and most importantly MUCH LOWER EMISSIONS.
It has always been hard for me to know that I am driving a polluter. Any
carb equipped vehicle pollutes, period.

My emissions went from multiple fails at the SMOG station, down to &quot;LEV&quot; or
low emissions vehicle on my Jeep after the conversion.

Anyhow I'll keep you and the list informed how the progress goes and
especially how the EFI goes. I am curious to see how it programs, how it
adjusts for Colorado's extreme altitude changes and how it adapts to
Colorado's extreme barometric pressure changes.

Jon

&gt; 
&gt; Would you please pmail me as I am very interested in hearing how it works
&gt; and how much it ended up costing.
&gt; 
&gt; Seems that on their web site, they don't want to quote prices....hmmmmust
&gt; mean I can't afford it!
