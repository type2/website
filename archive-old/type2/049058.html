Subject: Re: [T2] 1.7 Type 4 in a pre 1972 bus?

&gt; I will have to dig for that info. If it was written in a Euro publication it
&gt; might be a misunderstanding. Often in Euro publications, calender production
&gt; is noted as opposed to model year production. Therefore if a euro
&gt; publication noted that the Type4 motor was offered in 1971 they might have
&gt; been refering to the 1972 model year (begins August 1971) for which the
&gt; type1 motor was installed as standard.

A little while ago I scanned a few microfiche prints from VW. I got them
from Ron van Ness. here's the link to them:

It states that the type 4 engine was available since august 1971. I am
quite sure it was never an option before. Simply because it doesn't fit
in the engine bay. I have been registering M-plates of T2 for a couple
of years already, I never crossed a bus that had the type4-engine
option.

By the way, in Europe the type 4 engine was never a standard. It was
available as an option from august 1971 on.
 
&gt; As long as we are dicussing &quot;urban bus legends&quot; I have read and been told
&gt; that front disk brakes were optional for the 1970 model year. Any buses out
&gt; there to support this?

The parts catalog I have says discbrakes are fitted since august 1970. I
don't think it was available before that date and that this story is
indeed a &quot;legend&quot;.
	before august 1970: Not Available
	since august 1970: Standard equipment.
