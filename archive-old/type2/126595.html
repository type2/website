Subject: Re: [T2] I just stripped the interior of my 73 Westy...

Marya, if there are screws holding it in, and the heads are rusted to
the point where they're unremovable, you can use a Dremel tool and a
grinding wheel to grind off the heads. Lift the floor off the screws,
then use vice grips to remove the remants.

My floor had no screws, only the furniture bolts that went through the
floor into the metal. The only part I had difficulty with was the
little metal ring for the table leg. Those screws were horrible too. I
ended up just ripping it from the rotted wood.
