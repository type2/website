Subject: Re: [T2] Fwd: [VB] Karl's 66 Deluxe - Ouch! 

Billy, thanks for letting us know!

Karl,

Hope you are ok.  Waaay bummer about the bus.

Is everyone sure that it's a write off?  Maybe Mr. &quot;metal whiz&quot; Kelly 
could do something with it?

Cheers, dave

&gt; Sucks, but it sounds like Karl is okay, and that's the whole deal.
&gt;

&gt; Karl t-boned a car that cut in front of him. He was tossed out the driver's door and woke up 5-10 minutes later with bumps, bruises and a cut ear. 
&gt; He's standing, but the bus won't be back on the road. Guess he'll take it apart and haul the pieces down to OCTO next week.
