Subject: Special thanks

Dear friends,

     I would just like to publicly thank Mike Cross of the Norris- town PA 
area for helping me out Big Time.  He donated to me and BAM-BAM (my 73 Westy 
Jerry riG) a couple of used heat exchangers, muffler, and alternator.  I 
(Yucel Kuday) am a poor college student trying to fix up this old BUS that I 
snatched up this summer. That is why this donation was extremely helpful 
since I could not buy the new exchangers(not enough cash).  But low and 
behold the list and its members come through big time.  I have to thank Mike 
again for his generosity and kindness. Peace Brother.

I would like to also thank G. Matthew Bulley for the ideas in &quot;Heat Glorious 
Heat&quot;.

very humbled,

Yucel Kuday
