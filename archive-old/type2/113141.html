&gt; Rear disk brakes for bay windows?
&gt;
&gt; Just wondering if such a thing had ever been done..

I've not heard of that being done on a Bus but I have a friend who is into dune buggies and he's applied some of the tricks learned there to upgrade a Type 3 Ghia with rear disk brakes. I believe he used parts from a Porsche 944S.
