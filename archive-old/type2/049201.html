Subject: Re: [T2] engine ID ? help?

&gt; : 2  = this numbr means nothing, it's always a &quot;2&quot; for some reason
&gt; This number means a lot, it was alwas a 2 on 1970-1979s, it was a 1 on
&gt; 196?-1969. When they changed to this type of vin numbering system, the 4
&gt; number indicates the decade. 1 was the first decade, so a 2291 is a 69, a
&gt; 2292 is a 79. If this would have continued a 2293 would be an 89. VW used
&gt; this system on all type 1-4s

Actually, the fourth digit means something but since for the type 2 it
is always a &quot;2&quot; anyway, I didn't want to explain. In the late 1960ties
VW used a 9 digit VIN:

	239 012 345

The first three numbers stand for &quot;model&quot; (23-kombi) and &quot;modelyear&quot;
(9=1969). The rest is a serial number. Since VW made about 250.000 T2's
a year this could be anything from 000000 until 250000 or so.

&gt;From 1970 until 1979 VW used a 10 digit VIN:

	2302 012 345

The first three numbers are the same as in the sixties: &quot;model&quot;
(23-kombi) and &quot;modelyear&quot; (0=1970). The fourth digit is a &quot;2&quot; to
distinghuish it from the 1960ties numbers but in case the production
would reach 1.000.000 vehicles the &quot;2&quot; would turn into a &quot;3&quot;. This never
happened with the Transporter production but with the beetle it did.
