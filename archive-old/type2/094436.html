Subject: Re: [T2] STP Air Filters - not recommended

&gt; Second disappointment is that the STP element is only
&gt; 1&quot; thick!!!!  The Fram it replaced (how the heck did I get a Fram in
&gt; their???) was 1.5&quot; thick and the molding on the filter housing seems to be
&gt; ready for a 2&quot; thick filter

I bought my last MAHLE filter along with a 4-pack of MAHLE oil filters (you
know where ;-) and it's a perfect fit compared to the FRAM filter I had in
there before.  It's just dropped in, no adjusting, no fuss.
