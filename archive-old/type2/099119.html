Subject: Bus making a whack whack whack noise!

Last night while driving my 78 baywindow I noticed a loud noise which 
seemed to be coming from the rear which sounded almost like the noise a 
flat tire makes, like a whack, whack , whacking noise.  It didn't make 
the noise when I parked the bus and just revved the engine, and it 
didn't make it when I drove and took it out of  gear and coasted.  It 
does not seem to lack power and is running very well; I just replaced 
all the fuel lines and fuel injectors.  I have a suspricion that my CV 
joints are going because when I turn corners there is a whacking noise 
which usually is pretty guiet and diappears when I am not turning the 
wheel; if they are really shot could they  make this noise all the time, 
even if not turning the wheel?  Any ideas?  Thanks, Beth and Prudence 
the ''78 Bus.
