Subject: bench seat and tire cover in Portland OR:

Hi, folks--particularly those in the Portland OR area:

In the interest of simplifying life before I move in 
the next few weeks, I have a couple of items from my 
1970 bus I want to find a new home for: a hardshell 
spare tire cover [for the well in the rear storage 
area] and a black vinyl middle bench seat with arm rest 
and mounting hardware [a couple of tears, but basically 
in good shape].  I don't want to deal with shipping 
them [see above, re: simplifying life], so I'm hoping 
someone here in the neighborhood is interested.

Price: No cash--swap something interesting [preferably 
less bulky than those two items, which wouldn't be 
hard!] or maybe help me with a load when I move in a 
few weeks. Preference will go to someone who'd be 
interested in taking both items off my hands at the 
same time.  If interested, contact me off-list by email.

Thanks everyone.
