It's not stupid.

A teal-colored perfectly round mouse and no ADB port for an alternative.
THAT is stupid.

Okay anyway: In general the rounded-off displacements are stock, though
they are lies (er...approximations). And the to-the -cc displacements are
homemade mods, accurate to the letter, because these people are showing off.

Don't cross platforms either. The 1700 Type IV (stock in 72 and 73 but
nowadays very rare because people rebuild them as 1800s as a matter of
policy) has displacement inferior to the 1776 Type I, our favorite Type I
garage update. But the 1700 is a better, cooler, more reliable engine by
most all accounts because the Type IV is a better design. IAC it was good
enough for Ferdinand Porsche to put in his little cars.

&gt;I know this is something rather basic, but I was embarased to realize that
&gt;I don't know. Now, usually I see the engines in these busses refered to as
&gt;1600cc, 1700cc, etc. Seems straight forward enough. But in a number of
&gt;places I also see them refered to as 1641, 1776, whatever. Are these just
&gt;common oversizes? or is the nice round number (1700cc) an approximation?
&gt;What confused me the most is that my Haynes manual shows both numbers on it
&gt;as well.
