Subject: rear vent window info needed

I have my bus completely stripped out and am in the process of cleaning it
up and putting in sound deadening material. I found some rust in the floor
that I did not know about. I am patching that soon, but I was curious as to
were the rust came from. So after a big rain storm yesterday I went in the
bus to look. I was very surprised to see a lot of water on the floor. I
cannot believe this was happening before, but after seeing the rust, it must
have been. Anyway the rain looks like it is coming in near the vent window
on the back drivers side. The seal does look worn. Do new seals ever really
stop this from leaking. Can I just buy another piece of glass that is the
full length and install it in place of the vent? Will glass from the other
side work? That is what I think I would like to do. Any suggestions or
problems that I might have in doing away with the vent window?

Thanks,
Corbett
