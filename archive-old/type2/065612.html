Subject: Re: Revell of Germany, VW Bus Models???

On Thu, 10 Oct 1996 09:54:19 -0500 (CDT) you said:
&gt;I noticed in an ad in Scale Auto that Revell of Germany now makes 2 1/24th
&gt;scale VW Buses.  Could someone fill me in on this?  What Years?  What
&gt;features?  Detail? etc.  One is designated UN.  Thanks in advance,

the UN one is molded in all white plastic. it's a personnel carrier or mobile
office ... it has the middle seat and some other stuff that you can add to
make it into the UN version, but you could easily leave the extra junk off
and make a &quot;normal&quot; Vanagon out of it.  nothing toke a Camper out of it.

the other one is a FuerWehrwagen ... a fire truck. :)  no, no hoses or pumps,
but a sort of &quot;command car&quot;. it has the extra stuff to make it into a Fire
Dept. vehicle, but has the normal seating so it can be modeled into a regular
Vanagon. it is molded in RED plastic.

both are pretty neat. about $25 each. check the full page ad for Mountain
Model Supply (or something like that) up front of the magazine; it is a
place in West Virginia. they had the best prices.

i'm thinking about making one of them into a Syncro. ;)
