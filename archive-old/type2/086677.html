Subject: Re: [T2] Windshield rubber


Thank you very much for this tip. I am getting ready to remove all of my
glass and will be painting and replacing all the seals. I am really
concerned about being able to find quality seals and weatherstripping for
the doors. I have heard stories of WCM stuff not fiting well and having to
readjust doors etc.

I guess what I'm getting at here is does anyone have personal experience
with a vendor who carries quality window and door rubber for bay window
buses? Preferrably a story like... I bought my seals from ABC and they fit
perfectly, reassembly was a dream and they have not leaked in 10
years...There is unfortunately so much crap for sale these days that it is
really hard not to get burned.

Hiya Larry,

Before I took the Duck in for painting I took all the windows out.  After
all, the window seals were 32 years old and some were leaking.  And I
wanted
to get the paint under the seals where rust usually starts.

I wound up getting my seals (the chrome trim type) from Wolfsburg West.
These things are big honkers.  They look great.  Handling the windshield
seal
was like wrestling a boa constictor.  They haven't been installed yet, but
they sure do look good.

And, you are wise to ask about seals.  With seals I have seen the biggest
variation in quality of any of the VW-related parts.  I ordered window
seals
and trim for my Bug from West Coast Metric.  They have a great reputation
for
their rubber products.  What I got was practically worthless.  The
windshield
seal hardly fit over the seam.  As it is I can see all the clips on the
inside of the car and the seal is just barely over the seam.  Lousy stuff.
