Pretty much any vwflaps you go to to get plugs will offer you W8CC. Bosch's website will confirm the same thing if you search for transporter.

Having lived and driven my bus in Canada, Texas and now California I think the choice of plugs has less to do with climate and more with compression ratio. If you have a stocker, the advice to use W8CC seems ok to me.

&gt;    So, which plug will make me happier:  W7CC, W8CC or W8CC0?  And what's the
&gt;difference between W8CC and W8CC0??

I found this chart that shows you how to decode plugs for comparison:

I wish I could read German to translate the last column. I'm still looking for an english version. Does anyone know if the Bosch &quot;yellow&quot; spark plug book from Bentley explains it?
