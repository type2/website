&gt; &gt; I woulld suggest you give the bus to someone in Maine. Pay them to
&gt; &gt; maintain and insure it for you, and to rent it on your behalf to
&gt; &gt; others when you don't need it. Make the bus the property of a company
&gt; &gt; you own and they work for. Or something like that.
&gt;
&gt; This is a good idea, but it doesn't quite do the psychological work I
&gt; need it to do, which is to have &quot;one foot in&quot; Maine.
&gt;
&gt; Also, it's more complicated than I originally stated. In a couple
&gt; years' time I hope to have my baywindow in Maine and a Vanagon Westy in
&gt; Flagstaff, Arizona, until I can get myself wrenched free of entailments
&gt; in San Diego.

rent a garage in Maine to store your bus (and other home furnishings in)
and use that address as your Maine address, or get a post office box and
get a &quot;Box service&quot; to pick up and forward your mail.

where in Maine are you going, I lived in Auburn/Lewiston Maine back in the
80's
