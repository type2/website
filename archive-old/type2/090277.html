&gt; George Lyle will probably come up with an easier way, but that's it in a nutshell.

You've pretty much got it there.  for a bus using a stock lever ratio at
the pedal, you pretty much want to keep the bores equal.  If you want to
make the clutch easier to push (and that would be _super_ easy as the bus
already has a very light clutch) you could make the master bore a bit
smaller than the slave bore.  Remember that the area goes with the square
of the diameter, so don't make any drastic changes

A side issue that might save a lot of trouble:

A couple of years back I noticed that the cable routing went through a
narrow slot on the backside of one of the big threaded inserts for the
front axle beam attach on the frame.  Closer inspection revealed that the
cable was _cutting_ through that boss after being misrouted on the wrong
side of the insert.  The clutch action had caused the cable to cut halfway
through the approximately 1 inch diameter solid steel insert!  It must
have been that way for decades, but the cable showed no wear at all.  I
rerouted the cable and the clutch action became much easier (it wasn't
hard to begin with) and &quot;slicker&quot;.  Before playing with hydraulics, take a
look at the clutch cable routing to see if the same error might have been
made on yours.
