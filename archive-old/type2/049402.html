Christopher and Kellie sends:

&gt; Im assisting in getting my roommates westy ready for her big road trip and
&gt; one thing I thought Id like to tackle is help seal up the area just below
&gt; the front window, you know, where all the rust is?
&gt; 
&gt; Just below the window seal there are a bunch of really little holes, and im
&gt; assuming that everytime it rains this is where all the water is coming in
&gt; and puddling all over inside.

RTV silicone and thin sheets of aluminum will work if you really, really
don't care about looks. A prime source of this aluminum is 12-ounce
containers of Budweiser--cuts easily with scissors, bends to almost any
shape, and coming up with enough of the material to fix all the leaks is
more than half the fun!
