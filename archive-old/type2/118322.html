Subject: RE: [T2] extinguishers

I went to my local fire extinguisher shop.  You know those guys who do
all the extinguishers in the malls and businesses.  He sold me 3
extinguishers for 35 bucks.  Most shops like that have a pile of
extinguisher in the back that they're dying to get rid of in all kinds
of sizes.
