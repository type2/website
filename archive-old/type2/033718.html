[...]
&gt; 3) Buy a dual carb kit. I found a dual carb kit that I think will fit my
&gt; bus. Its from the latest JCW VW catalog. It runs $380 and contains what
&gt; looks like almost everything I need short of maybe some throttle cable
&gt; modifications. It has two manifolds, two 40mm solex/broso carbs, linkage,
&gt; air filters, fuel line, etc. It says it fits all type I air cooled engines
&gt; from 1500cc to 1835cc dual-port upright (is this what I have?) Would I
have
&gt; to do much (if any) modifications to install this or is it pretty much
bolt
&gt; in? Are there other better/lower priced kits out there? From what I
&gt; understand, this kit is supposed to be as close to stock as you can get
&gt; (other than actually stock).

This will NOT fit your 1800 engine. The dual port holes are spread farther
apart on a type 4 engine [yours] than they are on a type1 engine
[bugs/beetles].


 From what I understand, I have a type 2?

Yes, you have a bus, which is a type 2. 2 is the first # of your vehicle
identification number.

&gt; It also seems
&gt; that a Type X vehicle can have a different type X engine in it? For
example,
&gt; a Type II can have a Type I engine in it???

Yes, up to 71 has the upright fan beetle engine. Starting in 72, in the USA
spec vehicles, type 2's got the type 4 pancake/suitcase engines. these were
1700, 1800, or 2.0.

&gt; Also, how can I find out exactly
&gt; what engine I have (like CC and stuff)?

IF no one has changed the inside dimensions: bore and stroke. You can tell
the size from the first letter of the engine serial number. But this is a
big IF.

On a 72 + up pancake engine, do NOT go by the engine serial number on the
cooling fan housing. This housing can and will be swapped with other
engines. Use the engine number stamped into the block. It is behind the
square casting on the right side for the crankcase vent. There is a flat
boss between the fan housing and the square casting.
Look for 2 letters then numbers.
CB, CD = 1700
AW, ED = 1800
GD, GE = 2.0
Remember, these letters are worthless, i.e. if someone took a CB 1700 and
made it into a 1800 by changing the pistons and cylinders.
