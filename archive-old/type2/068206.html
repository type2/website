Subject: V8 engine stand answers + question

Hi all,
        Since two people asked me to tell them if I found anything,
and I always see V8 engine stands for sale but never VW engine stands,
I figured I let you all know what I heard.

JonR had the idea I think I'll go with.  That's to buy a bench top
engine stand (bout $20 from JCW, anyone have a catalog and want to
give me the part and catalog number as well as price for one of
those?) and have the correct size pipe welded onto the back so it fits
in the engine stand.  Others said that Snap On and JCW sell adapters,
but the JCW is ~45 and don't know about Snap-On.

Ok now for my question.  How do you get a T4 engine up high enough to
place it in the stand?  Did you hook up a pulley and such to lift it
up?  I don't want to admit to being a wimp, but I don't think I could
lift an engine up that high by myself, and I'm not sure how many
friends it would take:)

take care all,
          brandy
