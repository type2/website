It's Mick,
I feel humbled by the sheer amount of assistance offered on this one.
I've listened, looked, sifted the theories, got a fair idea. I located a
weighbridge, I'm all weighed up.
I'm a little surprised but van fully loaded - ready to go -
Front axle weight 800 kg. Rear axle weight 940 kg. Tare 1760 kg.
I have been waiting Michelins response (p.s.i ) on the Michelin
Classics, 185 R14 C, - 8 ply (1875 lbs.) to complete this query
and here it is :-
We note from the information supplied that the tyres now
     fitted to your camper are capable of carrying far higher loads than
    they are to be subjected to. This means the tyres are working at the
    lower end of their pressure range. We suggest that you set the
    pressures to the
     initial figures given below. This should avoid the tyres being too soft
     which can lead to poor handling. You can then, if necessary, gradually
     reduce/vary the pressures down to the minimum figures also given below,
   to optimise the handling while retaining the required load carrying
   capacity:-

     Initial - 40 psi Front and 44 psi Rear.

     Minimum - 34 psi Front and 38 psi Rear.

ps. Someone asked if these were available in the USA - Michelin said
'the information that is moulded into the tyre sidewall is part of the
information that we have to provide on the tyre to allow us
to sell it on the American/Canadian tyre market and does not
 necessarily have any relation to the tyres working condition within
the UK or Europe' !
Thanks to all.
Great list !

  &gt; &gt; Michelin need the individual  axle weights front and rear to give
accurate
  &gt; &gt; pressure recommendations.

  &gt; the bottom margin of this VIN sticker and you'll find
  &gt; something that looks like this:
  &gt;
  &gt; GVWR  LB.  4961
  &gt; GAWR  LB.  FRONT 2227 / REAR 2800

  Hi there,

  GVWR = Gross Vehicle Weight Rating
  GAWR = Gross Axle Weight Rating

  The GVWR is the maximum loaded capacity of the bus, based upon structural
and
  suspension design.  The GAWR is the maximum loaded capacity of each axle
based
  upon the stock equipment tires installed by VW at time of manufacture, the
axle
  bearings, and the suspension.  The correct tire has a size designation of
185 SR
  14 Reinforced on 72 and newer Campmobiles.  Or 185 R 14 C on mid 72 and
newer
  delivery vans and station wagons.  These two descriptors indicate a
heavier
  construction tire than the passenger car tires without the Reinforced or
C
  immediately after the number 14.  I have seen many Westys out there
running
  passenger rated tires.

  The reason for the above explanation is to lead into this:

  The GAWR for the front and rear axles add up to 5028 pounds, VW rates the
bus for
  a maximum GVWR of 4961.  My C rated tires are rated at 1710 pounds each at
55
  PSI.  I would reach the tire load limit at a weight of 6840 pounds, no
doubt
  causing stress on the axle bearings, suspension, and vehicle structure.
My guess
  is that I am not overloading my tires at 30 PSI and 40 PSI, front and
rear,  If I
  am on a long trip, and want to reduce the rolling resistance of the tires,
I can
  pump them up to 55 PSI, and gain a little in fuel economy.  The road noise
and
  rough ride is a little tough at 55 PSI.  Passenger car tires may be max
rated at
  32 or 35 PSI.  This is probably why VW calls for the heavier tires.

  My bottom line is do not over load the bus beyond the GVWR of 4961 pounds,
or
  whatever your federal certification label states.

  Any help?

  Mike D.
