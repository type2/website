Subject: Re: [T2] Broken into again. (fed up)

Guys,

I don't get it....was this stereo a *really* expensive setup?

Is this something that happens to bus folks often?  I can't imagine
a thief attacking a 30 year old *volkswagen* for a $100 stereo.

Am I just not the thief mentality or what?  The one I bought for my bus 
was a little over $100, not some $500 top of the line 5 zillion watt
output thumper.  

I think the lockable box between the seats is pretty good as you could 
have a lockable small foldback that flipped open to be able to get to the 
stereo installed there.

My personal preference would be for damage to the intruder(my redneck 
side)...like an ignition coil hooked to the car frame.&lt;grin&gt;...Yeah, I 
know if they get zapped and can't touch the car, then they are liable to 
just bash it.

Young_hippy....if you live in a place where this sort of thing happens, 
then maybe it is time to consider moving...to someplace where you *know* 
your neighbors...

Cheers, dave
