Subject: External Oil Cooler for Pancake

Who has installed an external oil cooler in their pancake engine? My 
housemate and fellow Bus owner Stefan Ufer has installed one that taps 
off from the oil filter, but he had to remove the left-side heater tube 
to make room for the oil hoses...

Does any one have any experience they'd like to share as far as sources 
and installation details?
