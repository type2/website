Subject: 2 different heater boxes

My driver's side and passenger's side heater boxes look different. Most 
noticably, the drivers side has an oval hole on top thar a pipe connects to. 
this pipe runs up into the engine compartment. the other end is round and it 
connects to the little squirrell fan. The passenger side is reverse. It is 
round at the box at oval at the other end. Also, the one is secured in a 
coupe more places than the other is.
Thanks,
Kyle
