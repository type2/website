My experiments with vacuum bleeders is, you must typically remove the
bleeder and pack the threads with grease or sealant or you can draw air
bubbles through the threads. Note when you pressure bleed a system you
almost always get some weepage out the threads. The treads don't seal.
That's why the bleeder has the tapered seat, for positive sealing with low
torque. Consider over tightening of bleed screws is prevelent in
doityourselfistry. All those that break were over torqued or haven't been
used for purpose since Thoth Hermes, ie, unmaintained. A firm thumb on a
100mm long wrench is all that is required for a serviceable seal.
