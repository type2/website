&gt; &gt; Mark,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You are on the right track in looking at the mix over the operating 
&gt;range.
&gt; &gt; Why the preset air/fuel map in your air mass sensor isn't correct isn't
&gt; &gt; clear. Maybe the PO fooled with it.
&gt;
&gt;Unless I missed something, this would be an AFM, not an air mass sensor.

Sorry air flow meter or air mass sensor.

&gt;But, in any case, the &quot;map&quot; which plots required fuel for various inputs, 
&gt;is
&gt;contained in the ECU.

I was under the impression the &quot;map&quot; is defined by the tap locations along 
the pot in the &quot;AFM&quot;

The AFM and AMS both perform the same function of
&gt;signalling to the ECU the engine's &quot;demand&quot; for fuel based on the air
&gt;flowing into the engine.  The problem with AFM's is that the spring that
&gt;resists the movement of the vane weaken over time, signalling to the ECU
&gt;that the engine needs a richer mixture than it really needs.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The &quot;ideal 14.7:1 ratio or 0.450 volts&quot; is NOT ideal for air cooled VWs. 
&gt;I
&gt; &gt; try for no greater than 13:1 idle or cruise. Sorry but your guess as to
&gt;what
&gt; &gt; 13:1 equals on your set up is as good as mine. I would set it at 0.625
&gt;volts
&gt; &gt; and look at the plugs and exhaust color. Better rich than lean.
&gt;
&gt;While it's true that, for engine longevity, running richer is better than
&gt;running leaner, I'm not sure your practice here has any real affect.  When
&gt;the engine's warmed up the ECU looks to run the mixture right around the
&gt;ideal ratio, which is right around .5 volts for a properly functioning O2
&gt;sensor.  So, if you unhook your O2 sensor, fool around with the idle air
&gt;mixture to run &quot;rich&quot; and then reconnect your O2 sensor, I'm not sure you
&gt;accomplish much.

Sorry I thought that this was non closed loop such as a 1977 and Mark was 
using  an Ox detector to set up the open loop air fuel ratio.
