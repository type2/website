Subject: Question on how oil bath filters work

Hello everyone,

I just cleaned my oil bath filter.  Wasn't too bad.  

After I added 30 weight oil and reassembled it, I sucked air through the
outlet that leads to the carb. I expected to hear the air being sucked
through the oil. Like a bubbling sound or something. 

Instead, there wasn't really any noise, or resistance to indicate the
air was being drawn through the oil. Can anyone clue me in to the
function of the oil bath filter? Should I be hearing anything?


Thanks for any help,
Jon Wade

P.S.  Thanks to all who responded to my question the other day about the
oil pressure sensor hole leaking.  It turned out the sensor (that was
just installed) was leaking!
