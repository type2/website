Subject: Camping at O'Leno State Park, High Springs, FL  **this weekend**

Folks,

I'll be in site 18, Magnolia Camping Area at O'Leno State Park from late Friday afternoon/eve through Sunday.  A few Tallahasseans are coming 
along for the weekend.  Anyone else joining us?  Look for the red '71 westy with window screen instead of canvas in the poptop.

I plan to put my boat on the Santa Fe at US 27 on Saturday morning as early as I can get over there - 9 or 10ish - and head downriver past all the 
springs to a takeout point on State Road 47.  If you want to join me, let me know -- I have a line on discount canoe rentals (thanks, Sandy!) but will 
need to know ASAP how many you want.  Word is the river is way low, which may mean some spots are tough to get through, but it should be 
especially clear, too.  Figure on it taking most of the day, so bring lunch.

Sunday might be a good day to tube the Ichetucknee.

There are several places to eat in High Springs.  One of my faves is the Great Outdoors Cafe: http://www.greatoutdoorscafe_dot_com/h_menu.htm.  
More eats at http://www.highsprings_dot_com/fooddining.php.  A grocery store is less than 15 minutes from the park.

Let me know if you want a canoe for Sat!
