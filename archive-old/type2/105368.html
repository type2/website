&gt; Well--I give.
&gt; The super glue wins.
&gt;  This morning I did go to a hobby shop and purchase some release
&gt; agent--the best-- and nothing happened.

&quot;release agent&quot;?

Terry, if you were able to make sure that the Un-Cure (must be the BSI
stuff) didn't hurt the fabric, then put some on the dried glue and leave it
for a while.  If the glue is CA-based the Un-Cure will eventually soften the
glue, even if it takes a long time.  Un-Cure evaporates much more slowly
than straight acetone does.

If the glue is only partially softened, carefully wipe off what you can, and
apply more of the Un-Cure, repeating as necessary until you're satisfied
with the results.
