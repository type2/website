Subject: The POR-15 Battery Tray Sandwich

	Had a couple half dollar size holes in my battery tray on my '71
transporter and since I do not have a welder I performed the following
technique:

	1.  Wire wheeled the rusty areas down.  Cleaned the area thoroughly and
applied POR -15 Metal ready.

	2.  Cut out 2 approximately 8 X 14 inch pieces of sheet metal and also
sprayed these with metal ready;

	3.  Painted both sides of the battery tray area with POR-15 (I used the
Gray color POR 15) and also both sides of the 2 pieces of sheet metal;

	4.  After POR-15 cured, I pop riveted one sheet on the top of the battery
tray area using 1/8 inch pop rivets spaced about an inch apart around the
perimeter;

	5.  Then I did the same with the other piece but from the bottom of the bus;

	6.  Next I used the POR-15 Epoxy Putty around the perimeter seam on both
sides;

	7.  After the putty cured, I painted over it with POR-15 on top of the
tray area and used roofing tar on the bottom of the bus ( undercoating
would work too.)

	I know this is not an original restoration but it seems very solid and
looks decent.  I'll let you know how it holds up.
