Hate to disagree but the oil cooler will indeed get cooling air without the 
flap.  I've run both ways with full instrumentation and I can tell you it 
didn't make a big difference *in my case*.  That said, the flap does appear 
to have a significant function with respect to airflow through the oil 
cooler.  I would need to be better versed in fluid dynamics to be able to 
explain exactly what that function is, but I decided to err on the side of 
caution and leave the flaps in.  Nobody's bus has died (that I know of) 
because the flaps were left in.

&gt;  They are an integral part of the cooling systems and should not be left
&gt;out.

I agree with you there.
