Subject: Re: [T2] Webber Progressive pics

I'm with Pops on this one.  The rubber boots where the carb base plate
connects to the manifolds are notorious for leaking.  Check the clamps as
I've seen problems with the clamps failing and they look good but don't
apply much pressure to seal the rubber.  Get it to idle as low as you can
and spray some carb cleaner on 'em.  If the RPMs increase, voila.  Get new
clamps (better yet, get new boots--their cheap).  This system is pretty
simple.  Should be easy to find the leak.

Good luck,
Bill

Subject: [T2] Webber Progressive pics


&gt; My father and I are trying to get my bus, a '74 1.8l with a Webber
&gt; Progressive carb, tunedproperly. I've been having problems with the choke
'sticking' in cold
&gt; weather. Everytimewe adjust the idle down the engine dies. My father seems
to think there
&gt; may be a vacuum leak.While he has significant amounts of knowledge about
automotive mechanics,
&gt; he hasn't dealtwith this carb in a bus (or really any bus) before. I've
only had the bus
&gt; for a couple months andthe engine was rebuilt just before I got it (I
helped put it back in). But
&gt; somewhere down theroad, the correct configuration of the carb seems to
have been lost (along
&gt; with the title tothe bus).
&gt;
&gt; The title is being fixed and now I'm working on the carb. Does anyone have
&gt; anypictures of a 1.8l with a webber prog PROPERLY setup? It would be VERY
&gt; helpful. Diagramswould be cool too. The Bentley and Muir books are useless
here. I almost
&gt; bought a book onwebber carbs at the FLAPS but decided to hold off as it
seemed geared towards
&gt; performance.
