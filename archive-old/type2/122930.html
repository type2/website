Subject: RE:door locks

I've read with interest the thread on the door locks.  I'd suggest pulling 
the handle and latch mechanism, then cleaning/lubing the latch,  Try your 
key in the handle and make sure it turns freely.  If not, then clean/lube 
it.  I suggest carb cleaner to cut the old grease.  SuperLube or Tri-Flow is 
the recommended lubricant.  Some have suggested graphite, but I'd advise 
against that.  It combines with any left over grease and forms a paste that 
will gum up the lock.  I can't tell you how many locks I overhaul that are 
gummed up with graphite.  Stick with the synthetic lubes and the locks will 
appreciate it.
