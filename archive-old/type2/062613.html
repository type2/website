The 25, 36, &amp; 40 hp engines used copper gaskets between the heads and jugs.

The 1300, 1500, &amp; 1600 engines did not use any gasket at all!

The 1700, 1800, &amp; 2000 engines use gaskets between the heads and jugs.

They all require gaskets at the jug/case seam.

Spacer shims are added to the bottom of the jugs to drop CR on all engines.
