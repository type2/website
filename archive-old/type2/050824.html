Subject: [T2] Red Heat Lever

I was saddened to learn that the old stock on the red heat levers for 74-79
( #211 259 371A) Bus have finally dried up. RMMW and Bus Depot are out. I
found a couple at Bus Boys last week. After I got mine they only had 4 left
in their inventory. My original ones cracked the first time I had to remove
them. When I got the new ones I greased them up in the hopes of an easier
removal. The blue ones are still available, but those red and blue levers
are a big part of the nostalgic look to the dash.
I know my heater has a lot to be desired, but pulling down on those red
levers psychologically seem warmer than pulling on all blue ones
