&gt;First, the battery is constantly going dead on me.
&gt;One day it'll start up fine, the next the battery is
&gt;dead and has to be jumped.  My guess is the alternator
&gt;or the starter, but I can't tell cause it's so
&gt;inconsitent.

I usually use a meter on the battery. With the engine off I get 
12.something volts on the battery, with the engine running and the 
alternator working I have 14.something volts.

Muir's book has a procedure for checking to see which electrical system has 
a short.
