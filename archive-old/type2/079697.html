Right.  My point exactly.  But they are concerned
with head temps.  (Of course, they only need to
run for one race, right?)

&gt; Not only does it help reduce emissions but it
&gt; keeps the heads cooler.
&gt; Sounds win-win to me.  The goal is not to cool
&gt; the exhaust gases down as
&gt; that wouldn't really help anything that I know
&gt; of, but to use the exhaust
&gt; gases to keep the combustion chamber temps
&gt; down.

If this is the concensus by the learned guru's,
and so far no one has commented to the contrary,
then I'd better go check to ensure my EGR is
working.  :)  

Cool heads = good thing.
