Subject: Re: [T2] Re Wire frying when opened engine lid

[...]
check  the voltage  at the battery with the engine running after reving 
up to about 3k momentarily.  You should see  about 13.5 volts from the 
gen/alt

&gt; Success ! I did have the wiring correct, but found
&gt; a loose wire at the starter that came 1/2 unplugged while I was
&gt; replacing the main battery wire. Now the bus starts and runs correctly,
&gt; but the battery light is on dimly, even when I rev up the engine 
&gt; significantly.
&gt; I take this to mean it is not charging correctly ?
&gt;
&gt; The battery measured 12.7 volts with my voltmeter. Not sure if something
&gt; else was fried when the sort happened. Maybe my voltage regulator ?
&gt;
&gt; Appreciate any ideas.
&gt; Thanks
