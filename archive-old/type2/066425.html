Subject: RE: Engine Stand Question

Nathan D. asks about the JCWitless engine &quot;stand&quot; that bolts to a workbench.
I think it's fine for the price.  I use mine for Porsche engines, altho
that requires supporting the other end as well, either with a jack from
below or a comealong from above.  You'd need a pretty serious workbench;
I bolted it onto a frame of 4x4s, at a height my floorjack can just reach.
So I work sitting down, and don't need any helpers to get the engine on
or off the stand.
