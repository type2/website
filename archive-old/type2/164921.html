Subject: Death Valley

I lived in Beatty, NV from '61 to '69, about 20 miles north of Death Valley. The 
El Portal Motel has been a long time lodge, there may be some more modern 
places. Ask around for the Mercedes Benz crew, they've tested cars in the valley 
during the day and tore 'em down at night in the MB equipped high school auto 
shop. Not sure if they do any more or if the Johnson's still own the El Portal. 
Tell 'em I sent you in any case. 

I learned much later that a single cab was around town in the day. It might be 
around still, nothing rusts much on the desert.
