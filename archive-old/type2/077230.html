&gt; &gt;&gt; problem: my electronic control unit. I'm not sure if I can keep my ECU from
&gt; &gt;&gt; my automatic bus to run a manual tranny.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;the ECU is different but close enough that the average person wouldn't
&gt; &gt;know the difference.
&gt;
&gt; Abnormal inquiring minds would like to know what the differences are.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; The big question is : Could I use my ECU from my automatic bus to run a
&gt; &gt;&gt; manual transmission?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;yes, BUT!
&gt;
&gt; That's a big BUT, Bob !  There are 4 brains listed for the 79, ( 2 are
California ),
&gt; and there are indeed separate boxes for Manual and Automatic. It may be
fuel-map
&gt; related if the engine torque curves are different. Otherwise, they use
essentially the
&gt; same fuel injection components, with a slight difference in idle speed.
Probably works.

An even bigger BUT...... you cannot use Calif ECU's in a Fed bus. You cannot use
Fed ECU's in a Calif bus. In 1979 year buses.
Yes you can swap a Cal auto trans for a manual trans ECU and not see any
difference. You can swap Fed auto and manual ECU's and not see any difference.

California buses do NOT have the resister pack on the gas tank panel. The
injector resistance is built into the EFI harness and ECU. Calif buses have an
O2 sensor. Calif buses use a different double relay.
79 Fed buses are the same configuration as 78 buses.
