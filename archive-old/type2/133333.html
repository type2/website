&gt; Anyone know of a source for the molding that goes between the cabinet's and

&gt; The piping type that goes between the closet and cargo door frame and at the
&gt; rear between the rear hatch and cabinet.
&gt;
&gt; I've checked the archives and unless I'm using the wrong search words can't
&gt; find the info.  Did see were Boyd Smith ask a similar question some time back.
&gt; I've checked Gowesty_dot_com,and outwater_dot_com and all I find is the T-Molding.

try Outwater   www.outwater_dot_com
