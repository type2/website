Subject: Sharing a voltmeter between two batteries

I have somewhat limited real estate for installing gauges in 
the dash. I was wondering about the feasability of using one 
voltmeter (with a switch) to read the voltage in two 
batteries. One is an Optima Deep Cyle, and one is my standard 
starter battery. Any reason this wouldn't work, or would 
something about the wiring required remove the isolation 
between the two bateries? I am using the &quot;silver fridge 
relay&quot; setup from www.vanagon_dot_com

Thanks,
Chris
