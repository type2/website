Subject: Re: [T2] how do I install a baby seat in a bus

Thanks for your replies.  I no longer have the original seat belts.  Where can
I find the ratchet type webbing you mentioned?  There is usually a strap that
anchors at the head of the seat.  Where would I anchor this on the bus?
Anybody have a pic they could e-mail me?

Thanks very much.

  I wouldn't mount it to the jump seat. Puts the child too close to the window
for my comfort.

  In my 73 I mounted to the back seat/bed next to the cabinet. This provides
some protection and distance from the outside of the bus in case I'm T-boned.
In my 78 with 7-pass seating, she's in the middle seat on the passenger
(right) side. Again some distance from any oncoming vehicles.

  Because of the room you have, you can use the biggest most heavy duty seat
you can find. The one I'm using doesn't fit in my Volvo at all. But in the bus
it's not a problem. The larger seats also tend to be more comfortable and the
kid won't grow out of it as quickly. (She's nearly 3 and already the seat in
the Volvo is getting too small.)
