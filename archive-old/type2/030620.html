Ray,

Probably the reason we have not had much traffic on the subject of the
proportioning valve is that those puppies are pretty bulletproof.  I've
never seen a bad one and would have no idea how to go inside one.

Another factor may be that they are all broken and we just ain't noticed
:-)  (we've had volk, on the list here, who have lost their power brake
assist and not noticed it)

But I don't think that's your problem.  David pointed in the right
direction with adjusting the parking brake, but before you do that, do
this:  adjust the rear shoes 'til the wheels won't turn.  Tight. On all
four shoes...  Get in the car and see if the problem has gone away.  If it
hasn't, bleed the brakes again (all 4 wheels) with the shoes tight against
the drums and see if that does not help. The problem is that 1/4th of the
amount of fluid the MC is pumping (the amount an individual cylinder sees)
isn't very much.  If there is any play at all in the adjustment, then it
is near impossible to really bleed the brakes as the fluid gets eaten up
moving the shoes out to the drums, with only a smidge left over to push
out the bleeder valve.

After the brakes are bled, then back the shoes off 1 or two notches at a
time, 'till the wheel spins with only a whisper of contact.  You don't
want to come all the way off the wheel with the shoes, as that is too
loose but between one notch and the next there is a place where there is a
whisper of contact during part of the rotation. 

Once the brakes are adjusted high and hard, then follow David's advice on
adjusting the parking brake.  The number of notches you need to pull the
parking brake for engagment is an excellent indicator of brake shoe wear.
If you need more than 10-15 notches of pull to get engagement, then it's a
sure bet that it's time to adjust your brakes!

Another problem I have seen in adjusting brake shoes is that they are
rarely adjusted evenly.  The stars need to be turned the same number of
turns on both the front and back shoe, otherwise the piston gets seriously
off center. If you have never done this, then back both adjustors off all
the way and adjust them out the same # of notches on each 'til you get a
rub.  get in the car and stomp the brakes a time or two.  the rub will be
gone!  then adjust them again 'til you get a rub.  (rinse, lather, repeat
:-)  You can do this 5-25 times depending on how far off center the
pistons are, but it should be done!  At rest, the pistons of the brake
cylinder should be about equally distant from the center, it promotes long
brake cylinder life :-)
