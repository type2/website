Subject: Re: [T2] Catalytic Converters

From Richard Atwell:

I was working on another bus last weekend trying to tune it up pass it's smog test. It had failed the first
test and I felt the only way to help ensure it didn't fail a second time was to use my wide-band oxygen sensor
and drive the bus at the same 15 and 25mph speeds the dyno test performs.

 My sensor is installed in the u-bend of my 78 exhaust:

 I had resigned myself to swapping this part over to the 76 bus but we hit a major roadblock: although the
heat exhangers had been removed in the past, three of the 6 fasteners were factory originals. In other words,
everything rusted so badly we were never going to be able to get it off without removing most of the exhaust
system to work it into submission in the garage.

I am puzzled as to why you picked one of the 2 U pipes. O in this pic:

That will only tell you about 1 side.

Why didn't you choose the U at the end of the cross-over pipe?  There is a test port there already. F in the
same pic above.
