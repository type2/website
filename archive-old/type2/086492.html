just got back from Manassas bug out and had fun, but gotta admit the =
Florida Bug Jam has a lot more cars and a lot less of the water-cooled =
crap...............No early busses or bugs at the show........kinda =
disappointed, but had fun nonetheless and saw a few of the list faithful =
such as Mark Dearing of Salem Imports..................those of you that =
do not realize it, Mark has tons of old parts.
