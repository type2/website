Subject: [T2] Bus parts buying adventure.....

Hey all,
   I am wondering if anyone has had any experience buying parts from  
&quot;European Motor Works&quot;. Some history-
    I placed an ad on thesamba stating that I WTB a child's cot for my 79 
Westy.  I got a call from a gentleman the next day saying that he had one for 
sale. He sent me pics too.  I sent him a postal money order the next day, via 
priority mail, with delivery confirmation. 
     According to the USPS, he rec'd the money order over a week ago. Yet he 
tells me that he still hasn't gotten it.  I plan on going to the Post Office 
today to see if the money order has been cashed, and what, if anything can be 
done to track it down.
    Just wondering if anyone has ever dealt with this guy before on VW parts? 
Hopefully I am not out 83 dollars........

   Thanx
