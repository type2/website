&gt; FWIW, my wife's mini van had a problem somewhat similar. when you stepped on

&gt; there was a bad connection and the lead leads melted until they touched.

yeah I have had a few screwy problems that drive you nuts,  one time the
bulb holder in the taillight came loose and fell back against the battery,
and the light wouldn't go out.

a loose connection on the coil one time caused intermittent missing.

so my suggestion at this point would be to carefully check each connection
and wire to make sure they are tight and are connected
