Subject: RE:Continental tires &amp; T II Vs TIV

When searching for tires for my bus I called Continental, and ended up
talking to
an &quot;Application Engineer&quot; He told me that they had a tire that was
specifically designed for and listed
only for the Volkswagen Van. I bought Michelins because a local shop I trust
had them, and was
going to need to special order the Conti's

Regarding the Type 2, Type 4 question. It gets more complicated if your van
has
the cold fusion option from the Type 7 engine. This consists of Palladium
plated pistons, and a heavy water
injection system. This adds about 25 horsepower. Looking at the heavy water
consumption
on my van to date, I figure I'll get about 125,000 miles out of the quart my
brother in-law got me
(he works at a nuclear power plant) which would equate to 500,000 miles per
gallon.
Note: This option would not be practical in California because your Helium
emissions
would be too high to pass the smog test. Also the neutron emissions seem to
be discoloring the 
paint on my engine lid, and the bottom of the back hatch.

YMMV
