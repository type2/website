Joe,
This tent I was describing was delivered new with a 1976 Westfalia
Deluxe, as an option, from VW, as described and pictured in the 1976
Campmobile suppliment.
It is a genuine Westfalia, yellow/ orange, with blue top and bottom,
with red and white striped front flap.
I have zero idea who else might have made a tent in 1976, that was also
sold by VW, but for sure they most certainly are not pictured or listed
in any VW manuals.

This is the real McCoy.
