Subject: Re: [T2] Here's a thought about grounding...

From: &quot;ncbus&quot; &lt;macbus_at_mindspring_dot_com&gt;
&gt; Discharging static is a good thing. It reduces the risk of a gasoline
vapor explosion when one fills up the gerry can for the zero radius mower
whist it sits in the bed of the f250d if one is so equipped.

Saw several similar mishaps on the TV.  I now make sure that my hand is
grounded to the pump when dispensing petrol, and that the vehicle has been
discharged into a ground after parking at the pump.  Heck, I don't even use
my cell phone at the pump anymore.

The most surprising one (to me) was the one where the father slid back into
the vehicle to get his cash, and the static that the slide generated was
enough to spark the fire when he went back to the nozzle in the car's
filler.  He was able to narrowly rescue his daughter from the vehicle before
the flames got to her.

The saddest one was the video of the woman filling the vehicle when it
caught fire and she tried to pull the nozzle out of the filler.  It was too
hot to grab by the handle, so she pulled it out by the hose and it sprayed
all over her and the vehicle.  She didn't make it.

Wow, that was depressing...

Be careful, Dudes &amp; Dudettes.
