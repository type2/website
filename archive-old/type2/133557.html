&gt; 	Ok, this is a follow up on my breakdown two weeks ago going to Fire on the
&gt; Mountain in GA.
&gt; Since then I have spent the last two weeks swapping out parts with spares
&gt; and buying a few new ones.
&gt;  	Compression is 110 or better on all 4 cyl. No air leaks in FI
&gt; found, Coil,
&gt; Dist, points, cond, wires, plugs, Aux air reg, ECU, AFC, Throttle, Fuel
&gt; pump, Fuel Pressure Reg, Brain, Muffler all have been swapped out with
&gt; spares.  Dwell and Timing check out.  Vacuum check also checks out.

have you checked your distributor for proper advancing.  the vacuum can
may be leaking.  that will keep your acceleration down.

&gt; 	I think I have tried everything in the motor and I still have a slow
&gt; acceleration problem.  I can't get it over 40-45 mph.  Driving today to fill
&gt; the tank with High Test gas, I noticed that at 40-45 when I hit the gas to
&gt; find if I could get to cruising speed, the Bus eng revved up but slowed down
&gt; like it is being held back.  I did a &quot;Stall Speed Test&quot; according to the
&gt; Bentley manual to test the converter, this passed the test, and so it is not
&gt; the converter.  Result was 2000 rpm on the Tach, with a driver in the seat

what year bus?? the 003 auto tranny needed a vacuum line to shift
correctly.

&gt; the bus gas pedal, floored with the Emergency brake Set and the Brakes being
&gt; held keeping the bus still.  Scary, but only lasts a couple of seconds.
&gt; Bentley states if 1500-1600 RPM is all that is achieved then the converter
&gt; is bad, but if 1900-2000 is achieved then it is Ok.  Above the mark of 2000
&gt; RPM it could be a problem with the 1st gear one-way.  But I was right on the
&gt; mark of 2000rpm.
&gt; 	Bentley Service manual Section 7 page 7 #16 has a section about Poor
&gt; acceleration. Top speed low despite good eng output.
&gt; 	Anyone have an opinion here, it is welcome.  The tranny fluid is good, only
&gt; 1 year old, correct level, I also checked the final drive hypoid oil, and it
&gt; is Ok.

have you cleaned the tranny filter??? could be fluid starvation.

&gt; 	But I seem to not be able to get into High Gear with my Bus, Is it motor or
&gt; Tranny issue?

could be either but more likely motor from the sounds of it.
