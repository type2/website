Subject: Re: [T2] How much how fast? (oil)

1974 with 17K on a 1.8 ltr AVP longblock. Using 40 weight Shell Performance
with no additives. Changing oil and filter at 2k. No leaks, no oil loss at
all. I have, so far, not had to add even a tiny bit of oil between changes,
even after doing 1200 miles in 3 days. Also, I have absolutely NO smell of
gas in the oil. Did a change about a week ago and the oil just smelled like
oil, not a hint of gas smell.

regards,
Dave

How often do you find yourself adding oil?  And how much oil do you find
yourself adding?
Do most of you use 15-40 or 20-50?  Any preferences in brand?  I know some
swear by Lucas.  How much of it do you usually put in when doing an oil
change?

I have been using 15-40 chevron and use Lucas with my oil changes.  I have a
20-30 min. highway commute to work 5 days a week and usually find myself
adding a little oil every other days.

Just curious
Thanks,
Kyle
