Subject: Help, orphaned bus needs home

Help, I need to dispose of a 1971 Westfalia van.  It is in St Augustine, FL 
and needs a new home fast.  It is currently parked in my backyard without an 
engine.  As far as I know the lack of an engine is the only thing wrong with 
it, apart from the expected rust from sitting too long.  The rust is fixable 
though.  Please don't let this bus go to the junkyard!  I can no longer keep 
it and already feel guilty enough at neglecting it for so long.  Email me at 
DJWestie_at_aol_dot_com if you are interested in taking it away.  We are asking $500 
for it but all offers will be considered at this point.  

Thanks
