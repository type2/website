&gt; (&quot;Timeserts&quot; are good).  When you finally get them in...USE THE COPPER SELF 
&gt; TIGHTENING EXHAUST STUD NUTS... that are available at you local VW Flaps. 

Firstly, most of these are only copper coated, and not real copper.  You
may need to look harder.

Second, every single one of these I've gotten (including in the german
Listritz (sp?) install kits) are OVAL on one side.  Once you get them on
that stud, they STAY on that stud.  which is good for vibration...bad for
removal.

&gt; They are a softer metal and will NEVER freeze on the steel studs.

they may not be frozen from corrosion, but stuck nontheless.
