Subject: RE: [T2] Rubber 

Something like this:
WET SILICONE #T75112
A unique combination of silicone and oil which lubricates, protects and
leaves surfaces coated with a never dry residual film. Forms a thin flexible
film that seals out moisture and corrosion. Restores body, moisture and life
to dried out rubber surfaces. Lengthens the life of weather stripping and
seals. 

This is the type product I used but not the exact same brand. I am sure one
of the big box home improvement stores will have it also but, if not go
here:

look in the online catalog under chemicals (pg.59) for rubber cleaner. That
is the first place to start...gotta have clean rubber...then here is where
the rest of gets fuzzy...see I was only 19 when i used this stuff and now I
am 36...my memory ain't what it use to be...I will find though...give me a
bit. I suppose a food grade silicone spray would work the same as the gel I
used many years ago.
