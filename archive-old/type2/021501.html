I was trying to put the 'hot start problem' ignition rely that we all
have had probs with, but I got underneth of my new beloved '70 &quot;Barbara
Ann&quot;, I knoticed that the ''numknuts&quot; that owned it before ran a new
ignition wire &quot;UNDERNETH THE CAR,  ON THE UNDER SIDE OF THE BELLPAN&quot;
Havent been campin in her yet but it would have really pissed me off to
go over somthing sharp and have the car just stop. T replace, do the
wires snake along the the left side of her like my bug? and whats the
best way to snake a new wire?, John Muir had no input, (god I miss him,
Hope ye doin donut's inda sky dude)
