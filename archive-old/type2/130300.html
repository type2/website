Subject: ka-BOOOM!! (was Re: [T2] Help- I played mechanic)

&gt;All kidding aside, get yourself a small hose that you can
&gt;get into the spark plug hole and connect it to a big vacuum 
&gt;cleaner hose and see what you can vacuum out of the cylinder,

Please, please, PLEASE be careful when using a vacuum cleaner around
anything that could contain gasoline (either liquid or gas form)!

I tried to find some pics that used to be on the web concerning this, but
only found the following write-up:
http://www.corvair_dot_org/chapters/chapter017/articles/vacuumjet.html  Too bad
'cause the pics were spectacular!

Read it and think carefully before using a vacuum cleaner to suck from a
cylinder.  Seems to me that if the intake valve was open you could be in for
a nasty surprise....
