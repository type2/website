&gt; I was told that it took three men 3 hours to put the
&gt; right rear side window w/o the vent wing back in the
&gt; bus. 

They were obviously working with a seal just like mine. :-)

I took my bus to a local glass shop -- they had a bunch of vintage autos
hanging around (points). I didn't ask for a quote, but I don't think
it'll be very much. They could've given me a three guys/three days/$30
an hour line, but they looked at it, tried to fit the sealed glass in
the opening, told me it was the seal and I needed to get another one and
to come back when I did (major points)

The story so far is that West Coast Metric -- the closest VW place to me
-- has a late shipment coming from Germany &quot;any day now.&quot; So the job
ain't finished yet. I'll let y'all know how it goes and if it was indeed
the seal.
