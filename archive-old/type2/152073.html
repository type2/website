Subject: Re: [T2] Stage 2 - how big is a westy ?

&gt; Quick question if anyone has a tape measure handy could they give me
&gt; overall dimensions of a '71 westy (I guess '68-73) will do and be sure
&gt; to include the door mirrors in the width . although I guess we'll fold
&gt; them in for shipping.

take the mirrors and anything else removable off,
the price is based on longest, widest, highest,   (cubic size)

if it is on the outside it is likely to get broke

I shipped VW from Germany to USA via private shipping company and this was
advice from shiping co.
