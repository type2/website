Here in Southern California people are pretty stuck up. Big Sport Utility Vehicles are the IN thing. The only VW bus that is admired is the pre-1967. If it is a 21 window bus, it is worshipped. Anything newer than a 1967, its like &quot;Why would you drive that ugly thing??&quot; Only us, the true VW bus fanatics know why. People here on the freeways don't hesitate to flip you the finger if you get on the freeway slow, or if you go the posted speed limit. It is a small price to pay, but VW bus ownership is worth the little &quot;annoyances&quot;.
