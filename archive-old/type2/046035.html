Subject: [T2] Re:Trip report -/AIRS

When i removed your last name i noticed your phone number wasnt on there in
the first place. Some ppl like it like that - their info is only used for
ppl who plan trips and email them ahead of time with non emergency wants
(place to sleep etc) so i didnt think much of it when I saw it wasnt
there.Mustve been a mix up from way back or I never got it in the first
place. I just got your email with your #. I'll put it on

AIRS www.type2_dot_com/rescue


&gt;&gt;Andy's on
 the AIRS list but he's changed his listing so no phone # and me without
 internet access.  Look him up in the phone book.
&gt;No phone # huh. Surprise to me. Im mailing wade to get him to put it back
&gt;on. When I asked him to make my listing first name only I guess he pulled
&gt;my phone # too?????
