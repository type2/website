&gt; By &quot;the seals don't show&quot;, did you mean:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. _completely_ do not show,
&gt; 
&gt; 2. that _no_ part of the seal shows around the edge of the lens,
&gt; 
&gt; and 3. that you _cannot_ see any part of the seal through the lens itself?
&gt; 

Magical Mike,
Some seals are designed to create an edge around the part for cosmetic 
purposes such as the front turn signal lenses on a 68-70somthing bus.
This seal is completely enclosed under the lens and cannot be seen behind, 
around the edge or thru the reflector.

P.s. what was poisoning you with Chlorine gas as you stated in earlier posts?
I'm worried about you.
