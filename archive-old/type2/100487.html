Subject: Re: [T2] Alternator light on

Hi Folks,

I figured I'd weigh in on this one as well.  My alternator light sometimes 
stays on when I first start my 1979 Westy.  My alternator light came on 
while driving, and I replaced the voltage regulator with a cheapo NAPA one 
(I was 200 miles from home).  When that didn't solve the problem, I replaced 
the alternator.  After that, the light would stay on every time I started 
it.  So, I went back to the stock (original?) voltage regulator, and now the 
light stays on only once in a while.

The typical symptoms seem to be cold weather and slow idle.  With the light 
on, my voltmeter sits around 11.5-12 volts.  In all cases, the light goes 
out and the voltmeter jumps up to 14 volts when the engine speed increases 
to about 1,000rpm.  It seems like some relay closes, or the charging system 
comes fully online.

Anyway, I don't know what the cause is, but it goes away as soon as I start 
driving.
