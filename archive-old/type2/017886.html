Subject: sagging rear end on bay window
Message-ID: &lt;37307898sagging rear end on bay window*_at_m400gw.wiley_dot_com&gt;

Hey I've noticed over the years that alot of bay window buses have a sag in 
the rear end. Whats the deal with that? My 77 had it and I figured it was the 
heavier 2 liter motor, but I'm noticing my 71 with it now and wonder about 
it. Anyone know what goes on here?
