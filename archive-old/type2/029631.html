Jason, and all,

First, as someone else said, new copper rings are a must!  You will never
get a good seal on rings that have been used.  Two more tips are:

First, the holes the studs fit thru are on *WAY* too tight a spec.  If you
take them to a machine shop and have them drilled to the next larger size
(just a couple thousandths of an inch), you will have a *much* easier time
of installing them. I drilled my first set out at home, and they are
*tough*, which is why I suggest a machine shop (unless you own a drill
press)  Only go one size larger on the holes, you do want a tight fit, but
not near as tight as VW made them!!!

Second, to hold the copper rings in place while you are getting the boxes
on...  I *think* it was Sami Dahklia who suggested this originally (and
Thanks!!!  it has been a blessing!!!)...  Put some grease on them and that
will hold them into the head while you slide the box onto the studs.

Third (I lied :-), If any of your exhasut studs is mangled, you need to
take it to the same machine shop as the heater boxes.  If you try to
replace it at home, you will probably bugger it and the machinist will
*not* thank you for that.  Unhappy machinists have ways of getting revenge
:-) This does not apply if you have experience/are a machinist, of course,
but for us mere mortals, I suggest you learn to pull head studs on a dead
head before you try it on the good ones on your bus, honest!!!

Gaskets should be faily easy, Bus Depot, Bus Boys, RMMW....  most
competent FLAPS, even.  The head studs are getting to be a bit of a
problem :-(  The originals were 8mm.  The original replacements were
stepped 8/9mm.  The recent posts seem to indicate that 8/10 is all that is
available today :-(  If you accept my suggestion of letting the machinist
do it, tho, he/she will supply the studs and it becomes an SEP (someone
elses problem :-)
