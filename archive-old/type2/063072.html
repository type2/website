Subject: Re: 74 rebuild, what to do?

        
        Well after everyone's encouraging comments like 'go for it', 'why
not', and 'its like playing with tinker-toy' I have decided to fix my zero
compression in once cylinder problem myself.  My problem now is to decide
what or what not to do.  Is a top-end rebuild enough or should I go for the
whole schmear; how do I decide?   What else should I look into ? She is a 74
Westy with 124K miles and in decent condition, the PO neglected her (nary a
valve adjustment or tune-up in a year), but the PPO had a VW mechanic son
who kept it in really good condition. AFter 22 years and 124K miles what
else might need a little TLC or should I just fix the compression problem.
My other question was how do I support the transmission when I drop the
engine, is a couple of stacks of bricks and a two by four enough?  

Thirdly does anyone know of anywhere in the Vancouver (B.C.) area where
parts are readily available, after hearing all of the J.C. Whipme stories
I'm not terribly keen on ordering through them. 

Thanks in advance.
