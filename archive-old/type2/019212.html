MUST SELL QUICK WILL MAKE GREAT DEAL.I WILL SELL ALL FOR $1500 OR SELL IT
FOR $1200 MINUS THE TENT .The bus does not run because the motor is pulled,
but I do have two motors
for it. One is a 1700cc and the other is a 2.0 lither with H lifters. The
1700 needs one of the pistons replaced, it has not been long since it was
rebulid but one of the pistons has a hole in it. The 2.0 just needs to be
put back together. It does not have any major body rust the only bad spot is
were the battery sets, and the metal will need to be replaced there. The
pans are in good shape. The curtains and the carpet need to be replaced but
the seats are in very good shape. It has the upper cot and the child's cot
and both are in very good condition. I also have a vw tent that is in good
shape and I am going to let go with the bus . I have a extra under the dash
ac unit and I have the fuel injector that goes with the 1700. I have tons of
extra parts for the engine that I will let go with it. The front windshield
is broken. All the lights and blinkers work. The back cabinet door needs a
hinge. If you have any questions or would like to see more pictures just let
me know. I'm live in Covington,TN about 40 min. north of Memphis. If you
want to see pictures goto http://www.geocities_dot_com/bltlawrence/Westy.html
