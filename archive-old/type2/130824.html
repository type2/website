Subject: Re: [VB] making a Bug engine fit a Bus with a hanger

Has anyone managed to use one of these brackets without massive oil 
leaks?  I needed to get a bus running on the double, so I used the 
bracket on a 1974 Super Beetle engine I had laying around.  Engine 
works great, but the oil leak is ugly at best.

&gt; J.C. Whitney (I washed my mouth out with soap) sells an adapter plate
&gt; that bolts to your oil pump in place of the cover and has a bracket tha
&gt; alligns with the three bosses
