&gt; Symptoms:  when I make a low speed hard right turn, like in the city or in a

&gt; It doesn't happen on a similar left hand turn.
&gt; 
&gt; It 'sounds' like a loose wire, but are the wipers and the head lights on the 
&gt; same circuit??


when I have a screwy electrical problem I take and wire an ampmeter into
the circuit I'm having trouble with, usually taking the fuse out and
wiring the ampmeter accross the fuse location, and then putting the
ampmeter in front of my face in the center of the dashboard.

carefull with the power, an inline fuse can be usefull
