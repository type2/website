Joel makes a good point!  In addition, you will need to install a
proportioning valve in the line to the rear brakes.  Else you will be
locking up the rears long before the front discs are engaged.

On the bolt pattern, as I understand it, VW changed the hole spacing on
the beam somewhere in the late 60s, early 70s that force all sorts of
gyrations to get disc brakes on a splittie.  You have to install a '68-&gt;?
beam and use the trailing arms from a disc brake bus ('71-&gt;'79?). I have
not done this, and don't exactly know the break years.
