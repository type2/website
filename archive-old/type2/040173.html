Subject: how to adjust float level in weber 34 ICT

can someone please tell me how to set the float levels in my 34 ICT webers,
and what the levels should be?

i think i have bad float levels in one or both of my carbs. the engine has
filled up with gas twice now. i had replaced the float needle and valve
assembly in the right carb after the float had appeared to be stuck,
thinking that it wasn't seating properly, but now that it's happened again,
i'm suspecting the level of fuel in the float bowl isn't getting high enough
to push the needle all the way up and close off the fuel delivery when my 74
bus is parked.

the floats don't have any gas in them, so i don't think their leaking (they
are both brand new carbs); it's not a gradual buildup of gas. i've been
checking the oil level every day and it's fine, but then overnight --
bam! -- an extra 2 or 3 quarts of gas is mixed in.

of course, i suppose another possibility is some crud keeps getting stuck in
the needle hole, so i've replaced the fuel filters.

any other ideas would be greatly appreciated.

cheers,
victor
