Listed for a friend- 76 Type 2, red and white, veee-ry clean body and
interior, 2000 cc rebuilt motor with a few thousand miles on it,
dis-assembled now, had problem with head (on motor) kept loosening up.
Local mechanic (?) took motor apart, owner picked up bus with motor in a
box.  Great project, I've seen this bus and it is clean.  $1500.
E-mail him direct at Tacomoose_at_hotmail_dot_com or call 318-396-5003.  Ask
for Brad.  Now you know as much as I do.

Of all the things I've lost, I miss my mind the most.
