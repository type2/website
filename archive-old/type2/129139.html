Subject: Thx everybody - Signing Off

I'll be bowing out Stage Left and wanted to acknowledge the fine 
community here.

I had joined just a short time ago to aid in finding a rescued Type 2 a 
new home and having successfully completed this task I'll be giving my 
email filters a break.

Thx to all, and to all a good night.
