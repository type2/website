&gt;So in his spare time he plays with American Iron, but for his full time gig,
&gt;he does VW customizing?  Isn't it ironic?  So VWs are the bread and butter
&gt;of what he does, but he can't make a living doing the hot rod customizing?
&gt;I don't really see why he would have gotten upset in the first place.  Funny
&gt;how little things get people's underpants all twisted around!

Funny, I could have sworn Sean killed this thread already.  That gets MY
underpants all twisted around.

This thread has no bus content and will therefore die right now, 5:22pm
central time U.S..   Further posts on this subject, or &quot;RE: meeting&quot; will
be cause for immediate and permanent removal from this list.  And don't get
mad at me, I'm just following the charter.
