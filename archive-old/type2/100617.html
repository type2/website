Subject: RE: [T2] Back door cargo rubber ?

  Jim Thompson (aka Old Volks Home, rubber knowledge extraordinaire) just
brought something to my attention. I laid the 2 rear hatch seals (64 to 71,
72 to 79) on top of each other and made measurements and the 64 to 71 is
wider at the top and longer on the sides then the 72 to 79 seal. Even more
differences then I noticed at first.

 There are distinct differences between the;
211 829 193C (1964 to 1971) and the 211 829 193E (1972 to 1979) rear hatch
seals.

 The 211 829 193C has sharper upper corners, a different profile (close but
a little different) and different notches on the bottom. The 211 829 193E
has  more rounded upper corners, different profile and different notches on
the bottom.

  I just went out to my storage lot and looked at both a 1971 and a 1972 bus
with original rear hatch seals and verified the fact. It does appear that
either seal would fit in any year of bay window and it really would be a
matter of how anal retentive you want to be concerning the seal.

  I do stock both numbers and they both have the VW logo and VW part number
molded in them. I do they get directley from a source from Germany and have
been told that these are made in Germany for VW.
  The 1950 to 1963 part number is 211 829 193 up to chassis no# 1 144 281

ps. The 211 829 193E are still available from your local VW dealer (cost
unknown).
