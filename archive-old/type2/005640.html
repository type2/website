Tim:

You can simplify everything by ordering our rebuilt torsion arms. They come
with new German ball joints already installed. $174.95 exchange for the set.

Thank You!

&gt; I have been keeping my ball joints going by greasing them but I am soon
going
&gt; to have to replace them since the boots are torn (really almost
nonexistent).
&gt;  How big a job is it?  What does it entail to do both sides?  How long
should
&gt; I expect to spend?  I have manuals but would appreciate any advice, hints,
&gt; pitfalls that await before starting.  Both sides, upper and lower need
&gt; replacing.
