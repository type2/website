Subject: Dormobile Gurus (splitty's) please!

I _might_ be getting a Dorm roof off a 70's bus and the guy that I _might_ get it from (already removed 
off the bay window bus) swears that it fits properly on his split. The bottom line is that I am thinking of 
putting the Dorm roof on my split.

Anybody know the _definitive_ answer on this, will a 70's Dorm roof fit on a split. If not what is it that 
would prevent it from working on a split?

Also anyone that owns a Dorm (are there many of you out there?) could you please get in contact with 
me, I have a few questions on how the Dorm roof goes together.
