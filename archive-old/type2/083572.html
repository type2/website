&gt; I'm not sure if the 71 is the same as my 73, but I found that some evil
&gt; previous owner had hammered up my filler spout pretty bad.  I had to
&gt; bend it flat and it sealed a little better.  I got a new locking cap
&gt; (Stant) and it sealed a little better yet (new sealing material) but I
&gt; still got some slosh-out on left hand turns.  That's when I got a
&gt; flashlight, don't use a match 8-) and found that there is a gradual
&gt; ledge that was bent over.  I used a paint can opener to grab the bottom
&gt; and bend it back into shape.  Now when I lock it down and twist a half
&gt; turn, it seals down nicely.

The '73 is different.  The '71 had that lovely big fill opening (you can
actually see the gas in the tank through it!) and the corresponding big
cap, which probably isn't available at the FLAPS.  The caps aren't all
that uncommon and should be available through VW suppliers or at swaps.  I
think that
they are the same as on early bugs, type III, etc.
