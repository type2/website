Subject: Re: safely sleeping in a van (was kids and seatbelts)

Back in our 71 camper days, the SO and I would sleep in the back while
the other was driving, no sweat.  80% of safety is in the driving-
safely and defensively....but there is still the element of other
unpredictable drivers or road hazards.  In the 71 I rigged up a chain
between the bed mounts and eyebolts mounted to the doubleroof above; it
was really to make a rear facing couch for drive-in movies, but could
also allow lying down back there with some safety against flying
forward. 
      When the daughter came 1n 1985 and we had a 78 Westy, she grew up
with it, using a baby seat in the reversed swivel seat or rear seat. 
She'd usually sleep in the baby seat, but once it got to the booster
seat, a few pillows against the door or rear sidewall could allow
sleeping with a seatbelt as most adults do now.   I did rig up the 78
bed to allow relative safety when fully extended by installing a nylon
barrier at the front of the seatbed- very easy: Put in 2 3/8&quot; eyebolts
through the roof edge by the upper bedboard.  Place a  steel rod through
the 2 brackets holding the seatbed front cushion/seat.  Sew a 1&quot; loop
into the ends of heavy duty nylon tarp that will span from the bar
underneath to the upper eybolts by using a chain with threaded links at
the upper end or a threaded rod with nuts at the ends.  I had styrofoam
panels on the rear door and sides to absorb any impact with our most
delicate part- the head.  The tarp barrier prevents the sleeper from
catapulting off the bed into the cabinets or front seats.  It all hides
easily under the seat.  If concerned about rollovers, rig up a lapbelt
that attaches to the sealtbelt points under the seat and goes over the
waist.  This alone might negate the need for the tarp barrier.

 On long trips do you let your kids out of their seat belts
 to do things.. I guess what I am asking is if it's night and
 they are wanting to sleep... Do you take them out of their
booster seats and let them sleep in the back?
