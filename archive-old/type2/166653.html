Subject: Re: [T2] Westy &quot;roof alignments&quot;

Hi Sid,

The first westfalias with a pop-top were the sub-hatch westys of the  
late 1950's. You could stand up and look outside, but there wasn't  
much freedom of movement. Later on the westy roof was based on a  
sunroof bus, and was hinged at the front with luggage rack on the  
back. This arrangement lasted (with minor alterations) until the end  
of the 1973 model year.

In the 1974-79 westfalia, the entire rear of the bus roof was re- 
engineered to allow a double bed to be installed upstairs. The  
luggage rack was moved up front and the hinge was placed at the back.  
Without the roofline being changed there is no way to allow the  
double bed upstairs, which is a major design feature of the 74-79  
campers.

In case you've never had the pleasure, here's a peek at what a 74-79  
westy looks like naked:

&gt; VW was going through a &quot;management issue&quot;, with &quot;Bigger players&quot;,
