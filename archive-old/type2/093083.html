Subject: Re: [T2] Don't scrap your Buses!

Working class neighborhoods like ours seems to work good regardless of 
where their ancestors comes from.

I wouldn't live in CA or VA for any extra money b/c of the stories I hear. 
I'll be happy right here in small town TN where you don't bother folks and 
they won't bother you either.

My parents live in a nice part of Chattanooga and they have an increasing # 
of regulations b/c there are folks with nothing better to do but worry 
about what the neighbors are doing with their own property. Parents' are 
moving over the hill to a small farming community where there is no 
regulations, no city water, and barely electricity! &lt;grin!&gt;

Good luck!
