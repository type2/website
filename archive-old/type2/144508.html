Subject: Re: [T2] acid rust removal

Please be aware that Muriatic acid and swimming pool
acid are TWO different things!  READ the ingredients
on the bottle marked 'Swimming Pool Acid'. 9 times out
of 10 it will be a mixture of hydrochloric acid AND
sulphuric acid. 


Muriatic acid is, if I remember from high school,
diluted hydrochloric acid. 32%  
And is available by itself.

I was using it to remove the rust from the battery
trays. I bought some muratic acid from Home Depot in
the pool cleaning section. If you can find a smaller
container than 1 gallon I would go for that instead.
They tend to sell you 2 gallons for about $7 which
is a lot of acid.
