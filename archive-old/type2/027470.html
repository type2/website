Hey Paul.

I bet Home Depot has one of those sunset or Time-life books on Formica 
repair. It would probably be in a kitchen remodel or cabinetry book.
I have a volume of these at home and I'll take a look.

I think the basic procedure would be to: peel off the rubber T-strip edging, 
peel off the Formica layer, use a scraper or chisel and/or adhesive 
dissolver to get the remaining bits. Keep a low angle, and the tool level, 
be careful not to gouge the wood

lay the table top face down on the up-side of the new formica and trace the 
shape 1/8&quot; larger on all sides.

use a razor or utility knife and straight edge to score the surface of the 
formica at the lines (for the corners, carefully freehand it if you dare, or 
use a circle guide or a round object with a matching radius)

Use a jigsaw with a formica blade to cut the formica piece. Clamp the 
formica to a board or work surface, with the cut line hanging no more than 
1/2&quot; over the edge of the surface (this keeps the thin Formica from flexing 
under the weight of the saw or the movement of the blade)

Cut JUST OUTSIDE of your scored line.  Put masking tape on the base of the 
jigsaw to prevent dark marks or scratches in the formica

Your new piece should be 1/8&quot; bigger than the table surface on all sides.

Clean the tabletop and sand with  80-grit paper. Clean and wipe with 
tack-cloth.

adhere the formica to the tabletop with a formica or paneling adhesive. Go 
by the recommendations of your hardware store rep. follow all instructions 
on the packaging.

use several clamps (I use QUICK-GRIPs, holding down strips of wood across 
the surface) to hold the formica to the wood, OR place the tabletp on a FLAT 
surface, cover with clean paper or cloth and put several heavy non-marring 
objects on it (I use full cans of paint sometimes, or a couple of 5-gallon 
water bottles, but you have to be sure the edges are all presed, because 
that's where it eventually lifts.

Let dry for appropriate time.

trim the extra 1/8&quot; flush to the edge with a router with a STRAIGHT bit with 
a bearing at the bottom. They make laminate trim bits, but they cut a 45 
degree bevel in the edge, and you want a straight edge to go right up 
against the T-molding. Put masking tape or felt pads on the router base to 
prevent scratching the formica surface

You can avoid the router part by cutting your formica flush to begin with, 
but you risk chips in your final piece along the cut-line, and less-than 
perfectly-straight lines. If you do the no-router way, trace your pattern on 
the underside of the formica and put masking tape on the good side along 
your cut line to reduce potential chips.

This is just a basic outline I made off the top of my head. I've never done 
this, but I worked in home improvement for 10 years and remodeleed my whole 
house. This is just to get an idea of the scope of the job. But I would bet 
it's pretty close to a thorough step-by-step.

The most important 2 things you can do (with any project) are:

1) TAKE YOUR TIME

2) get the right tools and materials.

95% of home improvement projects go wrong when someone rushes, or doesn't 
educate themselves on the right tools for the job.

only 5% is &quot;being handy&quot;

Clamp all work securely before cutting. Make sure you protect your surface 
with a clean shop cloth or old t-shirt material under your clamps


And as far as the T-strip goes, I've never taken one off, but I'd bet you 
can get a decent adhesive, applied sparingly in the groove, and put it back 
in there. I'd place wood strips along the edges and clamp it with bar clamps 
until it dries. set the t-strip in the sun for an hour first, so it's soft 
and pliable. My 69's t-strip has shrunken, leaving as much as  a 1-inch gap 
on the big table. I plan to remove, stretch and reapply it when I do my 
interior. Lucky for me, the formica is pristine.

Good luck.

Jason

PS: I'll check my library for that cabinet book

&gt;Hi folks, and happy spring to everyone in the northern hemisphere,

&gt;like to repair or replace the formica, but don't have a clue to working 
&gt;with
&gt;that kind of stuff.
&gt;   Can anyone recommend a book, web site, or other refrence for working 
&gt;with
&gt;laminates like that?   First hand advice would be great too.
&gt;Thanks in advance for the help.
&gt;
