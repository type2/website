Subject: Re: [T2] Heating possiblities


I dunno, just for fun has anyone tried fixing the stock system that came
with the bus?  I did and with the exception of one small connector pipe my
system is all there and in working order.  Know what?  It gets warm as
hell!  Well, at least it does at the rear seat vent.  By the time it gets
up front it's lukewarm.  Once you go faster than 20 or 30 it disappears due
to general bus leakage.  For the longest time I had read gmbulley's page
about Heat, Rust &amp; Noise in VWs and thought it would be great to do that to
my bus (78 Westy) but just wasn't motivated enough.  After a camping trip
to the Shenandoah's I changed my mind.  During the drive I watched our
Siberian Husky go from sitting on the rear seat to laying down on the rear
seat to finally laying curled up in a little husky-ball with her tail over
her nose.  For those of you that don't have a Husky this means that it's
cold and the dog is preparing to sleep and wake up in a snowdrift.

I did a half-assed job of insulating my bus and that made a huge difference
in heat (and noise).  I applied Q-pads to the front of the bus (nose, cabin
floor and doors), in the sliding door, over the engine compartment and
under the back seat.  I couldn't find the NASA stuff but I used Reflectix
insulation instead.  This stuff has different R values depending on how you
position it.  I covered the Q-pads with a layer of Reflectix and then
duct-taped it down.  In the nose of the bus I took fiberglass insulation
and stuffed all the nooks under the dash and the corners and replaced the
front panels.  Under the bus I replaced the ripped paper duct with some 4&quot;
aluminum ducting and covered that with some HVAC insulation.  I also
installed an Atwood bilge blower at the front of the duct and wired it to a
switch on the dash.  I did actually get under the bus and adjust the
flappers (they were NOT all the way open) but that's it.

The most obvious thing I noticed was how much quieter the van was at
highway speeds.  It's like being in a different vehicle.  It's much warmer
too although I still have some nasty drafts up front.  I sealed the front
vent which helped but I think I need to replace my door seals.  The bus
gets toasty if you sit at a light though!  My heater cables broke so I
think when I replace them I'm going to do a few more things to improve
heat.  Things I'm planning on doing are: put that header wrap stuff on the
exhaust, insulate the flapper ducts, insulate the plastic accordian ducts
coming out of the exchangers, insulate the ducts under the front of the
bus, insulate the belly pan area under the front of the bus, insulate the
sliding door, add a duct to feed the rear heat blower air from the inside
of the bus (maybe from the vent that already exists near the floor in the
fridge cabinet?) and maybe add another fan for the very front of the bus.
That's a pretty long list so I'm sure some stuff will drop off.  I just had
a thought about vapor barriers.  You know how the normal barrier is thin
plastic and how GMbulley recommends using the thickest plastic you can find
for a vapor barrier?  Well what if you used &quot;space blanket&quot; material for a
vapor barrier?  It's just mylar after all but it reflects heat amazingly
well if there's an air space.  You can by cheap versions in Target or
Sports Authority in the camping section.  They come in those green packages
along with all the other last-minute camping items you need.  I might try
this on my sliding door since they're so cheap.

That's it for now.
