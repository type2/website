&gt; ......&lt;
&gt; Materials needed:
&gt; Nickel Chromium wire, 30 AWG
&gt; ......&lt;
&gt; Where do you find 30 guage Ni-chrome?? Start at appliance
&gt; repair shops, since ni-chrome is used in electric dryer
&gt; heating elements.  If they don't have 30 AWG, they can
&gt; probably tell you where to get it.

Hobby stores that deal with radio control airplanes might have some as well.
People who make their own airplanes use nichrome hot wire to cut the foam
cores for the wings.

In a similar vein: Is there any place to get a replacement rear window for a
'76 that has the defroster?  Someday I'll be moving to a colder climate and
will want that nicety.  Also, it seems the nichrome trick would be good for
the front window under the wipers to supplement the stock VW 'heat'.

Later,
Niall (Frances '76 Westy)
