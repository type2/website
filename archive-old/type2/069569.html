Skip, 
Be sure you deal with Mark Stephens, not Stephens Machining. Two COMPLETELY
different companies. I've got a horror story of my own about Stephens Machining.
The engine still runs, leaks oil, tho. Customer service  from the time I
finished the initial order went totally to crap. The engine wasn't built to the
agreed specs, but since I didn't want to ship it back to CA from VA, I went
ahead and used it. It was also missing pieces, some of which they sent to me
after I called them about it. Some they didn't. The engine dropped a valve at
about 25,000 miles (keepers came off, could've been my fault due to high revs).
My opinion, FWIW.
