Subject: Re: [T2] One version of why we are &quot;orphans&quot; of VW

Ron, that was a most excellent letter. VW ought to get a copy. I must
say though, that the only time I ever bought a new vehicle off the
dealer lot, it was for a 1985 Vanagon, and I was treated like a king
by the service dept at Niello VW and also by the other one I don't
recall when we were stationed there in the military.

Also the question nobody asked reminds me of an article from Popular
Mechanics I just read on the Bugatti development. Also funny you
mentioned Lancia. We just watched Herbie goes to Monte Carlo for the
first time tonight and were wondering about the Lancia!
