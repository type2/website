Subject: Re: Dual Solex Carbs for sale 
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hi.  On the subject of Weber Progressives and poor performance:

My bus is a '79   I had it from '90 to '93, sold it, and bought it back in
'97.    The other owner had ripped out the (beautiful) 2.0FI and replaced
it with a '73 (1.7) engine with an old weber progressive carb.  Ran crappy.
 I figured I would eventually find another 2 liter and some FI parts, but
in the meantime, I got the carb rebuilt this summer and...
	Now it runs just like new.  Great power, good reaction (no apparent lag
between hitting the gas and it moving), starts on the first crank in below
freezing weather (we had just a little of that in the Akron area so far
this year), and no icing problems.  And it idles beautifully.  I think I'll
forget the 2.0L FI engine.  This setup gets the job done just fine.  
	I think it was Bob Hoover (correct me if I'm wrong) who said that a weber
progressive would kick the pants off (paraphrase) of dual kadrons.  From
what I've seen, If you're tuned up nice, this setup can run near as good as
the FI, and is much simpler and cheaper to fix if something goes wrong.
And no balancing of Solexes...

						Just my three cents.
