Subject: Re: [T2] Rubber doughnuts through the tin

     I may have made a mistake on the quanity of donuts and the types I have. I was browsing at home and do not have access to my 
inventory
and part numbers. I know I have 132 of one donut (were doing year end inventory), but do not know how many others I may have.
   I am sorry if I got anybodys hopes up and will post here again as to exactly what's in stock and/or available on Monday ot Tuesday.

Thanks Karl for pointing this out to me, insert foot in mouth.

&gt;&gt;The big rubber seals that go where the fresh air hoses pass through the 
&gt;&gt;tin are still NLA. What are people using to seal these? Blue goo?
