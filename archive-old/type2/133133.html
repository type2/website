Subject: Re: [T2] Getting to know my bus

Dean,

I can probably help with the carb,  filter nipple is probably for
the line that goes to the oil breather...really wouldn't want to say for 
sure unless you have a picture.

Other line might be a vacuum takeoff....

Need pics

Cheers, dave

&gt; ~Carb
&gt; There's a nipple right under the filter (facing back, above left-not
&gt; the fuel line) which has no tube or plug.
&gt; There a tube coming from right below the carberator facing the rear of
&gt; the engine which is blocked with a golfing tee.
&gt; Carb is Holley with codes &quot;L6503 2870&quot; on aluminum plate near filter.
&gt; Let me know if posting a picture would be helpful.

&gt; Would you drive 10 miles to camp this weekend?
