Every Volkswagen ever made always has used a coil with a built in 
resistor.  Is that statement strong enough?  ANY mechanic or parts 
person should know the answer to that question.
Until the situation arises, owners won't know.  If one goes to a VW 
literate parts/repair place, they don't even ask the question, it's a 
given.

I spent MONTHS and MUCH dollars trying to track down problems 
relating to installation of a non-resistance type coil into my bus by 
a crazed mechanic.  Need a LONG list, just ask.  Ignorance allowed me 
to have an improper one installed, along with pressure by shop that 
towed me off freeway in Phoenix AZ at rush hour.

NO catalog of parts should EVER list a non-resistor coil for a VW.  
That's WHY they have a catalog, to tell US what the correct part 
should be.  Find a shop that deals with Bosch components and forget 
other brands, unless you have some after market system installed. 

BTW, if VW ever used a non-resistor coil, FLAME ME big time, but post 
to the list to inform all. 

Only vehicle I ever had with a external resistor was a Sunbeam Alpine, 
had a hard time figuring out what that strange coily wiry thingy was 
hangin out in space was hangin onto the coil, but it had Lucas 
electronics, so . . . .

Good choice on getting the one WITH, Barry, or could you tell!

&gt; So... I'm at my favourite Canadian Tire looking for a coil for Folly's 
&gt; new/old motor, and the guy says, &quot;Is that with or without the internal 
&gt; resistor?&quot;

&gt; &gt; Geeze?  Do I need an internal resistor or not ??  HELP.  $36.00 I paid 
&gt; for the coil!  &lt; With the internal resistor.  I flipped a coin!  Was I 
&gt; right???&gt;
