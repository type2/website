Subject: Motoroil and specific heat (Ed Hackett)

There has been some talk recently about air-cooled engines running
cooler with some oils than with others. So I asked Ed Hackett for his
opinion; he is the author of a motoroil FAQ that has been widely
distributed over the internet. I'm forwarding this with his
permission.

Sorry to take so long getting back to you, but work is keeping me out of 
the office about three weeks a month.

I ddon't have any specific information on specific heat other than the 
synthetics perform much better as coolants.  This is due to two effects, 
both a better heat transfer capability and less heat produced in the  
first place, due to lower internal friction.

I've seen the oil temp drop a bit more than 30 degrees F in a Bug  by 
switching form GTX to Valvoline Synthetic.

Any of the full syntetics should help lower the oil temp.  Mobil 1 15w-50 
is a good value, and easy to find.
