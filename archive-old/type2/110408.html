Subject: Re: [T2] How did you restore your front kick panels?

&lt;&lt; I want to put the front kick panels back in my 76 Westy; however, they are 
in
sad shape. I am going to use the old ones as a template, but I'm unsure of
what material I should use as the &quot;board&quot;?The original is that hard cardboard
stuff. I can't find anything like that. What about thin plywood like luan
(sp)? &gt;&gt;

Luan'll work as well as anything...But give them a couple of coats of thinned
varnish/polyurethane, especially on the cut edges to seal the wood from
moisture...
