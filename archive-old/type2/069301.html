Subject: brake upgrade for 69 bus

Hello all,

I am wworking on designing a 4 disc brake setup for my 69 bus, and I am  
mixing and matching parts from later years. I currently have a 71 partss 
bus and I have a line on parts from a 1979. I need some info from you 
knowledgable folks about the brakes and suspension starting in 1971.

1&gt; I know you can put 71 suspension  parts on a 69, but how about 72 and 
later parts? will the front axle from a 72 &amp; later fit in a 69? 

2&gt; Also, what is the difference in brakes between a 71 and 72 and later 
years? I think they just used a slightly larger calpier with a thicker 
brake pad but I am unsure.

TIA

anyone interested in what I am doing please ask for info if you want, I 
have done this previously with a  Datsun Z car (changed to 4 wheel disc 
brakes, upgrades all 4 corners with good success) and the 69 bus looks 
like a good candidate for an  upgrade of some sort.
