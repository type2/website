External oil cooler with fan.

Did they REALLY remove the stock fan from inside the shroud? What
you've got there cools the oil but not the cylinders/heads. I'm
surprised the motor was OK with that even for 100 miles if the stock
cooling fan is really gone.
Lean into the engine compartment and reach your hand around the side
to the big hole right in front of the alternator (front is toward
FRONT OF BUS) (it's a TIGHT fit, use the wife if her hands/arms are
smaller &lt;grin&gt;). See if you feel the blades of a squirrel cage type
fan inside that hole. Squirrel cage fan is the type that looks like a
cylinder with slots around the outside edge rather than 'flat' blades
in the middle like the one in your pictures so you have to reach your
fingers sideways in the hole like you're grabbing hold to pull the
shroud off -- should feel a bunch of close spaced &quot;slots&quot;. I'll bet
it's still there.
I suspect what they did was remove the stock OIL COOLER and go with
the external unit only. That could work OK if you can duct it to get
air from outside and blow it BACK outside. Right now if they have the
fan &quot;sucking&quot; air into the engine comaprtment then it's making things
hotter by sucking the air through the hot oil. If they have it
'blowing' from the engine compartment toward the outside then a)it's
using warm engine compartment air to try to cool the oil and b)it
fighting a losing battle by blowing against the air being sucked IN by
the &quot;elephant ear&quot; vents.
Missing front engine to body seal -- bad thing.

Since you're pulling the motor anyway -- repaint all the tin black.
Silver/chrome tends to reflect radiant heat -- whether it does so
enough to actually raise engine temps is a religious war that should
probably not be discussed.
