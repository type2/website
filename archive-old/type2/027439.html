Subject: The Dreaded Lurch....

I’m going to try to explain my problem, but please forgive my ability to 
describe it better.  I have a 74 Transporter (no FI) that has been subject 
to visits from the very scary Lurch.  Lurch first attacked us only hours 
after meeting.  We were on the Interstate during a 5 hour trip (3 hours in). 
  My headlights would dim, and I would lose nearly all power until finally 
having to shift into first to rev the motor out the roof.  After hitting 
first, I was always able to get more speed and return to normal speed for a 
while until Lurch joined us again, always near an exit where I would usually 
pull off with a 100% dead bus.  The motor usually wouldn’t start again until 
after a long sit.  Well, I:

     Bought a new AVP longblock (1800cc with hydraulic lifters!) I have not 
yet installed
     Installed a Pertonix ignition
     Replaced the starter and solenoid
     Replaced the battery
     Replaced the spark plugs
     Installed a hard start relay
     Used Chemtool to clean my fuel system,  AND

I already had a:

     New distributor and plug wires
     New fuel pump
     New Weber progressive
     New alternator, BUT

Lately the bus has been sputtering on acceleration (while making a chirpy 
sound through the exhaust) and LURCH joined us once again tonight on the way 
home from the grocery (note: coldest night since spring).  Oh it was 
frightening.  The Lurch was truly dreaded this time.  I put the bus into 
neutral, and revved the motor to high rpm’s for a while, and then Lurch 
left, but the sputtering continued.  It always feels like the engine is 
badly flooded or something and that by revving it I’m unflooding the system. 
  Does that make sense? Anyone have any hints?  Do I have to install the 
longblock to eliminate all mechanical possibilities?  Help me keep faith in 
my VW addiction. Oh please! Oh please!

Thanks,
Dustin
