Subject: Re: [T2] waxing  pop-top hinges

I would try using basic paraffin wax. You can most likely find it at any
craft store or stores that cary canning supplies. I think they sell it in
small blocks. Automotive wax would not leave a thick enough layer. Cross
country ski wax might work but I think that the paraffin would work better,
its basicaly just candle wax.

Subject: [T2] waxing pop-top hinges


&gt; I could be mistaken - but I thought that the Westy Camper Manual that came
&gt; with my 78 spoke of waxing the pop-top hinge - I guess it could have been
&gt; something else but I'm quite sure it said 'waxing.'  My question is - with
&gt; what do I wax it?  Automotive wax?  Cross-country Ski wax?  What?  It
moves ok
&gt; - but I suspect that it could slide easier.
&gt;
&gt; TIA
