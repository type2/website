Michael,

I know you said you wouldn't change the 'drip pan' but, unless 
someone can confirm that you're on the right path with your milling 
of the case, you might have to consider it. 

I had to cut a hole in the 'drip pan' to allow clearance for the 90 
degree fitting and wasn't happy with it. So, next time I had my 
engine out I fashioned a piece of galvanised metal (it was all I had 
around) to cover the hole and clear the fitting. I pop riveted the 
new piece to the drip pan (with silicone rubber sealant as well) and 
painted it to match the rest of the tin. If I had had the tools and 
the skill I might have been able to braise (sp?) the new piece in
place and made the job look invisible. As it is, the work I did 
doesn't sort of stand out in your face but it's noticeable if you 
have a good look at the engine tin. Painting it black helps.

If you are able to mill and tap the case you're obviously not a 
stranger to the workshop so all I'm suggesting is that modifying 
the drip pan is something you should not dismiss completely. 

My .02c worth.


Ian
