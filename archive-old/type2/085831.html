Subject: is anyone going to North vs. South Show in Darlington???

Is anyone going to the North vs. South Shootout Show this weekend in 
Darlington, SC at the speedway.

I havn't been before, but from what others have said, there aren't a ton of 
buses there, but there is excellent swap meet with plenty-o-parts for the 
pickin'.

If any of you listees are planning to go, please email me, I love to meet 
other listees in real life!!!

if you want info about this event you can goto their web page:

peas,
BUDDAH
