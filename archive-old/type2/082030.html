Subject: Everybus pics

Hello all,

Had a great time at Everybus...so great in fact that I didn't take nearly as
many pics as I wanted to. I took 127, but ask all who took pics to send them
to me for the website.
I will work on it today, but it usually takes a while to choose pics and
post them all. Of course I can also add a link to your pics. I will give
credit where I can.

I have a cable connection so I can handle larger emails with pics attached.

Glad to meet so many new people and of course all you guys I always hang out
with.  :)
