X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

One possibility is to have stuff shipped UPS to someone in Wa. and then have
them ship to you USPS, may add some to the total cost, but less than UPS. Or
get a US PO box right over the border and have stuff shipped there, then go
get the stuff.I bet many people do this

Thanks John, as per usual you are right! I had some outdoor equipment
shipped up here via UPS and they hit me with a 30 dollar brokerage fee!!!!
Needless to say if it doesn't get shipped USPS I don't buy it. A lesson here
for Canadians, and I'm glad to see that you know this, many companies in the
US don't and then give us Canucks a hard time for asking for USPS.

&gt; we regularly ship to Canada. We also ship USPS, which doesn't always
collect
&gt; duty, UPS ALWAYS collects it.
