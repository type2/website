pootling around town, nothing harsh. engine started from cold 2 minutes ago
and the oil light blinks, a minute later, on and off again, drove home slowly,
oil light didnt come on again, what madness is this?

I'll be re-checking the oil-level tommorow, it may be lowish. Can this be
related to corners or hills? The oil light always comes on at first click on
the ignition so its not faulty wiring.
