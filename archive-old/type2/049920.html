Subject: RE: [T2] roof vibrating

This past summer I replaced the luggage rack &quot;not really a seal&quot; seal on my
76 Westy and now it does the same thing at speeds around 70-75 or with a
headwind.  The old seal appeared to be an actual seal and it had trapped a
lot of trash around the inside bottom edge of the luggage rack portion of
the pop top.  The new &quot;not really a seal&quot; seal only covers the edge of the
fiberglass and it doesn't trap debris but it howls like a lovesick coyote.
I've tried adjusting the top to eliminate the gap and the bolts are tight,
but no luck.  Like Todd I would like some suggestions.  Thanks.

Subject: [T2] roof vibrating

This past summer
while driving my 74 Westy from Seattle to Oklahoma, when the winds would hit
it from just the right side the front part of my Fiberglass roof would start
howling vibrating the fiberglass until I would either slow down or the wind
would change direction. Now I did take it off this past spring, clean it all
out under there and put a new seal around it. Any ideas on how to stop this
deaffing vibration? I tried tightening the bolts in the front but am scared
to over tighten them. Any ideas will be considered this spring.......Cant
wait to go camping here in Oklahoma.
