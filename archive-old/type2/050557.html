Subject: [T2] Points vs. Electronic Ignition
Content-Disposition: inline

Was wondering if those who have replaced their points with an electronic ignition would care to comment on the process and proformance after the installation.  I have had some problems recently with my points (you know if I just bought a new set instead of filing away on them) and was curious.  New points are $2.00 to $3.00, electronic ignition kits are $65.00+, is it worth the additional cost.  

Thanks
