Subject: location of dimmer relay

On my '71 Westy, I need to get at the dimmer relay because I am going to
install my own momentary switch to toggle the high/low beams. I read in
Bentley that this relay is located behind the fuse block. Can someone tell
me in detail how to remove this block?

Thanks,  Jack
