In *theory* this is simple.  On the early buses (?up to '72?) you need to
remove 4 screws, after that you only need to remove one.  The screws are
at the top holding the hinges, semi-hidden under the gasket.  That's the
easy part, finding them.  The hard part is getting them out.  they are
*not* welded into place, altho if you try to remove them with a standard
phillips head screwdriver you will certainly think they are!  the tool for
this job is an impact screwdriver.  J.C Whitney sells one (see:
http://www.jcwhitney_dot_com/product.jhtml?CATID=5532), but so does pretty
nearly any FLAPS.
