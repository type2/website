&gt; Come join us in beautiful, historic Harpers Ferry.  Only 66 miles from 
&gt; Washington DC and 68 miles from Baltimore.  Baltimore and DC Metro folk, 

getting iffy, got my new torque converter but I have to get it in and it
is calling for rain this weekend and I leave on a family/business trip to
the west coast Thur, and I won't get back until the evening of the 17th

not coming in wife's S*turn......

&gt; it's a VW camp out only a stones throw away!!  There are folks coming from 
&gt; Canada (Rumor has it possibly 4 buses). So spend a few more hours in your 
&gt; bus before it gets tucked in for the winter. Call KOA now to make your 

tucked in for the winter,,, real bus folks drive all winter, these buses
go like the dickens in the snow!  (ok I have a gas heater)
