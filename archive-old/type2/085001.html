For all those running type1 engines, please get ahold of a nice
40 horse fuel pump, to carry as a spare--so you do not wind
up having to buy some POS plastic fuel pump at the FLAPS,
when need suddenly arises.  Gene Berg carries new ones, while
used ones can be found at VW swaps for $2-$5, and rebuild
kits at Wolfsburg West.

&gt;2)  The 'GEN' light doesn't come on anymore.  Not sure
&gt;what wire's not connected anymore.....

Get out your multimeter and Bentley Manual wiring diagram.
You may just have a dead bulb.  PITA to replace.
