Subject: My van is eating batteries

Ashley's battery stopped holding a charge a couple of months ago - if I
didn't drive him every 3-4 days there wasn't enough juice to start. A quick
re-charge sorted the problem for a while. The battery was under warranty so
I just assumed I had a duff one and replaced it.

This was fine for a couple of months but the problem has re-appeared. Same
symptoms.

I have a voltmeter and it shows 12-13V while running and drops to 11V with
the engine off. Leave it for a few days and the voltage drops to 8V and
it's time for a charge.

I suspect a charging fault as very occasionally the red light doesn't go
off when the engine starts. Fanbelt is fine and the oil temp is not going
up so the fan (and hence the generator) is turning. Reving the engine
doesn't do the job but stoping and re-starting normally does. Problem is
much worse in wet weather.

Ashley is a 1971 UK, type 1 engined van. Anyone any suggestions ?

Phil Parker
