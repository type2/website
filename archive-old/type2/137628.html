&gt; Build a splash shield to keep it dry. Send the heated air through the

Is suspect the outside of the heater is cool to the touch, so no, it 
doesn't scare me.  The wood bottom of the cabinet would be taken out so 
that the heater sits on metal.  I would use the bottom as a shelf to 
cover the heater once it is installed.
