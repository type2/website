Subject: Re: [T2] Where to buy fuel line clamp

BTW, Richard, I passed Cupertino twice this week - I drove the Westy
from Santa barbara to a meeting in Davis, and, as always, was shocked
by the lack of type 2's on the highway.

On the entire 780-mile round trip, I saw *no* type 2's on the freeway
(briefly glimpsed one on surface streets when I was gettingn gas), and
only one Vanagon.

Where are they all going?? (rhetorical question - I think I already
know the answer, unfortunately...)

I also managed to get thru' 4 quarts of oil on that trip - I've got a
leak from the front seal. Maybe there'll be one less bus on the highway
for a while... :-(

&gt; &gt;Can you point me to any suitable valves? Presumably they need to be
&gt; &gt;specially rated for fuel use?
&gt; 
&gt; I used a regular pumbing store valve for several years. It worked
&gt; fine but when I removed it I found that the rubber seals inside has
&gt; deteriorated.
