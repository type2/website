Subject: Re: [T2] Broken into again. (fed up)

So thats my question to  everyone..... What can i do to
&gt;stop this without spening alot of money?

I would get a dog.

Seriously.

Oh, and i never lock my bus but i built a wooden box thing that is wedged 
between the front seats and locks and that's where i put my tools or laptop 
and valuables.
