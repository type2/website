Hi Volks,
        I'm in a big project, just don't have the time to read the all the
mail. I'll be back.

ps: Just to keep this VW, I had a '59 once that wouldn't start. Crank over
real nice until the batt ran out, just wouldn't start. I could push start
it, worked good like that.  Tried most everything, asked experts, lot's of
ideas...nothing worked. 
        The batt turned out to need lot's of water, all 3 cells. Seemed it
had enough juice to crank it but not enough to crank and fire. I used a
mirror to check the water after that. 
        Live and learn .
        Rob.
