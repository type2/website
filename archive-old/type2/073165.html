&gt;That amount of goodness was amazing to me, but in all honesty the fact that

What is also rather amazing is the amount of food Charlie can consume at
one sitting while he is gadding about the country. 8) Steve ain't no sloch
either.

Looks to me like you have two separate proposals:

1. An information problem. &quot;I broke down, who can help me?&quot; We can address
this pretty easily through an opt-in guestbook type script. It only needs a
czar, we'll give you plenty of technical help/webspace but we won't be in
charge of it.

Note: If you consult Steve Dolan at the end of his trip you may find that
finding Internet access became just as important as finding honest
mechanics/friendly listees. You can get it at Kinko's but is ain't cheap.
You can get it at some public libraries, but not most. I think &quot;access&quot;
deserves its own category, along with &quot;mechanics&quot; and &quot;friendlies&quot;. If I
get in trouble on the road I do not want a mechanic and I do not want
somebody to commiserate, I want access to the type2 list and I want it now.

2. A money problem. &quot;My engine blew up and now I can't get home&quot;. I am so
torn. Hooper is the very last person who can EVER dispute the generosity of
the list. But he is a skeptic through and through so he has to ask this:

Say we rack up $1250 or so in donations, of which $100 will be mine. Some
listmember-in-good-standing puts a rod through his case in Death Valley
while on vacation so we buy him a new AVP longblock. Everybody feels groovy.

But then the money is gone, and the breakdowns don't stop, and somebody
else blows an engine, and the *second* time you ask people for another
donation two weeks later, they are going to get awfully quiet. And the
third time they are going to ask you, why should it work here if it don't
work in North Korea?

Note: Charlie may remember that when he was staying here, we thunk up a
list discount for &quot;roadside assistance&quot; which is the modern euphemism for
&quot;fat sweaty tow truck driver&quot; and we called AAA and tried to talk them into
it. Well, actually Charlie called them. And they didn't want any part of
it. But nevertheless this may be the way to go. =^ )

Perhaps an insurance company would consider a policy in which you pay (say)
$75 a year, against a maximum claim of (say) $1500. That's not nearly
enough to overhaul a Ford but maybe it is enough for a Bus Pilot to get a
longblock delivered and install it himself.

I dunno if the Engines of Capitalism would go for it, but maybe. Anybody
out there an insurance agent? (Hah!) Also, I do think that whatever it is
we ought to include the British/Euro contingent and the Oceania contingent
because they have posted just as much help per capita as we have over the
years, we being the US/CA axis. But negotiating all these jurisdictions
would not be easy...
