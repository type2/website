Subject: Volkswagen Inventory parts Program

I am currently working on a software program that is to be used on personal
computers. It will be compatible with all 486 + machines..(sorry MAC
users)...and it is simply a way to keep track of the dozens of parts that we
all have buried in our garages, shops, spare rooms and such.

It is intended for personal use only and I would like to know what kind of
need there is and if you guys\girls have any interest in this sort of thing.
I am just sick of people calling me and I am not sure what I have lingering
around the house and the storage unit...

The user is able to input a parts number, description and quantity of parts
at any time, and the databas is searchable by part number or name to
instantly show what is available at YOUR house....

Email me if you are interested.....
