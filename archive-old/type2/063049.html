&gt; OK, here's one for you.
&gt; 
&gt; My friend Cheryl just called me and said she had a slight problem with Gus,
&gt; her 76 Westfalia.  She was turning around in a driveway and heard a loud
&gt; bang and lost her steering.  The guy who owned the driveway came out to see
&gt; what was the problem, felt around a bit and declared something to be broken,
&gt; but the tie rods were ok.  
&gt; 
&gt; The bus is on the other side of town from me, so I won't get to look at it
&gt; until tomorrow.  I don't know much about the steering mechanism (yet) so I
&gt; would appreciate just a few pointers on what to look for when I get there,
&gt; or if this has happened to somebody before, maybe there's a way we could fix
&gt; it on the fly to get it home.
&gt; 

I have stopped to help two early 70's breadloafs with these symptoms
over the summer.  In both cases it was the shaft up through the relay
lever that had sheared off.  When I towed one of the busses into a VW
shoppe just outside of Trois-Rivieres, the mechanic said that this
shaft breaking was becoming a fairly common occurrence on older loafs.

I immediately imagined [as did those I towed], this shaft breaking
at highway speed and the bus pitching as both wheels turned hard to
one side.  The fellow went on to say that all cases he had
seen...save one.. had occurred at slow speed [i.e in a driveway or
while parking on the street] when the wheels hit the curb while fully
cranked to one side or the other.

Though he told I that he had never seen this on a split, I crawled
under Ras Bulli Split right there in his parking lot to have a boo at
my 30 yr old steering assembly [took the grease gun in with I and gave
the link pins a good lube to boot].

Check the shaft that goes up through the relay arm...let I know if
this is the problem as i would be interested in gathering further
information on this phenomenom.

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Splits...Oh, my!
