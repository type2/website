&lt;&lt; I have weighed the pros and cons and at this point the threat of running
 afoul of our wonderful and always fair police force outweighs the benefits
 of traveling with a firearm, for me anyway. &gt;&gt;
the problem seems to be that officer friendly often sees that  the possession 
of a firearm turns you into a felon rather than someone exercising his 2nd 
amendment right. Goes right back to the discussion of personal responsibility 
Vs the mindset that society will take care of me and big government knows 
best. Unfortunately the psycho who's depriving you of your constitutional 
rights by taking your life has already figured out the lie that the 
government cant protect you, it can only avenge you after your dead. For 
myself, I'll place my faith in mssr's Smith and Wesson and let God sort it 
out. One thing to keep in mind though if you do choose to carry a sidearm, is 
that it is a tool, not a toy to be flashed around or talked about, a tool 
like any other except in this case it use is to kill. So keep it out of sight 
and when officer friendly asks you if you mind if he searches you car, tell 
him politely of course you do.
