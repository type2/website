Subject: Re: [T2] Locking engine hatch, el-cheapo

If you want a real cheap engine hatch lock,, use a fence gate latch hardware,
you pick what you like the best, as a couple versions will work, I like the
sliding pin one

Mount it vertically on the hatch door, fasten a cable to it, drill a small hole
in the tin, so you can run the cable into the cargo portion, just inside the
rear hatch door, 

when you close the door, it will latch, and you have to open the rear hatch to
pull the cable to release the hatch door

If you want to get really elaborate,, search the pick and pulls for an electric
trunk release, and mount it the same way,, then wire a switch on the dash to
release the latch
