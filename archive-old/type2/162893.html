Subject: Brazilian carb

	My '73 Devon has a carb with no significant markings except a 
big broad W cast on the rear side.  I'm reliably informed it's made 
in Brazil.  Ordinary cleaning methods  - not just compressed air but 
also scraping  -  still left me with no pilot jet function: no idle, 
no fuel till above ca. 1/3 throttle.  So the old crude method was 
tried: rev to ca.3,000 rpm, hold hand over air horn till motor almost 
stalls; remove hand; repeat cycle.  This classic procedure worked.  I 
assume there must have been not just a chunk of firt but a flake of 
varnish somewhere in the idle eqpt  ...
	Has anyone studied the vacuum takeoff on this carb?  Does it 
differ from the original Solex?  My ulterior motive is of course 
finding where to slap in the water.
