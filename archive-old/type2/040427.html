Subject: Even more ridiculous general questions......

Thanks to all who've replied to me so far, It's been a big help, It's 
wonderful to see so many nice knowledgable people.  I have a few more things 
to ask, as I'm going to start the restoration progress of &quot;George&quot; in about a 
week (Where is that Bus name page anyway?).  

1. The transaxle's got a thin layer of oil around the bottom (Nothing major, 
just slow seepage).  Try as I might, I can't get that plug out to see if I'm 
low....any special tools or tricks?

2. The sheet metal question.  I've decided to do a sheet metal and battery 
tray replacement on the right rear corner panel, instead of dealing with the 
bondo.  Any ideas about labor costs?  I know I can get quality panels from 
the Bus Depot.

3. Tachometer- I'd like to get a tach so I can see how many rpm's I'm pushing 
on the free way.  The instrument  panel has a blank hole in it on the right 
side, but I haven't seen any guages to fit it-also, i'd like the tach to be 
pretty cheap and easy to install-any ideas?

Trying to finally get up to speed
