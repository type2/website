Subject: I'm REALLY frustrated.

Hi  Folks,
I'm at my ends wits right now.  Here's the scenario.  My '71 ( AK engine ) 
ran like crap five months ago.  I couldn't adjust #3 valve so I let it 
sit.  I replaced the heads, spark plugs, ignition, set the timing (009 at 
7.5 BTDC statically).  It won't idle.  I noticed a crack in the vacuum hose 
to the brake booster so I replaced it.  How do I check if I have a vacuum 
leak else where?  I believe its the carb.  I check the idle air screw (big 
one) and it's two turns out.  What else can I do.  My family are suppose to 
go camping today  but....  Thanks in advance.

Joy Thru Air,
