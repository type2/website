Hey there Guys and Gals,

I've been shopping for an ignition coil for my 80 Vanagon Camper with 2.0 lt.
ac engine and would like to stick with the stock coil.  I've been quoted for a
BLUE, GOLD, and BLACK Bosch ignition coil.  When I ask the difference I get
&quot;Well, they're all 12 V with internal resistor and the only difference is the
color of the case.&quot;  I called 3 different part houses in town and nobody knew
the difference.  Oh, BTW, none were made in Germany (I'd prefer original
German coil).  
What's the deal?  I can't imagine this was done for aesthetic reasons : )  
Anyway, for a stock engine would it be worth the xtra bread to get a beefier
coil?  And if so what do ya recommend?  What else would I havta change?

I'm still searching the archives for the color difference but would appreciate
any answers or recommendations yall may have.

Thanks tons,

Don (SkyCruizer)
