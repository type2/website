FYI... final consensus seems to be that the Costco Kirkland $48 tires
are fine if your needs are low-end &quot;C&quot; load.  If you had a type IV
powered Westy (heavier engine + camper stuff), I would suggest a &quot;D&quot;
load tire... but for those (like my purchase) who can get by with
1435lbs _at_ 50PSI capacity, these are fine.  And they are &quot;All Season&quot;
with M+S rating, allowing me to cross the Cascade mountains &lt;grin&gt;.

Bill,
Unfortunately Yokohama does not produce the Y370 with a reinforced
construction any longer.
