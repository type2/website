Subject: Re: [T2] 5 speed gearbox

From Lima:
 
 I heard also, that for the regular 4 speed gearbox,
the flywheel should be a Type 1 model. What kind of
modifications it will be subjected, and for a possible
5 speed gearbox with a CU engine what kind of flywheel
can be used?
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

No, a type 1 flywheel is held on by a single large bolt. 
Your CU engine should have 5 bolt holes in the end of the crank.
You need a type 4 flywheel. 

They come in 3 sizes: 210mm, 215mm, and 228mm.

You need either the 210mm or 215mm flywheel for a 72-75 002 trans.
You need the 228mm flywheel for the 76-79 091 trans.
Both are 4 speeds.

I am not sure if I ever heard of anyone putting a 80+ Vanagon [T3] side shift trans in a bay bus [T2].
