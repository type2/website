Subject: Re: Oil temp sender/sump plate

These are probably stupid newbie questions, so please bear with me as I 
learn...

Given all the talk about inconsistent temp readings from sump plate temp 
sensors, would it be better to just install a cylinder head temp system 
instead?  What value do oil temp readings give you over cylinder head temp 
readings?  Do you use these readings in conjunction with oil pressure 
readings?

Thanks

Marc
