Or, for the adventurous, you can disassemble the locks (one screw if the
handle is out) and rearrange the wafers for your key.  Only cautions are
to work on a clean smooth surface (in case a wafer or spring gets loose)
and to put a key into the lock before pulling the cylinder out.

Give a man a rekeyed lock and his locks will match for a decade.  Teach a
man to rekey locks and people will bring him beer for life!
