Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Utility

well i dont think i've broken any records in this regard either.  but
i do want to say that my bus is about the most versatile &amp; practical
vehicle for hauling various items.

now i dont have to borrow a friend's pick'em up truck everytime i
want to move something.

&amp; the best thing...some of my friends/co-workers/family just looked at me
like i was out of my mind when i said i was going to get a bus. but they
sure do like that bus alot when it hauls their crap around town for them!
