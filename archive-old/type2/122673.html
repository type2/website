Subject: Re: [T2] kicked the &quot;won't idle cold&quot; but have tiny oil leak
  I'd like to fix???

Hi Will,

It's a cheap and easy fix to try replacing the oil pressure sensor 
first. When that's the source of the leak it will run down the side of 
the case exactly as you describe. It's just behind the distributor, and 
easily accessed from above.

Happy trails,

&gt;  I'm noticing a small drip of an oil leak on the drivers side just

&gt; I'm guessing this is coming from the oil cooler or nearby.  Any likely
&gt; places I can tighten a nut to see if I can stop the drip?
