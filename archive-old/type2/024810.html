Subject: Towing and electric brakes on a '72?
Message-ID: &lt;91BD4D2712D0D11187090000F803B840026390A3_at_alfexc3.alf_dot_dec_dot_com&gt;

I was out at lunch today looking at utility trailers
for our '72 Bus.  I need one to haul the Isetta once
in awhile and just for making Home Depot runs
and stuff like that.

There is a local shop that makes trailers to order and
they do great work, but that's not the point.  The question
I have is towing weight and trailer brakes.

The trailer we're looking at weighs in around 700 lbs
and the heaviest thing we'd haul on it would be the Isetta
which is 750lbs.  That combination exceeds the 
recommended maximum towing capacity of the Bus
(1000 lbs) by about half.  We have the VW trailer hitch
on the Bus already, the one that bolts up to the bumper
mounts and hides inside the bumper.

If I go with this trailer I will get electric brakes put on it, but
what type of activator do I need to get for the Bus?  Will a 
generic unit work?  Does anyone have this type of setup on
their Bus already?

Am I looking for trouble hauling 1500 lbs behind the Bus?
Will having brakes on the trailer make this setup okay?

Thanks,
Dave Burden
