Subject: Re: [T2] Snow Bus

Send all pics of your buses in the snow. They are for the front page of my
website to celebrate the winter until around February.

Deep in the snow or just covered is fine. I will also link to your site if
you have one!

Thanks for the ones that have already come in!! To see them all go here:

Sorry if this is too Friday, but the snow pics from Rex inspired me!

&gt; HOW deep you want the snow???  I have a shot of mine just after the big
&gt; blizzard a few year back.  I was stuck for 3 days until I could dig the
&gt; bus out, once the bus was out it went when the 4X4 were in the ditch

&gt; &gt; Does anybody else have pics of their bus in the snow? I'd like to put a
