Subject: Brake Question

Here's my question. I have a 71 bus that I finally started driving after =
several years of it being a garage queen. (Got my first bug guts on the =
windshield.) I went through the entire brake system a few years ago and =
replaced the flex lines, had the calipers rebuilt, new wheel cyclinders =
on the rear, adjusted and bled everything down. When I was in the belly =
pan, I noticed that the PO had put in a spring and attached it to the =
brake pedal to act as a return spring. Since it didn't look &quot;stock&quot;, I =
removed it assuming that if the braking system was properly serviced, it =
was unnecessary. OK, prior to putting on my first 40 miles of driving =
since the restoration began, I had a friend come over and help me bleed =
the brakes again. Fluid ran clear, no bubbles. By the way, diaphram on =
the servo is good, check valve good, vacuum tubing to the servo is good. =
Now to the problem. Nine times out of ten, the brakes feel great. I =
push, it's firm, the bus stops, the pedal returns, life is good. But =
every once in a while, I push, it's a little soft, the pedal doesn't =
return all the way, I push again, and it gets a little softer and closer =
to the floor. Hook my foot under the pedal, lift it back up, life's good =
again for some time to come. Anyone else have this problem? Could it be =
the master cylinder? You guys have tons more VW brake experience than I =
do so I figured I'd get a list concensus. Could it be the spring? I =
noticed that Bus Depot has brake pedal return springs listed but I don't =
remember seeing one shown in the Bently pictures. (Haven't looked at the =
Bentley in a few years though either.) I figured if it was the spring, =
it would stay down all the time. Anyway, any suggestions or similar =
experiences would be appreciated. I really want to start driving it and =
get some use out of my insurance. Besides.....it looks so DAMN GOOD, it =
needs to be seen!!!
