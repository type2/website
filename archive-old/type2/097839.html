Subject: 74 vs. 75

I keep running into 'issues' concerning my bus when I try to order parts.
My bus is a '74 with a 1.8l engine. The exhaust is the type that are
normally seen on 75-79: elbows come lower and require tin with the big
groove and the muffler connects with single ports instead of dual. Does
this mean I really need to order parts for a '75? Or do I need to just
make sure everyone concerned knows it's '74 with a 1.8l?

Also, it has a webber prog carb. Did the '74 1.8l come standard with dual
carbs or FI? My right-side head has the ports for the EGR (I assume that's
what they are) - which have come unplugged and I still haven't managed to
plug them correctly.

-Eric
