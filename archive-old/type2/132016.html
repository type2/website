Subject: Re: [T2] Painting wheels with POR

I think Terry K has the right idea, marine paint has to be ideal for wheel
rims, provided you clean and prime properly.

Powder coating is over rated IMO, I had my wheels blasted and coated and the
rust showed through within a year.  Maybe the guy doing it cut corners, I
don't know.
