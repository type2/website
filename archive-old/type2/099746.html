  hoses?

&gt;Four Questions:
&gt;
&gt;1)  There is a single outlet (inlet?) at the back of the &quot;Emission 2
&gt;Way Valve&quot; mention directly above.  To what should that be connected?

I don't remember the answer to that one.  I removed my smog equipment over ten years ago.

&gt;1b) Can this &quot;Emission 2 Way Valve&quot; be completely removed and the both
&gt;&quot;EGR Valves On Manifolds&quot; be plugged?

Yes, I blocked off the egr ports on the manifolds when I did this.  Believe it or not, I made the blockoff plates out of scraps of wood (I was living in an apartment at the time) and, with a homemade gasket underneath they lasted until I removed the carbs (about 8 years).

&gt;2)  There is a single outlet (inlet?) atop the Thermostatic valve
&gt;(which is afixed to the right side of air box).  To what should that be
&gt;connected?

Someone correct me if I'm wrong but I think that goes to one of the outlets listed below in #3.

&gt;3)  There are two outlets (inlets?) on the underside of the airbox arm
&gt;that feeds the right carb.  One is brass, the other is plastic... what
&gt;should be connected to these two outlets/inlets?

I think one goes to #2 above and the other goes to a vacuum source.  Which vacuum source I couldn't tell you but it ought to be in a book somewhere.

&gt;4)  Underneath the vehicle, above the rear left axle, there is a Y
&gt;fitting spliced into the line leading to my brake servo.  Attached to
&gt;that &quot;Y&quot; is a 3.5 mm ID hose left hanging loose and plugged.

Sounds like a non-stock item.  I've never seen such a thing on a bus.
