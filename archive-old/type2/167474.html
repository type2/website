Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for fuel injection help (L-Jet)

&gt; So Im back at it again, trying to get my stock fuel injection working again on
&gt; my 78 Bus..
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; This is what I know.. (almost certainly)
&gt;
&gt; 1. I have fuel pressure (35+ lbs)
&gt; 2. I have spark (it will start when I give it starter fluid)
&gt; 3. Injectors just got rebuilt by Cruzin Performance
&gt; 4. Engine is good, Ive been running a carb until the swap.
&gt; 5. Timing should be good as well (as above, Ive been running her)
&gt;
&gt; She will start if I spray fluid in there, but then dies..

this is a big key fact, the system itself works but it isn't getting fuel

&gt; I DO get the flickering light when I use a test light on the #1 pin on the ECU
&gt; plug from the coil.
&gt;
&gt; I DO NOT get a flicker when I test at the injector end of the harness.
&gt; The injectors have juice all the time when the key is on.

if I am not mistaken they are normally on and trigger off to open??? would
have to look that up. but flicker should happen

&gt; So why will the injectors not fire????

. resistor pack bad?

&gt; Theories:
&gt;
&gt; 1. Grounded out injector (will that cause it?)


&gt; 2. Bad ECU (tried another one or two in there)

highly unlikely

&gt; 3. Bad AFM (also tried a couple of them.)

have you turned on the ignition (engine off) and pushed a pencil or
somesuch in there and moved the air vane and listen for the fuel pump to
come on??

&gt; 4. Bad wiring harness (just put another one on there)

not likely

&gt; Im very confused, all the components check out when doing the ohm tests, and I
&gt; get the flicker ant the ECU when starting, the grounds test good at the ECU,
&gt; but I dont get flicker at the injectors.
&gt; I have also hooked up another injector to the test port and ran the harness
&gt; injector plug to it and get no spray.

so you know that the injector itself is not functioning.

why??

&gt; AARRRRGHHH
&gt;
&gt; Questions:
&gt;
&gt; 1. Will 1 grounded out injector cause all of them not to fire?
&gt; 2. What else will cause the injectors not to fire?

not getting the trigger signal is the major reason, you know that the plug
is not triggering the injector, so I would look there

good luck
Bob
