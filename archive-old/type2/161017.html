Subject: Re: [T2] Type-1 problem with zamboni engine and propane

Hi Matt,

I would check the points. If they have closed up you might not be  
getting enough dwell to build a decent spark at speeds higher than  
idle. The fact that it won't run without #3 supports this, since IIRC  
the type1 dizzy retards #3, giving it a longer dwell by default.

If the ignition system checks out OK, I would start looking for a  
propane specialist top check out the fuel system.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; folks, gotta friend with a bad zamboni.
&gt; Kaput. it will run with any one plug wire removed,
&gt; othre than #3. when #3 is out, it dies. This is
&gt; propane, otherwise i would suggest it was a fuel
&gt; filter (filters on propane??) I know nothing about
&gt; propane engines. He maintains it has a full tank of
&gt; fuel.
