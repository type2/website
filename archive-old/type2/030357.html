OK, the situation was that the poor bus died suddenly at a light, and the
Dwell/tach was showing a dwell angle of ~80 degrees, adjusting the points
didn't help.

Further background, that will be explained later:  This bus is turning
into a Frankenstein.  The body is a '73, the FI gear is '78, and the
block is '80 (V'gon) except for heads.  John put it together and
installed it last weekend.  In addition there are the usual round of
&quot;field repairs&quot; including one critical one two years ago in Washingtom
State.

Last night, Sean Bartnik and I went out, tried to set dwell, couldn't get
any better reading than that 80 degrees and could not get the bus to run.
figured the points were trashed, so we put in different points with no net
result :-( At that point, we suspected the coil, had no spare on
hand, so we called it a night.

This morning, Sean and I went out and got my spare distributor, a new coil
(alas, all they had were the blue, so I hadda blow the extra $10 and now I
have one :-( new points and a new condensor.  Installed all in the bus,
set the dwell with a feeler guage, hooked up the dwell/tach and got a
variable, very low, reading, but even that soon dropped to zero.  At that
point, I hooked up the VOM instead, just to see if the points were opening
and closing *at all*.  VOM said they were and indeed on cranking, produecd
a 6.8V reading.  So I moved the + lead on the dwell tach to the bottom of
the coil.  NO READING!!!  The (&amp;*&amp;(^ dwell tach was what had been wrong
all the time!!!! At that point we did a little calculation: 6.8/12 = x/90
or 6.8 * 90 /12 = 51.  The dwell was right on!!! (or very close)  Did the
static timing thing to be sure we were close, and we were.  pulled a spark
plug wire, propped it near a ground and saw a nice healthy blue spark.  
OK, we got spark, at the right time, so what else can it be??

Now, understand that in my experience *IT'S NEVER THE DOUBLE RELAY*!  I
look most everwhere else first.  Tested the resistor pack, it was fine.  
Sean wanted to see if the pump was OK, so he did his famous &quot;pop the top
off the AFM&quot; test (don't let Sean around your AFM, he has this thing about
looking inside the damn things :-).  Moving the flap with the ignition on
turned the fuel pump on, so it seemed that that was OK.  All FI plug-ins
were checked and the grounds were checked. All were fine.

OK, so it's double relay time. :-( Well, we started to run the Bentley
proc on double relay testing, and when we got to the part where you test
(I forget - 86c?), the damn van starts!  and runs!  'til I remove the
probe, then it dies.  WOOHOO!!!  pull that plug and see if the pin is
loose on the relay (it isn't) or if the wire is loose in the plug (it
isn't either BUT...)  Then I have this massive rush of brains to the head
(the technical name of this phenomenon is a &quot;klong&quot;) and remembered....  

Two years ago, travelling cross country, I had visited Clara (of Barndoor
fame) and shortly after leaving her place had experienced a similar
failure, because the wire from the double relay to the fuel pump had
shorted against the firewall.  Turned that wire (the blue/red one) into
charred toast.  I had replaced the wire (and we won't *even* get into the
diagnostic on that one) and have driven happily ever since.  Problem is
the repacement female spade connector does *not* have the retaining tang
that the original VW connector had, so when you take the double relay plug
off and push it on, that connector tends to ride up out of the plug!!!  
John was, of course completely unaware of this, so pushing and pulling
during engine installation was SOP for him.  It must have caught just
enough to last the 50 miles I drove before it fell off :-)  Pushed that
back on, car started and off I went.

Lessons:

Test equipment is *not* infallible!!!

If your dwell meter is busted, a VOM reading of 6.7 volts ~= 50 degrees
dwell. (note that this is *very* variable, but 6.7 should get the car
started)

Records of past repairs are really nice to have :-)

Correct diagnosis is 90% of the battle!
