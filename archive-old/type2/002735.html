I must say how happy I am to report my Type-4 powered Bus no longer uses a
drop of oil, not since I started using that High-Mileage Valvoline
synthetic.  Wow, good sh----stuff!

Has anyone used the K&amp;N oil filter on your Type-4??? I used the Porsche ref
to find it, looks correct to me!  I've been having the dry-start problem
like the Library article mentioned.  The K&amp;N claims to help that, so I'll
soon find out!!!
Mann/Mahle filters are impossible to find here and the VW dealership never
has them.

Does anybody have a Gene Berg shifter in their bus?  If so, how do you like
it?
And to all of you purists, I respectfully wish to mildly fix up my daily
driver bubble-window.

I noticed my sliding door does not have a catch the handle on the front end
of the dorm is this normal for a westy?

Last but certainly not least,
Does anyone know whether the California busses in '72 had red over red over
white or the amber-over-red-over-white?????

thanks guy,
Wade
