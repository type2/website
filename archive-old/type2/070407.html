Hi Andy, you said:

&gt;They're just a small blue and a small red lense near the heater/vent control
&gt;levers with a light behind them so you can find them in the dark. Look in a '73
&gt;or '74. Sometimes these complete instrument clusters can be had at swaps for
&gt;about $25, sometimes with clocks for $45-50.

Thanks for the info! News is always welcome :)

I'm pretty sure we (here in Europe) didn't have these, if we do have 'em they are
prety rare, as i've seen quite a few Busses but i never saw these lights.

Thanks,

Brian.
