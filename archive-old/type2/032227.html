To the owner of the too hot running engine:

maybe the oil cooler is partially plugged up, causing too much oil to use
the bypass valve, and thus not enough is getting cooled.  Does anyone know
if it is possible to get these coolers checked to determine the resistance
vs. spec?  the Bentley says something about it (or maybe Haynes), but many
services they refer to are no longer commonly available.  A related
possibility would be the bypass valve for the oil cooler being stuck open.

Hope this helps.
