Subject: Re: [T2] re: VW Trends - Compilation

Jim, that was a great writeup. And thanks for touching on something
that I had to deal with back in the early-mid 90's with my websites.

In some states just the fact that you own a business can be a tax
liability. California is an example. I had to pay an extra few hundred
a month as a small business tax. Grrr. (And Ahnold is running around
Vegas with a semi trying to draw businesses to California. LoL!)

I would expect Everrett is dealing with these issues already since
he's selling shirts and such through his site. Even if he just breaks
even he'll be reporting and possibly paying taxes on that money. :-(

If VWT can get repro rights, AND are willing, I think a compendium of
all past articles would make for a great website AND book or CD. The
site could have a few teaser articles available online, while the CD
or book would have the complete history. Including ads! I can imagine
looking at decades old ads for parts and laugh (or cry) when seeing
what was offered and at what price.

A CD would be my personal favorite, but I think many list members
would prefer a book. Maybe offer both the CD at a reasonable price AND
a &quot;collectors edition&quot; nice leatherbound book for a premium price ($99
comes to mind).
