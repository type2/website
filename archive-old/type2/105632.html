&gt; never use syns to break in a motor OR a tranny is the advice i have

&gt; far too slippery to allow proper wear-in, esp to the tranny.

In an engine, I can understand this, as the rings have to get worn-in to
exactly match the cylinders to prevent blow-by, but I really don't see
anything in the transmission that needs to be worn in in this fashion.
You do need to do an initial oil change to remove debris, but I think that
if you have the $$$ you could go synthetic from the start in a tranny.
