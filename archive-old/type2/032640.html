Subject: 72 bus hub removing

I need to pull the drums off of the '72 panel van I have. I can not get them 
to move and I cant get the stars to turn. This thing sat since 1977, so they 
are well rusted im afraid. Has anyone used a puller on these? I cant find 
anything that big at the parts houses, so I might try the local rentall 
stores to see what they have. I think it needs to spread out to around 10 
1/2&quot; and be able to grab the drum. Worse comes to worse, I suppose I will 
have to see if I can have something made.

Thanks,
David
