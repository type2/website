I certainly do not disagree with you but for a quick fix and to get John's VW to
pass inspection, this may be a good idea.  Or at least give him another place to
look for problems.  Of course, in the long run, you'd want to replace the cable
as well as it's guide tube.  If the cable is rusted or gunked up, it stands to
reason that the inside of that tube is as well.  And I have no idea what it takes
to replace the tube.
Good luck,

&gt; Maybe that works for most people, but for those of us lucky enough to live in
&gt; the rust belt, the real answer is to put on NEW e-brake cables. Couldn't be
&gt; more than about $20 each, I'd guess.

&gt; &gt; Turns out the cable was completely frozen
&gt; &gt; inside its guide tube.  There are two cables, one for each rear wheel,
&gt; &gt; that run from the rear brakes, through a metal tube, and meet up front
&gt; &gt; under the cab.  I disconnected the right cable at both ends, shot
&gt; &gt; lubricant down the tube, and muscled it loose.  It works fine for now.
&gt; &gt; Hope this helps.
