Subject: 110 V -&gt; 12 V, 2 amp = Battery Charger?? 

Comments please.

Local music store is going out of business and is selling a 110 Volt to 12 
Volt 2 amp converter for $3!!   I bought two.

Can this be used as an overnight charger??  I mean, 2 amps is pretty 
significant, and I measured the output at 15.5 volts DC, more than the rated 
12 volts.

This beast weighs 1.5 kg so it is not economical to mail.   Anyone local who 
would like me to pick one up and hold it, the store closes Saturday, and 
things are going ...  Last night there was a dozen or so left....   Marcus, 
Tom, Andy, Steven (you always need another one), Jeff, 'Joe'.....

Comments on over charging, permanent installation, automatic shut offs, etc.

And this comes right after I bought the Sears Craftsman 50/10/2 amp battery 
charger!!
