Subject: Re: What are &quot;Deadhead stickers&quot;?

&gt;scale indicator to how much a VW bus is trashed. The more of these &quot;Deadhead&quot;
&gt;stickers on a bus, the worse the condition of the bus, and the nearer the
&gt;bus is
&gt;to it's death, hence the name &quot;Deadhead&quot; sticker.  On buses that have their
&gt;windows totally covered with &quot;Deadhead&quot; stickers, those are usually are not far
&gt;from being junked.

        Seems to be a problem here. I've got a sh*tload of dead stickers on
my bus-just ask the Inuvikkers. And my bus does have the apperence of a
beater in the nonessentials. Believe it or not, it's actually in remarkably
better condition than the day I rescued it. I say rescued because I bought
it for $150 from an impound yard in LA-with nary a dead sticker in sight.
Prior to my purchase the dreaded PO's put bondo on every surface they could
find, blew up the engine (rod through #3), put in a Taiwanesse light switch
(which was rapidly melting!!), and a General Motors ignition. Oh, and the
side veiw mirrors off a Chevy passenger car. Put on with sheet metal
screws. Couldn't even open the vent wings. All of this they did with only a
lonely KROQ radio sticker.

        I have slowly but surely removed some of the evidence of thier
sins, and put on many a Deadhead sticker in the process. She still looks
ugly, with all that bondo, but she runs like a champ. 12,000 miles last
summer, with the lone mechanical failure being a shock bolt and brake
cynlinder-due to 200+ miles of bumpy dirt road. About 60,000 since I
rescued her, and all the engine and drive parts have been replaced and
repaired. We've grown together, and we trust each other. If I want to up
and go to California tomorrow, I'll give her a tune up, change her oil, get
a good nights sleep, and go. And she'll get me there with a minimum of
fuss. She's a good old girl, even with all the Dead stickers. With any luck
our financial fortunes will change for the better and I'll be able to give
her the face lift she deserves after all these years. And maybe just one
more Steal Your Face for the road.

Peace,
