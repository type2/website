&gt; Ouch. Sounds like I need something fairly pricey. Maybe I'll just buy a new
&gt; body and transfer my engine/tranny instead. I've found a few in pretty good
&gt; shape for under $500, but then I got thinking that I could probably get the
&gt; tools to fix up mine for less, but it's looking like it might not only cost
&gt; just as much if not more, not to mention being a LOT harder.

figure about $500 will have you welding no matter what you buy, throw in
an extra $150 or so if you want an auto darkening helmet (worth every
penny and then some)

even if you bought a brand new body there would still be a fair amount of
work involved...

in the FWIW file, I have a Lincoln 100 with MIG conversion,. mainly
because I don't have 220 where I have to work, in fact I use a generator
for my welder...one thing I will give the Lincoln, I have gone way over
the duty cycle on a few occasions and it doesn't even get warm and has
never cut out.
