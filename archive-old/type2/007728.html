&gt; I thought in Brazil they run almost all gas engines with a alcohol

&gt; Given the experimentation with electric / propane / -- is there any

Besides the
&gt; political benefits of staying out of middle east wars, is there any
&gt; environmental benefit?
&gt; 
&gt; I presume that are beloved Type1 engine is run in Brazil with
alcohol --
&gt; I've heard reference to this, but not seen a good discussion on it.
&gt; 
&gt; Any technical information on the differences?  It is just normal
carbs with
&gt; some mods, or a completely different carb setup?

Alcohol requires a different mixture than gasoline, so the carburator
has to be set much richer.  In addition, the heat value of alcohol is
less, so your gas tank has to be about half again as big to get the
same range.  Alcohol isn't compatible with many of the materials in
gasoline fuel systems, so the system has to be redesigned with
alcohol-resistant materials.

On the plus side, alcohol's resistance to knock (octane rating) is
higher than gasoline's, so you can run higher compression without
risking detonation.

The economies of producting alcohol are somewhat dubious.  It takes a
lot of effort to grow the grain needed to produce alcohol.  If we all
decided to run alcohol next week there isn't be enough acreage to grow
the grain needed.  It also requires a lot of fuel to grow grain, to
run tractors, pump water, harvest the crop etc.

In Brazil there was a surplus of sugar cane production, which lent
itself to the production of alcohol.  The price of alcohol was
artifically low, due to government subsidies.  Still, I'm not sure
that alcohol fuels were that much of a success in Brasil.
