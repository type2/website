Subject: Re: [T2] frame welding

Not to scare you or anything but I had the same problem on my 79. I had
plans to weld it but didn't get to it in time and one day I was on my way to
work and rear torsion tube separated from the frame, couldn't shift or
anything. Impossible to fix after that so off to bone yard it went. FIX IT
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

Joey.


&gt; List-
&gt;  I have some rust holes on the frame of my 72 Westy. The worst spot is
&gt; around the rear torsion tube where it attaches to the frame
