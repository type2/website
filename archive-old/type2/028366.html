Mike, if whoever adjusted your clutch last left the toothed adjuster nut on
a high point instead of a low point, (take a look, you will see) then it
will sooner or later drop into place and do exactly what you described.
Adjust and see.

&gt; &gt;so I turned the bus off and it shifts into all the gears just fine.
&gt; &gt;I started it with the clutch in and in first and it wanted to die,
&gt; &gt;but it didn't move forward. Then when I was on my way back home it
&gt; &gt;was nearly impossible to shift into second and third gear.
