&gt; I have a quick question. My 72 bus needs a valve adjustment and the timing
&gt; corrected. My local VW guy quoted me $250 for a tune-up and complete
&gt; check-up. Does this seem reasonable? I have not dealt much with the mechanic
&gt; scene because I usually do the work myself. So, I really don9t have much to
&gt; compare it to except you guys.

$250 sounds awefull high unless he is doing a lot of high end tests that
the VW really doesn't need just to get running stock....I would take the
$250 get the Bentley (if you don't have iit) and some tools like a timing
light and do it yourself and have a large pizza and 6 pack on the left
over money
