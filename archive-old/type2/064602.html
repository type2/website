Subject: $400 camper at the top of Tioga Pass

&gt;And near the Tioga entrance to Yosemite, there was a '68 or '69 camper for
&gt;sell for $400.  My wife just said, &quot;Keep on driving&quot;...  :(  (insert puppy
&gt;whining noises here)....

I saw that one, and I bet all the other Bay Area CCC's saw it
too.  No one bought it???  If it's still there when I go to
Yosemite this coming weekend, I'll check it out and probably
bring it back.

Driving from Whitehorse to Skagway on the Inuvik trip, I saw a
similar bus that I assume didn't make it over White (aka &quot;Dead
Horse&quot;) Pass, but there was only one of me driving, and I wasn't
about to pay another $800 to get a semi-junker bus home on the
ferry.  Now I think of it as &quot;Dead Bus Pass.&quot;
