Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [vanagon] R-12 alternative Update

Wow, I didn't realize how much &quot;fire and brimstone&quot; this subject would have.
I think I was the one who posted information about Auto Frost.  I have a 25
pound bottle of it which has a big &quot;non flamable&quot; sticker on the side.  I
have put it in my '85 Jetta and will also use it in my 3/4 ton truck when it
needs it.  I am planning on installing a turbo diesel engine and AC system
in a splitty bus this winter and wanted an inexpensive alternative to R12.

I really was just giving a laymen's opinion on Auto Frost, it seems to work
well for me and I liked the tests that showed the oil remained suspended
better than in other &quot;compound refridgerants&quot;.

Hey, at $6 a pound it sure beats the $45 a pound for R12 and it works for
me, at least as good as R12, maybe even a bit better.
