Subject: Dead coil?  Weird coincidence!

&quot;this lucky moment?  (Weird coincidence #2?)

Any other way I could check my coil, on the chance that my technique with
the Muir coil-spark-check was poor?&quot;


Easiest way to check ignition system is with a simple test light. First
check + side like you did. Then have someone crank the engine over while
you put your testlight on the - side. If points are working the test light
will blink. No blinks no spark. Hands still clean go to Flaps replace
points... Of course your coil could go bad as well but its not very often.
Your points are what fire your coil so if you have blinks and no spark then
it is your coil.
