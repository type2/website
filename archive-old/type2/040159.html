Subject: New events page

Hi everyone!  The events page that was previously hosted by Page and Peggy
at http://members.aol_dot_com/OurVWs/events.html has been relocated.  You can
now find it at http://members.aol_dot_com/VWShows.  I just put it up this
morning with very little modification.  Over the next few days, I will be
updating it, but please send me your shows and I'll have them up within 48
hours!

Paul
