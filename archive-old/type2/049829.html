Subject: [T2] 1975 Westfalia color info needed.

You may recall that Hoop forwarded a message about 2 free buses in Virginia. The buses were retrieved about two weeks ago and are resting peacefully at the warehouse. The 1975 Westy will make a comeback. It is slated for some Metwiz work, paint, and a replacement interior that was pulled from another 1975 found out in the country.

The bus will be resprayed the original color which is that yellowy greenish color but we are having a time figuring out what the color is.

 It appears that 1975 Westys came in three colors :white, yellow and orange. A trip through the archives indicates that the only color the yellow could be is the Yosemite Yellow L62H.

I then visited the Type2 Library and linked to Vincent's site to confirm the M-code tag info. The paint and interior code from this 1975 Westy is 964849 which according to vincent matrix translates into -

9648 L65K ravennagrün/ravenna green for the paint and
49 camping red for the interior.

To confuse matters the matrix has L62H listed as bali yellow B1B1 which differs from the archive info. Not to mention the bus has green doorpanels and the typical green vinyl seats with the blue green plaid not red.

Do any other 1975 westy owners have the same m tag # for paint and interior? Do you have pics of the bus? Can anyone clarify the info above? 

One other trivial point. The export code on the bus is TE. I cannot find a reference for that code. All us desitnations seem to start with U and the old tourist delivery code was UT. The only T code I could find was Thailand.
