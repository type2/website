Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Vanagon Seat Armrest Removal

&gt; I have a couple questions for you:
&gt; What year Vanagon did you take those grey seats out of?  (And, as a
&gt; corollary, what year were the less comfortable brown seats?)

Late 80's. Don't know the year, I didn't check the VIN on the donor
Vanagon at the pull'n'save.

&gt; How much higher, if any, do the vanagon seats sit than the stock
&gt; seats?  I'm pretty tall and I'm not sure if I could handle being much
&gt; closer to the roof than the stock seats (in good condition) put me.

I'm 5'11&quot; mostly torso and fit with several inches of headroom. It
adds just an inch or two above stock.
&gt;
&gt; I hope you figure out how to cover up the gash in the seat where the
&gt; armrest used to be.  Perhaps a unique sewed on patch.

I'm going to make a removable plate to cover it. That way if I ever
need to put them in a Vanagon (or if I take the fresh air ducts off
the doors) I can reinstall the arms.

&gt;
&gt; That brings me to the last question does the Vanagon armrest sit at
&gt; the same level as your vent armrest that's on the door panel?

Yep. That's why I needed to remove the arms. It looks like without the
ducting they might fit with the armrests.

&gt;
&gt; Thanks a bunch.  Nice write up, by the way.

Thanks. There was info around but nothing with pictures. I just wanted
to get something out there for the visually oriented among us. =D
