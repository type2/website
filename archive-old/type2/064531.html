Subject: fuel injection pressurization

Here's a sort of definitive answer to the question &quot;Does the fuel in my
VW fi system stay pressurized when the engine's off?&quot;

The Bosch book I have says yes.

&quot;High-pressure fuel is delivered through a check valve, which closes
when the fuel pump stops to hold pressure in the lines.
Constantly-pressured fuel lines ensure quicker restarts, and also help
prevent vapor lock.&quot;

This is, of course, why on newer cars there is a little warning label on
the gas cap that says to open the cap slowly as the fuel system is under
pressure.  Now, on my '78 bus, I've never heard the hiss that you get
with a pressurized system but I assume that the fuel lines are
constantly pressurized or else it would take forever to start and you'd
get vapor lock in the hot weather.
