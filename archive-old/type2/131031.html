Subject: Motor going in

Well after mucho thinking and coming to some agreements
I am putting the 1700 914 fi motor into my van.  I will be
heading down to the shop today and helping to get all
the parts in it today.  The 2 liter coming out will be rebuilt
and put in at some later date. (needs rings). I remember the
1700 getting some amazing fuel mileage and good good power.
Feels like more than im getting now out of the 2 liter but thats
most likely cause its needing work.

Had it touring around yesterday (2 liter is still in it) and my bud
and I were testing the mojo of the van. On a whim we asked
these girls to model for us.  Chicks dig vans.

There are also some pictures there from a swapmeet in Edmonton
a couple months ago.

not to mention this lady killer :

Back to van content, I am putting the 78 bus exhaust system
on my 74 Westie in the rebuild process.
