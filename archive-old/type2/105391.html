Subject: RE: Defeat

Mike has it right, based on my experience building model airplanes.  There
have been occasions where I needed to &quot;undo&quot; a joint made with CA/superglue.
What worked for me was to keep it wet with acetone for a long time, like,
hours, in some cases.  This is easier said than done, as acetone evaporates
quite rapidly.  But, in the end, it worked every time.  My technique usally
involoves wrapping the joint in plastic to slow the evaporation of the
acetone.  So, I would suggest that you not give up just yet.  Use one of the
acetone bearing products you have, apply liberally, cover with plastic and
be patient.  This stuff WILL dissolve, but it takes time.
