&gt;Rubbing compound comes in different grades of abrasiveness. To buff your
&gt;paint job, use the least abrasive kind: you don't want to remove more than
&gt;you have to.

Often, the least abrasive grade of rubbing compound is called
&quot;polishing compound&quot; instead of rubbing compound.  More abrasive
grades will actually strip the paint, polishing compound is just
supposed to take the oxidized paint off the top of the (supposedly)
good paint underneath.  Wash the area first, use the polishing
compound to get rid of the oxidized paint, then wax immediately to
cover the fresh paint so it doesn't oxidize right away.  Or something
like that :-)--maybe its all just a scheme to entice the hapless
consumer into wasting bucks on paste and wax.
