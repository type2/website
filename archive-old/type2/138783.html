Subject: Re: [T2] cht wiring

Yours is similar to what I was thinking about doing. Why do you recommend
such a large hole and grommet? I have some 1/2&quot; gromets that have a hole in
the middle that are just right to fit the cable snug.

&gt; Ideally, your grommet will be about 1&quot; in diameter.
