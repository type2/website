&gt; Why put good heavy duty tires on weak rims, right?
&gt; 
&gt; Just wondering, I picked up a set of fake Porsche alloys, considering
&gt; putting good tires n them and running them on one of the buses,
however,
&gt; are the rims weak crap?  Can they bear a frequently heavily loaded
bus.  My
&gt; high speed mountain driving would hurt them would it?

Any aftermarket rim is suspect, even for normal-duty operations.  

Back when I was involved in off-roading, the advice for the narrower
front wheels was to either run a big-bucks real racing wheel
(Centerline, for example) or the stock rim.  Aftermarket wheels,
particularly the cast ones, had a habit of breaking into chunks when
subjected to impact.  Welded ones were better, but the quality of
welding varies wildly and failures were fairly common.  VW wheels
would bend, you'd hammer them back to semi-roundness and keep on racing.

I'd say that the cheaper &quot;porsche style&quot; alloys were designed to hold
up a standard automobile, not a truck-weight bus.  Throw in a rock or
a pothole and those cast wheels could easily fail.  The problem isn't
supporting the 1500-pound normal load, it's taking an impact load that
is 10 times as much.

When in doubt, talk to the manufacturer.  They should know the load
rating of their wheels.
