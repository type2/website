Subject: VW Trends - Compilation

Hey guys,

    I just got through reading about VW Trends on here.... it's a real shame,
I was actually JUST considering subscribing to it with some of the money that
I was going to get back from my tax return.

What I'm curious about is... are they planning on releasing a compilation?
Perhaps a book or on CD?
What I mean is, something that basically includes every article they've ever
written and combine them in one source.

Sort of like what COMPUTE! magazine did when they went under, and what
National Geographic does every 5 years?


Thanks,

Todd
