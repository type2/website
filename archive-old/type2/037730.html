&gt; Subject: Identifying an engine
&gt; 
&gt; Hey folks,
&gt; 
&gt; I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions on how to
&gt; identify an engine.
&gt; I *know* the rebuilt engine in my '76 westy isn't from a
&gt; '76 (possibly not
&gt; even a type2) and I'd like to find out exactly what it
&gt; is. Any ideas ?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Michael
&gt; 
I am sure that Myself or many others on this list could
tell you what motor you have, you need to tell us the
number on the case. If the engine is a type 4 style the
number will be on the top behind the fan shroud, if it is
an upright(hope its not)it will be under the Gen/Alt stand.
If you have the Idiot manual(Muir) it will help you find
the number and will also tell you what it came out of. You
may want to get both the idiot manual and the Bently
Manual. Both books have very good info. The Bently is
written for the professional in mind, and the Idiot manual
is just that, written on a 3rd grade level, good to
introduce you to the wonderfull world of VW's. Don't hold
the info in Muir's book as gosple, check it against the
Bently or even get a Hanes or Chiltons, these are O.K. but
the Bently is better.
  I only tell you this because it sounds like you have no
manuals. I have all but the Chiltons and will not part with
any, I check all three while working, its like having 3
good mechanics there to help you along the way, not every
one knows everything, but with 3 you should be able to come
up with something.
Good luck and let us know if we can help.
