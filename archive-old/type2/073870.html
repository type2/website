If the heads were put back on reversed,
the sender will be on the other side.
There should still be a sender hole in the sheet metal.
If the sender turns out to be on the opposite side,
you can just extend the wire. Try grounding the sender wire
and see if the engine now runs, but very rich .
The oil leak under # 3 may just be fuel from repeated
ayyempts to start the engine. Check the oil level.

&gt;From what I have now heard, I started to look for the
&gt;cly head temp #3 (Temp sensor 2 I assume), but I could
&gt;not find it where the manual states....between the
&gt;intake flange and the spark plug hole of cylinder #3.
&gt;I did however find the wire that I assume should
&gt;connect to it.  I can't for the life of my figure out
&gt;where to hook it up.  The only thing I see that could
&gt;be this sensor is just on the firewall side of the
&gt;distributor, and it is already hooked up (could be
&gt;wrong)
&gt;
&gt;Off on a limb, the PO said that he had a cylinder head
&gt;rebuilt, and when looking throught the #3 spark plug
&gt;hole, I see a very clean cylinder head so I assume
&gt;that's the one.  My question is, when the work was
&gt;done, could they have put different engine tin in and
&gt;forgotten to hook up the sensor?  Just grabbing at
&gt;straws.
