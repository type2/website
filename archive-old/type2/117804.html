Subject: RE: Who did my conversion

That looks like a safare custom camper.  I have one.  You have the same 
layout 
and the trim and mose of the accessories match, bucket, mirror, fridge, 
stove table, cabinets, rear seat and table, top, top windowsB.  I know of 
at least one other.  My is a 73.  There are some differences, you don't 
have a upper bed..
 
There should be a plate by the passenger door.  Though, it may have been 
removed when the bus was re-painted.

&gt; &gt; Hi Folks,
&gt; &gt; Has anyone heard of a company called &quot;Spirit?&quot; I'm asking as I 
&gt; &gt; purchased a 1977 VW Camper High Roof that had this company do the 
&gt; &gt; conversion &amp; I wanted to learn more about them! There is a single spot 
&gt; &gt; that identifies this as a Spirit conversion. It is on the cabinet 
&gt; &gt; behind the driver's head. It is nothing more than a little square piece 
&gt; &gt; of paper identifying the conversion. it is taped down on the cabinet 
&gt; &gt; using a spot of wide, clear tape.
