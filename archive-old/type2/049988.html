Subject: Swampy coolers

I know it is winter and I know that I just posted a question regarding
heating, but I saw a post while in the archives about swampy coolers
http://www.swampy_dot_net. Has anyone used these? Are they good? Thinking of
bringing the van east this summer and even a guy who grew up in Jersey can't
bear to think of the humidity .... Any info is appreciated. Happy holidays
to all!!
