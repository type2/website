Hello,

Someone recently inquired about a redwood city are (i believe) mechanic that 
was good. remember who it was?

A friend of mines bus, a 74 westy, needs some help before she trekks out to 
Minn in a week.

the front end is loose, and I took it to get aligned.
they said they could not because of the following :

RF Adjusting sleeve is bent.
LF Tie Rod is loose.
upper/lower Ball Joints on both sides are
rusted and void of any grease.

We are not even sure if these things are going to be worth fixing.
she has put a fair amount of $$ into it already and may not want to deal
with it anymore. ill pursuade as much as I can, and buy it from her b4 she 
scraps it or anything .


any advise would rock...


Christopher
76 westfalia
