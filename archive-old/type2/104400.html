Subject: RE: [T2] Lack of Confidence in Van

I can completely relate to your dilemma.  In my youth I used to take off
on long trips in my vans whatever condition they might be in.  I never
got stranded.  In those days there was just coil, dizzy, carb, fuel pump
to fail. Easy to diagnose, easy to fix, easy to carry spares.  Though
todays vans are essentially better, there is more to go wrong and more
to worry about.  I guess this is why so many on this redo their engines
from top to bottom.
  In the old days I used to feel like rebuilt heads (with sodium filled
valves, as then recommended) was a relatively cheap and reasonable
investment in reliability.  Though I've never dropped a valve in
thirty-five years of driving vans.  I don't know if it helps but I tend
not to drive my vans to the limit. I do touch 75-80 mph occasionally in
heavy freeway driving, but I'm more comfortable in the 65-70 mph range.
Maybe I'm just a little lucky.
A few years ago I had a couple of strandings in a '80 Westy I had newly
acquired,  I had no familiarity with FI systems and all I would have had
to do is reconnect the loose wire to the heat temperature sensor.  Since
then I have been acutely aware of the need to keep everything  as tip
top as possible, know how to make field repairs, and carry spares.  I
guess it isn't a perfect world, always compromises to make.
  My other car is a low mileage 92 BMW and I have gotten a bit spoiled
by the sense of reliability it provides; but it could be just an
illusion.
I'd love to read some other responses to this question
