Subject: Re: [T2] Funny noises in my Distributor

Sounds like something needs lube. Oil on felt under rotor takes care of the 
mech. advance. Dry rubbing block on points can cause a heck of a racket. 
Tiny dab of grease will fix it. If that don't stop it, pull the dizzy, 
remove the point plate and drive dog, then pull the shaft, clean and lube, 
reassemble.
