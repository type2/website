Hmmm It sounds like a VW 3.5 D which is a heavy duty VW &quot;LT&quot; ...should have
had dual wheels in the back...
The MB diesel and the Double logos are posers tho....
The LT Diesel use the 2.4 liter 6 cylinder VW unit with or with out turbo..the
diesel started in like 1980 or so....(The LT range started in 1974?)
Is it possible that the MB is a transplant in the chassis?..
And...How bad is the body..I've been looking for an LT for *years*..drove them
in Europe and loved 'em....and the spare engine for my wife's Volvo TD *is*
the correct engine for the beast......
Or it could be some *real* automotive freak...
