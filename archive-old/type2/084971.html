Subject: Oil dipstick tube

I've got a '97 bus with an 1800 engine in it.  I love her dearly, but the 
oil dipstick tube has nearly broken off entirely about an inch from the 
end.  Also, whether due to that problem or not, the stopper doesn't seem to 
want to stay in all the way.  The result is that oil is getting EVERWHERE 
except in the engine where I want it!  I've been looking around for a used 
oil dipstick tube, but I seem to have found every part BUT that one!  Can 
anyone help me with (a) finding a replacement tube or (b) give some 
suggestions to fixing this problem safely on my own?  Thanks.
