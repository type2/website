Subject: After market seatbelts???

Hi!

We're back! Her Majesty and I just did a little road trip from Mammoth 
to Arcata and up the coast, then over to Seattle and back! We had a 
blast. 

Now to the meat of this post - I want to buy her some after market, 
retractable seat belts... any ideas where I could find them?

Thanks for any help that any of you might be able to render!

:-)

P.S. BOY, are there a LOT of buses in Seattle!!! We got the peace sign 
no less than a million times on this trip!
