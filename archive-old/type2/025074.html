Subject: HotVWs bay bus content
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I just got my new Hot VWs Magazine.  Boy, was I ever surprised to see a 
feature on a baywindow bus!
Not only that, but there was also a how-to on putting a radio/cd 
changer/speakers in a bay Westy.
Better still, it appeard that a staffer has bought a bay Westy (probably ther 
one used for the stereo article).
I wasn't aware that these guys knew that VW made busses (or buses) after '67.
