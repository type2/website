Subject: Follow up on tach idea

Awhile back I floated the idea of installing a digital tach in the space
normally occupied bya clock on the 81 vanagon. The idea was to drill through
the face plate above the gas guage and so on. Someone recommended studying
this idea on the kitchen table for a loooong time before taking out the
drill.....he was right.

I spent the past couple of nights actually removing the clock guts from my
nonworking extra, drilling the 2 1/8&quot; hole in the clock face and through the
back, and refinishing all for a neat looking little package that would fit
right back in the instrument console. When I pulled the console out of the
van to test fit the thing, I found the detail that queers the deal: the
circuit ribbon that I sort of remembered fitting behind the clock actually
fits over and around it and it is impossible to fit it over the 3&quot; deep tach.

Oh well, back to the kitchen table.
