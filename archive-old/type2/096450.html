Subject: Re: [T2] bleeder valves

Melissa,

At least you checked the bleeders first!

Every time I have done this, it's been a &quot;no-win&quot;.

I've twisted more of them off than I can remember.

I've had some success with easy-outs(no flames please), but it's usually 
just a lot easier to get new cylinders.

My opinion is that if the bleeders won't come out correctly, then
you probably need new cylinders anyway.

I would probably avoid heat on something that close to brake fluid.

Cheers ,dave

&gt; Listees, 
&gt; 
&gt; I tried unsuccessfully yesterday to open my rear bleeder valves on my 71 
&gt; before I switched out the hoses. I squirted them down with some rust 
&gt; penetrator ahead of time let them sit a few hours and still couldn't get them 
&gt; open. I gave up trying to apply too much pressure for fear of stripping them. 
&gt; Any ideas what I could do to get these little buggers off? Would a light 
&gt; torch help? I dont want to replace the back lines just to find out I cant 
&gt; bleed them and will be screwed.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks all!
