Subject: CA smog II, scrapping info

There was some talk on the Thing list re: CA smog laws...
prompted me to go looking 'round the 'net for info.

        Below are some web sites that include facts, consumer info
and opinions re: CA's Smog Check II &amp; &quot;gross polluter&quot; scrapping
programs.  Looks like there are lots of thorny issues, and
it's anyone's guess as to how all this will work out in practice.
Read for yourself &amp; decide what you think.  Looks like CARB
has public hearings... get involved if it matters to you.

(p.s.:  I have not felt that smog &quot;pain&quot; in the bottom of my lungs
even once since leaving CA... but CA's still home &amp; I miss it.)
