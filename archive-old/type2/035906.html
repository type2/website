Hello All.  I am at my wits end.  I installed a new battery last wed.
Everything worked great for a couple of days.  Now my battery seems to
drain overnight.  I cant find the source of the problem.  Does anybody know
what i might have done to cause this.  The battery connections look great,
remounted my ground strap.  Thanks  Dan
