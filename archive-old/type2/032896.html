I agree with some of what Charlie says, though I would not
have chosen to be as pointed as he.

But i often have felt, as a vw neophyte, but not as a life neophyte, that there is
too much impatience directed at those of us at the bottom of the fairly steep
learning curve of understanding vw's.  This impatience/intolerance towards those of
us who didn't grow up working on cars and who have in our present wisdon realized
that it would be good to know how to do so, is *completely* unecessary.  I work in a
library and every day have to show people how to find books even though they
probably *should* know how to do so already, and I do it with as much kindness as
possible.

Some people know more about shoes, English, libraries, tools, teeth, clothing,
jewelry, etc.  Some know more about
cars.  We all are so ignorant about something that we could be treated poorly by
someone who knows more than us every single day of our lives if thats what the
Knowers chose to do.

Of all places, this should be a list of tolerance and patience.  
We are after all driving the slowest cars/vans on the planet.


Peace,

Dale G
