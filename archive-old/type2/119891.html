Subject: where to get idle stabilizer replacement plugs harness side

my plugs on my harness that plug into the idle
stabilizer unit are bad and don't seem to be
repairable (although that would be great) and the
dealer only sells those plugs as part of the $150
harness.  Anyone know where to get such plugs.  83
