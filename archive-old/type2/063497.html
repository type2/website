Subject: Looked at a '72 for sale

A couple of days ago I looked at a '72 Westy for sale at a nearby garage.
The sign said $1500 needs head gaskets (?!) a lot they know.  Anyway, I
went 'round back and popped the decklid to peep at the engine.  It was a
type IV alright, but it had an electric low-pressure fuel pump and dual
carburetors (converted from FI I guess) and the oil-fill thingy was
located on top of the case instead of sticking out the back on an angle.
Is this an engine from a 411/412?  I don't need a bus now (got too many
cars as it is) but if anyone's interested...ah, nevermind.
I just was curious about what this engine was.
Thanks,

I wonder what's really wrong with it, probably a dropped valve.
