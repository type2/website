The bulkhead fitting is a piece of steel fuel line passed through a chunk of
&quot;all thread&quot; (I think that's what it is called--used to thread the socket
fixtures on lamps) which is itself secured to the bulkhead by nuts, lock
washers and screws. Basically, you are passing the fuel line through the
steel, threaded cylinder instead of through a rubber grommet. You then
connect your rubber fuel line at either end of the steel fuel line, and off
you go not having to worry about vibration eating up that grommet anymore.
Works great (so far :)).



[...]Finally, what is this bulkhead fitting that The Honorable Mr. Hoover
&gt;talks about?  I have not bought a CD yet, and the sermons are well...you
know.  I saw talk of it in the archives.[...]
