hey rob,
thanks for the response. Unfortunately it was about 2 hours too late as I
had already hit the road. That sounds like exactly the type of place I was
hoping to find. Anyways my bus made it with no problems. I passed the 90,000
mile mark for the first time adding nearly 1500 miles to it in 4 days. I was
hoping to turn the odometer over by the end of the summer but I didn't get
to be on the road as much as I would have liked to.  I bought it this July
with 84,000 miles on it so I did not bad for the summer and it has run like
it just drove off the lot the whole time.

keep on bussin'

Hey Glenn,
You might want to visit Organic Bob's place in Crescent Valley -between
Nelson and Castlegar. This guy has a quite a few bay windows and bugs.
He even has a few split screens, ghias and type 4's. The name of the
actual place is Organic Mechanix. He's been there since the 60's. The
local road runs right through the middle of his yard. It's off the
beaten track but well worth the trip. I make a pilgrimage to there from
Abbotsford at least once a year.

Subject: [T2] BC Canada Wreckers?

hi all,
I am going to be traveling from Calgary, AB to Vancouver and Whistler in
my
1977 Bus. If anyone knows any good wrecking yards along the way or near
by
please let me know. The trip is completely unplanned except for seeing
Burt
Neilson Band in Whistler on Monday and Oysterhead in Vancouver Tuesday
so if
anyone in those areas is interested in a trip to the wreckers or having
a
beer on Monday or Tuesday during the day let me know.
have a great weekend,
Glenn
