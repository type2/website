Subject: Re: [T2] Window Regulator

Don't know about the '77's, but in my Vanagons you remove and install the
window regulator through the door itself, having taken off the interior
panel and pulling the glass in the window up to the &quot;closed&quot; position to
give you room.

&gt; Hello everyone,
&gt;       I owna 77 westy and the window regulator was
&gt; really rough, so I tried to take it out.  Well...it
&gt; snapped in the process at the end renduring it
&gt; useless.  I ordered a new one and now I'm having a
&gt; hard time puting it in.  It looks like the shaft in
&gt; between the window and vent window needs to be
&gt; removed, but the window glass is in the way.  Any help
&gt; would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks a lot.
