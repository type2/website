Subject: 2.0L Heads Rebuilt

Who needs them? 2.0L Heads VW part# 022-101-372G. $175 Ea. or $300 for both. 
These heads need a home and I need some parts and doodads to finish my 
engine and get &quot;el Verde&quot; on the road. It is nice to have them laying 
around, but I don't want my bus doing the same any longer. I went camping 
this weekend without a Bus :(. Had to camp out of a Saturn Wagon. Come on 
guys help me out. Pmail me any questions.

'77 Westy Deluxe AT, &quot;el Verde&quot; ....soon to be back on the road again...
