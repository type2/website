I talked to him just Tuesday evening on the phone, he is fine, but
extremely busy-- I just bought a bunch of tin and heat exchangers,
mufflers, etc. and I suspect he's just been out there getting them all
ready!  You might try getting him after dark (in CA).

&gt; some of you on the list work with or know Jim and I'd appreciate finding out
&gt; if this is just me...  If I do not hear from him soon, I fear an order has
&gt; gone very wrong.
