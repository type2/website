get yourself a propane torch.  apply heat to the gear and it should
loosen right up. I would recommend having a good pair of thick gloves
preferably for welding.  hold crank upright and give a light but firm
tap. try pulling as well.  i've used the method before and its worked
pretty well.   use heat during installation to expand gear and it should
slide right on.  putting the crank in the freezer would be effective
also.
