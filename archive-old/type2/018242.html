Subject: Compression, could this be the problem?
Message-ID: &lt;374a996fCompression, could this be the problem?*_at_m400gw.wiley_dot_com&gt;

&gt;cold compression test  #1 - 129 #2 - 128 #3 - 121 #4 - 115
 &gt;Warm compression test #1 - 119 #2 - 123 #3 - 111 #4 - 106
&gt; The engine lopes as it idles.  Though it has a mild cam (I don't know the 
type), It
&gt;doesn't have that performance cam type lope.  Idle adjustments will not 
raise the engine speed above 850-900 rpms. Can
&gt;anyone help me out.

&gt;Thanks,

Greg, 
your compression is within range. I would look elsewhere for your problem. A 
good starting place might be the non-stock
heads and cam.
