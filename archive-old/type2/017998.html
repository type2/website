&gt; I'm talking to a guy about a bus... sound familiar to anyone? It's a '76

&gt; I'm not exacly in a position to go look at it right now. The last time it
&gt; was overhauled (about 40K ago) the PO did something I'm unfamiliar with. He
&gt; removed the FI system and installed a carb (a -28 or -30, the current owner
&gt; can't remember which). I guess my question is -- is this a good thing? 

Well here is my opinion on this (everyone knows where this is going....)
I personally would NOT buy a van that had been converted from FI to carb
unless it was the nicest Westy in the universe AND the owner had every
single FI part, nut, and bolt in a box, clearly labeled for me to
re-install and was willing to take a few hundred off the price for my
trouble.

I would not hesitate to buy a van that came originally with carb(s). 
However, the simple fact that someone removed their FI to install carbs
indicates to me that the person does not know and does not care to know
how the FI works.  This indicates to me that said person may be lazy or
ignorant about other maintenance stuff and I should be wary of the
condition of this vehicle.  The FI system really isn't that complex and
a bit of reading will get you a long way with it.

All Type 4 engines that came with carbs originally, came with dual
carbs.  I don't much care for the hassle of one carb, let alone two!
:-)  However, there is one other issue that arises from this.  It
appears that the '76 you are considering has been converted to a SINGLE
carb.  This is not too good if you live somewhere where the temps get
cool.  VW never devised a setup for intake air preheating for the dual
carb Type 4 engines because none was necessary.  The dual carbs had very
short manifolds and were bolted on right above the heads, which warmed
quickly, so carb icing was not a problem.  You will note however, that
on all single carb VWs, there was originally a intake air preheating
method because the carb sits isolated on a long manifold atop the center
of the engine.  In cool humid weather, carb icing can be a real
problem.  My Ghia, for example, has a heat riser which runs from the
exhaust up to the intake manifold to warm the manifold quickly and also
a warm air intake -- an air intake which picks up heated air from the
area under the right head and delivers it into the air cleaner also to
help fight carb icing.  The '76 is unlikely to have any of this unless
the owner has rigged up something homemade, which I find unlikely.  

Hope this helps
