Subject: [T2] Body&amp;PaintPlaces

Hi, I'm located in Northern California,
specifically in Grass Valley, which is near
Sacramento.
I am going to need get together with a body and
paint shop to spiff up the type 2.  Any
references toward an outfit that will treat my car
with the dignity it deserves would be
welcome.  It is a 69 Double Cab Pickup and will
need some attention to rust as well as getting
the tail and side boards straightened out.  I
would like the people who will work on it to be
experienced with VW's.

Does anybody in the subscribership have any
opinions or references toward such a place or
person?

Thanks, Chas.
