Subject: re: engine removal

        Well yesterday I started disconnecting everything from the engine in
order to remove it to fix my little 'compression problem' but I just have
one quick question:  Is it necessary to remove the muffler and the exhaust
system first or is it easy enough to simply drop the whole engine connected
to the exhaust and muffler out the bottom.  Actually make that two
questions: how do you remove the distributor from the cranckcase, there is
that one bolt to the right of the distrubutor which connects the distributor
to the cranckcase but it is obstructed by the vacuum advance and even
unscrewing the two screws which hold the vacuum advance to the distributor
seems to do nothing, there is still that internal connection between the
vacuum advance and the distributor. 

Thanks in advance
