Subject: Re: Removing type 4 engine, limited headroom

&gt; So - remove everything above the level of the fan housing, and the rear
&gt; bumper, drag out on greased board or whatever - can it be done?  If no one
&gt; knows, I will have to get a tape measure out and guess.

Same type of problem at my house. I have one of those large one piece garage
doors that limits my height. I backed my bus in, pulled the carbs (type 4,
no fan to deal with) drop the engine with the jack and ease the beast off
the jack underneath the engine bay. Being I only have one jack, I move the
jack back under the trans and lift just enough to slide the engine out
(smooth garage floor).

Its one of those, don't have a bunch of help to do the job things.

As for working on the engine, I do it all on the floor. That thing is way to
heavy.
