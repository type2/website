Subject: [T2] primo 71 transvair bus for sale

I have a completely restored 71 bus with a corvair 110 hp motor and corvair
transaxle, it has been in shows , very clean, also has westy interior, this
bus is aqua green bottm and off white top, I bought the transvair kit about
ten years ago and it fits and runs like a dream, no more driving in the slow
lane.
 I have to go and will be back on friday asking 4,000.00 but the torque
converter is leaking bad ...so if I fix it it will be 4,000.00 if you buy as
is I WOULD CONSIBER 2500.00  .
paint is awsome, interior is awesome . 2 years i had the whole front end
rebuilt .engine has less than 75,000 miles on it and just recently I had the
heads done by FF HEADS in riverside calif. they installed all new valve
seats. it has dual exhaust and all new brakes ,hoses calipers ,drums pads
and shoes and I even installed a new vacume assit unit for the brakes,
 I have had this bus in this configuration for 11 years and it has been
totally reliable......._dot_call me at (909) 678-4968 thats in Lake Elsinore
Calif
