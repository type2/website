Subject: 50th Birthday of the Transporter

   Hi all,

   March 8 2000 is apparantly the 50th Anniversary of the first Transporter
   rolling off the production line in the Fatherland.
   Any celebrations being planned in the northern hemisphere?
   In Sydney,Aust.we are holding a big birthday party on Sun.March 19 and
   will have a line up of Transporters from 1950 to 2000 year models.

   If you don't turn up in a transporter you'll have to park outside
   so the car park will be wall to wall Transporters/Kombis/Pickups
   of all shapes and condition.
   We did this two years ago for the 60th birthday of the Beetle
   and had several thousand Beetles show up.Made the local news here.
   My '92 will be part of the display and I'll be taking lots 'o pics
   with a digital camera.

   Anybody with a VW web page wanna host a few pics of a sea of Kombis?

   Also,if anyone else is close enough to be able to attend the event,
   feel free to email me if you want any more info.

   Cheers,
   Steve O.
