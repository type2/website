Walter,
I have twin weber carbs on my westy too, however i have the performance
edition, which have no choke at all, I haven't had a chance to try it in the
freezing weather but in 50-60 degrees it starts right up with a few pumps on
the gas, but I have to let it warm up for a while, since there is no choke.
Shawn
