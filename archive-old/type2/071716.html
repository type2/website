Subject: FS: '76 bus...$275, SLC, Ut

I don't know where I'd park it or I'd be interested.  Four garages 
filled with thirteen vehicles.  I'm working on therapy.

 From tonights Deseret News Classifieds:

76 VW Bus, good engine, body.  Needs axle and other minor parts
801-2503151

Call them, not me.

On the subject of axles.  I had two axles milled and rebuilt for $69 
each a t CV Axles Express, 2100 south and 300 West,  SLC.  Supposedly 
lifetime warrantee.  We'll see.

Have fun
