&gt;78 T-II, all stock original. Motor is in fine condition, compression good,
&gt;and running very well. 
&gt;
&gt;Starts cold and idles perfectly for 45 seconds ±, then dies. Will restart
&gt;fine but then not idle for 2 or 3 minutes until warm, then all is good
&gt;again. This symptom is repeatable and consistant over several months now.
&gt;During event, all the following have been verified. Fuel pressure good,
&gt;temp sensor new, bypass valve tested nominal, all ignition components good,
&gt;pulse from ECU to injectors is good, AFM is young and functional, no vacuum
&gt;leaks. Mixture is right when warm.
&gt;
&gt;What am I missing??????? Has anyone had this symptom???

Problem resolved. Having validated every item that might cause the symptom,
the next step in the Bentley procedure is &quot;replace the computer&quot;. Rather
than doing that, I pulled the old one, removed the cover, and scruitinzed
the solder joints with a magnifying lens. Sure enough, at one resister and
one trisister joint I saw evidence of heat stress.

No new or reman ECU available. Got the correct ECU used from Avvers in
Longview, WA, a consistant good source through the years for experienced VW
parts.

Put in the new (used) ECU. Fired it up. Symptom gone. Reset
timing/idle/mixture. Nominal function.

A correct ECU failure diagnosis. I replaced a Bosch ECU on a Saab once and
one on a VW. All the rest have been Digi-Fail ECU's by others on
Wasserboxers. Perhaps 3 or 4 of those, in 9 years of servicing European
vehicles for to earn my keep.
