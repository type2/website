Twas' rit:
&gt;You're question is
&gt;perceptive, as the problem isn't cars, or speed limits, or traffic, or
&gt;population, or the economy, or education, or whatever; it's attitude. If I
&gt;believe that I always come first, its always going to piss me off that you
&gt;are in the way. If I don't respect you as a human being, then I'm going to
&gt;let you know about it.
When folks honk at me, I just smile and wave (most of the time).
Well put. Here in the Sili-clone valley, the attitude is toward
more=faster=better. I still don't understand how a person can justify a
$200K Lotus to sit in traffic in. Perhaps the cell phone looks better in
it. I drive Volkswagons because I don't need to go 130mph through the Santa
Cruz mountains. I'm not in a hurry. If someone really needs to get by me, I
pull over and wave. I will probably arrive a couple minutes later then
them, but if something goes wrong, I know I can usually fix it. I can't
even see the engine under the hood of my neighbor's SUV.  Even though we
must live/work in a fast paced, high tech society, I prefer to drive my
slow(er) paced, low tech cars.
