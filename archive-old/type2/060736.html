Subject: Pointless post - what I did to the 73 last night.

No point to any of this message, just felt like talking.  

I Did a few things to the 73 last night - getting ready for a 1500 mile
trip next week :-).  

I've had an electrical problem for the last few months.  Lights would
flicker while at idle and overall, the electrical system had a feeling
of frailty to it.  I started at the battery and got lucky - turned out
the positive side terminal end on my battery cable was loose where the
wires attached to it.  I took it apart, cleaned the snot out of it and
put it back together and all my electrical gremlins vanished.

Also replaced the poly-eurythene (sp?) shift coupling I had installed
earlier this year with a plain old cheap rubber one.  MUCH nicer.  No
more shifter rattling/humming and the noise level is much lower now.
Don't use the hard couplings unless you're building a race car.

Removed the main heat pipe I had installed earlier this year and now
have it 'triple' insulated.  I had just run a single wall, 4&quot; vent pipe
originally.  So I installed a second pipe in the middle of the first one
with a layer of insulation between them and then wrapped the outside
pipe in insulation and duct-taped the whole shebang.  Should be more
efficient now.

Also discovered 1 broken heater cable that I'll replace tonight along
with a split cv joint boot that must have just occurred in the last 2
weeks.  Now just an oil change, valve job, ignition check, and carb
synchronization check and I'm ready to roll!
