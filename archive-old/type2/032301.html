Subject: New Fuel pump, same problem...:(
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.SOL.4.20.0104301817310.13772-100000_at_csa.bu_dot_edu&gt;


After pondering on my fuel pump all night, losing much sleep. I awoke this
morning determined to at least get fuel to my injectors and work from
there. I would like to thank everyone for their responses, they were very
helpful, and I need further assitance.

Disconnected fuel pump and hooked a volt meter up in its place. Turned
starter.... 12 volts! 

Reconnected fuel pump and got under starter. Pulled the push connector
from the double relay and touched to to the  + terminal. I can hear two
distinct clicks . One from the double relay (as it should) and
one from,
yes, the fuel pump. But no buzz or hum from the pump. I hold the connector
on the terminal for a while and I
can faintly hear gas moving, but not at the volume i think it should be
moving. 

Reconnected the push connector to the correct terminal on the starter and
wired the fuel pump to ignition so that i could be by the engine with the
pump on. Switched on ignition... hear the click on the pump. open the bolt
on the left fuel rail... nothing... not even the smell of gas. 

At that point I came to the conclusion that the pump that I bought was a
bum one. So I went to my vw guy who could build 3 complete busses from his
stock room and asked for a pump. He pulls out a dingy one and sells it to
me, $50. 
I got home hooked it up. Gas leaked from the tank side in the process
but was dry on the &quot;out&quot; side.  This new  pump  doesn't click, but doesn't seem to
hum either. complete silence. After a while it did seem to heat
up. eventually up the point where it was non-touchable, at which point i
turned it off. Apperantly no gas to cool it. Same deal, no matter how I
powered the pump (direct,relay,etc) Checked the fuel rail bolt again and nothing. I then
disconnected the fuel line at the cold start valve and operated the
pump. Again, no gas or gas smell. 

Am I doing something wrong or am I just the most unlucky person alive to
get 2 bad pumps? I tried to test the original pump out by setting up a
mini tank and return line but didn't pump anything when 12v was applied.

Very Frustrated on Cape Cod,
