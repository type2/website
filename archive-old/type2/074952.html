Subject: Re: [T2] spare tire and bus jack

I highly recommend the scissors jack sold by the Bus Depot. $34.95 is
extremely cheap insurance for a far more stable and easier cranking jack
than the stock bilstein.

&gt;the trip I realized that I didn't have a tire jack in-
&gt;case I got a flat! Great spare but no jack!
&gt;Fortunately, I didn't need it but... If anyone out
&gt;there has a bus jack they can part with cheap...
&gt;please let me know - I sure would like to buy it and
&gt;carry it!
