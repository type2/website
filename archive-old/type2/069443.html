Subject: '66 hubcap clips

Hi!

I just received shipments of bus stuff from various places.  Since the Ebrun
Volksfest is this coming weekend, I might as well get the bus purdy (as
purdy as a banged up, daily driven, northern bus with miss-matched seats can
look).

I have 4 hubcaps, but two of the wheels are missing clips.  I got extra clips
in this shipment of stuff, but I'm not sure how/what tool to use to put the
rivits in with.

Any hints appreciated.

...Markus
