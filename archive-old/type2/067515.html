&gt; I drove a Vanagon w/ auto trans and it was a true pig...

So I wrote:
I like my 78 Westy with auto trans quite a bit.
In fact, this summer I drove it over really outrageous
washboard roads that caused my former 79 manual tranny Westy
to pop out of gear dozens of times and the auto trans handled
without even a growl, hesitation, or a whimper.
Passed the Baja torture test with flying colors.

My pan seal's been leaking a bit lately. I found that it drove basically OK
with over a quart less fluid than full. Further evidence of general 
robustness of the design.

Auto tranny shop guy tells me these things commonly go 250K miles between 
rebuilds, and no clutch plates to replace. What will you get out of a 
manual tranny?

Can't push start it, so I keep a second battery and an extra starter.
No trouble so far, and it leaves an extra hand free to do stuff like
tag radar detectors in the other cars with my zapper. ;-)

Drive safely,
Surfer Bob
