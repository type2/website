You know, my political views are like this.  See, there's govt and then
there's the people.asdjf;lajdfa yada yada yada

 - just kidding - :)

Hello all,
I've been on the sidelines for a while because work's been kinda crazy. 
I just thought I'd let anyone that's in the Long Beach, CA area know
that there's a nice looking green bus for sale.  It looks like a 76 with
a pop top.  body looks really nice with no rust.  It's also an
automatic.  I am sooooooooooooooooooooo tempted to get it myself, but...
I just got my orange bus and ONE project is enough!!

So, if you're interested and know the long beach area, it's in the
vicinity of 4th and xemino, on 4th, a wee bit west of xemino.  I didn't
get the phone number on the bus and there wasn't a price.

Later,
Mike

&gt; Be a
&gt; 
&gt; Nader Trader !
&gt; 
&gt; We've all heard it: &quot;A vote for Nader is a vote for Bush.&quot; Wouldn't
&gt; it be great if you could both vote for Ralph Nader AND against George
&gt; W. Bush? Now you can-- become a Nader Trader. If you live in a swing
&gt; state, contact a Gore-voting friend in a strongly Bush-leaning state
&gt; and informally agree that your friend will vote for Nader, while you
&gt; will vote for Al Gore.
&gt; 
&gt; Becoming a Nader Trader hurts George W. Bush, helps Al Gore, and will
&gt; increase the national totals for Ralph Nader and the Green Party.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Now you have a chance to do something you've never done before.
&gt; 
&gt; Think Locally.
&gt; 
&gt; Vote Nationally.
