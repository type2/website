&lt;&lt; Driving home today from work when all the sudden, while cruising in 3rd
 gear, BANG.... (engine revving due to no load being put on it..) grind
 grind........ press clutch and it feels exactly the same..... No gear gives
 me any reaction...... coast to a stop, do a visual inspection..... looks
 all intact...... clutch feels exactly the same..... (new clutch, p plate &amp;
 t o bearing).....&gt;&gt;

When was the clutch assembly replaced and who did the job?  Why
was it replaced and did they only replace those three items?  No other 
noise noted other than the grind?  When does it grind?  When you 
attempt to move the gearshift lever?  Grinds both with and without the 
clutch disengaged?  Any other problems or noises associated with
the trans before this??

&lt;&lt;..... I haven't drained that gear lube to see if there are chunks in there
          Doesn't it sound like a transaxle gone baaad?? &gt;&gt;

A gray paste over the drain plug magnets is normal, however, if chunkage
is present then gearbox is toast.
