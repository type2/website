Subject: Re: Low Rumble in 71 1600

Don't drive it much until you can find the problem.
I don't think it's anything to do with heads, they make noise, not vibration you
can feel.

You can easily fully diagnose any generator/fan problem by simply removing the
fan belt, and spinning the thing by hand to check it is completely smooth
without play and no out of balance object to make the fan roll back with weight
at the bottom.  You could have felt anything in there with your hand, though.

I hope you can find it's fan-related, but there is a strong possiblility of
something wrong outside that area that is either pure coincidence or the result
of bad workmanship in an engine pull and replace, or a lower crankshaft pulley
replacement.  I get the impression only the upper pulley is new.

This is not usual, did the fan belt somehow damage the upper pulley to require
replacement?  Ask why this pulley was changed, the whole generator change is in
question in my mind.  You did not have any symptons to report except the broken
fan belt and a related sound from that problem, why a new generator?  They don't
freeze up like it sounds you expect it did.  The bearing, if seized, will spin
in their location and not stop the generator.   They don't seize anyway, they
just get noisy and loose.

Fan belt life is usually shortened by a bent lower pulley, not anything wrong
with upper pulley.  Lower pulleys get bent during engine overhauls when the are
removed, upper pulleys never get bent, period.  They get changed because it's a
way to charge the customer more.

First, take out your factory oil bath air cleaner to provide access with your
right arm to the fan.  Reach in and feel the vanes of the fan, try to push the
fan back and forth in its rotation, does it seem like the fan is not tight?  You
don't mention it, did you already have the person who changed the generator
check his work to rule out a loose fan nut?  Ask him if he pulled the engine to
change the generator and what he did to tighten the fan nut.  Doing the job
without pulling the engine means it's likely he may have damaged the fan
somehow, it's really not easy to do the necessary dissasembly with the motor in
the car without screwing up the intake manifold integrity.

But loose fans don't vibrate your butt, it has to be something bent or out of
balance.  It is possible to have some luck that it's just a rag stuck in the
fan, I suppose, making it vibrate from lack of balance like your washing machine
on spin cycle with a pillow in it.

If the engine went in and out, hope it is somehow related to the clutch/pilot
shaft getting damaged in the act, ie the pilot shaft/clutch disc got mangled
during engine reinstall.

This should be evident by finding the vibration is conducted in the feel of your
clutch pedal as you push on it, just give it a soft touch at the speed you are
feeling the vibration.

If you don't feel it through there, bad news, we are looking for something in
the crankshaft rotation of the engine.

I can say that if you have a broken crankshaft, it will feel exactly like you
have described.  This means no driving it at all, the case is being severely
damaged with an engine run with a broken crankshaft.  The sudden onset of any
other condition to cause this is unlikely.

It is unlikely your work had anything to do with the crankshaft, or even the
crankshaft pulley related to the fan belt.  Unless they slammed sledgehammers
onto the crankshaft to reinstall the engine when it wasn't alligned with the
transmission, (that's tricky, you have to raise the trans with another jack as
you mate it to the engine).  I think it's happened to others that this occurred.

Go to the crankshaft pulley and get the factory beltguard out of the way if it's
still on there, so you can grab it with both hands.  It's dirty on the back, so
use rags or gloves to grab it.  Now push and pull and twist it hard, what can
you feel?  Anything but very small front to back play (end-play, should be
nearly imperceptible but many good running motors have lots of it) is really bad
news, you have a broken crankshaft.  If they did it, it should be evident from
contact marks of pounding on the crankshaft pulley nut.

Good luck.  I posted a hint to the list about how to set up the generators for
easy removal that saves you from risks and the original poorly conceived method
of needing to pull the engine and/or dissasemble things to remove this
frequently renewed component.

&gt; goes over the shims) put on a new belt and new generator.
&gt;
&gt; Anyhow drives real nice.  Now when it starts up there is a low rumble that
&gt; was not there before.  Idles alright it but the rumble quiets down after it
&gt; warms up.  this makes me think it is not just something loose like a tin cuz
&gt; that would vibrate regardless if the engine is warm or not.
&gt;
&gt; but when you drive you feel that low rumble in your butt when your driving.
&gt; It vibrates the whole bus so the sink and table and everything is just
&gt; rattling from the vibration.   Could it be from the generator or new pulley,
&gt; or is this the sound from loose heads.
&gt;
&gt; Would a compression check tell me if my heads are loose??
&gt;
&gt; Nothin left to do but smile, smile, smile!!
