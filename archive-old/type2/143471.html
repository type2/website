Subject: Re: [T2] Worked for me   was Project for sale, must go

I notice on here that there is alot of this doesn't work and you can't do  
this and that. So on those few occations I can prove other wise I will. I'm not  
trying to ruffle feathers or discredit anyone. It seems we forget that 
everyone  isn't running around with a pocket full of money. I've been bottom feeding 
for  many years and have gone through alot of time (some useful alot wasted) 
to find  the cheap ways around stuff. 
 Now I am a shop owner. I have people come in and drop a $2000  deposit on 
bodywork and paint. I try to not forget the people who once like me  have more 
priorities than there VW. So when they ask how can I get a decent  paint job 
for under $1000. I tell them to get some sand paper and some rattle  can primer. 
use as little primer as possible and as much of the old paint as  they can 
and do the thing then hit the local Maaco (or similar) for the $500  paint job. 
Buy the window and light seals and enjoy. For a couple of years it  looks 
great. If in those couple of years they get the money and haven't total  lost it 
or sold it then use the money to get it done right.
