&gt; Just bought a 1978 Type 2 Camper Van - Viking Conversion - chose it because of the layout and the heating system worked, but ignored the fact it was heavy to get in and out of gears.
&gt; 
&gt; Got worse and limped into a local garage where they pulled the clutch out and down to bare metal. They put in a new clutch and got going again - witin a few miles (about 20) it was back difficult to change gear again.
&gt; 
&gt; Limped home and got the engine dropped - the new clutch has gone in a matter of a few miles - the metal backing is blue and the clutch material is worn and broken up on one side.
&gt; 
&gt; Thoughts

I pulled a motor in a similar camper a few years ago and found a Type III motor
with a 180mm flywheel and clutch. Replaced it with a 228mm flywheel and clutch,
all German parts and resolved the issue. If you don't have a 228mm clutch, put
one in. Your van will have either a 215mm or a 228mm. If you have a camper
conversion you may have the smaller clutch. Check the part numbers
on your invoices and determine which size was put in.

In most cases the flywheel will be servicable if you break the surface with
emory cloth. However, if you have just burned up two clutches you will have
to have the flywheel machined by someone who knows the unique specs for VW
aircooled flywheels. Check the flywheel depth, it is critical. If you replace only the disk with the old weak springed pressure plate an immediate refailure is up and coming. 

Don't use NAPA or other aftermarket parts unless you want another experiment.
Not all discs are the same thickness as the genuine article.
