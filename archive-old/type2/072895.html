Subject: Re: '69-'70 Master Cylinder?
Message-Id: &lt;v02130502b32b1799fe62_at_[208.240.161.116]&gt;

 Bus
&gt;Depot sez '70 is Brazil, '69 is German.  I suppose you could cut off one of
&gt;the switches and rewire the circuit, but that's not my style.  Bottom line,
&gt;count your switches B4 you order.

Interesting. My 70 (born Dec 69) has the 69 brake cyl - original wiring
harness, so I know it's supposed to.
Any one wanna guess what month they finally ran outta the 69 ones... and
what happened when they ran out of master cyls, but still had the 69 wiring
harness? Or viceyVersey?????????
Friday!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
