Subject: Re: [T2] Weight distribution

hi John,

I go past a free, unmanned Oregon Department of Transportation 
scale every day so I stopped and weighed my 1976 Westy daily 
driver last week.  With about a half tank of gas, myself and 
some tools under the back seat it weighed 3520 pounds.  1580 
pounds for the front axel and 1940 pounds for the rear.  That's 
about 45 percent fron and 55 percent rear.  Of course I'm six 
two and two hundred pounds and that was with only a half tank so 
it can vary plus or minus two or three percent, I immagine.

Jeff
