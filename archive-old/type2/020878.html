GPS have a random error built in ..at least civilian units. THis should
explain the inaccuracies you guys have observed, apparently the
government doesn't like people to know where they are :-)  ... actually
its an anti terrorism/espionage thing.  More expensive units can only be
more accurate up until a certain point so the cheap ones may serve your
purpose adequately, or the ones that piggy back on palm devices (cool
gizmos those are) Personally i like the low tech aspect of my bus love
those analog gauges , spending hours everyday pouring over spatial
models makes me appreciate not having yet another digital map in front
of me. but you can't beat them when you are lost!
