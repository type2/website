Subject: [BP] What is this-Is it a compressor??

&gt; &gt; Since it's Friday, I thought I'd challenge the list geniuses to try to
&gt; &gt; figure this picture out. It looks to me like a homemade compressor, but
why
&gt; &gt; would it be in a Bug? The more I look at it, the more confused I get.
Look
&gt; &gt; at the electrical apparatus in there. It looks like too much work to be
a
&gt; &gt; dummy, lots of wires etc.

	The fins on the cylinders are appropriate for a compressor, not
an engine that generates power. The air-filter goes to a box which
has pipes going to the top of the 'cylinders'.

	What's the gizmo strapped to the runner that goes to the
right front cylinder?

	I wonder if the air intake and runners are dummies, and the
cylinders are solenoids- the reciprocating electric motor! :) But then
there would be big wires, not the spidery intake runners, going to
the cylinders. 

	I guess a compressor could use an intake filter and check-valves
for intake and exhaust flow. The electrical stuff could support the
fairly large motor required to spin this gizmo, and the whole thing
could be a trailer-mounted object, the trailer being the aft
end of a Beetle.

	Note there is sheet-metal blocking off the bottom, so whatever
else it its, it doesn't really require a flow of cooling air... 
That makes it sound like a compressor.

	I'd like to know the story behind it! But I'm inclinded to doubt
it powers the Beetle it's apparently installed in. There seems to
be snow on the rear fenders... so its parked outside.

	Bill
