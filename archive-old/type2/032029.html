&gt;     I have trying to split my case for a couple of days now and it won't go.  
&gt; I have a T4,1800.  I think I got all the nuts and bolts; 6 17mm nuts (bolts 
&gt; won't come out), 7 13mm nuts and bolts, 9 13mm nuts, and 2 10mm nuts.  I have 
&gt; not been able to remove the oil strainer but I did take the cover off.  Would 
&gt; the strainer hold things up?  So far the case has come apart a hair on the 
&gt; top but the bottom will not budge. I have hit it from every angle with a 
&gt; rubber mallet, knocked the notches at the corners with wood blocks, used a 
&gt; piece of wood like a wedge in the breather holes, and hit on the studs.  Can 
&gt; I use a propane torch to heat the seam?  Any suggestions would be 
&gt; appreciated.  


Here's a copy of my post concerning my own struggle to split the case on 
my 2.0l engine.  Assuming they're the same, you seem to be 2 fasteners 
short.  How about the long bolt down between the left side lifters, and 
the nut/bolt combo behind the flywheel?


I'm slowly tearing into the junk yard 1981 or 1982 2.0L engine that I
 may or may not end up rebuilding, and it's time to split the case.

 Tom Wilson's book &quot;How to Rebuild Your Volkswagen Air-Cooled Engine&quot;
 says &quot;there are 20 case parting-line fasteners on the Type 4.&quot;

 Here's my count of fasteners so far:
                                                   Cumulative
 ----------------Description---------------------- --Count--
 1 small bolt/nut at lower front of engine
   behind flywheel                                     1
 1 small bolt/nut even lower at front of engine
   outside of bellhousing area                         2
 4 studs/nuts along bottom of engine                   6
 1 long bolt in the middle of left side lifters        7
 1 stud/nut below oil cooler                           8
 2 studs/nuts surrounding oil pump                    10
 2 studs/nuts surrounding rear oil seal               12
 1 long bolt/nut at top rear, below breather          13
 2 small studs/nuts to left of breather               15
 5 bolts/nuts along top of engine                     20
 6 large bolts/nuts surrounding crank bearings        26

 so don't believe everything you read in books!

 At least Tom Wilson got *one* thing right; be sure you remove all
 the fasteners before attempting to split the case!  It's amazing how
 readily the case comes apart when all the fasteners are out!
