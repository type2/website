Subject: Bumper/Engine removal (Questions) &amp; Karma Part 2

What is it about Volkswagens and Karma?

A month ago I finally had the 65 Riveria flatbedded out of my driveway to 
be scrapped and that afternoon the crankshaft in the 1600 in my 68 westy 
decides it wants to see daylight again and pokes a little hole in the top 
of the case just in front (FIF) of the carb. (bad karma?)

One week later I'm talking to a stranger who knows someone with a bus they 
want to sell.  That night we look at it and buy it, a 69 Station Wagon. 
(good karma?)

I spend the next coupla weeks driving and evaluating the bus and finnaly 
decide: the under carrage needs to much work, the CV boots are all ripped 
and the CVs sing at certian speeds, the front end creaks and snaps (very 
dry), the bottom of one back wing window is rusted out,  there is rust 
under the window seals, the speedo is non functional and the 68 Westy has 
none of these problems - only a blown engine.

So I decide to swap engines (69 to 68) and use the 69 for parts.

The engine in the 69 does not want to come out (see part 1). (bad karma?)

Once in the 68 the engine developes a major leak at the front seal! (bad 
karma?) More likely just dumb on my part ;)

What does one have to do to keep the yin and yang in balance when it comes 
to auto repair/sacrifice?  Is there some secret I have yet to learn?  What 
are the prescribed steps to enlightnment in this regard?  Does anybody else 
have this problem?

Anyway back to the real questions.....What is the best way to remove a 
stuck bumper bolt when the welded nut has come loose?  Does a cluch pad 
soaked with oil need to be replaced or will continued use dry it out?  On 
the 71 engine there is a third wire on the generator that is grounded to 
the area near the volatage regulator - on the 68 engine this is not there - 
is it important?

Thanks again for the Bandwidth and in advance for any answers.......:)
