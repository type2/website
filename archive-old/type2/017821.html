I trust this isn't an utter waste of bandwidth. Which would be the
better deal:

#1. Private Owner, '76 Westfalia, supposedly runs great. I haven't had a
chance to start it...but consistent maintenance doesn't appear to be the
owner's strong point. There is heavy (not flakey) rust the length of the
side door channel. The front has many, many spots of rust boiling
through the paint, pimply and not flakey. The left side has a 1/8'' deep
gouge that runs the length of the bus...about five feet long, plus a
handful of door dings. It also has a football-sized butt bash under the
right taillight.

#2. Slimey Dealership, '75 Campmobile with what appears to be a
Riviera-style top. The body appears to be pretty darn good, though the
brand new (and putrid umber color) paint might be covering a multitude
of sins. The engine is in pieces--apparently it suffers from scored
cylinders. The previous purchaser bought it, discovered it had an oil
leak, took it to Molnar Brothers who said it was bad juju, tore the
engine apart and left him with the mess.

Both boxes are going for $1000.

My goal is to have a roadworthy daily driver/family camper. I'll have
about $500 to put into repairs right off the bat, with a $100-200 a
month maintenance budget thereafter. I've done some engine work in the
wayback past and have a fair amount of experience with grumpy vehicles
(Triumph Bonneville, '69 Saab) but I've got no VW experience.

Everything else being equal, which would be the better 1st bus? Is there
anything in particular that I should look for in a camper of this
vintage?

Any and all insights/opinions appreciated (private e-mail, of course.)

(My hunch is saying go with #2 Slimey Dealer...please don't let me hurt
myself.)

Thank you for your forebearance and sagacity.
