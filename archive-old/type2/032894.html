Volks,

  The PO had two seperate fans hooked to heat exchangers, which I know is 
fine and the front of the motor where a 3&quot; +/- hose hooks up I have no idea 
what that goes to. The PO had it covered with a piece of cloth and had a tie 
wrap on it to seal it. What hooks to that and can I just seal it and is it ok 
to drive car with my heat exchanger fittings not hooked up to the fans or 
should they be sealed too? Im sure a lot of heat comes up thru them to the 
engine compartment. 

  Thankyou ,

   David
