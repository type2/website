Subject: Re: [T2] Different Seats how about recarros?

&gt;&lt;&lt; I'm curious myself! I have a pair of lovely black leather
&gt;recarro seats from a BMW 325is, that I am wanting to
&gt;install in my '78 westy....but have not taken out the stock
&gt;ones to have a look as to how difficult it will be. I
&gt;assume it will be simply a matter of making an adaptor
&gt;plate for each rail with appropriate holes.....anyone??
&gt;  &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Check the height of the seat's seat...I'm just 6' 1&quot; and even in
&gt;the stock seats I'm looking out thru' the top of the windshield.
&gt;I added a couple of computer fans to blow whatever warm air
&gt;there is to defrost the viewing area...

I tried to modify a pair of Rabbit/Golf GTI seats. Nice seats but required 
ALOT of cutting of the seat frame to get it to sit on the floor. I did not 
ruin the seat but will have to reweld a could cuts when I use them in my 
Beetle. Comfy!

The seats wound up being too tall even with the seat frame flat on the bus 
floor. Put the steering wheel on my legs, and I was looking out of thevery, 
very top of the windshield.

Vanagon seats fit nicely. Porsche 914 seats I expect would fit nicely. 
Fiero seats I'd bet fit well. MR2, Miata, NSX, etc. Anything that has seats 
that sit on the floor would be be worthy of consideration.

Your BMW seats might but remember you'll need to fab new seat mounts or cut 
the old seat mounts off of the bus seats and weld them to the BMW seats.
