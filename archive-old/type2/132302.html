&gt; This isn't exactly correct either. NPT has all threads cut the same
&gt; depth. The difference is that they are cut on (or into) the piece at a
&gt; taper. A very exagerated view of this is a pencil point when
&gt; sharpened. It was cut at a taper. The threads just follow this taper.

the case and the switch are m10 x 1.0 STRAIGHT. there are no tapered threads
anywhere on a VW, unless they were modified, either by re-threading or by
threading a tapered object into the hole.  however VDO senders are m10 x 1.0
tapered. they will fit into the m10 x 1.0 straight hole, but don't
over-tighten them.
