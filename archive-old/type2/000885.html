I'm always totally clueless, and right now, I can add timeless.  My 65
project has a westy trailer hitch (woo hoo!!), but it is liteterally in
lockdown (Marital bargaining chip...no big whoop:).  Now the totally
clueless question:  Since I can't even look at it, when I get a stealth 3
hours, could I remove it from the 65, and put it on the 71, and transport a
trailer that would haul a little honda ATV for her birthday which would
serve the dual purpose of making her very happy and unlocking the 65 for at
least some new brakes?
