Dear List Members,

You mean it's NOT okay to run your hand over your bus and drool? UH OH!
Trust me honey, I know from experience to have a bus for the &quot;other
woman&quot; is much nicer than having the local gad about sharing your time!
But since I, not my boyfriend am the offending party, (MY bus) my
moralizing has to be somewhat tempered.

Busopia is much better than an STD. You can actually be glad when you
catch it! So be careful, you may find yourself having this compulsive
thing to get under your bus and find out &quot;what's that thing there?&quot;.
Plus there is this exhilarating feeling of independence when you
realize...&quot;Hey, I can do that by myself!&quot;. Yessiree, I highly recommend
going with the flow where the bus is involved!

Chris and Gus the &quot;I am NOT spoiled&quot; Bus
