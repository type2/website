&gt;How do the rest of you go about breaking in a new bus?
===================&gt;
Several necessary steps:
1. 
Make sure cell phone is fully charged and on your person.
2. 
Make sure your emergency roadside service dues and credit cards are all
current.
3. 
Load bus with plenty of oil, duct tape. coat hangers, and all of the spare
parts you can think of. Make sure you have a bar of lava soap, water jug,
towels for personal cleanup.
4. 
Have ready access to Muir's fix-it book and the telephone numbers of your
closest friends.
5. 
Plan trip as a short one, and schedule your return for no later than
Saturday night so as to allow an additional 24 hours for road warrior
adventures.

Another thing, and this is a tough one...........
Use all of the swear words you can think of during the week before the trip
so that you get them all out of your system before the adventure begins.
