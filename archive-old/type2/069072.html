Subject: Crappy Stock Muffler?

When I was playing with the bus today, I took a look at the muffler.  I'd
been smelling exhaust in the cab for a while, so i figured I had a leak.

I was very disappointed with what I saw: the weld on two pipes that go into
the top of the muffler had cracked, and I can see where exhaust was leaking.
And the two clamshell heater-jobbies had worn excessively from vibration,
letting my precious air out - the other symptom I'd noticed was a reduced
flow of warm air in the cab.

This is a Liestritz German muffler.

So I guess I need to get a new muffler before I asphyxiate myself.  I think
this one can be repaired with some artful welding.

I think I'll buy a new one, strip all the paint off, reinforce all the welds
on it, and weld down the two clamshell heater-thingies so they don't vibrate
and wear out.  Probably a couple tack-welds on them would be sufficient.
Then I'd paint it with a good high-temp paint.

I'm also thinking new heater boxes would be a good idea.  Any feedback on
brands, prices, etc?  I know there are some with and some without the fins
inside.  I want the fins inside.
