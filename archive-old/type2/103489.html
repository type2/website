Subject: Brake Fluid Dye

Hello.

I will flush my entire brake system with new DOT 3 brake fluid.

I would like to add some food dye into the new fluid so I can keep an eye on 
the new barke fluid (my reservoir on top of my 'new' rebuilt master cylinder 
is now clear and clean and transparent, so I could quickly notice if I 
exceeded my capacity and picked up air into the master cylinder).

I put 4 drops (green) in a 12 oz can and refilled my system last month.  I 
could see the fluid in the line and in the reservoir, and two weeks later it 
all drained out of the master cylinder thru the weep hole.

Any problems at that level of dilution or MUST I keep the brake fluid pure!  
Again,   M U S T   I keep the fluid pure.
