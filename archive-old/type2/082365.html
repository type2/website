Subject: Re: [T2] living in my bus

&gt; My first stop would be a library, in your shoes... or possibly a book

Libraries many times have computers with internet access that you can check
your email with. Frequently they have nice sitting areas and up-to-date
magazines. If you're living out of a bus, this makes for a nice living room.

I have a couple 'RV' books (The RVer's Bible and You're Home on Wheels).
Both of them spend more time talking about how to balance the load in your
RV, where to live if you need engine work done.

I do know the RVers tend to favor Wal-mart parking lots. Since they are open
24 hours there are always cars in the parking lot and you have quick access
to food and other supplies.
