Hi, this is my first time posting to the list after a month or so of
lurking about. This message, however, sparked my interest.

Just today, before I read this message, I ordered myself a new lock
cylinder for my '78. One day on the way home something fried on it, and
I pulled into a supermarket parking lot and couldn't turn the Bus off. I
ended up stalling it out, and went inside to buy some Cliff Notes and a
Coke (I was on the way home to study) thinking that it was just a weird
VW perk, and I would come out later and everything would start up fine
when I came out. It didn't.

We messed around with it for a while and found that the wires connected
to the lock cylinder had reduced to nothing. I do recal shortly before
the mishap, the ignition feeling very hot to the touch. So, I hotwired
it, brought it home, and hooked it the started up to a computer reset
button for the time being. Well, in a few days the computer reset button
started smoking and fried itself too.

I also read somewhere that putting heavy keys on the ignition can break
it too (which I did). So, here's my question, will changing out the
ignition lock fix the problem, or is there something else going on (ie.
drawing too much current)?

Any help would be appreciated, sorry about the length.
