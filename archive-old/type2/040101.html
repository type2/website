Bill-
      I suspect the &quot;stuff&quot; you're refering to is part of the POR-15 gas tank 
sealing sys-
tem. I've used it on my A-H and Morgan tanks. The Healey tank was done quite 
a few
years ago and still no leaks. The Morgan tank was done, mostly because it was 
out and
empty. I'm not sure the second coating can be used alone. You might try one 
of the ven-
dors, or the site itself to see if it can be utilized that way.
