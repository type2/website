&gt;Just painted a Chevy Van for a customer, and the material alone cost
&gt;$725.00 for PPG Concept single stage white.

&gt;Green my cost a little more beause of the pigment's needed to create the
&gt;color---

I just paid $735.57 for a gallon of Dupont Imron 5000 w / activator.
There is absolutely nothing in that can that could possibly be worth that much money.
( On the other hand, you can get 25 cans of Krylon _at_ $1.25 ea. = $37.50 (plus tax 8^).
