Subject: removing catalytic converter from 77 bus

Hi All
 
any reason not to remove the  catalytic converter from a 77 camper bus and 
just put  in a straight pipe ?
 
its a California model , but not registered in California anymore, 
 
my friend wants to drive it down to Central America and is afraid the  
catalytic  converter  will get clogged up with bad gas, 
 
Will it run any different?
 
thanks for your thoughts
