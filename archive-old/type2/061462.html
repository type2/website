Subject: RE: Where to stick your bikes???

It's a good idea in theory, but what do you do if the bikes obstruct the
lights?  You could put a lighting board on with turn signals fitted, but
not headlights (getting the beams aligned would be a nightmare).  I
suppose you could take the front wheels off (the bikes), then you might
be able to get everything to fit between the headlights.
