&lt;&lt; I would think that a pair of bolt-on valve covers would be much easier, 
and the aluminum ones with fins would seem to improve on VW's flat-black 
crinkle-finish steel.
 
 Do any solid-lifter T4 owners have any tricks for getting those stubborn 
 bails off and on when adjusting valves? &gt;&gt;

Try poking a rag under the middle of the bail, looping it through and pulling 
on it.  It works well on type 1's. Much easier and quicker than removing 
bolts with a socket wrench.

I saw_no_advantages to the &quot;fins&quot; on the aluminum covers my bus came with.  
They caught and held road crud and engine oil and made it tougher to keep the 
covers clean.  Oil leaked around the seals and through the bolt holes.
