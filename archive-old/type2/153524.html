Subject: Shifter Plate

Hey guys,

    I just removed the stick shift column in my Bus to clean up that area and
try to adjust the shifter based on some information I got from this list. But,
after removing the shifter, I discovered that the plate that goes between the
shifter and the floor, is actually broken. It looks REALLY worn out, and it's
actually cracked in one corner. The sides look really worn down as well. Does
anyone know where I might be able to get a new one?


Thanks!

Todd
