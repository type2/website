Subject: Happiness is a bilge blower...

Thanks to all the heat gurus who set me straight on
heat in an air-cooled world. 

I got a 3&quot; inch bilge blower today. (It's so
cute--white and blue--I hate to hide it under the
bus.)

Now, I have two stock VW aux. blowers to pass on.
Anyone interested? Cheap or trade for something I
need.

Also, can someone give me some resistor guidance? I
want to put in a three position switch to give me
high, med and low on the blower without melting the
wiring. (The '70s wiped out my high school physics.)

TNX again to the list and the archives.
