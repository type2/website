&gt; For the past 8000 miles or so I've been noticing an increasing vibration from
&gt; the rear of my 73 Westy.  I've had the tires balanced and even rotated them and
&gt; that had no effect on the vibration whatsoever.  The vibration is MUCH more
&gt; noticable under accelleration and even more so while going around a curve (left
&gt; seems to be worse than right, but both directions do it).  More recently, I've
&gt; also begun noticing a distinct, loud clicking sound from the back end while
&gt; going around corners.
&gt; 
&gt; So, are these symptoms associated with rear bearings going bad or just CV's?
&gt; I've never replace the rear bearings and they're bound to have about 240k miles
&gt; on them.  CV's have about 20k on them and were regreased about 10k miles ago.
&gt; 
&gt; Any comments or ramblings on noises/vibrations associated with rear bearings
&gt; greatly appreciated.
