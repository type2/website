Hi, Bob--

Several people got back to me on this--Mike and Kath both recommended 
studded tires, Paul and Sean and Joel talked about practice and 
handling.  Thanks to you all.   

Your post got me thinking a little more about this.

I think my problem is partly that I still haven't completely come to terms
with being an Aztec Sacrifice.  On those rare occasions when I've broken
traction in a normal car [eg, the Honda I used to have, or the Toyota I
had before that], I always knew I knew where I was, how it was going to
feel, etc.  In the bus I don't always appreciate how far forward I am [I'm
forever pulling 2/3 of the way into parking spots], and viscerally the
center of gravity on the bus just *feels* 'way high--higher than it really
is, I'm sure, and probably farther back than I imagine it, too.  In the
back of my mind, I think, is the tiny little worry that if I ever do come
loose from the pavement in the bus, I'll execute some cool move for a
different kind of vehicle out of reflex, and reflect on my error as I sit
on the headliner and look up at the driver's seat, upside down in some
ditch. 

So [apart from pricing studded tires] maybe Sean's right--Maybe I need to
go find that parking lot at 3am and experiment a little, if only to make
myself a little more comfortable with this thing. 

On the other hand--and before I drove a bus this line of thinking wouldn't
have suggested itself to me--maybe breaking traction is like a working
horn: the trick is to work harder at driving in such a way that it doesn't
become an issue in the first place. 

On that thought, I'm calling it a night.
