Subject: [T2] O2 Sensor

Volks,
  I have a question concering the O2 Sensor and Voltage. I have a '79 bus,
2.0L, with Calif Emssions. I just installed a Fuel/Air ratio meter and I am
getting some strange readings. First with a cold engine and not running, and
key on,  I hooked my volt meter to the O2 sensor and the connector going to
the Computer and I read .5 volts, now this is crazy to me, so I disconnect
the O2 Sensor and now the O2 Sensor reads 0 volts however the wire going to
the computer reads .5 volts. So why is the computer putting out .5 volts.
Any comments or suggestions??


Thanks
