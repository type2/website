Hello All     What are you talking about. the early Rabbits and such used the 
CIS injection.  tottally different from the buses and vanagons. CIS used 
mechnical injectors, fuel  amount depended on air flow. VW quit this system 
in 1990, and went back to electrical injectors. It seems to me that if you 
are going to change over at least change over to the new system not something 
thats old and out of date.  Just IMHO   Later and have fun  Mark Dearing
