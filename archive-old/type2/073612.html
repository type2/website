&lt;&lt; The dual port upright continued in non-us baywindows and vanagons for 
quite a while.  I don't feel that they lack any low end over the single port 
engines, but my experience with single ports is limited.. &gt;&gt;

Bentley lists both the 1600 dual port and single port engine at 81.7 ft lb 
torque.

If you_really_want torque in a bus, install a 2 liter GD/GE engine, listed at 
101 ft lb.
