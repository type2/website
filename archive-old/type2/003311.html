Subject: Re: [T2] turn signals

Well the turn signals did blink, albeit fast,  before they went out so I
think
they were/are grounded.

But now I get nothing. Also now the Gen light is on all the time. Help!!

Rob
Thanks for the thoughts so far!!

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Well now that the paint is done, I put the signals, etc. back on, but
when
&gt; I
&gt; &gt; tested them the signals were blinking really fast (including the GEN
&gt; lights)
&gt; &gt; and I knew this meant they were hooked up wrong. Only problem is that
the
&gt; &gt; wrong fuse was in the fuse block, so something fried before I turned
them
&gt; &gt; off.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  I have replaced the fuse with the right one (8) and a new turn signal
&gt; relay
&gt; &gt; that plugs in under the fuse block, but still no turn signals. The GEN
&gt; &gt; lights do come on now and the gas gauge works.  Any ideas? This is a 72
&gt; &gt; Westy, all original for the most part.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt; &gt; Rob Henley
