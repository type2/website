&gt; For Myself, ME--I find Snap On tools in all my drawers of my condominium
&gt; type extravaganga box--and for electrical type tools ONLY Milwaukee will
&gt; do.

I was a model shop machinist, before going back to college to get my
engineering degree, so I've done a little tin bending in my day, and on my
bus

&gt; However, whenever I seem to expound upon the merits of using good tools
&gt; on any list---the census seems to be I am a bit outlandish in my tool
&gt; demands, and therfore for the Bus / Van owner, whatever,  anything will
&gt; be just fine.

there are of course different levels of equipment for different levels of
need.  most of my power tools are Miwaukee or Bosch,  but if I only nood a
tool once to do a job, a level of quality that gets the job done
accurately without getting something that is overbuilt to do the job
intended

&gt; ( this goes along with the roll and brush paint job threads, Binks look
&gt; alike spray guns, etc. instead of spending some bucks and doing it right

if you don't have the bucks, doing the best you can beats letting the bus
get scrapped

&gt; With all this info in my walking database, I chose not to elaborate on
&gt; anything that I found that was NOT of a higher quality--just a tool to
&gt; &quot;get the job done&quot;, which seems to be of the most popular concensus.

one thing your learn in production and the world of business is that
&quot;better&quot; is the enemy of &quot;good enough&quot; 

you need to have the tools &quot;good enough&quot; to get the job done that you need
to do, if I were making my living fixing VW's rather than my own I would
have S-K (I think their better than Snap On but that is a personal
opinion) but my tool chest contains mostly Craftsman or Powrkraft.  

&gt; I would also like to point out that the specific tool I found at
&gt; Harbortowski freight--was not the cheapest I had found---It had a good
&gt; name on it too--&quot;Chicago Tool&quot;-- ( I have never heard of it ) 

if you are carefull and know how to select tools then you can get some
decent stuff from the harbor freights of the world....I usually suggest to
a begginner buying a Craftsman (or equivalent) &quot;set&quot; of tools and then
upgrade on the tools you use the most,  I have some really good
10,11,13,15,17mm combination wrenches,,  but for 8mm I use the craftsman.

you do the best you can with what you have to work with..  I'm much older
now, when I was much younger and had my first VW I sometimes took the
engine out with a screwdriver and a cresent wrench, but it was a good
cresent wrench.
