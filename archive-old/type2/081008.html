Subject: How much Gear Oil in transaxle

Listees,
    Could one of you look in Bentley's and tell me how much fluid a 1970
MANUAL Transaxle should hold. I drained mine and am refilling it. Another
listee thought it was 7 pints, but the fluid started coming back out on my
3rd quart (6th pint).
    Also, thanks to those who said to go to NAPA for the GL4. They had it
and were the only ones in town I found with it.
    And Thanks to all those for the suggestions on filling with ease. I
bought a hand squeeze siphon pump (as some other listees suggested) from
NAPA for $4. The hose was too small and the oil too thick to work
efficiently. So as most all good VW owners do, I improvised. The bulb (the
hand pump) fit on the nipple of the bottle very nicely. So I popped the two
flimsy flaps out of each end, affixed the bulb to the bottle and proceded to
fill her up. I also used &quot;MUTS&quot; (Mike B's) tip of cutting a hole near the
bottom of the bottle to speed the flow. (That worked terrific)
    This is truly a great list and each of you are a valuable asset.
Thanks,
Jim
