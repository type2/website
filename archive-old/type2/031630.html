but he is in &quot;Business&quot; and needs to make a living...the fact that he
shares any knowledge (kudos' to the others on this list that do so too) is
an asset, many refuse to say anything even if they know the answer...

my only concern is that this knowledge is not lost...maybe some way to

PS, I had a high compression &quot;S&quot; 1500 motor (type3) at one time and I tell
you what, it could go like a jack rabbit (not in a bus) but it was a
maintenence nightmare...to keep it running right took constant twiddling,
but I did have it up to 125+ MPH couple times too!
