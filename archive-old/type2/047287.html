Subject: [T2] type 1 ENGINE &quot;COMPLETELY LOCKED&quot; 71 bus

Busbees,
After having pulled my 1776 dp from my 71 *the free bus*  to install a new
transmission.  I spent the entire day *yesterday* installing it, and  trying
to get it ready to head out  to Pomona today, for the show..

While the engine was out I replaced:  the oil cooler, the o-ring* inside the
flywheel*,  and the front seal.  I also,  installed: a 2 quart sump, a
*SCAT* fan housing, and breather box.
Oh yeah, I replaced the right side lower engine stud, that goes through the
bell housing.

The engine sat in my garage for about 3 weeks while I worked on various
other busses, and got the transmission back, and installed.

After getting everything in and buttoned up *yesterday* went to start it and
(0) the engine is completely locked.  Put a wrench on the crank pulley and
again (0) wouldn't budge.

After first installing the engine I didn't try turning the engine to be sure
it was moving *damit, like I always do* ,  I just went ahead and buttoned
everything up and tried to turn it over.

Now,  I am going to pull it to check for where my mistake might be.

Questions:  Could it be that the engine locked due to: 1.  It has been
setting for 3 weeks and the engine is internally binding up?  2.  The oring
is binding up, inside the flywheel? 3.  The front seal is binding on the
flywheel? 4.  The stud that was replaced is in too far, or something *daaa*
and binding the engine somehow? 5.  The starter is binding up on the
flywheel? 6.  Any thoughts, ideas, from you all,  before I pull it again,
would be greatly, appreciated....

TIA


Bob
