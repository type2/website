Subject: Fuel Tank Sources

Hello All,
I need to find a new (or like-new or good-condition used) fuel tank for my
1979 FI bus.  Just to get a feel for what might be available out there in VW
Land, I checked a handful of well-known (to me, anyway) VW parts websites
about a week ago (albeit not too seriously or desperately) and came up empty
in all cases.  Now, it appears I need one ASAP.  Are replacement fuel tanks
available?  Can anyone suggest any trustworthy sources either locally (I
live in Portland, OR) or via the Web where I might be able to find and
obtain one?  I have considered just having my existing tank removed,
cleaned/reconditioned and replaced, but it seems that a simple replacement
is a more financially-feasible option.  Thanks for any avenues you can
recommend!
