Subject: Re: [T2] no oil pressure on fresh rebuild

Try priming the oil pump.
pull the pressure sender and squirt oil into the hole. I have turned the
engine over backward while doing it.

good luck




&gt; So, I cranked the car over for about 20 seconds without the plugs, and
&gt; the oil light stayed on.  So I figured maybe it wasn't cranking enough
&gt; to get pressure.  So then I hooked everything up, car started and still
&gt; no light.  Turned off car immediately.  Checked oil level, perfect.
&gt; Then I started it again and revved it a little too see if that would
&gt; coax the pressure up and still no luck.  Then cranked (without spark or
&gt; fuel) and still had the low-oil light.
&gt;
&gt; Before I go and kill my new engine, I thought I'd check to see if anyone
&gt; has some recommendations on things to check.  I did change out the
&gt; pressure sensor with another known working one (from the engine I pulled
&gt; out) so I know that's not the problem.  I understand that the oil has to
&gt; &quot;fill up&quot; the empty engine, but I just want to check to see if anyone
&gt; has any suggestions before I go and crank some more.
