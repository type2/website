Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Towing a Campermobile with a Vanagon?

&gt;I know this won't change anybodys minds on this, but have you ever done the
&gt;figures on what a semi tractor weighs in comparison to what it tows?  Here
&gt;in Kansas, it is legal on the interstates for a single axle semi tractor to
&gt;pull 3 full sized LOADED semi trailers!!!!

The semi-trucks are different in two ways (among others). First the tow 
vehicle and the load vehicle have effective brakes. I can tow 2000 pounds 
with my CR-V or my VW bus but neither vehicle can safely stop that load at 
the bottom of the mountain. I can't shift down and make out any better. I 
don't care what I can pull if I can't stop it I'm dead and more importantly 
somebody's wife and child are probably going to be dead too. Our Honda 
brakes begin to rumble going down a mountain be the car in 4th or 5th all 
the way down the mountain with a 1500 lb load. They are obviously HOT. I 
could with both vehicles restrict my tow speeds to 35 mph and safely stop 
but this brings me to my second point:

The tow combination needs to somewhat approach the speed of the traffic 
that they are sharing the road with. If traffic is running 70 mph, there is 
no way I'm going out on the interstate in a combo that will only run 45 
mph. The speed limit is 70 here in TN and traffic runs closer to 80 mph. I 
don't want to be rear-ended at 80 mph - 45 mph = 35 mph. 35 mph will 
probably put the engine and tranny in the back seat with my 3 year old.

If somebody doesn't hit you then there is still a chance that a last minute 
realization that you are moving at trotting speeds will cause somebody to 
swerve to the left lane to miss you causing a 3rd vehicle to crash. How 
about using the back roads. It would only take your trip from 2 days to 3 
weeks!!! &lt;grin&gt;

On top of all of that is the suspension. I towed a Hyundai from Norfolk, VA 
to Chattanooga, TN with a '65 Beetle riding a '69 IRS and balljoint 
chassis. I had fairly good brakes with a 4 wheel disc setup and I had more 
or less enough power with a Type IV engine slightly warmed over (maybe 75 
HP and I ran 55 mph to 60 mph) BUT the whole rig would wobble much like the 
second trailer on a tandem trailer semi-truck setup. It became quite 
obvious that the Beetle suspension was too soft. All of the body roll would 
move the hitch left and right which encouraged the Hyundai to move left or 
right which would then push the Beetle left and right magnifying the wobble 
or wandering.

In a hard braking situation the whole thing wanted to jackknife as the 
cargo the Hyundai was carrying (all my tools) was heavier than the Beetle 
with all my clothes and music in it.

Furthermore climbing Signal Mountain in Chattanooga which is pretty steep 
for a TN mountain in a couple places threatened to blow a CV joint. In 
situations where the body was rolling b/c of a banked road (or the 
transition form flat to banked) would cause the newly packed CV's to pop 
like firecrackers.

Your Vanagon is heavy enough to pull the load PROBABLY based on the weight 
of the average pickup truck and what they are rated for but the rest of 
your Vanagon is not up for the pull IMHO. Not enough brakes, not a strong 
enough suspension (swaybars), and not enough HP to maintain reasonable 
speeds. Your CV joints may not like the trip either. There is a reason the 
owner's manual says your vehicle is rated for 1500 pounds or so of trailer.

This is just my opinion.

Rent or borrow a pickup or V-6 van or ??? I pulled a '72 steeltop Westy 
from North Georgia to Cookeville (150 miles and 2 1/2 mountains?) with no 
problems with brakes or HP and it was rated for the load. It was 4WD V-6 
Toyota which might have helped in the heavy duty truck parts department. 
I've pulled a Westy across town with my Westy and it does fine at 40 mph 
and below. Above that it becomes clear my vehicle is not up to the task.

  Let us know how you make out with your project!
