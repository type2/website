Subject: Re: New Bus Nightmare

Rodney and the list,

  I was extremely saddened to hear about the problems you had getting the bus 
home. I really wish you would have given me the benefit of the doubt since 
talking with you on the phone when you were towing the bus back home on 
Thursday. You stated to me that you would give us the number to the repair 
shop, so that I too would be able to talk with the mechanic. And thus far it 
is only stated that he (the mechanic) thinks it is a rod. I spoke with you 
twice on the phone since the problem and have not had a response from you at 
all. This was the first I heard of the diagnosis. You went to the list before 
you even contacted me??!!! I really don't understand this. 
  You  wanted photo's of the bus but we suggested a video since we had the 
equipment to do so. You agreed to this. We did not force or misrepresent this 
bus to you in any way. I gave all the information about the bus before hand. 
I did not hide or mislead you in any way. Our intention of going to Atlanta 
was to show the bus, it was your decision to make the sale. 
  You did not fly 350 miles to see the bus as you make it out, it was my 
understanding you were there on a business trip provided by the petroleum 
company you work for. You could have easily looked at the bus, not taken it 
and had your company fly you home. Since the engine was rebuilt we have had 
NO problems. We have driven her on many occasions and down to Atlanta with 
not the first clue of any problems. You test drove the bus.... Without any 
problems just minutes after we arrived in Atlanta.(marrietta) if the bus had 
a problem it was not evident at that time. You stated to me that almost 
immediately after initially driving the bus you had problems with the 
accelorator hanging up and going into a full rev. I really wish you would 
have contacted me so I could have tried to make things right before you tried 
to drive it home to Mobile,Al,  doing more damage to the engine. 
  There was a question concerning a sentence in the BILL OF SALE you brought 
us... (This vehicle is free from all encumbrances except)....... We deemed 
this to mean no monies owed on this vehicle. I have never sold any vehicle as 
anything but AS IS.........we were not hiding anything. Selling &quot;AS IS&quot; is 
the only way I would sell a vehicle, especially this age. You even stated 
that you would not sell a five (5) year old vehicle without AS IS!!!???? I 
understand your disappointment in the mechanical problems, but I was not even 
given a chance to make things right before posting to the list, which I feel 
is highly inappropriate. We took GREAT pride in the ownership and restoration 
of this bus. All problems even possible known problems were disclosed. Again 
I feel in was highly inappropriate in not contacting me first as you agreed 
while talking with you on your cell phone while towing the bus back to 
Mobile. I feel you have tried to make me out to be a shady character. This 
really bothers me, since you have not given this thing an opportunity, before 
posting this problem to the list. You have my e-mail and phone number.
