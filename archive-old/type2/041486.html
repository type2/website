Subject: Vanagon Seats in a 74 Bus

Hey Guys &amp; Gals,

I've always heard that seats from a VW Vanagon are the perfect fix for worn
out and uncomfortable Bus seats.  Well, I went to the junk yard and found a
Vanagon.  Pulled the seats and tried to put them in my Bus.  No luck.  The
passenger seat in the 74 doesn't have rails (just a clip in hook) and the
rails on the driver's side have a different lock in mechanism.  Anyone had
any luck making this switch?  Am I leaving out something here?

Thanks,

Darrin K. Pierce
