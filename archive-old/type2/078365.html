Subject: Re: [T2] Transmission - TRANS-VAIR - LONG

I think the early engine I have is either an 80 or 90 HP engine. Don't know 
what the torque rating is but probably proportionally more than a VW.

I know you can move to larger jugs and and get more displacement.

The late model Corvairs had a bit more bore and stroke. They can 
retrofitted I hear.

The earlies are 2.4 liters (145 c.i.) and the lates are 2.7 liters (164 
c.i.). You can build a 3.1 liter (190 c.i.?) by machining in 2.0 Type IV VW 
cylinders and jugs.

The engine is almost complete - carbs, cooling, generator (can convert to 
alternator) and assembled. I was told the engine ran when pulled. Take it 
with a grain of salt of course. You'll need exhaust (don't all old engines?).

&gt;Chris, what is the hp of that early corvair engine?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How much power can the Bus tranny put up with on a regular basis?  Some
&gt; &gt; &gt;people use the Bus tranny for the Corvair conversion, what if you 
&gt; hopped up
&gt; &gt; &gt;the Corvair 6,  I also saw an adapter for a Quad 4.  Any thoughts?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mike Clark
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; And Mike if no one warned you - you have to completely rebuild the Corvair
&gt; &gt; engine so that it will spin backwards to match the input direction of the
&gt; &gt; VW tranny. That is to say the Corvair spins backwards normally from the VW
&gt; &gt; engine. It can be done with a reverse rotation cam, flipping the pistons,
&gt; &gt; new distributor drive BUT why do all that work for a transmission that is
&gt; &gt; still geared too low for all the new found power?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; There are two methods: bolt a Corvair engine to an adapter plate and then
&gt; &gt; to a VW tranny. Remember to reverse the engine so you have 4 forward gears
&gt; &gt; and 1 reverse instead of 4 reverses and one very low forward gear. Anyhow
&gt; &gt; the engine will last a long time rotating in reverse and the tranny will
&gt; &gt; last a few years (I can usually find replacement trannies cheap every few
&gt; &gt; years). If you are gentle with the tranny and keep it full of clean oil
&gt; &gt; (probably a synthetic) I'll bet you'll get a long, long life out of it.
&gt; &gt; Forget hard banging shifts as you race from light to light though. (Does
&gt; &gt; anyone do this?)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If you are sure you want to go that route I have an early model engine and
&gt; &gt; adaptor plate available for $125.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I went with the Trans-Vair conversion kit (there are used ones out there if
&gt; &gt; you look long enough). A new kit from Clark's Corvair is about $650. Then
&gt; &gt; you'll need an Corvair engine and transaxle. This is MUCH more expensive
&gt; &gt; but also a better conversion. All the details needed get attention.
&gt; &gt; Apparently you do NOT have to cut the VW to fit the engine in there (unless
&gt; &gt; you are building a split window conversion???) but you will have to cut the
&gt; &gt; Corvair tin to fit the VW.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I've got my pieces and am waiting (and reading) and talking with everyone
&gt; &gt; that has ever done one of these and EVERYTHING looks good. The Corvair is
&gt; &gt; not a bad engine but most need a little (cheap) attention in a few
&gt; &gt; categories. Things like new oil seals (pushrods) so the heat doesn't stink
&gt; &gt; of hot motor oil, carb rebuilds, cleaning up casting flash from the factory
&gt; &gt; so it cools better, etc. Typical old aircooled engine stuff.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; And yes putting a 1965 engine is a 1978 VW is a step backwards but not if
&gt; &gt; you plan on adapting fuel injection etc. (Of course no worse than a
&gt; &gt; carburetor converted 1978 Type IV engine). Not much was improved from 1965
&gt; &gt; -&gt; 1978 in engine design - that is crankshafts and connecting rods and such
&gt; &gt; - the biggest improvements were external and those I can improve.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I hear 80 mph highway hill climbs are quite easy and I can't wait to pass
&gt; &gt; my first slowpoke VW bus with mine (that will be hard because they are few
&gt; &gt; in this area).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The VW is certainly restricted by it's drivetrain and it's suspension/brake
&gt; &gt; package to operate at high speeds on the highway. That acknowledged - I
&gt; &gt; hope to see more modern speeds with decent fuel mileage, and the ability to
&gt; &gt; keep up on the hills. Everyone I have spoken to has said this is no
&gt; &gt; problem. Carefully built Corvair cars can get 30 mpg or better (especially
&gt; &gt; if they have had ignition and fuel injection improvements made). There is
&gt; &gt; even a five speed transmission being offered - it mates a Corvair
&gt; &gt; differential to Borg Warner T-5. Hmmm - how long 'til the 6 speed is
&gt; &gt; offered? Did you know you could get factory positraction differentials for
&gt; &gt; Corvairs? $$$!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am happy with 60 mph but feel that here in the eastern hilly Tennesssee
&gt; &gt; it's increasingly unsafe to be out there on the interstate running 10-20
&gt; &gt; mph less than the surrounding traffic. I have no urge to run 80 but 70 (the
&gt; &gt; speed limit) would be nice. We have certainly kept away from the crowded
&gt; &gt; urban interstate areas when possible.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; On a recent trip from TN to KY and back to adopt an English Setter we were
&gt; &gt; running along at 75 mph in our Honda on open highway when we caught up with
&gt; &gt; a tangle of traffic. Everyone was slowing, getting in the left lane, and
&gt; &gt; rushing on. We caught up and passed a late bay Westy bopping along at a
&gt; &gt; happy 60 mph. I understood but doubt our fellow motorists and truckers did.
&gt; &gt; I saw that as a significant safety risk being the slowest thing out there.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; We also caught up with a senior citizen fellow in a Buick running 45 MPH
&gt; &gt; (!) in a 70 mph zone. It was dark and we were following another car which
&gt; &gt; was not paying attention and which swerved to miss the Buick (boy did we
&gt; &gt; get a surprise!). We slammed on the brakes b/c I could not jump to the left
&gt; &gt; lane b/c of a big truck.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It's good to keep up.
&gt; &gt;
