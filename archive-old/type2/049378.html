Subject: [T2] 73 Auto trans for sale

Hey all,
  I am getting a 73 Bus and it has an Auto trans comming
with it. I do not want the trans. I assume it is good or
rebuildable because the engine was pulled for excess smoke
and a knock. If you are interested, I will let you have it
for $75. I am in Tacoma Wa. area so add shipping if you are
not close enough to come get it. I will include the flex
plate, torque converter, shift linkage and handle, whatever
you want. I am getting it for the Westy parts and do not
need the trans. (no there is no engine)
Scott Solomon
