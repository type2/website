Subject: Re: Type 3 in late bus?

Hi Will and the List,

My &quot;carefully built 1600&quot; that I alluded to in my post has some similarities
with your engine.  I kept the displacement stock because I wanted to be able
to get parts anywhere in the country and not have some very special pistons
and cylinders, etc.  So here's what I have:  Engle 110 cam, header with
single quiet pack exhaust, progressive 2-barrel Weber which has now been
exchanged for dual Kadrons, dog house cooler, full flow filter, 009 dizzy
with Pertronix ignitor, stock oil pump, 7.0:1 compression (cc'd the heads
and measured the deck height myself).  The heads have been mildly ported
just to smooth flow, not hogged out big time.  The pistons and rods
statically balanced to 0.1 gram (I know, I got really anal about that, but
all it cost me was my time).  I keep the timing at 28-29 degrees total
advance and run 87 octane gasoline.  I could bump up the timing and run
premium, but this engine runs cool and dynoed out at 75-80 hp.  I have
17,000 miles on this engine in my '69 Kombi and it has never run hot or
given me any trouble at all.  I get about 20-21 mpg at 60 mph and it drops
to about 18-19 at 65 mph.  I have all the correct sheet metal on the engine
including the thermostat and flaps.  I also put on the &quot;cool tin&quot; piece that
fits under the cylinders.  And, I run synthetic oil.  I have a Berg oil temp
dipstick that causes the oil light to come on if it gets up to about 225°.
This has only happened once when the engine had less than 1000 miles on it,
was heavily loaded and I was running 65 mph on the interstate trying to keep
from getting run over on a 104° day returning from Busses By the Arch.  And
then the light only blinked!  It has never come on since, and yes it still
works.

I believe that compression and timing have the biggest affect on engine
temperature.  7.6:1 is not too high, but I don't know what the effect of
running a larger displacement is.  I am nearly 50 years old, so I'm not a
kid and I know how to carefully build and run in an engine.  So, you can
build a reliable engine that is not &quot;stock&quot; and has significantly more
oomph.

YMMV,

Rob Dahlgren

&gt;
&gt; (more of the &quot;what are you smoking&quot; department. Answer: my heads)
&gt;
&gt; Rob,
&gt;
&gt; I have just started running an 1835cc and discovered sure enough, what
they
&gt; say is true--non-stock Type 1 configurations DO run HOT!  Man do I enjoy
the
&gt; extra power over my old stock single port (in a '70 Westy), but I expect
&gt; that it won't last forever. . .
&gt;
&gt; Got the pistons and cylinders (92mm) on a trade, so I decided to use them
&gt; despite their reputation for overheating.  Rebuilt dual-port heads with
&gt; stock valves, Solex progressive carb, Engle 110 cam, dual quiet pack
&gt; exhaust, doghouse cooler, stock crank, full flow oil filter.
&gt;
&gt; I set the CR at 7.6:1 which I thought wasn't too outrageous, but the head
&gt; temps are running 350-450 consistently, toward the higher end at fast
cruise
&gt; (60 mph), this is at ~92 degrees F ambient in Georgia.  Oil temp reads 210
&gt; but seems hotter than that--I haven't yet calibrated the sender (may be
low
&gt; due to JBweld thru sump plate).  Advance of 009 at 8 deg static.  Tin
sealed
&gt; pretty well.
&gt;
&gt; Questions for the gurus--I want to make the best of this--would it run
&gt; cooler with:
&gt;
&gt; a)  lower compression ratio (maybe 7.2:1 ?)
&gt; b)  better airflow from dual carbs or larger valves
&gt; c)  vacuum advance distributor (less advance at part throttle?)
&gt; d)  all of the above
&gt; e)  none of the above
&gt; f)  see you on the side of the road, pal
&gt;
&gt; I have a theory that the Type 1 cylinder head doesn't have enough cooling
&gt; fins to dissipate the heat of the larger displacement.  I am planning for
a
&gt; new top end in about 20,000 miles with new heads and 90.5 mm thick-wall
&gt; cylinders.  Things I would like to check at a shop:  exhaust mixture, and

&gt; total advance.
&gt;
&gt; Will
&gt; 70 Westy &quot;Rebertha&quot;
&gt; &quot;baby won't you carry me, back to Tennessee&quot;
&gt;
