Subject: re Buses as an investment??
Message-ID: &lt;3756A3BC.B41CC827_at_uswest_dot_net&gt;

We are into our 5th year of a bull market--with the advent of mutual
funds with entry fees as low as $100 or less--Why not use that as a
source of investment?  and just enjoy our VW buses for what they are --a
hobby?? Perhaps sharing our bus &quot;finds&quot; with other bus people who are
looking for a VW bus just to enjoy. Yes it is true VW buses are hot--
but hopefully that is not what most of us are into buses for--just
turning over and making money--i have only owned 6 VW buses in 21+
years--just in Phoenix--still have 2 of them,which is all the room i
have,-- the ones that were sold --were sold to make room for another one
that i prefered or finance another find--yet i still miss on occasion
the ones i did sell--but there is only so much room--Yet there are so
many VW buses!! Anyone that does has room for a lot of buses--must be
one happy VW bus person!!
