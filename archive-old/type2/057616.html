Dear List,

Regretfully it has come time to part with my 68 Westy I bought in 
February.  It's in good shape, runs great with the usual small rust 
spots.  It has a new fuel pump, carb, and german fuel lines.  I 
removed the tank painted it and had the inside epoxy sealed.  The 
interior is complete and in great condition.  I have pictures I can 
send if you are interested.

The engine is the third and has 15,000 miles on it.

I'm in SW Missouri and am asking $2,000.00 OBO.

Please respond to me at gcvw67_at_aol_dot_com or call 417-890-0275.

Thanks,

Greg
