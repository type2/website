Plans have now been finalized for the upcoming Full Moon in Joon campout. If
you've got a fast connection,
http://members.home_dot_net/fullmooninjoon/index.htm will take you to the glossy
intro page. If you've got a regular connection, you can bypass that and go
straight to http://www.members.home_dot_net/fullmooninjoon/FMIJ2001.htm. This
years event will be Memorial Day weekend, May 26-29.

Everyone is invited, 50's through 00's.

Reservations are not needed, or even accepted, in fact. Don't worry, though,
because with 940 acres there is bound to be plenty of room.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions, and remember - the
Full Moon Bus Club looks forward to meeting all of you.

Oh yeah, there will not be any RANGERS this year to spy on us, so leave the
rubber band pistols at home.
