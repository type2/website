&gt;  Some time back , one of our brethern in the UK replied to a post for
&gt;  info on the best method to prevent manifold icing problems on a t4
&gt;  engine that had been converted to a carb from FI.  Whomever it was had
&gt;  included a supplier and the cost for the gadget, which was a type of
&gt;  electric pad or cover for the manifold. Would you be so kind as to
&gt;  repost? Winter is looming and the time for procrastination is gone.
&gt;  Thanks.

Unfortunately this was one of the things that was specific to a type 1 engine

they are advertised at £24.95 UK [about $40 USA], inc p&amp;p, but that includes
local sales tax at 17.5 % so I guess the tax reduction would be about the same
as the increase in postage.

Address is :

sorry no fax or Email, but they do accept Mastercard.

Good luck
Bob
