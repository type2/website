Juli:

My wife used Quick'n'Brite (that stuff they advertise on weekend am TV) on
our 79 pop-top,  and when she was done, people thought the top had been
painted.  It doesn't look that good to me, but it does a fine job.

&gt; I am sure those of you out there in VW land have tackled the problem
&gt; of a nasty, grimy, mildewy, moss-covered poptop before.  I just spent
&gt; 2 hours up there on mine (I'm glad I'm in Georgia where it ain't cold
yet)
&gt; scrubbing with ENTNT (degreaser/cleaner) and bathroom foam spray.
&gt; I KNOW that I shouldn't go about sloshing bleach up there, but at this
&gt; point I am tempted to.
&gt; 
&gt; Give me some pointers, those of you who have been (up) there, and
&gt; tell me if I should paint, scrub some more, or get out the Clorox.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
