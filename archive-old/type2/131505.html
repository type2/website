Subject: RE: [T2] Whats the secret for removing push rod tubes??

Kerosene! Actually this is not the best but it helps break up that goo that 
many have plastered them in there with. I used a small can and a small wire 
brush to get it in those small crevices on the outside where they meet the 
heads and the case. I wouldn't recomment it unless you are splitting the 
case, the kerosene can soak into it and possibly soften the goo betweeen the 
case halves. If you can find a dowl or a pipe same Inside diameter or close 
you could slide inside the tube and use channellocks or big pliers to pinch 
them and pry them out with little damage to the tubes. These are just tips 
from the local &quot;Shade Tree Mechanic&quot;, but I have done it both ways. Hope 
this helps you John.

Were the easy ones oily?

Good Luck,

&gt;From: John Baker I have been working on a 2.0 liter 78 westy that has
&gt;BIG oil leaks from the push rod tubes. I am replacing
&gt;the seals, a few of the push rod tubes practically
&gt;fell out when I removed the rocker arms, but another
&gt;few are being very difficult!!! So anyone have any
&gt;tips on removing stubborn push rod tubes from a 2 liter??
