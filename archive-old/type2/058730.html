&gt;Well, seems a bunch of busses are going to camp around the campfire, and
&gt;perhaps visit St Mary's City, MD.  Like . . .


St Mary's isn't all that excitingly historic, but also available for all of
us more conservative types might be the Pax River museum to naval flight
test history (OK not all that impressive either but free I believe and worth
a 30 minute look), hey the kids can walk up to some old F4's or something
sitting outside.  Not sure if it is open weekends but I have lots of friends
working at Pax to ask.
