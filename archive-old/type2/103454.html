Subject: Re: [T2] turn signal switch retaining screws specs. needed

&lt;&lt; Apparently, some time in the past few weeks, unknown TERRORISTS have
removed and made off with the two screws that retain the turn signal switch
into its assembly--on my 1970 Westy???

If some listee would be so kind as to remove one, and let me know it's 
size, length,
and thread pitch, I would be much obliged......................

Duct tape it...................
