all,

i have read that using epoxy primer is dangerous on teh lungs without a
positive pressure respirator as a chemical canister type will only filter
out the really dangerous stuff for a little while and you will then start
inhaling dangerous stuff that doesnt even have a taste or smell... thus i
have avoided using this product at home.

anyone have any suggestions/experiences/words of wisdom?

thanks,
