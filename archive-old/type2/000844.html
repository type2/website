Kevin,

I agree with Mike, and it's most often the one thing that's not covered by
most warrantee's *Overheating*!!!!!

We have Brand New *not rebuilt* dual port heads in stock $125.00 each.

&gt; Hi Kevin,
&gt;
&gt; Welding up cracks in an aluminum head is an exacting and time consumming
job.  The ckacks have to machined down to where they end, the heads heated
to approximately 400 F, and then welded with an aluminum rod closely
matching the material in the head.  Then you have to machine the combustion
chamber back to the original volume and tap the spark plug hole.  I recently
purchased
&gt; two new bare dual port heads for $98.00 each, and two new complete single
port heads for $129.00
&gt; each from Overland Parts at 1 (408) 848-4205 in the south San Francisco
bay area.
&gt;
&gt; My experience with rebuilt heads is they usually have a lot of
questionable welding and repairs for a lot more money than you could find
new heads.  Email me for other vendors I have found that have sale prices at
various times.
&gt;
&gt; Oh yeah, cracked heads are usually a sign of overheating.  Check for
causes before you run your new heads.
&gt;
&gt; Keep smiling,
&gt;
&gt; Mike

&gt; &gt; I took my 1600 cc dual port  heads off my engine the other day to
replace some exhaust studs only to fine cracks at the spark plug holes.
