Subject: Re: [T2] instrument panel lights

Hints from Heloise:

1]  I found a 3 watt wheat bulb from a different car's dash panel that was a 
[snug] fit to the type 2 dashboard light's base.  That will be 3 watts, vs 
1.2 watts!!  This makes it worth while for the speedometer, but definitely 
an overkill  for the idiot lights.  [When I measured the amp draw on a 
lighted 1.2 watt standard bulb, and a lighted 3 watt upgrade bulb, the 3 
watt was just a tad more than twice the amp draw of the 1.2 watt bulb.  I 
also had a 1.5 watt wheat bulb, and the amp draw was almost exactly half 
that of the 3 watt wheat bulb.  Sorry, no way to mesure lumens...]

Again, the 3 watt is a snug fit, but I was able to  make it fit.

2]  From Michael Warner - If you paint the inside of your black instrument 
cluster with white paint, you will get more reflected light to the gauges.  
From Heloise - If you spray paint the inside of your black instrument 
cluster with a highly reflective paint like aluminum or silver, you 'may' 
gain even more reflective light to the gauges.
