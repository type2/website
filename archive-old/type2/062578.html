Subject: Re: Cylinder to Head Sealing Rings

I was just looking in my VW J.C. Whitney catalog and they had spacers for 
the inbetween the  cylinder and head to reduce engine knock and decrease 
compression.

&gt; 
&gt; In my experience, yes -- I think the rings are actually spacers. I don't
&gt; know if they were used to lower compression or to keep space between valves
&gt; and pistons on heads which have had the faces machined, but when I left
&gt; them out on heads which had them, the valves hit the pistons when I turned
&gt; the motor over slowly.
