Subject: engine lid seal replacement tips? - loaf

A few digests back, I saw this posting:

&gt; Hello
&gt; I just installed my new engine lid seal.  I went to shut
&gt; the lid and WAAANNNNNGG. It bounced right back up. So I look
&gt; inside and I see that the catch has an adjustment on it. I pull
&gt; out my big dog phillips and loosen said bracket, move it all
&gt; the way towards me, and retighten. I confidently shut the lid 
&gt; in hopes of hearing a nice click, but instead got the same 
&gt; WAAAAAANNNNGG. I slowly shut the lid and look from the underside
&gt; to see why this latch is not catching. Apparently the seal is
&gt; stopping it from closing. The bracket cannot be adjusted any
&gt; further, and I am frustrated. So any thoughts, ideas, comments
&gt; etc are very welcome. Thanks

I haven't seen any replies to this post; it caught my eye because I plan on
replacing the engine lid seal on my '71. 

Any advice/gotchas on this topic? Recommended/staythehellawayfrom  seal dealers?

Thanks,
