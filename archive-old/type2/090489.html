Subject: RE: [T2] needle bearing woes 

Tyler,

Depending on what kind of engine you have, there are two different needle
bearing settups.

Type1: If the needle bearing is bad on the type1 engine, you simply
replace the gland nut.  New gland nuts are less than $10 from any VW
supplier (busdepot charges $7.95)

Type4: The needle bearing on type4 engines is pressed into the end of the
crankshaft.  Unless you have a broken crank, you need to pop it out.  The
procedure that Mick described is supposed to work, but like him, I have
not run it.  My only experience with a dead pilot bearing in a type4 was a
bad one. The bearing had welded itself to the end of the crank and we had
to remove it with a cold chisel.  It was ugly, it was brutal.  try Mick's
procedure first, honest!
