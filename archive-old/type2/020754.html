&gt; I've finally gotten around to putting the transaxle back in my &quot;new 83&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; My question:  Is there a return spring on the release bearing shaft
&gt; on hydralic models?
&gt;
&gt; This one has none. I can't see one on my 87.  Bentley shows none (but
&gt; that does not always mean anything). My 77 manual clutch does.  Is
&gt; this the correct situation for a 83 hydralic?  If so what returns the
&gt; release bearing after engagement?  Does it just stay in contact and
&gt; wear the bearing?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks

Steve:
I don't remember about the spring, but unless you are putting in a new fork,
be sure you check for uneven wear where the fork contacts the TO bearing.
This is a common cause of clutch chattering  when one side is worn more than
the other and RIGHT NOW is when to fix it. I've just smoothed them off with a
hand grinder, but a file would suffice if you can put the fork in a vise.
