&gt; Anybody willing to pick them up and stick them in a box and ship them
&gt; to me? Pleeeeezeeeee?

This sounds like a trap!

Yeah--there's this 23 window deluxe in a driveway out in Oregon--the 
owner's just going to throw it away. Anybody want to go pick it up for 
me? You might have to smash the lock cylinder but I can fix that...

Just kidding.

Happy Holidays all.

Don, I hope you manage to find somebody to get those exchangers for you. 
I'd love to but it's a far drive from Chattanooga.
