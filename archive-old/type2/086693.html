Subject: high winds report

--=_alternative 005703C085256BC2_=

Been meaning to write to the list about my recent experience on Hatteras 
(NC). We were camped down there last week in our 78 Camper with Komet side 
tent from Eurocampers_dot_com. The weather radio warned of high winds, 
especially in conjunction with scattered violent thunderstorms. We took 
down out side tent in the afternoon after a Eureka cabin tent blew over 
and folded up. I would guess we were seeing wind gusts of over 20MPH based 
on Beaufort scale and our Komet tent was holding up fine, just loud. I was 
worried about even stronger gusts. 
We bedded down with the kids downstairs and the parents upstairs. The wind 
picked up until the whole camper was rocking and I could feel the raised 
top twisting in the wind. We were fortunate that the prevailing direction 
of the wind was from the back of the bus, so it was hitting the low end of 
the top. We finally dropped the top when we heard thunder and sure enough 
a bad lightning storm started. It seemed like the wind actually diminished 
during the rain and lightning, maybe this was the &quot;eye of the storm&quot;. The 
next morning the weather radio reported wind speeds of 23 knots which is 
almost 30MPH.
Our poptop canvas ripped around the joint of the bars that hold up the top 
(it's the original and getting pretty fragile) but that was it.
