Subject: Re: [T2] How hot can a head get?

&gt; My Redline/Weber EFI module has a automatic retard feature if the oil
&gt; temperature gets beyond 300 degrees or so. Perhaps programming the
&gt; megasquirt to do the same at critical head temps, say 450 degrees would be a
&gt; real asset. Any higher than 450 degrees, the metallurgy changes in the
&gt; aluminum head and things can go bad quickly. At least that is what I
&gt; remember.

Yeah, depending on the values that I get from the sensor, pretty much 
anything is possible.  Probably more realistic, and usable for that 
purpose, would be EGT.  Apparently, as someone said on the shoptalk 
forums, head temp sensors don't respond fast enough before your head's 
already in the red zone and getting damaged...

&gt; Perhaps you could program the computer to shut down ignition at 500 degrees
&gt; or to cut 1 and 3 on the injector cycle to &quot;warn&quot; the driver to pull over or
&gt; slow down?

Possible as well.  Right now, I'm just looking to get usable values for 
cold-start.  The upper limits were more just to figure out what to set 
the max value in the lookup tables.  I don't even know if the stock 
sensor is going to give me descent values in the range of 300-600 
because the temp increases very quickly with very little change in 
resistance.  The curve of the sensor is much different below 350.  Plus, 
the sensor is not mounted at the spark plug, so I don't know how much of 
a difference I'm going to see between the sensor's reading and actual 
head temps.

I guess we'll see soon enough!  I'll keep everyone posted.

Thanks!
Mike
