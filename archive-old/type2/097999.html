&gt; &gt;&gt; Since it is a 78, I only have one more year in California until the bus is

&gt; &gt;Bad news.  It's 30 years now.  Actually, they changed the year to 73, and
&gt; &gt;the rolling exemption will be 30 years starting in 2004, if they don't
&gt; &gt;change it again.
&gt;
&gt; What was it before the fixed year of 1973?

1966, IIRC.

&gt; Boy would it be depressing to get to 2008 and have them change the
rules again. What is going to ensure the the EGR parts still remain
available?  I imagine when they truly run out, proving that is a fact
will be exceptionally hard?

Tough question.  You can't predict what the boys in Sacramento will do.
