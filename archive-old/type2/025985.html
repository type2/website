Stan, 260 should be max, but you don't want to run there very long, 240 is
as high as you want to run for any time.

How do you know you are getting a good temperature reading?  I have a screw
in pressure gauge that goes where the oil pressure sensor screws into the
case, this gives me a very good reading on the pressure of an engine while
it is running either on a stand or in the bus.

But as for testing the oil temps, I don't know the best way to get a correct
reading.  If I used my oil pressure gauge method, the oil would cool in the
extension tube, so the reading would be wrong.  I supposed if a person put
different temp senders in different spots and used different gauges you
would get a pretty fair idea of how hot the engine was getting, but that
sounds like a bunch of work.

I think Berg has the right idea with where to test the oil temps, but their
testing unit does not read out to a guage, just the oil pressure light,
which is not good.  If someone would make a temp sender that would slide
down the tube where you check the oil (as the berg unit does) and read out
to a gauge, that would be a good indicator, but as far as I know, no one
has.

&gt; So the question is; How hot is too hot?
