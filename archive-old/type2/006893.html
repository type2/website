Subject: Re: [T2] charcoal cannister

Hiya Blake,

I'm the guy who posted the $61.80 price for the emissions canister.  This was 
info I was passing along to Tommy at the time.  For what it's worth, I 
ordered that emissions canister for my 1970 Bus (yes, they were onboard in 
1970) just last week and the $61.80 price was quoted to me (and also last 
year when I dropped in to check prices) at that time.  Regular VW dealership 
(Rey Reece VW, Portland, OR).

My assumption is that the dealerships have set their own profit margin (as 
with most everything else) on these older parts.  I do know that the parts 
guys at Rey Reece have been very helpful in locating and ordering these old 
AC parts.  And that is definitely not the case at some VW dealerships if I 
can believe the many posts I have read.  Perhaps the pricing philosophy 
follows the service philosophy?  Just a thought.

Mike
