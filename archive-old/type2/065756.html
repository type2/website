Subject: Bus Heater Recirculation Ducts

&gt;Hi Bob.  I have a question about heat in my bus.  I am taking your 
&gt;advice on creating a recirculating system on my own.  You mention in 
&gt;one of the sermons that fiberglass ducting might work well, that it is
&gt;used in planes.  You also said to ask if someone wanted to know more 
&gt;about this stuff.  Well, I am asking. :)
&gt;

Jim,

Making special-purpose ducting is fairly simple in concept but there are a
few tricks.  The simple part mostly has to do with shaping the things.  You
use crunchy-style styrofoam (not the stuff used in hot-cups), as used for
Christmas decorations, to create solid representations of the ducts you wish
to form.   You can find the crunchy foam in variety stores; I used to get it
at the local K-mart.  It comes in a variety of shapes but I stuck with the
slabs, 1&quot; thick by a foot wide by two feet long.  You can cut it with a
knife, saw or -- for more elaborate shapes -- with an electrically heated
wire similar to a cheese cutter. 

To make up the required thickness and length from 1&quot; thick slabs,  simply
join pieces together using toothpicks as temporary fasteners and dots of
Weldwood 'Plastic Resin' wood glue (the brown powder you mix with water).
 You can't use common white glue such as Elmer's -- they are vinyl-resins and
dry rather than cure.  A dot of white glue between two slabs of foam can not
dry -- it thinks it's still in the bottle and just lays there.  Weldwood
cures rather than dries.  Ditto for epoxy, except it's too expensive for this
task.  And you can't use polyester resin -- it dissolves styrofoam.  

 A good starting size for your ducts is a cross-section about three by six
inches and stick with eighteen square inches as a general rule of thumb.
 Design the ducts to match the contours of your bus but first figure out
where you are going to install your blower(s) and get them mounted.  (Be sure
to use rubber isolator mounts.  Blowers are noisy.)  Call the blowers one end
of the system.  The other end is the inlets to your heat exchangers.  As you
can see, your new ducts will have to be formed in pieces to allow engine
removal.  But the ducts in the tranny-flats area, the most likely place for
installation of your blower(s), may be fabricated so as to fasten to the
chassis in a semi-permanent fashion.

Be very careful selecting where to pierce the firewall or breast tin to gain
access to your engine compartment since the ducting will take up space you
probably use for something else.  It would be best to use a flanged fitting
here.

With considerably more effort it may be possible to fabricate ducts that do
not enter the engine compartment, although this would dictate new inlets on
your heat exchangers.  Alas, almost any effort in this area will present some
obscuration of the valve covers.  If you are not running hydraulics (ie, must
periodically adjust valve lash) this is probably not a practical option.

When you've shaped your basic ducts and figured out what method of fastening
you're going to use, round their edges and wrap them with wide packing tape
- -- seal them up with the the stuff.  The reason for this is because I want
you to use polyester laminating resin and the stuff will dissolve the
styrofoam if it touches it.  You could use an epoxy resin but would probably
have trouble finding it.  Polyester resin, fiberglas, hardener and silica
filler is available at most hardware or auto parts stores.

To fabricate your ducts, simply wrap fiberglas around them, fasten the ends
of the fiberglas in place with toothpicks, and saturrate the fabric with
polyester resin.  If you use metal tabs for fastening the ducts to the
chassis, put the tabs -- 1&quot; x 8&quot; strips of 1/8&quot; aluminum work fine -- in
place and wind the fiberglas over them, using floc or Bondo to fill any gaps.
 You'll want to use two layers of fabric, winding in opposite directions.
 The windings should have a bias of about 45 degrees, that is, 90 degrees
between the two layers.  For more strength use more layers.   Old bed sheets
work fine as the outer layer -- gives a smoother finish and costs less than
fiberglas.  (Since this is not a structural part, and since it is not
subjected to high temperatures, cotton or linen fabric works just fine.)

Designing your ducts is not a trivial task.  They will have to be made in
sections in order to fit them into the chassis without removing the tranny &amp;
engine, so put on your thinking cap.  You'll want to design the end of one
duct to fit into the next section.  You may use flanges for this purpose but
when working with composites it's generally easier to go for a 'nested' fit,
that is, making one end a little larger than the other with the expectation
of sliding the pieces together.

When your laminate is cured trim back the end of the duct to expose the
styrofoam.  Now pour a little gasoline (!) on the foam.  Styrofoam dissolves
in gasoline.  (Test this first.  Use a crunchy-style foam that will dissolve.
 DO NOT use urethane foam.)  You'll be able to pull the packing tape free
once the styrofoam dissolves, leaving you with a lightweight piece of ducting
'molded' to the shape of your needs.

To insulate the ducting, once it is installed cover it with urethane foam,
either the spray stuff or the crack &amp; hole filler kind, or the two-part,
mix-it-yourself stuff from a hobby shop.  A half-inch layer will be more than
enough..  Once the foam is cured, a coat of latex-based house paint will
provide adequate weather protection but if you want it to look like a
factory-job you can sand it smooth, fill any dings with Bondo and treat it
like a body panel.

&gt;
&gt;What size fan does a person need?  

A BIG one... or two.  The best installation of a recirculating heater system
I've seen used a pair of variable-speed bilge blowers.  On high they probably
drew close to 15A each and could suck a golf ball through a garden hose.  On
low, they did a fine job of recirculating the air in the bus.

&gt;I can't find the CFM specs on the 
&gt;stock system...

High.  The blower on an up-right engine cranks out about 1,320 CFM at cruz.
 I would guess about 10% of that is dedicated to the heating system 

 &gt;I will be looking for one with several speeds.  I have 
&gt;heard marine places are an excellent source for the type of fan I 
&gt;might need for this.

Right.  A bilge blower, other than those elected to office, is a boating
item.

&gt;
&gt;Also, is it is a good idea to remove the crinkly asbestos insulation 
&gt;on my bus and replace it with something more modern? 

I don't know if it's a good idea or not but I removed mine -- the pipe was
getting rusty underneath.

&gt; At the very 
&gt;least I expect to be banging into this thing while I am under there 
&gt;running a duct to the back.  I would rather the asbestos were gone.  

&gt;What is recommended to insulate it then? 

I used urethane foam.  I sprayed it on some Tyvex building paper and molded
it around the pipe with my hands.  Did a section at a time, let it harden,
trimmed it up nice &amp; neat then did the next section.  Did maybe 10&quot; at a
time.  (The duct under the cargo bay is about five feet long.)

&gt; Tips on safely removing 
&gt;asbestos, if that is what you recommend?

I sprayed the asbestos with WD-40 to cut down on air-borne particles and wore
a face mask as I removed the stuff from the duct.  Given my age and the
number of years I've spent aboard ships where all of the pipes were lagged
with asbestos, I'm either already dead... or the risk isn't quite as high as
they would have us believe.  (Hell, I even wore an asbstos fire suit when I
was stationed at Moffat Field.)

But before you tackle the recirculation idea, try this:  see if you can plumb
the driver's side heat exchanger to the duct going to the front of the
vehicle.  Normally, cockpit heat comes only from the right-side heat
exchanger.  If you don't have a gaggle of passengers in back, why not put all
the heat where you DO have people?... which is usually up in the front seat.

Also, do what you can to insulate your bus.  And remember it's a flow-thru
system -- you need to provide an exhaust for the heated air to escape or you
won't have any flow.  My bus is pretty tight, even around the pedals &amp; gear
shift.  I leave the window open until I feel a bit of warmth from the
defogger vents.  (Of course, with a recirculation system you want to do just
the opposite -- keep the bus sealed up until the temperature rises.)
