Subject: Re: [T2] Listie Locations,

If your going to do this don't have everyone post to the list.. waste of 
bandwidth and my account. Have one person offer an email that people can 
send to and at the end post the list.

Just a thought

&gt;From: Stevie Havoc &lt;s.havoc_at_telus_dot_net&gt;

&gt;Anyone else interested to know who is living in the same town etc ? Want to 
&gt;know something about a specific city ? Might be a nice resource.
&gt;I cant see it being too much work to tabulate locations/names and e-mails 
&gt;...
&gt;
