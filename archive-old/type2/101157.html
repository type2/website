Subject: Pull engine, Again

Dammit! looks like I am in for another engine pull from my 71 westy.  took it
for a spin yesterday and parked it in the garage and i see a big puddle of
gasoline forming under it! So, I crawl under there, HOPING that the fuel line
has somehow just worked its way off of the nipple on the bottom of the tank.
NO LUCK! Its coming from the opening in the  platform on which the gas tank
sits. The real PITA is that I just had a tank with a hole in it this past
march, at which time I pulled it and replaced it with a used tank from
BustedVW (or is it BustedBus?) Until I get it out, I won't know where its
leaking from, but does anyone know if BustedBus puts like a year warranty on
any of their stuff? 

Peace, John Baker
