Subject: RE: Fuel Injector question

Sorry Ed,

Nothing clear about this one. One email said that they were important, but 
this was like secondary statement with no explanations to why. I still would 
like to know, too. I am going to try my injectors for now until I move at 
the end of the month so that I can get most of the other if bugs worked out. 
Then I am going to send them in the be cleaned and such, they do install new 
pintles and filter screens.

&gt;From: &quot;Ed Poynter&quot; You posted a question to the Type2 list re. loose 
&gt;&quot;pintels&quot;.  I have been watching the list but have not seen a reply to your 
&gt;question.  Did you ever recieve an answer?   I'm not the one who posted the 
&gt;question prior to yours, but was also wondering about this.  I was putting 
&gt;new seals on my injectors and noticed one was as you described it.
