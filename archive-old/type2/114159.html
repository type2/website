&gt;We are all well aware of the need for good grounds on our beloved buses.
&gt;So how about this...
&gt;
&gt;I have seen many trucks and some cars with ground straps that touch the
&gt;ground to release static from the vehicle. If we are grounding to our
&gt;chassis, would not this method improve the grounding we so drastically need
&gt;on our buses?

The bus is insulated by four rubber tires. It does not need a strap touching the ground to improve the electrical system. It needs a good connection between every negative terminal on the body to the battery. Adding a better connection after a poor one doesn't help any.

Some custom vehicles I'm seeing these days have an aftermarket ground harness routed through the engine compartment. If it doesn't corrode it may become useful in the future rather than being largely cosmetic.
