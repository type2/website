Subject: Re: [T2] Turn signal switch

From: &quot;Jared Sims&quot; &lt;utvolk_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;
&gt; I can still turn my brights on, but I can't turn either signal on and the
lever flops around all over the place now.

Ack.  That's how mine was.  The two little fingers on the concealed end of
the arm were broken off.  I had to replace the switch.  Not too difficult a
job, and not all that expensive.

I do have one question for the list, though.  When you re-install the
steering wheel, does the turn signal canceling tab go to the left or to the
right?  (I sort of forgot to notice when I had it apart, and can only find
one of the marks, the one in the center of the shaft.)
