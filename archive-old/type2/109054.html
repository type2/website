&gt; I originally had my second battery installed with an isolator in the
setup.
&gt; I got a little disallusioned when my alternator blew and I didn't know if
&gt; if was possible that it got over worked.

I did mine the cheap way with a solonoid thing from camping world. When the
coil got power, it connected the two batteries. When the key was off, the
batteries were seperate. The second battery powered the interior lights and
other camping stuff. Worked great, I think I paid $20-25 for the solonoid
thing.  I even used some diodes to run the stereo with either battery, but
when turned on, it wouldn't supply power to the other battery.

Now if I can get to work on making my back seat into a z-bed.........
