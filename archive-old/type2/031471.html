&gt;     Quick and easy question.  Can I use a 009 distributor for a 1973 bus. 
&gt; Bus Depot has the 009 listed only up to 1971, and the 050 from 72 on.  I
&gt; realize the advantages to the 050 but I can get a good deal at Larry's Off
&gt; Road for a 009 distrubutor, bosch blue coil, and plug wires (79.95) and do
&gt; not think he even carries the 050.  So if anyone knows for sure if the 009
&gt; will work I would like to order it.

define, &quot;work&quot;

will your engine start, most likely
will it run, sort of
will it run right, probably never

get the vacuum advance dizzy to fit, it is worth it.
