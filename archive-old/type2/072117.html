Subject: Shavings in oil
Date: Mon, 09 Apr 2001 21:57:46 +0100

I just changed my oil and found some tiny shavings in the sludge that
builds up in the cover under the strainer.  They were shiny, looked like
aluminium and very thin, like gold leaf.  The biggest piece was about 2mm
by 4mm.
Should I be concerned about this?  I haven't noticed anything like this
before.  The engine isn't making any funny noises.  Anyone care to hazard a
guess as to what they might be?
