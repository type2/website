Subject: Re: [T2] Starter bushing

Chirco
www.chirco_dot_com
has a tool for pulling the bushing.  It is actually from an old VW tool.
I find it a very handy tool that even worked on my jetta as well as my 
type 1 engines.  Havent had to do a type 4 yet.

&gt;  Does anyone have a proven method of changing out

&gt;  I was thinking of running a 12mm tap through it, then
&gt; pulling it out with a bolt. Anyone tried this?
