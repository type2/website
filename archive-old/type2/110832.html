&gt; &gt; ... One of the local sandblasters I know here used to work with no mask or
&gt; the wrong mask and gave himself some sort of poisioning. Now can hardly do
&gt; anything b/c of weakness and such...
&gt;
&gt; It's a form of fibrosis, similar to the &quot;black lung&quot; that coal miners can
&gt; develop from working in the mines without proper breathing gear.  Being in
&gt; the resin casting industry, I sometimes refer to it as &quot;brown lung&quot;, &quot;resin
&gt; breath&quot; or simply as &quot;gross stupidity&quot;; owing to the similar danger from
&gt; inhaling resin dust (and I admit to having shown some occasional stupidity
&gt; on my own part in this area).

With sandblasting, it's usually silicosis which is just as bad.

My father did all the wrong things, worked with asbestos, smoked, etc and
is now 91 years old.  However, he is now on oxygen 24/7 and walking five
steps causes him to have to rest and increase his oxygen flow for ten
minutes.  It's painful to watch.  A lot of people don't realize that you
have to _live_ with your mistakes, not just die from them!
