Subject: Re: Oil temp sender installation

Hey Bill,

I installed an oil temp sender some months back and there have been no
leaks.  Unfortunately, i drilled the hole incorrectly the first time and
had to plug up my mistake.  Luckily, that hole has been leak-free, too.
Just be sure to observe the following:

there should be a template that comes with the sender (if its a vdo).
it shows the position to drill the hole, but you can still screw things up
if you orient the template incorrectly.  YES, it matters whether the
template is put on the top of the plate or the bottom - i really don't
remember which way.

he's what you should do: after you remove the plate from the sump, look
inside the cavity.  there will be a protrusion on one side.  if you
install the sender in the wrong position, the plate will not reattach,
since that protrusion will be in the way.  make a note of where it is,
then it will be obvious where to drill the hole

make sure you don't make the hole too large.  also, a drill press makes
the task easier.  be sure to use the washer that is included with the
sender.  once the sender is attached, seal the outside with some high
temperature silicone. 

while the silicone is drying, you've got time to run the wiring underneath
the bus.  even if you are only installing one gauge, consider running
several wires for future gauges (oil pressure, cyl head temp).  the cost
of the extra wire is negligible - you'll save yourself the headache of
doing the same job again (it takes longer than you'd think.)  some conduit
will make the job neater and protect the wires.  oh yeah, get different
color wires (to tell them apart, duh!)

whew!  i didn't realize i had so much to say on the subject.  don't worry
about the oil leak - just take your time and watch what you're doing.
your bus will thank you!
