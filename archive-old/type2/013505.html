Hello list,

I have a carb question,

I have a 32/36 DCAV carb that I rebuilt. How does the
choke work? DOes this type of carb need a vacume hose
to work. The distributer that is on my 73 1700 bus is
a BOSH 009 which does not have a vac advance on it.
Will this pose a problem? Currently, the carb runs way
too rich and I can't adjust it out. I don't know if
this has anything to do with it or not, but anyway any
help would be appreciated.

Thanks!
