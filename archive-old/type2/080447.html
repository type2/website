&gt;All of which reminds me to ask........... should the proper cap on this 
&gt;tank
&gt;be vented?

I don't have a part number for you, but I can tell you that my cap isn't 
vented. I've seen quite a few caps on buses at junk yards (in the Salt Lake 
area), so you might have luck at yards in your own area. As long as they're 
in good shape, you know it's the right kind if you get it off another bus. 
Or at least the odds are good.
