  There are 3 NEW SVDA's available that I have had.
OE VW Bosch unit
Bosch replacement unit
Bruck China/Germany

I have found the OE VW unit to be better then the Bosch unit. Maybe Bosch built them better for the factory then they did for the 
replacement market.

Both of the Bosch units I have had very good results with on everything from 40hp stockers to 1800 type1 based strokers I build. The first 
and only Bruck unit I tested the points wore out with in 100 miles and Bosch replacement points did not fit, it also had an erratic advance curve.

I was selling these for 100 dollars (OE VW units in VW de Mexico boxes). There has been a major price increase and I now sell the replacement 
Bosch unit.  I am trying to get some more of the OE VW units from my importer but do not know what the new cost will be . I have never tried 
to get the vac cans only but can also look into that. I can also check and see how many NOS single vac cans I have, I am out of NOS duel vac 
cans.

&gt;Agreed.  Only $30 more for genuine Bosch than the Chinese non-brand
&gt;of Bruck Germany?
