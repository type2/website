Subject: Odd Valvetrain Combo

Hello all, have been lurking about and reading the list from the e-groups 
site, and with the aquisition of a 78 westy last week, I thought I'd join up. 
I've a question that some of you with more experience can hopefully answer 
for me. When I purchased the bus, I noticed quite a bit of &quot;clattering&quot; noise 
from the valve/rocker area on both banks of the engine. Figured that the 
valves were just loose and would adjust to spec. when I got it home. When I 
removed the valve covers, I found the following: The engine has been fitted 
with solid lifters and the related push-rods, however, the rocker arms and 
valve springs are of the hydrolic lifter variety. As I was also planning to 
replace the push-rod tubes and seals, I took a moment to spec the cam using 
my dial indicator. If my cam information is to be believed, it would appear 
that the cam is of the hydrolic family. I then reassembled the whole mess, 
setting my exhaust cleareance to.007, and intake to .004, as I was accustom 
to doing with my previous upright engines. I then checked compression, which 
was between 135-145psi on all cyls, followed by a leak down test that showed 
less than 10% leakage from all cyls. The engine runs extreamly well, has 
plenty of power all the way up to 4500rpm, but the damned valvetrain noise is 
making me rather starkers. My question is this; can I assume that reverting 
to the stock hydrolic lifters is kosher, or  was this modification to solid 
lifters done for some purpose that I am unaware of. Oh yes, the engine #'s, 
on both the fan housing and the case confirm that this indeed is a 1978 model.
Thank you, Stralin Davitch
