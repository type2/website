Subject: Looking for help

Hey guys and gals I am looking for a cancer free bug. It does not need an engine and can need mechanical work. The more complete the better and the lower the price the better. If you know of any around you that are for sale please p-mail me.  My club the Omaha Volkswagen Club is looking for a car to raffle of at this summers show so any help would be appreciated.  currently both my busses are sleeping soundly through all the midwest snow.  Thanks

Wade Rodman
