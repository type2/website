A quick Google search turns up:

http://www.kanter_dot_com/p66-tire.html
http://www.gtw_dot_com.au/products/tyres_mid.htm
http://www.kelseytire_dot_com/tirechart.htm

Yes, they are still out there.  These mostly look like passenger tires but
one site does mention that theirs are truck tires, so they may have an
adequate load carrying capaciy.  Remember that you need a load rating of
at least 95 on bus tires.

                             OOK!
