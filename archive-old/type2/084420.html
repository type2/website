Subject: [T2] important sunroof qestion!! -please help

--part1_3d.1dd447aa.2a0857ff_boundary

hey all, 
 i have a 78 champagne edition bus with a 4ft sunroof which when i tried 
operating the sunroof started to open 3 or 4 inches when the headliner/liner 
part stayed but the sunroof part kept opening 3 more inches. when opening te 
sunroof, i kept feeling like the gear was slipping from the crank mechanism. 
at that point i decided to close it. as i was shuttin it it closed a little 
but but kept on kind of stripping. at that point it wouldnt close anymore. 
its about a couple of inches open right now. we were able to re-attach the 
headliner part to the sunroof. but its still about 3 inches open and wont 
close. i guesse my question is what should i do? it seems like the mechanism 
was starting to slip. what parts do i need? im kind of going crazy here, if 
anybody has or knows anybody with parts that i need, or any information. i 
live on long island, if anybody knows anybody i can go too. ive been to gene 
(if anybody knows him) and said he can fix it but has no parts. well im 
desprate for help. thanks so much and ill talk to all of you later., see ya
-Matt
