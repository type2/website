Subject: headrests for a 75?
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL - S

does anyone know if the original seats for a '75 came
with headrests? none of my seats do but they look like
they have holes where they would go. are these
compatible with other sets of headrests (ie. other vw
camper's and vanagon's)?just wondering about the
whiplash factor...

have a nice day,
tesa
