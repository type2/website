Subject: VW bus model kit

   Do you have any idea where I might get a model kit of a VW 
   bus?  My 13-year old daughter has fallen in love with them 
   and she's a bit young for the real thing.  The local hobby 
   and toy stores don't have any.  Please post response directly to me at
   Robin_Schectman_at_unc_dot_edu.  Thanks.
