Scott,  I found this very interesting and sounds like a deal compared to J.C. Whitney.  I found a web site selling the Attwood Turbo fans for $17.95.   Thanks.  I do have on question.  I can't find any information on the Detmar.  Is it a product of Attwood?  Is that the manufacturer name? I'd like to live in a heated wind tunnel.
