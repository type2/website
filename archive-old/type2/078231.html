Subject: Re: [T2] speedo lube

F.W., list:
Now that I'm working on my 80 westy, I need to fix the odometer. I need the
little black drive gear. apparently they all crack, as I've seen several cracked
ones and no good ones in junkyard speedos. I believe that Wurth Products or some
other supplier may have these available.
Lacking that has anyone any experience with speedo repair shops? Palo Alto
speedometer is the only name I've heard. Has anyone used them?

Having gone that far though, you might as well rebuild

&gt; the speedo, could be whale oil for all I know.
