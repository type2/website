&gt; The GEX surprise is...  I emailed the President of GEX about my
engine's 
&gt; self-destruct after only 28,000 well-cared for miles and he agreed to 
&gt; replace the destroyed parts and/or take the engine back for
repair!!!!!  
&gt; I haven't done anything about this yet since I've been busy, and I'm
not 
&gt; yet sure what I'll do, but after all the GEX-bashing that's gone on
I was 
&gt; surprised, to say the least, at GEX's response.

Very generous of them.  I wonder if they are willing to pay for your
time in removing/replacing the engine, for the shipping back and
forth, and for the time when you can't use your bus?

If they just replace the bad parts they are getting off cheap for
their shoddy work.
