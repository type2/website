The easiest engine to pull and install was in my 66: bumper &amp; apron, unplug the wires, disconnect the gas cable and fuel
line,    take off the four bolts and lower engine back and down. about 20 minutes. Installation about twice as long. Of
course
this lends itself to doing jobs on the side of the thruway, because it becomes cheaper and psychologically more bearable
than a tow.

   Then the 68-71 bus take a bit longer. now you have the additional loosening/removing of 4 more bolts on the rear
support.
Installation is a bit trickier too because you have to coordinate the rear support with the engine carrier
installation time after learning the idiosyncracies of your bumper bolts: about 30 minutes removal and 45 installation.

    The 72 isn't much more difficult, you may want to remove the rear tin to give yourself some clearance, because the
rear
apron no longer comes off. Also by now you should have a good strong $95 floor jack of 2.25 tons or so and a nice flat
board that will ride in between that and the oil sump, so you can pivot the motor as you remove it.
Once the motor is on the jack and the jack is lowered to the ground, I lay on my back and lift the motor by one end of
the rear
support, reach across with the other hand and pull the floor jack out from under the motor. Then drag the motor out from
under
the bus. removal time after practice? about 45 min.  installation time after practice? a good hour.

 I Always remove and install the motor by itself, not as a unit with the tranny, because that's the way I learned it.
Good luck
