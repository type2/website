Subject: 009 DISTRIBUTOR ADVANCE

The following information was gleaned from the June '92 issue of DB &amp; HVW's.

Approximate total advance German 009 at approximately 2250 RPM is 24 degrees

Approximate total advance Brazilian 009 at approximately 2600 RPM is 21 degrees

German 009's are marked &quot;GERMANY&quot; on the bottom of the distributor. Brazilians
are much more common than German.
