Subject: Test for a worn bushing?

Hello all,

I'm trying to decide whether to take the freshly rebuilt starter BACK to
the rebuilder, who is still open on a late Sunday afternoon, and tell them
,&quot; HEY, the starter isn't working&quot;.

                          OR

Locate and install a new bushing first.

Is there a bushing only test?  Bentley/Haynes mention nothing of it.

Thanks, Craig w/1981 Van, manual
