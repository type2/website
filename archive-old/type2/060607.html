Subject: Should I buy a camper connversion?

Hey, this weekend I looked at a '78 camper conversion (the owner says it 
was done by Winnebego) Its got a pop-top, sink, closet, propane tank, 
but the stove and sink are missing. The closet and table are ugly wood 
grain colored. I suppose some contact paper would fix this.
(any better ideas?) Overall its not as nice as a Westy. Has anybody had 
any experience with conversions? I'm looking for any advice. Wheter its 
worth a little work or is a Westy the way to go? Also
what kind of stove was in this. There is a tank under the sliding door
and a hookup and electrical outlet behind the front passenger seat.
(where the sink, ice-box is on my '72 Westy) Now there is just an empty 
space there. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!
                                                               Simon
