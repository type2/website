Subject: Re: [T2] Zero ohm distributor rotors

&gt; Since I am running an MSD CDI ignition I need to use a zero ohm rotor.
&gt; Stock is either 1K or 5K, which will apparently burn out with the MSD.
&gt; Alternatives were to modify an existing one, or buy an altered one from
&gt; aircooled_dot_net.
&gt;
&gt; Much to my surprise the cheap aftermarket ones I found are zero ohm, and
&gt; therefore not to spec!  Niehoff WA307 (narrow nose) or WA315 (wide nose)
&gt; are two examples (...and made in the USA). I bought another cheap one
&gt; which crossed to the Niehoff WA315 # and same thing.
&gt; Moral:  Buy Bosch for 'to-spec' parts, buy no name if you NEED the
&gt; manufacturing cheap-out shortcut!

They are easy to modify.
Using a dremel with a mill end grind out epoxy and resistor.
Solder in wire.
Refill with epoxy.

there is a webpage somewhere with pictures and instuctions.
