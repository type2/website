Subject: 83 Westy engine identification and extra books

 
&gt;However, when I go to the parts store, they ask me if I have a 1.9L &gt;or a 2L.

The 1.9 is the 83.5 waterpumper if I'm correct. The vanagon became watercooled halfway thruough 1983.

&gt;Is there a book that has a
&gt;more specific slant toward the engine that I have?

Bentley Publishers for the offical VW service manual.  

&gt;Finally, where would be the best place to get a hotter
&gt;bosch coil, the sites recommended don't offer the
&gt;hotter red and black coil.

Run what's specified by the Bentley as stock. You'll be happiest. Welcome Andrew, this list is a great resource, I know cuz I started as a total newbie. Believe in what you're told here and you'll come out all right. I'm not one of the experts, but you'll figure out who they are, and I regurgitate their wisdom. It's worked for me.

Billy
