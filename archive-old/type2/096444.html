Subject: Re: [T2]  FI Confusion

Chuck,

Wasn't me that said it....


I can't imagine how *any* vacum lea....wups...just realized how.

THe only way that I can think of that a vacum leak might make you run 
rich is this...and it's really a reach.....

The vacuum hose to the pressure regulator would have a leak...this might 
make the pressure regulator believe that it was seeing  not much 
vacuum(like wide open throttle) and boost the pressure in the fuel ring a 
little.

Don't know if the  vacuum leak would make up for any difference in the 
fuel ring pressure added &quot;richness&quot; though.  They might actually balance 
out.

Cheers, dave

&gt; David and List,
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for your time.
&gt; 
&gt; I am having some confusion regarding L-Jetronic FI system related issues on 
&gt; the list.
&gt; 
&gt; I found that running lean air/fuel ratios was deadly for my 77 bus. It cost 
&gt; me $2500 and a lot of work.
&gt; 
&gt; Since that time I have made an effort to understand how FI works on my bus. 
&gt; I have collected literature and test equipment along with a extra 77 bus FI 
&gt; system and am assembling a mock-up of the 77 FI system.
&gt; 
&gt; Along the way I developed a simple theoretical math model of the 
&gt; relationship of the air and fuel manifold pressures in the open and closed 
&gt; 77 system. I plan a series of tests to compare the model with the real 
&gt; world.
&gt; 
&gt; When I run across statements in conflict with the current version of the 
&gt; model, I am very interested.
&gt; 
&gt; Lately someone on the list made the statement that certain vacuum leaks 
&gt; could cause a rich air/fuel condition. I don't understand how that could 
&gt; happen. If you have an understanding of this please let me know.
&gt; 
&gt; If I misunderstood and no one supports that statement fine. Otherwise
&gt; I am keen to learn more.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Chuck
