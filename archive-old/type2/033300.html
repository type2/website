Subject: Re: Vacuum Leak

Ron:
Got the same sound on my '79 FI bus.  I also noticed it immediately after
installing my AVP rebuild a year back.  Prior to install, I replaced every
scrap of vacuum line with new, correctly sized material, including intake
manifold boots.  Started up, ran perfectly but heard a hiss at the air box.
Spent an afternoon with mirrors, stethoscope, propane (does that really
work anyway???) etc, digging around and could not find any leak.  I
resolved that it just must be the sound of air moving past the throttle
body and into the air box.  The bus runs strong and cool, so I don't think
its a problem.
