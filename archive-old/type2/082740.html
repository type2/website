Subject: RE: [T2] Oils

Very interesting page on how the quickylube
places sell oil with no additives whatsoever:

http://www.synlube_dot_com/apisaoil.htm

Also found some info:

GF-3, API SL oils have and will receive plenty of
attention, much of it through oil company
advertising, but a less well known fact about the
new standard is that it may be one of the
shortest lived in the series. That's due
primarily to the need to cut phosphorus compounds
from the formulations in order to prevent
poisoning of the catalyst beds in catalytic
converters, a problem that promises to become
serious as EPA and California standards for
emission system durability put added pressure on
OEM's. With tougher emission standards scheduled
for 2004, look for GF-4 to arrive in time for the
2004 model year vehicles. GF-4 will be attainable
despite the short timeline. Ford and Honda's
5W-20 oil specifications, for example, already
exceed GF-3 standards for oxidation stability,
and some manufacturers are demanding deposit
control standards that also go beyond the current
requirement. Of course, synthetics are an easy
route to better properties, but with the
exception of a few high-performance models,
manufacturers have balked at the cost....

Phosphorus, actually some form of zinc phosphate,
is very important in limiting friction in your
engine.
