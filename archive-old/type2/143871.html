Subject: [T2]Door locks question

following the door locks subject that was brought up  i tried it myself having the problems of sticking door locks...
my passenger and drivers locks were almost to the point of key breaking when trying with key.
I have gotten use to just opening the slide door and then reaching through and opening the passenger lock or crawling through being the sldiing door as a entrance shutting it behind me and then crawling into the drivers seat from there.
Not a major problem but rather have drivers door (lock) at least fixed.
 
so read what you all suggested and shot a squirt of some carb cleaner and also used some pb blaster as well...
success i can now open my door locks with the key once again hoo ray no more post dukes of hazard stuff.    LOL....
 
Thanks for the info as always was very helpful......
makes a difference shame must lock doors but some places are better than others......
always when going into town......
 
Chris


Peace and Love
Chris
