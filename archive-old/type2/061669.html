&gt; Hey Volks-
&gt; I have a '73 Westy in my garage, that I'm attempting to put on the
&gt; road.

&gt; First- On the #1&amp;2 head(as I remember... car isn't in front of me)
&gt; there are two long studs that come out on either side of the intake
&gt; manifold, they appear to be some sort of ports or something..... what
&gt; are they?????
Kent:
I think those are the remains of the smog pump tubes-they go thru the
heads into the exhaust ports. Why you don't have similar ones on the 3-4
side is a question, maybe they are plugged. I've removed these fittings
and plugged the holes with rocker arm adjusting screws. It's necessary
that they be plugged because you will have exhaust gas leaking
otherwise.
