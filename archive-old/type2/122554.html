&gt; Does anyone know the size helicoil I would need to replace the stock size

Snoopy,

Don't use helicoils in that location, it is a waste of time. They will pull
out. Use solid inserts, there a few types, I feel that &quot;Time Serts&quot; are the
best for head stud repair. I have repaired lots of damaged head studs with
Time Serts and they are bulletproof. I have a pile of core heads on the
shelf and in the ones that have helicoils in the exhaust studs, the inserts
are trashed. 

Time sert has a good website, www.timesert_dot_com.

To answer your size question, it depends on the heads you have. Early T4
heads have exhaust studs that are 8 x 1.25 on both ends, later ones have 8 x
9mm. The VW dealer still sells these, and they are the only ones I would
recommend using, aftermarket exhaust studs are crap, too soft and the
threads are not formed properly. We sell both sizes of studs (OG VW), and
the Time Sert kits.
