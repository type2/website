Subject: Re: [T2] EMPI muffler installation

From: &quot;Dr Andrea Berardelli&quot; &lt;doctorb_at_imag_dot_net&gt;
&gt; I use that muffler and it is fine, although the paint will came off in 3
hours.

Figured that might happen.

&gt; You got it all right and I too have concerns about that hose clamp
arrangement.  It has been like that on my van for a month now without any
ill effect but I will go back and install a rubber muffler strap U clamped
to the tail pipe end and the bumper mounting bolt, soon.

I'll drill out that slot at one end so I can slide a bolt head into it,
then.

&gt; I think all in all it is good value of the money.

Yes, $39.00 is a good price.

&gt; Good luck...

Thank you. :O)
