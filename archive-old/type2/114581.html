Subject: Hall electronic ignition

Who has experience with electronic ignition on the air cooled vanagons? I have
questions about locating TDC. When I tried yesterday I would have had to turn
the distrubutor 180 degrees from where I know it should be in order to line up
the notch on the distributor with TDC based on the fan notch. That's not
right. I need help, please.
