&gt; some years ago when I built a kit car, when finished I had to take it to a
&gt; shop with a lift and a State Trooper from the auto inspection unit spent
&gt; two days going over the thing with a fine tooth comb. when I fixed the
&gt; problems identified, I was issued a metal plate about 2X4 inches with an
&gt; engraved number on it and told I had to permanently affix it to the frame.
&gt; 
&gt; then I was issued a title and inspection certificate so I could register
&gt; the car.   was a quite complex prochedure

Hello Guys  If you do it this way in the state of Virginia you have opened a 
real can of worms .  The rail buggy would have to have all the things a 2004 
car does(Airbags, defrost ETC)    Most people here use the old bug pan with the 
old bug numbers. heck if it is before 1969 it doesnt even have to have a 
windshield but it is supose to have wipers Go figure  but it is called the 
communistwealth of Virginia. Later and have fun  Mark Dearing
