&gt; Well I always say it is, shame some pansy types don't think so.
&gt; FWIW I don't know how awesome $150 for a FI setup was, I mean
&gt; I guess but you could have done it from the right pick and pull for
&gt; $20 or so.  Still if it all works that is fair for what you got.

For every &quot;awesome&quot; story, there seems to be a &quot;ripoff&quot; story, which 
is why *bay posts aren't welcome on the type 2 list.  Better to deal 
with people you know here.  If you want to gamble, go right ahead, but 
don't drag the list into it.
