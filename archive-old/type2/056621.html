Subject: Re: hot start quick fix

I would speculate that it might be a slow leak (most likely internal) in the 
fuel system.  When the engine's cold, the cold start valve will give a 
shot of gas (even with very low residual pressure) that get's things 
going.  When the engine's still very warm, that means only a short time 
has passed since it was running, and you still have enough residual 
pressure in the system.  It's that &quot;in between&quot; stage that's the problem; 
cold start valve is too warm to kick in, but you've lost most of the 
internal pressure in the system because the engine's sat for awhile.

You might want to test the system's fuel pressure.

&gt; If engine is cold, it kicks right over.
&gt; 
&gt; If engine is at normal operating temp (N.O.T.), it kicks right over.
&gt; 
&gt; If engine was at N.O.T., but has been cooling an hour or so, crank,
&gt; crank, crank, no fire.  Really makes going shopping interesting.  If
&gt; I let it sit for four hours after N.O.T., it kicks right over.
&gt; 
&gt; It's that one-hour cool-down, where the engine is at some intermediate
&gt; temperature, that seems to be the problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone got any ideas?  I'm thinking Temp Sensor II is showing age,
&gt; maybe its resistance curve is off--min and max values are OK, but
&gt; intermediate values occur at wrong time during warm up.  Is that a
&gt; known problem with those NTC sensors as they get older?  Anything
&gt; else it could be?
