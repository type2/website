BTW - EVERYBODY USING MS SOFTWARE for use on the internet, PLEASE turn on
your word wrap and set it at about 75 or so...you screw up every other

I had the answer to and went to respond and hit answer and got the whole
#_at_$#* come up as one long line, and just said to heck with it and hit
delete is now reaching several a day

MS is bound and determined to drive everyother software program into
oblivion by setting their defaults to scramble other software.  before I
change my software I will drop off the list (sort of like driving my BUS)

Friday Rant,  OFF

wishing everyone a happy Easter, passover, bunny egg day or every other
holiday celebrating Spring!!

&gt; I have a 77 deluxe westy. Tonight I went to a baseball game and left the refer running on battery for about 4 hours. The battery monitor shows its is fully charged before I left the bus. When I returned I could not start the bus. I have the factory two battery set up, so I thought the main battery was isolated and would not drain with the &quot;RV&quot; battery. 
&gt; 
&gt; I tried switching from one to two and also to both, same result. 
&gt; 
&gt; Are my batteries weak, or are they somehow connected and not isolated?
&gt; 
&gt; You ideas would be appreciated. The camper battery is a deep cycle.
&gt; 
&gt; thanks
