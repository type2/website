&gt;Without re-opening debates on offsets, load capabilities, and all that

&gt;
&gt;Which cars and trucks and vans share the same wheel bolt patterns with the 
&gt;later model Baywindow busses?
&gt;

 Mercedes. Audi. Opel Omega and later busses, even year 1999 model busses.
I have seen theese with very cool looking aluminum wheels.

&gt;And for you Beetle/Ghia/Type III folks - any cars that shared the 4 bolt 
&gt;pattern?

 I know only one car manufacturer using the same four bolt pattern as VW:
Skoda (made in Checkoslowakia) The rear engine models came with 13 and 14
inch wheels depending on wich year they vere made. Anyway, forget getting
wide Skoda wheels, think they were 4 1/2 inch at the best. Mabye a bit rare
in the USA too ;-)
