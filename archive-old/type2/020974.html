&gt; Hey fellow listees!  Before I start my tale of Bus woe, let me say that
&gt; Everybus was just the best; the weather and the people couldn't have
&gt; been nicer, and I even got a bunch of cool artwork done on my bus for
&gt; free by Danielle and Abi, thanks so much!  Ok, here is the problem.  My
&gt; 78 bus has the original factory a/c, which worked fine last summer until
&gt; the belt broke.  I have the bus in the shop right now getting some
&gt; engine seals replaced and I had asked them to please put on a new belt.
&gt; The owner of the shop calls me yesterday and tells me that in order to
&gt; put a new belt on he basically has to rip the whole engine apart and it
&gt; will take something like 30 hours of labor and cost LOTS of money and
&gt; that he is not doing it.  My question is: is replacing this belt really
&gt; that hard?

Beth:
No, not that hard at all. Basically, you just have to remove the oil filter,
loosen the compressor, and remove the fan. (loosen the alternator, remove the
alternator belt, remove the 3 bolts that secure the fan to the hub, wiggle
the fan out the back.) Figuring out the right belt size Might be a problem,
(just looked at the info sheet for the VPC that was in my 78, it says ZVW 219
222)
BTW, I have ALL the literature and templates that came with my VPC air
conditioner. I installed it myself back in about 1984.
I'd  be alittle concerned about this mechanics abilities if he thinks this is
a big job.
There may be many other things wrong with this system, but the belt is the
easy part.
