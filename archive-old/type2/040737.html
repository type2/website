Subject: Re: Trolley Jack

Well, every one tells me that the big jacks are the ones to go for.
That's what I expected, I suppose.   
It also means that it'll have to wait - until I've got some spare bread.
Of course, there's one good thing about owning a 1970 bus....

The removable rear valance.  ;-)

So in any event I don't nead to lift the thing as high.

Thanks folks
