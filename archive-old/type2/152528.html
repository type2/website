Subject: Oil pump gear length ?

How is an oil pump gear length identified ? The gears that came out of my
'71 dual relief AE case have the following dimensions:
diameter : ~38mm, depth (measures length or gear running parallel to it's
shaft) : 21mm

Wilson says &quot;Oil pumps are measured by the length of their gear&quot;.
40HP thru 67 : 17mm
68-69 : 19mm
70 only : 24mm
71 : 26 mm

So I should measure 26 mm ? Where am I supposed to measure 26mm length ?

That oil pump in my engine may be original, it seems worn as the backlash is
between 0.014 ' and 0.010' depending on the gears checked. Wilson again says
backlash should be &lt;0.008' and prefferably &lt; 0.004'.

I will replace it, possibly with a pump/filter combo but need to know what
to shop for.
