Subject: screen window track fix
Message-ID: &lt;GPPGIDJCOAPFCAAA_at_theglobe_dot_com&gt;

My '72 Riviera has the sliding windows like later bay buses do; this was standard for Rivieras, I believe. The plastic track for the screen portion of this sliding window has largely disintegrated. What I did to resolve this problem was melt some glue chips (similar in composition to hot glue sticks, I believe, though from the smell I believe they contain parifin as well). I then poured this hot glue into the track.

So far so good. The screen now slides smoothly on top of the now-hardened glue. If anyone else needs to do this, I've got plenty of these glue chips. I can probably hook a couple or three of you up with what you need.

Thanks! Joe
