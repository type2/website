Here are pictures of the hitch from my 71 doublecab.

http://www.screaming_dot_com/truck_hitch

The PO claimed &quot;original VW part&quot; but it looks pretty generic to me.
It's made of 3&quot; angle iron and some flat stock.  All the steel is 1/4&quot;
thick.  It bolts to the outside of the frame rails.  There are three
threaded holes in the frame rails on each side that appear to be
stock.  Some of the angle iron is ground away to clear the headers.

&gt; Hi folks,
&gt;    I'd like to be able to tow a small trailer with our 71 westy.  What does 
&gt; a trailer hitch for an early bay look like?  A verbal desciption would be 
&gt; great, a scetch even better, and a hitch to sell to me would be great.  I'm 
&gt; just looking to tow a small trailer to carry some bicycles.  Since the bikes 
&gt; are tandems a regular type of bike rack is out.
