Subject: [T2] Steering Gear Lube

Hi,
Its the same lube you use for the manual transmission, 85W90 Gear
Oil GL4. When i filled mine up it was pretty empty and i think it took
around 1 quart. Also just fill till the fluid just covers the inner 
metal lip don't over fill.  To make filling simpler i used the STA-Lube
fluid pump that i bought for adding fluid to the transmission, works 
great for the steering box too. Bought it at the local FLAPS for 
about $10.

Here are some photos of where the fill plug is located on top of the 
steering box and the pump I used. Make sure you clean well around
the plug before you remove it, else a lot of crud will fall in when
you pry it off.
