Come on, come on, tell us, tell us.  Does the key FIT anything on the
bus?  We're just dying to know, or it's Friday, I can never tell!

I would rather you vote against me than not vote at all.
Get out and VOTE on November 5th (USA folks that is !)

&gt; While replacing one of the large heater air hoses underneath my
&gt; '79 bus, a key with a metal tag attached to it dropped onto the
&gt; driveway.
&gt;
&gt; I suppose that the dealer, or more likely, the factory, hid this
&gt; key and metal tag there.
