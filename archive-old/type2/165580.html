&gt; Terry,

&gt; What is the availability of Halon refilling as of today?  I have a few old
&gt; refillable Halon extinguishers that probably need to be R&amp;R'ed by now.  Any
&gt; ideas?  It was my understanding that you could take them to your local fire
&gt; station to get them checked and refilled, but that could've been an urban
&gt; myth.

Since they aren't making Halon any more, the pricy thing about getting it
is the halon itself.

The big selling point about Halon is that it doesn't
deteriorate like dry chemical fire extinguishers.  As long as the cylinder
is the proper weight and has the proper pressure it should work fine.
