Message-ID: &lt;3759E9F1.374301AD_at_mail.ripon.k12.wi_dot_us&gt;

hey...
I have a leak in my brake fluid resevoir behind the drivers seat of a 71
hardtop westy.... How can I go about fixing this?? Do I need a new one?
or is there some sort of magic fix that I can use...??

help me out...I get a puddle of brake fluid where the hose goes into the
floor after about a week after I fill it....
