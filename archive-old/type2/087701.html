&gt; Welded cage? as in welded it to both the tranny linkage and the rod
&gt; linkage????  *bad, bad* PO!
&gt;

Yeah wild eh? No, it appears the weld is on the square bolt and the cage. The 
linkage on the tranny side appears clean.

&gt; If both sides and ya gotta pull the tranny to fix the circlip, then
&gt; unscrew the pin in the center of the cage and take the tranny out to work
&gt; on it...much easier than metal fillings in the eye.
&gt;

Ok sounds like a party. So thats one vote keep and repair.

&gt; Then you can pull the shift rod linkage and R&amp;R it also.
&gt;
&gt; Goo on the trans is pretty much standard.....
&gt;
&gt; Never would have believed that the shaft was coming out.....amazing!
&gt;
&gt; Cheers, dave

Thanks Dave,
