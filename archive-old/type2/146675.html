Subject: Re: [T2] Vehicle Weight and Tires

Without published data from the tire manufacture, you can get close with 
this:

actual (or max. expected) gross tire weight (or half the axle weight) / 
max. tire weight rating * tire max. inflation

In this case:

front   1399 / 1710 * 65 = 53
rear   1240 / 1710 * 65 = 47


Two questions:

What year is your van, Jamie? A quick glance at my '79 owner's manual 
shows a GVWR between 4960 (station wagon) and 5070 (kombi and delivery 
van). Looks like you may be outside that.

Why do you have so much weight in the front? Or are the numbers reversed?

&gt;
&gt;I had the chance to weigh my camper recently, so here is some info...
&gt;  
&gt;
&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;Scale Weight on Front:  2788 lbs......1399 lbs on each tire Scale Weight on
&gt;Back :  2480 lbs......1240 lbs on each tire Total weight  5268 lbs
&gt;
&gt;Tires:
&gt;
&gt;Yokohama LT195/75R14  Load range &quot;D&quot;   M&amp;S
&gt;
&gt;1710 lbs max _at_ 65 psi
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;So,, if I did the math right,, I should put 48 psi in the rear tires.. and
&gt;40 in the front tires when I have this much load in the camper....
