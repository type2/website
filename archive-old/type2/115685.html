&gt; I just ordered a hatch seal for my split. supposedly they are the
&gt; same seal. When it gets here I'l compare &amp; snap some pics of how the
&gt; fit/finish is, if you would like. These are from wolfburgwest

Of all the seals I'm come across the engine lid seal seems to have the worst
reproductions:

The original part number was 211 827 711C for 72-79 bus. 711 was for the
68-71 bus as the lip or the seal changed.

1. OEVeedub sells a 68-71 German seal 211 827 711 from Just Kampers as a
68-79 seal. It's on the right in the photo. 1-piece. It won't fit the late
bus.

2. Wolfsburg west sells a 68-71 seal 211 827 711 as 55-79. It comes in 4
Pieces and doesn't fit either. I suspect if you glue it in place it won't
seal as well as the original.

3. WCM sells two seals: one 68-71 seal 261-711 and 72-79 seal 261-711C. I
saw pictures of these over at BugHaus:

http://www.bughaus_dot_com/engine_door_seal_-_261-711.htm
http://www.bughaus_dot_com/engine_door_seal_-_261-711C.htm

Has anyone bought the 261-711C seal from WCM or BugHaus. From all my
research (it shouldn't have to be this hard) this one looks like the best
fit although you still have 4-pieces to glue.

4. Bus Depot lists both 68-71 and 72-79 seals (UK source seals from Just
Kampers I believe) and I wonder if they are different. Has anyone bought the
711C seal lately? The website says they are 1-piece so it's at least
different than the WCM seal.

This is the last seal I need for my bus and I'd appreciate any feedback.
