Subject: RE: [T2] Cleaning the oil breather hose

So, I recently hooked my thermostat back up while the alternator was out and
I had to push the arm all the way forward for enough of the cable to grab
when tightening down on it.  Is this not the correct method for hooking up
the cable?  I have not tested after the engine is warm since I have not had
a chance to deal with the alternator cooling boot issue yet. I'm perusing
the archives at this time but no luck so far.

Can you push the arm forward or is it all the way forward when cold?
