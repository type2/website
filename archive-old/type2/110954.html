&gt; 	What everybody said.  I got turned on to FRS by the Mexican VW club
&gt; I was invited to join two years or so ago.  As everyone knows, CB radio is
&gt; illegal as all get out in Mexico, so the club all packs FRS as means of
&gt; keeping in touch on road trips, and club events...

CB is illegal and FRS isn't?  Mexico is a funny country...  They do have
reciprocal licenses for hams who want to operate south 'o the border.

&gt; 	My first rite of initiation to the club (German Toys - VW's Friends
&gt; Mexicali) was to buy a set of FRS radios...

&gt; 	The second rite was to show them all how to reinstall engine
&gt; compartment seals...

&gt; 	The last and best rite was that I have to marry the sister of one of
&gt; the club's founding members,

Dang, tough club.  I'd join, but my current spouse might object!

&gt; and attend the club's functions as the resident
&gt; North American affiliate...  Boy let me tell you, they do take membership
&gt; seriously, but what privileges ;-)  And besides, she comes with her very own
&gt; Karmann Ghia, and is VERY partial to bus pilots.

I know what you mean.  My wife came with a squareback and bug.

&gt; 	Where was I?  Oh, yes - FRS radios.  For bus-a-van use, find ones
&gt; that will also use the headset and have PTT/VOX (push to talk / voice
&gt; activation) operation - I got a couple package deals on pairs - Midland
&gt; brand - SpeakEasy(??).  The headset allows you to literally keep an ear in
&gt; on things on tours.  Without the headset, you'll be constantly having to ask
&gt; people to repeat things.  I like the PTT function - a lot of times
&gt; extraneous cabin noise will trigger the mike if set to VOX operation.  This
&gt; wears out other people's batteries (and patience) unnecessarily.

Boy do I know that!  [Click, scrritch, breath, breath, hummmmmm to the
radio, breath, scriitch, breath, click]  (repeat hundreds of times)

Kinda makes me want to go out and kill something...  :)

&gt; 	3 other things - you can out-kewl fast food clerks by wearing your
&gt; FRS + headset indoors - &quot;Look Ma, another radio-controlled human!&quot;  Show up
&gt; at VW events and people start coming up to you and asking questions, because
&gt; they think you look important with your radio, and therefore you must be
&gt; somehow involved.  And finally - you'll gain a better appreciation for those
&gt; who hear voices, because you too, have just joined their ranks!

Jim, you aren't just a geek, you're the King Geek!
