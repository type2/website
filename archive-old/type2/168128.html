&gt; Going to the first site that came up on doing a google search on &quot;finned
&gt; tubing&quot;, this site http://www.fintube_dot_com/ has some really interesting stuff
&gt; that may work quite well. Also, you may be able to find the finned tubing in
&gt; some kind of salvage industrial heat exchanger. If it is steel, you can weld
&gt; it into rows with weldable u-bend steam pipe fittings available at any good
&gt; plumbing supply store or sweat solder copper fittings if it is copper
&gt; tubing.

   The only caveat I have with any of this is just how much you're gonna
   stress/overstress the water pump...The pump was designed to work
   in conjunction with the normal thermosyphoning of the radiator and I'd
   be leery of just how much you can &quot;push&quot; the stock water pump... ?-(
