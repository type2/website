Subject: Re: [T2] Difference in fuel pumps for upright engines

Hello All  There are two types of fuel pumps ,gen.  and alt.    The alt style 
uses shorter push rod and is bent to clear the alt. THE GEN. STYLE IS MORE 
UPRIGHT AND USES A PUSH ROD 13MM LONGER .  You can put the alt style on the 
gen motor by changing the pushrod  . The gen style will work on the alt but 
it is a bear to get in or off.       Mark Dearing  Salem Import service  
Salem va.   PS    You can tell  one from the other by how far the push lever 
hangs below the pump, the alt style will stick below the bottom of the pump 
and the gen. style is recessed up in the pump.
