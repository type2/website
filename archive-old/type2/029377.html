There have been a few poor student types griping
on the list about getting puddles in the rear
of their vans when it rains.

My solution (I'm not poor, just a cheapskate)
was to get a 'garage door bottom weatherstripping'
seal from Homer D. Poe. It is soft closed cell foam.
One doors worth will do the side and back. Cut the back
to go one inch past each corner, it will shrink a little
in a week or so.

I just hang mine in place each time I close the hatch.
When I open it, it falls onto the rain gutter
above the door, ready for the next use. Slow, yes,
but cheap, like $10. I did the same thing on the side
door, but used some double sided tape to hold it in there.

I am doing bodywork right now, and will cry into my
beer when I cough up the dough to get real seals, but
the garage door seal works fine until then.
