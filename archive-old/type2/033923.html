Nice post.

There is another option probably already mentioned. Put in a stop order,
request a refund and buy your product somewhere else. I saw the web site and
it looks as though she has everything hand made going by all the color
combinations she's willing to provide.

An axiom, or truth, that I learned is &quot;You can make plans but you can't plan
results&quot; always explains why my expectations weren't met.

Another model of behavior I like is a guy I saw on Candid Camera. When asked
why he didn't get mad when his changed wasn't returned from a purchase ( a new
store policy to round up ) the guy,
a young rugged looking New Yorker type responded &quot; Nobody rents space in MY
head !&quot;.

Nobody knows. Everybody may have lost their money. Either wait it out or
cancel and buy elsewhere.
Start the refund process. Get one or don't get one.

If she is in crisis then she sounds like a human and not a corporation
although big business isn't exempt from failure either.

gary in SF





&gt; let us consider the spirit of the season, there apppears to be some
&gt; contact from someone close to her,  I would say &quot;give her a break&quot;  what
&gt; she probably needs more than anything is someone to
&gt; send her a check for a job and a note saying &quot;I know you have problems
&gt; right now but I'm not in a hurry try getting it to me by summer at the
&gt; latest&quot;
