Subject: Re: [T2] finally picking up my engine from Boston Bob

I was kind of thinking the same thing. While it is unfortunate to do
business over distances with such high shipping costs, ultimately I
believe the only warranty obligation was for the customer to return
the engine to Bob and for Bob to fix it. His willingness to underwrite
part of the cost of local repair is, to me, an indication of Bob's
graciousness which seems to have gone unappreciated on Samba.

 As for warrenties it

 they dont pay. Boston Bob usually does a real good job, but he is only human
 so there will be mistakes.   As for the thread on the Samba it is the same
