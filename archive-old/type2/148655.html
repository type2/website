Subject: Re: [T2] Warning : What a bad clutch driven plate will do to
  your bus

OK--Here's the scoop.

&quot;VW's engines don't turn fast enough to worry about it &quot;

Was the basic consensus.

And a bunch of laughing.

&quot;Who worries about this kinda thing/&quot; or just &quot;Where in the hell do you
come up with this stuff TK?

Anyway, here is the answer's to the craziness.

If your buying cheap reman pressure plates &amp; disc, your getting what you
pay for.
The disc on the pressure plate could very well be on it's last ride and
the assembly itself could have been abused, dropped, or have the trans
shaft hanging out on the end of the PP and twisted it--

A new PP is staticly balanced from the factory.
So is the disc.

So does a reputable reman outfit, like Spicer /Dana for instance.

A racing clutch is balanced with the flywheel and disc--al in one piece.
Staticly.

When you have your flywheel cut it isn't rebalanced.
It really doesn't have to be because most of the mass is on the outside
of flywheel ,and that is balanced.
Only if a cob artist starts cutting the whell in a who know's how way,
should it be rebalanced.

Now let me say this one and I'm done with this wild subject--

I've personally replaced hundreds of Mack, and other off brand ctutches
in my time.
New and rebuilt.

The flywheel weighs about 90---100lbs
The disc maybe 5--6 lbs, and the PP maybe 30--40 lbs.

You would think with this big of a mass  spinning at the tail end of the
crankshaft, and on the input shaft of the trans, that any outa balance
situation would be very critical.

It isn't.

The flywheel is balanced once in it's life, and the PP is staticly
balanced when it's rebuilt ( if its a good clutch )

I have never had any kind of harmonic vibration outa any class 8
vehicle's clutch, be it reman or new, except one time the flywheel broke
at the hub and was just about to blow off the crank.

The guys with the Chevy's said--why?

The guys with the Mopar's said --What?

 My buddy Happy Snappy who races SCCA in a Rotary Mazda said--&quot;Terrence
your thinking way too much, take a nap&quot;

And the guy from Spicer wanted to know if the engines were running over
12 grand.
Then he'd be worried about MAYBE the PP having some harmonic problems.


I don't think any of you have to worry about any of this--as long as
your buying a new or quality reman pressure plate and disc.

Have Fun,
