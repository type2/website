Subject: RE: [T2] Old Key

I dropped the door handle for my keyless Deluxe off at a local locksmith, 
they are going to make a key for it. They estimate it will cost $20. Had 
never done this before but I'm giving it a shot. Why not go that route 
instead of replacing the locks?

Of course if I really wanted to be cool I would have gotten those nifty VW 
blanks like the originals.....but I'm not that cool.
