Well you may as well shoot it since you wrote &quot;IN TOW&quot; all over it with
spray paint and RUINED it. =^ )

&gt; Check out my newest member of my VW family. I kinda feel like one of the
&gt; animal shelters that rescue animals that have been abused. I just wonder if
&gt; I should shoot this one and put it out of is misery ?
