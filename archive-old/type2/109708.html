Subject: Re: [T2] Dizzy saga cont.

Mark,

     Eureka! Watched that #1 intake like you said, hooked everything back up, 
turned her over and it took a little bit but it fired up and smoked a bit but 
she smoothed out and purred, although I did forget to put the spring in 
between the drive shaft and the dizzy back in. That was with the 009 which I 
originally was trying to replace with the 205T toget rid of the dead spot. 
But now that I know for sure that is the correct procedure for finding TDC I 
can play with distributors all day long. I think the whole time I must have 
been putting the engine at BTC not to mention the fact I had my drive gear in 
backassward. Funny though the valves were tighter at BTC than at TDC is this 
a seriously bad thing? Later and thanks
