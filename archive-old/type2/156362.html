&gt; I suppose I need the conversion tins I posted about
&gt; earlier. Anybody know of a good cheap set?

If you want cheap and effective, you'll probably need
to take the lead from what you have. Find a sheet
metal shop in your area (an old established
heating/air conditioning company with their own
shop)Either use what you have as partial templates and
re-do the whole thing in like manner only better (buy
a set of sheet metal shears and two boxes of band
aids) Or add to what you have to seal better.

Meanwhile, keep looking for what you really want - the
right stuff! Of course you can easily burn up $200 of
time in doing a mediocre job. -BaH
