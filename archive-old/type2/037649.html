Clark,
If they are talking about the heat shield I think they are, it is on the type 4 
engine.  The piece I am thinking of installs directly above the muffler and 
between the inside engine tin.  It looks sort of like

Hope that helps.  I hope it is the same piece they were talking about.

&gt; Heat sheild?  I saw one of these in the busboys' catalog in the cooling tin
&gt; section for 68-79 trasnporters.
&gt; 
&gt; Is this part just on type1 busses?  I don't think we type4 people have
&gt; this,
&gt; or all mine have been missing...
