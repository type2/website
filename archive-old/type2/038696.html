Subject: Replacing Fuel Lines

Hello Everyone...I am going to tackle replacing all my fuel lines...Just 
looking for some helpful guidance with respect to this procedure...What type 
of line to use? Can I get the line at the local Flaps? How much line do I 
need? I have a 71 Campmobile...1600...If any one could shed some light for me 
I would appreciate it...Thanks again..Adam
