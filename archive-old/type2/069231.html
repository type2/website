Subject: SO-35 Chair accessory question

I was wondering if people could look at a pic. that Steve 
Mighetto sent me of his so-35 accessories and comment on the 
authenticity of the fold up chair? To me this looks more 
like a card table chair that the gennie westy chair.

No 'dis Steve just curious as to what I need to complete my 
own so-35 interior. I am considering selling my so-35 
interior if people are interested (has very hard to find 
front cargo door cabinet)

E-mail if you are interested. I am in Toronto, Canada.
