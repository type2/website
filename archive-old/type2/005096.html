Keep the soolid lift engine if it is solid, we see more problems with hydro
engines than solids...

&gt; Hello everyone,
&gt; It looks like I may soon be purchasing a 78 westy and parting with my
&gt; 76.  Before my 76, I had another 76 and I kept the engine and parts from
&gt; that one.  Now, I'm probably going to take the engine and tranny from
&gt; this one too.
&gt;
&gt; Since the three engines are not the same, what should I do?  The 78 is
&gt; hydraulic, one of the 76s is a rebuilt (17,000mi) with a full complete
&gt; working FI system, and the last 76 is the original engine from which I
&gt; stripped the working FI (~160,000mi).  Should I keep the 76 engines or
&gt; part with them?  I was thinking of keeping the rebuilt just in case the
&gt; 78 goes out and then I can swap while the other gets fixed.  Or, should
&gt; I keep all of them, and get the original 76 rebuilt?..
&gt;
&gt; any suggestions?
&gt;
&gt; later,
&gt; Mike
&gt;
