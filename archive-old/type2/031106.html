&gt; &gt;actually pieces of mine made it to about 1994 or so, but by then it mostly

&gt; The other unobtainable that relates to this is the strap that binds
&gt; the muffler in place. I've been using stainless wire to replace them,
&gt; like about 15 laps over and around and over and around......

well having worked as a machinist for many years I fabricated a part
there, however it has recently failed (fatigue) so I am temporarly using
the same method until I can fabricate a new part with a higher resistance
to fatigue.  (I have a piece of hard drawn Stainless that I think I will
try)

&gt; VERY un DM.

having lived and worked in the &quot;Fatherland&quot; for a couple years I can vouch
for the fact that the DM is a myth, some quality stuff is done, but there
are some real &quot;turkeys&quot; built too!  (consider the NSU RO-80)  and notice
the recent rail accident when a wheel disintegrated at speed...I can
mention many other such &quot;duds&quot; 

remember the VW engine was developed 50 years ago and much progress has
been made since then, for example, Dr. Porsche would have never believed
common use of ECU's in his cars and certainly the ready avaliability of
synthetic lubes, capacitive discharge ignitions, etc, etc etc.  I run my 2
liter 78 stock (sort of) I have added a few guages so I can watch the
engine, I have synthetic lubes in her. and a few other things.  we have
learned a few things since 14 Dec 1977 when my bus was built (yes I have
it's birth cert)

then there is the &quot;Japanese quality&quot;  myth too.
