Subject: Re: [T2] Jay Leno fights California smog revision

&gt;From: Laura Blue

&gt;Not sure if California will be more stringent than
&gt;North Carolina emissions (guessing it will be) but
&gt;BOTH my 1977 and my 1976 passed Mecklenburg County
&gt;smog emission tests the last 2 years.  My '77 had a
&gt;charcoal filter but it wasn't hooked up at the time it
&gt;passed.


Hey there Laura,

I have heard your name mentioned around town through Lou and Rob Henley. 
When did they start testing emissions on pre-'79 autos in Meck. Co.? I don't 
live in Charlotte anymore(Moooresville now) not for like three years but I 
did spend most of my life there. I have had quite a few oldies mostly VW and 
an old '77 Land Cruiser Wagon. But I have never had an emissions test for 
them they were always safety inspections.

Thanks,

Michael Knight
'77 Westy Deluxe, &quot;el Verde&quot;
