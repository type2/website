Subject: RE:  AC belt replacement 

&gt;Next I am going to try to put a new belt on my a/c, but my 
&gt;mech said that it is possible the compressor is seizing up 
&gt;and that is why the belt broke off in the first place.  How 
&gt;would I know if this is what is happening?  

Often times the belt is not replaced simply because the AC quit working 
anyway.  Other times, the tensioner pulley goes bad and starts squealing so the 
belt gets cut.

In case you don't know, you CAN replace the belt fairly easily.  If you don't 
already know how, write me and I'll forward the write-up I did a few years 
ago.  The writeup was for a Porsche 914, but the procedure would be the same.
