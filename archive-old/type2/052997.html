Subject: RE fuel filler neck replacement tips

Your very lucky that the upper hose/flange is OK, it's impossible to find
(Any out there? email if there is) I had to goop mine up to seal it on my
78.

Pretty easy to put it back in and I couldn't find a clear description in
the archives when I did it last year, especially the working inside to
outside for the upper hose flange part. No guarantee that this will be
clear, but this is my experience.

Assemble the whole filler hose assembly that fits on to the tank neck, that
is the upperhose/flange to the metal curved pipe to the lower hose.
Starting from inside where the tank is located slide the assembly up into
the cavity helping it along through the round pop out access hole (excuse
the technical terms there) until the top of the assembly is up near the
filler hole, but inside still. Now make sure that the assembly is twisted
around properly, that is that if the rubber flange is parallel with the
mount area then the lower hose lines up pretty much with the tank pipe. Now
pull it out and put on all your hose clamps and tighten them down. Then
slide it back up there and pull the rubber flange through the filler neck
hole. Don't worry it will flex enough to get through there. So now you have
the rubber flange outside and the filler assembly hanging down inside.
Don't screw the rubber flange on yet because you need some play. Now you
work the lower hose onto tank neck. It will go eventually if it's an 1/8
inch at a time. Now clamp that connection and screw the rubber flange to
the body and your done!
