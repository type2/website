&lt;&lt;  buy a pair
of curve jawed vise grips.  leave them in your tool box and only use them

sharp teeth on the curved jaws.

Get &quot;real&quot; Vise-Grips...There are &quot;barbed&quot; or &quot;salvage&quot; sockets that
are only good to remove a damaged bolt...Pick the one closest in
size to the bolt head and hammer it on. The barbs dig into the head
and enable it to be loosened...The bolt is junk after that but it's out.
