&gt; &gt; Hey all,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I got a message from my landlord stating that I need to be rid of my '71
&gt; &gt; bus. 
Just wondering....

is it registered etc.  If so, can your landlord really tell you to sell a
car because he doesnt like the looks of it?

I know this may be a more political legal question, but im always
curious...

thanks,

Steve
