                                Day Three

6. Swap, meet 

On Wednesday morning I wake up long after the sun comes up. There are 
only two things I must do today: resolve my alternator problem, and meet 
with an editor at lunchtime. The rest of the day is free-form.

I have no idea what time it is. Volkswagen seems to have forgotten to put 
a clock in my dash! Imagine that! There is a digital clock on the face of 
the radio. I haven't set it yet, and since I took the battery out 
yesterday I also haven't reset it. I want to get to work on the 
alternator, but I do not want to be a nuisance. So I will wait for others 
to get noisy first.

While sipping my first cup of coffee, I write down my repair options. I 
have to swap my alternator for the spare one in a box of parts loaned to 
me by fellow listee Abraham Palmer. That part is fairly straightforward, 
but I fret about it anyway. Do I have to remove the whole oil filler 
pipe? That means I have to drain the oil. Or can I wiggle and twist the 
alternator out? I will know soon enough.

It's the second half of the repair that is unresolved. I either have to 
recharge the battery while the bus is at a standstill, or get pushed or 
jump-started and recharge while moving. Either way, I am going to need 
help. And being an ordinary American male, I hate to ask for help. It is 
almost a sickness. Sometimes, when I ask a question to the list, someone 
replies with an answer and, just before they sign their name, writes 
&quot;hope this helps.&quot; That's right. Rub it in. Make sure you let me know 
that I needed your help. Asked for it. Displayed my incompetence and 
vulnerability for all the world to see.

It's a guy thing. I'm not proud of it.

I will go to great lengths to avoid asking for help. This is the one 
thing that money is good for. Paying people to do things for you is not 
asking for help. It is a quid pro quo. But better yet, stock up on 
whatever it takes to avoid asking for help. In this case, a trickle 
charger. The trouble is, I am at least six miles from anyplace that would 
sell a trickle charger, and I left mine at home (make a note: always 
carry charger). Too far to walk, return, and get to my appointment on 
time. Wish I had brought my bike with me. Make a note: always bring bike. 
Then it hits me: this is what the &quot;be prepared&quot; motto is in Boy Scouts -- 
to avoid asking for help. Like I said, it's a guy thing.

I'll probably end up calling AAA. That sort of splits the difference. On 
the one hand, it is asking for help. But they call it &quot;assistance,&quot; and 
that sounds better. On the other hand, having a paid-up membership in AAA 
means that I have made preparations for just this sort of difficulty. 
Resolved.

I get dressed and emerge from the bus. Walking over to the restrooms, I 
survey the RV park for the first time in the light of day. Now, staying 
in an RV park was never part of my original conception of how to be a 
happy VW camper. As I saw it, I would follow a 2-to-1 rule: two nights at 
unimproved campsites followed by a night at a motel. If I had to be in 
public -- libraries, archives, museums -- I could shower at college 
recreational facilities for five dollars, just about anywhere in the 
country. Just flash my faculty ID and mumble something about &quot;reciprocal 
arrangements.&quot; But I thought it wouldn't kill me to try an RV park in 
Tucson. And it wasn't killing me at all. It was clean and quiet. There 
were lots of facilities: restrooms, lots of showers, a laundry, a 
computer room. There was even a woodworking shop! Heck, I could build a 
cabinet while I am here. And although it was expensive at $32 a night, 
that was cheap compared to a stay at Embassy Suites or some such. I 
recognized that this was the correct comparison. Do not compare RV parks 
with primitive campgrounds; compare them with motels. RV parks win, hands 
down.

Back from the restrooms, I decide it's time to start the repair. I raise 
the hatch, clear the rear deck, open the access lid, and lay Abraham's 
alternator inside the engine compartment. One by one I unfasten wires and 
plugs from my alternator and fasten them onto Abraham's, and I clamp the 
lead to the battery. I go forward, turn the key to the on position, and 
there's the light. Now, for the first time, I am willing to believe that 
the problem was both the regulator and the alternator. I get to work 
setting things right.

No sooner have I removed the oil filler and the surrounding tin than an 
older RVer strolls over and asks, &quot;Major repair job?&quot; Now I know what 
&quot;major&quot; means -- it is the legalese that landlords and municipalities use 
to prevent people from taking care of their own vehicles. So I reply, 
&quot;not major at all. I am just swapping my alternator for a spare that I 
brought along with me.&quot; After a brief give-and-take, my interrogator 
reveals that he once had a Westy weekender, and that he drove one time 
&gt;from El Paso to Tehachapi just on the battery. With that confession, 
everything changes. Now we are brothers of the road, fellow travelers. I 
discuss my charging problems, and my makeshift solution of the night 
before, and he asks, &quot;Do you want to use my trickle charger?&quot; Well, 
that's the last thing I expected. In a few minutes, I have a 20 amp 
charge working on my battery while I continue working on the swap. 

My newfound friend is unobtrusive. He strolls over from time to time to 
check up on me, but realizes that I have to keep at the task. I find out 
his name --  it's Alex -- and learn that he was an engineer for Lockheed, 
building missiles, before he retired. His hobby is aviation, so we talk 
P-38s and Spitfires and B-17s for a while. And then he leaves me to my 
work. Not once does Alex imply that he is helping me. Instead, he makes 
an effort to make me think that somehow I am doing him a favor. What a 
gentleman!

Getting the alternator out proves a simpler task than I supposed it would 
be. All you need to do is to loosen up the bolt from the bracket to the 
heat exchanger, and remove the muffler strap (on a California '76). Then 
pitch, yaw, rotate, and the old alternator is out. Installation is the 
reverse. Before long, I am done. I put my tools away, and I rearrange the 
wiring from Alex's charger so that I can lock it up and shower. I also 
have to wash my good jeans, which I have been wearing all morning.While 
they dry, I return the charger to Alex. &quot;Does everything work now?&quot; he 
asks. &quot;It will,&quot; I reply. Then I thank Alex as profusely as I can. 

Soon as my jeans are dry, or dry enough, I slip into them and start 
Peregrine. The light goes off, as it should. But the accelerator sticks! 
I sound like a mad revver, and I am embarassed about it. What's up? No 
time to find out -- I have to make a 1:00 appointment. Back to the 
Holiday Inn, park, don a vest, go inside. I try to find the editor with 
whom I planned to meet, but she has left for the afternoon. I am 23 
minutes late. After several phone calls I reach her at her office and we 
reschedule our appointment for 4:00. Then I drive back to the RV resort 
and pay up for another night. At every stop sign and red light I am 
plagued by this sticking accelerator. Is it the spring? The cable? The 
connection? I don't know, but I don't like doing this to the engine. I 
take my shoes off to drive, so that I can wrap my right toe around the 
top of the pedal for better control.

Back into Tucson, but I am headed this time for the University of Arizona 
where the press office is located. Driving down Speedway in traffic, the 
bus stalls and I can't restart it fast enough for anyone's taste. 
Fortunately, there is a center lane for turns, and enough grade that I 
can roll back and wait. After a good ten minutes, Peregrine starts again 
and I finish the drive to the press. But I hate what just happened. To 
stall in traffic and not restart right away reinforces other peoples' 
prejudices about VW buses. Why do I care? I shouldn't but I do.

The meeting goes well. We talk about three books that I am working on. 
Two are academic: a fat book about field scientists in the American 
southwest, and a shorter book about one scientist who studied desert 
fish. The third book will be a book of essays, travel and natural 
history. Stories left over from research on the academic books. I already 
have the title: Peregrinations of a Field Historian. She likes all three 
projects, and is especially excited about the fish book. Not what I 
expected. &quot;But did he do anything with frogs?&quot; I look around her office. 
There are pictures of frogs on the walls.

7. A relaxed evening

When the meeting is over, I stroll down Speedway Road looking for a place 
to have a quick supper. There's a place called &quot;Greasy Tony's Steak 
Sandwiches,&quot; or something of the sort, and I am perversely drawn to it. I 
order a cheese steak with onions, and wonder whether it will be as good 
as a Hawk Bomb.

[Footnote: In Boston, there are or were a small chain of sub shops owned 
by Tony Harrelson, &quot;The Hawk,&quot; who played for the Cleveland Indians in 
the late 1960s. Hawk Bomb was the name of their cheese steaks sandwiches, 
to which I was once severely addicted.]

It's better!

The drive back to the RV park is uneventful. I settle Peregrine into her 
space, but wait until after sunset to pop the top. She's eyesore enough 
without the ragged canvas hanging from the popper. I find that I am 
acutely ambivalent about Peregrine's appearance. She's ugly and rusty and 
I both admire that and feel embarassed at the same time. Someday I will 
do the bodywork, but not for a while. Mechanicals first, then finish the 
interior, then worry about the exterior.

I built the camper kit myself, mostly of various thicknesses of Baltic 
birch. The plan is basically the same as '76 through '79 Westy campers -- 
everything in a line behind the driver. But different. I have reduced the 
size of the hanging closet to the minimum needed to hang clean shirts, 
and that's just what I use it for. The kitchen cabinet is smaller, too: 
just 24&quot; wide. There is a sink, 12&quot; of counterspace, two cabinet doors 
and a little drawer. No refrigerator; instead I have a small, boxy 
Coleman ice chest that doubles as a stool. The most radical departure 
&gt;from the Westy design is the locker between the closet and the kitchen. 
It is longer and narrower, and I have opened a big hole in the side. 
Above the hole, behind which are shelves, I hinged a table. I can swing 
the table up for access to the shelves, down for use as a table, and when 
I unscrew the leg the table top folds down and provides the door for the 
shelves. Behind that I have a little hatch in the locker top. 

Finally, there is a bookcase behind the front passenger seat. It is 
stocked with travel guides, nature field guides, and other books -- like 
a collection of essays published as a tribute to Gary Snyder, the poet 
and environmentalist. 

Most of it is about half done. Back home, my workspace is my apartment 
balcony, just 8' X 12'. That's where I rebuilt Peregrine's engine, and 
the rebuilding brought the cabinet finishing to a grinding halt. No use 
getting saw dust and sanding dust mixed up with the engine. There will be 
time enough to get the cabinets done. Meanwhile, they are serviceable. I 
like them. I'm even a bit proud.

As darkness falls, I pop the top and fill Peregrine with desert air once 
more. I light my brass miner's lamp and hang a Soleri windbell from the 
handle of the poptop. The wind, which has blown steadily for two days, is 
still, and I am filled with the sounds of the evening. I know that it is 
not a perfect world, far from it; but sometimes it can seem quite good. 
Tonight, for me, it is very good.

Next: A drive across the Tohono O'ohdam reservation; Organ Pipe Cactus 
National Monument; a bad valve stem
