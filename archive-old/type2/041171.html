Some call it, diitg *driving it into the ground* stop driving it and save

&gt; &gt; Hi Volks
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; - Knocking noise under load on hills
&gt; &gt; - In my yard, I ran the throttle by hand,
&gt; &gt; held the engine at high RPM and then abruptly brought it back to
&gt; &gt; idle. As soon as I backed off I could hear the knock
&gt; &gt; - Getting the engine to idle properly was impossible
&gt; &gt; -Often would stall when coming to a stop.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; And yes, ...valves were adjusted properly, etc, etc
&gt;
&gt; This is what John Muir called the &quot;throwing song.&quot; You have a rod that's
&gt; about to let go...nothing a good overhaul won't fix. And if you do it now,
&gt; you may not need a new case.
