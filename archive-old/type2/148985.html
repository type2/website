&gt;Question:  What would be the most likely cause of this symptom?  Speedo 
&gt;cable?  Speedometer itself?  Or some other paranormal cause?

I wouldn't suspect the cable if you come to a complete stop and the needle stops. Isn't 10mph the limiting stop of the speedo anyway?

Inside the speedo is a spring and a magnet. I'm not sure if all 68-79 VDO speedos work the same way but I suspect they do because the principal is so old:

- the cable drives a magnet on the back
- a rotating magnet induces an eddy current into the cup shaped plate that holds the needle which causes it to rotate
- a spring keeps the needle steady

When speedos are rebuilt the spring tension is reset and the magnet is recharged appropriately during calibration. I forget the exact term used.
