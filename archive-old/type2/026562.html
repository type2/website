Subject: WTB:  Type IV Engine Sheet Metal Pieces
Message-ID: &lt;D3C18AEA0EA1D111B8DA00805F85E889011F915D_at_dsntexsrv3.diasham_dot_com&gt;

I need the 2 pieces of sheet metal that go underneath the fan at the very
back of the engine for a type IV motor.  These are the 2 pieces that screw
together and run from side to side with the oil filler sticking up through
one of the pieces and form that nice curve underneath the fan.  

Ugly and surface rust is OK, but I need pieces without rusted holes in them.
If you've got these available for immediate shipping, please let me know off
-list how much you want for them.

Thanks!
