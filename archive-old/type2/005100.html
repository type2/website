Worst case conditions for the internal combustion engine (regarding ignition
timing) is when the engine is at operating temperature and under full load
(full throttle). The 009 and 050 are timed at 30-32 full advance because any
more timing than this and the engine will detonate (ping).

The problem with the &quot;full advance&quot; method of timing (though it's correct
for the 009/050) is that under less than full load conditions (part
throttle) the engine WANTS MORE IGNITION TIMING. Vacuum advance senses this,
and gives the engine a little more depending on the conditions.

Engine's timing requirements change with RPMs; that's why distributors
advance as RPMs go up. Actually, then need to RETARD at around 6K RPMs, but
most people don't need/care about that. :-)

Engines also need more advance under part throttle conditions (cruise),
since the cylinder's don't fill as much (the throttle is the restriction),
and the reaction (&quot;burn&quot;) in the combustion chamber is slower with a
partially filled mixture rather than being full.

So, the simply explaination is that the 009/050 can NOT properly time an
engine to what the engine needs, since timing requirements vary depending on
engine load. That's why the vacuum advance unit is superior for street
applications.

The 009/050 should be used on engines that

1) don't have enough vacuum to operate the vacuum advance (huge camshaft?)

2) don't have the proper vacuum advance port

3) operate at idle or full throttle ALL THE TIME (obviously the vac advance
isnt' needed).

I hope this clears this issue up once and for all.
