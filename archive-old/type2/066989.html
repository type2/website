&gt;&gt; Where you live:

Ocala, Florida (approx 90 miles from Jacksonville, Orlando or Tampa if you
wanna triangulate) 30 miles SE of Gainesville, Florida.

&gt;&gt; What is you van: year, model

Personal vehicles:

65 SingleCab,
67 Panel
71 Westie

&gt;&gt; What is your name:

Kevin Murray
Wife (writer) Didi
Daughter (student) Erinn
Cat(s) John Lennon &amp; Scooter

&gt;&gt; What is the name of your van:

My SingleCab's  name is &quot;Lemonhead&quot;

&gt;Services available:

Basic or extended B&amp;B.. we're minutes from the interstate, have
a Roll-Back wrecker (if needed) and a shop equipped for most
minor or major repairs.  Spare bedroom now the &quot;daughter&quot; has
gone to school, and a fold-out couch (and shower) at the shop
if one needs to crash.

There are a couple of VW-Friendly FLAPS in our area, but stock
on hand for anything exotic may be iffy on short notice. WE are
the local VW-graveyard ;-), but there are a few which may uncover
an additional part or two....


Age:  39

Thanks Jean-Baptiste...a nice gesture to benefit fellow L-members!
