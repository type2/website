On the late bay AFAIK the dash clock was only on the Champagne Edition
campers and vans, I've owned one of each. I believe only 78 and 79? Both of
mine were 78s.

The dash clock on the early bays (with the silver discs in the center) I
have been told were more common. I have one from a junkyard. I love the
look of the old gauges and I'm trying to talk my wife into letting me
convert my gauges to the old style (I have a complete set). She seems to
think there will be some compatibility issue with the speedo or gas gauge
or wiring, but she didn't use those exact words... I think she said
something like &quot;you'll get it all torn apart with wires everywhere and then
the bus won't run for a month until you get around to fixing it&quot;. I don't
know where she gets these crazy notions ;-)

But seriously, anybody aware of issues between older gauges (I think mine
are 69) and newer busses? Speedometer error? gas gauge error?
