&gt; Okay Volks:
&gt; 
&gt; Being shipped to me tomorrow is a brand new 0-mile
&gt; longblock, coming from Nogales AZ. via Beetlemex (who
&gt; comes highly recommended).  The engine costs $980. and
&gt; has hydraulic lifters. There's the rub...hydraulic
&gt; lifters require extra clean oil, and to that end, the
&gt; Beetles have an oil filter which comes off the oil
&gt; pump.  Unfortunately, it doesn't really work on a bus
&gt; (type 1, at least) because the carrier bolts for the
&gt; moustache bar occupy the same space.  Miguel's solution
&gt; is to just attach the engine to the moustache bar,
&gt; which although he claims works fine for some guy in his
&gt; shop isn't something I'm willing to try with a brand
&gt; new engine and tranny.

You'll have to look at the engine, but is there a possibility of
fabricating a custom moustache bar that clears the filter pump?  This
would seem an ideal solution.

I don't agree with the &quot;change oil often&quot; technique.  Changing the oil
at short intervals doesn't stop dirt from circulating with the oil. 
Dirt will still be trapped in the lifters, which are particularly
sensitive to grunge in the oil.

If you can't fab a special moustache bar, then you'll have to go to
some sort of remote filter setup.

I'm really interested in how this goes, as I will probably be
following the same path shortly.
