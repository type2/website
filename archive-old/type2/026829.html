Hey everyone:

I just joined this great list.  Looks like a good one.

What is this rumour going around about Kymco closing up soon? Anyone know 
anything about this?  Those guys are the best and if they go out of 
business, we will all suffer a loss of a great parts business.

I have purchased tons of parts from them over the years.

Carl
