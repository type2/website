Subject: Re: type 4 CR and deck height
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.OSF.3.91.990601164449.1255A-100000_at_Sherlock.SIMS.Berkeley.EDU&gt;

I've never found out what the &quot;proper&quot; deck height of a type 4 engine is 
supposed to be, though I've seen the ranges mentioned in the Wilson book.

Assuming you know what the &quot;proper&quot; deck height is, and assuming you're 
using all brand new stock parts, then the answer is &quot;of course!&quot;  You know 
VW assembly line workers weren't measuring deck height when they were 
originally building these engines.  They were just slapping new parts 
together and manufacturing tolerances got compression ratios in 
individual cyliders &quot;close enough&quot; to whatever the engineers had said it 
should be.

If you're not using all brand new stock parts then the answer is not as 
clear.  IF your case hasn't been machined and your crank is stock AND 
your heads haven't been flycut, then you're probably safe in just 
assemblying things using the stock barrel shim and head shim.  

By the way, you may see mention of a VW tech bulletin saying to do away 
with the head shim; I've got it if you want it and it's been posted to 
the list.  But the tech bulletin also mentions the use of a 1.6mm 
(about .063&quot;) barrell shim, and the barrell shims that came with my new 
P&amp;C's were more like .445mm (.0175&quot;).  I DID cc my heads and concluded I 
needed to use the head shims to get my &quot;effective&quot; deck height higher, 
and my CR lower.

&gt; to be sure.
