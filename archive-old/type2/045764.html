You know.. it's not a bad idea to pull the injectors out and make sure
all the seals are good and were put on correctly.  I just pulled mine
out and the PO did a HORRIBLE job on them.  The metal rings that fit
around the big gasket were not all the over the rubber gasket and the
rubber that contacts the manifold was all cracked.  I could hear the air
leaking.

After I fixed it, it all runs peachy!

&gt; Ok, so it's not the cold start valve, and judging by ear, I'd say it's
&gt; one (or both) of the two right side injectors is leaking.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, my bag-o'-spare injectors is likewise in my storage space.
