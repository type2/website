Heh, I meant to respond to this earlier, but got caught-up with the 
timing thing :-)

&gt; So far it runs really well. Full advance brings it up into the low 
&gt; 30's. It runs really well, pulling 70MPH on highway 401 and holding it 
&gt; on all but the worst of the hills.

Very cool.  Now that my engine is past break-in and my ACN SVDA's 
advance diaphragm is also broken in, I am enjoying good highway 
cruising speeds, as well.  I can easily cruise at 68 MPH at 3/4 
throttle, unless I'm being rocked by that gnarly diagonal cross-wind on 
101 between Candlestick and the airport (and people wonder why the 
Giants wanted a new ballpark).

Hills are still sometimes a challenge... the approach on 101 south to 
the Waldo Tunnel in Marin County, heading back towards San Francisco, 
is a long uphill, and I generally have to downshift into 3rd to do it.  
Even at WOT I see my speed gradually decline, and I give up once it 
drops to 45 MPH

I'm looking forward to setting my timing with Richard's way cool VAG 
flywheel position sensing device.
