Subject: Re: [T2] Power Bleeder

I used a MityVac hand pump and it worked quite well. I had to empty the 
cup about thirty times. Harbor Freight has some MityVac units but if 
you need to use it any time in the next century try your FLAPS.

&gt; Tell me why I shouldn't do this and maybe offer alternatives if you 
&gt; have any
