&gt; I have a 1971 Riviera Pop Top. I used to have a 1974 bus. It had an hatch
&gt; to gain access to the engine compartment. The 1971 does not. Would it be
&gt; feasible to cut one from a later model bus and weld it into my bus? Has
&gt; anyone ever done this?

Jim:
VW didn't think you needed one, why should you? Seriously, sounds like a good
idea,  but why stop there? I'd cut it out of a Vanagon, an early one with the
steel hatch lid, and really have the room. Several years of working on
Vanagons have spoiled me!
