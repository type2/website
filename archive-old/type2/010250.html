Hello everyone,

I've been working on all three of my buses lately with some success due in 
part to the advice and help I've gotten from list members. Thanks!

I've recently noticed that one of my late model buses misfires on the number 
3 cylinder. I was able to determine this by pulling the wire off the 
distributor one at a time.  It seems that the misfiring lessens as the 
engine warms up but it does not go away entirely.

What to do?  I'm a little concerned because it's the number 3 cyl. and 
everyone pays special attention to that one.  This is a '74 type IV engine 
with an .009 distributor and a Weber dual barrel progressive carb. (No I did 
not put these items together, I just got a really good deal on this bus as 
is).  My plan is to adjust my valves this coming weekend or the next. I'm 
hoping this will resolve the problem.

Any guesses on what this is? I don't notice any loss of power...

Thanks again, you all are great!

-Jeffrey
