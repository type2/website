Subject: Re: [T2] Cooling - 1600Sp vs 1600DP

[...]

Depending on your case, you will need 2 step studs: 8 x 6 for the cooler
bracket. Also you will need to remove the short 6mm stud from the case and put
a longer one in for the 3rd hole on the bracket. You will need the correct
step-down seals.
Here is a little info on the seals:

&gt; I am thinking to upgrade my stock component 1600SP cooling system  to
&gt; 1600DP sizings.
&gt;
&gt; I guess I need:
&gt; Doghouse (larger) oil cooler.
&gt; Tin (deeper) to house same.
&gt; Larger volume cooling fan.
&gt;
&gt; What else is needed, and what is the best plan of attack for getting the
&gt; conversion parts on the cheap side. - Vendors, parts yard sources, etc. ??
&gt;
&gt; Cooler, of course, I think should be bought as new.
