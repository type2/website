&gt; English is the appropriate language in Canada (or Frnch and English if 
&gt; Quebec is involved)

both english and french are the official languages all across canada although 
realistically english is by far and away the predominant language. French is mostly 
concentrated to quebec, the maritimes and pockets of french settlements across 
canada
&gt; 
.  Canadian citizens on the list should be 
&gt; concerned about this incident since it is THEIR country that made the 
&gt; decision.  

Well I have never considered Border patrol to reflect my own beleief system, far 
from it. I can't condone their actions, but generally country's and gov'ts around the 
world get very paranoid when they hear about drugs. It is too bad that Eddie's 
friend got convicted w/ possession 'cos that rap will last a long time. Yes it is a 
pisser but I am not that surprised. I would expect similar or worse treatment from 
American Border Guards (and believe me I have received in all on &quot;suspicion&quot;). 
Please note that my beef is w/ American Border guards, not American citixens (if 
that makes sense)
