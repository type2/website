Subject: FS - 71 westie - Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada

So this guy down the road from me has a 71 westie - the interior is in
very
good cond'n - but
the rockers are done for as are the front floors - I suspect that there
is
other serious rust
damage as well - anyway - he'll probably take $350.00 Cdn - so that's
about
$250.00 US - It
runs well and most mechanical is in good shape - full westie interior
and
gas heater - Id take
it but alas no garage and a smokkkkkkkin 59 standard in the driveway
DEMANDING attention -
anyway email me for his phone number
thanks
jdd 59 std
