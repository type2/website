Subject: Fiddling with a thermostat for fun.

In looking at my thermostat which seems to have failed, but not completely, I found the following info.
When cold, it still had a small amount of it not compressed. This led me to believe that it had a pinhole somewhere. I placed it in 90 deg. C water and noticed that it did indeed expand properly, but there were the most miniscule bubbles coming from one edge of a bellows fold. Hmmmmm. I took out my magnifying lens I used for reloading ammo, and spotted the tiniest abrasion/stress cracking right on the edge of the fold. This was where the liquid/gas from inside was escaping. I let it cool to normal temp and shook it. It still had the factory liquid in it, so it wasn't a complete write-off. After having seen Ratwell's page on thermostat repairs, I thought, what the heck, and put some super fine solder there. As to whether it will last due to expansion and contraction, it will be interesting. I'm wondering what else I could have used to seal this, maybe hi-temp epoxy, or hi temp silicone. Don't know how much internal pressure is generated though, so I don't know if epoxy or sil
icone will hold.
All in the name of fiddling however, which is what Type 2 people seem to like to do. :-)
Thoughts always appreciated, please don't start a thread on &quot;just get a new one&quot; or &quot;why be cheap&quot; etc; I get enough of that from one listee on here. This is for fun.
Regards,
Courtney
