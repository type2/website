Subject: Gas Leak T25 Filler Tube Tank Grommet Replacement

Hi, some help appreciated please if anyone could...

T25 Transporter first Reg 1981 (UK, 1600cc CT engine):
Have a Gas leak if I fill up beyond about half way.  Current theory is
culprit is perished rubber grommet (the big one - 2 or 3 ins across)
which seals the filler tube as it goes into the tank.

I know how to free up the filler tube at the fuel cap end,
 take off the little breather pipe etc.,
but do I then just yank the filler out of the tank and stick a new grommet
in and slide the tube back in?  Is it easy?  And do I need to add anything
like grease or other sealer to make the joint gas-tight????

Can't risk just pulling it and finding I can't get it back in and sealed up
again just at the moment, for unfortunate reasons involving needing
transport to get to hospital regularly....

I am an experienced VW mechanic, but not for a long time..... my bus time
was back in the 70s.

Cheers, Dave Thomas, Aberdeen, Scotland.
