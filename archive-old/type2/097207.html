Subject: insurance question....

Hi
I am hoping someone here has experience getting extra insurance for their
&quot;historic&quot; VW's. I have asked several &quot;historic&quot; or &quot;classic&quot; insurance
companies, but they will not insure my westy. Either because it is a camper
or that I want to actually use it! So my question to the group is who are
you folks getting insurance from? Many of you have put a fair bit of money
into restoring VW's how are you insuring them? Any help would be
appreciated, oh by the way I live in MD in case someone knows that their
company has a license to sell insurance in MD.
Peace
Meg
