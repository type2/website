&gt; I knew I had seen an advert for a video showing engine rebuilds somewhere,
I
&gt; know there's one for the long block but it's not that good &amp; no good to me
&gt; with an upright. Anyway I found an old copy of 'VolksWorld' and there
almost
&gt; 3 years ago was an advert for just what I need! I was sure that it would
be
&gt; unavailable as I've never seen any more adverts since then, but sure
enough
&gt; it was available &amp; I spent well over an hour talking about the video, part
&gt; selection &amp; the pro's &amp; con's of different variations. The great thing was
&gt; that _at_ no point did I feel that the guy wanted to get away or that I was
&gt; wasting his time, that counts for a lot in my book. Anyway I ordered the
&gt; Video for £19.99 &amp; it arrived this morning, 3 hours long!!
&gt; Great clear detail, all I need is to get the TV in the work shop &amp; I'm
away.
&gt; If anyone's interested I could put a minute or so as an MPG &amp; send it. All
&gt; round nice guy is hard to find _at_ the moment, but this has restored some of
&gt; my confidence in our hobby.

&gt; BTW
&gt; He can send to Europe for £25 or the US for £30, BUT this would be in PAL
&gt; format &amp; might need to be converted depending on your VCR.
