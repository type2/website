Subject: Westy Website Year Questions

SOmeone questioned my estimate of tnhe date of the westybrochure page that I created on http://members.xoom_dot_com/sglw/westybrochure

I agree that the specification listed on page 8 shows an engine of 1679 vv. This learly applies o a 1972 bus.
Page 9 states a top &amp; ruising speed of 78 mph, also not a 69-70 bus.
But! when I look at the front wheel on page 10, it does not have the disc brake wheels, also it has a painted hub cap for commercial vehicles.
What year is this?
