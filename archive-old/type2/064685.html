Subject: 74 Bus FS in WI

We are in the process of getting a 78 bus. We don't have room for our 74
bus, so we need to get rid of it. We decided to get the newer bus because I
don't have the time right now to do the body work on the old one.

Right now the engine is out of it. It needs to have a cylinder head
replaced (we have a rebuilt one from Mofoco waiting to be installed). It
has dual Weber carbs. The seats are in very good shape (the front and
middle seats were originally from an earlier 70s bus). The body has some
rust on the pan and rust-through along the bottom edge of driver's side.
Also the bus has a number of serious creased dents on both sides and the
back. There are a number of holes from a dent puller. The rear bumper and
engine hatch are dented.

I'd be happy to get $500 for the bus. If you're interested, let me know. I
need to get rid of the bus by August 15.
