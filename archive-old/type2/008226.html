Hey Y'all,
  I have been working on the '70 this week and finally got around to
doing some much needed repairs.
  I got a steering wheel from a local yard out of a 79 Bus. It has a
thicker rim on it and is softer rubber not the hard plastic like the
earlier ones. I had to modify it a little to make it fit, but I am
glad I did. The improved feel is great, and it looks great. The style
is the same so it looks like original, only the die hard bus nut would
know it is not stock. If you want to do this to an early bus, plan on
spending about 3 hours making it work. Its nice not to have any cracks
in the steering wheel and it will never crack.
  While I was installing the stereo I pulled down the fuse box to
connect a wire and I got rusty water all over the place. I found that
the water was in the high beam relay. It must have got driped on from
the leaking window seal. It was really rusty inside the relay and the
high beams have never worked, now I know why. I replaced the window
seal about three months ago, but didn't know the damage it had caused
to the relay. I didn't have a new relay, but I did have a relay out of
my 73 parts bus. It is a lot smaller and does not plug in. I simply
made 4 short wires to plug into the fuse block and it alows the relay
to be positioned on its side out of the way if the window ever leakes
again it won't hit the relay. My high beams now work as they are
designed to. As you can see I'm a little cheap.
  I also put some mew seals on the pop top. I didn't have the money
for the replacement seals, but a friend was parting out an old Chevy
Celebrity and I pulled all the door seals and trunk seal. I found that
the door seals are a perfect fit on the top and seal real good around
the base. I used the trunk seal across the back edge (its an early top
'70). I have no wind noise or water leaks. Not too bad for free. I
know it is no the original, but it looks like it is.

Freinds don't let friends drive water cooled.
