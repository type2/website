Subject: brake booster

question is:

What would make a power brake system fill the booster with fluid, and pull the
pedal to the floor on it's own?


This bus has a history ... the first time this happened the [say original, who
knows] booster and master cylinder were replaced with a rebuilt one... worked
for about 2 years , it repeated itself.

Booster fills with fluid [I thought it was brake fluid, in fact I am sure it is
brake fluid] 
Brake pedal pulls itself to the floor when the engine is running

That rebuilt booster and master was replaced with a &quot;fresh off a scrapped bus
with working brakes&quot; known good used master and booster,,  this situation worked
for about a year

Now, 1 year later , that used booster is full of fluid , and sucks the pedal to
the floor.

Each time, the &quot;customer&quot; complains that he never had to ever add fluid to the
reservoir, even though about 2 liters spill out of the booster

Vac check valve seems to work when tested
The inside of the rebuilt booster was full of rust,,, leading me to believe the
fluid was actually water... or mostly water,, 
could the vent be sucking in water?

so:
??? All of them have deteriorated so they leak enough fluid past the master into
the booster?

Could this fluid come from somewhere else?

What do you think causes this???
