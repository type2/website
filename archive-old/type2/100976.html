&gt; &gt; How do you ship very large items across the U.S.?
&gt; &gt; Colorado / Virginia
&gt; 
&gt; It depends how big you are talking about, but I've found that Greyhound has a more generous size limitation than UPS or USPS.

I've used Yellow Freight to ship an engine accross the country, strapped
on  a pallet and wrapped in plastic and then covered with a cardboard
homemade cover.  have done it twice both times arrived undamaged (this is
a T-4 engine) cost about $100
