&gt;I don't think you can put in the distributor in 180 degrees off.  At least
on my 1700 with 009, it only goes
&gt;in one way.  If it were backwards, timing would be way off and would not
run at all.

It is true that the distributor can only go in one way,  but the orientation
of the rotor once the distributor is seated is entirely depending on the
orientation of your distributor drive gear in the case. That means that you
can have the distributor seated and notch pointed in any direction, then you
can find TDC for #1, spin the distributor so the notch lines up with the
rotor, and proceed to set the valves, and achieve a well-tuned engine that
runs great, and in most cases you'll be able to time it properly. But when
the next person goes in to try and tune it up they will be confused. Another
issue is that the stock vacuum can and condensor can get get caught on the
case if you're trying to time a motor with a mis-aligned drive gear. So it
is always preferable to straighten out your drive gear to the proper
orientation when you get the next opportunity, but don't lose the spring in
the case.
