You raise a very good point.  I want my exhaust heat dissipating from the
heads ASAP.  I've seen coating sites advertise retaining engine heat with
ceramic exhausts to improve performance...not what I'm looking for. It seems
to me there would also be a fairly significant heat differential between 1
&amp;3 vs 2 &amp;4...not good. I'm investigating stainless options now.  Maybe an
ideal exhaust would be all stainless, with 3 pieces from the collector so
you could just change out the muffler when needed.  Sources anyone?  I
know...custom and lots o' $$.

all this talk about ceramic coating of mufflers/headers has gotten me
thinking:

How much of the cooling system relies on good heat transfer properties
of the header/muffler system, and, how does ceramic coating effect these
HT properties.
