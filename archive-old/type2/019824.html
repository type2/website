Subject: Re: [T2] 72 Westy color  L90D pastel white or L567 ivory?

&gt; red, yellow, and beige over its life.  My point is, there is another
&gt; early 70's white, and I don't remember the name.  And I thought
&gt; in fact it was the one used on campers of '71 to about '75 vintage.
&gt; I want to say it is more white than pastel, but not nearly as white
&gt; as alpine white.  Maybe it was just a commercial color though.

These are the white colors I know of on the Baywindow:

- Pastell White (L 90 D)
- Pearl White (L 87)
- Lotus White (L 282)
- Atlas White (L 91 Z) (only used for roofs of microbuses)

And of course there are also the Beige colors: Mexico Beige, Ceylon
Beige and Mexico Beige, don't know them really because they're not very
common here. Are they close to white?

Anyway, if you want to know what type of white it was just check out the
plate behind the drivers seat and look the color-code up in the list on
my homepage:

If any codes ar missing I would really like to know!
