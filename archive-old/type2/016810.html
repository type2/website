Caution.  I ordered one over a month ago and am still waiting.
To be fair, they told me there was a back order on one of the
parts but its getting to be a long time.

I'm going to call them today to find out what's going on.

&gt; Mike:
&gt;
&gt; I just took a look at Kymco's web site, and from the looks of the order
&gt; form, it does appear that they anticipate doing business with customers
&gt; outside of North America - the pull-down menu for method of shipment
&gt; includes &quot;overseas freight&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; They don't ask for credit card info on the order form, so you're at no
&gt; risk if you just go ahead and place an order and see what happens.
