Subject: six draws an audience

the day started ordinarily. one bus in the carport, one on the lawn.
another out of the way to make room for the buddy pulling a wasserboxer.
his syncro on the curb and another buddy pulls up in his 73 daily driver.
six buses and neighbors i had never met coming out of the woodwork
remarking about the days in the splitty... the days in the splitty.

all i got accomplished was a couple sunday conversations. that, and my
mudflipper. yep - i cut a skin diving fin in half and mounted it in front
of the propane tank. bwah.. vw bracket and all.
