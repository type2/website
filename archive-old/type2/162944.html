Subject: RE: [T2] bodywork on my bus continued

JT Beaufort, SC counselled:
&gt;
&gt;Get an angle grinder, of good quality and amps.  The wire wheels that fit
them, both corse and fine are great for taking it down to the metal.

	There's a newer type of thick, very porous, dark plastic 
wheel that works a treat.  The factory that makes them in Auckland 
was taken over recently by Rubbermaid with a view to closure, but I 
imagine such a ferociously good device will go on being mfd 
somewheres.  They rip off paint phenomenally, but will be gentler to 
any metal that may lie just underneath (there probably is some).
