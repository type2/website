Subject: It wont spark it all!!!

 
Today I worked on the '61 bus again... I looked around and give her a 
start again. The motor did actually rotate, just a &quot;stall&quot;! I checked out 
the sparkplugs and distrubtion cap, there's no spark at all. I got the new 
battery, also the indiactor red lights are on, Is it coil or is there 
something that I overcame?
