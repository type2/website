&gt; Can I jack up the rear end of my bus from the engine

I dont think id try that, the way ive done it is to
put a 4x4 that is about the width of the bus and stick
the jack in the middle just to the front of the rear
wheels. This will enable you to put both jack stands,
and wont harm the undercarraige.
