Don't worry Ian, plenty of friends on the coast, especially if your
behind the wheel of a splitty! Same with the city skate-grunge beanie
heads - they love 'em. 

On more than one occasion I've been driving through suburbia in the
splitty and witnessed young males falling to their knees and bowing to
the almighty power of the splitty. - Truely!

Kinda humbling really,
