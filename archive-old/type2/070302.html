&gt;How pricey are the Jacob Engineering Systems and do they deliver any
&gt;benefits over the $80 JCW CDI kit?

Roy,
Seems to me that when I called Jacobs about a system for my Westy, they wanted a
little over $400. Yes, that's US dollars. It can't possibly be just another CDI
system, at that price. Sounds pretty high tech. They are supposed to read the
resistance or the spark while it's occuring and adjust the voltage to compensate
for EACH cylinder, fire multiple sparks PER POWER STROKE, have optional rev
limiters, adjustable timing from the driver's seat (seems scarry to me, for an
air-cooled engine that's ten feet behind me), and yes, they must use their own
coil. I don't give a flyin' flock WHAT it's got. The price scared me off
immediately. Looks like they're geared toward the high-end performance (read:
sponsored racing) crowd. I kept my points, changed 'em four or five times in
three years. Saved a bundle. BTW, I don't know if Jacobs is CARD certified.
Ought to be, for that price.
