Subject: [T2] Catching Mouses

Peanut Butter is excellent for catching mice.  I have heard that a mouse
knows a trap is deadly, but their love for peanut butter is greater than
their fear of death.  I wonder who asked the mouse this?

Decon is supposed to dehydrate the mouse until it dies, leaving a dead mouse
that supposedly won't smell.  Supposedly.

Years ago in my 72 Bus I found evidence of a mouse/mice living somewhere in
the passenger compartment.  This was when my gas heater was quiet.  Then for
a few days the heat the heater put out smelled sort of funny, and the fan
would rattle, and I concluded the mouse was no more.

Happy Friday.

PS  Thanks for the advice on selling my Bus a while back.  I think I will
just keep it, because it isn't costing me anything, and I know as soon as I
sell it I'll want another one.
