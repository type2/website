Subject: 79 westy for sale

   This is an auto 79 westy for sale, rust free in above average condition. Complete top end rebuild 3 months ago. Bus 
has been from Cali through AZ to Canada to New York to Florida and is on it's way back to cali. This is the swiss boys 
bus, you might remember a few post of their adventures. Well Patrick is ready to go back to Swiss and needs to sell 
the bus. $2500 or best offer!!!!!!!!!!!!! Everything works on this rust free beauty and would make a great ride for 
someone not in a hurry.
    Patrick was in Taos NM today and can meet someone just about anywhere for the sale of the bus, most camping 
gear comes with it as he only will need his clothes when he leaves. There are enough tools to rebuild the engine (I 
know they used them to do the top end at my shop).
   Please pass the word to all list and anybody who might be interested in it
