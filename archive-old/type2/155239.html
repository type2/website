Subject: Re: [T2] Loaf of Bread

&gt; It's easy to drive a fast car fast...But dangerous to drive it at its limit...

I think that sums it up.  Faster, more refined cars aren't as much fun
because driving them within what's safe and law-abiding is too easy
and uneventful.

I also have a LBC (mini).  Both the bus and the mini are a hoot to
drive.  Fun driving with the mini is drifting through a corner on a
gravel road at 15 mph.  Fun driving with the bus is driver position
and starting the corner after you've gone by it.

I've actually been driving the mini to work lately just because of a
temporary gravel road on the way.
