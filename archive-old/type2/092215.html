Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust loudness

Richard funny you should say that.

When I first got my 78 it had a stock exhaust, which I
mistakenly haced off.  I was young and foolish and the
guy at the beetle shop said it was the thing to do. 
Also I was broke and the exhaust I put on was like $75
bucks.

Ive been through three exhausts now and they all seem
to do the same thing:

below 65 they are as quiet as possible
at 60 MPH they get louder
at 65 MPH they start to get quieter
at 70 mph they are quiet
over 70 MPH the road/wind noise is too loud to actually
hear the engine :-)


I 've been looking at busses around here and they
either have the stock exhasut which seems really quiet,
or they have an aftermarket which seem noisier.

I wonder if the crossoverpipe helps with the noise
issue.

Anyway, if anyone has and idea, Id like to hear it too.
Logan
