Subject: Re: [T2] '71 Air Oil Bath Warm/Cool Flow Control Gizmo

Please nix the portion of my request about getting an image ... I just 
remembered that mine used to have something there, went down into the 
garage, and found the missing bit (spring) through some careful 
detective work. I have now reinstalled said bit. (Which was removed in 
fall when my German mechanic buddy was fooling around with it, trying to 
figure out how to compensate for it not working.)

While reinstalling this bit, I wondered if the thermostat -- which is 
brass and screws in and out of the tin -- might just need some sort of 
adjusting (more in, more out) to get this thing to trip. My guess, 
though, is that the little plunger that sticks out of it just no longer 
works.

And so the question simply becomes: Is there a source for the wax pellet 
thermostat? It does not look like it could possibly be any easier to 
replace, if only the part exists.

If the answer is No, then I need to think about compensating for it, 
which would be a drag.

This might be a good time to mention that I have a spare canister that 
is probably from a '68-70 -- looks just like mine except it has some 
kind of contraption attached to the top of the snout near the flap 
weight. The tin and horsehair are in good shape. The rubber arm had a 
tear in it, which was taped over with black duct tape, but is otherwise 
not cracked. If you have any interest, let me know and I can take pics. 
Will sell, trade or barter. Have other parts from a '70 bus, a few from 
a '72, also. Some big, some small. Any that don't interchange with my 
'71 are up for grabs.

Thanks,

tank
