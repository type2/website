Subject: Re: [T2] remanufactured brake parts

I don't have my Bentley here, but I think that the '71/'72 calipers are
smaller and the pads are thinner than the '73 and later.  If they gave you
the latter (fatter) pads and the earlier calipers that would explain why
they don't fit.  Also, do you have the piston retaining plates?  (See
Bentley)   Finally tracked down a set, after not having them for many years
(Thanks, Joe at BustedBus) and put them in last night.

Good news - no more squeal.  Bad news - no more squeal.  (That distinctive
squeal was our Early Warning System that told my wife that I had arrived at
her office to pick her up.)   8^)

&gt; Howdy all.  I have a '71 Campmobile, and have been
&gt; changing the front brakes.  I had the one-bleeder
&gt; style calipers, which I traded for core on the
&gt; remanned two bleeder type that Advance said was it.
&gt; Also, they gave me two of the same side, as any way I
&gt; turn them, the pistons are turned differently, i.e.
&gt; one side is up and one side is down.  I think they
&gt; just gave me two of the same side.  The real problem
&gt; lies in that the pads they gave me are too large to
&gt; fit between the interior of the caliper and the rotor.
&gt;  Yes, the pistons are in all the way, but the pad will
&gt; not even engage the piston, as it is stopped by the
&gt; caliper.  I contacted Advance about the problem, and
&gt; they said that one company listed one part number for
&gt; '71-79 for front pads, and that another company listed
&gt; a different part for '71-72 and for '73-79.  The '71
&gt; pads from the other company are on order to check if
&gt; they work any better.  My question to you, list, is 1.
&gt;  has anybody else encountered this, and 2.  What the
&gt; hell did you do?
&gt;
&gt; thank you,
&gt;
&gt; Blake
