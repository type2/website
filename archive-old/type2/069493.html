Subject: Re: before I go to sears :-)

Speaking as he who just finished the journey on which James is about to
embark...the axle nut is indeed 46mm, all the 1500 splits with the 1
tonne suspension and 68 [I am not sure about 69 and 70] buses had 'em.
The drums and hub are one piece...hence they gotta come off to see
what's going on inside.

The hammer off tool will work....but you'll risk damaging the nut [and
other than perhaps Clara, no one has been planting these for years ;)]
The tool is also fairly useless for obtaining the correct torque when
the nut goes back on [correct torque is important here...overdue it
and your seals, bearings, and reduction box can suffer :(]

As for 1/2&quot; drive breaker bars..phtaw!  I broke two getting the
driver's side nut off the '66 resto [without a cheater bar].  The 3/4&quot;
slide bar may bend...but it is unlikely to break...even with three
180+ guys and 10ft of pipe.  The best solution I have found is a large
cast die handle that my step father had for threading pipes and shafts
for marine diesels [dies up to 4 or 5&quot; in diameter] that has both a
3/4&quot; and 1&quot; drive ratchet insert and a six foot handle...the mere
sight of it scares the nuts of the van ;)

As for a reliable 46mm socket that won't cost you Snap-on prices, try
this:

Part No.:       40-346
Manufacturer:   Armstrong Bros. Tool Co.
                5200 W. Armstrong Ave.
                Chicago, Il
                U.S.A.  60646
                Phone:  (312) 763-3333

It is supposedly guaranteed, though I cannot attest to that as mine
has never split [even when used with an air ratchet...but don't tell
Armstrong that ;)]

The socket was $50.00 cdn here in Canada....that should make it about
$30.00 south of the border.


Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Splits...Oh. my!

Roy

BTW:  Jim, if you see this...could you ad it to the tool FAQ for the
archives and r.a.m.vw.ac?
