&gt; &gt; hmmmm, take an old block, put in the crank and cam, connecting rods but no
&gt; &gt; pistons and cyl...also put on the pulley so you can see the marks. sit
&gt; &gt; that on a table.
&gt; 
&gt; Yah, that was my thought, sort of.  I would leave the con rods off as well

well I would put em on, I just put something across the lower head studs
to hold up the con rods, this give a good indication of where the engine
is in the cycle.  same with the cam, would be good to show the valve
action but haven't worked that out yet

&gt; to prevent floppiness.  I don't even think you need a cam.  Just the case,
&gt; the crank, and dist drive gear.  A degree wheel pulley on the rear, a
&gt; motor with similar pulley and a belt to drive it.  the case and crank
&gt; could be absolute junkers, as there would only be minimal lube (probably
&gt; put some assembly lube/grease on the mains for the demo), but minimal
&gt; speed as well (200RPM would be plenty)  If the case were truly dead, we

heck I would crank it around by hand, put some sort of crank handle on the
flywheel end of the crankshaft.


now if you find a really good 2liter case I am looking for one.

PS the decel valve came today, will probably put it on Sat and will let
you know if that solved the problem
