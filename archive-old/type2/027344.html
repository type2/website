Well it's Friday so I guess a little controversy with Karl is in order...
  If anit-seize compound is so bad (changes the heat dissipation of the 
spark plug leading to overheating of same) why does the Good Book (Bentley) 
spend two paragraphs telling us of the importance of using it, and of not 
installing a dry plug in the head? Is there another compound Karl would 
recommend? If not, I'd rather lose a plug or two then my threads.
With all due respect for Karl,
    Roland
