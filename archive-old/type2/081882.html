Subject: Re: [T2] white stag tent still in biz?




 all i need is four elbow corners and the roofline &quot;straights&quot;
&gt; running parallel to the bus. can any white stag tent owners tell me: is
&gt; there a perpendicular rod across the top middle keeping the two main
&gt; pillars apart?

Nope, but a center pole from the inside of the bus or a self made pole would
be a good addition as this tent seems to really store the water on the roof
until it soaks thru and lands on the waterproof floor.

 not seen on the tent-site. also - are the roofline
&gt; &quot;straights&quot; one piece, or two each with their own connectors inbetween

from the corners there are 3 pieces in between each corner.  Two long ones
with the holes and one short one with a 165 degree bend with the little
button clip that slips into the straight poles.

Hope this helps..

Peace Brother,
Snoopy
