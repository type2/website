Subject: Re: [T2] Vehicle history report pre-81

I got a Carfax once. It doesn't show everything, just the legally
required reportable things, like transfers, insurance salvaging, smog
inspections, etc. Salvaging is a mixed bucket. You can have a
perfectly good vehicle with a salvage title that might have just been
turned into a wrecking yard for a blown motor or couldn't pass smog.
On the other hand, you can have totalled cars that were uninsured and
were rebuilt without being reported to DMV.

 I'm just curious...What exactly does CarFax report and how does it know...?-(
 After a vehicle stops going to the dealer for scheduled maintainence or re-
 pairs how would it know what repairs or alterations an owner did either him-
 self or at a private garage...Other than accident reports, I can't see how it
 gets its info...
