Subject: RE: [T2] RE: Discount Tires (and Snows!) for Busses

&gt; I have a little question concerning the tire's price. In the 
&gt; ad it says &quot;including factory 14&quot; alloys&quot;. Do you tires come 
&gt; already mounted on rims? Does the price of 64.95$ include the 
&gt; rims? If so, is it possible to only buy the tires, and is the 
&gt; price different?


No, it is suitable for USE on all stock 14&quot; VW rims, including factory
alloys. The wheels themselves are not included.
