Subject: [T2] 1600 rocker question

If someone has a 1600 on the bench, would you check a clearance for me?

On a fully-closed valve, with adjustment screw all the way in except for 2-3 
threads, what maximum gap do you have between valve stem and screw?

Related question: anyone running longer-than-standard pushrods?  Or a 
cam/ratio rocker requiring non-stock pushrods?

Thanks,
Marv Krupp....bewildered as usual....
