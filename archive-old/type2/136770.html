Subject: Friday topic/rant: measuring tools

Dozens of jobs on our buses -- and every vehicle, for that matter -- 
require precise and accurate measurements using calipers, micrometers, 
and dial indicator set ups. Yet if you go into a NAPA or other FLAPS, 
or a Sears store, they are likely to be in short supply, not displayed, 
or &quot;we just sold the last one.&quot; And of course no micrometer standards 
with which to calibrate the things (I'm supposed to trust the dial 
caliper that costs $19.95, made in China? I don't think so.)

Given the sea of other tools you can get at these places, this makes 
absolutely no sense. I can't figure it out. I can't even come up with a 
conspiracy theory to explain it.

Mark &quot;is it in or out of spec?&quot; Hineline
