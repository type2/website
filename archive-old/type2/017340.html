&gt; &gt; &quot;When were the rotating passenger seats introduced?&quot;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; These seats (only in campers) were introduced in about '73-'74 as the internal unibody bracing was changed from a solid metal panel behind the front seats to a small triangle support bracked (which allowed the seat to swivel).
&gt;
&gt;          My '73 Westy sure doesn't have one. And if it did, it would rotate right into the cooler/sink. I thought those didn't come about until the Vanagon.
