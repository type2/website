Subject: first VW trip and camping.

just got back from my first long haul and camping adventure in my 70 westy...
the ride over and back went very smoothly, 50mph, and got 22mpg with a stock 
1600 s/p.
although just like [ jeremy_at_cowgar_dot_com ] said it is definately time for valve 
adjustment and oil.  i didnt get any &quot;idiot lights&quot; but right after i got 
home the bus was hard to start and running ruff. after it gets warm it runs 
smoother, yet still ruff for another couple of minutes.  it really isnt that 
bad at all but still im doing the valves with in the next week and see what 
happens.
campingwise the bus westy was excellent!  plenty of room for me, 2 others and 
all our stuff.  we slept 1 in the pop top hammock and 2 in the fold out bed.  
i was very happy with the campability of the bus.

-- oh yeah-- a good emergency way to fix the hammock in the pop top is to cut 
the bottom off of pillow cases and slide them over the poles.  if you triple 
them up, they can hold just about any one who can fit up there.
