Subject: Valves

I just purchased a set of AVP heads a few months ago (June).  I've been
running them since July.  I have already dropped the engine again for the 3000
mile retorque.

Now I tried to adjust the valves and the #1 valve was tight with the
adjustment screw all the way backed out???  I took the rocker arm off and the
#1 valve on far right (exhaust??) was noticeably longer than the other one.
Maybe a 1/4 inch or more.  We sanded down the rocker arm to allow for
adjusting screws to be used but now there is a tapping on that side of the
engine.  Any ideas what might be wrong?  I am hoping not a dropped valve
seat...

Thanks in advance..

Peace brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
