X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL - A

Today driving up to L.A. from San Diego, and at between 57 &amp; 62 mph my 71s
VDO-CHT *attached to the # 3 spark plug* read 350 degrees most of the time,
with an oil pressure of approx. 42 psi, RPM of between  3000 to 3100, oil
temp between 200 to 210, outside temp between 80 - 85 degrees.  Using
Kendall high performance 40 wt, and an almost completely stock 1600 dual
port * with the heat riser shields installed, Tommy*  This engine has about
26,000 miles on it, and I  assume it has been running this way for most of
those miles since the PO had the engine put in.  Do you honestly think/know
that a CHT of 350 degrees is too high?

&gt; &gt;&gt; Why is it that the vdo head temp goes to 600 (!!!), and the oil temp
&gt; &gt;&gt; only to 250?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 'cause the head temps get a damn sight higher then oil temps...if your
oil
&gt; &gt; hits 400 degrees, it is very very very far beyond being useful in your
&gt; &gt; engine...
&gt;
&gt; If your heads hit 400 degrees you have a whole 'nother set of problems;
they
&gt; heat the valve seats to 350 degrees before they press them in, so 350
should
&gt; be enough to help your engine start to press them back out.
