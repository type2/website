Hi Jarret - 

Earlier, you wrote:

&gt;Looks like I'll be leaving humid Houston, TX for Lincoln sometime this
&gt;week.  I'll either be going up via US 59 and US 71 (the
&gt;Arkansas-Missouri route) ...

If you decide to head up US 59, stop in at Texas State Technical College
in Marshall and see us.  The Diesel/Heavy Equipment Program is located on
the North Campus across from the mall.  ('bout a mile north of I-20 on
59)  We'll feed ya coffee and do-nuts - gotta pass on the beer, tho'. 
Getting the Department Chair slobbering drunk is  _reely_  frowned on! 
8-D  Needless to say, if you're having any 'last minute glitches', our
shop and 'stuff' is at your disposal.
Safe trip!

Dave Barbieri
