Subject: 1962 van

Hello,

my nephew is looking at a 1962 VW &quot;double cab&quot; bus pickup.  Thats what
he has told me over the phone.  It it minus a tranny and needs a rebuild
but only has a little rust.  He can get it for about $100.  What body
styles did the bus have that year and what is the value once
rebuilt/restored of such a bus?

He is looking at a tranny in a 1960 van which is sitting in a swampy
area (not real bad either).  Could a tranny be partly in water and froze
1/2 the year and still be OK after 10-20 years?

Thanks in Advance
