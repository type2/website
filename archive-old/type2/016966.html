This part is known as the firewall tin.  You might wanna try to locate a
71 model part.  This would allow you to install a doghouse oil cooler,
which provides much better cooling.  It is somewhat hard to locate
(don't ask how I know).  It is a 1 year only part.  The doghouse uses an
independent exhaust vented through the firewall tin and stops the
problem of the dropped #3 exhaust valve.  I found a 68-70 ish bus
firewall tin and a 71 or later b*g tin. The bus tin has an extra piece
across the top to fill the larger space in a bus.  I then cut the &quot;exta&quot;
piece off the bus tin and welded it to the b*g tin.  Not real pretty but
should work.

Good Luck
