Hi Volks,

Well I've almost recovered from a very busy weekend, following an eventful
week...

Tuesday15th I had a phone call to tell me theres a problem with doing the RHD
conversion on my new T2 camper and when did I want to collect it. Agreed on
Thursday lunch time.

Wednesday morning on the way to work my FIAT 126 blew a bottom radiator hose,
overheated, and is on the sick list. good thing I'm picking up the new van or
I wouldn't be able to get to VANFEST.

Thursday sorted out camping stuff and food for the weekend and the display
stands I had to take to VANFEST.

Then I go to the importers and collect my NEW 1998 T2 (no, I don't know how to
import them into the USA), have to wait while they polish it and then I sign
the documents and its mine!

I get away at 2 o'clock and drive home [lost a hub cap on the way :-(]and, in
between giving neighbours guided tours of the camper, load up all the stuff
into the camper. By 7 o'clock I'm at the show ground and have to give more
guided tours of the bus before unloading the exhibition stands in order to
allow my self room to sleep in it!

Friday, hard work, setting up the stands, and doing lots of other stuff for
the show.

as the afternoon wore on Vans started to arrive - VANFEST is organised by the
Volkswagen Type 2 Owners Club so 90% of vehicles are VW Type 2s.
Six to midnight I was working on the gate taking the show fees during which
the longest gap between vehicles was 10 minuets - mostly a steady stream of
Vans keeping 6 of us busy.

Last years attendance was estimated at 2000 vans and 8000 people - this year
was 25% up - we almost ran out of space to put people!

Saturday my bus was in the display of Devon conversions. While I was working
on the club shop (boy were we busy - takings were double last year).

Saturday night more gate duty.

Sunday back on the shop, and Van on display.

Sunday was also the Show and Shine which is judged by those who enter. But we
also had a &quot;judges choice&quot; class and muggins was one of the judges. Except for
it being hot this was not an arduous task as it gave me the chance to have a
close look at some superb VW Vans. Splits, bays, Vanagons, Campers, panels,
fire engines - a difficult choice to make with a 73 Devon Camper loosing out
to a pristine 78 panel van beause its wing mirrors were a bit damaged at the
edges!

Had a look at list member Dave Horrigans van which he is restoring (outside
'finished' not a lot wrong inside) - this will soon be able to hold its own in
the Show and Shine.

Monday was a clearing up day (made very difficult by an overnight cot death
on-site of one of the organising teams' 6 month old baby) and I was home by
the evening, with the first camping trip in my camper over - it will soon have
600Km on the clock.

Tuesday took the Fiat to the garage and got the camper undersealed.
Wednesday back to work for a rest.

Thursday night updated the VANFEST web site so point your browsers at

Now whats in my diary for this weekend.....

Good luck
Bob
