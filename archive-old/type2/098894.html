&gt;A few weeks ago I asked you folks how the 79 muffler is suspended, as the muffler strap is listed as 75-78.

&gt;You all let me down.
&gt;
&gt;Anybody with a 79 wanna chime in? My muffler's flappin'

All the diagrams show a strap that loops over the right edge of the silencer just before the tail pipe existing on the right but there is a screw mount on the left side of the engine case.  My eliminator exhaust hooks up there so I imagined that the original always did and I always forget to check on this when I visit the junkyard.

The Bus Boys catalog says that the strap connects the muffler to the crossover pipe which means the weight of the whole system is still being bourne by the the heater boxes alone. Karl!

ETKA says the 75-78 strap is 021 251 521
The 79 strap is 039 251 251 but some of the online catalogs list the 75-78 part number for 79.

Doing a search on the number reveals it's the same part as the 80-83 vanagon strap so since most of the 79-83 parts are the same (forgetting about California models and the heater boxes themselves), I think you can use that.  It still doesn't seem like a great way to suspend the original muffler.
