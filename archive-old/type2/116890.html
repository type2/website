Subject: Bentley maintenance specs

Muir has done me well keeping my 71 bus alive for the past 20 years, but 
since joining the mighty list, I've heeded it's advice and purchased a 
Bentley. In at least 3 maintenance aspects Bentley seems to be less 
demanding than Muir.
-Valve adjust, Muir 3k, Bentley 6k.
-Dwell, Bentley says that follow up checks are OK if in 42-58 degree range, 
Muir implies 47-53 OK.
-CV repack, Muir 15k, Bentley 30k.
Anyone know any good reason to not go w the Bentley specs?
Anyone know of other schedule diffs in the two pubs?
Thanks
Denny Johnson
