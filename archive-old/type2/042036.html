Subject: Re: Gas filler leak

The rubber filler elbow can easily be reached thru the round hatch that gives
access on the right side of the engine compartment (in '74-79's not sure about
others) with the engine in. I did mine without removing the CPU, but have been
told it is easier with it out (I just hate unplugging and replugging all those
pins).
