Subject: wiring success &amp; Bus Boys

     Ok, it actually worked!  I picked up a used flasher &amp; emergency relay 
     from a '64 parts bus, taking two inches of color coded wiring from 
     each, went back to the house where I installed those in Lea's '63 and 
     following the schematic in the Bentley I wired it all up in about 2 
     hours, rerouting and cleaning as I went along.  Everything electrical 
     now works on this vehicle!  Amazing.  
     
     We also installed and wired the 6 volt oil temp gauge that we got from 
     Bus Boys last week.  It works and looks great.  I posted a brief 
     message last week about my experiences with Bus Boys and because of 
     the recent barrage of negative posts regarding their non-catalog I 
     felt I wanted to say it again.  If I had paid to receive a catalog and 
     never got it, I too would be upset.  But if you're not doing business 
     with them because they dont publish a catalog, it's really your loss.  
     They are knowledgable, friendly, willling to talk and help, and have 
     everything I've asked for (for the '63 6 volt even) in stock and ship 
     promptly.  What more could you ask for?  Yes I buy from other places 
     as well and I appreciate the RMMW catalog also and have spent 
     thousands of dollars with them in the last two years, literally.  I 
     bought my GEX motor thru them!  But I wish they'd specified that the 
     front wheel bearings I just purchased were Chinese.  And when I tried 
     to buy tie-rods last week they were out of stock and couldn't tell me 
     when they might have them.  Bill at Bus Boys had them and shipped 
     them.  I don't really prefer one place over the other.  I'm just 
     saying that to blast or boycott a company just because they don't have 
     a pretty catalog for your collection is silly. Most of the time you 
     know what you want.  Pick up the phone, call the 800 # and ask!  Rant 
     over.  I promise I won't do it again.
