Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Pressure Gauge 

on 5/13/04 16:44, Sage Green related:

&gt; I received this hint from a listee vai P-Mail.  I wish I could remember who
&gt; it was.
&gt; 
&gt; Hint:  Use a water pressure gauge from Sears at $7 vice a fuel pressure
&gt; gauge from anywhere at $30+.
&gt; 
&gt; The water pressure gauge goes to 100 psi instead of the optimal 60 psi, but
&gt; it is adequate to measure the FI fuel pressure.
&gt; 
&gt; It is available in most hardware where the sump pumps are sold.  Sears and
&gt; Home Depot had the same gauge, but Sears was cheaper, much cheaper.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, the H2O pressure gauge comes in both a 1/4&quot; and a 1/8&quot; nipple so you
&gt; only need a piece of FI hose to go from the H2O gauge to the fuel rail.

barry,

you method works well.

for those who don't want to deal with finding the parts etc, we have done it
for you already, with our quality fuel pressure gauge kit. i designed this
simple kit myself and we use them on our own busses. it uses a permanently
crimped hose on one end and a reconditioned genuine FI clamp on the other.
