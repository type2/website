&gt; Just to clarify the photo was the setup that I thought was correct but

I thought so. That pic looks like both hoses are hooked to ported
vacuum, so the same pressure applied to both sides of the dizzy equals
zero movement of the diaphram.

I always run the retard side of the dizzy to manifold vacuum on the
nipple on the intake manifold.
