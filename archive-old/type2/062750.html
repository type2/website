Subject: Re: Where to put radio in '66

&gt;The obvious place is under the dash, above the parcel tray, but I'd like to
&gt;hear some other, less obvious ideas.

I once met this dude that made an interesting case for his radio that bolted to the side of his walk-thru seat(Pointing straight up!).  He  said it made it easy to reach while driving, but I wasn't convinced.  I say duck tape the sucker to the top of the dash.
