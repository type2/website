Gentlepersons-
                       Checked out the Kaleco site, but still no 12 inch 
diameter exhaust tips
for my type 2...Anyone know of a source? Feeling &quot;outgunned&quot; by the local 
riceburners.
                       Question 2: Anyone else have any success fitting a 
type 2 sliding door to
their VW-Bentley shooting brake? I'd like to fit one to facilitate cargo 
loading.
