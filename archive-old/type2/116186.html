Subject: Brake Booster Line...

Hey guys...

	Quick question about the brake booster. When I was inspecting the
lines this weekend, I noticed that in a few places, the brake booster line
has some rust on it. The Bus has VERY VERY little rust to begin with, but
only a few isolated spots underneath. Just surface rust really.. but on the
steel brake line.. it appears as if it's beginnign to scale a little bit.

With that in mind, I was considering replacing it. I want the Bus to be
functional, AND original looking, but I don't mind so much about changing
things &quot;under the hood&quot; since the Bus doesn't have the original motor
anyway.

That said, is it required that I have a specific diameter of line going from
the carburetor to the brake booster? 

Or can I use.. say a large steel fuel line most of the way?


Other than that... the brakes work pretty decent.

Thanks!
