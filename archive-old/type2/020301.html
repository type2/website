Subject: [T2]BugPak ignitions? Good?,Bad?

hi, I have a 1971 westy with a 1600dp,dual webers,009,etc and was
wondering if you guys out there have any input as to wether the jacobs
electronics &quot;Bug Pak&quot; is worht the 240$ or so that it costs.  It has a
money back guarantee promising several nice things, elimination of poor
idle,smoother acc.,more power etc.  Does anyone have one? do you like
it? also i was planning on adding a pertronix ignitor to my
distributor--will these go hand in hand or will it be redundant? thanks
in advance for any info.
