&gt; Someone tried to break into my bus last night.  (Not like I keep

&gt; inside.  They pried up the louvered windows and tried to stick their
&gt; hand through the window screen.  They ripped the screen, but it is not
&gt; easily patched because they ripped it where it connects to its frame.
&gt; My first question is: is this reparable?

Kyle,

I can't help with the alarm, but i can help with the screen.  If the frame
is not kinked, replacing the screen wire is a doddle.  Take a look at:
http://www.hgtv_dot_com/HGTV/project/0,1158,BDRE_project_10685,00.html
for the basic instructions.  The only mod I would make to their procedure
is that I would keep the spline until you have new spline of the same
diameter in hand.  I could not find any of that diameter local to me,
others have, but YMM definitly V!  The old spline can be reused, I have.
