Subject: Pacesetter muffler

about 2 weeks ago I put a pacesetter muffler on my 78 2l (got it from Ron
at Bus Depot but this is not about his service which was fine).

it went on like a charm, everything lined up, knew right then something
wasn't right.

today I had to get some welding done on another part of the exhaust
system, and while under there grabbed the tailpipe (not very hard) and it
broke off!!  it wasn't the weld either but the metal of the end of the
muffler just cracked!

well got that welded back up but certainly leaves me wondering how many
DAYS this muffler is gonna last.  

Hey Ron is there anything better actually avaliable?????
