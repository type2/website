Subject: Brake Line Question

I am getting ready to purchase new brake lines for the '54 -
the solid lines, not the rubber ones.

Someone told me that you can get these at a FLAPS, like NAPA,
but I wonder if those really would be the correct lines.

Also, what tools are needed for this operation, or is it possible to
buy the coorect ones already done up?

Anyone have any docs listing what pieces are needed, what sizes/
diameters, etc?

Thom
