Subject: air vents

68  Kombi

     I am looking for replacement round, dashboard air vents for a 68 =
bus.  The ones I have are cracked and feel like old dried up play dough. =
 I would prefer replacements made of modern plastic.  Original  factory =
equipment is not important to me.   I have looked through many on line =
vendors and have not found these yet.  Does anyone out there know of a =
supplier?
