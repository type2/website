Subject: Re: 84' seats in 77' bus?

BTDT, love the results.  The short answer is yes, it can be done.  The long
answer is that it's a bit of work.

The driver's seat will slide right in.  The passenger seat requires that you
install the Vanagon seat tracks.  This is not as bad as it sounds.  What you
have to do is take your battery powered drill motor and drill out the spot
welds on the donor vanagon.  You also have to drill out the spot welds on the
bus seat hardware.  Put the seat tracks on the seat, position it (make sure
that you can close the door with the armrest on the seat!) and tack it down. 
Remove the seat and rosette weld where you have drilled and paint it up. 
Grease the track and slide the seat in.

Did it four or so years ago and the results are worth every second of the
labor required to make the change.  The seats provide MUCH better support and
the arm rests are a godsend on long trips.  I'll take a couple of pics and
send them to you.
