Subject: Re: [T2] Oil cooler

&gt;I have another question to ask.   My oil cooler leaks and i want to 
&gt;replace it.  Is can you replace it without haveing to take the whole engin 
&gt;out? The engin is a 74 1800cc. Thanks everyone.

It can be done with the engine in but it's as much work with the engine in 
as the engine out. I just pull then engine and save all the cussing for 
another time.
