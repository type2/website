Subject: Re: tee shirts...

        I'm with Christian, oughta spring for a shirt for Richard
Palmer next go-round. 'Cept someone will probably write in at
the last minute and order JUST ONE MORE and Richard will let
it go... such a nice guy. Maybe the solution is to MAKE Richard
a tee shirt which ISN'T like the ones he makes, so someone doesn't
ask for it? :) Who shaves the barber, etc.
