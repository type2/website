Subject: RE: [T2] Things that DON'T WORK

here in the north, (quebec,Canada) we have frosty falls and spring day!!

Weve tried many heater for sleeping and driving.

While driving, we use a small propane catalytic plug to a 20 pound propane
tank to the back (with an extension and adapter.  We put the heater just
between the two seats.

Another thing that work great is the BN4, but while driving we plug a PVC pipe
as an extension to throw the heat in the front cabin, not in the back (we plug
the pipe in the heat outlet in the back Z-bed)

We also close the rear side with curtain and plastic, so all the heat stay in
the front cabin (OR IN THE REAR IF YOUR SLEEPIN), we have worn cargo door seal
so lots of air come through the cargo door while driving.

The next best thing we use  for sleeping by cold night is an old catalytic
heater as this one:

or the red one:

in fact we have both of them and we prefer the red one!!  Those thing are
cheap to find in Flea market (a found a new one for  10$ CAD), they are
economical to run ...we fill the heater , it run all night and still have half
of the tank in the morning... safe, no open flame, not noisy at all you cant
hear anything when they run... and even at 20 F outside you keep the inside
real warm (we close the pop top).

the only drawback is to leave open a small windows not been intoxicated, but
propane catalyticc has the same problem!!

when we want real heat in the morning, BN4 do the job!!

&gt; I recently took a little trip to the east coast and discovered this through
&gt; trial and error. Cabin temp was 36 F on the way up after 4-5 hours of
&gt; sleeping with the heater running and 46 F on the return trip sleep over...
&gt;
&gt; So, I suggest getting a heater with at least 3000 BTU heating capacity if
&gt; you want to be comfortable in cold weather bus camping. (Coleman Black Cat
_at_
&gt; $50)

Even the 3000BTU heater is marginal.  In electric terms it is about 800W,
a bit less than a cheap blow dryer.
