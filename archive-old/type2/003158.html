I do business with Bus Depot, RMMW, and many other companies.  But, I do SO
MUCH business with RMMW, I went through the trouble to be set up as a
vendor, and thus get things for friends side work, etc...

Sure their may be a price for lifetime warranty.  But, I will tell you, I
have always been refunded or replaced, no questions asked, period.  Account
credit, or credit to my debit card whichever I prefer.  I just returned a
carpet kit to them I had for 1 1/2 years and never used.  No problem, happy
to credit my account.

One other thing I have to say about RMMW that no other place comes close to:
Parts in stock, and timely delivery.  When they say it is shipping today, IT
IS.  I get things quicker from RMMW than anywhere.  Sometimes that is a huge
factor I decide to pay a little more and get it promptly.  With a lot of
other outfits, they use the shipping when they get around to your order
method. I know with RMMW my stuff will be at my door when they say it will,
generally quicker.   I applaud their commitment to customer satisfaction and
speedy service.

One time about 6 months ago, I order a left side floor pan for a ghia.  It
was out of stock, and they told me they expected it in the following
Wednesday.   Since I was staging the job at this point, I said, go ahead and
send it then.  Guess what.....I got it second day aired for free from them.
I did not ask for that, but their customer service expedited my backordered
item...at their cost.   Wow.

&gt; &gt; Prices may be steep, but everything comes with a lifetime
&gt; &gt; warranty, which I am unable to find elsewhere....
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; And how much are you really paying for that lifetime warranty?
&gt;
&gt; A &quot;lifetime warranty&quot; can be an effective marketing tool that obscures the
&gt; real issues of price and quality.
&gt; But it is no substitute for parts quality.  And neither is it free.
&gt;
&gt; The price you pay must be significantly higher to fund that &quot;lifetime
&gt; warranty.&quot;  Essentially, you are buying &quot;insurance&quot; or an &quot;extended
&gt; warranty&quot; with your part, built right into the price that you pay.  If you
&gt; are getting a like quality part, and actually make use of the lifetime
&gt; warranty, then maybe it was worth it.  (Consider the limitations and costs
&gt; of using it, though: see below.)  If not, then it wasn't.  Are you the
type
&gt; who always says &quot;yes&quot; to the &quot;extended warranty&quot; at Circuit City on every
&gt; piece of electronics, computer gear, appliance, etc. that you buy?  Then
&gt; maybe paying a lot more for a &quot;lifetime warranty&quot; is worth it to you.
This
&gt; is exactly the same thing, except that rather than being broken out as a
&gt; separate charge as it is at an electronics store, it is hidden in the
price
&gt; so you don't know what it is costing you.
&gt;
&gt; But wait, some prices do not appear to be significantly higher?  Why?
&gt;
&gt; Because rather than fund your &quot;free warranty&quot; by charging a lot more for
&gt; that part, the vendor has simply substituted a lower quality part for
about
&gt; the same price.  This is what happens much of the time, and is the real
risk
&gt; in my opinion.  U.S. made resurfaced brake shoes for the same price you
&gt; could have paid for brand new German ones.  Aftermarket Brazilian body
&gt; rubber for the same price as genuine VW seals.  Brazilian or Mexican
&gt; mufflers for the same price as German ones.  And so on.
&gt;
&gt; So for the same money, you have received a part that will very possibly
wear
&gt; out notably sooner (and perhaps not fit as well either).  But wait, you
have
&gt; a lifetime warranty!  When that inferior part fails, you can simply get it
&gt; replaced for free, right?
&gt;
&gt; Okay, say the Brand-X wheel bearing that you bought wears out (much sooner
&gt; than an OEM one might have, of course).  You now have to take the time and
&gt; hassle (or pay someone $50/hour) to remove the bad $10 part, and then pay
&gt; shipping _both directions_ to have it replaced (since the lifetime
warranty
&gt; does not include shipping).  Then you have to hope that the vendor will
give
&gt; you a break, because technically the lifetime warranty does not cover wear
&gt; and tear, just manufacturing defects; that is, if the cheaper part just
&gt; plain wears out, that's not covered..  Since this $10 Chinese wheel
bearing
&gt; probably wholesaled for $1.50, the vendor probably will give you the
benefit
&gt; of the doubt and replace it for you, given that the biggest expense was
the
&gt; shipping cost both ways, which you paid.  So you'll get another Chinese
&gt; wheel bearing, which may do the same thing.
&gt;
&gt; More likely, when the bearing fails you won't have the luxury of being
able
&gt; to wait for a replacement, or will simply decide that the time/hassle of
&gt; returning it isn't worth it.  So you'll go pick one up at Napa for more
&gt; money, and never even use the &quot;lifetime warranty.&quot;  This is part of what
&gt; they're expecting.  It's sort of like how companies that offer mail-in
&gt; rebates know that a certain percentage of people will never claim it,
which
&gt; is why they run a $10 mail-in rebate rather than just taking $10 off the
&gt; price.
&gt;
&gt; The same scenario could apply to many of the other parts - i.e. the
&gt; time/hassle of removing your window to send back a seal that is starting
to
&gt; develop cracks (whereas if you'd used the genuine VW seal it probably
&gt; wouldn't have cracked in the first place).  Or the time/hassle of removing
&gt; and reinstalling your exhaust system each time the Taiwanese or Mexican
&gt; muffler rusts through. I have a couple of customers who exchanged a
&gt; &quot;lifetime warranted&quot; Taiwanese exhaust system three times in three years,
&gt; before giving up, throwing it out, and plunking down $100 for my German
one,
&gt; which they should have done in the first place.
&gt;
&gt; Of course, this doesn't take into account the possibility that the part
may
&gt; fail at a very inconvenient time, such as when you're on your way to work,
&gt; or when you're 500 miles away on vacation.   And it doesn't take into
&gt; account the issue of safety, depending on what the part is and what could
&gt; happen if it failed catostrophically.
&gt;
&gt; What I'm trying to say is that a lifetime warranty is a good thing IF ALL
&gt; OTHER THINGS ARE EQUAL.  But you will rarely find that such is the case.
In
&gt; the vast majority of cases, you will either get lower-end parts for the
same
&gt; price, or pay notably more for like-quality parts.  Nothing is free.  So
you
&gt; need to consider how much you are really paying for that warranty, plus
the
&gt; time/hassle/expense of availing yourself of it, versus what it would cost
&gt; you to simply buy a premium quality part with the standard factory
warranty.
&gt; No decision is fool-proof. You could buy the proper German part with the
&gt; factory warranty, and you could just happen to get the one in a million
that
&gt; fails just out of warranty. But what are your odds, versus your costs?
&gt;
&gt; By the way, please don't construe this as an attack on Motorworks. I
changed
&gt; the subject of the thread to avoid this implication. My comments are
generic
&gt; in nature and apply to any number of retailers.  I am also not saying that
&gt; Motorworks or anyone else sells bad parts, etc. I am simply not a fan of
&gt; &quot;lifetime warranties&quot; in general, for the reasons I outlined above.  To me
&gt; it's all about price and quality, not gimmicks.
&gt;
&gt; It's your money and your decision.  Be an informed consumer.
