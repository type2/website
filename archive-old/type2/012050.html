Hi Brian,

I installed my VDO oil pressure and a separate oil
temperature gage where the VW pressure switch was.  I
had to rig up a pipe (manifold) with a metric &quot;NPT&quot;
threaded end to go into the block and a couple of
&quot;block&quot; fittings that allow a gage to be mounted to
the side while maintaining a through path for the oil.
 I used teflon tape on the threads going into the
block so the side gages ended up pointing away from
the distributor.  It works, but it took a little while
to get it to seal right and still not interfere with
the distributor.  If you go this route, remember to
support this pipe well when adding or removing the
side gages so you don't stress the fitting going into
the block.  I ended up with the original VW oil switch
(side mounted), an oil temperature sender (side
mounted), and the VDO gage sender in line at the end
of the pipe away from block.

You can calibrate your pressure gages before they are
mounted by rigging an air hose to an extra tire.  I
found my VDO readout gage (not the sender) was in
error, and got a replacement from Bus Depot.  You can
also calibrate yout oil temperature gage by using
boiling water.  Mounting the gages where the VW oil
switch was, in my opinion, is good enough because as
you read these gages over time, you will calibrate
yourself on how to interpret their readings.  In other
words. that may not be the perfect spot, but you will
learn how to interpret the readings of oil
temperature, and oil pressure.  By the way, I don't
know anyone who can use the VDO oil switch (on their
dual sender), because nearly all VWs have poor (low)
hot idle oil pressure.  The VDO switch comes on around
10 psi, so the oil light would be on all the time. 
The original VW switch is down around 4.5 psi, and if
you're lucky your VW hot idle oil pressure will be
above that.
