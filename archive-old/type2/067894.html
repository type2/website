Subject: 76 - 79 Westfalia Upper Cabinet and back Side cabinet FS

Both are in excellent shape
Upper cabinet is in excellent shape, it does have a one inch round sticker
on it that is a pot leaf that says end prohibition.  Should come off though.

Back cabinet is mint.  Has three small compartments and area for hanging
cloths.

Reasonable bids plus postage or pick up in the Md, D.C. 
N. Va area. If in N. Va I have a soccer game there this Sunday.

I also have an opportunity to obtain a folding bed green plaid, it works but
is worn but there is upper bed material available and a cooler for the
same year which is all there but the top wood doesn't look great. There
are also two front seats that are decent.  Let me know if you are
interested and I will see if they are available at a reasonable price.
