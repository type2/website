Our 1965 Westy has the big top tent, and roof rack to carry it. We have
talked with the original owners, and that is the way it came from Germany.
They drove it off the ship in New York. Came with the brochure showing the
tent too.  I think it is about time the date gets purhed back to '65 for
that style tent.      Jim

sorry- what date are you referring to and where do you want it pushed from
where?   My 65  came with the tent that attached to the bracket that are
permanently bolted to the roof of the bus and also to the bumpers, although it
is no longer with the bus.   If anyone has an extra, I am interested.   There
is a later style of Westy tent that is also large, but is a free standing
version, which has a beading edge to slide into an aluminium thingy that is
screwed to the rain gutter above the side cargo doors.     I have seen the
free standing version on 66 and 67 westys.
