Subject: Microbus (was heater duct)


Ok, lets clear this one up a bit.

The microbus was produced as a 7? seater with windows.

Definately in the European market anyway.
My bus Spooky, was a microbus, converted to a camper by Devon.
It says microbus (well the numeric equivalent) on the manufacturers plate 
which as I remember is the number 2.
Vans were 1 and Kombi's were 3 (I think).
Whatever ALL microbuses were fitted with the vent between the seats as they 
were the only buses built with the walkthrough and the factory fitted 'flat' 
side windows.
The van and Kombi had no passenger/load cabin heater ducting at all, the 
microbus also had the rear passenger cabin heater outlets (as seen on my 
site) which were ommitted from the van and kombi.

Another nice item is the fresh air vent/armrest that runs along the cab 
doors that also indicates a microbus.

Phew....I would be interested to know that this is the same in the US.
