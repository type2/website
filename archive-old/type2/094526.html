chevy has always gone after any commercial use of the bowtie (other 
than their own). that is one emblem they have been very picky about.  
one flaps i worked at had a recall to warehouse of some bowtie muffler 
ends one time.  we got a call from an administrative area asking if we 
had made absolutely sure nothing was left.  vendor was recalling all 
product in an emergency.  only the bowties were effected in that 
recall. wonder why?? somebody probably blew the licensing side.

BTW the emblem on the front of my vanagon now resembles some mountain 
peaks as well.

&gt; The incident involved hub caps with the &quot;bow tie&quot; emblem on it.

&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt; As I heard it stated,, VW has turned the industry upside down in a 
&gt;&gt; nasty
&gt;&gt; turmoil... so he decided to turn his emblem upside down,,,
