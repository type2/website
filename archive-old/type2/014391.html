&gt; &gt; &gt; Timing lights are real cheap since VW folks are the only market for them.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If you know a pawn shop that has a Snap On timing light for $20, please
&gt; &gt; let me know the phone #!!!!  I will call right now to buy it!  A quick
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; perfectly adequate.  I have one and have been using it for a year or two.
&gt; &gt; The pickup is held together with duct tape, as I keep busting it up, but
&gt; &gt; it tapes rather well and keeps on flashing.  When the bulb goes, I will
&gt; &gt; toss it and buy another.
&gt;
&gt; I have an old timing light, don't even remember the name but I got it for
&gt; one of my first VW's I know it has to be at least 25 years old.  those
&gt; things just keep on working.


They do seem to be long-lasting, if you take care of them.  Both my
tach/dwell meter and timing light are from Heathkit, which means that I
put them together myself.  That was many moons ago, and Heathkit is no
more.  The neat thing is that the Heathkit manuals also include detailed
troubleshooting instructions that allow me to fix the gadgets if they
ever need it.

I have a feeling that Muir got the idea for the idiot book from Heathkit
manuals.  The procedure style is certainly the same!
