&gt; Granted, 70 watts per low beam pair is max. Nothing is said about
&gt; fog light wattage.
&gt; But the original poster was saying that there is a max limit of
&gt; the total of wattage.

You're absolutely right, Karl. My apologies. I was so in search of answers I
lost track of the question. Thanks for getting me back on track.

Merry Christmas!
