Subject: Response to condolences

My dad passed on last Sunday afternoon at the age of 81. He had prostate
cancer (guys, get it checked). He kept his spirits and sense of humor
almost to the end and didn't linger long in a coma. It was very peaceful
and dignified. He was at home with loved ones.

My mom and I want to thank everyone from The List for their condolences,
well-wishing, good thoughts, and prayers. The support has been wonderful
and very much appreciated.

Back at Thanksgiving my mom rhetorically asked, &quot;What am I going to do
after this is all done?&quot; We were sitting in my bus at the time, and I
told her, &quot;Get one of these and go VIZZtin'!&quot; After seeing how
responsive the bus community has been, not only now but after I hit that
deer in Texas in October, she *really* wants a bus! :-) Accept no
substitutes! They always loved to travel, and she's always admired my
ability to just hit the road.

Our family used to ride touring motorcycles and we would go on rallies
-- like Jerome -- and road trips. My dad was really happy that I'd
hooked up with that kind of community when I got my bus. He said my bus
was something I &quot;could wrap [my] mind around.&quot;

So, again, thank you.

Nikki
