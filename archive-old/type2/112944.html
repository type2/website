Subject: Re: [T2] sick of points

Interestingly enough, it seems like there are quite a few complaints
about Pertronix.  Now, that could be because the Pertronix have a higher
failure rate, or maybe there is just a small install base of compu-fire
on this list.  Either way, I'm going to switch over to the compu-fire
system.  I like the install and it doesn't require any gap adjustment.

VW busses have been in my family for the past 25 years and yeah, the
points have worked fine.  However, I'd like an upgrade, just like I did
with megasquirt.  There are issues either way you go, but I think that
the benefits are worth not having to deal with adjusting points and
checking dwell.  If worst comes to worst, I can always put the points
back in.  I'm willing to take that chance...

Mike

&gt; Rather than spending a lot of bucks on pointless ignition, why not just
&gt; put the points back into correct order?  I've driven a very long way on
&gt; points ignition.  The only maintainance I do is to put a dwell meter
&gt; across the coil every oil change to check the dwell.  I probably have to
&gt; make an adjustment every 15K or so.  The hassles I have had with points
&gt; have been far less then the hassles I had with a Pertronix that decided
&gt; to give up the ghost on the road.  When electronic ignitions go out,
&gt; there is no fixing them, you either replace them or go back to points.
