&gt;Hey All --
&gt;I have an electrical question for anyone who can help 

I saw a couple of other answers on this. You can't run 110V gear on 12V
without an inverter, but have you checked to see whether you've got a mains
hook up system on board? This is so when you get to your camp site you run
out a cable and get mains power. 

There's a lot of fridges which run mains/gas/battery. If your sockets are
for mains you'll need a separate system for a 12V fan.
