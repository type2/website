Subject: Re: [T2] Is this to hard for a beginner?

Hi Nigel, Barry, Rick, Chopper, Jason, Bob, Jim, Anthony and James...

I have one word for you all: THANKS
The bus doesn´t seem that hopeless to fix anymore after all the help.

Yes, I do mean electrical cabels and I think I have the tools for the job. I 
have repaired engines before but only on boats and never on cars, but I am 
shore that after a bit of practice it will come.
Right now I am just anchous to get started...
I know that I got 2 manuals with the car but I am not where the car is so I 
can´t check what manuals it was untill christmas day.
But I will get John Muir's book as soon as I can.

I live in Stockholm in Sweden and we are having a lot of problem with rust 
here so I am very happy to have found a bus with little rust.

Thanks again for the answers and now I have some follow up questions:

1. How heavy is the engine(sorry, I don´t know what type it is at the 
moment)
2. What things should I do before I put the engine back in?
3. Where do I learn how to read a electrical diagram?
4. What is the most importent thing to check on my bus?
5. Is it comforteble to sleep in a vw-bus?
6. Does anyone know where I can get books for my buss in Sweden?

Marry Christmas!!
//Johan
