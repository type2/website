&gt; It is with considerable temerity that I rise to disagree with Karl about
the
&gt; sliding leaf extension being standard on the dinette table of the 74/75
&gt; Westfalia. Ours doesn't have it, nor does the Westfalia booklet that was
&gt; delivered with the van picture such a leaf. Now this van was delivered in
&gt; Europe, and though the booklet speaks of other Canadian equipment
&gt; differences and is in English, maybe they added the sliding leaf for
&gt; U.S.-only tastes.

Maybe a US feature?  Go here and scroll down to 74/75:

Look closely at the table. Under it is the leaf. The white spot under the
edge is the release button. It keeps the leaf from sliding out. It is spring
loaded. Push it in, slide leaf out, button pops into hole in leaf, leaf
stays out. All 74/75's I have seen in Calif. have that table. I even have an
extra one but it is missing the leg....;( [and 68-73 legs won't work, I have
those also ]


&gt; Isn't this great to have an argument about such important issues? Maybe
this
&gt; is a topic for tomorrow.
