Subject: Seat pedestal mat replacement alternative

Hi folks...

If you're like me, your Bus has worn out seat pedestal mats.  I was 
unable to find replacements to fit a Westfalia, so I decided to replace 
them with low-pile black carpet.

The stuff I used is the &quot;Universal Trunk Carpet&quot; from JC Whitney, which 
is really more of a felt-like material.  It's inexpensive, and looks 
pretty good.  It tacks down easily with contact cement.  One roll is 
enough to do both pedestals on a 76-79 Westy (well, it should be; I 
haven't done the driver side yet).

It's time consuming (took ~5 hours to do the passenger side pedestal 
today), but a lot of that time is waiting for the contact cement to 
tack up, compounded by having to glue it down in stages.

Here are some photos I took of the process.  Hope these are helpful to 
anyone else who is also unhappy with the state of their rubber mats.
