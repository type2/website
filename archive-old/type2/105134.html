Hella and Bosch are both good.  Cibie is also supposedly good, but I have
no experience with them.

Look for the European certification mark on the lens, and E with a circle
around it, IIRC.

If you use the standard 50/55 bulbs you do not need a relay.  They draw
the same current as the sealed beams.  If you run &quot;hot&quot; bulbs you will
need to add a relay to supply the extra current.
