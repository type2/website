&gt;3) Unrelated to the above:  when I removed the alternator, I could not find
&gt;   any way to undo the cooling &quot;boot&quot; from the fan.  I ended up just ripping
&gt;   the thing off.  The boot is attached to the alternator with a screw-driven
&gt;   clamp, but I couldn't find a way to access it.  How is this done, especially
&gt;   with the motor in the car?

Hopefully your the clamp was installed with the phillips head screw facing
down (DID  :-)  ).  Remove the under-the-motor cooling tin on the right
(FIF) side of the motor; you *may* have to remove the right-rear cooling
tin as well, but I don't think so.  Get under the car with a good light and
a *long* phillips head screwdriver.  Loosen the clamp, and pry the boot off
with a big flat head screwdriver or pick.  Should be fairly
straight-forward.

If the clamp was installed screw head up, you *may* be able to reach it
with a stubby phillips after the rest of the alternator has been loosened
enough to let you move the alternator around.
