Subject: Re: Aux solenoid/hot start fix article

&gt;&gt; Good points, all.  I think that the recommendation for the generic Ford
&gt;&gt; solenoid is due to the higher throughput amperage than that sustainable by
&gt;&gt; the Bosch relays.  In cold weather I would think that the starter could
&gt;&gt; pull =&gt; 50 amps.  Will the Bosch relay carry that kind of short term load? 
&gt;&gt; Anyone know the max starting amperage of a Vanagon starter? 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;Mine was not even a Bosch relay, it was an auxiliary light relay made by
&gt;NightBlaster or some such for their fog lights.  Rated to 30 amps.  It's
&gt;done well for me, but I must confess I installed it in summer and sold
&gt;the bus a week or so ago, so I don't know how it would do in the dead of
&gt;winter but it did great down to 20 F or so.  Hoover once told me when I
&gt;asked him about this that the draw was around 30 amps.  I think the
&gt;Bosch relay is only fused for 15 amps and I haven't heard of anybody
&gt;having problems.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;From an empirical standpoint, I've had the Ford relay in place for several 
&gt;&gt; years and the system hasn't hiccuped once.  I would think that if the Ford 
&gt;&gt; pulled the same activation current as the starter solenoid that I would 
&gt;&gt; have continued to have problems even after the modification.  Not trying 
&gt;&gt; to be contrary, just my observations.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;From what I gather, it's not exactly the same; it's less but it's not a
&gt;whole darn lot less.  The relay is a whole darn lot less :) .  Perhaps
&gt;Bob can give us more specific values to work with because I have no idea
&gt;:) .  The Ford solenoid hasn't given me any trouble but I've only had
&gt;the thing for a few weeks, we'll see how it holds up.  I jsut don't like
&gt;the idea of anything for a Ford on my VW -- Ford does not impress me :)
&gt;
&gt;

  Well I ain't Bob - 

 First the answer, cause I know you PHD's are busy.

 Get a relay with a rating for a continuous 30-40 amps and you're 
alright. Which means the headlight wampus is cool.

 The Bosch is rated at 35 amps  and the VW is rated at 30.

 Now the scary stuff: right out of my funky old Bentley.

 Horsepower: some are .7 and some are .8 hp

 No Load test - amps:  pooling 3 types, 25 to 50 amps. voltage 12v.

 Load test: 160 to 200 amps   Voltage pulled down to 9v.

 Stall torque test:  220 to 300 amps. Voltage pulled down to 6v.

 
 If you got this far, let me assure you that there is a big difference
between a &quot;continuous rating&quot; and a say &quot;30 second rating&quot;.

 The 30 amp continuous relay will handle the 180 average for the 30
second start with no problem.

 I think every manual I've ever read says crank for 10 seconds and
then let it cool off.

 Those admonishments also are for your starter.

 You have any idea how big a starter motor would be if it handled 
those amperages continuously? About the size of your whole engine.
