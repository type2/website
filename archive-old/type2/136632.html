&gt; &gt; Thanks for the reply.  I thought that there might be a EE out there that
&gt; &gt; could create a small circuit that might be able to do the trick and produce
&gt; &gt; a digital readout.
&gt;
&gt; If you look at the graph I made that Dave mentioned you can see that the
&gt; readings quickly approach an asymtote. You would see no difference in
&gt; reading from that sender when a CHT probe under the spark plug would read
&gt; differences between 300-400F.

Gentlesirs,

I hate to chime in on this, but I happen to be driving with one.  It works
just dandy, it's very responive, and I believe it has saved me many a
valve job.  The gauge was built by John Anderson on a lark from some plans
he'd gotten over on a 914 site.  I just went looking for the plans and
cannot find them with a quick google, but I will do more research later.
If I find the plan, I will post a URL.

The response curve on the sensor is indeed a curve, but many electronic
doohickies are (see: audio taper potentiometers) and it's relatively easy
to get around this apparent limitation.

The one I have in my '80 aircooled V'gon is based on the stock sender, a
run of wire, and the dash pod out of an '82 diesel.  The diesel dash pods
and the '83 wasser dash pods have the clock that was original to my '80
with a water temp sender built in.  The response curve on this gauge
matches the resistance change on the CHT thermistor very well, with a bit
of tweaking.  In this instance, the tweak is to install an LED inline as a
*very* small extra load.

I have my gauge run into a second sensor screwed into the matching hole on
the 1/2 head to the rear of and over cylinder #2.  I would *NOT* attempt
to tie the gauge in to the FI system, as the resistances at operating
temperature are very low and very critical to proper engine function, as
Richard found out.

NOTE:  The wasser temp gauges do not have any numbers on them, merely a
pair of bars marking good operating temperature and an LED that blinks
when the temp reaches some critical value (probably 212 originally).  We
tested the settup as Richard did before installation and the LED began to
blink at ~450 which I regard as ideal.  The sensor location is nowhere
near the valve seat that we are actually trying to protect and I believe
many degrees cooler.  I am guessing that the melting point of the head at
somewhere in the 6-700 degree range and tha the temp at the seat is too
damn close to that if the temp on the outside of the head is 450...  so
it's time to pull over!
