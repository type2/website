Jason,
you will find the engine runs better when you have the air intake filter
pieces in place,, especially the left one with the small hose installed as
well.

If this was installed you wouldn't see the blue flame shooting out the carb.

If you have a old/weak 90deg boot on the brake booster vacuum line, and
the engine backfires, it has a tendency to pop off,, leaving you with a
vacuum leak.
The engine will idle low, or not at all,, and will not rev up..

I would recommend you look for a loose hose or an open vac port on the
left side carb and intake manifold... then install your vac gauge to
ensure you have about 15&quot; vac,,
then use your dwell meter to set the points to 50 deg
then adjust the timing with your strobe light,,
and look at your vac gauge again,, see if it is a little higher.

clean up, smile, take a drive, smile, let it cool off, and start again,
this time, check the valve lash, check the compression, check the dwell,
check the timing, check the vac.

You can do all this in less than 10 minutes and is a valuable diagnostic
procedure to zone in on where your problem my be,, &lt;fingers crossed&gt; next
time you have a bit of trouble.

&gt; Dear list
&gt;
&gt;   I am trying to find out why my bus today won't go over 30 mph but
&gt; yesterday would.  all i did was replace the points which i checked 3 times
&gt; and have the correct gap.  I also noticed that the engine is backfiring a
&gt; little some popcorn sounds every once in a while.  Also when i noticed that
&gt; the right carb &quot;backfired&quot; a couple of times when i would give it a quick
&gt; press of the accelerator.
