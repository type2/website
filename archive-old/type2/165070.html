its been 25 years, so pardon the vernacular.  Out here, its called &quot;the
coast&quot;.  You say &quot;shore&quot; out here (and I have) and everyone looks at
you kinda funny.

Bus content:
I pulled the front carpets up for the first time since buying the bus 4
years ago and found a nice rusty, but solid floor.  Gave it a wash,
wire brush scrub, followed by some Naval Jelly.  Hosed out, Eastwood
Rust Encapsulator'd.  Should have taken a look sooner, but the PO had
screwed the carpet down.  Neat.  Great way to spend a Sunday afternoon,
though.  Beats sitting on the freeway trying to get home from the coast
:)
