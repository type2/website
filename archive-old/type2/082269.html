Hello All    When I was in Yellowstone I found it better to camp off the fire 
roads in the tetons. Nobody said anything about AAA or getting a Golden Eagle 
pass,I guess the national service still sell these one pass for all the 
national parks made camping outside the park and going back and forth cheaper 
and easier. Wish I was going again too!     Later Mark dearing salem Import
