Subject: Re: flaps, cooling, heat, flames

Since everybody is sparring I might add my 2 flaps worth.

I think Craig has some great ideas there. But...
even though his procedure is highly scientific and would get us
Teutonically precise information I think these arguments could be
settled quicker with proving a trend, rather than statistical volume.

Taking one bus, going through procedures A through D with same
test equipment should show a trend of how these mystical VW engine
components influence air flow, pressures, and temperatures within
one weekend. Taking two busses would make it even more convincing.

Isn't that what would satisfy most of us? Failing that, the only other
[reliable] source would be VW, except they might get you a lot more
than you bargained for and bury you with mountains of details.

Flaps closed

&gt;OK - you guys are NEVER gonna convince each other this way!!
&gt;As the late Mr Hoover once noted, the ONLY way to prove either viewpoint is
&gt;get SEVERAL buses set up IDENTICALLY
&gt;except for :
&gt;A) no flaps on one
&gt; B) no seal on one
&gt; C) no flaps, no seal
&gt;D) ALL flaps and seals.
&gt;Just for kix, have busses with seals but flaps closed, and no seals but
&gt;flaps open... and some with flaps REMOVED.
&gt;
&gt;Place manometers (and tufts, as Mr Lyle says) on them all to measure air
&gt;flow and pressure, and sprinkle CHT,
&gt;oil temp and pressure guages liberally.
&gt;
&gt;Drive IDENTICAL routes, conditions and styles for A YEAR.
&gt;
&gt;Then compare data.
&gt;
&gt;It may have occurred to someone out there that this has been done already
&gt;
&gt; - by VW.
