Brian,

By now you have received a number of replies to your questions. I am 
going to send one more, and cc to the list because part of my answer 
bears repeating.

First, on the matter of the camper, you may be able to find you that
resembles yours by checking the type2 website &lt;www.type2_dot_com&gt;. Click on
library, then campers. Hunt. 

As for the question about putting a diesel engine in the bus, the answer
is probably yes, you can do that. If you can put a big Ford engine in a
little bitty AC roadster, you can do anything. But why would you want to?
The type1/type2 motor (1600) is one of the most common motors in the
world. You'll be able to get parts for it until judgment day. It's easy
to work on, and it is reliable (as long as you don't catch it on fire).

If you buy it, keep it stock.

bus with stock engine)

199? Raleigh c30 MTB, de-MTBized and hanging off Peregrine's caboose
