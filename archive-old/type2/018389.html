     Can you get a CW crank for a T4? I haven't really looked for speed
parts lately, but there didn't seem to be much awhile back, not even
heavy duty oil pumps.
      Anyway, I had a fully CW crank with roller bearings on the rods
(one-piece rods) in a T1 engine years ago, it was pretty nice. Redlined
at 8000. The CW certainly would help, but by how much I don't know, as
the T4 engines seem to have a pretty tough lower end anyway, at least
compared to the T1's.
