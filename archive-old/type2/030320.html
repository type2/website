&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; I want to pull a 71 tranny without pulling motor can this be easily done?
&gt; Take off inner cv's?
&gt; Release rear shifter coupler?
&gt; Support motor of course.
&gt; Undo transmission mount?
&gt; 
&gt; Anything else i am missing?

Use cutting torch to get torsion bar housing out of the way!  :)

Unfortunately, I don't think that you can get the front tranny mount
disconnected without moving the engine back, which you can't do with the
moustache bar in place.
