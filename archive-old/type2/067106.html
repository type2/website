&lt;&lt;The reason you use a resistor with a coil is so that you cut down the 
voltage going into the primary windings. MY Datsun Z car has a nice 
cermaic resistor (external) below the coil. It knocks down the 
input voltage so 
the output woltage is not too high, and does not tear up the plugs or 
points as fast. When you first start up the Datsun Z, the starting switch 
bypasses this resistor and feeds the the full 12volts to the coil. This 
way early morning starts are not so hard. You could always put one of 
these external resistors on a coil without one.&gt;&gt;


The resistor brings the voltage down to the operating voltage of
the coil, maybe 9 Volts, when the starter motor turns the engine on a 
cold morning the actual voltage in the car's electrical system will drop. 
A 12 V coil would now have problems because it's not getting the input 
voltage it was designed for. The resistor is bypassed as long as the 
starter motor is engaged, thus ensuring proper voltage to the coil at all 
times.

Now, if you would put one of these resistors on a regular 12V coil (not a 
9V as they're usually used on)  you'd feed the coil less than the operating
voltage it was designed for and it would not alter the voltage during 
starting. (compared to what the coil would get without the resistance)

If you'd want a coil with a resistor like this your best buy would be the 
Bosch red coil, it is used on Porsche's and BMWs, so you might find one
of off a recent car in a junkyard. According to Bosch, it's their highest 
performance Coil.

I don't like the extra weight and the increased number of parts.

I personally think that the Bosch Blue coil (Bosch P#: 0 221 119 027) is 
the best suitable coil for the air cooled VW. The red coil might have 
higher RPM limits than the blue coil, but that would only be noticeable
above 8000 engine RPM, and my Bus rarely does that.

The rotor should always be a 5 Ohm, the newer (H2oVW) electronic 
ignitions sometimes use 1 Ohm rotors. (and preferably the RPM limiting
kind, they are expensive, but worth every penny.
