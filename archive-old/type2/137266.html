Subject: Tires  Hankook vs Continental?

My local tire guy (up here in the land of igloos &amp; dogsleds &lt;grin&gt;) 
tells me that the Hankook RA08 is no longer being made!  His take on 
it's availability south of 48 is that they are still carrying old 
stock.  He wants to sell me Continental &quot;P&quot;185's that are &quot;double 
reinforced&quot; and are listed as original equipment for a '74 Kombi.  He 
wants $132 Cdn for them which puts them a bit above the $70 US for the 
Hankooks.  Has anyone any opinions on Continentals vs Hankooks?
