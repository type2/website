&gt; I need one (1) Yokohama 370 LT195/75-R14 tire in good used condition.
&gt; Anybody have one laying around? I broke a radial on my last long road trip
&gt; and would hate to replace ALL the tires when only one is bad. Currently,
I'm
&gt; using my  P195/75 passenger tire spare in the front.
&gt;

Bob,

Do yourself a favor and buy two new Yokos, put them on the front or rear,
and use your extra Yoko as a spare. Periodically rotate your spare and your
used tires. You'll eventually have a set of 5 evenly worn tires that you can
rotate, and will have a matching spare for the road.

Cheers,

John
