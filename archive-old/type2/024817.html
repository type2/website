&gt; What is the best solution for this problem?
Monitor your cylinder head temperature.  350 degrees F is the start of the 
danger zone.  Heads are heated to 350 to press the seats in.  
Be sure your gauge/sending unit read accurately.
Mount the sending unit so it reads the head temp not the temp of a large stud.
