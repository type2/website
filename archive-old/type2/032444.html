&gt;&gt;if the shifter on a 72 bus suddenely stops shifting
what might be the problem? it's connected at the front
and also at the back, the coupler is intact and the
part that connects the rear shift arm to the gearbox&lt;&lt;


Chad,
Something similiar happened on my 75, it stopped shifting, and upon first glance everything seemed to be intact.  Then I had my wife sit in and shift gears while I laid underneath checking things out and noticed that even though the coupling toward the rear of the bus (Right in front of where things connect to the trans) was there and appeared fine, when the shifting was attempted the &quot;collar&quot; at the front of this coupling had come un-welded from the rest of the coupling, so when the linkage rotated, it turned that collar part, but the rest of the coupling stayed stationary, thus no shifting.  $10 to Motorworks for a new coupling and an hour of fighting to get the old one off and things wee as good as new!

Peace, John Baker
