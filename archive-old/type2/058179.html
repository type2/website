Subject: '68 to '76 Sliding Door Transplant-Will it Fit?

Hello All,
   I have a chance to buy a sliding door from a '68 bus to replace the rusted one on my '76 Westy. Question is, are they the same size, and is the hardware the same? I'm hoping someone out there has tried this before, and knows if it will fit or not. Same for the rear hatch door, are these interchangable as well? I also want to retain the crank out window in the slider, so is glass size the same as well? TIA, Jeff
