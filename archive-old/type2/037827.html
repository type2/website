Subject: 70' transmission for sale and other parts

I have a transmission from my 70' Bus for sale. Make me an offer. I am 
located in Belvidere, IL and i don't want to ship the trans. I also have many 
parts left from the 70 westy to sell still plus i just came upon a parts lot 
that i am going threw. So let me know your needs are. If there is anyone 
interested in the pop-top off the 70 let me know i will give it to you. Thanks
