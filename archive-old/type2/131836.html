Subject: Re: [T2] Painting wheels with POR

&quot;Powder coating is over rated IMO, I had my wheels blasted and coated and 
the&gt;rust showed through within a year.  Maybe the guy doing it cut corners, 
I
don't know&quot;

Cut corners?  Maybe...but it is more likely that he didn't chemically treat 
the wheels before coating them.  Physical removal of rust on a visually 
inspected basis is only half of the job.  On a molecular level, there is 
still oxidation at work.  Without a zinc treatment of some sort, the cancer 
will arise yet again!
