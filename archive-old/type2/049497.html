Subject: Re: [T2] cruise control for bus?

Here is my method - I call it the &quot;Redneck Cruise Control&quot;.

http://24.23.226.49/vw/bluto/rcc

As for safety concerns, I defer to the following:

1)  My brakes are so much more powerful than my engine when in 4th gear, I
doubt I'd notice any difference when braking.

2)  It only takes a slight movement of my leg to knock it off of the pedal.

&gt;[...]  I used to do that with my S*B*R*.  Just jam the long handled ice
&gt;scraper between the gas pedal and the seat, adjust seat forward or backward
&gt;to set desired speed, and relax!

&gt;&gt; Cruise control was easily achieved with a suitable brick.
