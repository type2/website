Subject: Re: [T2] INSIDE the aluminum basket case

hello everybody  From what I see in the pixs shows a loss of oil pressure. 
The cam bearings shouldn't be showing brass and the mains have way too much 
wear on them. The cam plug doesn't matter which way it goes in fact the 
factory would put it in backwards to show thw engine builder that that motor 
was for an automatic. Something tells me that the cam jornels are off. Later 
and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service Salem Va
