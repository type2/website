Here is the site for the Twin Cities Volkswagen Club:

http://www.twincitiesvwclub_dot_com/index.html

We meet on the first Wednesday of every month, except December and January, 
at West Side Volkswagen in Saint Louis Park, west side of Minneapolis.

I write the article called &quot;Type II Tak&quot; for the newsletter.

&gt; I am looking for a club in the Minneapolis area to become a member of.  If 
&gt;  any current members of established clubs could lend advice, I'd appreciate 
&gt;  it.
