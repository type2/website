hi volks, me again,
im going to be traveling across the us in my as yet unfinished rebuilt 72
westy with 'the wife' in september. i will be leaving miami, fl early sep
taking 2 weeks to get to ca (napa), a week there and 2 weeks back. i have
never done anything thing like this in my life and am looking forward to it
(read very nervous). anyone know of any good shows around in sep that i could
get to. or maybe a bus/club/campout meeting we could drop in on. i wanna make
this a vw vacation, you get the idea. weve never been west of florida so this
is gonna be an experience. any advise for a long trip would be most welcome.
all the besty. marty :)
