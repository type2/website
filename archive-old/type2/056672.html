Subject: Busted sway Bar(s)

........I have a slightly perplexing problem. Last fall, I did a
complete axle beam swap on my '79 Bus.Since then, I have broken two sway
bars on the front axle.Never broke one before this.I don't know if this
is simply coincidence, or a lingering possiblity that I did something
wrong when I did the axle beam 'surgery'.Any thoughts? I'd sure
appreciate any insight. Thanks!

                     ........anybody have a sway bar that they'd like to
part with cheap????????
