Subject: [T2] Emergency Help and Advice needed - Appleton, WI

&gt; was at an intersection at a full stop in Appleton, when I have to really
&gt;force it into first and suddenly when it took I heard a &quot;Ka-Chunk&quot; noise from
&gt;under the bus.  It seems the transmission is now locked into 3rd gear, and I
&gt;can't seem to release it no matter what I do.

Broken bracket inside the shifter front housing, $20 in dealer parts.

 &gt;1. Is this something I can work on myself (fairly easily) - releasing the
&gt;linkage somehow, or will I need to have a garage do this for me?
&gt;

Best to stand the trans on its bellhousing.
Details in the Bentley.

Dave
