It is with considerable temerity that I rise to disagree with Karl about the 
sliding leaf extension being standard on the dinette table of the 74/75 
Westfalia. Ours doesn't have it, nor does the Westfalia booklet that was 
delivered with the van picture such a leaf. Now this van was delivered in 
Europe, and though the booklet speaks of other Canadian equipment 
differences and is in English, maybe they added the sliding leaf for 
U.S.-only tastes.
Isn't this great to have an argument about such important issues? Maybe this 
is a topic for tomorrow.
Roland-definitely '75 Westy!
