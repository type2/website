Subject: Still pondering that horn...

Thanks to those who have contributed advice on my horn problem. However,
it's still not fixed and I still can't figure this out. Let me word my
question a different way.

I have a 72 bus that honks all the time (when the key is on). I decided I
would try to replace the ground wire that goes down the steering column.
Bob Hoover had a sermon that said it was relatively simple. However, my Bus
is apparently not the same as his. Here's why:

The steering shaft is a hollow shaft that is inside the steering tube,
another hollow shaft (tube inside a tube). The horn ground wire connects to
a spade connector at the steering wheel, then goes down the center of the
steering shaft (inner tube). However, I cannot see where it comes at the
bottom. The only connection I see at the bottom comes from a spade
connector on the inside of the steering tube (outer tube).

My question is, what happens to the wire between the time it enters the
inner tube and exits the outer tube? Or do I have it all wrong? I lay under
the bus all last Sunday pondering this. Help!

Thanks, all.
Jerry
