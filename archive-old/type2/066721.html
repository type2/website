Subject: Maggie Progress Report: Day 2

I know, I know, it's actually been two days since I posted, but yesterday I
didn't get to work on the bus.  So it's day 2.

In our last installment, you may recall, that I pulled the motor and bent
the studs in the process.  I have since found out that this is not the dire
situation I once thought, and a local listmember has even offered his tools
and expertise (Stefan Ufer--what a guy!).

Today I have discovered the reason behind the original problem (the fan not
turning).  I have pulled off the fan, which was bolted to some piece, which
fits over the crankshaft and is held in place by a key (this same set-up is
used in T1 engines to hold on the pulleys to the generator, I think, there
is a damn key somewhere on that generator).  This key in my bus was broken,
thus allowing the crankshaft to spin inside the said piece.  This key was
not merely broken, it was disintegrated, shattered, nothing left but very
small pieces.  BTW, I could surely have corrected this problem w/o pulling
the engine, more about this later.

A question:  Do you suppose there is something else wrong which caused that
key to shatter?  Or is it just a normal kind of thing to happen after 20
years (and countless miles) of life?

Anyway, calls to parts places go out tomorrow.  My credit card bill is
fortunately paid, because I am otherwise quite broke!

I must say that this is a very emotional experience: the first engine pull.
My bus and I are growing much closer in the process.  As I said before, I
didn't really need to pull the engine to do the repair (although I didn't
know it at the time), but I think it is an invaluble experience.  Plus I
needed to replace some seals anyway (in tranny and engine).

More as more comes available,
Eric
Maggie

BTW, for those of you trying to fit this picture in with your image of 1600
T1 engine, Maggie is a 76, with a 2.0l T4, fan in rear of the engine,
attached to the crankshaft and such.
