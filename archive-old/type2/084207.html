Subject: Re: SnakeOyls and comment on faith/science

Ah, did I see the word &quot;blinders&quot;?  I see the testimonial (faith over
science) purveyers are stepping beyond experience to comment on you (Dr
TIM) and not your opinion, a taboo in rational discussion.  As a
biologist/histologist steeped in &quot;repeatable research&quot;), I understand
too well that a factual result is to be accepted only when statistically
valid, requiring a well designed experiment to determine a causal
relationship from what you are testing.  In plain English, you gotta
vary one thing to enough samples to determine the positive/negative
effect of that one thing.  You gatta have repeatable results from
outside investigators.  Much easier on engines than people.  To believe
the testimony of single users and schizophrenics leads to snake oil and
the grief religious differences bring (hear O Israel, Christians, and
followers of Islam).  Testimonials alone are not bad; it is from them
that science often is spurred to separate out true cause and effect.
My having used TUFOIL and still running a 234,000 mi engine is
interesting, but I agree I'd need to see it used on at least 10 engines
with and 10 without all subjected to similar wear. The data TUFOIL
claims comes from testing on forklift warehouse machines, not the same
as cars, but a more closed/similar environment than cars.
My take on MMO is that it's a solvent diluted machine oil; not very
helpful in the function of oil, and questionably helpful in gas (where
its use is more remedial than preventative)- ie, you are trying to
restore the door after the horse has escaped).
