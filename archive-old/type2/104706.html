Subject: Need goog heads, pistons... (San diego area)

Hola gentlemen4s, i will be out of Baja and in the san diego area in 3 days 
(if i don4t break anything else!!!!!)

I want to purchase a few parts wile in am in the san diego area again!!!
I will check interstate VW parts on the 67 for used (good condition) / new 
head &amp; pistons to upgrade my tired 1.7, if you know anyone with rebuilt 1.8 
heads, pistons &amp; cylinders. I would also consider 2 good/new 1.7 heads as my 
oil consomption is 0!, am sure that i loose compression at the head matting 
surface and not at the rings.

I should be able to find at Interstate VW other parts like the sliding door 
lower bracket, a sliding door!!!, front shifter assembly and bushing.

Cheers, Ben
ps: please reply to my hotmail e-mail huotx(at)hotmail_dot_com
