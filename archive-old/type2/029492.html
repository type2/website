&gt; OK.  Time for the annual safety checkup.  Some of my previous encounters 
&gt; from just FOUR previous inspections

Am I glad I don't live in a state where this BS goes on.  They should just
call it the &quot;auto mechanic's relief act&quot; and be honest about it.

&gt; -  Failed  -  The light bulb over the license plate was burned out

Illuminated license plates are a safety item?  I thought those things were
reflectorized for a reason!
 
&gt; -  Failed  -  I had 'cat's eyes' covers over my headlights

Well, that's self-inflicted.  I bet they went right back on after the
inspection, though!

&gt; -  Failed  -  No light bulbs in the reflectors on the front door.

&lt;laughter&gt;  I don't think that any of the door reflectors ever had bulbs
in them.  The front turn signals served as the side marker lights.

&gt; -  Failed  -  No EGR filter (Yes, failed safety because the emission 
&gt; equipment was not stock.)

&gt; -  Failed  -  Muffler looked like it might be leaking

They all leak, from that tube at the left rear corner.  Not much that can
leak further forward!
 
&gt; -  Almost failed  -  Safety inspector needed help to find the EGR 'valve'.  
&gt; (He said it was on his checklist, and he needed to see it.  Obviously he 
&gt; should have been looking for the EGR filter, because the EGR valve is a 
&gt; little difficult to see/find.)

Errors like this crop up all the time in inspections.  The state comes up
with a list of all possible equipment and crosses off those items that
vehicle does not have.  If they forget to cross something off, then the
burden falls on the owner to prove that the vehicle didn't have that item
originally.  Innocent until proven guilty?  Not when car inspections are
concerned

&gt; -  Almost failed  -  Safety inspector needed to feel the air flow coming out 
&gt; of my windshield defroster vents.  (Give me a brake!!)

Well, you can feel it from mine, if the engine is anywhere above idle.  I
had to put in a lot of work to get the system right, though.

&gt; (I hope my windshield washer is not on the inspection list.  I might blow 
&gt; the inspectors mind as I pull the air hose into the passengers compartment 
&gt; to compress my windshield washer reservoir.)

That's one thing on my bus that has never worked!
