John Hartranft sends:

&gt; Not that I don't relish the thought of changing my tranny oil as often as
&gt; possible, but would our local lube expert please verify that I've got the
&gt; right stuff this time?  I put GL-5 in last time, time to drain it out, get
&gt; it right.  I've bought 3 qts of Sta-Lube Hypoid SAE 85W90 API/GL-4 (Part No.
&gt; SL24229 for what that's worth).  It looks right on the money to me (got it
&gt; from P*p B*oys), says it's not corrosive to bronze parts, but also says it's
&gt; OK for differentials requiring GL-3.  I suspect I'm being overcautious, but
&gt; how about a go/no go on this stuff?

Go. This is the stuff you want. (FWIW, I would have bought the gallon jug if
they had it; the Pep Boys in Fayetteville, NC, charges less for a gallon
than for three quarts.)

&gt; Lovely thought:  it also causes cancer in California.  I'll be careful.

Everything causes cancer in California, John. It's one of the side benefits
of living there.
