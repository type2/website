Well I do KNOW that mine have a vacuum port. Now what I cannot say is
how that vacuum signal will perform on a type 4 engine. Now that I
think about it, both carbs have a vacuum connection. The passenger
side one has a different signal style than the other. If you pick up
the set, please report to the list on how they perform.
