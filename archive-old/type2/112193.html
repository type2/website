Subject: Bench testing FI engine

 I have an engine stand made just for building, and
breakin in engines. But it also gets used on
used/unknown engines to check compression, leaks,
ect... 
 What were wanting to do is put the FI GE 2L on it to
fire it up (po said it aint been started since pulled
in '80 or so). You can still turn it by hand, abeit
difficult from compression, but at least it aint froze
up. But instead of installing it in the bus just to
find it has to come back out (oil leak, bad whatever,
ect) I want to bench test it. As far as the double
relay goes, all I can see is it controls the fuel
pump, either from ignition, or intake air sensor. If
one was to &quot;hot wire&quot; the pump, would the double relay
even be needed to start the engine, or could you hold
the air sensor slightly open to fake out the engine so
it thinks its running. Modifying the stand right now
so everything can be properly grounded.
 Hopefully someone has done this before, or knows of
another procedure.
 TIA for any ideas...
