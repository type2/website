Subject: Re: Heater Box Exhaust pipes?

&gt; I was just told that my ' 78 Westy originally came with &quot;heater box
exhaust
&gt; pipes&quot;. Mine seem to be missing. There is nothing on the heater boxes that
&gt; looks like an exhaust pipe, just a hole in the top of the control boxes to
&gt; vent out the hot air when the control flapper is off. Is someone pulling
my
&gt; leg, or are the boxes really susposed to have there own exhaust pipes. If
so,
&gt; why? And do I really need them? The guy who told me this said that they
help
&gt; to keep the engine from over-heating. Thanks for the help.

Parker,
Yes, '78 and '79 Buses were fitted with heat exchanger exhaust pipes (good
name).  They're really flapper box exhaust pipes.  They were simply pipes
that screwed to the frame outboard of the heat exchangers.  Flexible tubing
ran up to the heater flapper boxes, and hot air from the flapper boxes,
which in previous years had been vented right from the flapper boxes, now is
sent through these pipes and exits at the rear of the Bus.

I would doubt that you need them as you'll notice '78 and '79 are the only
years to have them.  With the start of production of the Vanagon, these
pipes were eliminated even though the same engine was used.  The Vanagon
goes back to dumping that hot air right out at the flapper box.

My '79 still has the pipes and I'm not going to remove them but I think
you'll be OK without them.
