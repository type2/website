Subject: RE: Needed: Cabinet handle in Westy 

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;the small handle on the drawer/cabinet above the ice box (and 
&gt; below the sink)
&gt; &gt;has cracked and broken. This is the one with the plunger 
&gt; mechanism. Anybody 
&gt; &gt;have an idea where I could find a new one?

Got 'em.  $9.95 each in black or gray.
