&gt; So, my question is, can I run a 12 foot wire from the sensor, up to the front 
&gt; of my bus, to my digital multimeter (set for OHMs of course) and then run 
&gt; another wire from the meter 12 feet back to the motor to the FI wiring 
&gt; harness.  Will the multimeter interrupt or alter the resistance?  Will the 24 
&gt; feet of wire have any appreciable effect on the resistance?  Is this even 
&gt; possible (ie. with one lead connected to the FI harness and the other to the 
&gt; sensor will I be able to get a resistance reading at all)?

No, you can't take a resistance reading of an active circuit in this
manner.

You will have to measure either the current through the sensor or the
voltage across the sensor ( or possibly both).
