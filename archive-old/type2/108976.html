Subject: Re: [T2] automatic crank endplay ?

IMHO, I would, for the purpose of measuring the endplay, push/pull on the
pulley end of the crank and measure at the flexplate end of the crank. If
you are using a dial indicator for measurement, the measuring force of the
indicator will not flex the plate appreciably.
    Not sure if this was exactly what you are after or not. Hope it helps-
Jeff

&gt; ok, got the torque converter plate put on the engine and i was wanting to
&gt; measure endplay but with the flex in the plate i don't feel i can get an
&gt; accurate reading. .........and then tried to flex back and forth on the
plate then
&gt; noticed the flex associated with such a thin piece of metal.
