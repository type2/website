&gt;There are connecting rods that attaches the motor arm to the wiper arms

are you refering to the switch on the steering column?


&gt;Ok switch. Either you have a faulty switch, na I think that if you reach up
&gt;under the dash and grab the back of the switch you will feel that it is
&gt;loose. You will need to unscrew the knob and get a pair of snap ring pliers
&gt;to tighten the flat washer looking nut with two grooves in it.
