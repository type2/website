Subject: cleaning tip of the day (2nd Stage)

Without downing the cleaning power of GoJo at all (love the stuff), let me
add the following.....

After a full day under the ol' bus, when you are greased up to the point
that your SO forbids re-entry into your mutual abode, try this...

Get the aformentioned SO to hand you either a bottle of WISK (preferred,
even tho it stings a bit) or the bottle of dishwashing detergent.  Put it
in a safe place (next to the hose).  Get out the can of WD-40 and spray
down all your greasy areay, except your face with the WD-40.  Rub it in
til you have loosened the grease.  Add detergent and mix the soap and
WD-40/grease until things look like they *might* come clean.  Add water
from the hose a little at a time.  If you don't get foam, add more
detergent then a little more water.  Rinse.  I have found that the
WD-40/grease slurry comes off much better than the grease alone.
