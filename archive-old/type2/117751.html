Subject: Re: [T2] Electric Fuel Pump, YES or NO?

Todd,

It will also keep just pumping away even with the engine stopped.

Scenario, fire starts because the fuel line popped out of the holder
to the carb....small fire, but engine dies cause spark plug wires melt
and short out...with the mech pump, the quanitiy of gas slows way 
down....with electric pump, no slowdown.

Don't ask me how I know...but I blew out the fire, fixed the the fuel line 
and the spark plug wires and drove it away....*much* the wiser.

Key on = fuel pressure whether you like it or not.


I've used both, and generally prefer mechanical....electric on my 72 bus 
was noisy, but saved me from having to pull the engine or something in 
order to but a new fuel pump in...it was a long time ago in a land far 
away.&lt;grin&gt;....maybe I put it in cause I could fix it with electric on the 
side of the road with minimal tools.

I don't think I have ever had a mechanical fuel pump just totally die on 
me all at once...it just starts getting funky and you know something is 
wrong.


I can't tell you how many times I've push started a bug by myself with a 
pretty much dead battery....it might have run a fuel pump...and then again 
might not.

FI is a whole nother matter.
As always...someone else probably has a whole list of problems with 
mechanical...

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hey guys,
&gt; 
&gt;      Quick question. Whenever anyone asks me about suggestions they can
&gt; do to make their car run better, etc, I always suggest switching to an
&gt; electric fuel pump instead of the mechanical fuel pump. (For carbureted
&gt; cars). Now, I just want to make sure, because I'm using them in ALL my
&gt; carbureted cars right now... is there any reason why a mechanical fuel
&gt; pump (other than push starting) would be better than an electric fuel
&gt; pump? 
&gt; Seems to me, an electric fuel pump is totally the way to go, better
&gt; starts, no loss of fuel pressure or vapor lock or any of that other
&gt; stuff.
&gt; 
&gt; Just curious..
&gt;
