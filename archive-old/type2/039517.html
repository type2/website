Subject: bad clutch operating fork!!-need german one.

Hi, I had a very bad sound come from my engine/clutch today when I tried
starting it, so out came the engine.  What I found was my brand new release
bearing broke into pieces, along with the *new* mexican made clutch
operating fork.  Last summer when we put the new fork in, it was different
in a few ways from the original.  I bought it through bus depot/rmmw.  I'm
not blaming them at all, just warning others that the mexican made one will
destroy your parts!  Does anyone know where I can get a new german made
fork, or a good used one?  I looked at bus depot &amp; all they have (on the
website) is the one I already bought.  Any leads to where I can get one
would be greatly appreciated.  My bus has a '69 transmission  with a '71dp
engine.

thanks in advance,
Keri
