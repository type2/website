Possibly silly question Nick, but you didn't mention what else you were
doing in the meantime.

You didn't jack up any corner to look under the van, did you? The reason I
ask is that we ( OK I, but once only) tried to level the van while camping
( for the gas fridge ) by jacking one corner up a little. There was a major
panic when we couldn't get the sliding door latches to work until I let off
the jack.

Other than that, if you don't have a cupboard or fridge in front of the
door, you should be able to get the interior panel off and release the lock
with a screwdriver or pliers.

Good luck,

Neale

&gt; I was checking to make sure my all my door locks
&gt; worked on my 71 bus.  I went to lock my sliding door
&gt; and it locked fine.  When I went to unlock it, uh oh.
&gt; I can't get it unlocked? Does any one know how I can
&gt; get it unlocked and what is wrong with it?
