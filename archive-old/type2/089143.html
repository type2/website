Subject: Re: Fuel injector Question

Mike,

Both injectors you mention have a flow rate 18.1 lb/hr at 37 psi. So - the
odd one may work just fine.
This web site has a list of injector specs:
http://www.autospeed_dot_com/A_0102/P_2/article.html

Usually a vacuum leak will cause you to run lean, not rich. Doesn't the '81
have an oxy sensor involved in the FI system? If so a malfunctioning oxy
sensor may result in a rich mixture. Of course check all FI components as
best you can per Bentley. Also don't forget the vacuum line to you fuel
pressure regulator - it lowers fuel pressure at higher vacuum so *this*
vacuum leak *could* cause a rich condition.

Good Luck

Ed
'77 Westy

&gt;Hello all,
&gt;Today I pulled the 4 fuel injectors in my 81 Westy
&gt; found the 3 of them are Bosch 0 280 150 114 &amp; 1 is 0
&gt;280 150 116 according to my research the 0 280 150 114
&gt;is the correct one for my 81 Westy and the 0 280 150
&gt;116 is for 77-79 Superbeetle's.
&gt;Do I need to go out &amp; get the Bosch 0 280 150 114 or
&gt;will the 0 280 150 116 injector work correctly.
&gt;I'm in the process of replacing all the fuel &amp; vaccum
&gt;lines.
&gt;The engine is running real rich &amp; I thought it might
&gt;be a vaccum leak.
&gt;
&gt;Mike
