Subject: [T2] RE: VW Camper &amp; Bus Magazine is Here!

&quot;VW Camper &amp; Commercial&quot; actually pre-dates Just Kamper's mag.  I've
subscribed to VWC&amp;C since Issue One and highly recommend it.  VWC&amp;B sold me
a copy, direct from JK, with a big, ugly coffee stain on a page about
upgrading to Porsche brakes...  They never responded to my email complaints!

YMMV--
Joe

&gt; Just a note that I now have more issues of the U.K. published
&gt; &quot;VW Camper &amp; Bus&quot; magazine in stock.  To my knowledge it is
&gt; the only English language magazine exclusively devoted to VW
&gt; busses, vans and campers. It's a fascinating read, and a
&gt; &quot;must-read&quot; for Bus enthusiasts. There are tons of tech
&gt; articles, pictorials, buying guides, info on camper
&gt; conversions never found in the U.S., and more. Each issue is
&gt; about 100 pages.


Here's a better link (shows all 3 at once)...
