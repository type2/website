Subject: RE: [T2] 80 MPH Type 2

I think Rocky Mountain Motorworks and CIP1 are but a few of the vendors who 
sell disk brake upgrades(wide5) for '68-'70 bays.

Eron


There are disk kits for splittys, but no
&gt;upgrade kits that I could find for Bays. If anyone can help me in area,
&gt;I'd appreciate it.
