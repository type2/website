Subject: Re: [T2] 1600 DP engine (new) with bad #2 cylinder

Chris,

There is a good possibility that the fuel injection tube(or what is left 
of it) is embedded in the head or top of the piston.

The &quot;sharper&quot; edges of it or the sharp edges of the places where it hit 
inside the head or piston may be causing some problems.

Bottom line.....pull the engine and the head and take a look.
Or...ignore the misfire and drive it...


Cheers, dave

&gt; Ever since the accelerator pump injection tube got sucked into the 
&gt; engine, #2 cylinder misfires.  I had first discovered the problem when 
&gt; I pulled the #2 spark plug and saw the the electrode was bent so that 
&gt; there was hardly any gap.  I looked down into the carburetor and saw 
&gt; that the aforementioned tube was missing, so I deduced that is what 
&gt; caused the spark plug electrode to get bent.  I straightened it out, 
&gt; but it never ran right.  I pulled the spark plug again (actually all of 
&gt; them - to do a compression test, which was dead even at 115 pounds)) 
&gt; and the #2 spark plug was black - all the rest were OK.  I put in new 
&gt; spark plugs and #2 turned black again.  Pulling spark plug wires with 
&gt; the engine idling causes RPM to drop on all cylinders, but less on #2.  

&gt; register about 1000 ohms.  Valve lash is fine.  What am I missing?  Do 
&gt; I have to pull the engine?  It's a new meximotor which I had installed 
&gt; about 5,000 miles ago.
