Subject: camper questions

Hi all

i have decided to purchase a camper. my plans are to find a vehicle that
will reliably allow me to travel to and from several weekend bluegrass
festivals each summer, no further than 600 miles away. i prefer a hookup for
a sink and power, and air conditioning would be nice, but i know hwat my
chances are with that! two people, a couple instruments, and light baggage
will be the maximum load.

i have three questions:

1.) how much should i expect to pay for a RELIABLE vehicle--will $3000 do
it?
2.) what should i look for in terms of reliability (models, years, features,
etc to avoid?), and
3.) where is the best place to look for such a vehicle--CA is not out of the
question.

thanks for ANY help you can offer. i am ignorant in the ways of the VW
camper!

thanks

kip
