Subject: 1800 heads


I'm looking at a few options for heads now, and I want to ask
the list about one of them --  Mofoco.

They sell both new and remanufactured Type IV heads for reasonable
prices. Does anyone have any experience with them?

I'd appreciate any feedback, positive, negative, or neutral.

Thanks.

--Stephen
