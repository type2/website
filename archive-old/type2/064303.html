Extended forecast for this weekend is beautiful... Crisp in the evenings,
nippy in the mornings, highs for the day low 80's....

For those of you who confirmed reservations, your names are registered at
the front gate with the park ranger (although the mere sight of a bus/bug
will probably send you our way) who will tell you your site number. I tried
to get as many sights as I could nearby each other, but you never know, we
might wind up with a couple of tourists in a, gasp!, Winnebago parked in the
midst of all us westies....

Last report from the park rangers:

expected Park capacity  45%  (we're now officially off-season...yeah!)
expected river height   +2' (very canoe-able)
expected rainfall       0.00&quot;

Last chancers contact me soon and we'll add you to our pencil'd in list
which we'll fax up to the park rangers thursday afternoon.  While not a
gaurantee you'll get a campsite near our festivities at least you'll know
your name will be written down in some park rangers log in Florida....


p.s. for info/maps faxed to you drop me a line with your fax number or call me
at the shop (BusBones Vintage VW Restorations) at 1.352.368.2376
