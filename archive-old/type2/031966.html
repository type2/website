It's more important that your timing &quot;is correct&quot; in the sense that the 
right sparkplug is sparking when its particular cylinder is near TDC on 
the compression stroke than whether it's firing at 5 deg before or after 
TDC.  You should be able to get you timing &quot;close enough&quot; using the notch 
on your diststributor and your timing scale.  Do you have your plug wires 
attached correctly?

&gt; I'm sure its typical, but I have my new engine installed after several

&gt; been able to check its timing, since I need to devise a starter switch or
&gt; else fine a friend toi turn the key.  So I guess I have compression, I
&gt; seem to have some gas, and some spark, other than timing the spark, and
&gt; verifying the flow of gas from the injectors, what other steps would
&gt; people recommend.
