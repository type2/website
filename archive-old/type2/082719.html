Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Why can't people fix things right

It seems as if most vehicles go through a period of neglect
during their lifetime.  Their value drops to nil and whoever is driving it
does whatever is needed just to keep it running without putting a lot of
dollars into it.  Field expedient repairs are the rule and visits to the
dealer parts department are few.

There are a few lovingly maintained vehicles out there whose owners keep
them in tip-top shape, but it is unlikely that we will see any of these
vehicles for sale because the owners want to keep them.  It's only when
these owners themselves expire that we sometimes get a chance to buy the
all-original, dealer maintained, '71 westy in a barn.

The rest of us just have to fix kludges and dream...
