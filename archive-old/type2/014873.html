&gt; The
&gt;  idea is to get an air gap on either side between the
&gt;  heat source and the engine tin.

Actually the way it works if the heat shield absorbs all the radiation and 
reradiates it equally in both directions, half continues on and half is 
radiated back where it came from.  A really efficient way to build a heat 
shield would be to have two or even three layers of sheet metal with small 
spacers between them.
