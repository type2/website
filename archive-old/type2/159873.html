The sound files are at the above URL.

The two files called 'motorsounds' are showing the terrible clatter when 
warm. the two files from the 25th show what it CAN sound like when I 
have re-tuned everything I can find.

&gt; I am interested in hearing this sound clip also.  I have an avp long block
&gt; in my bus (about 9 years old, probably under 20k on the engine), and it has
&gt; had a clatter at idle.  They attributed it to a hydro lifter, but I don't
&gt; think it is that.  I have not tore it down to investigate further, though,
&gt; either.  Other than any and all recommended lifter priming procedures,
&gt; which eliminate that lifter clatter at start up, but have done nothing to
&gt; the at idle clatter I get after the engine is warmed up.  I suspected a
&gt; loose valve seat, but the spark plugs indicate no foul play there... I will
&gt; keep watching this thread with anticipation.
