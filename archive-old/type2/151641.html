Subject: Re: [T2] Westy tent?

Don,

I bought one of the tent's that Ron sells for my 78 std.  Terrific!

It's a driveaway tent.  Leave it up, drive off and back and no big deal.
Once my wife and I set it up a couple of times, it was easy.

The hardest part was figuring how to roll it back up to fit in the bag!

Cheers, dave

 Ya know, I was all excited when I got my Westy tent. But it wasn't
 until last night when I sat down and contemplated building it. And
 then I actually set it up today.
&gt; 
&gt; What a pain!
&gt; 
&gt; So I'm selling it.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anybody here really like their tents? Responses on The Samba
&gt; appear to be about 50/50.
