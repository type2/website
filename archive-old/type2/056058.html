3 Questions:
&gt;&gt;
1) Where does Volkswagen intend us to store the larger table in a '78
Camper?  It doesn't fit behind the driver seat (though there's a bungee
strap for something) nor does it fit under the stove in the extended
cabinet.

2) Also, where does the kidee-cot usualy store?

3) Finally, is there a Westfalia-specific wiring diagram/owner's manual
in existence?  Bentley and Muir don't say too much about it.

1.  I have a 79 Westy but I think the setup is the same.  My table lays
flat on top of the padding over the engine compartment.  There is a short
plastic strap with a vertical strap connected to the vertical cabinet on
the driver's side.  The table snaps onto the end of this strap to keep it
from sliding around as you race around curves building up tremendous
G-forces.

2.  I'm not sure of the 'official location' of the kiddie cot.  I store in
the cabinet under the back seat.

3.  If you get a satisfactory answer to this question, could you please
forward it to me?
