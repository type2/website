&gt; I think that I'll have to rebuild the motor, replacing at a minimum the

Hi David -

Unless you're really excited about rebuilding that engine yourself,
seriously consider a
new&lt;http://aircooled_dot_net/new-bin/viewproductdetail.php?keyword2=ESE0001&amp;carti
d=&gt;engine
if it can fit in your budget.  When you consider that your core
engine has value, the difference between the cost of the new engine and the
cost of a quality rebuild is negligible.

I've been driving my Meximotor since 2002, and it's been fabulous.  Now that
Old Beetles and Old Buses are no longer in production in Mexico and Brazil,
it's fair to assume that the new engines won't be available forever.
