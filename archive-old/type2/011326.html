Subject: Wanted: 73-74 exaust afterburning system components
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

Fellow listees,

I am trying to re-create my original 1974 bus engine
after former owners have systematically stripped parts
off of it over the years.

I would like to find out if any of you have a whole,
or pieces of a '74 (or '73) bus exhaust afterburning
system that you would be willing to get rid of?
Failing this, information on possible sources for
these missing pieces.

The main parts of this system ('74 and '73) consist of
an air pump with air filter, brackets to hold the pump
to the fan housing, an anti-backfire valve, cross
pipes and connectors to the head's smog ports (Here, I
know, the pipes of a '73 and '74 differ. The '73 has
four head ports. The '74 head and x-pipes have three
ports.), and a belt drive pulley off of the fan hub.

Thanks,
Brian
