Subject: fuel line replacement a go!


--Eron,

I already bought the Berrymans for the first go-round, but I will check out your suggestions.

Didn't know there was an injector removal tool, but now I do.

Thanks,

Billy

&gt;As for the FI cleaner, look in the archives for a thread on Redline additives.  I HIGHLY reccomend the SI-1.  If it isn't available to you, use the Chevr*n Techron, available at most FLAPS.

&gt;Change the seals.  Leaks can cause amazingly difficult to find symptoms.  Besides, they're easy to 
replace.  Just order the tool to remove the injector when you order the fuel line(try Bus Depot).
