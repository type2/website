To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

My friend has a  72 Westy for sale.......
its the early bumper style Westy with the low front turn signals, 
disc brakes etc......
Orange color with white pop-top
nice sold California camper

its kinda like Burger King........you can have it your way......

the motor is dead right now,  so he was either going to put another Type 4 
motor in it or an upright 1600  motor, or buy it with a dead motor......

$4000 running with either type motor

if  you are interested please email me for photos etc......thanks
