Subject: VW-NEED BRAKE BOOSTER INFO ASAP!
Message-Id: &lt;199812042215.OAA14547_at_swift.rand_dot_org&gt;

As Rickey used to say to Lucy, &quot;Please 'splain someting to me...&quot; I'm
almost positive that there is a problem with my brake booster but I want
to be sure before I drop the bucks to get a rebuilt one.  In order to
properly diagnose the situation, I think I need to understand how the
booster works on my '71 Type II.

The problem I'm having is that at I can feel the Bus not running right at
speeds, especially under load.  Going up hills is especially bad and I've
had to shift into 3rd when 4th worked just a short time ago.  All of the
logical starting points have been checked out and replaced or adjusted
(i.e., timing, valves, ignition circuit, yadda yadda yadda).  Compression
is good and even.  The beast idles perfectly.

After I've been driving it for a while, I find that there is something
&quot;holding me back&quot;.  It's hard to explain but it's like a smooth drop off
in power.  Where this is most notable is on hills but I can feel it on the
flats as well.  Since everything else was checked out, I suspected a
vaccum leak.  The problem is that the manifold and carb fittings in the
engine compartment are tight.  That can mean a vacc leak in the brake
booster system.  Indeed, removing the one-way check valve and plugging the
line to the manifold results in the Bus operating just fine with full
strength.  Aha! you say, it's a booster line problem so go out and buy
some of that expensive vacc line stuff.

The problem is that I did that about two years ago and they seem just
fine.  I've sprayed starting fluid on the entire length (except for the
pipe that is concealed) and tightened up the clamps.  No difference.
Another bit of evidence is that when the engine is turned off and the
check valve is removed, there is a significant &quot;whooosh&quot; of air running
into the line just when the connection between the valve and the booster
line is broken.  Thus, the line from the valve to the booster is OK since
pre-existing vaccum remains in the line even with the engine off.  I have
not yet disconnected the booster line at the servo and plugged it there
and tested engine performance (the final test of line integrity) but let's
assume that it's OK for now.

So it seems that the booster might be playing tricks.  I checked the Type
II archive and it appears that folks who had booster problems fall into
two categories:  Those who have reduced braking assist due to an internal
leakage in the booster and those who watch their brake pedals drop to the
floor when the engine is revved.  I don't think I'm in the first category
since my brakes work just fine.  I don't think I'm in the second (though
see below) since my pedal stays in the proper position even if the engine
is gunned.

I've racked my brain to figure out what is wrong and did some tests that
yielded some interesting results.  As I said, removing the check valve and
plugging up the line to the manifold makes the engine runs fine.  The way
I've been doing this on the fly is to unplug the check valve from both
lines, reverse it, and stick it into the manifold line only.  The one-way
feature seals the manifold just fine though with the booster line open, I
have to do the usual brake stomp to stop.   The Bus then eats hills like it
used to.

Today, however, I simply disconnected the valve from the manifold line and
plugged it with a nice fat bolt I found.  The valve remained connected to
the booster line.  This time, I did *not* get 100% performance.  The loss
of power going up hills was almost as bad as usual.  I pulled over, turned
off the engine, pulled the check valve from the booster line (leaving the
bolt in the manifold line), heard the usual whoosh of residual vaccum, and
took off.  Back to 100% performance.  Hmmmm.

I reconnected everything back up to stock.  Drove down the highway for a
while after feeling the usual hesitation and then downshifted to slow down
markedly.  Put the Bus into neutral and let it roll to a stop.  Problem is
that I was on a *very* slight incline but still should have continued to
move, albeit slowly.  Without touching the brakes, I put the Bus into
first and shut off the engine.  With the vehicle stopped, I went into the
back, disconnected the check valve from the booster line and heard the
whoosh, and then got behind the wheel and put it into neutral.  Sure
enough, the Bus began to smoothly move forward.  At no time was the brake
pedal in anything but the full upright (untouched) position.

OK, so perhaps what I have is not an air leak problem at all (at least not
one that affects engine performance directly) but a brake problem.
Perhaps at high RPMs the brakes are being applied automatically enough to
retard engine speed but not enough to make the linings smoke.  The
application, if it is happening, is occuring in a way that does not affect
the brake pedal inside the passenger department.

My problem is that I don't understand how a brake booster actually works.
The Benchley's manual only talks about how to replace them, not how to fix
the innards.  I thought about how I would design such a thing and came up
with a model that is probably inaccurate.  My vision (please correct me)
of a booster is that it is a diaphram whose center is attached to the rod
from the pedal to the master cylinder.  The diaphram itself sits in a
partially sealed ball.  The front hemisphere is permanently open to the
atmosphere (via a tube that goes into the body for safekeeping).  The
rear hemisphere is connected to the engine vaccum line by a valve and to the
open atmosphere by a second valve).  Normally, the valve to the engine is
closed and the valve to the air is open.  Apply the brakes and the air
valve then closes while the vaccum valve opens to a degree proportional to
amount of pressure being applied to the pedal.  This sucks the diaphram
rearward and assists in pumping the master cylinder.  When you release the
brakes fully, the vaccum valve closes and the air valve opens allowing the
diaphram to return to the neutral position via the pull of the spring on
the brake pedal.  Like I say, I made this up so it is most likely way off
base.  Let's assume, for the moment, that I'm not crazy.

Could it be that these valves are not working as designed?  If the air
valve isn't opening when the brakes are supposedly off, wouldn't that put
pressure on the master cylinder due to residual vaccum in the rear chamber?
Just closing the vacc line wouldn't be enough unless there was a way to
allow air to rush into the rear hemisphere.  But if this were true,
shouldn't the pedal fail to return to the full upright position?  I've
always assumed that there was a solid connection between the pedal and the
master cylinder and that the booster only assisted in driving the piston
into the master cylinder (rather than doing it by itself).  One thing that
may be very important to this diagnosis is that I was recently involved in
a rear-ender (her's, not mine) and there was some disruption and buckling
of the passenger compartment floor where the brake pedal is hinged.  The
problems noted seem to have started right after this collision (though I
can't be sure).  Local brake repair shop (Winston Tires in Santa Monica,
CA) says the booster checks out fine (as does the rest of the brake
system) but I don't think they really understand the nature of the beast
(in fact, they will not replace boosters and instead farm out the work to
VW shops).

I can get a rebuilt booster for about $190 here in L.A. and can even pay
$50 or so to get it installed if I don't want brake fluid all over me.  But
$240 is $240 and I don't want to shell it out if that isn't the problem.

PLEASE give me some advice, even if wrong.  I need to move on this soon.

Infinite Thanx,


Nick
