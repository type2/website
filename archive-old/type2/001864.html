Thanks to everyone for the many replies. I lost my internet service about 2
hours after I posted last Friday, so I was unable to reply. Then I had to go
out of town, but anyway, thanks for the ideas.
The engine in my '70 Westy I guess has a &quot;doghouse&quot; shroud on it since it's
off a '71, and has the bulge on the back side of it.
I've decided that my timing must be wrong, so I'm going to try 7.5 degrees
BTDC, and see if that helps.
Also I installing a sump today, so it will now have 5 quarts of oil
capacity.
Another suggestion was to switch from 20W-50 to straight 40 W oil. I'm going
to try that also as I'm installing my sump.
Again thanks for all the info, hopefully it will be running cooler so I can
go camping in it soon.
