Subject: Re: [T2] Ordering from Bus Depot??

Dave/List,

My order arrived a couple of days earlier than advertised, quantity 4!
 I will definitely order from them again.

Later,

&gt; You folks that have order parts from Bus Depot; How long does it usually
&gt; take to have an order completed?  I ordered 11 items on or around 17
&gt; Sept 01
&gt; and as of today I've only received 3 of the items.  I had to call to
&gt; get the
&gt; magazine sent ahead.  I was told then the order should be completed
&gt; in 2
&gt; weeks, well that was 3 weeks ago.  During that time the Jackpoint came
&gt; in.
&gt; Is this normal?  I'm starting to think the savings isn't worth the
&gt; wait.  A
&gt; month to a month and a half would have been understandable.
