Subject: 1800cc duel carb vs 2000cc fuel injection
Date: Tue, 3 Jul 2001 01:02:11 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I have a 2000cc fuel injected engine that is running pretty well, but I am
interested in buying another engine to rebuild and have as a spare for when
my good engine goes.  I have a chance to get a 1800 cc engine that still
runs for $50.  I have been told that an 1800 cc engine with duel carbs can
be stronger than my current 2000cc.  Is this true and if so how?   Will I
loose gas mileage?  Engine life?  Etc.

Should I hold out for a 2000cc with hydraulic lifters instead?

Thanks,
Bob
