Subject: Re: 72-74 dual carb web page??

Zac was looking for help and/or pictures showing how the stock connections
go together on the early Type IV motors...

Welp, I have a '72, a stock '73 motor, and a stock '74 motor... but the
'73 motor is in many many pieces at the moment. I'll shoot some pictures
as it goes back together, but that may be a while. Taking useful pictures
of the '74 motor would be tough, 'cuz it's in my Bus. But for the time
being, I'd be happy to look at the thing and talk you through the bits and
pieces via p-mail or phone, if you would like.
