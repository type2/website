Subject: What's the correct torque here??  33 ft./lbs.!!!!
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.OSF.3.91.990617083301.25103B-100000_at_Sherlock.SIMS.Berkeley.EDU&gt;

Thanks to all who replied to my qustion regarding the torque to use to 
mount the engine carrier to the crankcase on a 2.0l Vanagon engine.  I dug 
further into my stash of manuals and pulled out the &quot;Official Service 
Manual&quot; for 1968 to 1979 buses.  It has a real nice table of torques 
which includes the size and quality grade of the  fastener in question - 
if only other manuals were this good!

Anyway, this table indicates that 14 ft./lbs. is the correct torque to 
use here, FOR AN 8MM BOLT.  As was pointed out to me, I mis-identified 
the bolts for my application ('80-'83 Vanagon) as 8mm when they are 
actually 10mm in size.

So I believe the 33 ft./lbs. spec'd in 2 of the manuals I consulted is 
correct, and that's what I'm using.  Looks like the 14 ft./lbs. quoted in 
the other two manuals (Wilson, Clymer) is a carryover from the pre-'80 
Type4 engines.
