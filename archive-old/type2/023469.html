X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Dear Volks,

I'm flying to Glacier National Park for vacation tonight.  I saw this one on 
E'y.  I discussed this Westy with this gentleman for about a week with the 
idea that I might drive it around Glacier and then back home through 
Yellowstone and the Grand Tetons.  He and I could not come together on price, 
so he plans to re-list it that certain auction site.  I suggested he let the 
folks on the list know about it first.  He was at the first meeting ever of 
LIMBO and really wants the bus to go to someone who will appreciate it.  All 
I know about the bus is what's in his ad.  He wants $4,500.  That may be a 
fair Seattle or NorCal price, but it's too high for Texas.  If I brought it 
back here, it would sell for $3,500 to $3,800, so we couldn't agree on price. 
 For someone that wants the free lodging and touring, it's still a good deal. 
 I've edited his description which he forwarded to me only to remove the 
details of his recent auction and the reference to the auction site.

AVAILABLE: 1978 Westphalia camper in very good to excellent condition.  Owner 
is retiring to Montana -- and from mobile camping -- and is reluctantly 
selling great restoration vehicle.  If buyer is willing to pick up vehicle, 
seller will include a &quot;Montana vacation package,&quot; -- i.e., a home base here 
from which to tour the State.  If not, delivery is negotiable, depending on 
eventual selling price.  Camper is in good to excellent condition throughout, 
except where noted below.  (Was on an auction site)  Prospective buyers came 
close but did not meet Reserve Price; vehicle will be relisted shortly.  
Original Porsche engine has 63,900 miles.  Owner uses only Mobil 1 synthetic 
oil, does not run engine above 3,000 rpm and hence can promise an engine in 
excellent condition.  Vehicle runs and cruises beautifully.  All equipment 
original except new Bosch fuel pump.  Vehicle comes with table, child's 
hammock, water tank and working pump, ice box, interior spare tire slot with 
spare,
two new unmounted tires, rear light truck tires, rear door mosquito screen, 
etc.  Owner added highly effective stereo sound system, equalizer, 
intermittent wiper, bar tachometer, in-line heater booster, compass, nose 
cover, etc.  Very solid body. Minor rust on lower edges of front doors and on 
steel wheels from sitting outside on humid East Coast.  Rust, barely visible, 
under right-rear reflector from minor collision (delivery vehicle operator 
opened his rear door just as I was backing down an alley!).  Vehicle does 
have its flaws, the bulk of which are cosmetic.  Needs new upholstery for 
front seats, new headliner, new carpeting, new outside rear-view mirrors, 
touchups.  Serious restorer would probably wish to replace windshield and 
gasket. Owner knows of nearly identical vehicle that sold last year on East 
Coast for $6,500 and has seen others advertised for as much as $8,500.  This 
one is being advertised for $4,500 and, hopefully, a quick sale.  If 
interested, please contact Teddy Roe at &lt;troe_at_imt_dot_net&gt; or call at 
406-256-7201.  Serious inquiries, please.
