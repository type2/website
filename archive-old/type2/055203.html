Marko,

First, Don't Panic!

Second, don't tell AVP exactly what has happened yet.

They are very good and honest people; I know because I have met him
(Leonard) personally.

Ask them this:

'Did you weld and remachine the woodruff keyslot on the crank that you put
in my engine?'

Make them answer this question before you tell them what has happened.

This procedure is an acceptable repair to a crank if it is done correctly.
There is a possibility that this procedure was performed on your crank, with
unacceptable results. When I returned my Longblock to them I was charged a
core on my crank because this slot was wallowed out and they said that the
crank was unuseable.

It is also possible that you did not sufficiently torque the bolt when you
installed it; if this is so it is a mistake to learn an expensive lesson
from.

I installed this bolt on my crank without a torque wrench but I used Loctite
Blue to secure it in place.

Good Luck,

Marko Writes:

the woodruff key that holds it on is long gone. if you look at the
crankshaft, instead of a spot that should look like this   |_|  there's a
spot that looks like this  \_|

I don't have another woodruff key, so i dunno if it'll stay if i put it all
back (i doubt it).  will AVP's warranty cover this?? or will they give me
some runaround about improper installation. the engine has less than 200
miles on it. can i have a machinist try to fix it?? will i have to tear the
whole engine down??  please tell me i'm not up sh*t's creep without even a
turd for a paddle. It'll be bad enough even if they DO replace my longblock.
