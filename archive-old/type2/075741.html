Subject: Re: [T2] spare tire and bus jack


&gt;ALSO... Spare tire cover...I have the nose mounted
&gt;arrangement but the cover is wasted. I want to replace
&gt;the cover. I figured I would cut a round piece of
&gt;plywood and glue it to the inside of a new black vinyl
&gt;cover and then mount the VW emblem back on. I believe
&gt;that I did this way back in the early '80s on another
&gt;bus I owned. Anyone have a source for the black vinyl
&gt;tire cover?? It would be cool to find one with a VW
&gt;emblem printed on already!

I believe it's Bus Depot that carries the black covers and the 
white-with-black-piping covers. They fit very nicely, and it would be quite 
easy to spraypaint a vw logo on (with a carefully crafted stensil) or even 
take a real metal emblem and bolt it on. They're pretty cheap, as I recall, 
and look great.
