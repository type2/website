Subject: Re: [T2] paint/painter question

Terry,

It looks 3 feet deep cause the surface is snooth, smoother, smoothest!

Ok, propaganda maybe....but!  

This polish is *not* what you see on the store shelf, but &quot;show car 
polish&quot; and it looks....well...10 feet deep after putting just one coat 
on.  I try and look at the actual paint, and can't get my eyes to focus on 
it...all I can see is whatever is being reflected.  It is also the easiest
stuff to put on and polish off that I have *ever* encountered(40 yrs of 
polishing cars).  :-))

The deal is, they sell(for the exact same price) a bottle for clearcoat 
and a bottle for &quot;regular&quot; paint.

So, my question remains, how can I walk up to one of my  cars and 
say...oh, this is &quot;clearcoat&quot;...or oh, that is  &quot;regular&quot; paint for the 
ones that I didn't have painted myself.


Cheers, dave

&gt; Dave,
&gt; The polish / wax propaganda &quot; made for Clear coat finish&quot; is just
&gt; that--propaganda.

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; Clear also gives the paint finish--&quot;Depth&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; So the paint looks 3 ft. deep when wet sanded and rubbed out.
&gt; 
&gt; Why ?
