Subject: hot start problem/ air cooled vanagon

Has anyone out there ever experienced a hot start problem on their air 
cooled vanagon ? It hasn't happened lately, but it seems like every summer 
when I'm on super long road trips This problem comes back, I talked to bus 
depot and they said there was no relay available for vanagons, only for bays 
and splities. Also on these long road trips I am also running my 
refrigerator and I was wondering if the fridge was draining my battery even 
though the van was running, I wonder if a second battery would help my 
problem.   Any comments or thoughts on this would be apreciated.
