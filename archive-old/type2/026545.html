&gt;Hi, has anyone used an electric fuel pump on their bus?  I have one
&gt;on my bus right now (rebuilding 1776cc engine), and was just 
&gt;wondering if I should keep it on there or go back to a stock one?

If it works, why change it?  I've been running an electric fuel pump in my
73 for more than 8 years.  Ran one in my 74 914 for 4 years before switching
back to FI (which of course also uses and electric pump) and have one in my
58 single cab too.  

The only thing you might want to consider is forking out the $35 and buy a
spare to carry with you.  They don't fail often, but when they do there is
no warning and no remedy except to get a new one.
