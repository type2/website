Subject: re help adjusting the hidraulic valves-Boston Bob's tome

It's not that simple.  Read Boston Bob's final tome on hydraulic
adjustment- which I paste here with some formatting breaks. (Use widest
window)- my only question is how can the effect of air in the lifter not
allow valve to close- I'd think air is much more compressible than oil
and thus valve would if anything be too closed???????
                             Boston Bob's history of Hydraulic Lifters
                    the final chapter (Almost like the book said)
                                          By Bob Donalds 
                There are performance problems that have been traced to
the hydraulic lifters that are in
            some air-cooled and all water boxer VW engines. Among the
symptoms are noisy lifters on
            cold start. However keep in mind that if the van has been
parked for a few days one or more
            lifters can bleed down and this can be the reason for the
noise and does not necessarily mean
            that there are lifter problems. The symptoms of the lifter
problems I am talking about in this
            article are low idle when cold, hard or not starting hot,
poor performance when the engine
            warms up and the power (vacuum) assist brakes may not work
as well at times because of the
            low intake manifold vacuum. These symptoms can be caused by
improper hydraulic valve
            setup. This article is about how to properly setup the
vanagon engine with hydraulic lifters.
            There have been a lot of differing opinions and methods
regarding proper setup of hydraulic
            lifters.

                This issue of proper setup has haunted me for years and
cost me lots of time, money and
            peace of mind. In fact one of my own vans would not start
hot unless it was push started or it
            was left to cool off for a couple of hours. This went on for
2 years with no trace of a                       reason until I
understood that it was the lifters.

                It's no understatement when I say I have lots of trouble
and limited success with preloading 
            of the hydraulic lifters in the VW busses and Vanagons. In
fact I have had lifters that would not
            take any preloading at all. It has been suggested that
because the lifters are installed on their 
            side that they trap air above the check ball that's in the
center of the lower piston that's             inside the hydraulic
lifter and I agree. Air bound hydraulic lifters that are preloaded or
            that are set to O lash (no clearance or preload) do not
allow the valves to close completely after
            the engine warms up. I believe this is due to the air in the
lifter expanding as the engine warms             up. I now understand
that installing new or used lifters pre-loaded (no valve clearance) may
NEVER             allow the hydraulic lifters to displace the air
remaining in the lifter because the plunger's                 travel in
the lifter body is minimized.

            A long time ago I gave up trying to fill the lifters per
Bentley and never looked at those pages
            again until I spoke with Stan at Bentley publishing who
pointed out that there are two versions
            of the lifter bleeding process in the book (on page #15.7
and 15.24). I personally found both
            descriptions confusing. The first method instructs you to
fill the lifter with oil and then                   install the lower
piston using a scribe to bleed off the oil under the piston as you press
the                piston into place. As for installing the lifter
socket into the lifter they don't tell you that               after you
get the lower piston in place it travels back up when you let it go of
it, leaving no               room to install the lifter socket and clip.
The second procedure would have you compress the                  lifter
in a press with an old push rod and purge the air as the lifter is
submerged in oil. They              don't say the procedure can take as
long as ten minutes per lifter and that a hydraulic press
is              needed. So I, as most people do, put only enough oil in
the lifter so I can compress it enough to             get the clip
installed.

            In the Past

                When trying to adjust the valves on a rebuilt engine, or
when working on an engine that has
            had the heads or rockers off for a few days or when
replacing lifters I have recommended the
            following. Set the valve lash to .006&quot; (i.e. no pre-load).
This does two things: first the valves 
            will surely close all the way when the engine warms up, and,
secondly, the piston in the lifter is
            now traveling it's full range of movement has a much better
chance of pumping out any remaining
            air. Run the engine for a couple of weeks before trying to
preload the valves. Bring the engine
            up to running temp then let it cool down to the point that
you will not burn yourself when you
            start to work on the engine. While the engine is still warm
restart it for no more than 30 seconds
            and check for any valve noise. If you hear noise, drive the
car for a few more days and check it
            again. Next, remove the valve covers, bring each piston to
TDC, and turn the adjuster screws in
            &lt; to = turn. If the valve opens when you turn the adjusting
screw in this means the lifter is                 fully pumped up with
oil and you can tighten the lock nut. In most cases the lifters will now
            self-adjust and allow the valve to fully close and stay
pumped up. If instead of the valve
            opening, the rocker arm moves the lifter as you turn the
adjuster, then re-set it to .006ths
            clearance, reinstall the valve cover, and recheck it in a
few days. The idea is to replace any
            unwanted air in the lifter with oil.

            
            So what's new?

                In the past week I had a customer call-When he dropped
it off I got the rest of the
            story. It seems that after a highway run of less than an
hour at 65 mph he pulled in his drive way
            and let the engine idle and the oil light came on. He also
reported that he thought the engine was
            down on power. At this point I felt that I might learn
something if I took the engine apart. So I
            offered to do so at no expense to the customer and he
agreed.

                The first thing I did was to put the engine on the
engine stand and install a flywheel and put
            my cut up bell housing and starter motor on so I could spin
the engine and test the oil pressure.
            The oil pressure was at the low end of the normal range
45pds with 10/30. The next test was
            the compression test and it was 125 on all cylinders a -
little low but still ok. Next step was to
            look at the rockers and check to see if the customer had
preloaded the valves. Some valves had
            lost clearance while others still had approximately .006ths.
I was very surprised to see that
            some lifters were still soft and air bound because the
customer had not reported any lifter noise.
            When the engine was disassembled I inspected and measured
everything. The inspection
            revealed that the only damage or problem was that the
customer had scuffed all four pistons on
            the load side (the load side of the piston is the side that
is pressed against the cylinder wall              as it's pushed down on
the power stroke).

            I was a little disappointed not to have found more of a
problem that would explain the oil light
            coming on (even though the customer had pushed the engine
too fast when it was new). The
            customer had agreed to buy new pistons and cylinders. I
thought that was the end of it with no
            great discoveries until my engine assembler, John Silva,
pulled the lifters apart for inspection.
            John over filled one of the lifters and could not get the
lower piston back down into place and
            instead of pulling the piston out and removing the oil he
tried moving the check ball to one side
            with a scribe and pushed the piston down with a small screw
driver. It dropped down enough to
            allow him to install the upper lifter socket and clip. The
next step is what's missing from the
            Bentley procedure. John took the same scribe that was used
to release the check ball and
            installed it in the oiling hole on the side of the lifter
body. This held the lower piston down so             that he could
install the upper socket and retaining clip. Once the clip was in place
he tested               the lifter by pushing the upper socket. The
lifter was hard as a rock indicating that there was no             air
in the lifter. No other methods that I have tried had these results.
This looked promising but             I remained skeptical. I asked John
to finish bleeding the rest of the lifters in the same way and
            adjust the rockers to the usual .006&quot; lash. We would test
the compression as usual after the
            engine was completely assembled. The first compression test
showed that we had 135 lbs on all
            cylinders. Next we preloaded the valves = turn and
immediately repeated the compression test:
            some of the valves had not closed so we waited ten minutes
and repeated the test. The
            compression was slightly lower: 125 lbs on all cylinders.
Because it was lower we then tested
            each intake and exhaust port with a vacuum tester to see if
the valves were closed and found
            that all the valves were sealed 100 percent. We next removed
the valve cover and checked
            each lifter by prying on the rocker and looking for
movement: all the lifters were still hard as a
            rock. The next morning we checked for soft lifters and found
that the # 2 exhaust valve lifter
            was soft. We spun the engine again for about one minute
using the starter motor and then
            checked the #2 lifter: it had regained most of its rigidity.

            My conclusions

                Lifters can be pre-bled and preloaded at &lt; to = turn at
the time the engine is being
            assembled provided that the above-mentioned procedure is
followed. However, assembled
            engines always have at least one or more lifters on the lobe
of the camshaft holding them open.
            Open valves have their springs compressed thereby increasing
pressure on their lifters. The
            increased pressure will cause the lifters to lose oil over
time. This can be days or weeks,
            depending on how clean the oil and the lifter's check valves
are. These engines may not have
            enough oil available to the expanding lifters when the
engine is first turned over during the                 start up
procedure. If the oil galley is empty, the lifter can take in air
instead of oil and                 becomes air-bound. An air-bound
lifter may expand as the engine heats up, and thereby prevent
a               valve from closing. To prevent this, some shops use a
pre-oiler. Oil is pressure-fed into the oil             galleys before
the engine is first started.

                So, caution must be used when preloading valves on any
new engines. Air-bound lifters are
            hard to detect. Exhaust valves that don't close completely
when the engine warms up will not
            transfer their heat to the valve seat, as it was designed
to. Instead, this excess heat travels               down the valve stem
and scorches the oil lubricating the valve stem and guides,
drastically                   reducing their life. I have seen this
specific damage time and time again on air-cooled engines as            
little as 10 K miles.

                I consider pre-loading valves to be optional. You may
never have had this lifter problem
            before, but I assure you the potential is high and
expensive. While the intake manifold vacuum is
            an easy way to know if the intake valves are completely
closed, the only way to be 100% sure
            all the valves are closed when the engine is warmed up is to
do a cylinder pressure differential
            test (sometimes known as a &quot;leak down&quot; test) that is
commonly done on race engines and
            aircraft. This test measures air pressure going into a
cylinder, and how much air remains.
            2%-4% is ideal.

            I hope this helps

G
&gt; Simple. Follow the normal valve adjusting procedure which requires you to use the rotor in the distributor to find TDC for #1. Turn the valve adustment screw until it contacts the valve stem, then 1.5-2 turns more. Bentley says 1 turn only, but wisdom and experience states the former. Rotate the engine 180 degree backwards, then do the valves for #2, then repeat for #3, then #4. Done.
