&gt;The bus I recently bought came with a &lt; 2000 mile engine in it, still 
&gt;under warranty with the local mechanic who rebuilt it. Whilst checking it 
&gt;out, I discovered that compression in #3 is only 90 lbs, the other 3 all 
&gt;&gt;= 120.

CYA, Jon.  Have you checked the valve clearance on #3 ?  (all around).
     Timing, too ?


&gt;So, I had the mechanic check it out, and his story is: &quot;If you used cheap 
&gt;gas (87 octane), then the piston could overheat, and this would not be 
&gt;covered by warranty. I'll pull the engine and fix it, but if it's not our 
&gt;fault, then you pay.&quot;

Supposed to run on REGULAR gas.  If not (hah), he should have ADVISED
you to run on higher octane.  But everybody ELSE runs on regular, what's
wrong with THIS engine ?? hmmmmm ?

&gt;I could do the work myself (I've built a 1600 DP before, with pretty good 
&gt;results), but thought I'd cash in on the warranty. What experiences have 
&gt;you all had along these lines? What can he reasonably say that will make 
&gt;this my problem?

The odds are that it's HIS problem.  Either the rings didn't seat
properly, or ?  However, he COULD say 90 pounds compression is within
limits of the rebuild.  I assume you have the paperwork from him ?
Check it carefully.  The (legal) problem you might run into, is that
the P.O. pitifully &quot;failed&quot; his responsibility to adequately care for
the engine under the contract. Even if for the first 2K miles.

The &quot;low octane&quot; excuse won't fly.  But you have the option of:

a) Threatening him with the Better Business Bureau in your area.
b) Going to small claims court.
c) Solving that one cylinder problem yourself. (in which case you
   may violate the agreement).


&gt;I guess the answer is really that I need to do the work myself, because 
&gt;he will probably come up with some excuse to charge me $400 for whatever 
&gt;it is he finds. Just looking for more opinions.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks!

Bottom Line = Is the lower compression in #3 a violation of the work
promise ?  Is it &quot;within&quot; the limits ?  Are YOU being a little picky about
it ? Is the P.O. responsible ?  Is the mechanic a jerk ?  Is the sky blue ?

Alternative - Drive the holy SHIT out of it, 'til it BLOWS...THEN take
it in and say &quot;Gosh, this is still under warranty...&quot;

I had a '68 Bug that needed a new engine in Canada. A new warranteed
motor was put in.  I (a few months later) drove it to L.A.  It blew about
100 miles from L.A.  I took it to the Biggest Dealer (authorized) in
L.A.  They said they &quot;fixed it&quot;.  Two miles down the freeway - tow truck
time again.  THIS time they used it as a *training* model for new techs,
and it ran BEAUTIFULLY.  I could only pray that other cars in the world
were treated so well !!!

The point is:  You can tell the guy, &quot;Hey, you can fix it NOW...or you can
fix it later...don't matter to me...&quot;

That'll probably work.

Good Luck,

John A.
