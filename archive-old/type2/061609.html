Subject: RE: Fuel Filler Hose - Help!

[...]
The Gates hose you mentioned sounds like the material they sell at marine 
supply houses for inboard engine exhaust hose.  As far as I know Gates is the 
only company making this hose in the 2.25&quot; size.

As it happens, this is the size and hose used on any Chris Craft inboard 
vessel using a small block Chevy engine &quot;marineized&quot; by Chris Craft.  It's not 
available on every street corner, but any marine repair shop or marine supply 
should have it available.  It's made as a wire-wound reinforced product, or as 
a &quot;normal&quot; construction smooth hose.  The composition is the same for both 
versions.

The wire reinforced hose is very stiff, especially when cold, but can be made 
to take a bend with a radius of around 8 or 9 inches without collapsing.

This hose withstands hot exhaust gases and cooling water discharge, even when 
the cooling water is salt water, very well and will last for many years in the 
marine environment.  It ought to work just fine for a fuel filler hose.

Another marine product worth investigating for this application is ready made 
stainless steel exhaust bends.   These come in various lengths, angles, and 
diameters.  They're not cheap, but neither is a NOS VW filler hose assuming 
you can find one.  It shouldn't be difficult to fabricate an assembly of 
straight Gates hose and a stainless steel bend to make a replacement late Bay 
filler tube.
