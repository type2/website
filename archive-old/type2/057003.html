&gt; Greetings One and All,
&gt; 
&gt; I think my decel valve has gone south.  I did the Bentley test and it
&gt; flunked with flying colors.  The main symptom is a very high idle
&gt; after warm-up.

A very high idle typically means an air leak somewhere.  First, I'd do a 
complete leak test.  I've found the easiest way to do this is to 
pressurize the system and then spray/swab soapy water everywhere looking 
for bubbles.  If I didn't find any significant leaks, and the decel valve 
fails the test, then the decel valve needs to be replaced.

&gt; 
&gt; My auxiliary air regulator doesn't seem up to snuff either.  The idle speed
&gt; right after starting is kind of slow, but not too.  I wonder if the high
&gt; ambient air temp helps keep the initial idle speed at a decent rpm?  BTW, I
&gt; can blow air through it when cold, but it's damn hard.

You should be able to blow air throught the aux air regulator fairly 
easily when it's cold (keeping in mind the small diameter of the hose) 
and not at all when it's warm.

&gt; From my moderately informed point of view, they both could use to be 
&gt; replaced.
&gt; Prob is, I really hate to lay out bucks when the most serious problem is a
&gt; high idle 
&gt; (sounds like about 1100 rpm).  
&gt; 

Depending on your location, a junkyard purchase might do the job just 
fine, and at moderate bucks.  I would probably do the decel valve first, 
since an aux air regulator that didn't open all the way when cold would 
be an irritant, but only for a short time while the engine is warming up.
