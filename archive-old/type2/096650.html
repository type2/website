starting from the left i know the first one.the headlights. then there is the
steering wheel and the next one i dont know then the windshield wipers.then
the emergency flashers next one i dont know&lt;&lt;

The one next to the steering wheel is the rear interior lights. The one with
the &quot;spring&quot; graphic on it is for the rear window defroster. As for the other
unknown one, it could be for a gas heater that may or may not still be
installed in your bus
