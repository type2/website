Subject: Re: [T2] EGR Filter (again)

The smog shops in California are supposed to see that all original smog
equipment is in place and, in the case of the EGR, they're supposed to see
that it's working.  The tech *should* unclip the rod that runs from the
throttle body to the EGR valve and work the valve arm by hand to see that
it's doing what it's supposed to do.  In my experience, some do this and
some don't.

Since the valve and the filter are, as far as I know, NLA, you might have to
go to a smog referee and plead your case.  Let us know how this turns out
since I'm facing the same problem - more or less - with my recently acquired
Westy.

&gt; If I block off the system, does anyone know if the CA smog folks would
&gt; notice?  (I've only smogged it once in CA, and I think I just got really
&gt; lucky)
