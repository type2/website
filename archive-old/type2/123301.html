Subject: Re: [T2] Engine tin screws

Richard,

Cheese head available at the local Ace hardware in various lengths, as 
well as (probably) in the metric screws kit from BD.

I got mine in Stainless from Ace....yes horribly inefficient and 
expensive, but *I* didn't think ahead.

some shown here

Cheers, dave

&gt; I took off the engine tin to do some painting and I stripped one of the screws. I should have had a small impact driver present but I manged to get all of the tough ones off that make a loud crack when I broke torque.
&gt; 
&gt; The originals are the ubiquitous metric phillips cheese head style (the worst design). I see several people sell kits of shiny slotted engine tin screws. I assume the bug and bus screws are the same except for a couple of places where length is a concern. The part numbers seem to be the same.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd prefer another style of screw that either of those two. Any recomendations?
