Subject: windshields

Howdy all,

I'm trying to replace the windshield in my '71, and I
recall seeing a message about 6 months ago (?) about a
1-800 number for windshields that were about $70.  I
cannot find anything about this now, and all the glass
shops around town want to charge around 150-300$!! 
Does anyone remember what that number was, or the
company?  

thanks
