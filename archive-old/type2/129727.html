&gt; Actually, the moral is that if you need to have someone else touch

...and if you can't help it, ask a local, reputable ACVW shop to 
recommend a place.  I went to a Firestone shop in Berkeley recommended 
to me by the guys at Buslab.  This particular chain tire shop sees a 
lot of Type 2s, and thus they carried tires that were appropriate for a 
late bay Westy and their tire techs know how to find reverse and not to 
over-torque the lug nuts.
