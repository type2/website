Subject: Auburn Hills Show and hubcap

Volks,

As I mentioned in my trip report, I am now the custodian of the hubcap.  I
would like to get it to the Auburn Hills show near Detroit on the 20/21st,
but am gonna have trouble driving that far on that weekend.  What I would
like to know is if there is anyone east of/in the Appalachians who will be
headed for  that show.  If you are, let me know and i will make the
connection this weekend or next and you can bring it to Detroit.  Thanks
in advance!
