&gt;&gt;Larry (at GEX) put a small disk, about the size of a dime on the engine for
&gt;&gt;abuse detection... If the engine is overheated, the center of the disk
&gt;&gt;melts. This shows weather the engine has been mistreated or not.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;Nope, I didn't say GEX put the disk on. I said that AVP (where my
&gt;rebuilt came from) put it on, and wondered why GEX doesn't do this.

GEX does.  Little disk that says &quot;Warranty void if removed&quot;
