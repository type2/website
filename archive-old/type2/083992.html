This has been covered many times. I think it was Karl who told us that
the No. 1 cause of trouble is bad points and No. 2 is a loose head temp
sensor or its wire.

&gt; After 4 phone calls and a check list longer than a cat's tail they are
&gt; running.  Not real well, but it should be enough to get them to my house
&gt; for a proper tune-up/diagnostics.

&gt; Thanks so much for all the help.  I'm not really sure what did the
&gt; trick, but I suspect it was &quot;chopper&quot;'s suggested loose head temp
&gt; sensor.
