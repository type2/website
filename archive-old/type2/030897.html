&gt; (i have a 1972 1700cc Pancake, twin weber carbs) Everyone seems to be telling

well for my nickel,  I always changed my mechanicals to an electric, and I
have been pushing air cooled up the road for 30+ years.  I don't remember
any electric ever failing on me.  and besides you could carry an extra and
install it in 15 minutes on the side of the road.

I actually liked being able to hear em, that way I knew it was working,
but hear it over the sound of the engine, no way!  quiet clicking noise
was all there was, if you don't put it in the passenger comp. which would
be crazy I can't imangine hearing it.

but as they say, opinions are free, and you get what you pay for!

&gt; sick of this reoccuring problem, should I just order a new flange, gaskets, 
&gt; pushrod, and pump (but which one?!) and replace all that crap?

naahhh!  get an electric and be done with it!
