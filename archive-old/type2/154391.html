Subject: Re: [T2] fuel injector seal dropped into intake

&gt;   IF the seal would have gotten stuck into the cylinder, what then? I know 
&gt; the BEST thing would be to remove the head and get it out, BUT would it do 
&gt; terrible damage to leave it in and burn it up? Would it burn up or just 
&gt; create permanent goo in the cylinder?
&gt;
&gt;

I dunno if I would leave the seal in there....  you can clearly see into the 
cylinder thru the spark plug hole... I would think you could bring the 
piston near TDC.. that would place the seal under the plug hole... and you 
could fab up a little fishing hook from wire ,, or maybe use one of those 
flexible expanding claw devices..

just my speculation!
