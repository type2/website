&gt; Problem 1: The wiring from the alternator has five parts:

I think you'll find that black wire does nothing,, it may have once been connected
to the diagnostic testing connector on the ceiling in your engine bay.....

It was connected to the alt B+ connection and is always live!  I recommend
disconnecting it and taping it aside.

Hopefully it is not the BLUE wire that connects to the D+ terminal [that you didn't
mention]
The blue wire is for the dash lamp,, and is required for the charging system to operate
