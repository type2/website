Subject: Size of bolt  that holds timing scale in place

Thanks to advice from several listees I was able to acquire the timing scale
(and the fan inlet screen) for my '78 westy.  The local dealer had them.  I
was shocked and amazed they would have anything for an ACVW.

The question now is the size of bolt that holds these things in place??

Thanks,

Dave
