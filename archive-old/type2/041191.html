Subject: Type 4 cam wear

Hi,
My camshaft has a slight depression on the toe(the peak) sort of
looks like the one in Tom Wilsons book on page 97.
As far as I understand after its worn this far its though
the hardened surface and it will wear faster now right?
I plan to replace it but was wanting to wait awhile longer.

My questions are...
How much longer I can use this cam? is it ok for another 5,000 miles?
I have hydraulic lifters so shouldn't they readjust to a depressed
cam lobe?
Whats the bad side of not replacing it?

thanks for any help, you guys are great!
