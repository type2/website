Subject: Need ac outlet block for 78 Westfalia

	I have a 1978 Westfalia camper bus. It has a stove. It used 
to have a refrigerator. The previous owner removed many of the 
electrical components including removing the wires from the outside 
ac plug, most refrigeration components, and any ac outlets that may 
have been present.

	My friend tells me I need an AC only outlet block (none of my 
dc outlets presently work). However, I would accept an AC/DC outlet 
block as well.

	I think an alternative would be for me to install a circuit 
breaker and a GFI outlet. Anyone suggest I do that instead?

	There is a 4.5 by 7.5 hole in the wood paneling under the 
rear seat that I think is designed to hold this outlet block. The 
hole is between the access door and the driver's side of the bus.

	If you have any working parts that I could use to reinstate 
an ac connection, please net me know what you have, its size, 
condition and price. (I intend to put in the reserve battery, relay 
kit, and dc outlet from the relay kit later).
