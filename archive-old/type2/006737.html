&gt;Does anyone know how many amps a dometic draws? I'm looking to get a power

Joe,
  The formula is wattage = voltage X current
  Which is the same as current = wattage/voltage
Most appliances are rated in wattage on a tag somewhere on the appliance.
So if you look at a fridge and it is rated at 1200 watts, then:
  current = 1200 watts/120 volts =  10 amps
Hope this helps.
