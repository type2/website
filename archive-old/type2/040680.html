Hello Everyone,

Just a quick question.  I already have the Muir &quot;How to Keep Your VW Alive&quot;
and the Bentley &quot;Official Service Manual.&quot;  Curious if anyone else has a
reference/repair manual that they like or would be willing to suggest.
Seems like a lot of jobs are just in between the target audience of these
two references.

Thanks,
