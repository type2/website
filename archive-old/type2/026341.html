-I have occasionally(and I stress the word) used graphite(from a drawing
pencil) on the edges of a plug that was a tight fit.  Tim is correct about
the anti-sieze.  The stuff is like the plague.  Once it's there, it's almost
impossible to clean up.

That's a hell of a good reason to do a compression test BEFORE you even ask
how much they want, much less buy into unknowns that can so simply be known.

If the motor has good compression and is running stock, I would pull the
plugs and adjust valves every 10k or 2 years 'till I knew THAT engine. Many
times a cylinder will be weak and regular maintenance inspections will show
a need to replace that plug every 5k. So adjust your inspections to the
actual condition of your motor via actual inspection. 

It's convienent to do valve adjustment when ever you replace the plugs so
it's easy to turn the motor by hand, but if the valves are not uniformly
quiet and giving a little noise, now is the time to check/adjust them, and
holding pressure against the alt belt and a bit more work to turn the motor
is really not a big deal.  What is important is to stop the excessive wear
that comes from non-spec valve clearances. If you ever need to adjust more
than 2 valves during a regular maintenance interval, you must reduce the
interval, but only if you want all the life the parts are designed to give.

And I say no, a thousand times no, to anti-seize on spark plug threads. It
goes dry, particularly when left in more than 10k. It is simply not
designed for this application. Anything in your materials or procedures
that prevents being able to turn the plugs out and in by hand ist verboten.
Two drops of light oil ist beste for regular maintenance of not only the
plugs, but the threads in the heads. Correct torque should not be guessed
at by egos, only by rote skill. Use a torque wrench until you know the feel
of the crush washer, both when new and subsequent torquing. You can torque
them three or more times without hurting anything, but only with experience.


If you find after removing a plug with difficulty gooey, pasty,
turning-to-plastic anti-seize be sure to chase that thread or the next
install or removal could be spendy. VERY hard on cost per mile, unnecessary
failures being what they are, always an afterthought.
