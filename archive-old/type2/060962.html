Subject: Re: GEX engine comments

from digest #680? jeffs letter:
&quot;BTW, this engine is a GEX
rebuilt,( the letters GEX are stamped in the case)
which now has 74.5K on it, if PO is to be believed.
 If its still running when I pull it, I may offer to
sell it back to them, as this has to be a record for
one of their engines, as 3-5K seems to be the norm.&quot;

Have people on the list had problems with this brand of rebuild? I have a GEX 1600
dual port that runs great, now with 60,000+ miles. Are these guys notorious for
shoddy workmanship?
