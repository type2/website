&gt;Below the instrument panel on our 71 bus are the ominous German words:
&gt;
&gt;        Fahren nur mit verreigelter Schiebetur.

The correct transation is of course:

&quot;Drive only with sliding door locked.&quot;

The language purists might argue that (both in the German and English text)
it does not tell you to lock the door in the closed position :-)  But I
think we can safely assume the German engineers meant for you to keep it
latched shut whilst the vehicle is moving.
