&gt;Subject: Re: [T2] How to keep a healthy fuel tank??

This may be old news, and I dont know about new tanks, BUT:

When the VW designers thought up our fuel tanks (now this is my knowldge of 
1970 tanks and back, so YMMV with a newer tank)

They designed the outlet valve to be higher then the tank itself. In other 
words, the outlet pipe sticks UP into the tank by approx a inch. The idea 
was that this way sediment wouldnt flow into your engine. The problem with 
this approch was that water setteled to the bottom, and then caused rust. I 
always cut this tube down to the hieght of the tank.
Maybe this will help, and maybe this will be answered already.
