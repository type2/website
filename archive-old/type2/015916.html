&gt;O.K. Volks, I've seen a few posts asking for where ya get this stuff, I
have no idea of quality or anysuch, I don't even own a westie, but they do
have a cool online catalog.  Heres a link that I got off this list.  If
anyone has any actual experience with these people now would be a good time
to post.
