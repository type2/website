Subject: Silver socket wattage

Previously I wrote:

&gt; Does anyone know more about the silver socket in the Westfalia dash? I've
&gt; been trying to find out more about it for a while but only found one person
&gt; mentioned on a website and I've been unable to contact him.

Thanks to everyone that replied. Does anyone remember how it's wired up
behind the dash? Where is it fused and how much wattage can it safely
handle?

BTW, the camper supplement doesn't show a 12v socket beside the circuit
breaker under the rear bench. My bus has this and I'm wondering if it's a
Canadian addition or if it was put in by a PO.
