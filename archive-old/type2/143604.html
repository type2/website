&gt; . To get me on the road --- could I use this setup as a single circuit
&gt; system for a while? There are two ports each for the front and rear
&gt; circuits, if the front circuit is not working at all would moving both
&gt; front and rear to the back circuit cause me to have too much pedal travel
&gt; due to trying to move the extra fluid out to the wheel cylinders?
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Is the larger '74 booster a bolt-on replacement on a '73 beam? I can rob
&gt; the '74 of its system to get me going again.
&gt;

Hello Gerald   The first might work but not real good and not the best way, 
easiest and cheapest yes      the later bay boosters had a different bolt 
pattern if I remember correctly.  you could cut the plate off the later axle and 
weld it to yours . the master clys were the same  later  mark
