&quot;Legislation (A.B. 616) has been introduced in the California Assembly by Assemblyman Dave Jones to require annual Smog check inspections for vehicles 15-years old and older&quot;.

Like the site said....&quot;Here we go again&quot;!!!!   I remember the back and forth they did in the 90's and that was one of the reasons I stupidly sold my '67 bus, because I was always driving around with expired tags. I have dual kadrons now, and I guess I won't be getting rid of my stock carb and manifold anytime soon! 
   
  I think I might be joining Karl and moving my boat and bus up north soon!!
