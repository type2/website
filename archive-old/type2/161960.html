Subject: Loose pushrod on a 75 auto westy

Hi Volks,

A local westy owner asked me to have a look at his bus today, he said  
it was getting a bit loud so asked me to adjust the valves. It's a  
solid lifter 1.8L FI engine and the owner usually gets me to do minor  
tuneups for him pretty regularly.

On pulling off the 3-4 side valve cover the problem was instantly  
clear: the #4 intake rocker was loose on the pushrod. There was about  
a quarter inch of play on the rocker where I would normally expect  
six thousandths of an inch.

Here are the facts:
- The valve spring was not any more compressed than the other  
springs. (That tells me it's not a dropped seat)
- Compression was 120PSI.
- The pushrod was not bent and was the same length as the exhaust  
valve pushrod.
- The #2  intake valve is working fine. (so It's not the camshaft)
- Adjusting the rocker all the way in managed to deliver .006&quot;  
clearance, but there is NOTHING left on the adjuster.
- The idle is very lumpy, and pulling #4 plug wire has no impact on  
idle.
- The engine was rebuilt by a local shop that I am not familiar with  
at the end of last summer; this bus is not winter driven.

Right now I think the problem is with the lifter... I didn't have  
time to pull the pushrod tube today and didn't bring a magnet either  
so lifter diagnosis will have to wait.

Any recommendations on where to go with this from here would be  
appreciated. I don't have time or space to pull the engine, but might  
be able to do the repair if it's something that can be handled  
without dropping the engine or pulling the head.

Happy trails,
