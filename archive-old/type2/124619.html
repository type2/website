Subject: Re: [T2] Jack

I, too, don't trust that stock jack as far as I can throw 2 busses! I
tried that jack when I first bought my bus and it fell right over.
I now carry (under the rear seat in my Westy) a scissor jack from, you
guessed it, Bus Depot. It is stable and useful. It even fits my
Beetle, too.
Not a bad deal at all.
