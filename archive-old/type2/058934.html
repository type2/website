Subject: Re: Taking first LD trip.

I have a 75 Westy.  The only problems I have with the cross country
trips is starting at altitude.  This first struck me in Bryce Canyon
in the middle of the winter.  I was baffled until I called a shop.
He said to give it more air.  I pulled the connector on the cold start
valve, and pulled a large vacuum line out.  It started and then died
before I could plug the vacuum hose back in.  Starts right up.
That did the trick.  There is no altitude sensor on the '75 FI system.
I've been thinking about adding a T to one of the big hoses and an
electric valve.  But that's alot of work when I'm down here at sea
level where it's nice and warm...

Check your fuel lines.  If they're marginal, but holding where it's
warm, they might not at altitude.  I've had to replace all my lines..

Carry what tools you can.  Carry spare igition tuneup parts.  Spare
belt, oil.  Jumper cables.  I like to carry a spare ignition coil,
fuel filter.  I should carry a spare fuel pump, but don't.  I had one
go on me about 150 miles east of Phoenix in the desert.  Luckily I
had just gotten back onto a real road and was only about a mile or
so from town where I was able to phone a friend and beg her to buy
a pump and drive it out to me so I could drive back to Pheonix to
catch a plane back home for some turkey.

Carry a hanky for the tears you'll shed as each rock leaves its
special mark on your front end or windshield :-(

Have a good trip (I love the cross country adventures!)
