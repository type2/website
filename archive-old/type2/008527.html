Pedro - I was talking about stock heads but these definitely caught my
attention.  Too bad they were not available 4 -6 months ago when I called
them about heads and big bore kits.  By the way (BTW), they did not have
any pistons bigger than my stock for 2.0 - 94mm when I called and did not
recommend them due to heat I believe, so I was a little surprised that
they were listed in the ad.  Why did they change their tune?

Now the 104mm look like a different breed since they claim 30% larger
cooling fins - although I'd consider a bigger oil cooler with this size
engine.

You would have to check with them, to see if it is a&quot;simple&quot; bolt on for
your 1.6L (1.7?) that you have.  If you have carbs they possibly
(probably) might have to be upgraded.  F.I. probably would have to be
modified to flow more fuel, since with their high-end heads, they said I
would need to do that and that's with stock bore.  Improvements in
induction should be might need to be matched by improvements to the
exhaust too - at least my van would need them.  If you go for it, keep me
posted by E-mail!
