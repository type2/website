Subject: Re: [T2] Buses And Punkin Chunkin in the First State

Volks,

For anyone who has not been...  I recommend this HIGHLY!!!!  It's the most
fun I have had while standing up (and that was legal :-)!

First, the sight of an honest to goodness trebuchet in action is awesome
second, these folks have a terrific site and (usually) terrific weater and
third, there are three words they have never heard...

                           Range Safety Officer :-)

Eventually someone is gonna get beaned at this event and that will end or
severly modify it, but until then, you can get within *way* too few feet
of ancient war machines in action at this event!  BTW, the web site for
the punkin chunkin event is at:

http://www.worldchampionshippunkinchunkin_dot_com/

I *will* be attending the chunkin, but as I explained to Dave, I will not
be camping (my folks live too close and they get offended if I don't
visit) so look for the short fat bald guy with the list T-shirt!!
