Subject: Adding Warm air to a Weber Progressive

Has anybody had any success adding a source for warm intake air ? Any other
suggestions to manage the icing ? I see that you can buy an adaptor for the
carb that allows you to use a two stage air cleaner - any one out there
using this set up?

Thanks
Eric
