Hi all,
    I'm getting ready to put together a 79, 2liter, engine.  While 
inspecting the connecting rods I didn't see the raised marks on the 
shanks,that should be on the top side.  Tom Wilson, in a photo caption on 
page 44 of his book, says that type 4 rods do not have these bumps.  I'm 
confused because the Bentley manual doesn't say anything about the type 4 
rods being exempt from having these marks.
    I've searched the archives but can't find the info I need, so I'm asking 
all of you.  Must there be a raised mark on my connecting rods to indicate 
the top, or can they go in either way ?

   Thanks in advance,
   Paul A.
