Better check your VW over from front to back Doc, and remove any non-genuine
parts, I'm sure you wouldn't want to offend VW. Can't be a devil's advocate
without taking the full plunge.

&gt; &gt;If you look at the evidence of what's going on, there is more on one end
of
&gt; &gt;the scale than the other.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; To this point in time the evidence has yet to be presented in whole to a
&gt; competant judge. Grasping at assumptions before the facts are presented
&gt; cannot be wholly representative of truth based upon proof.
&gt;
&gt; What do you think would happen if I started producing gym shoes with the
&gt; Nike swatch on them?? That's Nike's logo. The V and W in the circle is
&gt; exactly the same to VW. If they don't defend their rights to use it, they
&gt; will surely loose control of their image. All the original report said was
&gt; they were looking into it, and cooperating very nicely with all involved.
&gt; They simply are not a villian in my mind at this point for determining to
&gt; what extent their rights have been violated.
