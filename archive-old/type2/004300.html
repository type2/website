This is my first post and I hope it works. 

I have a leak in my water tank on my ' 76 Westfalia and I have had no 
luck finding a replacement.  The problem is the tank is cracked both 
where the pump and the drain hose connects to the bottem of the tank.  I 
have tried many different thing, but nothing seems to work.  Has anyone 
had this problem and know a way to fix it or know where I can get a new 
tank? 

It's not a major problem, but it sure does suck when I forget the leak 
is there and fill the tank for a weekend camping trip and the floor is 
all wet the rest of the time.

Thanks,
Jonathan
