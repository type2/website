Sorry to drag this out of the woodwork...

Yesterday I spent the better part of the evening trying to get the coil over
shocks off my 78 Westy. Ever since I got it from the PO it made some strange
clunks when going over bumps, etc... Turns out that the right one was just
loose at the bottom (!) but the top bolt on the left one just turns and
turns and turns. You can grab the shock now that the bottom bolt is out and
pull it every which way - a broken shock mount I'm thinking.

Does anyone know the approx. to repair this? The local Vdub shop said
anywhere between $75 and $250. Quite a range! Can anyone tell me how much it
cost them to fix this? I am assuming I can;t do it myself unless I get the
garage and welding equipment I've always wanted!
