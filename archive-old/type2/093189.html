Subject: Re: [T2] Neat light addition but disables door light:


&gt;&gt;I bought a 400 watt inverter for my westy locally for $60CDN/US$40.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I haven't tried it with power tools yet.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I used mine to power my drill one day when i was working in the bus. It 
&gt;worked fine. I drilled a bit of the wood off my z-bed so i could open it 
&gt;while my westy table leg was still installed. Makes things a lot easier 
&gt;that way.

Took mine out to the country and used my Sawz-All to cut out the motor 
mounts I needed from a junk bus. I was WAY to far from any power sources. 
Took 25 minutes to get all my work done, including clean up. With a hacksaw 
it would have taken well over a couple hours.

Mine is a 1995 600 W inverter. Be SURE that the fan will run when the 
inverter gets hot or when the inverter is on. Mine NEVER ran since I bought 
it new but I never thought anything about it. My normal loads have been 
short uses of a small drill or to power a light in a parking lot so it 
never got hot - just warm.

This time I was running the inverter at 100% with no fan. It got WAY hot. 
As soon as I got home I took it apart and wired the fan to come on anytime 
the power switch was on. Could have been an expensive lesson in inverter 
replacement (I bought mine back when 600 W inverters were $350).

Mine will run my Milwaukee 1/2&quot; drill or my Milwaukee Sawz-All but the 
startup load limit is easy to exceed. I start the tools with no load and 
with a slow application of throttle. Also neither tool can be run at 100% 
or it will trip the over current safety or blow the fuses or both. My 
Sawz-all has a throttle limit dial 1-9 (I think 9) and I can only run it at 
3 or 4.

For the trip out to the country last week I had to run the engine of my 
Honda CR-V b/c the battery is rather small on that car. The alternator 
would pull the idle speed down until the computer compensated for the load.

When I was in the Navy and using this inverter to work on my car in the 
parking lot or over at the storage unit I rented we could run the inverter 
to power a drop light and small drill for hours (short bursts of the drill 
only). This was on a large typical car battery. Eventually the inverter's 
low battery alarm would come on and we knew it was time to go for dinner or 
something to get the battery charged back up.

One of the neatest tools I've ever bought.
