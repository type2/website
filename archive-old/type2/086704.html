Subject: more 79 cali distributor 

OK more opinions requested here. To recap, 78 2L rebuilt with about 15K on
it, stock FI, 140psi comp all around. I upgraded to a 79 Calif distributor
electronic ignition setup. The coil is still the Bosch Blue but will be
replaced with a electronic ignition coil (what years Rabbit and Audi are
correct?).

The question is timing. My mechanic had me connect the vac advance and cap
the retard. He then timed it to 8 BTDC at idle. It runs great.

He said I didn't need the retard. When I pressed him on it he pointed out
that I didn't have my EGR connected and I had a 78 engine, cam and FI
brain. I shouldn't connect the retard with a setup like that since things
were different on the 79 Calif FI brain. A recent thread said that this
timing is pretty close when your not using the retard, tho I think it's a
little retarded. The correct timing with the retard vac connected is 5
ATDC. I haven't checked what my total advance is at 3600RPM, the specs say
it should be 21-25 with this distributor.

Opinions? I don't have all the parts for the EGR which I really should get
hooked up since it cools the engine, but is the 78 Fed engine/FI different
enough from the 79 CA engine/FI that I should NOT connect the retard
vaccuum and reset the time to correct specs?

Thanks
