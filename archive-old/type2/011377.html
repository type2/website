&gt;Subject: [T2] DPD Air Conditioning unit

&gt;I recently bought a '69 Bus and was suprised to find this cool a/c unit
&gt;under the dash. This is my first air-cooled VW and am unfamiliar with all
&gt;these spiffy after-market add on's. I'm getting totally obsessed with
fixing
&gt;my Bus and buying manuals; thus, my question:

&gt;Is there anyone out there with spec sheets or and operating manual for this
&gt;a/c unit. It was installed in the Bus in '72 in San Antonio, TX. I looked
&gt;all through the archives and found some interesting info, but no leads in
my
&gt;direction. The company seems to be defunct-at least no where to be found in
&gt;San Antonio. I'll pay for xerox copies and shipping (I live in Austin).

There were mainly two brands of ac units that were used by Texas VW dealers
back in the olden days.
VPC was the most common and was supplied by the VW parts warehouse.  DPD was
an independent
company but a lot of their units were used.  The two brands were fairly
similar and were both pretty simple.
They both used thermostatic expansion valves (TXV,s) and a thermostatic
clutch cycling switch to control
the temperature of the evaporator.  Many parts were generic and can still be
found at ac supply places.
They probably won't have parts lists for the DPD brand, but will be able to
match most things.
About the only thing that was a constant problem was the high current flow
through the switches.  The only
relay was a main supply so the switches had to carry full current.  Good
connections are a must or heat
build-up will melt stuff.  There are ways to re-engineer the system to use
relays to control everything and get
around this problem.
I'm currently working on the DPD unit in a type I, which is very similar to
the type II unit, and have been able to find everything except the
compressor drive belt.  It's a weird belt with a much sharper &quot;V&quot; angle.
Does anyone know of a source for these belts?
If I can help with advice on the ac system, just let me know.  I'll be glad
to try.
