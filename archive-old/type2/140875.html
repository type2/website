&gt; I found the little blue electrical connector to the... I think the cold idle jet, on the intake manifold was
loose and didn't have the wire clip to hold it on.  Could that be all it was?  Maybe a fuel delivery issue of
some kind???  It runs pretty well once it's started.

The blue connector goes to the cold start valve. You really really need that cold start valve to be working on
a cold start. Hence the name 'cold start valve' :)

Sounds like that is all that is wrong.
