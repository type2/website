Subject: Re: [T2] full/high speed operation revisited

Old cars (and old busses) are like old people. They should be cared
for, not pushed too hard or too far, too fast. I know it's not very
healtyhy mentally to personify inaminate mechanical things, but I've
found that old cars run better when you aren't too hard on them. They
need a gentle warm up and should be in good condition before you make
them go the distance.
