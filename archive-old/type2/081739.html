Subject: EB02

Greetings all,
    My son and I attended the EB02 and had a great time. It was a very well
done event, and the Burritos were top notch.
    I would like to thank everyone for being such a wonderful group to
associate with. I was really unsure as to what a crowd of VW Bus folks would
be like since this was my first outing. I was very pleased to find that all
were very friendly and kind, and noone got too crazy after consuming adult
beverages or other stuff.
    I am new to the Bus scene and I really enjoyed the opportunity to look
into everyone's busses, new and old. The people were all so kind and readily
allowed me and my son to &quot;snoop&quot; around. I got some great ideas for my bus.
Now my job is to convince my wife that I really, really need all that stuff.
    After talking with several people at EB, I have decided on a name for my
bus. As you all know, it is probably easier to name your first child than
your bus. But, I have decided to call my bus...Drumroll please....
Ma chérie
The reasons are as follows:
1. My wife calls my bus &quot;My other woman&quot;. Ma chérie translates to My
darling
2. My wife's first name is Sherry.
3. I plan to paint her (my bus) Cherry Red and White.
4. I work for a Canadian company based in Montreal, and while I was up there
training, I met some great VW folks, Les Wests.

That's all for now, I look forward to more events
Later,
Jim
