I dont really know all the rules of this e-mail list, but owning a
volkswagen is a wonderful thing and even more than that talking about
volkswagens is more of a wonderful thing and when I see the administrator
of the list tell someone they can no longer talk about something like
sightings of a volkswagen this no longer becomes fun. And really makes me
question why I subscribed to this list. The technical info is great, but
human beings are not technical all the time and we should be able to
discuss freely our interests in volkswagens whether it be valve adjustments
or bus sightings or anything volkswagen related. However I do know that it
is a priviledge to post to this e-mail list and that there are rules and
because of this I ask that I be removed from this list.
