Subject: 71 crew cab wiriing question

Hello Everyone!

Thanks for all those who e-mailed me help before.
Well, I finally have my Corvair powered Crew cab up and running (please note: 
I did NOT convert it).There are still several Bugs to work out but the one 
upside is that this truck hauls a$$!  Whoa!  Talk about power!  Anyways, on 
to my questions.  As usual, please respond via e-mail because I seldom get to 
read the list and may miss your replies.
Wiring:  I'm trying to trace wires but my Bently manual does not match in 
some instances.  I have a large black power wire that is suposed to go to the 
rear defrost but I can't seem to find that switch!  My truck is a 71 and has 
Headlights, wipers, emergency flashers, and interior light switches on the 
dash.  There is NO other hole for a defrost. Where would this switch be 
located on the dash?  1971 Busses that I've seen have Defrost knobs where 
mine has the interior switch.  Maybe it's a truck thing.  I also have a black 
wire paired with a red wire that is cut under my dash.  Could this be the 
interior light wiring?  Any direction would be appreciated.
Lastly, how can one check if an alternator and/or an external regulator are 
working?  My NEW battery keeps dying yet my AMP guage always shows 15 amps or 
so.
