Subject: rough idle

Great and powerful list,

Been having trouble with the idle on my 74 Westy with a 79 FI engine. It is
currently idling rough. At first I though it was a vacuum problem but have
gone over the entire hose network and everything is tight and no hoses have
fallen off anything. My thoughts are possibly the EGR valve not seating well
or perhaps a problem with the auxiliary air valve. The problem arose after
some 600+ miles driven to Wisconsin and back with the engine running a
little on the warm side( 230-235). If any one has any ideas what to check
first I would appreciate the help. thanks, Dana
