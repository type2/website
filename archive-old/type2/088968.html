Subject: Re: [T2]  New Microbus ( S A V W )

&gt; Get over it.  No, it's not an old Bus. There will never again be an old
Bus.

There is nothing for me &quot;to get over&quot;. I never said that the new bus was
trying to be the old bus. All I was saying was that people are going to
think they are in the &quot;club&quot; of buses when all they have is a souped up Audi
with none of the Bus heritage.

&gt; But, if the New Microbus is a success, it is a good thing for old Bus
owners
&gt; like us.  Like the New Beetle, the New Microbus will likely cause a
&gt; resurgance of interest in the original Bus.  For a while, this will result
&gt; in an increase in the popularity (and, incidentally, the resale value) of
&gt; old busses,

Great so those of us who have been buying buses because they are a cheap
good vehicle will now have to pay alot more for them, what's so good about
that?


&gt; just as the New Beetle did for the old one.

That made alot of die hard VW people happy, prices for Beetles and parts
went up alot when this new &quot;Beetle craze&quot; happened.

&gt;
&gt; Why do you care?  Well, let's face it - there are fewer busses on the road
&gt; every day.  This means less demand for parts, which means that some parts
&gt; are going out of production or getting scarce.  Over time, this translates
&gt; into substantially higher prices for bus parts, or lower quality, or both.
&gt; Not a good thing.

I will agree to that.

&gt; For example, we had a close call recently, when Pagid
&gt; (the only remaining German brake shoe supplier) decided to discontinue all
&gt; Bus brake shoes due to declining sales - a decision that they eventually
&gt; reversed (for now).  Had it happened, only resurfaced shoes would have
been
&gt; available for busses - not for a while, but forever!  What's more, the
&gt; resurfaced shoes would have gradually gone up in price; right now the
&gt; existence of new shoes at a certain price imposes a &quot;ceiling&quot; on the price
&gt; of resurfaced ones.  So within a few years, you'd be paying more for
&gt; resurfaced shoes than you are now for new ones.  This trend toward reduced
&gt; parts availability is already well underway with splitty parts, and will
&gt; happen with later bus parts as well (as it does with parts for any vintage
&gt; car whose numbers on the road are declining).

This is true also, but you can still find parts for MOST cars that people
collect.

&gt;
&gt; Anything that brings with it a renewed interest in old busses will slow
this
&gt; inevitable process.  Lots of media attention about the Bus will keep more
of
&gt; them on the road.  Suddenly they're &quot;classics&quot; to more people, worth
&gt; repairing, rather than being sent to the junkyard as a worthless &quot;jalopy&quot;
&gt; when the engine drops a valve or the rocker panels rust.  Suddenly that
bus
&gt; in the backyard under the tarp is worth uncovering and restoring (or
&gt; selling) rather than being left to rust into oblivion.  The more busses
that
&gt; remain on the road (or get put back on the road), the better it is for bus
&gt; owners.
&gt;
&gt; So is it going to make a huge difference?  Probably not.

So what you are saying is that all the points you have made dont really
matter and that if the new bus hurts or helps, things wont change.

&gt; But there's no
&gt; downside to it, either.  Renewed interest in the Bus can only help, not
&gt; hurt, bus owners.

Actually it can, for those of us that are looking to buy another bus in the
future. How does it help me when I am looking at a bus now that is $1000 but
it will be $3000 in 3 years just because some yahoo thinks it would be
really cool to do up a 73 just like his new 2004 VW &quot;microbus&quot;.

&gt; The better question is, will the New Microbus be successful like the New
Beetle was?  That's a good question. VW is pretty sure of it, as they're
planning some pretty serious production volume for the U.S. market.  But the
New Microbus (as presented so far) does have a couple of notable flaws that
the New Beetle didn't have.  One is the styling, which is not nearly as
evocative of the old Bus as the New Beetle was of the old one.  Merely
calling it a &quot;bus&quot; does not guarantee that it will tug on the heartstrings
of people who fondly remember the old bus.  Secondly, pricing.  While other
successful &quot;retro&quot; vehicles (Miata, New Beetle, PT Cruiser, New Mini) were
priced very affordably, the New Microbus will be somewhat expensive (about
$28k).  I think that Volkswagen may be underestimating how much of a factor
the low pricing was in the success of other popular &quot;retro&quot; vehicles
(including their own New Beetle).  So I think VW will have a steeper road to
climb this time around.  On the other hand, the New Microbus couldn't
possibly be as big a commercial failure in the U.S. as the EuroVan was, so
things can only get better.  And besides, it will draw the media's attention
to busses for at least a little while, regardless of whether it flies or
fizzles after that.&lt;

I agree with that, Bus owners have always been viewed as Hippies and losers,
now is a good chance to show we are normal everyday people who just love the
old buses.
&gt;
&gt; So bring 'em on!  I don't think I'll buy one myself, but here's hoping
lots
&gt; of people do!

Well if they have the money to buy one, more power to them.
