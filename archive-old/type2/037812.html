Subject: Re: nose mounted spare

Hey amigo. Your condition is normal. Do Not Space your spare tire away from 
the nose. The mount is only held on with sheet metal screws, to nothing but a 
sheet metal backing. The contact of the spare tire with the nose sheet metal 
actually helps distribute the weight of the spare tire. If you move it away 
from the nose, you'll likley tear the mount right out of the sheet metal, and 
this usually happens at SPEED! Not fun at all, and I know this first hand. 
The spare tire mount on late bay window busses was a dealer installed option, 
and they stopped doing it for the above stated reason. If your spare is on 
the nose, also be very carefull about not bumping into anything with it. It 
will do INCREDIBLE damage to the nose area, just ask me how I know.
Later, Parker
