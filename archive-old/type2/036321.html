Subject: VW hall sender

Hi, Does anyone have any experience with the 79 bus hall sender standard for
that year. I saw it in the VW parts manual. If it fits into a 78 distributor
would this not be a good substitute to a pertronix? VW quality at the same
price. What I would like to know is if this sender requires another
component to function or if it will function alone like the pertronix does.
Bob
