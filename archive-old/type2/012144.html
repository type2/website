Subject: shifter rear coupler
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

Well I ordered a coupler from the Bus Depot and
then had to go to my inlaws in Oregon for T day.
Got back on Friday (Late) to no part. Saturday
was the same story so I went to Bow Wow and bought what
they had. (Brazil) It is now installed but I had to use
the original sheet metal screw/sleeve that holds the rubber
bushings as the sheet metal screw in the new package was
made out of pot metal or something and when I tried to
screw it into the sleeve it just took the threads off as if
they wern't there! The &quot;rubber&quot; bushings in the new part
are hard
and transmitt the whine from the tranny which is annoying
so I plan on having the orignal Cage assembly spot welded
and I  will fab my own bushings if I cant find
replacements. This Brazil made part is really cheesey
folks!
