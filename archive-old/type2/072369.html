Subject: 12mm Fuel Hose

I am replacing all of my fuel hoses and have obtained several fathoms 
of 7mm, fuel injection rated, hose from the Bus Depot.

However, on my '76 2000 cc there is one section, from the fuel filter 
to the fuel pump, that is of bigger diameter. It looks to be about 
12mm (interior diameter), but I can not find any reference about it 
in any of the usual Type2/VW catalogs/web sites.

Before I run around town looking for a suitable hose, can anyone 
confirm that this is indeed 12mm ID?

Also what pressure rating should I purchase?

Thanks in advance for any information.
