You can get replacement original style &quot;horsehair&quot; padding.  Feels like
original, foam does not.  You need to put something in between the padding
and your original springs.

You can get them at www.partsvw_dot_com

follow this link:

www.busdepot_dot_com

, Rocky Mountain Motor Works or aircooled_dot_com probably have them as well.



Other option is to pull seats from Civic or Corolla or something, so long as
the track system comes with them, and fit flat, you can drill holes into the
wheel well, caulk them up and screw them down.

Subject: [T2] Replacing Insides of Seat &amp; Seat Back in '78 Westfalia
Deluxe


I am having the two front seats and seat backs of my '78 Westfalia restored.

My question concerns the &quot;insides&quot; of the seat and seat back.

I have no idea what my options are.  I want to have it done the &quot;right&quot; way.
What is the best product to replace the insides with?

David
