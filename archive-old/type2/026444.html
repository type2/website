Subject: More on tires.  And a Michelin tesimonial
Date: Thu, 5 Nov 1998 08:48:25 -0600 

Ok, I just can't resist any longer.  So I'm going to subject you all to
my own opinion and testimonial.

First off, bottom line, and I'm sure most of you will agree with me:
The number one cause of catastrophic or premature tire failure is
improper inflation.  If you run those puppies around with 15 pounds of
air in them for a few months, they're gonna pop.  The same goes for
over-inflating them.

The second most common cause of catastrophic tire failure is age.
Rubber breaks down with age and heat.  Doesn't matter if your tires have
500 or 50,000 miles on them, if they're more than 5 years old, their
getting to the point where they probably need replacing.  I know it's
hard to justify the $300-500 outlay when the tread still looks good, but
its usually the sidewalls that blow out, not the tread surface.

Unfortunately, a lot of times, tires sit in a warehouse for several
years before they are sold.  A few years back, I mail-ordered a set of
close-out Yokos for my 914.  They were cheap, I was poor, and I needed
new tires.  When I took them to the tire shop to be mounted, the guy
asked me what I paid.  I told him and asked him why.  He then told me
that the manufacture date on the tires was 4 years old!

Now, on to my Michelin testimonial:  I bought a set of inexpensive
Michelin's at SAMS about 3 1/2 years ago.  They're passenger tires and
only rated at 1300 lbs each.  Only 1 week after I put them on my 73
Westy, I had a nasty situation arise where I swerved hard left to avoid
broadsiding an idiot, then immediately put the bus up on 2 wheels to
avoid the oncoming traffic whose lane I found myself in, then managed to
put the bus up on the other 2 wheels before getting straigtened out.  I
feel certain that if I had lesser tires on the bus that I would have
torn them off the rims and/or flipped the bus.  Saved my ass.  Saved my
bus' ass (even if it does sag a bit).

And another testimonial:  A few weeks ago, my Mom had a blowout in a
Landrover Discovery with original Michelin tires with over 50,000 miles
on them (2160 lb load rating!).  She was going over 90mph and looked
over at my Dad and said, &quot;I think one of the tires may be low&quot;.  They
pulled over and the right rear tire was completely shreaded.  But the
rim was undamaged because what was left of the sidewall had stayed in
place and kept the rim from hitting the ground.  They just put 4 new
same-model Michelins on the Rover.  They're not cheap, but they're safe!

On the down side, I believe the sidewalls on my passenger tires to be
too soft for the weight/design of the bus.  It is not nearly as
solid-feeling on the highway as some other buses I've ridden in.  

The damned tread still has 1/2 its life left after 25,000
agressively-driven miles so I'm having trouble justifying replacement.
But when I do replace, I'm going for a LT tire with at least a 1500 lb
rating (more if I can find it).  And if I can find it in a Michelin then
that'll be my first choice.
