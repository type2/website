Subject: Maifest German car show in saint louis, May 21

Hello all,

For those of you that cant make the trek to the VWOA show in
michigan, there is an all german car show in Saint Louis the same day
(May 21.)  There is no entry fee and it is part of a german festival
including german music, beer food, dancing etc.  They expect to have
formula Vee racecars, porsche racecars etc. and of course Veedubs ;)

I have never been to this show, and dont know if it'll be great or a dud,
so take that FWIW.

the information on this can be found at the following URL:
http://www.dgi_dot_net/914/events/maifest.html 
(there is a map on this page as well)

If anyone is coming in from out of town, i would suggest camping at the
old site of busses by the arch, cherokee lakes campground.  it is close to
the show and a spot most people can find.  Be sure to call ahead and make
reservations!

here is the contact info:
Cherokee Lakes Campground
3950 Highway 79
O Fallon, MO 63366-5233
Phone: (636) 978-2147 

here is a link to a map:
http://www.worldpages_dot_com/bus/detail.whtml?record_id=10409478&amp;website_type=X&amp;name=cherokee%20lakes&amp;searchType=rid&amp;state=mo&amp;searchRegion=false&amp;newSearchURL=%2e%2f

The map isnt very detailed, but there is a link to &quot;get directions&quot; that
should help you find it! (and a printout of the map on the maifest page
will get you from the campground to the show.)

I will be out of the country until that friday, so i will be unable to
organize the camping at all, but will most likely be at the carshow.  This
will be one of those &quot;yer on your own&quot; things, maybe meet up with others,
maybe not.  I just wanted to alert everyone that this option was
available.

take care,

Steve White

p.s. i am not going to check my e-mail for another couple of weeks, so i
will be unable to answer questions, sorry.
