Guys,

So buy the stock and then have it ceramic coated?....

Something wrong with this scenario?  Think how long the stock one would 
last if you did that?

Stan Wilder's(list member) prices for ceramic coating seem pretty 
reasonable to me....

And if that's too much, then how about hi-temp powder coating?

Just a thought, dave

 Seconded.  My '72-'74 style Bugpack extractor has gotten horribly 
 rusted in the 1.5 years I've had it on my daily-driver Westy.  I've got 
 a couple of spares though, so at this rate I'll probably be fine until 
 2007.

&gt; Ceramic coating would make the aftermarket stuff last a lot longer, 
&gt; but the cost of extractor+muffler+coating is comparable to buying 
&gt; the stock-style muffler in the first place.
