Measure twice, cut once

   or

Stupid is as stupid does . . .

I bought a new AWIA CD AM/FM radio Saturday to replace the SONY that shorted 
out a few months ago.  In a hurry to get the new AWIA radio in, I pulled the 
old SONY out, pulled the glove compartment out (to get more finger playing 
room), cut the special SONY snap-on connectors from all four speakers, the 
power supply(s), and cut the ground cable, drilled a new hole for a ground 
cable, stripped all 10 wires so I could splice (twist wires together = 
splice, in my vocabulary) the four speakers, etc, stripped the AWIA 10 
wires, spliced (OK, twisted) all wires together, taped all splices with the 
black stretchy tape (swearing how cheap I am, not buying shrink wrap 
sleeves!!), attached ground and power supply(s) wires, and was all set to 
plug the newly wired module into the back of the AWIA.

Wait, maybe I better see how the AWIA fits into this new rectangular hole in 
my dash board.

      NOT ! ! ! !

'S' words galore!!  Now I have to look for another replacement SONY CR200 
old fashioned radio/cassette so that I can get some music and news again.  
And then start the rebuild process all over again.

But this time, I will measure twice . . . (or at LEAST once)
