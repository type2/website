Subject: RE: [T2] RMMW Catalog

&gt; Has anyone had any luck getting a RMMW catalog?
&gt; I've used their web form, called them and still nothing.


Motorworks is operating under Bankruptcy protection, and has downsized
significantly.  At one time they had nearly 200 employees, but I've heard
it's down to a couple of dozen now. Similarly, their catalog distribution
has been downsized (which is a smart cost-saving move in my opinion, as it
always seemed to me that a new catalog every month or two was a bit
unnecessary). But as far as I know they do still have them. They send them
via bulk mail, though, not first class as we do, so perhaps yours is just
slow in arriving.
