Plus, those little fans are loud as heck.  Maybe look for a aux. heater that
runs on gas  (try Robert at WarmerWagen)  if your heater channels are shot.

It the channels are ok, you can troubleshoot yourself and get it so hot in
your bus you will be on fire.  There probably is numerous leaks in the
system, as well as possibly cracked engine seals, etc that bring fumes in.
My VW's run stock heat, and I literally have to crack the window to turn it
down.

&gt; &gt;Has anybody heard of 'electric in-line heaters' for buses?  I have a 77
&gt; westy that I am thinking of cutting out those useless rusted heater boxes,
&gt; and would like to replace with a 'engine to muffler' combo.  Has anyone
&gt; heard of such a thing?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;A friend showed me the electric heaters in a catalog about a year ago,
but
&gt; neither one of us can find that catalog now.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Thanks,
&gt; &gt;Mike

&gt; It seems like a great idea but if you're thinking of an electric fan
heater
&gt; or the like, the amount of power you'd need to pull out of the
&gt; generator/battery would probably be too much to get anything useful. I had
&gt; an electric windscreen demister for my Beetle, but it was so pathetic I
&gt; demanded my money back.
&gt;
&gt; I suspect the in line heater you are thinking of is a fan you fit between
&gt; the heat exchangers and the cab. That is reported to be very effective,
but
&gt; you still need those heater boxes in good order.
