&gt; I'm helping a friend get an engine running and it looks like the oil
&gt; pressure is way too high.  Its a later dual relief 1600 case and has
an
&gt; aftermarket oil pump and oil filter.  The engine is blowing a steady
&gt; drip drip drip out of the flywheel oil seal.
&gt; 
&gt; Pulled the relief valve from the crank pulley end of the engine and it
&gt; was quite scored, cannot get the other relief valve out of the
cylinder.
&gt; 
&gt; If the relief valve(s) are stuck in the high position would this cause
&gt; the high oil pressure?  I had an uncalibrated gauge connected and it
&gt; showed about 60psi at idle. (if the nominal is 28 or so, you can see
my
&gt; concern.)

If the valves are stuck in the &quot;up&quot; position the pressure will be too
high.  The valves are pushed downward against spring pressure to
&quot;spill&quot; oil so as to keep the pressure down to a level determined by
the strenghth of the springs.

The valve on the rear end of the engine is the oil pressure relief
valve.  It allows high pressure oil to bypass the oil cooler when it
is cold and not flowing well.  This prevents oil cooler damage from
excessive pressure and serves as an oil temperature control.  If this
valve is stuck closed you risk oil cooler bursting and your oil
temperature will be too cold.

The valve on the front of the engine is the oil pressure control
valve. It is at the far end of the oil gallery and serves to dump
excess oil back to the crankcase. It limits oil pressure to the
bearings.  If it is stuck closed, it could cause excess oil delivery
to the bearings, which might leak out of the front seal.  This seems
to be your problem.

One way to get a valve out of its bore is to screw a tap into the
hollow end of the valve.  You can then pull on the tap and the valve
should pull out.

New valves are available.  Make sure that the bores are smooth and
that the new valve slides in and out easily.
