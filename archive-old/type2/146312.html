&gt; Another question: The heads on this engine have breather fittings on them
&gt; (to be connected to a central breather box somewhere in the engine
&gt; compartment). Looks like they were manufacturerd like that. Previous owner
&gt; says they are Brazilian heads. I have never seen anything like that before -
&gt; what are these heads?

hello marcus  the 914 heads are like that, but they only have 3 intake studs 
holding the intake manifolds.  As for carbs I would use either dells or 
webers.  Call me at my shop as I might have an extra set of dells  later  mark
