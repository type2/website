All,

   First of all I would like to say thanks to everyone that has been helping 
me out in this endeavor. A thanks to the list op for the BW.

   OK on the the questions.

1) Is there a good place I could see some pictures of a type 2 bus's engine 
in good shape?

   The reason I ask is I am new to this and am trying to identify a few 
parts.

2) I am in the process of removing my starter, does anyone know where the 
2nd screw is that I need to take off to remove the starter? I got the 
electrical part off as well as the screw under the bus. But I cant find the 
2nd screw.

3) There is a part that looks like a black can that has a few latches on it. 
It has two vents that face towards the back of the bus. It also has a tube 
that runs to the top of my carburetor. Can anyone tell me what this is? I 
would think it was the air filter but it has quite a bit of oil inside.

4) Last question for now. Newt to the oil cap there is a pipe that runs down 
under the bus to nowhere the other part of the tube attaches to a hose that 
goes to the part described in question number 3.

Thanks in advance to anyone who replies.

Joe

PS: If anyone is from the Delaware area and could help out. Let me know.
    I plan to put some money into this restore and would like to find  
someone fairly local that knows VW's well for I am a Newbie to this.
