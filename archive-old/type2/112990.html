Subject: swaybars

Don't know if you got his last time. Having puter problems. 



&gt;&gt;I looked at the pics and wanted to ask some questions...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;1) What was your source for the swaybars?
&gt;  
&gt;
www.aircooled_dot_net

&gt;&gt;2) Cost?
&gt;  
&gt;
Around $250.00 for the set.

&gt;&gt;3) Do you think the rear bar could have  shorter link? Could I shorten the 
&gt;&gt;links and still have the same function?
&gt;  
&gt;
I have been thinking about shorting the rear links. I can't see any draw back to it. I wrote the manufacture about the rear links and never got a reply. I have since put poly bushings on the front. I am going to play with the links in the rear sometime this fall..

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thanks for the great pics.
&gt;  
&gt;
If you lived closer I would let you drive it!!Handles GREAT!!!
