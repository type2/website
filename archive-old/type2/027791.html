Hi Volks,
   I just thought I'd share what I learned about window installation last 
weekend.  I know in the past I've seen posts about people not being able to 
get windows in so I thought I'd share my recent experience.
   Last sunday my wife Kathy and I decided to remove the window and vent 
window from the left, rear position in our 71 westy and install the one 
piece window (a right side window) and new seal that we bought just for that 
purpose.  After taking care of some rust, priming and painting, it was time 
to install the glass.  The seal was put on the window and then a length of 
1/4 inch diameter rope was layed into the outer groove in the seal.  Kathy 
went inside the bus and took the ends of the rope as I held the window up to 
the opening.  She pulled the ends, starting from the middle of the bottom 
edge, toward the lower corners.  As the rope pulled over the edge of the 
sheetmetal flange around the window hole, it pulls the edge of the seal over 
too.  As Kathy pulled the rope I pushed the window down and onto that lower 
flange.  So far so good.  Now, with the bottom edge on,  I pushed the window 
inward as she worked the rope up the front and rear sides.  It went pretty 
easy until we got to the middle of those sides.  Past that it took a lot 
more inward preasure.  In fact we had parked the bus about 18 inches from a 
6 foot high fence so that I could brace my back against the fence while I 
pushed.  Now we worked one rope at a time toward the top corners.  With the 
seal finally seated on the forward corner we could get the rope up to but 
not around the rear corner.  It seemed that this window would never fit in 
this hole.  We were taking a break and deciding what to do and I noticed 
something strange.  The window was actually bending.  I didn't know glass 
could bend, but you could see it and feel it by running your hand along the 
top of the window.  Then I had the bright idea of lubricating the outer edge 
of the seal.  Once I liberally sprayed the seal with silicone lubricant it 
went in with considerablly less force required!!!
   I'll be putting a new seal on the window in the rear hatch soon, and you 
can be sure I'll spray it up good right from the start.  I hope this helps 
some of you who wonder how to make window installation easier.
