Subject: Re: [T2] Wont start at all now...

Alright, here's my thought pattern on this. your van gets harder &amp;
harder to start the colder it gets. It would be a pretty good guess
that it might be something in the system that either reacts to heat[0]
or is supposed to help with a cold engine[1]. So your trouble shooting
should start there, but since you can't even get the engine to crank
looks like we should start there. 

We need to trace where the power is dropping out. Go dig through your
tools &amp; get your VOM. Crawl under the van. Verify that you have 12ish
volts on the big terminal of the starter, this is the one that leads
directly from the battery. If so (hopefully) the starter is getting
enough voltage to activate the solenoid &amp; turn the starter. Next, go
ahead &amp; take the van out of gear (just in case) &amp; disconnect the wire
that goes to one of the spade terminals, I believe on some vans there
are more than 1, &amp; if so more knowledgable people (w/ bentley in front
of them) can clarify. Either way, you will know you pulled the correct
one if the bus does nothing, shouldn't even click. Have someone turn
the key to start &amp; measure the voltage from the wire to ground. Still
should be in the 12v area. 

So if you get this far good chance it's a starter problem. Just to be
sure make sure all connections (especially on the starter terms) are
very clean. Even go so far as to take sandpaper &amp; knock off the
corrosion on them. Make sure everything is tight &amp; try again. I should
have said this earlier, but crawl under there &amp; really check your
grounding straps. There should be one between the battery &amp; chassis &amp;
one between the tranny &amp; chassis. Make damn sure these are in very
good shape, as a bad ground can wreck havock on the running of the bus
(another possible reason for the hard starts). 

Well at this point if your van still doesn't want to turn &amp; you can
verify that the starter gets a good healthy 12v from both the battery
&amp; when trying to start you need to pull the starter. Try this stuff
first.

&gt; Did I screw something up (see attached post)? I was cranking 
&gt; the starter for WAY too long. I tried the van today, and it 
&gt; wouldn't turn over at all... I turned the key and I just got 
&gt; a click. Its not the battery... the interior lights are 
&gt; bright but just to be sure I hooked it up to my running car 
&gt; to no avail.
&gt; 
&gt; Not to prejudice your responses but I have one of those WR1 
&gt; relay kits and I am wondering if I blew the fuse in it.... 
&gt; Has anyone replaced one of these? How do I test it?
