&gt; I don't think this is correct. I am not certain of the changeover year, but
&gt; on later models the fan is switched on when the heat lever is fully &quot;on&quot;,
&gt; all the way at the bottom. On these models there is a wire and contact on
&gt; the frame that carries the heater and fresh air controls, and the contact is
&gt; grounded by the heater lever, tripping the relay which starts the fan.

Sorry I wasn't clear. That was implied. I was just pointing out that no
alternator running condition was needed.
