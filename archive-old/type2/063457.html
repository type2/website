Untypical to &quot;VanBondo&quot; I dont have time to spin a proper tale.

1. I used a 68 single cab truck to haul full palettes of &quot;Superlite&quot; paving
bricks. The guy at the brick yard was unsure about it and made NO!!! guarantees.
I hauled four trips about 10 miles each. I was the original &quot;slam it to the
grond crowd.&quot; I would advize spending the delivery charge and have them
brought to me if it should ever need more bricks.

2. I worked at a restaurant during grad school. A young coworker told a
childhood story of her mother hauling a pygmy pony to horse shows in the
back of a sunroof micro bus! A little hay and slow in the corners and &quot;There
you go!&quot;
I always visualized the pony freaking out inside and start to kick. Other
natural possibilities would have encouraged me toward using a trailer.
Somehow Frank Zappa came to mind...

BTW: Jerome was a great success! Reports by attendees sure to follow!
