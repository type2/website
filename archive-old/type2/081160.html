Subject: Fw: ticking Engine on full power &amp; dropped valves

Thanks, I'll takje a look.

I hope it hasn't dropped a valve, because this'll be the second time in a
few thousand miles.

I've noticed a slight oil leak and the oil had got low, so I'm thinking that
the lack of power was
an overheating engine with low oil!

Does anyone know why these 2L engines drop valves so much?

&gt; Dont know for sure but a ticking was the first
&gt; indication
&gt; that I had dropped a valve seat on my 74.. which
&gt; has a type 4 1800. Same as yours I suspect. if you
&gt; are seeing puffs of smoke then thats another sign.
&gt; I suspect you should be able to pull the valve covers
&gt; and perhaps be able to see if all of the seats are
&gt; at the same level.. (brass looking color).
&gt; The loss of power is the only difference as I didnt
&gt; experience that symptom.
&gt;
