&gt;#1. The hole that the C.O. adjusting screw resides in is plugged with what

&gt;flush with the top of the hole.Is this an indication that 
&gt;the rebuilder has somehow calibrated this AFM so that the C.O. should be 
&gt;correct in most situations?

The factory AFMs had a blue cap in that spot. I bought one to plug my hole just for fun and when I tried to remove it I deformed it. I would guess that the dealers didn't replace them after tune-ups.

It's anybody's guess where the screw it set. I can backdown my screw to count how many turns gives me my perfect %CO reading...

&gt;#2 Looking at the top of the air cleaner box, next to the AFM, I have a 
&gt;phillips screw that has been driven into a hole that is angled so the screw 
&gt;points at the center of the air intake of the afm. Does this screw have a 
&gt;purpose other than filling the hole?

The 7 pin AFMs have an intake air sensor that is in the airstream so I would guess it doesn't matter much...
