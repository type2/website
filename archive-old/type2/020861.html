$58 seems steep for a lifter.  As for the spring clip coming out, I
suspect this is due to an adjustment that was too loose, allowing the
piston in the lifter to slap against the clip, a nono- but possible if
you do only one turn to adjust and then get wear in a cam lobe, pushrod
tip, adjustor bolt end, or valve end!
&gt; The little spring clip came out of the lifter and the part that contacts
&gt; the pushrod was bound up at a very tight angle.
&gt; 
&gt; The engine quit almost immediately when this happened.
&gt; 
&gt; The lifter bore looks OK, feels OK.
&gt; 
&gt; If there was any damage I did it by driving the car 8 blocks home at High
&gt; Rpm.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm going to check the camshaft lift with a dial gauge against another
&gt; intale lobe lift and if it checks out I'm going back together after I
&gt; bust the glaze on #3 and install new rings, and of course drop in a new
&gt; $58.00 lifter and new pushrod.
