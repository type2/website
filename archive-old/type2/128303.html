Subject: EGR Operating time recorder - when was it introduced?

Hi everyone,

I have a question about the &quot;EGR-operating time
recorder&quot;. It is a small unit under the dash of late
bays for the US/Canadian market. As far as I know it
works together with the EGR light on the dashboard.
But the microfiche says the &quot;operatingtime recorder&quot;
was introduced one year before the EGR light. May be
people with a 1975 model baywindow can help me with my
question?

I am talking about object 16B on this drawing:

The fiche says it was introduced with the start of
modelyear 1975 (august 1974). But somewhere else I
read the EGR light was introduced in 1976.

Could this be an error? Or did the &quot;operatingtime
recorder&quot; work with a buzzer in 1975 or something?

I there anyone who knows more? I am especially
interested to hear from people with a 1975 bay!

yours,


Vincent
