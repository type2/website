Subject: [T2] I forgot who I was talking to a couple days ago...

Hey - 
I was talking to someone from the list about the VW gathering who gave me an 
email address of someone from Assateague.  Well, my computer froze so I didnt 
get a chance to write it down.  Plus - I forgot your IM name (sorry about 
that!).  Can you email me with the address again?  Thanks a lot. 

Tracy
