Subject: 1972 Westy and 1973 Westy for sale in Pennsylvania

I have a '72 Westy and a '73 Westy that unfortunately I have to sell,
and rather quickly.  The '73 ran this time last year.  I believe all it
needs is a battery; I have one (I believe is good, it holds a charge)
and I will include it with the sale.   It also needs brakes, which will
be included in the sale as well (shoes and pads only), as well as a
brand new (uninstalled) 3 window pop top canvas.  It has a brand new
engine compartment seal ($30.00 value) and a tune up with literally no
miles on it!  I don't have that much information on the '72. I bought it
a couple months ago as another project.  I do know it sat for a couple
of years.  From what I understand it ran well and then the clutch cable
snapped and the PO parked it at that point.  I would like to sell them
both as a package deal if possible, but I am open to anything.  I also
have a 68-73 pop top and luggage rack for sale, as well as a few other
used parts.  Make me a reasonable offer and take it all with you!!!
Please pmail me with any questions.
