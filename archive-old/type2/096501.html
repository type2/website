Subject: Re: [T2] Nikki needs HELP!, Again...

Art,

I wonder if the &quot;binding&quot; she is refering to is the normal
dist cam edges moving the points?

We all know how bad some of the points rubbing blocks are holding up 
lately.

Does she have spare points?  Can she put them in?

Supposed to be one of the spares you carry in your emergency kit!

Cheers ,dave

&gt; Hi Listees;
&gt;    Art Lynch here in Texas attempting (yet) another long distance rescue
&gt; of Nikki Elko.
&gt; 
&gt;    She's currently on the side of the road, IH 10, west of El Paso,
&gt; Texas, somewhat inside New Mexico (she has no real concept of distance,
&gt; but she has not passed the Border Patrol checkpoint yet, if you know the
&gt; area that kinda narrows it down.)
&gt; 
&gt;    She was experiencing probable distributor problems, backfiring and
&gt; stumbling, and pulled the dizzy to check out the points. The dwell,
&gt; which had been holding steady all the way from HCBF, was suddenly &quot;all
&gt; over the place&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt;    She says the dizzy is &quot;binding&quot; at several points around its
&gt; rotation.
&gt; 
&gt;    I told her I think the dizzy is dying.
&gt; 
&gt;    She does not have a spare.
&gt; 
&gt;  I gave her the names of a few of the El Paso AIRS folks that were not
&gt; on her printout (printed April '02) so maybe they can help, though they
&gt; are all upright engine guys, not a type4 among them. Nearest AIRS guy
&gt; with a type4 engine is in Las Cruces NM.
&gt; 
&gt;    Anyhow, anybody in that area who can help?
&gt; 
&gt;    Any ideas, patches etc. greatly appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks;
&gt; Art Lynch
