Subject: Installed my first windshield.!!! 10 Minutes (must read)

I had posted questions close to a month ago regarding
windshield installation.. There were several replys,
and a lot of different ideas.. needless to say thanx
to all who replied..

I got ahold of an original German Folks member who now
works at a paint store near my house, weve been
talking VW's for a couple years now (shop talk),
anyhow he's done 100's of glass installs, so i call
his bluff and invite him over to help install the
glass in my bus (before we get some crazy flash flood
thing going on the inside of my bus).. 

before he arrives i install the rubber around the
glass(a little armorall to help guide works nicely)..

I wrap 1/8&quot; nylon rope around the first (inside)
groove, leaving the rope dangle about 4&quot; at the
bottom, I wrapped it twice around with both ends
remaining at bottom..

he gets to my house, grabs the windshield, places the
bottom groove in first i go inside and as he applys
presure to the (rubber only) i pull the string with
his push. We had to take a smooth like bottle opener
to help the outside bottom rubber pull out and over
the groove, but once the bottom was in place the rest
was a breeze..

People say, apply pressure to the glass, hog wash
apply pressure to the rubber, this thing was a breeze.
I was so worried about breaking it, while my buddy was
handling this thing like an animal..but hes gained my
confidence..

peace,
rob
