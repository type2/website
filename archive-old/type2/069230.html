Subject: Hi Joel, change the stats please, anyone need a rear seat?

Hi all,
        And hi Joel.  Well, till I get all the stuff with the
insurance company settled, I have two buses now, I've added a 72 bus
to the back yard.  Any one need the rear seat for a 9 pasenger bus?  I
got one that needs a home. 

take care,
        brandy
