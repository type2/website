&gt; I have a real question directly involving this part.  What does it do?
&gt; I mean, it's part of the flapper valve, right?  So, what's a flapper valve?
&gt; My old 78 had two of these deals hooked to the motor mount, and I just
&gt; thought they were silly.  They were never hooked to anything, but I assume
&gt; that's because they were hooked with cheap foil hose or something.
&gt; I just want to know because one day someone's going to come to me with a
&gt; question about those funny exhaust pipes on their bus, and I won't know
&gt; what to tell them.
&gt;
&gt; thanks,

Dave:
I owned a low mileage 78 Champagne edition from 1982 'til I cut it up in 99. It
had those flappers intact when I got it. The flapper valves are hooked with
cables to the heat lever on  the dash and direct the heat either to the main
heating duct via a Y near the front of the transaxle or they dump the hot air
under the bus. The 78-79 arrangement used these extra exhaust pipes and
aluminum corrugated ducts to hook to slightly different flapper valves and get
the air completely out from under the bus. I believe the 78-79 arrangement was
designed to lower the under bus temperatures, probably  to keep the fuel pump
and lines cooler and prevent vapor lock. Its purpose MAY have been  to lower
cabin temperatures in the back seat area. Another related feature was an
insulation mat, laminated of fiberglass and foil and covering the underfloor
area under the fuel tank (above the transaxle). I'm sure it was a good idea,
and the last emulation of the T2.
