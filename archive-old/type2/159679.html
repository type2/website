&gt; Actually WCM is in Harbor City (they moved from Torrance in 1992).

&gt; Both WWest and WCM are USA made quality EPDM repros ($25.70 for WCM, $29 
&gt; for WWest).  I've used both and the OE as well with no problems.

Any thoughts about oeveedub?  My friend just told me about them and said

And it's oem german, reasonably priced, too..

Thanks,

&gt; I have some OE VW Mexico seals for $24 each.

I will keep that in mind.. thanks!
