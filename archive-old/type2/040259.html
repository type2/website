Subject: Other engines for       Vee Dubya!

I was at a coming out party for the new Beetle last year at Burt Smith Volks 
here in St. Petersburg, and among the many VW's present for the show was a 
beetle with a 6 cylinder Chrysler engine shoehorned into the engine 
compartment. Hood closed, it looked absolutely stock. Hood opened, it looked 
dangerous and beautiful.  [ I like that in cars and women he said, happily 
married for 28 years,  driving a vw-bus...] 
However the owner had just dropped it off, and wasn't around to tell me by 
whom and how it was done. I have asked after that car at other shows, and 
folks have said, &quot;Oh, yeah, I've seen that car, but I don't know her name 
either...&quot; Still searching.
Anyway, it can be done. all it takes is money.
