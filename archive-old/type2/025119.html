Hi Loafers

I just started on this list and, I have to say, the mail reads like
poetry to a fellow loafer. I guess if you drive an old bus, its kinda
like a mail filter. All the flamers and disser's have been weeded out.
Only ones left are the people who (try to) understand man and machine.

I want to know if there is a roundup and review of aftermarket
electronic ignitions, CDIs for VWz. I have a stock dizzy (dual vacuum)
in my 72 bus and a 009 in my 69 Ghia. Are there any websites that give
comparisons, gripes, tips, dos/don'ts and such stuff?

Fweem on
