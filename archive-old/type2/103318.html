  Interesting....  So that being a 1600cc engine, does that mean in the 25 
years they made the vw bus, they only put bus engines in them for 7 or 8 
years?     Heavy!
 &gt;&gt;

Not really a &quot;bus&quot; engine, either.._dot_developed for the 411/412 up-scale
line and also used in the 914 Porsche/VW...(Remember the flak about
whether the 914 was a real Porsche from the Porsche clubs...?)
