Subject: Re: [T2]CAT

ok just had me worried... is all.
i was on a long trip and that was the first time i had ever seen that come on..? 
it barely glowed... i remember when i got the bus the egr light was on forever until a list member mentioned the little black box and the button to be pushed.
so that was taken care of...
the cat light worried me also cause i blew a exhaust gasket on the way back and was running kinda hot when coming through atlanta which has got to be the devils playground with all that concrete and heat and traffic good ness gracious...
thanks
peace
chris

&gt; CAT what is this light for ? what would cause it to slightly glow but not completely light up?

it's a catalitic vonverter light. I'm only going from memory, but I
believe the light comes on at a certain mileage. then is reset by a
button on a black box located behind the drivers kick panel. It might
be lighting up, but has a bad connection to the bulb?
