Subject: Status update on the Weber

Many thanks for the helpful advice on that nasty Weber. Things have 
mildly improved. For good measure, the fuel filter has been replaced and 
it seems as thought gas is getting to the carburetor somehow, so that's 
well enough. We (the number of people working on the Bus has grown) 
still stand around scratching our (very cold) heads at the thing, 
because it's starting and even running for a bit, but when the 
accelerator gets pushed or unpushed suddenly, she just stalls out.

So, we're thinking vacuum leak now.

Another friendly mechanic (my father) pointed out to me something that 
he had done while screwing with the wiring on the right tail light. He 
removed a large canister thing that was hooked onto a hose line dubbing 
it a remnant of the old fuel injection system and hardly necessary. Now, 
none of these symptoms began to occur until that thingy was removed. But 
I honestly don't know what the heck it is or does. So, I think I'm going 
to put it back on. Now, is that the possible source of a vacuum leak?

There are other things took. Issues of timing. I've never really known 
where to set the timing on the vehicle, I believe that it's 7 deg. BTDC 
currently, but I have no documentation to go by on this. And if anyone 
knows how a Weber converted Bus should be set up, then can they tell me 
where that hose coming from the port on the intake manifold goes (or at 
least is supposed to go) and why?

I appreciate the help. Not being able to identify things on my engine 
makes me a little nervous.

Bj
