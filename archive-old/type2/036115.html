 We paid a total of about $150 for the tool including buying the extra leg. I
 have no idea if we paid too much and I don't really want to know at this
 point. We probably did. Seemed extravagant and excessive at the time, but it
 made such a difference in getting the rear drum off that it definitely seems
 worth it now. This tool will last forever too.

My father taught me to spend the money to buy tools  and to buy good tools 
because with the proper tools you can do anything and do it easily.  Without 
the puller you couldn't get the drum off at least without a lot of pain, 
agony and time.  You didn't get ripped off if you had it when you needed it.  
I have fought the battle before so I am going to look into getting one for 
myself.
