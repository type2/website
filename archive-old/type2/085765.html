Subject: RE: Torsion arm install

Mike: For me this was the trickiest part of the install, and I had to start 
over several times. Here's what I did. (I had two helpers, but you can do it 
with one. I wouldn't want to try it alone.):

1) With both upper torsion arms off (yup ... sorry!) make sure the leaves in 
the torsion bar are squared and centered. If they're not, you won't get the 
arm to seat on them. Put some grease on there while you're at it.

2) Now put both arms on the torsion bar and have a helper hold one torsion 
arm on the bar while you install the other one (on the other side). If you 
don't have a helper just let the other torsion arm sit on the bar ... it 
helps keep the leaves from spreading while you bang the other side. Here I 
had someone lever the arm up with a bar while I banged it on the torsion bar 
with a hammer and block of wood. Stop when you have it up on the stop.

3) Now go to the other side and make sure the torsion arm is seated right on 
the bar. Hopefully it will be ... if not you may have to start again. Here's 
where the helper can save you time by holding it tight on the bar. Once 
you're sure it's seated, lever and bang until it's on the stop. While you're 
doing this, send a helper over to the other side to make sure the first arm 
isn't coming off while you bang the other side. The tension from the stop 
should hold it there, though.

4) Go back and bang the other side some more. Switch sides. Lather, rinse, 
repeat. It's on when it seats against the rubber seal.

I hope this helps. Like I said, I had to do this a few times before I got it 
right. At first I was having the same problem you are. It was because the 
torsion leaves were spreading -- they must be lined up perfectly for the arm 
to go the last few inches onto the bar.

At least you have the chance to practice your profanity!
