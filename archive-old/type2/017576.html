&gt; Does a '71 bus with a 1600 engine have any towing capacity?  Stop
&gt; laughing!  I was thinking about a little, teeny trailer that would be
&gt; used on trips to get some of the lighter, more bulky stuff like sleeping
&gt; bags, clothing and blankest out of the bus so the kids have more room to
&gt; stretch out on trips--instead of being wedged in like cargo!

&gt; Thanks, Lauria Watts

Lauria:
Seems to me I've seen ONE-WHEELED trailers that have virtually no tongue
weight that were really designed for bugs and buses: Allstate maybe?
Does anyone know about these. 
I've actually got a chassis for one with a wheel, no box or brackets for
towing vehicle though.
