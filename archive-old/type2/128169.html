Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust Nuts

Yup, 8.8, 8mm-1.25 TPI, zink coated. The brass one are
better but the one's I used are just fine, just use
new ones every time you can. Some people use the
locknuts, I find they have a tendency to break the
exhaust stud, making a simple job hard.. Lowes/Home
Depot have them for about $.90 for six, the nut place
has a 100 for $2.00 and you can use them all over the
engine. Phil
