Subject: Re: Fuel Filler Necks are Back!

&gt; Go westy has them for a little cheaper.

But go westy's are for leaded fuel nozzles. Here in California you cannot
pass the Smog Check visual if you don't have a fillpipe restricter for
unleaded nozzles. Yes, I know that all you can buy is unleaded but I guess
the state of California doesn't.....
I pmailed Bus Depot asking if they were leaded or unleaded, but I haven't
gotten a reply back.
