&gt; Well, after replacing my mechanical fuel pump once, then cleaning out the 
&gt; tank best i could without removing it, checking fuel lines, and replaceing 
&gt; the push rod, I have determined that my new mechanical fuel pump has broken 
&gt; on me, so instead of buying a new one I am saying to hell with the entire 
&gt; mechanical fuel pump world and going to buy an eletric one, what type should 
&gt; I buy, how do I set them up, do I need some special pressure regulator, why 

OK, I will use the Rocky Mountain Motor Works numbers etc. (Bus Depot uses
same numbers

1.   remove old fuel pump
2.   block off old pump mount, use RMMW part VC14 001 ($9.95)
3.   use electric fuel pump conversion kit RMMW part 938-439 ($52.50)
  and follow the instructions

finished, should take maybe 2 hours

(fuel pump will not work with Fuel Injection, but yours doesn't have Fuel
Injection because they already have a special electric pump)

the block off plate will not work on 72-79 buses you will have to make one
for them

&gt; why did I buy this bus in the first place?

because you didn't like your hair and wanted to rip it all out???

no really when you have it working right it feels so good.
