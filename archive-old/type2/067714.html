Subject: Parts Plea for 75 Deluxe

Hey all, I am looking (without any luck) for a few parts that I really need
before winter here.  I don't expect them to come bite me in the butt, but I
have really found nothing but jack squat where I've looked.  RMMW doesn't
carry them, and maybe I am just unaware of the proper places to look.  I
tried a query on the net as well, and came up with no leads.  Could someone
give me a pointer or two?  This newbie appreciates it.

Here are the parts I need:  The vent cover and city water inlet cover that
sit behind the driver's side door.  

Also, what is WCM?  I think I have seen people talk about that on this list,
is it a parts place?  

thanks for any help..
dave
