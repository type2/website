Subject: electricity question

For all you real and virtural campers out there.

I have the 120V outlet in my 77 bus.  I am preaty sure that this is hooked
up to the second battery.  My question is how much use do you all get out
of that outlet?  I assume that since the battery is 12V you are sucking
watts 10 times faster than a 12V appliance.  I am most interested in
laptops-computers that is, not pets. 

One more thing, what sort of lighting set ups to people have.  I have a
feeling that I am getting into something big here...  I have the little
floresent on the drivers side, but I would like to get a good bright
light(12V?) to read with on those early winter nights.  

Thanks a bunch.
