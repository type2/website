&gt; The PO of my 72 Adventure Camper was a serious Deadhead, and the bus is
&gt; covered in all kinds of stickers.  Unfortunately, several of them are
&gt; stuck directly on the paint of the rear hatch and engine compartment
&gt; lid.  Anyone got any recommendations on how to remove these stickers
&gt; without damaging the paint?  I was hoping there is some kind of magic
&gt; solvent that will take the stickers off, but leave the paint unharmed.
&gt; The PO also &quot;played for the other team&quot; so to speak, so I really would
&gt; like to get these rainbow stickers off my camper.

Try a hair dryer set on high, heat the sticker and as it starts to curl
up and/or wrinkle and soften, scrape off gently with a single edge razor
blade (obtainable at a paint store).

On glass you can try soaking a piece of paper towel in acetone and
soaking and scraping the sticker off as mentioned above.

Good luck!
