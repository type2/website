&gt; What I am asking is this. Was this a bad mechanical

Aftermarket sets and Bosch sets are completely different by design:  
measuring them will give very different results.

&gt; Should I order the right set? (why?)

Replace it with Bosch 09171 next time you need new wires.

&gt; The bus seems to be running good but you often
&gt; can't detect variances. Just want to be sure

What are the resistances of each lead from coil to spark plug?
