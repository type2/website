&gt;Tear-down revealed #3 intake seat and port hammered out of head.  Most other
&gt;valves were leaking. Head is un-rebuildable garbage.

&gt;Stupidity/ignorance of said &quot;DM&quot; caused mine.

Ignorance is lack of knowledge. Stupidity is the lack of the use of
knowledge that we have. What we learn when we fail is one method that
doesn't work. 

When an apprentice in Edison's shop despaired of ever
finding a substance that would work for a filiment in the progress
on the development of the light bulb, and said he was afraid someone
else would find the solution before them, Thomas Alva told him not to
worry as they already knew of near a thousand substances that did
not work, therefore they were WAY ahead of everybody else.
