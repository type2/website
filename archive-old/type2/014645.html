Subject: Magnetic front window screens
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

I am asking for feedback from the list on the following idea:

I've read several posts from list members concerning making their own front 
window screens, or purchasing them from for $35 + shipping etc.  I too made 
my own screens for my 71 Westy about a year ago, and they have survived a 
full camping season, and I am very pleased with them.  I am willing to make 
sets for any list member who is interested.  But before I offer this, I 
wanted to make sure I did not step on any toes, or violate any kind of list 
policy. 

 I would be willing to sell them for much less than the above mentioned 
price, and would be personally handmaking each set from high quality 
materials.  They attach to the bus magnetically, so no holes or velcro strips 
are needed.  You can use your windows, and open your doors without any 
interruption.  I have only made them for my bus (loaf) so I would need to 
make a template for Vanagon's and Splitties to accommodate everyone in the 
future.  

At work, my philosophy is usually, do it first, ask later, but this is about 
something entirely different.  Because of the help and generosity of list 
members, I'll be camping for four days in Cape May NJ, in my 71 Westy, which 
just two years ago had been given up for dead by its P.O.  I would like to 
give something back to the list, and maybe put a dent in the bill for the new 
front calipers and rotors I'll be needing soon.

I would appreciate any and all feedback concerning this idea, good, bad, or 
indifferent.  I will be leaving for NJ on Wednesday, August 16, around noon, 
and will be returning on Sunday, August 20, in the evening.  I currently get 
the digest version of the list, so you can either post, or e-mail me directly 
(I think this would be better since I'll be away until Sunday) at 
mrjrm12_at_aol_dot_com to leave feedback, and I'll get it all on  Sunday

Thanks All, 
Don Johnson
71 Westy &quot;Arthur VanDelay&quot;
