Subject: alternator
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL - S

hey folks,
  I have a 71 bus that has been converted from a
generator to an alternator.  My new battery was
completly drained every morning, even after being
charged the night before.  Figured out that there is a
short in the alternator.  I have a friend who is
knowedgable enough to rebuild it, but we are having
trouble finding parts.  It is a motorola with an
internal regulator.  Does anyone know where I can get
parts for this baby.  Thanks
   Nick Moran
