hello list,
I am in the middle of a rebuild and noticed that about a half quart of old 
black oil drained out of the heat exchangers that are standing up along the 
wall in my garage.  Lots of blow-by hey?  What should I do about cleaning 
them or shouldn't I worry about it?  I don't want to have to worry about it 
(got enough to worry about with the engine and tranny being shot).

Thanks,
Adam
