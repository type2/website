&gt; 
&gt; 	Dave Brodbeck describes his formerly FI engine equipped with 
&gt; dual Weber 34 ICTs backfiring through the carbs above 2K rpm. Gee, 
&gt; that sounds like a spark problem to me. Too much static or dynamic 
&gt; advance producing a spark when the intake valve is still open? 
&gt;  
&gt; 	What if you disconnect and plug the vacuum lines?

--&gt;  I've tried that; also checked (and re-checked) the dwell, timing, and
spark plug gapping.

&gt; 
&gt; 	I've had 'backfires' from bad sparks allowing combustable
&gt; mixture into a hot exhaust where it goes off. I thought it was a carb
&gt; problem too. Not so.

--&gt;  Yes, I'm familiar with that...these are definately backfires out the
carbs, though.  (With the air cleaners off, I can see the puff of smoke
and vapor come up the carb throat.)
