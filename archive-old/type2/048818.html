Subject: [T2] Heat exchancer needed in Washington State.

Hello all, I wrote a while back, but I'm gonna try again.  I am looking for 
the piece of the heat exchanger that bolts to the head, like an exhaust 
manifold.  I don't need the whole heat exchanger, just the foot or so long 
piece that bolts to the head and combines the exhaust from #3 and #4 into 
one.  Mine is cracked, and I am having trouble finding one.  It has a thin 
heat-shield over it which I do not care about the condition of (or if the 
heat shield is there at all).  I have a 77 westy with a 2.0L.  It needs to 
be from the drivers (#3, #4) side, as the flange to bolt it to the rest of 
the heat exchanger is different.

I will pay for it of course, and if your not in the area for shipping.  
Basically I am desperate.

Does anybody know a VW junkyard in washington state?

Thanks,

Marcus
