Subject: RE: [T2] bleeding brakes by oneself

Sounds like it should work.  The bleed hose may have a tendency to jump out
of the container due to the squirt pressure when you hit the brake, so you
may want to immobilize it somehow.  Otherwise you make a mess like I did.
You can also buy one-man bleeder hoses with a check valve at auto-parts
stores for a few bucks; but your plan will probably work just as well.

Subject: [T2] bleeding brakes by oneself



I need to replace my right front brake hose. I live in the country, alone,
and am hoping to do this today.
Re bleeding: If I run a small hose from the bleeder to a container w clean
fluid in it, keeping the open end of the hose below the fluid level in the
container, should I be able to pump air out w/o sucking it back in?
I know to keep the res topped off.
Thanks
Best wishes
