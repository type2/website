&gt; And at the end of the day, I still do not believe in rigging my bus

CHT gauges provide peace of mind for some especially those that blew  
an engine sometime in the past when they might have averted  
catastrophic failure in favor of a head swap. In my opinion, it's a  
worthwhile addition because most reconditioned parts aren't as good  
as the originals.

There's little arguing that VW left the owner somewhat blind when  
virtually every water cooled vehicle came with a water temperature  
gauge. No doubt that when the radiator overheated, the visual sight  
of steam probably was noticed before the gauge, but at least the  
gauge confirmed the problem.

With our buses and their rear-mounted engines, we are driving blind  
until we notice smoke in the rear view mirror or are forced to pull  
over from a sudden loss of power.
