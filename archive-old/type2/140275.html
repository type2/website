Subject: Re: [T2] Speaking of Bruck of Germany 

This is made in Malaysia with German tooling.



http://www2.cip1_dot_com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=C24%2D043%2D903%2D109%2DGER


Is this made in Germany or China? It is Bruck.

The ad should not try to create a false impression of where it is made.
People do notice that and are not stupid.

BTW, the quality is good. People do want the straight goods about where
these are made.

I got this response from those that know.
