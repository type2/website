Must not be any pilots on the list, heck, I've flown behind many a VW
before, they make a pretty good aircraft and hovercraft engine.

&gt; Dear group:
&gt; 
&gt; I have some rather dumb questions.   Before reading further realize
&gt; that I have the Bentley book and the Muir on order, but I am new to
&gt; the VW aor-cooled world since owning a Beetly in 1972.
&gt; 
&gt; This Spring I picked up a 78 Westy from a friend.   I've always
&gt; wanted one and well, this was the time.
&gt; 
&gt; Reading all of your posts has been very handy in helping me make
&gt; restoration and repair decisions on the Bus.
&gt; 
&gt; In the dash is a place to the right of the Speedometer that is a
&gt; blank round punch-out.   I *know* i've seen a triple gauge unit there
&gt; in someone's Bus.   It was Temp, Oil Pressure and one other just like
&gt; in my old Mercedes of the same era.
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone shed light on these gauge pods and where to get them?  Are
&gt; they aftermarket or out of high-end buses?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt; 
&gt; BEN
&gt; 78 Westy (not yet named)
&gt;
