Subject: Re: Ceramic Coating Exhaust

I've had really good experience with ceramic coating. But.. it really has to be done right, and it really depends on who you have do it for you. I had one friend ceramic coat his exhaust manifolds and Y-pipe in a Pontiac Fiero. Within a week's time, his engine bay was covered in what looked like shiny metal flake (it was EVERYWHERE!!!). 

But in my own experiences, I have a ceramic header in my Pontiac Solstice.... it was done VERY well... it grealy reduced the underhood temperatures. I beat that car silly every day to work.. and the ceramic coating has held up. 

I also have ceramic coated inside and out ported exhuast manifolds and Y-pipe on my 87 Fiero 5-Speed, and they've held up for about 4 years now (with LOTS of abuse).

I think it really has to do with preperation and the proper formula. There is a guy in Fort Lauderdale that only charges like $180 bucks for a set of V8 manifolds... and the quality is SUPERIOR to anything I've seen.
