Subject: Re: [T2] Air Conditioning for your bus - NO HP hog 

HEY,

I have used Peltier devices in my other hobby, astronomy.  They work very 
well.  We use them to cool CCD chips (usually around -40 C) in cameras or to keep 
large telescope mirrors within 1 degree of the ambient temp.

I can not see them being used for cooling the Bus's cabin. I have been 
thinking may be the icebox.  They keep it very icy.
