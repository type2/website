Subject: battery tray

Hello all,

I have searched the archive &amp; library but still could use some more specific 
help re: replacing my battery tray.

The tray is rusted 60% so my wife bought a replacement from Bus Depot for 
Christmas and it looks to fit pretty well (over the existing tray - maybe 
better with some pounding).

My struggle is this:  Wife is iffy on the bus, we just spent $$$ to get it 
painted (it had to look pretty if we were to buy it), and I have to replace 
this darn tray soon or I'm going to drop my battery on the 110.  How can I 
replace the tray without screwing up the paint? 

Any creative welders out there?

Thanks,

Eric
