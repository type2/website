Subject: Good bye to the list!

Howdy all,
Just a quick note to all of you out in type 2 land. I have been a quiet member of 
type 2_dot_com for many years, and have enjoyed reading all the great information, and 
occasionally responding when I could.
Things at home are getting busier all the time, and I just don't find the time to read 
the e-mails nowaday's, so the time has come for me to sign off.
For those of you that know me, I can still be contacted on this e-mail address.

The good news is my bus ('77 Deluxe micro bus) is still going strong, and is truely 
part of our family, and in true &quot;kombi&quot; fasion is evolving yet again, as it has done 
over the years to meet the needs of our growing family.

Anyway, a big thaks to all of you that have helped me over the years, and 
hopefully I will be back again soon!

Richard,
Brisbane Australia
(the man with 4 kombi's, one beetle, 4 type 3's, soon to have a type 4, and a yard 
full of parts....)
