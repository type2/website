Both of our busses are station wagons


&gt; Any torsion bar will fit any baywindow bus, AFAIK.  They are all the

&gt; arms were changed through the years.

&gt; Don't count on it.  If the bus is set too high your CV boots and joints

Welllll, I guess the bus isn't sagging *that* much.  I shall save the
boots and joints. 

&gt; You have to take the bars out and measure the diameter with a
&gt; micrometer or vernier calipers.  There's no other way to be sure.

Hubby doesn't have either, though he's been asking for one or the other
for a while now. . .maybe Christmas?  Besides, it's moot if we're not
swapping for heavier bars.

&gt; I'd think that just about any VW mechanic would know his way around the
&gt; rear suspension, but it's a job that, while not difficult, consumes a
&gt; lot of hours.  It'll cost you quite a bit to get it done.

Some one told us that it can be hard to get the bars swapped/adjusted
due to the danger of the swap/adjustment. . .

&gt; 
&gt; OTOH, it can be done in one Saturday with time allowed for
&gt; head-scratching.  What do you have more of, time or money?

Thanks, George!
