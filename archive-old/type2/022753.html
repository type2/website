X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

the red &quot;B&quot; light on your dash is a brake warning light.  it usually means one of the circuits of your dual-circuit master cylinder is failing.  check your entire brake system IMMEDIATELY.  if the brakes are functioning properly it might possibly be a wiring problem.  i would not suggest driving this vehicle until you get it checked out.

good luck &amp; keep on truckin'

That little round &quot;B&quot; light on my dash is acting up. Though I am not sure if
it's just a short or if there's something really wrong with my bus.  Regardless,
I would really like to know what the heck this light is for... please? Anyone?

thanks,
