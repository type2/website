Subject: Paint info needed

Hi Volks,
   Our 71 westy is presently in shades of primer gray and green (bought it 
that way) and I want to get some paint on it.  The local autobody supply 
shop quoted me a price of about $100/gallon for a middle of the road quality 
  acrylic enamel with hardener.  He also told me to expect $50/gallon for 
primer.
    While in a hardware store I picked up a gallon of Benjamin Moore Paint I 
thought I might be able to use instead.  It's an Alkyd, Rapid Dry Gloss 
Enamel that when used with their Gloss and Hardness Enhancer is recommended 
for use on construction, hiway and mining equipment.  It is sold as part of 
their Industrial Coatings line of paint.
   I tried it(without the hardener) on a piece of scrap sheetmetal and found 
that it is easy to spray, dries to a nice shine, and you can rub your hand 
across it in about an hour.  The down side is that even after a week it is 
not as hard as I would want it to be.  Think I'll get the hardener and try 
again.
   At $25/gallon (plus hardener) it seems like a possible alternative for an 
inexpensive, do it yourself, paint job.  There are about 16 standard colors, 
and they can mix any color you want.  They also have compatible primer to go 
with it.
   So my question is, for those of you who know paint, do you think this 
would be suitable for an inexpensive, do it your self, paint job?  Our bus 
will never be a show car, but we would like it to look nicer than it does.
   More info on this paint can be found at 
http://www.benjaminmoore_dot_com/im/im-alkyd.html   The paint is #CM20 and the 
hardener is #M76.
   Thanks in advance for your help.  Everyone enjoy the summer before we 
have to start scraping the inside of our windshields again..lol
