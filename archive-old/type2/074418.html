Dear List,
Sorry to have to revisit this topic, but I spent a good hour yesterday =
removing the kick panels, windshield washer reservoir and lots of other =
PO add-ons to get to the front inside sheet metal of my bus, to try to =
see where the spare tire mount bolted to the inside. Due to the metal =
heater channels and other welded metal parts, I could not even visualize =
the studs, nor stick my hand up there, to feel around.
Can anyone help with this? I want to remove the spare tire mount and =
replace to stock with the original emblem. One list member suggested =
that I cut off the studs from the front and push them through. That is a =
possiblity, if they are not removable from the back.
Thanks in advance.
