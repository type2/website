Subject: Re: [T2] Storage/Prep Oil Question

&gt;From: Chris Put several gallons of oil into the engine so the internals are 
&gt;totally submerged. Of course you'll have to drain it but...


It is a short block with most orifaces open. It will only be in storage for 
about a week. I just want to really lube it up to the places it counts the 
most. I am waiting for parts to arrive.

Thanks,

Michael Knight
