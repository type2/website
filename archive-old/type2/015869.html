&gt;The Bently FI manual [How to understand, service and modify Bosch Fuel

says:-
&gt;ideal or stoichiometric air-fuel ratio for combustion is 14.7:1 by mass.
&gt;Max power is at 12.6:1 and max economy at 15.4:1
&gt;
&gt;ie max power is at a rich mixture and max economy is at a lean mixture.

Okay, you got me.  :)

&gt;The charts also show that richening beyond 12.6:1 will result in loss of 
&gt;power.

Agreed.

&gt;Those of us with Cats and Lamda sensors will be held in the region of 14.5:1 
&gt;and 14.7:1 for max emmissions control and a good compromise between 
&gt;drivability and ecconomy.

Don't bet on it.  The lambda sensor is very crude and basically only tells
you which side of 14.7 you are on.  Your engine uses this to constantly
adjust the mixture one way or the other.  I've seen many, many cars hooked
up to the wideband O2 sensor at the chassis dyno and the mixture goes all
over the map - anywhere from 10 to 17 to 1.  By the way, the wideband O2
sensor that the dyno has costs several hundred dollars and is much more
accurate than the O2 sensors that are in your vehicles.  It tells the real
story.  It's readout is more like:

1     --
     /
    /
0 --

versus the one in your car which is more like:

1    --
    |
    |
0 --


&gt;A fuel-air mixture out of that boundary will damage 
&gt;the Catalytic convertor!

It will?  The cats in my Mustang lasted 10 years with me fiddling with an
adjustable fuel pressure regulator, changed compression ratios, head
porting, etc.  I run in the neighborhood of 13.5 to 1 right now at WOT and
according to the dyno, it doesn't make any more power when I bump up the
fuel pressure to run richer.  I know what the book says, but that's not
what I have seen, or the difference was too slight to notice.  I'm sure if
you ran way way rich or lean eventually you would get unburnt gasoline to
the cats which would overheat and melt them, but you certainly don't have
to stay right near 14.7.  

&gt;In the section on modifications increasing the pressure is one of the ways 
&gt;suggested to increase power; 

I would venture to say that it would only increase power if you also
increased the breathing ability of your engine to take advantage of the
extra fuel, but I'll admit I've never tried it on a bus.
