&gt; I posted this a couple of days ago but didn't really hear back.  I am
&gt; thinking of changing my stock 78 exhaust system to a 72-74 style.  I
&gt; want to hear from someone who has actually done this to hear how it
&gt; worked out, if all the sheet metal works and the heat channels line up
&gt; and connect.

thought I posted, I did it to my 78 and it worked great except I did not
hook up the heat, in fact don't have heat exchangers because I use the gas
heater for all heat.
