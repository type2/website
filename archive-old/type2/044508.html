Subject: [T2] F/S Complete exhaust for 81 Vanagon

I've got a complet exhaust system for an 81 Vanagon for sale it includes the
heat exchangers cross tube Cat Covtr, and new Muffler and a &quot;Test pipe&quot; that
goes where the Cat. is.
The Heat exchangers are in good shape has some surface rust on one the other
is clean.
Used but no holes. or extender rust.
The Muffler is new. The crossover pipe is in good shape.
I want $350 and the buyer pays shipping.
I'm in the Detroit area so figure from there.  Thanks
Joe Davis
