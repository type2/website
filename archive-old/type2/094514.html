Subject: Re: [T2] Further info Re: [T2] 72 Westy trouble...

She stated she could restart the engine.

The problem is that from what she was describing it could be the engine 
was just cutting out which could lead to bad indications on the dash.
  I would first start the engine and verify i had oil pressure.
then the basics after looking for  loose connections in the engine bay.
if you have a meter verify alternator output.

1.  fuel filter
2.  ignition coil, points, condenser, plugs
if plugs are severely fouled, comp check the cylinders.  If just 
severely worn because nobody has replaced them since the engine was put 
in, replace them and still continue wit the rest of this list
3.  fuel pump(if you can verify pressure)  If not start engine and 
verify that you get a steady running and no pulsating noises, or 
extremely noisy.
4.  air cleaner
these are all items that can be bad and still get a started engine but 
no run under load.

&gt; Thanks for your reply. I will have to look at the wiring when I get
&gt; home. I was going 60 mph on
&gt; a flat road, although I had come over the big bridge about 7 miles
&gt; before the oil light started blinking and the speedometer just started 
&gt; dropping off to 40 mph. Made
&gt; it to Aransas Pass and had it towed home. The motor was replaced in 
&gt; '88. I have the work orders
&gt; for everything that has been done to it.
&gt; Since I haven't had it long, and don't know anything about it, it's hard
&gt; to know if the engine
&gt; sounds any different. Seems like a clicking that might not have been
&gt; there before, but not sure.
&gt; Thanks again for everything!. I fell in love with it, and was getting
&gt; ready to jazz it up. Hope we
&gt; can save it. Kathy
&gt;
&gt; (Art here...
&gt; I've asked Kathy to get the engine number and whether it is carb or FI
&gt; and other details this evening when she gets home. Meanwhile, any ideas,
&gt; scientific wild-ass guesses?)
