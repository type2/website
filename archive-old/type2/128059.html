Subject: Re: [T2] Anybody Have These?

i agree this has worked in the past for me until a list member sent me the piece i was looking for...
poke a small hole in it and then use tin screws to hold into place.. and yes cut with tin snips..
peace

Why not simply get a piece of tin/flashing and simply cut it
with snips to fit? It's not very big. Works in a pinch and as
good too. It's easy to screw through or simply drill a couple
holes in the right place.

&gt; I need the two lower cooling tins that go between the heater boxes and the
&gt; case for a '73 1700.
&gt; If anyone has these please let me know. I can't find anyone who has them.
&gt; Unfortunately there are no Pick-A-Part type places around me that have any
