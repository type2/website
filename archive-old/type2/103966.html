Subject: RE: [T2] remanufactured half axles reliability??

&gt; &gt; Any body have experience with auto zone or other
&gt; &gt; remanufactured half axles????? Do they last? TIA!
&gt;
&gt; Considering that the life of CV joints is usually over 100K miles
&gt; (sometimes _way_ over), there is probably not enough data out there
&gt;
&gt; I'm a bit suspicious of the idea of &quot;remanufacturing&quot; CV joints.  Sounds
&gt; to me like they are taking old axles, keeping the OK CVs, and making up
&gt; the deficit with new CVs.  Could be a good deal, could be a Failure in
1000
&gt; miles.


If you don't want to chance it, I have brands new axles with CV's and boots
already installed, for $114 each.  Manual trans only; my part # 211 501 203.
Also have them for Vanagons.
