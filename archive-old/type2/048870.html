&gt; Thanks for the reply.  All the parts suppliers say they are the same.
Nikki
&gt; found some fiche to confirm that they are different and she is looking to
see
&gt; if she can find the proper one so i can finally get this together, its
been
&gt; quite the epic.

Here are the correct part numbers:

left pipe, 72-74 + 79 = 071 256 051
right pipe as above = 071 256 052

left pipe, 75-78 = 021 256 051C
right pipe &quot;   &quot;    = 021 256 052C
