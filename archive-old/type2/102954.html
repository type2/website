&gt; Where is the first thing I should look at if my engine suddenly starts

&gt; gears fine but when idling the engine races as if it were in second or
&gt; third gear.  (I am guessing as a don't have a tachometer.)  I just had a
&gt; new clutch installed, if that means anything.  Thanks for mulling this

Test the decel valve.
