Subject: Driving with a bad valve

I'm looking at an '80 that has (what I was told) a bad valve (valve 
seat). If I was to buy it it would be a 40 mile drive home.
If I was to ground the spark plug wire to the bad cylinder (it's 
already running on 3 with the bad valve)... I was thinking that 
without the cylinder firing the valve wouldn't be stressed and it 
ought to make.
Any thoughts?
