Subject: Re: [T2] dizzy rebuild was vac dizzy help....

You would just buy another vacuum can if you have verified that is the
fault. As mentioned by another post, you would remove the can arm and
see if the base plate will move to be sure it is not just a sticking
base plate with a good vacuum can.

 Back up and running with my 009 and have the vac dizzy on the kitchen table.
 What causes the vacuum thingy to fail and can it be rebuilt? Any tricks to
 bringing it back to life? Is there a diapram invloved?
