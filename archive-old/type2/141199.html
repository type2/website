Rear Axle Hub difference?

&gt;&gt; Are the rear axle housings the same from 68 to 79?  I know the axles, bearing and seal are different.
 
&gt; HUH? Hhat?  I am dead flat certain that the housings, axles, bearings, and
 seals are the same from '73-'79 and that the bearings, axles, and seals
 are the same at least thru '83 (altho the V'gon housing is quite
 different) and had always &quot;known&quot;  that this was true from '68-79.  If it
 isn't, PLEASE someone post!
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Housing:
Left:
211 501 253  start of 68 model year to 210 2300 000 [end of 70]
211 501 253B   211 2000 001 to 211 2300 000 [71 only]
211 501 253C   from 212 2000 001
BUT ETKA says:
211 501 253E   from 211 2000 001 til the end of 79

For the Right side, all the numbers are the same except 253 becomes 254.

Not sure what VW did to make the E replace the B and C......

Hub:
211 501 619  from 211 2000 001 [71 model year went to composite drum and hub]

Stub axle:
68-70
211 501 265
71-79 AND 80-91 Vanagon
211 501 265C

Outer bearing:
68 to end of 70   
211 501 283
71 up
211 501 283B
BUT ETKA says:
71 up 
211 501 283D see workshop manual H-100 2/1973
The 211 501 283D also fits 80-92 Vanagon

Inner bearing:
211 501 287 
All bays and 80-92 Vanagon

Outer and outer seal:
211 501 317   both are the same
All bays and 80-92 Vanagon
