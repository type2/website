Subject: Re: [T2] Hello everyone...This is long, but please bare with the newbie.

Hi Claud,

&gt; 69, but the chassis # and the door handles say it's a '68.  &quot;Cool,&quot; I
&gt; thought...&quot;first year of the breadloaf westy......hey...wait a minute...the
&gt; Westfalia plate on the bed is stamped 1969...and it has no pop-top.&quot;  Does
&gt; this mean it's not a real westy?

If the third number in the chassis number of your bus is an &quot;8&quot;, then
the bus is a model 1968. For example: 238 ... ...

The stamp on the Westfalia-interior tells you something about the date
the interior was made. I suspect it was swapped or was fitted on an old
microbus or delivery van. Send me the codes on the M-plate in your bus
and I'll tell you what it looked like originally.

Westfalia-campers were indeed made without pop-up as well! I parted out
one like that two years ago, it was a 1969 imported from the USA into
the Netherlands. It had Mcode 517 but not Mcode 518 which stands for
&quot;pop-top&quot;.

&gt; the college.  Money saved and knowledge gained.  The flack?  Mom and Dad say,
&gt; &quot;Don't put any money into that thing...you'll never get it back!&quot;  If I do
&gt; all the work, it only needs about $1500...$2000 tops (and I think that's a
&gt; stretch).  Add to this what I paid for it, and the total is $2800.  Will I
&gt; have trouble getting that back?  To tell the truth, I don't plan on ever
&gt; selling it, I just want to appease the 'rents.

The thing is that it is a hobby and hobbies cost money. When I invest
money into my bus I don't think &quot;will I ever get the money back?&quot;
instead I think &quot;fine, this will last for another decade or so&quot;. Because
I don't plan to sell them either.

There is one other thing you can look into: &quot;can I get a much better bus
for that money and buy it, instead of restoring this one.&quot; After all,
you are imnvesting a lot of money and time in this bus while you might
get a bus for the same amount of money that has much less rust than this
bus, which also saves you time. But, restoring a bus is never a bad
thing to do I think...
...right now I am thinking of that one very good bus I should have
bought instead of the doubtfull three buses I have now.
