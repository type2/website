Subject: Re: [T2] To clamp or not to clamp. That is the question...

I have never clamped those and have never had a loose
one. They have always been a real bear to break loose
when I needed to remove them. That said, you could, if
you're concerned, put them on with a light coat of
Gascacinch or weatherstrip adhesive (gorilla snot! -
generic name - NOT a Gorilla Glue product)so you can
be sure they're sealed but still nice and neat.

If I were to clamp them, I would use Oetiker clamps.
They are much more expensive but they look really neat
and clean, unlike wormscrew-type hose clamps.

I don't see how it could hurt to clamp them, as there
should never be more than a few thousandths expansion
/ contraction differential and they should be flexible
enough to allow that even if clamped.

Personally, I would not. -BaH

 That is the intake sleeve on the Guac. Just a bit
 over a year old.
 I've been a big proponent of clamping. They don't
 leak or anything.
 But I'm going to pull off the intakes soon and
 figure I'll replace the
 sleeves while it's apart. And I was wondering if
 maybe it's not such a
 good idea...
