Subject: alternator bracket

Good day all,
1977 2.0 bus: Does any one know if there are different alternator brackets
for the different displacement type 4 bus engines?  I'm talking about the
bracket on which the alternator tension nut bolts to, the bracket attaches
above the alternator to the engine case with a single nut and the bottom
appears to attach to the exhaust system (can't remember where the original
attached to...doh!).  When I rebuilt my engine I switched from the stock
triangle flange exhaust to an earlier model exhaust with the trapezoidal
flanges and straight back discharge (I was given a good set of heat boxes by
one buddy, and also a good German muffler which only required minimal
unbending :)  The stock bracket doesn't fit now, it appears to sit too far
forward to connect to the trapezoidal muffler flange and the heat riser tube
gets in the way now.  Is there another bracket available?  It would appear
that it will have to &quot;dog-leg&quot; at the bottom, or will I have to fabricate
one?  I have had a jury rigged bracket in since the overhaul but the flimsy
alternator pivot point bracket isn't supporting the alternator correctly and
I'm getting pulley alignment problems, which I have to address before I
break something :)

Cheers,
Drew
