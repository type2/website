Subject: Re: [T2] 75 westy table

oh... well it doesnt really matter to me I just get stuff that will 
work and not to concerned with exactly the same repo... to me if it 
fits it works, never mind color (unless its really an ugly color 
and/or doesnt match).

&gt;[...]
&gt;
&gt;Gowesty is wrong! That table they picture is for 76 to 69, NOT 74/75.
&gt;
&gt;74/75 mounts to the wall, is wood grain, has a swing out leg, and the leaf
&gt;slides out. [almost the same as 68 to 73, but they were white or white w/faint
&gt;black lines and no leaf]
&gt;
&gt;
