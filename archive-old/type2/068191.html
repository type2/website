&gt;         Right. I'm not arguing legality or ethics here, I'm stating

&gt; many cars are indeed sold every day in CA *without* smog, and the buyer is
&gt; the party responsible for smogging it. This is agreed upon and understood
&gt; prior to the sale. I suppose in theory someone could be a dick, but in
&gt; reality the guy getting the good deal is usually happy with just that. I
&gt; was quite happy when I got my bus for $150 from the impound yard, and they
&gt; didn't give me a smog. I never even *considered* legal action.

If the vehicle from the junk yard was non-operational, it was likely sold
that way (as a certified &quot;non-operational&quot; vehicle). Thus the seller is
not respponsible for smog. My discussion tended toward the driveable cars.
Those sold where the buyer is buying a supposedly &quot;driveable&quot; vehicle
 ... and in California that means smogable.

 The 16 year
&gt; old kid-or the 40ish geezer-getting the new bus will likely be happy to
&gt; make the score, and deal with smog themselves. People who want a one piece
&gt; package generally buy a new Chrysler, not an old bus.

My sentiments are the smnae as yours with regard to the typical &quot;attitude&quot;
of a person who would buy a VW. We are very likely NOT to be stiffed. But
in this day and age (where someone can spill coffe on themselves, through
their own carelessness, and make millions in a lawsuit against the
supposedly &quot;at fault&quot; fast food joint), I am very leary of the public at
large. Who wants to have to deal with that one-in-a-million person who
decides to take you to the cleaners. Then there is the practical issue: I
can repair my VW myself for about $700 in parts to get it smogged (and I
really had to shop around to find parts and then get a good price when 
able). If I sold it, and the buyer couldn't get it smogged he could easily
have tallied up a $2K bill if he took it to a shop. 

&gt;         As for ethics, check some old threads about new car manufacture
&gt; pollution vs. old car usage and you'll find how I feel about BS smog laws.

I agree with you 110% on this one. It has got to be better in
terms of mimimal pollution, energy  and water useage, etc. for me to
keep one vehicle on the road for 20-30 years, than for me to buy a new car
every 4-5 years. Go figure!

Cheers, Chris
