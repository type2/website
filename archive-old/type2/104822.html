Subject: Re: [T2] Got my second bus tonight

&gt;I wonder if i can actually call it a bus without getting the list mad at 
&gt;me?

Of course you can call it a bus!!!!And your other one wont' get jealous, 
they love company....the more the merrier, if i had enough money and space i 
would have a fleet of Volkswagens.

Sounds like a cool bus, have fun with her.
