&gt; That will make you run lean since there is no fuel going in with the air

Hey, I'll bet that's why I had to put bigger main jets in back when I
first installed the carbs, about five years ago. I knew getting online
was going to be worth it. I wish I had had this list to help me out back
then. I also was sucking bunches of air around the throttle shafts. I
just got that fixed with bushings in the last month. I'll bet when I get
the T out of the line (which I *am* going to do), the original jets will
be just right, again.

Thanks for the tip David.
