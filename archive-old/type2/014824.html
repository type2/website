I have used this tool for over 10 years now and it works good. I do not
remember ever using it on a Bus, but it does not work well on a Bug. I have
used these things on everything from little Jap cars to Motor Homes. It has
the strength to handle it. Also handy for other odd jobs.

&gt;okay, so VW had a tool so you could replace ball joints without using
&gt;a press. does anybody have a part# for it. I can't find one in the Hazet
catalog.

I have no idea if this will work on a Bus but I was surfing and noticed it.
 The
bus join it a hare bigger than most american style FWD joints though so...
