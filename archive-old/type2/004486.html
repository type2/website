Hi renoir here. 71 West.
Hey if you can figure this one out let me know. It has been driving me crazy
for a long time now. Mine pulls to the right. I have replace the right
caliper and disk, along with the
front hoses.
Just switched the calipers to the other side, no change.
I am wondering if it is alignment?
How can you check alignment yourself?
Only recently is there tire where on the left inside tire.  And that is
because i have to
hang on to the steering wheel hard to the left to keep the bus straight.

When i go on long downhills and apply the brakes frequently, disk and pads
smoke.

Again alignment?
