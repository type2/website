Subject: Counter Monkeys and Rain

I called a local VW FLAPS for two parts: The front shifter bushing and the
stop plate. When I told the guy it was for a 78 Bus he said, &quot;Oh, we don't
have anything like that for a bus. We're mostly bugs here.&quot; I didn't even
bother to explain the stop plate is the same for bugs and busses since he
couldn't be bothered to look it up. And, yes, this is the useless place that
sold me the wrong gasket set for my 73 and swore up and down it was correct.
Sigh.

Why is it that whenever I'm working on the bus for a long trip it rains? The
day I was prepping the GWB to drive from CA to CO it rained. The day I
prepped the Guac to do CO to CA to CO it rained. And today I get to do it in
the rain AGAIN for another CO to CA to CO trip.

I swear Mother Nature likes messing with my head. ;)

BTW: I picked up a killer deal today: A vareity pack of wire grommets at
Checker for $2.49. Lots of different sizes. Also, Checker (Kragen, etc)
carries the screw on &quot;Lock-It&quot; or whatever they're called wire connectors,
terminals, taps, etc. About the same price as WallyWorld too. For those of
you allergic to the Wally. =)
