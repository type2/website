Subject: Re: [T2] electrical gremlins - just about to leave on a trip...

which bulbs??? it sounds like 12v is getting accross lines somewhere or 
a ground is now floating.  Take the sockets that you changed the bulbs 
in out of the housings so no contact is being made to anything and 
remove the bulbs.  Then check for the problem. I dont mean to cut 
anything here just pull them clear where you can see the back sides of 
the connectors and check for corroded out wiring.

&gt; Hello all;
&gt;
&gt; Sorry for those on both lists - I had to post this both places for 
&gt; maximum
&gt; coverage...I need ideas fast...
&gt; I finally thought my '71 Westy was ready to go for early tomorrow 
&gt; morning
&gt; on
&gt; a 3 week trip...fired it up to go for our goodbye dinner, and the brake
&gt; warning light was on...shite...
&gt; When I hit the brakes, warning light went off... ??? When the headlights
&gt; are
&gt; off, brake warning light is also off. When the headlights are on, with 
&gt; the
&gt; brake warning light, the right turn signals and the brake lights don't
&gt; work.
&gt; When the headlights are off, things are ok.
&gt; Additionally, and this is a good one, when I have the headlights on and
&gt; this
&gt; problem is happening, and shut off the ignition, the engine keeps 
&gt; running
&gt; until I take my foot OFF the brakes...then it shuts down...
&gt; I know this is abstract and obscure. Please help if you have any 
&gt; ideas. I
&gt; needed to leave early tomorrow morning. I have not fooled with the
&gt; electrical system other than replacing some bulbs that didn't work. 
&gt; Checked
&gt; timing and dwell recently, but didn't unplug anything. Checked gas 
&gt; heater
&gt; fuse because it wasn't igniting. Fuse seemed fine.
&gt; Cheers all
