Subject: Re: [T2] Air cooled junkyard

i haven't been able to find them for quite a while. 
ibelieve they all moved to costa rica or somewhere
like that down in/near south america.   i think the
town shut down there shop finally, so when they left
someone else was maintaining the website, but it looks
like they let it go.  it was an entertaining site.
