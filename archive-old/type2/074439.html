Subject: Re: [T2] Engine-neering - combustion chamber question


&gt;
&gt;  a fibre glass rap to go around exhaust pipes to help keep the air coming 
&gt; into the engine cooler (cooler air is more dense so gives more power)


The problem with the wraps is that so much heat gets soaked into the pipes 
that they disintegrate in a very short time.

The wraps have been around for a long, long time.
