Bob Hoover, the airshow pilot, has returned to the airshow circuit again.
He was the center of a storm of controvery when the FAA pulled his license
after an airshow.  They thought he didn't perform as well as they expected
and decided he was old and senile.  It took alot (maybe Melvin Belli?)
for him to get back to flying.  It took a couple of years as well.

I wish I could fly as well as he does!  He flys a Shrike, by the way, a
twin-engine Commander.  He's one of very few twins that EVER fly airshows.

I don't know for certain, but I can't imagine the two Bob Hoover's are related.
