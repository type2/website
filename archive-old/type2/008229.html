Subject: Timing Problem...I think

Hi Volks!
Lately I been having this problem when I step on the gas pedal a lot.
If I step on it too much my bus kind of jumps and this kind of loud pop 
noise comes out of the tailpipe.I wouldn't say it backfires,because that 
would be a lot louder.I've gotten used to it and know how much I can 
step on it without making it pop,but my dad is used to driving his '57 
F*rd w/a 351ci,so he always floors it in my bus and gets insane road 
rage when it pops.Anyways,he's my mechanic and seems to think the timing 
needs to be adjusted.Any suggestions?Thanks in advance!
