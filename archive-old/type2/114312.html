&gt;Hiya folks,
&gt;
&gt;   Yesterday was a good day.  I went over to a friends house and we took
&gt;out the gauges to see why the fuel gauge quit.  After fixing a wire that
&gt;might have been grounding it out, we finally came to the conclusion that
&gt;the problem is in the tank unit.  Bluck.  But on the bright side, I'm
&gt;having the engine removed within the next two weeks anyhow, so fixing it
&gt;then will work out okay.

Some years ago I changed the tank unit on my -78 bay by cutting a hole in
the sheet metal above the tank. As far as I rememeber the hole had to be 
about 4&quot; by 4&quot;.
First I had to meassure the position of the hole by cutting a larger hole 
in a wrecked car
in a scrap yard. The hole of course had to be sealed off with sheet metal 
afterwards,
but I did not have to take out engine and tank.
