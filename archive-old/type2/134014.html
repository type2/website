&gt;Michael Heron on the BugPack list just pointed out an interesting
fact....

&gt;&gt; FYI to all you thankful bus drivers- the man who came up with the idea
&gt;&gt; to build busses would have turned 100 years old today.

a slaute to ben. i put in a tranny in a 75 bus. no bunnies to report., but
i did do it in my slippers. best d'oh: tranny strap connected on the
heave-ho out. german trans in bend supplied the gears and recommended
MT-90... my maiden synthetic.
