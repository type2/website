Hey y'all
I thing I've got a bad sending unit.  When the bus is still not fully warmed 
up and I take a fairl sharp right hand bend in a 'spirited manner', my oil 
pressure gauge and light come on.  Of course I shut down immediately and go 
out back to check.  Plenty of oil in the sump, sending unit wires are there. 
  I'm running a dual output sending unit (light and gauge).  Any thoughts?

Mad Uncle Dave
