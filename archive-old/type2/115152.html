&gt;Jack,
&gt;The system only opens the injecters for a set period of time. The volume of 
&gt;fuel that flows through the
&gt;injecter is controlled by pressure.
&gt;The reason the regulator is contolled by manifold vacuum and Bentley gives 
&gt;a spec for it:  Think of a
&gt;carburetor with an accelerator pump. When you step on the throttle, you get 
&gt;a shot of fuel. Same thing happens
&gt;with EFI. When you step on the throttle: manifold vacuum drops, fuel 
&gt;pressure rises, more fuel flows through
&gt;the injecters. You get a rich condition.


Actually the opposite is true. The injectors pulse on time varies  as a 
function of throttle advance. The differential pressure at the  injector tip 
is fixed at the regulator value measured with the vacuum line removed from 
the regulator. The details can be found in  &quot;Bosch Fuel Injection &amp; Engine 
Management&quot;  by Charles O. Probst,SAE.
