Subject: Re: [T2] 1978 Shift Rod R&amp;Rquestion

&gt;#2 How do I get the shifter rods out? Out the front or... &lt;gulp&gt; out the
&gt; &gt; rear (meaning I've got to pull the engine and tranny????) Say it isn't 
&gt; so!!!!
&gt;
&gt;it ain't so
&gt;
&gt;but i just said that 'cause you wanted me to.

Thanks Scott! I felt better for about 1/100th of a second. &lt;grin&gt;

&gt;the replacement rear bushings are pathetic quality, impossible to install
&gt;without doing quite a bit of work to them. they are very poorly molded and
&gt;don't fit on the rod. the front bushing i would buy from the dealer, the
&gt;rubber quality is completely different between the dealer ones and the
&gt;aftermarket.

Anybody ever turn any of these from store bought PVC pipe? Anything close 
in diameter?

Nearest dealer is 2 hours away (Chattanooga) and he's a &amp;^^**(_at_#^. 
Nashville and Knoxville I have no experience with.

Maybe I can live with the shifter noise and poor shift quality... &lt;grin&gt;
