Subject: Re: [T2] exhaust questions.

Not sure what you mean. If you are talking about where the boxes bolt to the
head, then your info is wrong. 76 to 78 2.0L have oval exhaust ports just like
72 to 1.7 and 1.8.
79 has square ports like 80-83 Vanagon.
72 1700 heater boxes will bolt on to any 78 factory 2.0L.



&gt; if your engine is a 78, then its a 2L, and the heat exchanger wont fit, the
&gt; flange are not the same.   If you have an engine from 1700-1800cc then it
&gt; will be okay
&gt;
&gt; From 76 to 83 they made 2 liter engine with different exhaust than 72-75,
&gt; the 2 liter flange are flat and before that they were embossed!
&gt;
&gt; Other option is to switch head from a 1700-1800cc but im not sure as many
&gt; thing are different like hydraulic lifeter ....
