Subject: Newbie here! Any Seattle area groups/clubs?

Hey hey, I finally got the VW bus I've been wanting for years. It's got
no carpeting, and only the FAR back seat, so I think it's a Kombi. I'm
told it's a 72, and it was used for a parts car for a while, so it's
missing several pieces. Distro. Starter, Gas Pedal, etc, etc. and the
body is gonna take LOADS of work. But I'm game for it. :) What I'm
wanting to know is if theirs any Tukwila (south seattle) area VW clubs
or anything that I could join to get some support for my rebuild. Both
information on what stuff needs done and troubleshooting and stuff, as
well as finding out where to get CHEAP parts and stuff. Also are their
any Seattle area like ALL VW swapmeets or anything? 

It's my first REALLY old car (I say REALLY old becouse I turned 30 this
year, and it's older than ME! Now that's old! :) ), and I'm not totally
clueless, but kinda close. :) I've done most of a frame up resto on a
Ford pickup, and I've gotten pretty good at body work. It's the engine
that's got me worried. I'm good enough to replace broken parts, but I
don't really know VW's good enough to even tell what half the parts ARE
let alone where they should go. :) 


Well, thanks in advance for any reply
Chris and his wonder dog Ubu. :)
