&gt;Funny how we cringe at the thought of yahoos lowering their busses 
&gt;or chopping new holes in the roof, but we seem to advocate the 
&gt;wholesale slaughter of irreplaceable Westfalia cabinetry.

AMEN to that one, Blake!  

Once cut, you can't go back.  Do yourself (and any potential future owner of
your Westy) a favor and carefully remove the original cabinet and build a
replacement that will bolt in.  It won't take you much longer than
butchering the original anyway.  That way if you get sick of it or it
doesn't turn out the way you envision or you want to sell your bus, you've
got the original ready to go right back in.

Save the Westies!!
