&gt; The build up of crud behind the pedal should be vacuumed periodically,

The gas pedal is your basic strap hinge so look for crud build up
at the knuckle and pin...where the pedal meets the floor...;-)
And yes, I've gotten a bus home with a real strap hinge, duct
tape and some foam rubber for a return spring...
