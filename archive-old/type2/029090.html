Hi Volks!

My 72 Riviera, Russ, has some heating issues.  I've got replacement cables
but the old ones are being a pain.  The metal tube they're supposed to run
down was modified by the PO.  The metal tube was cut about three feet from
the heater boxes and the cable runs outside of it until it comes to that
cut.  At that point the cable was run through the last 3 feet and connected
to the barrel connecters, etc.  Well, the PO at some point decided to pull
out the 1700 and couldn't find the time to release those barrel connectors
and so just cut the heater wires.  I tried to pull out the remainder of
those wires from out of the guide tubes and ended up with a mess of
uncoiling wire protector tubing instead of a nicely pulled out cutoff heater
cable.  Are you lost yet?  So.  Does anyone have any suggestions about how I
can remove the remaining trapped heater wire and mangled shealth out of the
guide tubes?  I pulled the plastic caps off the end by the heater boxes, but
there is nothing to grab onto at that end.  On the forward end, where the
cut in the Guide tubes is, I have about4 inches of uncoiling shealth and no
cable.  I've pulled, cussed and prayed, pulling most of it out but now it's
getting really hard.  I was hoping for some advice before the uncoiling
sheath snaps and I'm up Paddle Creek without Sh*t. : )

On another tack, would someone be willing to post a little something about
who Bob Hoover was or is on Friday?  I see his name come up often and with
revernce, but he never posts himself.  Has he gone on to the Great Gig in
the Sky?  He seems like someone I regret not having had the chance to meet.
