hello once again list,

once again this is a '77 w/ 2L FI hyd.lifters

i finally got around to hooking up a fuel pressure tester to my fuel ring
today. it reads a little under 30psi at idle, about 35 psi at higher
throttle, so i assume to pressure regulator is ok. when i turned off the
ign. however, the fuel pressure steadily dropped and was down to 0 in about
2 minutes. So i figure i've got a leaky fuel injector(s). i know it's not
the cold start valve b/c i hooked up one long fuel line from the left rail
to the right rail, bypassing the cold start valve, and disconnected the
wires (all 3) to associated equipment.

how can i figure out which one(s) are leaking?? do i have to bring them to
be tested somewhere?

so does anybody have any fuel injectors that don't leak for cheap?? the ones
at busdepot are ~ $55 a pop.

are there any junkyards with FI buses around Chapel Hill, NC (the
triangle)??

do i have any other options?

thanks again for all the helpful replies. this list is the best resource
EVER. period.

peace,
Marko G
