Subject: confessions....

I posted this week on a noise coming from the rear of the engine, 78 westy.
Well, tonight I found out why!  The flywheel bolts were coming out.  I knew I
needed to install an O ring on the flywheel.  The one I purchased I thought
was too big so I went off to the local ACE hardware (import places were closed
on Sunday)and purchased an O ring meeting my idea of what size they should be
and installed it.

Well that was stupid!!!  Flywheel bolts coming out......   Can any one fill me
in on the RIGHT way to install the O ring and the Right size  it should be and
RIGHT spot It should go?  I would be most grateful!

Some folks can read a book and get it right, other folks can read the posts on
type2 and get it right....ME naw I wanted more experience pulling the engine!

thanks!
