Subject: Decel Valve?
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Greetings,

My 78 2.0 idles fast after being warmed-up.  I suspect the decel valve.  I did
the
Bentley test and it failed.  Also, the Auxiliary Air Regulator kinda flunked.
I was able to blow air through it, but I had to blow Hard.

Anybody had trouble with the decel valve?  Sean, I don't see it listed at your
great site.  Do they not commonly give trouble?  I THINK my decel valve and
aux. air reg. 
have both gone south.  They both flunk the common tests.

Kind of hate to lay out major bucks to replace when my biggest problem is a
fast
idle (of course slow when cold due to the aux. air reg).
Any opinions, wise or otherwise will be welcomed.
