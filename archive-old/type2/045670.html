Subject: [T2] changing to metal fuel lines

Hi Volks,
   I want to replace the fuel lines in my 71 with metal.  I know some of you 
have used brake lines to do that.  I am wondering what diameter you have 
used as I can't find that info in the archives or library.  Also, if you 
were to do it again, what would you do differently?  You know, hints or tips 
to help me get it right the first time.
   Thanks in advance for the help
