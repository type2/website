Tim- I see what you are saying, and while I wouldn't agree that i do them a 
disservice, I will say that this issue is a hot button of mine.  
Unfortunately, I didn't have time to finish what I wanted to say because my 
wife came in and found me on the type2 list instead of doing some research 
for her. She wasn't too happy and so I just sent off the message unfinished. 
I agree that busses cannot handle too much strain ( I used to work at a VW 
shop and I saw my share of overheated and overstressed engines), but cruising 
at 70mph (impossible in the hills or mountains) IS something that the busses 
were designed to do- read the manual. But what really gets my blood pressure 
up is when people start saying that because the speed limit was 55 that 
busses were never designed to go above that!  What kind of logic is that? I 
think that misinformation like THAT is more of a disservice to ALL bus 
owners, new and old- spreading erronious conventional wisdom around.  
Basically I think that we need to be informed about all aspects of our bus 
and both sides of the opinions expressed on the list. I was just expressing 
mine and I just happened to have my manual handy to back me up. Drive how you 
like, but know that driving for 20 miles at 70mph is NOT going to kill your 
bus... as long as it's not on its last leg anyway. I put over 1000 miles on 
my bus this summer doing anywere from 35 mph to 70mph. It all depended on my 
driving conditions. You have to learn when to keep your foot off the floor 
and when it's ok to step on the gas. 
Enough ramblings.   I'm going for a drive.
