Subject: Re: [T2] Buses in Knoxville area??

&gt;AFAIK, it's slim pickings around here.  Whenever I go to Harriman in the next
&gt;county to the VW mechanic I trust Lurch with (when I am unable or don't care
&gt;to do the work myself) I will go out into his boneyard, which is small and
&gt;well picked over.  There is another junkyard near Seymour (Hendron Chapel
&gt;Road?) that I used to go to when I had a Ghia.  They had some buses, even a
&gt;barndoor (I think).  It's at that end of town - toward Gatlinburg - but still
&gt;quite a drive from there.
&gt;
&gt;I just got off the phone with a few junkyards (including Lowe's mentioned
&gt;above) and came up busless.  It doesn't look good.

There are supposed to be a junkyard or two in Tullahoma (I don't know first 
hand). I do know there is a pretty big stash of imports (even Porsche and 
Fiat) in Clarkrange, TN. The owner's are a bit nutty. Another handfull in 
Crossville but I don't know where, and finally a bunch (3 dozen?) near 
Cleveland, TN.
