Subject: engine is OUT!
Mime-Version: 1.0

ladies and gentlemen....

well, in the course of 3 hours, my better half and i managed to drop our 
first engine.  no real problems, i must say!

but in the process of the whole thing...i came up with some questions....

1) i have a westy.  the cables exist for a second battery on the driver's 
side.  how can i tell if the PO left all of the relay wiring alone?  the 
a/c compressor was removed sometime when the engine was originally 
replaced, so there are some &quot;extra goodies&quot; lying around the engine 
compartment.  what does the relay wiring look like?  the box with the 
battery monitor is still mounted on my closet on the interior and the 
cables are attached to the deep cycle battery.  i mainly bring it up, 
because in the process of disconnecting everything...i wondered how the 
batteries could be &quot;connected&quot; while being on opposite side of the 
engine/alternator.

2) my oil pressure sender is on the top left of the engine.  i bought a new 
gauge/sender(dual) and also purchased the extension hose kit.  where should 
i attach the sender to?  should it be back on the shield (vertical) by the 
firewall or should i mount it on top of the engine (flat) on the shield 
that covers that side of the engine?  which is the best position to allow 
it to work properly?

3)  i'm taking the engine to a machine shop tomorrow to have them remove 
the twisted out studs and replace them.  if they have to remove the heads 
in the process, i will have them check out the condition of the sleeves, 
etc.  does anyone see a problem in getting the outside of the engine 
steamed clean?  mice made the engine compartment a home for a year or so, 
and it really needs to be cleaned in order for it to cool properly.

this will hopefully be the last major step in this process before we hit 
the road in 3 weeks.  i gave my notice at my job on friday, so there's no 
turning back now!

thanks again volks!
