Subject: Jalousie Window R&amp;R Part 1. (L!)

Part One: Removal and Disassembly.

In pursuit of the completion of the infamous '67 West Resto from &quot;Heck&quot; the
VanBondo tribe decided to detail the dickens out of the five louvered glass
camper windows. Additional windows were acquired at various shows and
junkyards during the eternal wait for the completion of the body and paint
processes. Most of the time they can be had for cheap and are in sad
disrepair. Elbow grease and clock time can make these puppies really look
and work nice.

During the initial tear-down of the bus we carefully removed the delicate
painted metal trim pieces from around each of the windows. In the SO-42
interiors these trim frames were painted to resemble wood. Easily bent, they
were placed in a safe location until they would be put back into service.
Next we very carfully removed the screen from each window. Press on the he
top of each screen frame sliding it toward the roof of the bus. Select a
very thin tool, possibly a small standard blade screwdriver (if necessary!)
and slip it between the frame and the bottom of the screen frame and help it
out of it's track. BE CAREFUL as the screen material (if still intact) will
be real delicate and will rip very easily! The screen frames themselves have
a tendancy to fold and crease if given enough pressure. (Been there, etc.)
Take your time. Place the screens in a secure spot, maybe in a box, for later.
The window frame assemblies themselves were carefully extracted from the bus
via several screws located around the perimeter of each window on the inside
of the van. Have a helper on the exterior of the bus to prevent the frames
from accidentially falling to the ground and becoming damaged. Set them
aside, out of foot stepping range, as they are removed.

Once we had the frame assemblies removed from the vehicle, we had to make a
decisision as to whether to make them look stock or jazz them up a bit.
Inspired by a nice white SO-42 that we saw at both the '95 and '96 SOTO
Garden Grove show, we decieded to polish the frames to a high polish. The
bus that I refer to is owned by a very nice Hispanic gentlemam from the
SanDiego, CA area. Highly polished jalousie windows are not stock but they
kinda look similar to chrome and set off the generally utilitarian nature of
the beast when completed. The alternative might be to have the frames glass
beaded or attacked with 3M scuff pads. Stock, original camper windows of
this type have a understated satin appearence and look nice also. It's a
personal taste thing. The amout of detail that you put into these windows is
up to you and will determine whether they will have rattling glass, retain
the dreaded draftiness, and look sharp (either polished or OEM) or tattered,
dirty, and dull.

Starting with frames which had the typical thirty plus years of dinge on
them we dissasembled them down to the bare frames. Removal of the three main
slats of tempered glass should be accomplished via the back (top) side of
the three pairs of hinged aluminum holders. Carefully maneuver the glass
away from each pair of rotating aluminum holders. I have seen sets of window
frames ruined by attempts at glass removal by the front (or lower) end of
each pair of holders. The aluminum which makes up the rotating pairs of
holders can withstand only a certain amount bending. Radical tweaking of the
arms will result in ruined and worthless frames. Retracting the glass from
the frame involves a combination of rotating the crank handles to various
positions and a touch of experience with Japanese puzzles. Take your time
and look at the frame closely. You will eventually figure them out. Each
window frame has one singular stationary piece of glass postioned at the top
of the frame. This remaining piece is removed by undoing the single phillips
head screws, one on each side of the frame.
We chose to carefully remove the six highly weathered grey rubber retention
(rattle) stoppers on each frame. These rubber bumper pieces are located
between the glass and the frame at the end of each piece of movable glass.
If dried to the point at which you choose to remove them, try gentle prying
with a small standard blade screwdriver or small needle nosed plyers. The
key word to doing these windows is &quot;gently.&quot;
Next separate the two halves of the main frame assemblies by removing the
eighteen phillips head screws from the perimeter of each frame. Gently pry
the two halves apart and remove the dried putty type material that is stuck
on the pieces. Try a wood popcycle stick or fat edged ceramic tool to
prevent scratching the frames.
The last item to be removed is the crank assembly. I found that cranking the
window approximately half way open and removing the two phillips screws to
be the first part. The second part is to look in between the main frame and
the sliding piece that keeps the three slat holders in synch. Wiggle the
crank handle assembly until the round disk shape that is inserted into the
guide piece lifts free. Use your finger or the light touch of a screwdriver
to assist if necessary.

Some cultures beleive in prayer, meditation, or song to be an intrigal part
of any process. Not to get too &quot;groovy&quot; on you but you might inject your
style of focusing during this window R&amp;R. Somehow, a combination of my
Navajo (Din'eh) buddy and a book to be called the &quot;Zen and the Art of
Jalousie Window Maintence&quot; came to mind as I did mine. I eventually found
myself praying that the task would soon be completed. Concentration, a fair
amount of time, and pride of my workmanship eventually paid off. =)
Part Two will discuss detail and clean up of the frames, glass, and various
materials that we chose to incorporate into our windows.
