&gt; So, I take my bus in to get the oil plug fixed, and then when I get the
&gt; car back, it's running all funny.  So tonight I'm redoing all the fuel
&gt; lines, and I noticed that they crunched one of the metal fuel tubes;
&gt; nice, huh?!

spoke to... uh... we are not going to be able to work on your vehicle.... uh
... what he's telling me, we wont be able to able to get an engine for it
..we don't know where we can get an engine and if ...
uh ... we were to get into yours we don't know exactly what the other
company did.... uh.... and we just won't be able to work on it for you
.....uh... we don't have the proper ...uh.... engine for you ....uh.... if
you have any questions ....uh.... contact Michael, 407-644-2222 and you have
a nice day.&quot;

Imagine yourself receiving the preceeding phone message
from the local authorized VW Dealer after being billed $75
for a repair estimate.
An inspection was requested to locate an engine oil leak.
The billed receipt included the following quote -

&quot; Found oil leak &quot;.

The inspection was billed at $75/hr.and was completed in 1/2 hr.
Imagine a dealer mechanic looking at your engine for 1/2 hr.

No repair cost estimate was provided.

Additional repair diagnosis was requested for several other problems,
and Diane was told these would require individual inspections
and billed separately. Steering, brakes, etc., etc.

It will certainly be interesting to hear the dealer recommendation
for service of this repair.
