&gt;Subject: 2000cc Engine Mileage Poll !!How many miles on your rebuilt
&gt;   2000cc!!
&gt;
&gt;I am looking into having my 2.0 79 westy engine rebuilt I was curious to see
&gt;what everyone's mileage is like on there 2.0 rebuild and if they have had
&gt;any problems in the given mileage that it has at its current state or since
&gt;its been rebuilt I want this rebuild to be a soldier on trips. Also I would
&gt;like to know who you had the engine rebuilt by and if you would recommend
&gt;having me send my engine to them. Also what did the rebuild cost? I want to
&gt;make sure I get it done right the first time. I can't afford a gene berg so
&gt;don't even suggest it.
&gt;
   Casey,

   FWIW,I have around 196,000kms (nearly 120,000miles) on my last 2 litre
   rebuild and still going  strong...although it does use a little oil 
these days...
   fair enough really...

   This engine, when I got it in 1990 ago had broken compression rings and
   was pressurizing the crankcase resulting in oil being forced out anywhere
   it could.But hey,it was in a '76 Double Cab which I picked up for around the
   equivalent of about $1300US so I wasn't complaining...;-)

   When torn down,the bottom end turned out to be sound...in fact it had
   been balanced (nice bonus for me:) and heads were cleaned and inspected
   and seemed good....but the valves,guides &amp; seats were replaced anyway..
   New set of pistons &amp; cylinders and it all went back together again.

   In the last 12 years since then,I have had one valve guide and one valve 
seat
   come loose on seperate occasions...both in the first 3 or 4 years from
   memory and typical type 4 ailments.Neither resulted in any engine damage.
   Both problems were fixed all has been sweet since then...

   To this day (apart from my current carb problem) I would jump in this truck
   and drive it anywhere without hesitation...although I would make sure I had
   a bottle of oil with me...

   Rebuild it by someone you trust keeping it as stock as possible and enjoy
   many more years  of VW motoring...:)

   Cheers,
