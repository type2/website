Subject: dirty heads, gen light, carb hose

    #dirty head question# after running into a stuck oil pump i decided to 
pull all the cooling tin from my 1600 to check for nesting creatures.. while 
i found no creatures i noticed a huge build up of grime on top of my heads 
which would have been completely obstructing the flow of air between them.. 
i have only had this bus for a few months and taken it on short trips. i am 
sure it has been like this for a long time but it has been driven very 
little, ten miles at most on any given trip. is there a method for keeping 
the heads clean without having to pull the cooling tins? could this build up 
of grime, resulting in faulty cooling, cause my oil light to flicker at low 
rpm??? i would be inclined to think if my oil light was coming on due to 
overheating it would come on at high rpm as well (as a side not i did 
install a new oil sensor and clean my preasure relief valves)... perhaps i 
didn't need a new oil pump after all but i want the full flow filter anyway.
    #gen light question# my gen light comes on when driving with my head 
lights on.. it usually stays very dim but non the less it comes on, which 
bothers me.. my question is weather or not i should bother taking the gen 
apart to clean the armature and replace the brushes or would i be better off 
to have it rebuilt by someone who is more qualified than myself? streching 
$$$ is important to me but on the other hand time is money so i don't want 
to waste it just to have charging problems again.
    #carb hose question# ok this is going to make me look like an idiot but 
there is a hose which goes from the top of my oil filler tube to the carb..  
i assume this vents gasses produced by heated oil in the crank case to be 
burned along with the gas.?.?. my question is weather or not there should be 
some kind of filter or something spliced into the middle of this hose 
somewhere.. the reason i ask is i notice an oily build up in the top of my 
carb which just doesn't seem right to me.... a dune buggy guy told me you 
can just close off both ends of that hose and go about your business.. as a 
greeny i'm not sure that is the right thing to do
thanks so much
