Subject: RE: [T2] windshield needed
Cc: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Ron makes a good point but I would add that the best way to do it is 
buy your seal from Ron at Bus Depot.
In 1999 I paid Safelite $99 to install a new windshield. They wanted 
$60 for their seal. I bought mine from Bus Depot ( I think is was a 
WCM seal ) for less than $20.  Total price installed came in about 
$119. Check with your insurance co and see if windshield repairs are 
covered under you policy.  You can put it in  yourself if you feel 
brave. New ones seem to break less easily than old VW glass.

I had some problems with Safelite but eventually they got it right. 
Check the archives for the ugly details. Bottom line is if I need 
another windshield I would use Safelite again but I would go 20 miles 
down the road to a different Safelite shop than I used the first time.

Thanks
Chris
&gt;  &gt; Our son threw a golf ball in our bus and cracked the windshield.  So
&gt;&gt;  does anyone have a front window for a '78 within 200 miles of Atlantic
&gt;&gt;  City, NJ, or a cheep parts bus?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Call Safelite Auto Glass, a national franchise (www.safelite_dot_com I think).
&gt;About $100 installed for a new one, and if they break it it's their problem.
