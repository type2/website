When driving in Baja CA, I have seen truckers and others 
commonly signal a left turn indicator when the lead vehicle wants
to tell the following vehicle that it is safe to pass. Oncoming
vehicles will commonly flash their lights at you (high/low beam, or on/off)
to indicate, &quot;Pay attention! There is a hazard ahead!&quot;

Karl Franz (The People's Guide to Mexico) says these signals are 
understood throughout Mexico.

I'm not aware of any signal used there for, &quot;Don't pass! It's not safe!&quot;
It's very clear and convenient to know these signals when motoring
south of the border.

Anyone seen these signals in use in our country?
