Subject: Re: Another Nikki Elko and Steve Dolan sighting, in Socal

Steve headed out early this morning to visit his friend Meg in the San
Fernando Valley, then off to visit his friend Martha in Las Vegas. He
planned to go over the pass on the I-15 tonight to be nice to the engine.

He was here for a week, and we got a huge amount of work done, both on his
bus and my house. As usual, we planned about three times more stuff to do
than there was time in which to do it, and we didn't get a chance to do any
work on the Euro-Westy. My garage is looking lovely, however -- I started
organizing it and the kitten area while he worked on his bus.

He replaced a hub axle and bearing race that were giving him problems, and
we rewired my phone lines in the house and did a massive amount of weeding
in the jungle that will eventually be a garden. We hit the junkyards twice,
visited Don &amp; Amy, and fed the neighborhood girls on Saturday since Jack
Stafford was the only guy to show for BBQ -- which was okay, because we had
just that much food.

In between all that we did feral cat rescue, taking two kittens to their
new home and the second mother cat to be spayed. I've got one kitten in
captivity in the basement who is taming up nicely, and one loose under the
house who was seen with a mouse hanging out of its mouth the other day.

Saturday Lauren (9), Vivien (11), and myself washed Steve's bus and cleaned
out the cab (mainly emptying the ashtray and rounding up the empty soda
cans), so at least he'll have a fresh bus for the first part of the trip
home. The back was full of parts, tools, and a windshield he salvaged, so
we just left that alone.

The neighborhood girls think he's just swell, even when he gets into
&quot;professor mode.&quot; They thought the pop-top on the Westy was the coolest
thing.

I'm glad to get back to work tomorrow -- I need the rest. :-)

I believe Steve's next listee stop is Jerry Jess in Phoenix.
