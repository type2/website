Subject: Need a sink/stove?

     I'm passing this along to whoever might be interested.  I just got back
from a quick trip up the coast, and spent last night with a friend in Morro
Bay, CA.  We spent part of the day hitting thrift stores looking for any cool
old guitar/hi-fi stuff---didn't see much of that, but I DID find a late-model
Westy sink/stove cabinet sitting amongst a bunch of desks and refrigerators.
It's not in very good shape, but it's all there except the spare tire cover.
All the handles and knobs were there, plus the table mounting pieces.  Have no
idea if it works, or how cleanly it was removed.  (Before you ask, I
frantically scoured the rest of the store hoping to find the table, stool,
tent, etc.---no dice :-(.  There was a c.1970 black middle bus seat, tho).
ANYWAY, the place is called the Second Hand Store, 335 Quintana Rd., Morro
Bay, CA  (805) 772-9009, ask for Cynthia.  Asking price was $60, but I believe
they'll take less.  I live hundreds of miles away, so I can't help you.  If
someone out there absolutely has to have it, I could probably arrange for my
friend to pick it up and store it, but only as a last resort.  Go get it, you
be cookin' in no time.
