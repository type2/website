Subject: Re: [T2] Metric or NPT was VDO oil Pressuse adapter question

&gt;I have the unit in hand (VDO oil pressure adapter that is) and the thread
is
10X1 and the hose is 1\4 ID (6.3mm)....

&gt;BUT, it comes with an adapter to thread into the 'mysterious hole'...so I
believe the answer is.... the hole is NPT.

It really sounds like I could screw the sender into the case fine if it
were not for a clearance issue of the tin. In looking at the sender the
threads look tapered like NPT to me. I am going to try some pipe tomorrow
after work and see how it goes. I have NPT taps and dies and pipes so I
think an adapter. Plus I have never seen a sending unit of this type that
was not with tapered threads so I have to believe that the sender and the
case are NPT. If they are not tapered what keeps the stock unit from
working loose?
