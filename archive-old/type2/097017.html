Subject: Clutch Compatability Question

&gt;My engine is a GE 2 liter, and I guess the flywheel is a match to that. My
&gt;tranny is a 091, but my clutch and pressure plate are 215mm Sure sounds
like you have the wrong clutch and pressure plate.
&gt;Or maybe just the wrong clutch. I'm not sure the 215mm pressure plate will
bolt up to the 227mm flywheel. Anyone?

When I mated my 78 091 (5 ribs) trans up with my 1800 74 motor, I used the
74 flywheel and clutch (the one you probably have), but I changed the
transmission
bellhousing back to the 74 002 style so it would accept the 74 starter and
so the smaller flywheel/clutch would have the appropriate sized bellhousing
to sit inside.
For you it may be a matter of switching up to the 2 liter flywheel/clutch as
the bellhousing may be expecting a larger diameter.
