Adam,

Your dist. is definitely not correct, but its a common band-aid solution to 
not having the correct set up on a type 4.  Get your ignition as close to 
stock as you can, then if you haven't yet, work on carb jetting.

My 74 bus had a stock 1800 with dual weber 40's.  It also came with an .009 
dist.  I installed a rebuilt engine and brought it to a local VW shop with a 
good reputation for the engine's final carb setup and correct jetting.  

They didn't want a thing to do with it until they had a stock distributor to 
work with.  I said &quot;but the carbs don't have a port for a vacuum signal to 
the stock dist.&quot;  They said no problem, they can tap one of the carbs and 
install a port in the correct place.

I produced a stock, correct for the engine and model year, dual vacuum, dual 
advance distributor.  They tapped the left carb, hooked up the advance side 
of the vacuum can to it and everything ran fine after that.  I just saw an 
article in one of the recent VW mags that detailed the same procedure on a 
type 1 engine.  They were installing dual carbs and also wanted to run the 
better behaved and more fuel efficient dual advance dist. 

Its my understanding that the type 4 engine needs 8 to 10 degrees more total 
advance than the .009 is capable of.  The best you will probably get is an 
average somewhere in the middle of the type 4's required advance range that 
will either short you advance at full acceleration or at idle.  Sounds like 
your .009 could be hitting the end of its advance curve when the engine still 
needs the extra degrees that the stock dist. would normally give it?

You are kind of at the mercy of opinion for what specs to use with an .009 on 
a type IV.  If you set it for 7.5 degees before tdc at idle you probably 
won't get enough total advance for maximum performance etc.  If you set it 
for 38 degrees of total advance at 3500rpm you may have idle problems??

If you don't want to try and run the the stock dist., the sense I get is that 
next best option is to install the .050 centrifugal advance dist. on the type 
4 engine.  This dist. is better designed for engines of this rod length 
(including porsche 356/912).

As far as jetting goes, You have to determine your mixture situation with 
your current jets at highway speed and at idle speed in order to determine if 
you are running the correct idle and main jets. Rejetting IDF's can get 
pricey, as there are 4 idle jets and 4 main jets that need to be correct for 
your engine displacement, setup and altitude.

You also should dermine what your venturi size is.  Hopefully you are OK 
here, as they are very expensive.

Idle jets (idle speed to 3000 rpm or so):  let your bus idle, turn it off, 
remove spark plugs, check the color and quality of any deposits on them.  
They should all look the same.  If there are any distinct differences in 
appearance from one to the next, you may have another issue to deal with 
first before you rejet.  If they all appear the same, determine what their 
color is telling you about mixture using either the type2_dot_com library and 
archives or a good manual.

main jets (highway speeds above about 3000 to 3500 rpm):  get your bus up to 
highway speed, (above 3000 rpm is about where the main jets take over from 
the idle jets?) and maintain that speed for awhile.  For the MOST accurate 
assessment of your mixture and plug condition, shut off your engine at speed 
and coast to a stop where you once again remove the plugs to check them.  
Again, they should all look the same.  Assess color and any deposits, then 
determine whether the main jets are correct.

I know little about the correct air correction jets or how you size them.

It is a complex process.  I remember a post on the list estimating that to 
buy IDF's, get them installed AND properly jetted can cost over $1000 if you 
pay someone else to do it RIGHT.  One change of jets can cost you over $20 
alone.  

Without a dyno handy in your garage it may take a while. : )
