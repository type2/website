&gt;'79 FI 2.0L westy, bone stock.  Just got the fresh AVP rebuild running
&gt;after the oil cooler fiasco.  Can't get enough advance out of the
&gt;distributor.  When I rotate the distributor for advance, the vacuum advance
&gt;hits up against the cold start valve.  Apparently, the good folks at AVP
&gt;installed the distributor drive shaft in a different position than it
&gt;originally was.  

This is a problem. 

&gt;What are my options here?  Can the drive shaft be
&gt;repositioned a tooth?  
&gt;How hard is this to do in the car.  How do you get
&gt;the shaft out?  How do you keep from loosing the spacer washers in the
&gt;case?

If you lift the shaft out, which you might be able to do with a strong
magnet, the washer(s) will just be sitting there on a &quot;shelf&quot;.  One bump
and they will fall into the case.  I can't think of a good way to
reposition the drive shaft and not risk losing a washer. 

I would call AVP and see what they say about it, but first you might try
the following:  

Rotate your spark plug wires (at the distributor) 90 degrees in the
opposite direction that you need to turn the distributor.  This will
effectively give you 90 degrees more advance than you had before.  With
luck (i.e. if you have room) you can then back off the distributor body
somewhat less than 90 degrees to get the proper advance.  If it's not clear
what I mean by this, let me know and I'll try and explain it a different way.
