&gt; Fellow Busser's,
&gt; 
&gt;     After battling a chronic *gas leaking into the crankcase* problem, I've
&gt; decided to swap carbs from my '74 parts bus onto my '72.   When removing the
&gt; carbs from my '74, I found spacers between the carbs and intake manifolds
&gt; that are about 1/4 inch think.  My '72 has never had these, as far as I
&gt; know.  Anybody know why these are there and wether they should be moved with
&gt; the carbs or not?
&gt;     Question #2 - The carbs I took off the '72 were missing the fuel-cutoff
&gt; switches, but the carbs from the '74 has them.  Would having these in place
&gt; stop fuel from siphoning through the carb into the crankcase?  I'm thinking
&gt; maybe I can just put the switches in my already set-up, but leaking, carbs
&gt; and solve the problem?
Brad:
WHY are your carbs leaking?
1. Floats levels set wrong?
2. Floats defective?
3. Fuel pressure too high (you don't have an electric fuel pump do you?)
4. Bad float needle and seat assembly?
5. Debris lodged in needle and seat assembly?
6. Holes in carb bowls?
It can't hurt to  change in the electric idle cut-off valves from the
74, but it won't make your carbs quit leaking- What's in those holes
now? -Probably nonadjustable idle jets from an earlier Solex.
I think the 72 is supposed to have the spacers, too.
72 carbs differ from 73-74 carbs slightly in where the air cleaner
elbows fasten on. 72's have round o-ring and anarrow groove to fit it,
73-4 has a flatter rubber seal and a wide groove for it, I'd check the
air cleaner fit before I started the changeover.
