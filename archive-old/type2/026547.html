Subject: RE:  Not firing on 1 and 3, could use some help please

&gt;Among other things it seems it is not firing on 1 and 3.  Idle set
&gt;at 900, pull 2 or 4 spark plug wire and the idle drops to around 600.
&gt;Pull 1 and nothing.  Pull 3 and maybe a drop in 50RPMs.  So I let 
&gt;it sit overnight, and I do a valve adjustment the next day.  Nothing 
&gt;is really that far off.

I know you've been around buses for a while and I don't want to insult your
intelligence, but are you sure you've got the plug wires going 1-4-3-2
clockwise on the distributor and that your timing isn't off 180 degrees?
'Cause if it is, the engine will run just like you describe.

The other (ugly and less likely) thing to consider is that the #1 and #3
valves are both operated by the same lobe on the cam.  So if you've got a
severely worn cam lobe, it would affect opposing cylinders.
