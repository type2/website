&gt;Folks, my bus has started making an interesting noise which I would like to
....
&gt;One of my CV boots is split but I can't feel any play or wear in the CV.  Could
&gt;it be something to do with this anyway?



Yep.  Classic CV Joint symptom and cause (split boot, bad lubricant, worn joint)

Have fun
