I lived in my bus for over a year while going to school in Asheville, NC.
I loved it!  I had some high times, let me tell you.

As for logistics, well not too bad.  Nature was in the bushes.  I had
friends and the gym for showers.  I ate out a lot.  Got hassled by the cops
a few times.  Made some cool friends.

If I had it to do all over, I wouldn't change much.  Do keep all your tools
with you.  My toolbox made a nice stool.  Good luck to you.
