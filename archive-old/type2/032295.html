Subject: The End of my '75 Bus :(
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.SOL.4.20.0102051004520.19419-100000_at_csa.bu_dot_edu&gt;

my girlfriend called me the other day saying that her bus (my bus, on
extended loan) wouldn't start... she said it was just making a
&quot;humming&quot; noise when she turned the key. She also said right before she
parked it, the steering was acting weird. I figured they were 2 different
problems, but I was baffled (but not surprised) by both. This bus is a '75
Hardtop converted camper (1800FI). Upon inspection, the engine and starter
looked perfect, just as they were when I lent her the bus..... But then I
glanced over at the front axle beam..... hmm...

The joint on the beam that connects to the steering system was completly
mangled...the joint itself but more so the metal bracket on the beam. It
was all jagged and  twisted.... *much cursing*


She had apperantly hit a curb a month before and didn't have the heart to
tell me... I guess in the accident both tires blew and one rim was
destroyed....She just told me that the tires went... I saw the wheel...it
was absolutly mangled.... I guess the beam went along with it...
thats my explination... it looks pretty bad and I don't have the $$ for a
new beam, let alone the time or the place to fix it.

So I am here sadly to say that this is the end of Belushi. She is in far
poorer shape to fix than my other bus, and I could use her engine. I will
strip her down of most everything and have her towed away. :( *many tears*

If anyone is looking for oddball parts (camper, interior, etc) let me
know.... Or if anyone in the Cape Cod, Mass area wants to come by feel
free. I am planning on going over there wednesday of thursday this
week to take what I can.. 

as for the girlfriend.... well... I had to forgive her, although it
was very hard 
:)

Very sad,
Eddie
