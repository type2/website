Yes thats normal Landon
Have someone turn the engine over by hand while you watch
the valves.
Intake opens
Compression - then both valves close
Then exhaust valve opens
Each cylinder has this cycle it goes through as you probaly know.
Thats why you have to turn the engine to TDC to set the valves for
that cylinder. Both valves well be closed then on that CYLINDER
and only that cylinder. So only set the valves on one cylinder at a time 
till you move to TDC for the next cyl.
Or else you could get a tight valve and well we all know
what would soon happen after that, right class? :(

As far as your other post on the oil in the dizzy.
I'd try and figure out how it got there, unless
you want it to happen again ;) Which I am sure you dont.
Try and locate the leak or were it came from.
Is there any oil below the dizzy?
At the base of the crankcase breather thingy?

have fun!

---Org Msg------------
I'm adjusting my valses on my '72 Riviera for the first time and
have a question.  I got cylinder 1 to TDC and both valves were tight, no gap 
at all.  I adjusted it to 0.006 and moved the engine to cylinder 2 TDC.  
While adjusting them, I noticed that the one of the
valves for cylnder 1 was open and so I checked it with my feeler guage.  The 
gap was bigger than it was when I had the cylnder at TDC.
Moving the engine back to cylnder 1 at TDC I checked the gap again
and it was 0.006, so I looked at the valves of #2 and one of them
was open farther than 0.006.

So, I'm assuming that's normal, but wanted to check with the list
to be sure.

TIA,
Landon
