&gt;Also, as far as I can tell, the way this works is that when the bus is off

&gt;this correct?  Is this continuous drain and recharge of the main battery
&gt;safe (or smart) to do? Or should I rewire the things I want to run when the
&gt;bus is off to another fuse box which would be connected to the aux battery?

I thought it was the other way around: the aux would blindly drain away via the fused wired to the inside (and all that implies) and the main would be isolated so you could still start the bus and drive away in the morning.  The heavy wiring is on the main battery only with a small connecting wire following the breather lines under the top of the engine compartment.  I don't have a 2nd battery installed at the moment but everything is in place.

The battery relay wiring diagram is here:
