Subject: Por fuel tank sealer

Hi everyone,

FWIW, I used the fuel tank sealer kit on my tank about a year ago.
It then sat with out gas in it for about six months and has had
gas in it since Nov. and all systems are go.  No problems.
But I think this might be a better report if it had been several 
years.  I'll just have to wait I guess.  :)
