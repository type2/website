&gt;After you replace the sender, make a cover from sheet steel and secure it
&gt;down with self-tapping screws.  The cabin would be protected from gas
&gt;entering in the event of a tank rupture, a very rare occurance.

I am convinced.  I have to get a working sender unit in there.  I am not so
convinced about self tappers though.  Pop rivets might hold better.  Speedy
Jim was good enough to send me a GIF of the location to make the hole.  What
a valuable guy to have around.

&gt;By the way, this kind of repair/modification is approved by VW in Germany.

Some sort of lock down hatch would have been good.
