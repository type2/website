&gt; When this
&gt; T1 motor is placed where a T4 used to reside
&gt; there is no rear hanger needed
&gt; because the tranny is bolted in (not floating

&gt; the torque from the T1 is not enough to destroy
&gt; the tranny mounts which is
&gt; the reason the T4 has a rear hanger.

with this assertion?
