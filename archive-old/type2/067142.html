Subject: Gas Heaters According to Kath  :-)

Here are my two cents worth on the issue of gas heaters.

Before I did the resto-customization of Her Majesty (a '68 BUS - not a 
camper) my first concern was finding a good source of heat for her, 
since we live at 8,600 feet and our winters are nearly 9 months long. 
(we're getting SLAMMED as we speak) I would never have created her 
without first finding heat. It took me over 3 years to locate just the 
right source... for our needs. I sent JB's Heater Service the 5 bucks 
for the paperwork - then I called him to order one of his re-furbished 
Stewart-Warner &quot;Southwind&quot; heaters. I followed the advice he printed in 
his paperwork, which called for ordering the heater WAY before it got 
cold. I could tell from our first conversation that he was quite a 
pistol, and I treated him accordingly. He HATES to be rushed, so don't 
get hyper with him and NEVER utter the name Federal Express!!! He can't 
stand snivvelers so don't whine. Plus, remember that he operates at his 
own rate of speed and it might take you a month to get the heater - but 
it's worth the wait! 

When our heater arrived, it had EVERY conceivable part needed for the 
installation nicely packaged and labled - there was a photo of the way 
it should be installed and there was a hand drawn schematic. With me 
acting as the &quot;Gofer Queen&quot;, Mark and I had the thing installed with a 
rigid tail pipe in less than 6 hours. It's under the back seat - that 
does NOT fold down into a bed.

Since Her Purpleness isn't a camper a gas heater was exactly what we 
needed. Blazing heat while we're rolling. We never just sit around in 
her while she's no rolling - except at stop lights, of course.

:-)

A propane heater was out of the question for us. We don't sleep in her 
and we didn't want to install a propane tank. We went to great lenghts 
to keep her as simple as possible.

HA! You say! Simple? Victorian Tapestry is simple? Well - at least 
she's mechanically simple!!!

:-)

And to quote old Joe when I asked him if I needed to get an extra 
blower with the gas heater:

&quot;Lady, with 20,000 Btus crankin' through this puppy, you'll be bare ass 
naked in a snow storm with NO frost on your windshield!&quot;

'Nuff said!

Hope this helps any of you out there who are interested in heatin' it 
up!

P.S. JB advertises in the back of the VW mags - so you can get his 
number there.
