Subject: Re: Who's going to Jerome?

Budd Willis asked about the conditions at the Jerome Jamboree.

I'm sure Mr. Ellis aka Mr. Vanbondo will be able to tell you more than
I can but here goes.

Last time I was there was 3 years ago but I know they are camping at the
same place.  Basically it is a big, open, mostly dirt, field where they
camp.  They bring in a number of porta-potties and that's about it for
facilities at the camp site.  The town of Jerome is only about 1/2 mile
from the camp site and some food and water can be obtained there.  Jerome
also has some restaurants, bars, and lots of arty/touristy shops and 
ice-cream joints.  Jerome is on the side of a mountain (Mingus Mountain)
so there are nice views of the Verde Vally below from the camp site and
from town.  Bring a camera!  Plan on bringing some sort of camp-shower if
you want a shower.

Also, down the mountain, probably 10-12 miles away is the town of 
Cottonwood with has food stores, shopping centers, auto repair shops,
FLAPS, etc. etc.

There are some nicer areas to camp back up the mountain from Jerome a
few miles, up in the pine forests.  Where you camp depends on just how
involved you want to be in the whole she-bang.  Last time I was there
people near my tent continued to be rather noisy rather late so we pulled
up stakes about 1 AM and headed up the mountain to camp in the pines, a
beautiful place to wake up!  This year they say they will enforce the
&quot;quiet rules&quot; because there are people that live there at the Gold King Mine.

Lemme see, the flier I have lists the following activities:

* Monster caravan from Phoenix Saturday morning
* $10/carload, $5 if you are in *any* VW club
* camping
* car show with trophies
* big raffle, grand prize: 1959 7-door panel bus (fixed up quite nicely)
* swap meet
* chili cook-off
* slow drags
* amateur talent contest
* 'volksong', 'volkslore', and 'volksart' contests
* mine/ghost town tours
* more raffle

Thats this coming weekend, Sept. 14 &amp; 15
