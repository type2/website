Subject: Re: Tool FAQ, 12 point star, torx

Hi all -
Recently went through the CV stuff.  Here's my perspective.

&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;     torx-head -- if this is a 12 sided thing then a 6mm on has been 
&gt; suggested for cv work.  [Can someone else verify?]
&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;       I think list consensus is that 6mm Allen works on Allen Head
&gt; CV bolts and 8mm 12-point star works on 12-point Star CV bolts. TORX
&gt; is something else- 6 point stars, yes? 

TORX is a BRAND name and that means a 6 sided internal star shape.

For the CV's (at least on my '80) it takes an 8mm 12 point star tool. 
Few FLAPS know this tool, ask for a Torx, but with 12 points instead 
of 6 points.

&gt;       I've seen 12-point star tools that were 3/8&quot; socket tools AND
&gt; seen just a chunk of machined hex stock (I guess you add your own
&gt; 10 or 12mm socket if you're smart... I tried using it with the
&gt; correct open-end-wrench and couldn't make much progress. Like I said,
&gt; I've made every mistake I could think of!)

I've got'em 3 ways.  

8mm hex stock machined to the 12 point star.  
Don't use with an open wrench.  Not enough surface area to assure it 
won't round over or spring open your wrench.  Using a 8mm socket with 
the 12 point taped to the socket (prevent falling out), the 12 points 
were starting to round over after installation of only a few bolts.  $4.50

12 point fixed on a 3/8&quot; socket.  Broke after severe torqueing.  
Severe torqueing due to click type torque wrench falling apart, so 
unknown torque applied. $unknown some years ago

Latest one, not used yet.  Waiting for dry day to re-torque with 
repaired and sorta calibrated torqued wrench.  Hardened 5/16&quot; hex 
with 12 point 8mm star.  $3.50

Note: the bolts are hardened.
