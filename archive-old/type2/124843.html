Subject: fresh air tubes (was - cheap muffler)

When using the style of header shown in the link below, I have found that a
hole gets burned through the flexible aluminum fresh air tubes where the
tube passes close to the header. Is there a way of preventing this or do I
just plan on replacing the tubes on a regular basis?

Thanks,
Bill Moon

| I used to have an EMPI dual quiet pack and it was just terrible quality,
| bolted to a wide collector but was actually quite constricted, the header
| fit like crap too.
|
| For type 1 engines, I recommend the Quiet One (header and muffler kit)
sold
| by CB Performance.  Fits good and has a thunderbird (USA) muffler, not too
| quiet, not too loud, good throaty sound. it is a single quiet pack design
| with a wide collector flange:
