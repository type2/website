Subject: Lighting Question

Okay, I've purchased the &quot;Headlight Conversion Kit, H4 Halogen, Set, incl.
12 v bulbs, 63-79 Bus, 80-85 Vanagon&quot;
http://199.217.241.240/partsimages/HQ6014.JPG from the bus depot. I plan on
wiring the relay system myself instead of shelling out $60 for a kit. Where
locally or online can I find:

1. The male socket adaptor that will fit into the bus's existing headlight
socket ( this will trigger the new relays)
2. The connectors for the H4 headlights.

Is it true that the connectors are the same between the existing sealed beam
headlights and my new lights, so a person could just do a simple swap? I'm
not planning on doing this, I'm just asking the question.

Are there any advantages to running both the high and low beams during high
beam operation?
