Subject: Friday: Looking for Bob Vega
Mime-Version: 1.0

List,

Does anyone know the (new?) e-address of Bob Vega, previously of
Southern California and president of one of the So Cal VVW groups
out there?? He was rebuilding a set of ambulance fans for me and
none of his old addresses work.  Any help locating him (and my
fans!!) would be most appreciated.

Many thanks,
Craig in CO
