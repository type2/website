Subject: Heaters and CO

Just a quick reminder to everyone now that heater season is upon us that the
CO (like that produced by our combustion heaters) kills hundreds in North
America ever year. A 9v powered CO alarm is costs about the same as a smoke
alarm, is available at your local home improvement store, and could save the
lives of those you love.
Cheers, and wishing you warm bussing,
