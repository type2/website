A Brandy Psmythe wrote about 'blind spots'

You guys need to realise that women aren't built like you! - I would hope that
you know this anyway:-) and one woman's blind spot is another man's ergonomic
specification, especially in the days when our Type 2's were built.

I was scared of driving our bus, Ektor, for years, but now, with chunky leather
(mmm...) Volvo seats replacing the low and mean VW originals (don't panic, they
are stored safely for the next owner) I'm happy to take to the road.

Remember, women were meant to drive Karmann Ghias (see below!), if we were meant
to drive buses, we would have sent VW's marketing department into a spin!

Best Wishes, Gillian Dunkerley
