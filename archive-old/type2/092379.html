Subject: Re: [T2] Wierd Junkyard Find.

[...]

&gt;&gt;Yep, some folks manage to find the tin they used in Europe to seal the
engine bay up with a 1600 installed.  I ran across a 79 westie here in Portland with the &quot;euro&quot; tin and a fuel injected 1600 from a late beetle installed.

I would imagine with almost 20 less horsepower and the taller gearing in
the later 091 trans it was a_bit_slow up the hills.  : )
&lt;&lt;
---------------------------------

That's about what one would expect with that combination, however...

Rich and Amanda Ligato have traveled from Southern California to South Africa in just such a vehicle.  They've traveled all over S. America, crossing high passes in the Andes along the way, and shipped their Westy to Africa from Valparaiso, Chile.  Route maps and messages en route are on their website:  http://www.vwvagabonds_dot_com/index.html

They had their mechanic install a 1600 engine in their 1978 Westfalia specifically for this journey, and he custom fabricated the engine tin.  They wanted the 1600 for reliability, ready availability of parts, and ease of repair if necessary.  They are running the original 1978 transaxle without modification, and to top it off they have an 009 distributor.  The only real engine problems they've had were a pulley failure and a silted up carburetor, and those happened in S. Africa.

They intend to drive N. through Africa to Egypt, and perhaps all the way to N. Europe, before returning to the States with their trusty VW.

FWIW...
