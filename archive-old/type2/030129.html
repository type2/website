they're currently in production in a junkyard in Sun Valley, CA, as I
understand

&gt; Wonder if the Brit host would come back - I preferred him over the US dude.

I doubt it.  He had &quot;other committments&quot;, most notably a starring role in
Red Dwarf.  I liked him too.

&gt; I could just see Hoover cutting up some poor old VW and cussing the whole 
&gt; time about why they should have found an old Fiat to hack up instead

I don't know if Hoover made it on or not.  He was close-mouthed about it
and disappeared from the newsgroup right after.  He either made it and
got busy or didn't and left in disgust.
