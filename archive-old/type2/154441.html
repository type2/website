Subject: Re: [T2] What engine is this?

Thanks Ron! I actually just went out and double checked and realized that 
that IS where I got the number from. This motor didn't even have a fan 
shroud on it. There was a Porsche 914 in the yard too and someone was 
already pulling the motor out as I walked by it.. (wonder if that was a 
2000cc too???).

Is there a way that I can tell what kind of power increase there was between 
my 1800cc and this 2000cc?

What was the main reason why Volkswagen went with larger motors? Was it to 
try to get more power in light of all the new emissions restrictions? It 
seems weird to me because GM, Ford, and Chrysler all went to SMALLER engines 
from 1970 going forward, rather than larger motors... (in hopes of reducing 
emissions, improving fuel economy, etc...). Was VW immune to this?


Thanks!!!

Todd

&gt; The only number I saw was &quot;GD042787&quot;.


GD engine code would be a '76-77 2000cc solid-lifter Bus engine. You can
find the number stamped on the top of the block near the oil breather. It is
also on the fan shroud, but all that really proves is that the fan shroud
was from a '76-77.
