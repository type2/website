The Coleman Camping Toilet is what you want for your temporary need and then
for use in your bus. I have seen one at K-Mart for under $60.

We bought a new, unused one at a Yard Sale for our 72 camper, and the best
part is it fits under the jump seat. The height was fine for me as I usually
rest on my knees when I use it, however for the wife it sat a little low, so
I used two 2x6 under it and it raised it to the perfect height, the seat
cushion still fits and no one knows it's there. The other day my Sister was
checking out our camper and was talking about how neat it was and said the
only thing it needed was a toilet, so I raised the seat and she FLIPPED
OUT!!!

Another good advantage about this unit is it has two separate compartments,
one that holds flushing water, and a lever activated blocked off holding
tank The two pieces separate for cleaning purposes and has a large opening
on the holding tank, however we have never needed the large hole as we have
only had to use it for &quot;one&quot; thing :-)

I hope this helps and good luck with your home project!

Meredith
