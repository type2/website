What's the temperature in Minneapolis right now. My '75 and I were living in 
Georgia, and now we're in Maine it has the same symptom -- real hard to pull 
away from a cold start. I think it's the transmission grease thickening up in 
our cold weather. It's far, far worse when it's twenty below than twenty 
above, but twenty above is still worse than fourty. Once the tranny has run a 
hundred yards or so, the problem is gone. 

I was wondering if I should put in a lighter weight of grease.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Hello fellow list members~

My roommate from here in San Francisco is out traveling for a few months, 
and after making the trek from SF to Or and back, then on to Minnesota 
without a problem, the westy is suddenly in need of help and she isn't 
having much luck finding an air-cooled VW guy to work on it.

She has a 74 westfalia, and it was running wonderfully before she left.
What is happening now is &quot;When I finally get it started, it feels like the 
back end is sitting in Mud, it just doesn't want to move&quot; - her words, not 
mine.
I do not even know what that could be, so if anyone has any suggestions for 
a good Minneapolis VW guy that could come out and take a look, or she could 
get in touch with that would be super!

She has a place to stay there, so it isn't an AIRS issue, but she will need 
to get it running to find a temp job and such for the period of time she 
will be staying there.



Christopher
76 Westy - &quot;honey&quot;
