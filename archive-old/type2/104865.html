&gt;This sounds to me like something is screwed up with the valve train

&gt;I'd ask the tech who wrote that note what he/she means here.  [snip]

Could it be a problem of cam not being correctly aligned with the
crank?

Yes, I guess it could be, and might be overlooked by the tech who wrote the
note regarding the inability to adjust the adjusters properly.  This can be
checked without tearing the engine down by noting how the valves are moving
as the related piston comes up to TDC.

&gt;Since this is an AVP engine determine what the tech is saying and then call
&gt;Leonard and discuss it with him.  He can be difficult to get a hold of -
&gt;you'll probably reach his wife first - and talk through the possibilities.

My emails have not been answered. I'll call them on Monday. Is
Leonard's wife called Erin? She was the one who delivered the engine.

Yes, that's her.
