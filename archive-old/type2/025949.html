Hi Volks,

Just got home from &quot;Buses By the Falls&quot;, the campout Jamie Rivers held in
Niagara Falls Ontario in conjunction with the Niagara Volks Folks &quot;June
JitterBug&quot; VW show.

Friday Night after work I piled the wife and kids into the bus and slapped
on the white magnetic maple leaves that lend the bus it's character. We
first drove to my parents, where we formed up a small Carabus with their
Vanagon Westy to head off to Niagara Falls. The buses ran smoothly and we
pulled into the Campark resort about 9PM, to find a few campers already set
up there; Jamie Rivers &amp; Family, Bob and Fiona Weber, Mike &amp; Tina Moore and
their '59 Fire-Bus, Ted Finesman and his tricked-out 71 Westy, plus a few
others. Also present was a EuroVan Winnebago connversion owned by Joe and
Lydia Gardisch who came down from up near Parry Sound, making 4 generations
of VW's at the camp. Ted brought some of his &quot;spiritually enhanced&quot; cherries
around and we all relaxed and chatted late into the night.

Saturday we woke up to a slightly damper campsite than the one we went to
bed in, but the skies cleared steadily all weekend. I set up shop in my
Dad's kitchen tent, and Dad, Colleen and I made a pancake breakfast for all
in attendance. After that we played with a Go-Ped, rode our bikes and went
for a swim and Hot-Tub. Ted Finesman and his wife went off for a ride on the
Maid-Of-The Mist, while some others went off to try their luck at the
casino. I took a little time to get a closer look at the Fire-Bus, and
chatted with Dennis Jolliffe and Collie Corner when they showed up around
1PM. Later on I got to meet Mark Strenzke and his very nice 71 westy...
Great work, Mark!

It was a laid-back afternoon, and after an early dinner we headed off to the
restaurant where the Volks Folks cruise night was gathering. This was a fun
crowd, lots of beetles, plenty of outrageous custom VW's and some very
meticulous stock restorations as well. There was an engine tear-down
competition in the parking lot, Jamie Rivers and Dennis Jolliffe entered as
&quot;Team Fossil&quot;. Unfortunately Team Fossil lost out in their first heat, but
as it turned out there weren't *any* winners working on the motor they got
stuck with, so I don't think it was their fault. The cruise got going just
before dusk and rolled past the Falls twice, the falls looked as spectacular
as ever.  

After the cruise we headed back to camp, put the kids to bed, and Jamie
convened the crowd and started the evenings presentations. Jamie seemed a
bit uneasy at first but got the hang of emcee'ing pretty quick, and he and
his wife Ruth did a great job of distributing the swag. Once that was out of
the way I unloaded my digital camera into my powerbook and ran a slide show
on the picnic table. I headed off to bed at 12:30, knowing the morning would
come early and there was lots to do to get the campsite packed down and get
to the Jitterbug on time. Next morning we woke at 8, rushed breakfast and
rolled up the campsite by 10 and were out with no trace of our passage by
10:15. 

The June JitterBug was a lot bigger show than I expected, and had more than
45 buses being shown, plus wads of beetles new and old, and other
watercooled as well. There was plenty for the kids to do, and lots of stuff
in the swap meet as well. One of the things I missed seeing was the
&quot;Clutch-Eater&quot;, a teeter-totter device that drivers had to roll their car
onto and balance it precisely for a certain amount off time. I saw lots of
cool buses, only a few splitties but lots of nice Bays and a really awesome
custom Vanagon with a 190HP Porsche 911 engine. I showed my WestFakia
conversion to a few people and had a great time in a field full of VW's on a
bright Summer day.

We had to bail out early from the Jitterbug as I had a business call to make
on the way home, but as it turned out we caught up with Dennis Jolliffe on
the highway just before he split off our path and headed north rather than
East as we were going.

THANKS to Jamie Rivers for co-ordinating such a cool event, we're looking
forward to returning to it next year.

Happy trails,

Greg &amp; Collen Potts &amp; Family
