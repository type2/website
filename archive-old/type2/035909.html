Valid point. We would have to be selective. Another way around this would 
be to make a well-designed sample of 20 parts for each batch of buses 
(68-70, 71, 72, 73-74, 75-78, 79) and try to draw conclusions from what 
we learn.

Or another way around this is that when I ask both Bus Depot and the list 
about the quality of valve adjusters through you, I were to get an answer.
