Subject: [T2] 52 split window for sale

hey volks,
just saw this on the type 2 classifieds and thought id
pass it along as someone might be able to get a good
deal on a project.   sounds like a 21 or 13 window bus
and the guy doesnt know what he has.  you now now as
much as me.  if someone could, please pass along to
the vintage list.  contact him not me:

This van is complete, but seems to have alot of rust
on roof. There are windows along side of roof that I
guess someone put in???? Anyway need it off my
