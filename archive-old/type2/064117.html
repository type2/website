&quot;....I really want to find a 
&gt;     source for American or German bearings.  Gainesville, Fl has no decent 
&gt;     foreign parts stores if you drive anything out of the norm.  The VW 
&gt;     dealer doesn't want us drivers of older vehicles anywhere near their 
&gt;     shop.  It's a sign of the times children.  We're on our own and 
&gt;     frankly I'm beginning to appreciate that!  Back to VW content:  So, 
&gt;     I'm saving the Timkens for emergency use and Lea and I installed the 
&gt;     new Chinese units.

I guess I should count my blessings for living in an agricultural area. We
have 3 bearing shops in town, all of which carry most of the major brands of
wheel bearings. So not only do I have a great selection, but they are also
very inexpensive (the three shops are really competitive). I took the
bearings from my bug - all the wheel bearings were completely shot &lt;shudder&gt;
- - and had a bearing shop match them up with new ones. 

I followed my shop manuals instructions of inspecting the bearings every
time I had the front wheel apart. When I started doing the restoration of my
bug, I looked at the caged ball bearings - no scratches etc. GREAT. Then I
happened to glance at the bearing race - there was very little chrome left
on it, as it was completely worn out - doh! Make sure that you inspect the
bearings races when you are inspecting  the bearings. 

Since my bug had Fag bearings, so I stuck with the same brand. I decided to
'upgrade' from ball bearings to tapered rolling bearings, on the advice of
the bearing shop. I also had the bearing shop mic the i.d. and o.d. of the
new bearings to make sure they match (I had some bad experiences with parts
that don't fit). I haven't finished the body work (rear bumper mounts) or
the brakes, and winter is quickly coming. The little bug will have to wait
until next year to 'road test' the new bearings. At least it's inside a cozy
little garage for the winter.

I haven't seen/heard of a Chinese brand of bearings. I'm not surprised
though, since a lot of manufactured products are from China. So, how many
countries are IN your VW? At last count I had 8.

Once the bug is restored (it should be painted in 2 years, but drivable next
year), I'll be able to look for a single or double cab (pre '65). Until that
time, I'll remain a wannabus.
