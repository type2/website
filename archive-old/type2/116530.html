Subject: re: an urgent Cry for help!

From: Sunbugg16_at_aol_dot_com

&gt;The bus won't make such a long trip  by herself. I can't afford the cost of a 
&gt;transportation service to have my bus shipped back to Virginia and I don't 
&gt;have a truck or trailer so I am in quite a hard place. Im moving back to Virginia 
&gt;on the 27th of this month and I'm franticlly trying to find a way to get her 

You don't say exactly what makes you feel the bus won't make it.  Does it run?  Are you in a hurry?  IMO if at all possible, consider spending the 
money on repairs (before or as you go) -- you'll not only get to drive the bus on a memorable road trip, but you'll have a better running bus when you 
get there.   Muir talks about starting trips with a marginal bus, taking tools and spares, and ending the trip with a better running car.

Take the AIRS list with you, maybe even contact a few people on it ahead of time.

Just a thought....
