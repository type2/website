 Hello,
 
 I am looking for either a used or rebuilt motor for my 79 bus.
 Any ideas on price for a used or rebuilt?
 
 I will be  installing the motor myself to help defray some of the cost.
 
 
 Thanks 
 Rob &gt;&gt;

you can do an upright conversion on it, helps defray costs-   I did this on 
an 80 vanagon last month.  Drives nice now, a lot more power than the worn 
out 2L with a slipping clutch.  used an intake with the attachment for the 
booster for the disc brakes.
