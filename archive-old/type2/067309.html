Subject: RE: Where I Live

I live in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

My daily ride is a 72 nonpoptop Westy (AKA &quot;Male Menopause&quot;) but I also own
a 73 Thing (AKA &quot;The Money Pit&quot;). My son is taking our 72 Super Beetle to
his new job in Memphis.

Chronologically, I'm 50; maturationally, probably around 16 or 17.

There are a couple of good places locally, Foreign Parts just over the
state line in Ft Oglethorpe, Ga., Harry Guinn, who sold Beetles on the gray
market in the early 60's operates it.  The other place is Lockhart's VW
Service,located in downtown Chattanooga and operated by Jimmy Lockhart who
is an honest and competent mechanic. GREAT person who does really good work
at reasonable prices.

There are about 30 or 40 busses locally loosed linked as the Scenic City
Transporters Society. We know each other and get together from time to time
but not as formally as we used to.
