hello again list.

last night i saw the first 5-10 min. of a movie &quot;The Odessa File&quot;.
i think it was made around 74-ish? not sure, though.

anywho, withing the first couple of minutes of the movie i saw so
many ACVWs.  there was a beautiful Ambulance Bus. it had a red body &amp;
a white roof. but the movie never showed a shot of INSIDE the bus.

i am just curious to what the inside of the ambulance buses looked like.
anyone got any pics?

TIA &amp; happy friday to all.
