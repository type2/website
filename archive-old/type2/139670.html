Subject: Re: [T2] power coating

Dave,

I don't know about your store , but the one here says they will honor the 
internet prices....

Might be worth asking for.

Got an oven for mine in the same sort of deal....just remember you will 
need 220 volts for it.  Which means a large double breaker, some serious 
wire, and a receptacle for the plug.

All of that will be about 5X more  than the cost of the oven.

Cheers, dave

&gt; They're on the webpage now for $59.99, the store has them for $99.99.  Now
&gt; that I have my internet service back (down for 3 days), I'm going to print

&gt; Found an Oven for $10 at a donation store, ready to give it a try.
