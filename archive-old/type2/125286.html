&gt; So you have a Rio Car too!!
&gt; I have one with a 40 gig hard drive and don't know how I ever lived
&gt; without it. It's an incredible unit, way ahead of its time. I put extra
&gt; sleeves in my other cars (an old Mini Cooper, a Fiat 500, and a Fiat
&gt; Spider) so I can move the same head unit from car to car.  (If you
&gt; haven't already, do the Emplode hack; it adds a lot of very useful
&gt; features.)

Already Emploded. :O)

I'm about to rip five more of my personal CD's into the unit tonight.
Finally figured out how to activate the visuals, the graphics that do their
thing to the MP3's while they play.  Really cool.

Have you done the light-up hack for the buttons?  Mine's not done, but I had
borrowed a unit with the hack installed.  I'm working on some clear tinted
buttons for the hack, along with some colored plates for the fascia.
