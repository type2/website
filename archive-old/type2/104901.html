Subject: Re: [T2] singleport doghouse pix

To save space I'll answer both questions I received.  As I already replied to 
Karl, I didn't install the thermostat, the longblock wasn't drilled &amp; tapped 
and I need to get this bus running again.  I will probably do it at a later 
date, but I did notice the Sp head alignment isn't quite right for the 
doghouse flap lever.  It doesn't look that far off though.  I think Mark 
Dearing has that solution - Mark?

As far as compression ratio goes, while I had the heads off I went ahead and 
did the deck height measurements and CCd the heads and was quite pleased to 
learn that my Crs work out as follows, #1 -&gt; #4: 6.98 7.02 7.04 7.01  I 
couldn't get it any better if I had tried.  I don't live in Miami and more 
(matter of fact I live there much less thank you) so didn't feel the need for 
a mid-6 Cr.  

I live in the mountainous area of NC and 7:1 seems to work around here 
according to the folks I've talked to, some with significant experience 
building engines that last.  The DP doghouse in the Burrito Express is about 
7:1 and even making the hill to Boone my oil temp stays below 200, so I'll 
stick with what's working.

&gt; Dave,
&gt; What did you do with the rod between the right flap and the thermostat?
&gt; I never could get it to work. The arm hole on doghouse flaps and the rod
&gt; hole in single port heads do not line up.
