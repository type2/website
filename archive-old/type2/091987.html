Subject: drag link is a drag


I hope everyones weekend was good. I got a lot done on my bus. I 
replaced the ball joints,tie rods,calipers,rotors,bearings,pads,sway bar
bushings,steering box,and tried to get the drag link on. I had 
everything on except the drag link and had done a measure tape alignment.
I went to put on the drag link but it hits the metal cross member it 
goes though. When I compare it to the old original one length is the same,
but the dip in the pipe is in a different spot. It's made by Meyle. Do I 
need to trim the cross member as all replacements are like this or
do I have the wrong one? I have a 78 Westy. If anyone else is in the 
market for a steering box email me and I'll tell you my story on
the purchase of mine. Whose box to avoid. Again thanks for any help with 
the drag link. I can't wait to test drive it.

Bill
