If the problem is that one of the forks has broken off, it's best to
simply reweld it onto the shaft.  Weld it all the way around, not just
at the edges as it was originally done.  This will give you a better
part than the original or any replacements you can find.

The clutch fork is a weak spot, and I weld up the forks the first
chance I get, even if they aren't broken yet.  Good insurance.
