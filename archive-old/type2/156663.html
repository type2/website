Subject: Re: Tom Noble Engines in seattle

Don't ask me why! But when I do a search in Google for Tom Noble Engines, I don't get anything at all.
BUT... when I put in Tom Noble Seattle in Google, I get a direct link for directions to Tom Noble Engines Inc.


This is the information I see:

Tom Noble Engines Inc
1414 NW 53rd St
Seattle, WA 98107
(206) 783-4778

My guess is that he sold that property for a profit and moved.

Is that address anywhere near your?


Here is the link:

http://www.google_dot_com/maps?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=tom+noble&amp;near=Seattle,+WA&amp;cid=0,0,14752587261595725882&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;om=1&amp;ll=47.668711,-122.373748&amp;spn=0.013699,0.027552


If that link is too long and doesn't work, just remember to put it in google as &quot;Tom Noble Seattle&quot;.


I hope that was helpful, and hopefully they are still around...

&gt;Anyone ever heard of this outfit and where they ran off to? 
&gt;I drove past the address listed but its a parking garage now which I half
&gt;expected. The phone number goes to VM.
&gt;
&gt;Anyone heard of this guy(shop)?
