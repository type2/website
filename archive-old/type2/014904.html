Forgive me Father, for I have blasphemed St. Muir...

I made a sarcastic comment about Muir in the &quot;engine hesitation&quot; thread, 
but I was doing it to make a point.  Someone said that I had put blind 
faith in the evil engineers of VW in my assertion that vacuum advance 
distributors are superior to centrifugal ones in stock dual port engines 
with the 34 PICT 3 carb.  I was pointing out the hypocrisy of quoting 
Muir on the issue of &quot;blind faith&quot;.

The &quot;Idiot Book&quot; does give something to the VW community.  It empowered 
VW owners by demystifying mechanical processes and letting them know 
that they COULD be their own mechanic.  John put things in a language 
that anyone with a 9th grade education could understand.  I applaud him 
for that.

Some of his recommendations in the book, however, are just plain wrong.  
Realise that he wrote it back in the sixties and VWs were somewhat 
disposeable back then.  They were also 30 years newer.  They could 
handle a few more &quot;band-aid&quot; fixes and still get you home.

If you don't recognize that, there are some things Muir recommends that 
could be detrimental to your VW.

Every time I sell a bus I recommend the owner get a copy of the idiot 
book and READ it, then always keep it in the bus.  But I tell them to take 
some of it with a grain of salt and that it is NOT the Gospel according to 
proper VW repair.  I also recommend they get an appropriate Bentley if 
they plan to do any of their own mechanical work.

Hopefully Steve will take me off Double-Secret Probation now...

Dave

P.S.  How can I be a racist?  Some of my best friends are stoners...
      I'm not prejudiced at all, I hate everyone I see.
