&gt; It sounds like you're talking about the EGR (Exhaust Gas
&gt; Recirculation)pipe
&gt; that runs from the EGR valve connected to the left front of the air
&gt; intake
&gt; distributor

I've been wondering... just what is the point of the EGR valve anyway. I
don't see how it can recirculate enough 'unburned fuel' to make a
difference in the air quality- what can it recirculate.. 5%? and of
that, what is the percentage of unburned fuel?
