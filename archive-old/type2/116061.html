Subject: Re: [T2] Heater Cables

&gt; Hello All,
&gt; 
&gt; I need to replace the other two.

&gt; Anyone have any ideas on where to
&gt; get these cables?

darren,

i have replaced both of those cables on my '79.

the short cable is find-able at a junkyard, if you can find a junkyard that
has any busses. i think there are many years of baywindow that use the same
one, i think i got one from a junkyard 74 a year or so back. it had the
dealer sticker still on it and was perfect! i was happy to find it. the
other i am not so sure about, but you might purchase a heaterbox control
cable and modify it to suit. if my memory serves me, the one under the floor
has a loop or hook at the under-floor end, not a swaged ferrule, so it could
be made by cutting one of the heaterbox controls shorter. at any rate i
think modifying another similar part is the only avenue.

the under-floor cable is a total pain in the butt to get at. the access to
it is almost completely blind. mine had fallen out of place under the floor,
and it took me about 2 hours to get it attached properly again, and i had
the bus on a hoist at the time. there might be an easier way, but i couldn't
figure it out at the time. you might need lots of patience to get that one
fixed. good luck.
