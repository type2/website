Subject: Bay Area Bentleys

This won't interest people outside the SF Bay Area.

Went to the local library on a tip that they had almost all of the Bentleys
(yes all of them) but found out they've been warehoused until Fall 2004 when
the library will move from their temporary location to a new one. The
library only brought a small number of books to their temporary location.

Can anyone give me a tip for a library system that has these before I do a
systematic search of them all (there are a lot out here).
