&gt;How come 72-79 pickups are so rare in the United States--or is it just me? I'd love to find a doublecab especially, but this seems impossible. I'd just like to know why these are so hard to find.

If I'm not mistaken, it's because they were never sold in the U.S..  I think the only ones in the U.S. were imported from Canada or other foreign countries.  I never remember seeing one at a dealership during those years.
