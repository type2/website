Subject: Re: Re:Need help with possible engine purchase

That's probably what I'm going to do anyway. Get this motor for a quick fix. 
Maybe the fuel injection components can become the foundation for a future 
Megasquirt conversion.

Thanks for all your help. Your input has helped provide the information I 
need for this decision.

If the Porsche engine comes to you as a good deal then buy it and run it.
As far as the tranny's go Porsche puts the pilot bearing in the flywheel and
VW puts the pilot bearing in the end of the crank. It's about 1/2&quot; to 3/4&quot;
difference that might give you some transmission options.
