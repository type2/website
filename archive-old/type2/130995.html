Subject: RE: [T2] Rear Wheel Not Turning

I think you got it Chris.

71 brakes changed mid year, looks like from 8/70-7/71 are the same and 8/71 
- 12/72 are the same. I remember when I had to do rear brakes on my other 71 
I had to look at my numbers to figure out if I was early or late 71.

Hope this helps.
