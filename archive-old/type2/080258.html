Subject: Items for trade or giveaway - '73 Transporter

I'd like to trade for something I need for my Westy (I need several little 
things so let's talk) but if you really need them and are short on cash - 
come get 'em.

They are located along I-40 in Cookeville, TN between Knoxville and Nashville.

I also have a very heavy duty trailer hitch we built that I don't need 
anymore. Utilizes a reciever hitch, ties to bumper, both bumper brackets 
and under the front tranny mount. Will handle more than your bus will. Also 
protects the bottom of the drivetrain if you are off road - acts like a 
skid plate. Sorry no pics available b/c I don't have a digital camera (yet).

Again I'd like make a trade, sell it for $50, or I'll work something out 
with you. Can't ship it.

Just trying to clean up the yard.
