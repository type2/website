I would recommend you consider &quot;door skins&quot; to re-ceil your bus. Some 
lumberyards have this stuff-it's a VERY thin veneer used to re-face doors. 
Home Depot, Lowes, usually have it. Smaller local yards can get it. About a 
1/16 of an inch or so in thickness. It's bendy, so it will take the curve.
