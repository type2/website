So what was done to pass it?

&gt; No out-of-pocket for me as I'd already spent more than
&gt; the Co-pay with the VW dealer.

When I went for my own test I learned about these changes to the assistance
program.

The low income eligibility for repair assistance has been expanded to cover
failures at test-only stations. If you fail emissions for any reason except
tampering you can apply for repair assistance. The deductable is $100 on
repair work costing up to $600.
