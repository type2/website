&gt; With the compufire we can assume that it is triggering reliably and this 
&gt; is not a points problem. So, the next things to check are:

I will make that assumption for now, especially because the megasquirt 
is reading a very clean tach (cleaner than points).


&gt; 1) The rotor. Check for cracks and the right resistance. Smooth the end 
&gt; or replace if it is pitted or burned.

Cleaned.  Didn't look too bad.


&gt; 2) The distributor cap. Again, look for burning on the terminals, cracks 

Also inspected and cleaned it and it looked ok.


&gt; 3) The plug wires. I don't trust testing resistance on the wires because 

They're new plug wires that only have about 4000 miles on them.


&gt; 4) The coil. Coils fail rarely, but they do. More usually you can get a 

New bosch blue coil.  However, I will go through and clean the 
connections and make sure there isn't a short.  I might also just 
temporarily pull the reverse light so that there isn't anything else 
messin' with the circuit.


&gt; 5) Check for constant 13.5 volts at the coil + . I had a problem once 

MS is getting 13.8, but that's off the battery, though.  I will check 
the voltage at the coil.


&gt; 6) Replace the plugs. You can't really check them and if you haven't 

These only have 4000 miles on them, but heck, I'll go for new ones anyways.


&gt; 7) Compression check?

140-145 all around


&gt; 8) Fuel pressure check? Not usually a problem at idle, but sometimes the 

Holds rock solid.


&gt; The best thing to do is to track the spark back from the plugs and make 
&gt; sure that every thing is within spec every step of the way. Don't 

I'm going to trace back through everything again and see what I can 
figure out.  I'm also tempted to send off a set of injectors to get 
cleaned and see if that helps out... I'll keep ya updated!
