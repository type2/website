Subject: Re: [T2] Have you ever floored your motor?

&gt; I know that EVERY
&gt; single automotive editor and publisher in the business will continue
&gt; to use the vernacular (motor) instead of the technically-correct term
&gt; of engine.

Is that why they call it Motortrend instead of Enginetrend magazine?
