Chuck,

First, the rental set from whatever company rents you the dolly is just
*easier*, as it will plug right in and clamp on.   The two times I have
towed cars for any distance, that was the way I went.

But, second, if you want to use the vehicle lights you can either run a
harness along the side of the bus and plug them in at the tailight buckets
or do as follows for direct connections to the systems:

driving lights - just turn them on;

brake lights   - there is no fuse between the switches on the master
                 cylinder and the lights.  You would need to unplug the
                 wires from the switches and plug in your feed from the
                 towing vehicle.  The wiring diagram indicates an eight-
                 connector multi-plug between the switch and the lights in
                 the rear, but I don't remember where that connector is
                 located.

turn signals   - the easiest place to feed power to the turn
                 signals is at the emergency flasher switch.  Look for a
                 black wire with a green trace (right) and a black wire
                 with a white trace (left).
