&gt;Hi List,
&gt;
&gt;Just got my '72 camper back on the road after a long hibernation for the
&gt;winter.  I have developed quite a fuel smell after a full fill up at the gas
&gt;station. 
&gt;
My 75 has a paint can lid type access lit in the engine compartment just 
ahead of the battery and just above the wheel well. Pops off with a 
screw driver. just enough access to change the filler neck if you have 
lots of patients and small arms and hands. Not sure if the 72 has the 
same arrangement. You might also consider changing out the little rubber 
hoses on the gas tank vent lines. This can cause the same symptoms but 
requires access to the gas tank. I assume the 72 has the lid between the 
engine compartment and gas tank area, if so I hear its a bear to remove 
with the engine in the bus but can be done. I did mine while engine was 
out for rebuild.
Hope this helps.
Tom
