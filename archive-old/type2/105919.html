&gt; My high school friend's dad flies anti-weed helicopter missions
&gt; in santa cruz (buddie's a stoner of course) and he got a military
&gt; chopper joystick to put on the gearshift in his Thing.
&gt; Pretty hot, I always told him to wire stuff up to the triggers.

That is so cool!

I'd thought about casting one of the new knobs and hollowing one out with
the Dremel to see what would fit into it (there's room for at least a thumb
button &amp; wires).  I had a passing thought about trying to fit the guts from
one of those old three-button weapon key ring fobs into it (the ones that
make different weapon sounds), but haven't figured out if all of the buttons
would fit somewhere on the knob.

Got to get it done first. :O)
