Subject: Where the vans are

Well, the rains came down, and college reopened, and the vans crawled 
back on the streets.

In the last 3 weeks, I've seen more splitties than I've seen in the last 
year. There's a to-die-for 59 (?) over near the campus tonight, and 
across the street a couple other decent looking rigs to boot.

OK, sightings are not as common as the 68+ vans, but they are averaging 
3 or 4 NEW sighted vans a week.

On the van list posted for last week's Oregonian, the 66 van is a typo 
in the paper, the 60 23-window has rust in the cargo area, the 65 Camper 
is tentatively sold (and will be sold to me if the purchaser backs out 
in paying for it monday). The 67 bus splittie is sold, as is the 66 
&quot;classic&quot;.

Oh well, at least I made a good contact on the 65. The owner restores 
old vans and has a 62 coming up next summer, if I haven't found one by 
then.
