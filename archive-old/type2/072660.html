Subject: any good vw welders in MN?

Hi, I'm looking for someone to weld my bus!  Every bodyshop I call won't
work on it. Either they say that's a restoration project &amp; we don't do
that, or they aren't interested because it's a vw or a classic car.  I'd be
willing to travel the state of minnesota or north/west WI.  If anybody
knows someone that loves working on vw's please tell me.  I will eventually
be getting it painted, so if you know anyone for that job also...

as always... thanks in advance,
Keri
