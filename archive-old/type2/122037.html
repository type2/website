Subject: Re: [T2] door sealant warning

Someone may have already mentioned this but, NASA developed WD-40 to 
displace water in their rockets.  If my space camp memory serves me 
correct it was used on o rings.

Mission Commander, Falcon Flight Team, 1988...I was in the 6th 
grade...it was cool.

&gt; you might try wd-40. I do KNOW that it can be used to help take off
&gt; stickers and tape from painted bus metal parts. worth a shot. (plus I
&gt; just wanted to make another wd-40 post :)
