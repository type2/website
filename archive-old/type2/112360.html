Subject: help with meter bus running poorly

After taking my bus out of the garage from the winter it ran great for a few weeks. I haven't really driven it a lot though. It started running poorly which bring me here. The idle is irregular. It never stay the same.
It seems to run okay while driving except when I come to a stop the idle can be anywhere. I did check timing dwell,replaced the points,cap and rotor. I also checked some of the fuel injection stuff with an ohm meter.
I did this all on the 20K scale. What should I be using? Here is what I found.
timing 7.5 before
dwell 47.1
aux air valve,cold open when warm shut
vacumn at idle 15
temp sender on head 2.74 20k scale aprox 65F 
thermotime switch .03 at aprox  65F  .06 from freezer
couldn't find any vacumn leaks
motor has around 3,000 on it. New last spring(cold start valve and all injectors)
Is the temp sender and thermo switch bad?

Bill
