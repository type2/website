I have built a pre heater/air cleaner for my bus,which runs a 2.0 type4 
with a progressive kit. it works but the manifold still get cold. my 
next idea is to use the heat from the top of the case to warm up that 
manifold. has anybody done any thing like this. BTW I made the air 
cleaner out of two late bus hubcaps, two rabbit hubcaps , two 90 degree 
pvc elbows and a tractor air filter. if you have any ideas I would love 
to hear them
