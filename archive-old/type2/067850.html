Subject: New Post Examines Evil Nazi Blood Guilt on all VW Owner's Hands 

James Cohen posted:
&gt;We may all love VWs but we should never forget it's less than
&gt;innocent beginings.  Sometimes I'm not sure how to reconcile the 
&gt;fact that every car I own is a VW with Nazi roots, but if I was in 
&gt;Germany 50 years ago I could've been condemned to slave labor 
&gt;and made to work to death.

&gt;VWs are great, but there is blood it's hands.

Oh, puleeeeeeeeeeeese!
By keeping some nearly ancient van-type vehicles on the road, 
we're all guilty of having Evil Nazi Blood Guilt on our hands??  
Simply ludicrous!

But that's not all.  My ancestry is 1/4 German, so I am additionally 
responsible for the sinking of the Lusitania!  My Norwegian
ancestry fills me with guilt for the crimes of the Vikings.  Oh, will
my Blood Guilt never end?  

If you feel so guilty about owning &quot;VWs with Nazi roots,&quot; why 
don't you buy a Ford?  America certainly has no blood on it's
hands. ;&gt;p

 .....be on the road in no time

 '70 Westy                      So the kids they dance they shake their bones
 &quot;The Carcass&quot;           Cause its all too clear we're on our own
