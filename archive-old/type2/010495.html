Subject: VW Trailer Hitch problem???
Message-ID: &lt;19991030155726.25487.qmail_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

Hi everyone,

I own a 1976 VW westy and I need to haul a trailer behind it. I need to haul 
a bike &amp; single axle trailor which weighs approx 300 lbs total. Has anyone 
ever done this? Is it possible to buy a bolt on hitch anywhere? Or do I have 
to build my own and what should I bolt it onto?

Thanx

Matt
