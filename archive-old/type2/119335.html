&gt;You will exceed 60psi when cold.  Get the 100psi gauge if you have to choose between those two.

Thanks to all for the replies. It has a limiter but since the point is to measure I'll go with 100.

&gt;I have an 0-80psi electrical gauge and the range is just right.  Are you really going to run a hose all the way to the front?

No. It's for testing mainly.

BTW, I've got the VDO remote hose (150 752) that's 10x1 on both ends. There's actually an adapter on one end because the hose itself (240 902) is 10x1 to 1/8-27 NPT. The mechanical oil pressure gauge is 1/8-27 NPT...
