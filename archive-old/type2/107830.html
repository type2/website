Thanks everyone for your help. After speaking with Bob from VW Tech and
then Bob speaking with the seller of the car it is looking like it is
not the car for us. 
 
Bob was incredibly friendly and exceptionally helpful and would gladly
have any VW work I needed done by him (if only he were closer). Thanks
again for all of your input and help.
 
After much scouring I have found another Ghia that suits our criteria
according to the seller and am looking for someone to provide me with an
unbiased opinion on the car. This car is located in Las Vegas. Any help
would be appreciated.
 
Cheers,
