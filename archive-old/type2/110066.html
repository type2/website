Subject: Re: [T2] Muir engine sounds url - an update

Hiya Hoop,

&quot;Please don't do that. Joe pursued and obtained permission from Eve Muir to
carry those files. My understanding is that Mrs. Muir was very gracious, and
I'm sure if somebody contacted her, she would be again--but it's up to her.

--Hoop &quot;

Well, maybe not.  The widow Muir sold Muir Publishing (yes, and the &quot;Idiot 
Book&quot;) to Avalon Travel Publishing a couple of years ago.
