Subject: Colorado Listees going to Jerome, AZ

Hey listees, just want to know if any of you are in Colorado and have any
interest in caravaning to Jerome. Or who is coming from the east thru
Colorado that wants to meet up at some point? Pls P-mail me any plans you
might have.

Don't mind me, I'm just trying to get an early start on the planning. ;-)

Chris
