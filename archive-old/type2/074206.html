Courtney,

Every bus with a slider, up to and including the vanagons are prone to th=
is.
What happens is the lower track wears/gets rusty (as well as that lower
roller) and allows the door to drop.  Eventually, if no one does any
maintenance, it will do what yours did.
You may be able to adjust the position of the top roller to keep the door=
 in
track (check your Bentley), but sometimes you have to have the bottom tra=
ck
replaced/ refabbed.

re
Kelly (metwiz) in SC has done a track replacement job...

Good luck and be safe,

clark gordon
