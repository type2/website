Subject: Re: [T2] Type 4 motor, engine stand question...

My opinion is the hassle factor makes it not worth it. A 1 time builder (or once every 10 years) doesn't really warrant the trouble and cost to setup a test stand. If you need a stand often enough, why not?

FWIW my engine stand would not be suitable for a test stand - too tall. I would have to modify my stand to have an adjustable post (short to run, tall to work) or build another stand. 

I use it or loan it out at least a couple times a year for my engines or someone else's so I'm happy. 

Test running a carb engine of course is easier than an EFI engine. An EFI engine is going to involve alot of setup. 

FWIW I used to test run my Beetle engine on the ground (on wood). Started it with a socket wrench on the alternator. It was mostly for entertainment value since I could remove and install it in the car in just a bit over half an hour. Just as easy to install it and test it. 

If I was doing MODS then a test stand is WELL worth it. Port and polish, test. Disassemble, refine, assemble, run. No installs.
