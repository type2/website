hi bus is a wandering once she gets up to about 70km/hr, her 
steering also takes too long to respond.

i have beed told that is the left outer tierod and the idler i looked 
and could see nothing wrong with them. I was also told that was 
bearing at top of steering box, when steering wheel is turned, the 
top of the steering box does move a bit from side to side. is this 
indicating there is something wrong with it or just normal?

just want to know what exactly is wrong
