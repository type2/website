Subject: Re: Custom Wheels

 I recently put a set of 16&quot; wheels on my 77. They are 16&quot;x8 5x112 rims with 40mm offset. The rears are 225/50 series these are extremely wide tires but they do fit. However barely about one inch each side. On the front the 225/50 tires rub on the swaybar. I tried 205/55 and they appear to work. I still need to try 225/55 those will be closer to the stock diameter. Now I Do not want you to think that I recommend doing this. I have noticed much better handling however the steering is not designed to handle a tire this wide. They follow every little crack in the road and a well placed pothole will literally tear the steering wheel right out of your hands. My next project will be a beefier stabilizer. I hope you can use some of this info to make a more informed decision. I only tried this because I had the rims and tires.
