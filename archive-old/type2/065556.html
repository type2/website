Subject: Re: Good Experiences with RMMW

&gt;Their service is outstanding, but how come no one ever mentions their huge
&gt;mark-up? In any event, in business terms they're doing the right thing by
&gt;targeting the growing segment of affluent hobbyists. After all, old VWs
&gt;have ceased to be a poor person's means of transportation and have instead
&gt;turned into Sunday cutesies for Eddie Bauer princes and princesses ;-)
&gt;(&quot;pardon me, would you have some... Salsa?&quot;).

&lt;grin&gt;

Actually I think RMMW is brilliant and I respect them highly for what
they've accomplished. No punch line, I really mean it. They identified a
HUGE unexploited niche and did it right. They needed a car with a huge pool
of devoted owners who have a nearly constant need for parts, and they found
it with the VW--and turned it into an Inc. 500 business.

There's only one other car I can think of on the planet you could build a
similar business on, and that's the short Jeep. If I had money I'd imitate
RMMW selling Jeep parts.
