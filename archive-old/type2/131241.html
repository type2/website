Subject: Re: [T2] Engine rebuild

Your WIFE assembled it?

Where can I get one of those?!?!?!?!?! I'm happy if mine doesn't ask me to
do something else when I'm up to my elbows in engine. ;-)

I live in an apartment now and really miss my parts cleaning tank and engine
stands and such. :( The father-in-law has that stuff, but driving across
town to do work on the bus (or Volvo, or Fiero...etc) is a real PITA.

With extreme jealousy,
Don

&gt; I built mine on the front porch of my rented house on a B&amp;D Shopmate. Hurt
my hand badly (lawn mower bit me in freak accident) and my wife assembled
it. We installed it in the driveway. Great wife!
