Subject: RE: [T2] Hankook Tires are back!

Looks like the CQ was called the CS at one point?  Mine say CS but looks
exactly like the CQ on their site.  Unless there is load range difference.

I ended up going with the Nokian Hakkapeliitta CS's on my 78 and in almost
all cases I will drive it before I drive out in icey/snow weather in the
SUV.  A great tire if it can be afforded.
