Subject: Re: HELP!! Still Topless in CT (and getting desperate)

Hi there
   Thanks for the reply. I've gotten a few &quot;I thinks&quot; and  a couple of 
&quot;pretty sures&quot; and a couple of confirmations (not all on the list) that the 
sliding metal hard tops are the same for all years. It is supposed to be a 
sliding hard top (it still has the handcrank installed for some odd reason) 
The rest of the parts are long gone. 
   Thanks to everyone on the list for their support and have a Happy Holiday
