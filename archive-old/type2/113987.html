YIKES! another listee has discovered my playground!
Don't forget to go to the car shows/swap meets and pick up the free 
admission cards to the ecology yards.
I usually keep one or two in my wallet at all times.
lookin at a dozen or so sitting on my desk from the LA Car show.
At the last show the Ecology Girl gave me two as I walked by, I took them, 
went two steps and turned around.
I said something stupid like &quot;you know, two cards, just won't do.  Ecology 
is how I keep my old vehicles running.  I'm going to need a hand full of 
those things.&quot;
she looked a little surprised, smiled and just handed over a stack of a few 
dozen. :-)
