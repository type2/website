Subject: Roof rack

In a recent posting, jbrill mention a roof rack that ran 3/4 of the roof from 
back to front. If anyone one has one they are interested in selling or another 
variation of the monster called a roof rack let me know. It does not have to be
origonal. Just long. Or the kind that sits on the front would be nice too.
