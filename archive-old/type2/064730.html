well, seeing as the bus ran so bad, the first thing I did to it today
was....clean the dash.   Some DPO had a bad affinity for brown house paint,
and had brushed broen latex on the dah, part of the cab roof vent, behind
where the visors should be (missing), and all the wood panels including the
ceiling. 

So I found a bucket of water and some fine steel wool and a couple clean
rags, and proceeded to get down the original white paint.  The goal was to
take off the house paint WITHOUT damaging the original paint.   First I
soaked it all, to soften it up, rolled a fag, and chatted with a friend that
stopped by.   With much soaking, and judicious use of steel wool, the dash is
now blindingly white, except around the speaker grill, which have all this
ugly glue (epoxy?) stuck to it, with I will scrape off with my fingernails
while waiting at red lights.   I should have used a finer steelwool, as it
did leave little scratches in the paint, but I think that will polish out.
 The roof and above the windows, and the land brake lever, still have paint
on it, but the aesthetics of the cab have improved dramactically.    It took
a bit less than an hour and a half, as measured by the casette tape player.

Then I decided to attack the mechanical problem.  I adjusted the valves,
which were all off.  On side was loose, the other tight.   There weren't any
drips under the motor, and it had sat for two days.   Then I adjusted the
points and timing, which were pretty ok.    The bus then started right up.
 :)     Oil change tomorrow, and carb inspection - esp the float valve.
 That's the mini tune up.

My goal is to drive it to the bus club Wed in Seattle, so it needs to be more
roadworthy than it is.

Oh, and I named her - Nellie.     When she's all styled out she can be the
more formal Ellanore.
