I can assure you this, your problem is not that the bus has fuel injection!
It may be that the FI is not set right or that your mechanic knows so little
about FI that when he sees a bus with it, he recommends you changing it over
to carbs.  

I would make sure the air flow meter is adjusted correctly and that the
timing really is &quot;fine&quot;.  it should be 7.5 before TDC.  I would also make
sure the vaccum hoses are attached correctly especially the one that is
found right in the middle of the top of the engine.  Stick your head in
there, you will see it.

I have driven a 79 FI bus a long way over the past few years and the only
times problems occured was when a part of the system went bad, or some idiot
mechanic got his nose inside the compartment and said &quot;Man I would get rid
of this FI and get a carburator.&quot;

Don't get rid of the FI, don't get rid of the bus!  Just slow down, take a
deep one, and fix the bus.  Most of all don't fret and stress, the bus is
worth more than that to one's mind if they will let it be.
