Ok list have been thinking alot about this. I have my original westy fridge
out of my 74, it also has the stove on top with tthe burners on it. I also
have the original ice cube makers that fit on the small tray rare I think
but not sure. What I'd like to trade for is a 1. gas heater that fits in my
74 bn4? i think.
or a drive away side tent in excellent shape,or maybe an ac unit for a 74? I
also have the original orange vinyl door panels with stereo holes cut in
them but otherwise in grod shape,no tears or anything. And i replaced all my
original birch panels in the walls with new so I have the old with original
stickers and ashtray available,lets do soe trading!
