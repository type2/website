      Well, I'm not quite clear on what you're doing here, but it sounds as if
you have one of those add-on oil sumps? If that is the case, then I'd think
that the problem is that the oil is simply not circulating well enough --
although I'd think that after a long run it would still get up higher than
that. Did you possibly get gasket goo on the threads of the sender, or, heaven
forbid, on the crucial center part itself? If not, I'd think I'd try getting
another sender, and if that didn't work, assuming the deep sump to be the
problem, find another place to put it, like a oil gallery?

&gt; I have a VDO oil temp gauge installed in my bus with an oil sump temp sender

&gt; 120 F, that is it barely moves off the stop. I know that's wrong. Has anyone
&gt; had similar problems with their VDO temp senders mounted in a similar place?
