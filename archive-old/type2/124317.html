Subject: More tire questions, winter, all season vs. C/D 

Hi Volks,

All the Load range C/D tires I'm finding on http://www.tirerack_dot_com are all
&quot;summer rib&quot; so am I better off buying all season tires then buying C/D
tires in the spring??

In the search for a job I find my self in a situation where I'll be driving
150+ miles at the beginning off the week, staying with a fellow list member
(thanks Eric) and then 150+ miles at the end of each week to get home to see
my wife. At a minimum this situation will exist till at least December. .

I won't be running &quot;fully loaded&quot;, but snow/winter driving is a concern....

So what ya'll think??? Comments, experiences???

Thanx
MikeL
