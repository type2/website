&gt;&lt;&lt; I'm thinking of a weekly Friday post something like the Weakly Statz,
but
 which is nothing but a clickable list of aircooled resources. &gt;&gt;
&lt;

This resource is already available at
http://ourworld_dot_compuserve_dot_com/homepages/JJRodgers1/library/library.htm or
you can click on it directly from Type2_dot_com.   It gets appoximately 350
hits a day....someone is using it.....

Suggestions welcome,
Thanks,
