Unfortunately, You get what you pay for.  They sell motors so cheap you can
be assured they won't last.

Subject: [T2] installed bap engine wont run


&gt; just installed our new bap 1600 in our bus. went to start it and it turns
&gt; over, thre is gas going through the filter but wont start. Had a few
flames
&gt; shoot out the exhaust but that is it. When i installed the dist. they said
&gt; the engine was set at tdc#1, but the rotor was pointing about 180' away
from
&gt; the #1 mark which is at about 5-6oclock pointing directly at me should the
&gt; dist. be turned so the mark at about 12-1oclock, or is the engine not set
&gt; right. Thanks
