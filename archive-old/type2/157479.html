Subject: Re: [T2] 76 brake problems...

so whats the trick to bleeding brakes by youreself without buying the bleeder kit to do it yourself...
   
  guy on the phone told me that i could just hang a can with some wire on each tire and hook a hose to it and bleed umm that ways.....  says that longs the hose is in the can with the fluid now air can get back up.....
   
  i thought you must hold the pedal down to not let air back in no matter what....
   
  so hmmm... how can i see the bubbles or no bubbles....
   
  i am sure you can put something to hold the pedal against the seat maybe ....?
   
  and run back and lock off....????
   
  i been bleeding them with a hose and a jar..... the way i always do....
   
  he thinks my master cylinder might of went out....?
   
  hmmmm? i dont see any fluid around it either...?

  &gt; thanks i have two calls in now on answering machines for new metal lines or
&gt; used at this point.... this is one of those things i should have replaced at
&gt; the time of rubber hoses but post poned it for a later break down i
&gt; guess....
&gt;

While you're waiting, can you pull the metal lines? Or just pull off
the soft hoses and try blowing compressed air through them to see if
they're plugged?
