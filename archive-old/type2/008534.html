Hi George and all.
This isssue comes up now and again, for both the starter and the 
generator. There are several factors to choosing new, rebuilt, or OEM 
rebuilt.

The first thing you need to know is that many FLAPS carry parts that are 
rebuilt. These usually are guaranteed forever. This is good. The bad is 
that most rebuilt electrical parts like these are actually put together 
by students in electrical classes, or cheap foriegn labor. In the 
students case, they get experience and in both cases labor is cheap. 
This often results in poor quality control.
In the case of OEM rebuilt, quality control is high, but the price to 
you goes up.
In the case of new, often this actually is still a rebuild, just a OEM 
rebuil labeled as a new part, and they rightfully can call the part that 
because most of the insides are replaced anyway.
