Subject: Down, Idle, down! (2.0L FI)

So, why can't I adjust my idle any lower. (My adjust screw is tightened 
all the way.) 

I've recently taken out the engine, installed electronic ignition 
(optically triggered), and played with the CO screw to get it to pass 
emissions. 

What could cause the symptom? Vacuum leak?
