&gt;also don't forget some high-temp grease (or other similar item of

To the original poster:

If you choose not to use engine oil as a lubricant/sealer, I believe 914 folks use &quot;Dow Corning 111 Valve Lubricant and Sealant&quot;.  The seals will be very hard to install dry.

A couple of months back Dr. Tim said not to use any kind of permanent sealant on the push rod tube o-rings as they have to move without binding due to heat expansion.
