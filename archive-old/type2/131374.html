Subject: More Westy Seating

}}Hi Folks,

}}I know it's a little late for this thread, but I had a different but 
related
}}question.

}}I have a '79 Westy, and I have removed the sink cabinet.  I like the 
larger
}}amount of space, and I can get by without running water and a sink when 
I'm
}}camping.  I still have the icebox cabinet and Z-bed, but was thinking 
about
}}increasing the seating capacity when I'm not camping or hauling.

Jason, Jason, Jason.....

The PERFECT answer [OK, not 'perfect', but pretty good] is to install two 
rear facing jump seats from a '87 Vanagon Carat.

They just fit into their brackets, and come with attached seat belts.

You can flip the seat bottoms straight up when no one is sitting in them, or 
take them out completely with a simple hand movement.

There are two holes needed  in the floor that must be made in the Westy so 
the Carat seat can fit into them.

And there is a bracket that is permanenty attached to the back of the 
passenger and driver seat that forms the other points of attachment.

The seat belts come on and off with the seats, but I said that already.

Probably not cheap, and pretty rare.

Does anyone have any pictures of these beauties??
