Subject: RE: [T2] Been thinking of moving myself

I live just east of Asheville.  There has been one occasion where a
hurricane did reach pretty far in. Think it got as far as Greensboro,NC.
There has never been one that has reached Asheville though.  Let me know
if you wanna look around.  Come and down and camp at our place and we'll
show you a quick tour on the weekend.

I'm thinking mountains, Asheville perhaps. Do they get hurricanes there?
I
don't really need to go through one of those.
BTW have you looked outside? It's snowing again. (sigh)

&gt; During my 20 years of active duty military, 4 USMC and 16 Army, I was
&gt; stationed and had temporary duty in a lot of places in the U.S. and
abroad
&gt; including Camp Lejeune, NC and Fort Jackson, SC and when I retired I
chose
&gt; the state you are in, Minnesota.  At least we don't have to worry
about
&gt; hurricanes!  I was through two of those in SC.  BTW, I'm originally
from
&gt; Indiana.

&gt; &gt;  Minnesota, the buses are rusty and the weather's lousy!
