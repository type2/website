Subject: LPG conversions

Dear All,
	My '70 bus fuel bills are a joke. I really want 
to build a VW LPG engine. Most info found is a bit vague 
or companies wanting to sell £2k installations. Can 
anyone provide me with as much detailed, recent info on 
DIY LPG issues such like good equipment and necessary 
engine mods. I'm very interested in how Bob Hoover got on
after reading his threads from back in '97. Any info back
to j.z.klepacki_at_staffs.ac_dot_uk

Regards jools.
