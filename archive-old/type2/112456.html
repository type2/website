Subject: New AC Twist

Well I was parusing a Farm oriented news release the other day, and came
upon an ad--which stated this--

Maxi Fridge--Natural Organic Refrigerant

Replaces HF 134A and other CFC 12 substitutes

Drop in Replacement

No retrofit necessary
No Oi Change Needed
No license required
Will not damage the compressor
$1.99 per can--

And here is the kicker---one can--replaces a pound of R-12--
I have no idea how big the cans are--bt they for sure are smaller than a
pound.

This stuff allegidly expands to fill the AC lines--

I called the 800 number, and talked to the guy who is selling the
stuff--
It supposidly blows colder than 12--with half the volume, and is
compatible with PAG, Ester, as well as Mineral oil.

This sounds like another miracle in a can--and the only draw back--is
that the minimum order is $100.00 bucks--like a case of the stuff.

I'm intreguied--interested--but if it don't work--I'd hate to be stuck
with the remnants of a case of it--

The guys phone number is;

1 800 256-6033--you can quiz him---I asked about operating pressure's,
seal leakage--ad verthing else I could possibly think of--but he said it
was all good to go--   
You give it a shot and see what you can come up with--I give.

Oh yea--

Web Page address is--
www.maxifrig_dot_com
Check it out, and see what you come up with--it does sound
intereting--but I'm from Missouri--show me--:&gt;)


Later,
