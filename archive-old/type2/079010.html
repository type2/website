Subject: Re: [T2] Working Fuel Injectors, gaskets and manifolds


&gt;Anyways, is there a gasket between the intake
&gt;manifolds (where the injectors squirt into before it
&gt;enters the head) and the haed?


Yes

&gt;Do I have to remove
&gt;any cooling tin to take loose this intake manifold?


No

&gt;There is dry backfires coming from this area and the
&gt;stinking thing will not idle.  Also, there is smoke
&gt;rising from this area as well.

EGR checks. Vacuum leaks everywhere.

&gt;Also, there is a pretty good leak out of the drivers
&gt;side, just above the heater box.  I am thinking, valve
&gt;cover gasket????  How hard is that to replace?  remove
&gt;the heater box and exhaust and take the valve cover
&gt;off and will it come off?

No - just pop the valvecover off.

Congrats!!!
