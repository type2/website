Subject: RE: [VB] repair reservoir

&gt; If there is one thing on a vehicle that I don't experiment with, it's
&gt; the brake system. I might experiment w/repairing the reservoir, but
&gt; wouldn't dream of actually relying on it to save my life.
&gt;
&gt; Call me alarmist, but I've had too many close calls... Anybody remember
&gt; my Jerome adventure last year??


Ok youre an alarmist. Its a 68 (one year) upper reservoir.\
I probably wouldnt do it on a lower reservoir either.but in this case its
not as critical.
