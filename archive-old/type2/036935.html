***disclaimer*** my responses here are based on my experiences with one of 
my other cars, an 81 mercedes 240D with 300k mi on the clock, so there may 
be differences, but so far as i know bearing and ball joint issues are 
pretty much universal



&gt;1.  I have a moaning in my front end which is loud enough for me to rename
&gt;Klunk to &quot;The Blue Wookie&quot;.  At first I thought it may be a brake cylinder
&gt;locking up but now I am starting to think that all I need is a simple
&gt;bearing job. I did the rock-the-tire test and it is obvious they need to be
&gt;repacked, maybe even replaced. Could bad bearings cause a moan? It is most
&gt;noticeable at low speeds and while turning.  I also need to replace a 
&gt;couple
&gt;of ball joints, but I don't think they could cause a constant moan like I 
&gt;am
&gt;getting.
&gt;

id suspect the bearing. my benz has the same problem. i noticed it first 
halfway between home (ft meade, just outside of baltimore) and pine grove 
PA...120 or so mile trip...it started off as a moan but got louder and 
louder. i repacked it at pine grove and it quieted considerably, but theres 
still some noise. im just gonna replace it when i replace my brakes.

&gt;
&gt;6.  As I stated before I need to replace some ball joints (3 to be exact). 
&gt;I
&gt;also need an alignment. Which one should I do first, or does it matter?
&gt;

id do your joints first. after you monkey with your front suspension like 
that, youre gonna need an alignment anyway
