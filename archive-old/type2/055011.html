Subject: clutch chatter/new to buffalo area

hi, 
the first time i take off in my bus every morning my clutch seems to chatter 
a little bit.  after the second or third time i start out in first gear, the 
problem goes away for the rest of the day until the next morning.  ive had 
this problem for a while and have decided to just deal with it for now.  has 
anyone here had this problem?  could it be a small amount of tranny oil 
somehow getting into the bell housing and onto my clutch plate and the 
chatter is just the oil burning off?  also i just moved from pa to the 
buffalo, ny area and i am checking to see if there is anyone else on this 
list in the around here.  thanks!!
