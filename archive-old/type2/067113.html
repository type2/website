&gt;But it wasn't a VW, I don't think, but looked very much like a bay-window.
&gt;Anyone know any more?  Might be an interesting conversation piece.

I dunno about Chinese vans, but when I was in the Caribbean a 
few years back I noticed quite a few of those Daihatsu vans
(Japanese, not chinese, I know...) But anyway, they looked 
eggzactly like a shrunken-up Vanagon.  Seated seven relatively
friendly folks, about as long (outside) as a Honda Civic. They
were almost as cool as the little British Mokes seen everywhere
.  I wanted to bring one of 'em home!!!
