Subject: Re: [T2] ETKA CD &amp; praise for thebusco_dot_com

&gt; Quite some time ago I purchased one of those ETKA
&gt; CD's that was floating around everyone's favorite
&gt; auction site and I've been trying to get it to
&gt; run properly under Windows XP, but nothing seems
&gt; to work. Does anyone have any idea on how to
&gt; make this work?

I have the same problem with my ETKA Cdrom. I have the
1998 edition. It has to do with the crack I think.
Mine works fine under Win95 and Win98, but it refuses
to work under the other, newer, windows versions. Then
it says you don't have a licence to use it.
