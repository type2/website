Subject: Which 30/31-PICT Carb to buy?

Hi folks.  Got my 1600SP back from the mech and per his 
recommendation I'm going to replace the incorrect 28-PICT carb on 
it (with the optional extra sloppy bushings and bad accel pump) 
with a more correct 30mm venturi model.

Bus Depot seems to have the best price ($140) for a &quot;31-PICT-3, 
1500-1600cc (63-70 bus, 66-70 Beetle/Ghia) 113 129 029H&quot; model, 
but I've also seen several ads in the mags for a &quot;30-PICT Carb&quot; for 
$90-$100 (So Cal Imports et al).  I don't see this carb in either the 
Bus Depot's site or in RMMW's paper catalog.

Anyone have any recent experience that would shed light on the 
cheaper carb?  Made by aborigines from scrap tin?  What works?  I 
guess if I can't find out anything more about this cheaper one I'll 
buy from Ron, but at 60% of the higher priced carb, this &quot;30-PICT 
Carb&quot; sounds like a much better deal.

thanks,
Joe
