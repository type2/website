&lt;&lt;&gt;My mechanic is telling me that GEX is bad news in general &gt;&gt;

I have my own horror stories regarding GEX.  It's all in the archives, and I
won't repeat it here.

I bought the engine before I was on this list and I knew better.  I think
there are several better rebuilders out there.  You may pay a few more bucks,
but you are far better off with someone else.

On the other hand, how is your engine setup with carburation?  Are you running
the original setup with the stock dizzy?  If you have repeated head failure,
it's possible that you are running too lean, or have other problems.  Are you
using any oil temp. or oil pressure gauges?  

Make sure that your check everything out after you fix your problems to make
sure they won't return.  If you're not running the oil pressure and oil temp
gauges, make sure you install these.  Check your spark plugs and tail pipe for
signs of a lean mixture.  

Hope this helps.
