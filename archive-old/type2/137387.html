Subject: On the subject of heat ...

So how many CFM does the stock bay squirrel cage pump out ? I have two 
bilge blowers that push 105 and 150 CFM, that sure seems like more than 
the stock blower ever pushed, I am now debating a 250cfm flexmount 
blower, as things get colder and I get more and more interested in 
warmth/recirculation (or is that circulation in my feet)

BUT my real interest is just how much air does the stock blower fan in 
a bay move ? Did this improve in later years vs early years ?
My 73 squirrel cage does move a fair swack of air, but it seems nowhere 
near what my bilge blowers move, each on their own.

Thoughts ?
Steve
