&gt;  How would I tell, from my VIN number, what type of BUS I have?

The general theory on the breadloaf busses is as follows:

The first three digits tell you what you have and when it was built.  The
first digit is a 1, 2, 3, or 4 and means the following:

1 - you own a beetle
2 - you own a van (and you wondered why we called it the type 2 list :-)
3 - you own a squareback, fastback or notchback
4 - you are always in the market for separate headlights :-) err... really
    you own a type4.. they resemble type3's but have separate headlamps
 
the second digit tells you what body style...  For busses it goes:

1 - Panel Truck
2 - Station Wagon
3 - Kombi or Campmobile (Westfalia)
6 - Pickup Truck

The third digit tells you the year of manufacture.  

1 - 1971
2 - 1972
3 - 1973
4 - 1974
5 - 1975
6 - 1976
7 - 1977
8 - 1968 *or* 1978
9 - 1969 *or* 1979
0 - 1970

The 1968/78 and 1969/79 can be distinguished by the bumpers.  if they are
square, it's a '70s model.

Thus if the VIN starts 222 then it is a bus, station wagon, 1972.  A 237
is a bus, Westfalia, 1977.

Because I can never end a post like this without a question, I notice
theat the sub-types 4 and 5 were not used.  Is this true?  If not what did
they signify?  Just because we never saw them in the US does not mean they
were not used!

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
