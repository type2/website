Subject: I need a front beam

Hello, I'm in need of a good front beam for my 76 Westy.
I'd like it some place relatively close (3-4 hours) to me in NW PA so I could
pick it up. I live in Erie, PA.
I don't know if something like that is shippable, but as a last resort I would
pay for shipping.

I just bought the bus about a month ago, so I blew most of my cash on that.
The cost for putting it in, plus brakes, some engine work is hitting hard too.
I'm not asking for a freebie, but please, be gentle:)

I would like it ASAP as my bus has been at the mechanics for almost 2 weeks- I
want it back!!

Thanks a million,

Nik Bajorek
