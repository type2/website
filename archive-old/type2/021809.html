Subject: Re: [T2] hydraulic valve adjustment

WHY did you gap them?  Was the purpose to hammer the seats or
something??  I curious about that...

&gt; The first round of hydraulic valve adjustments on the rebuilt engine were as
&gt; per Bentley.  After a 100 miles or so I readjusted them again as per Bentley.
&gt; 
&gt; After reading Bob Donalds information on hydraulic lifters I decide I would
&gt; give it a try.  I reset them a couple of days ago with the engine cold to
&gt; .006 ths and have run it for a few days around town and on the highway.
&gt; 
&gt; Should my next (and hopefully final) valve adjustment be on a cold or warm
&gt; engine?
&gt; Should I now use the 1/4 to 1/2 turn in after contact with valve setting or
&gt; should I use Bentley's 2 full turns in?
