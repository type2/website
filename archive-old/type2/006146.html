Hi Volks,   This past weekend my nephew and I pulled and dismantled the
engine from his 76 Type II with the original 2000cc.  There is no doubt that
it will have to be rebuilt.  A plan has come to mind that I want to get your
opinion about.  I have a 78 Bus with a complete engine that I will lend him
for the 76 if you can tell me it will be a straight swap.  The 78 is dead in
the water with many problems other than the engine.  I know that the 78 has
hydraulic lifters as a difference. Any thing else?  Can we use the FI with
the same connectors, same brain etc?  The 76 is set up for transporting Tave
(my Nephew) and his Shifter Cart to races so we would like to get it up and
running and have time to rebuild his T-IV engine and not be in a hurry. TIA
