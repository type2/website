Well, nearly ten years after having to give up my '63 barndoor (gulp), I've
gotten back into the swing of things, and picked up a '69 Westy. Didn't know
it was a Westy when I drove from Boston to just outside Philly to pick it
up. Had a hunch when I saw the AC outlet on the driver's side, but still
wasn't sure. Why not, you may ask?

The only remaining pieces of evidence of its Westy background are the
seat/bed (which still has the Westfalia badge on it), the hardwood
headliner, and the AC outlet. Otherwise, everything else has been removed.
So, I'm in the process of trying to find sources for the cabinetry.

The steering wheel had also been replaced with a wooden wheel that resembles
something out of a clown car, and the headliner from above the back of the
front seats to the rear had been covered with a brown tiger-stripe velour.
Very attractive (not!). The PO had actually taken real good care of &quot;Suegro&quot;
as my wife has named him (the Westy, not the PO), and the engine is a decent
running 1600cc with a slight backfire that I think is due to the exhaust.

Now that I've given way more information than most would want, to my query:
I want desperately to put the steering situation back to rights. Does anyone
have any leads on a tiller for Suegro? I'm relatively new to Boston (2
years) so I've not gotten familiar with any wrecking or parts yards. Any
help from fellow listers would be GREATLY appreciated. Thanks!
