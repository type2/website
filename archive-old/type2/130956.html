Subject: im back, oil leaks, fires,  phish, and trades???

Listees,

Sorry I was gone so long, I guess I just needed a break from the Type2 list 
and I have missed reading about what everyone is doing.

First, I may be trading my 82 Westy for a 71 Westy. My 82 Westy leaks alot 
of oil coming from the oil cooler seal. Somehow it gets on the manifold or 
something and it smokes. Is this a fire hazard?

2nd, is anyone going to see Phish at Deek Creek?

Also, if my trade with the 71 Westy falls through would anyone like to trade 
a bay window bus for my 82?

Here it is:

Basically, I'd love to find an early bay with a type1 engine, but I'll 
consider other bays. Looking for something with no major mechanical problems 
and is a driver. Doesn't have to be a camper.

TIA!!!
