&gt; &gt; just heard on the news that the Crazy Rays in Jessup has burned
&gt; &gt; extensively today.  arial photos do not show how much damage, it was still
&gt; &gt; on fire flames shooting high into the air
&gt;
&gt; This Crazy Ray's?
&gt; http://www.crazyraysautoparts_dot_com/

there are two of them. the one on Washington Blvd in Jessup is the one
that burned.  Barry was out there not too long ago and said there were a
few buses but he doesn't keep stuff around very long, maybe a month and
what's left gets crushed.

the one on Erdman Ave always seems to have one or two buses in varying
stages of disassembly every time I've been there

&gt; Hope the fire misses the buses...

kinda hard to tell from the news copter film that I saw
