&gt; Problem: '78 C.E. Westy, ~1600 miles on rebuild. New condenser.

&gt; oil on the points pivot. Timing is 50 degrees dwell, .016&quot; gap, and
&gt; 8.5 BTDC.
&gt; All's about how it should be. Goes through a set of points in about
&gt; 500 miles.

&gt; I'm thinking the coil may be on it's last legs?
&gt; 
&gt; I've checked for voltage across the points while everything is
&gt; off.... and
&gt; nothing.

I'd suspect the condenser first, even if it is new.  The condenser is
there to protect the points by preventing excessive arcing.  If the
condenser is bad, the points will go fast.

It might also be the coil, but then you would probably also have
running problems.

Best advice is to replace points, condenser and coil.  If the problem
goes away you can narrow it to the specific component, if it's worth
your while.
