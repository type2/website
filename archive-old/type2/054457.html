Greetings!

I am interested in purchasing a VW Bus here in my local area (Akron, OH). I was collecting all the information that I could, and I was just curious about MPG to expect from a bus. One that I am seriously considering is a 1973 with of course a 1700cc engine. Does anyone know what to expect?

Thank you,
