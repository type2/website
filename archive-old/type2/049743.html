Subject: Re: [T2] Rolling backwards with your bus

Alistair Cullum sends:

&gt; Remember that the forward &quot;thrust&quot; of an automatic with your foot off the
&gt; gas is only as much as is provided by the idling engine, minus the loss in
&gt; the torque converter.  On a sufficiently steep hill, an automatic will drift
&gt; backwards when you take your foot off the brake, until you give it enough
&gt; throttle to counter gravity's pull.  No danger of stalling out, of course,
&gt; but you do need to make the brake-to-throttle transition fairly quickly or
&gt; use the handbrake to avoid rolling.

Brake to throttle transition? Apparently I didn't communicate this technique
properly.

Put your left foot on the brake pedal and right on the gas. At the same
time. 

We use the handbrake in manual-transmission cars because they have more
pedals than we have feet; if you have two pedals and two feet like auto-
transmission cars do, you don't need the handbrake.
