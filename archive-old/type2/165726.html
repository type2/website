Subject: Re: [T2] exhaust header gaskets

I have been known to put a small touch of gasket sealent on there just to push them up in there and get them right and then carefully put the heater boxes on from there..
  chai
  black blue red it's just whatever i got.. its not for sealing just tacking up long enough to let me torque it down and stay in right place..

what will &quot;REALLY&quot; hold those things in place. I've seriously considered

thanks
