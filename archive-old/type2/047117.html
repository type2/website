Hold on a minute! I asked a simple question figuring the good folks on
the list could give me a quick reply. Ken Hooper's reply clocked in  at
one minute.  Yes, I could have looked it up but looked at the thread
that spun.  It was a lot more that I would have gotten from a text.
Lighten up folks and  thanks for the numerous civil replies.
