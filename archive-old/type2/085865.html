Subject: Seattle-Area Offer - NOS ATE Calipers for 73-up Bus

I have a pair of NOS calipers that I purchased for my 71 Bus.  =
Unfortunately they are not what the seller represented, and rather than =
go through the hassle of shipping them back I thought I'd offer them to =
folks in the Seattle area.  These are brand new, old stock.  A little =
dirty but in fine condition.  I will sell them for what I paid ($160) or =
will trade them for a set of remanufactured 71 Bus Calipers.

Any takers?  You must come get them as I have no vehicle right now. =
