&gt;I doubt it will unscrew. 

you don't have to pull the engine, but pull off the heater box and get the van
on a good set of jackstands for more room if you like.
Try anyway.  Spray spray spray wd-40 periodically from now until the stud is
removed. A carefully used propane torch will also help, but it might not be a
good idea in your case. if you use it, be careful not to point it at a fuel
line or any rubber, especially the pushrod tube gaskets. 

My routine is this:
1) spray with Wd (goggles on)
2) heat with torch
3) clamp medium to large vice grip on the stud
4) work it like it worked you
5) spray more heat  every so often I try to move the vice grip - rock it
gently like a car in snow.  etc. this scenario is grim, but not as bad as
watching from behind the insurance rope as someone walks under your raised bus
with an torch and trys cutting it out while you watch, sparks flying
everywhere.

&gt; So if I have to drill it do I need to re-tap the hole for a new stud? What
size tap? 

Yes,  probably.  I'm not sure of the tap size you might want to compare the
stud you get to the old one before you tap. the proper stud probably allows
you to tap the hole slightly,  because the boss that hole sits on is not too
big.

&gt;Where to get it? 

I bought some from Unimetric Industries of Hackensack New Jersey, but they may
be gone now. More recently I bought some american type of bolts from Warwick
Industrial Fasteners (401) 739-9200.

&gt;What size stud? 

I can't remember the numbers for the stud but here's a way to remember it. Its
the exact same length as the white paper part of a Camel Filter Hard Pack
cigarette. It's small end has a diameter equal to the same cigarette (stud
threads included) and it's bigger 'head' end equal diameter of same cigarette
(stud threads not included). now this is probably the version for after you
tap the hole as I think the stock vw version of the bolt had a less big big-
end. Make sense? I hope.
