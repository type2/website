Pete:

Having a friend who will help you with mechanical work is one of the
most incredibly useful &quot;tools&quot; you can have!  Everybody should have
at least one!

Anyway, to your problem.

If the studs are just slightly off from the holes they slide into it's
almost impossible for normal humans to push those manifolds back on.

So, hold the manifold in place such that 2 of the studs are lined up
with their respective holes, but don't insert them significantly into
the holes or you'll get the manifold &quot;cocked&quot; such that the remaining 2
studs _really_ don't line up with their holes.  What you want is 2 of the
studs just _barely_ into their holes and the other 2 studs pointing 
at the remaining holes; these last 2 studs won't point directly down the
center of their holes (otherwise, you'd just push the manifold right into
place!) but, hopefully, they'll be just a little &quot;off&quot;.  

Then (while your friend holds things in place, reach up with a rod of some
sort (I use a 5&quot; or 6&quot; piece of 3/8&quot; waterpipe) and place one end on the
manifold right on one of the &quot;off&quot; holes.  Then tap, tap, tap the other 
end of the rod (gently) with a hammer.  Give first one &quot;off&quot; hole a few
taps, then switch to the other &quot;off&quot; hole and give it a few taps.  Work
back and forth until you get both studs started.  One all studs are started
you can use the pipe and hammer an all the holes to gently tap the manifold
into place.

&gt; Now the PROBLEM:  I can't get the heat exchanger box things (with the
&gt; muffler attached) back on the engine.  The holes WILL NOT line up with
&gt; the studs poking down.  It is driving me CRAZY.  I am trying again
&gt; tomorrow morning (with reinforcements, I did the rest on my own today)
&gt; but. . . if any of you have suggestions they will be very much
&gt; appreciated.
