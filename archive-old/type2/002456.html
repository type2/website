Scott you had a few Q's,

&gt;First off, the fridge is an Electrolux and is electric, not &gt;Gas. The one
on the type 2 library page said that they &gt;are Gas. Mine says 12v and has no
gas inputs. It does &gt;have two wires going to it though. One is a German
&gt;shore power type plug, and the other looks like a German &gt;cigarette lighter
plug. There is also a push/pull switch on &gt;the side of the cabinet that does
something to the fridge.

You can get 12v 120-240v fridges, in fact any combination of 12/240v &amp; gas.
I have one with all three, but the 240v is the best even makes ice in the
ice box! You will want to confirm the voltage of this fridge &amp; use a
transformer to reduce your high voltage to 12v.

Second is the stove. It is propane. It runs off of some kind of small
refillable type bottle, however, I do not have those bottles. Inside the
cabinet under the sink is two leather straps, these must have held the
bottles.  The PO converted it to run off the Coleman throwaway bottles. But
I can not figure out the control valves. If you push it in, it seems like it
should make the igniters spark, but it does not. Then it only flows gas if
you push in and hold the knob in. How is this thing supposed to work? There
was also a vent under the sink in the floor, this is where the propane
bottles were, what is it for? Was it vust to vent off any propane leaks?

Most run off 'Calor' or 'Camping-Gaz' this is a mix of propane &amp; LPG. They
come in 3 or 4 sizes &amp; have a quick realese connection. As to the knobs you
should also see a thin probe pointing into or very near the burner, this is
a safety cut-off if the burner was to blow out. To light the burner, push it
in &amp; turn to the max mark. Light with match, piezo wand etc. whilst holding
the knob in, wait 10(ish) seconds &amp; let go the flame should stay lit.
Yes the vent is to let any escaped gas out (it is heavier than air). Always
be safe with gas as propane etc expands by 400 times when it mixes with air!
