&gt;Thanks everybody for the info on my mystery engine. Now, I have another
&gt;question. Did the 914 engine cases have the VW stamp on the bottom of them?

Yes, a VW style number rather than a Porsche style number.

&gt;I'm trying to figure what distributor to use on this thing. It has  one
&gt;ending with 009.

I'm not sure a 914 stock distributor makes sense for a bus with the same 1.7L engine. I think the bus recommendation makes more sense:

Also, general list wisdom is that the 009 isn't ideal for the bus.

&gt;Where would I look to ID the heads?

Behind the valve cover, look under the rocker arms for the number.
