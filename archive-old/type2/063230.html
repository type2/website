&gt; Or so we thought. Now we're not so sure it's a 71.
&gt;... 
&gt; Thing is, we just noticed a Westphalia sticker on a cabinet (previuously covered 
&gt; by old carpeting) that says Campmobile 70.

Biggest clue is whether it has front disk brakes or not.  Disks brakes = '71.
(Please correct me, anyone, if I'm wrong about this).

Could it be possible you have a different interior that what it 
originally came with?  Seems far-fetched to me....  Perhaps westfalia was 
using old '70 westy interiors early in the '71 bus production?  Dunno.
