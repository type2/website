&gt;What year is that?  My '71 doesn't look like that at all, no little box.
&gt;It just has two terminals marked &quot;+&quot; and &quot;G&quot; with &quot;12V&quot; stamped
&gt;between the terminals

That picture is from my 1973 bus, but I'm not 100% sure the gauge cluster is original.  Could be a '74 cluster as I parted out a '74 bus once and may have swapped the cluster at some point over the years.  I suspected that not all year busses had that box from my junkyard explorations, but I know that many did have them because I bought a couple extras.  Back when my gauge used to go to zero when I got down to half a tank, I swapped out every part but the sender hoping to fix it.  All for naught, the sender ended up being bad.  I think that box may have started with the introduction of the type4 engine (1972) but that's only a guess.

This sounds like a job for... &lt;drum roll&gt;... KARL!  :)
