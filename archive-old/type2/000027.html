Subject: Rear of bus sags (Old thread)
Message-ID: &lt;0.314bd5a2.253d2167_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I pulled my engine and noticed that without the engine the sag is totally 
gone.  As I suspected, the sag is designed to offset passenger load so you 
don't go down the road with the front drooping, although, since you would be 
going downhill it might increase gas mileage.
