Subject: Re: [T2] Type2 Gas Mileage

i all the T2's i have owned, they have all gotten around 20 mpg on the 
highway. in my experience the biggest factor in fuel economy on the 
highway was how fast i was driving. if i keep it under 60 mph it gets 
much better milage.

as far as the environmental factors that some folks are discussing - i 
totally agree with the fact that unless you are carpooling or riding a 
bike to work everyday then you don't  have enough reason to complain. - 
how about these new kits for diesel engines that run on used fryer 
grease? i saw something on TV that was showing some folks who put that 
kit on their RV &amp; are driving cross-country. they stop at fast food 
restaurants to refuel.

it doesn't burn fossil fuels &amp; talk about saving some gas money!

i do not know about emissions with this setup.

YMMV,
