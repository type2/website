BONUS POINTS to Bob.

With the WR1 (or equivalent) in place you can use a #14 or even #16 wire to
a tiny microswitch (N/O pushbutton) so small you won't even know it's there
as your &quot;remote start&quot; switch.

You could even just use a small &quot;push pin&quot; type terminal block mounted out
of sight and keep the switch in the glove box. Just plug it in and push the
button when you need it. Mount the terminal block out of sight and no-one
knows it's there. And if they see it they're not tempted to push the button
as they say &quot;Hey! What's this button do?&quot;.

the switch/wire only has to pass the current of the small relay coil.
Generally less than 2 amps. Heck, even #18 wire should be good for that.
