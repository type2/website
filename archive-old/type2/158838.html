&gt;&gt;Anyone seen any Splittie Deluxes for sale recently...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I'm thinking I'd like to eventually work towards one of those.
&gt;&gt;I like the looks of the split windshield and those skylights.  Wondering
&gt;&gt;about prices.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I've often wondered if those skylights (standee windows) could be put in a
&gt; bay....

I've thought about adding similar features to my '80 Vanagon but don't 
think it would work very well.

...a bay is close enough it might.
