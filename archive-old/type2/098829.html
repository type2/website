&gt; Classified the address as Junk mail immediately.  Is it possible for the
&gt; list administrator to do the same with postings from identified spammers?

The list does not accept messages from identified spammers.  The messages
you are receiving may or may not be sourced from a list subscriber.  I've
yet to see a complete header from one of these messages, so I've not been
able to track it down.

If someone is able to send a complete header from these emails I can do
more research.
