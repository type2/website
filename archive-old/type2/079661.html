Subject: 81 Diesel Rabbit

I had one of these a number of years ago and I'd have to say that it =
probably was the finest vehicle I ever had.  When I sold it for $500 =
(the buyer came at 11 at night gave me cash and drove off in it without =
even checking it out first!) it had 275,000 miles, absolutely NO rust =
whatsoever, and still had the original exhaust.  The only thing I ever =
did to the car was to religiously change the oil every 3000 miles =
(synthetic oil only the entire life of the car), and change the timing =
belt every 75K miles.  To the end the car continued to get 45MPG.

A few things about this car:
Its underpowered, so when driving in hilly country you have to think =
ahead -- just like with a bus -- in order to maintain speed up hills =
etc.

When you are starting it you should always turn the key to the first =
click and wait for the glow plug light to go out before trying to start =
it. =20

If you live in an area where it gets very cold (sub-freezing temps) get =
a block heater -- you and the car will be much happier. =20

I used an anti-gelling fuel additive in the winter months to help keep =
the fuel liquid so that I could start it in the morning (Montana, temps =
down to -50F brrrr!).

Good luck
