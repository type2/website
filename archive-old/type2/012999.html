Both are charged at the same time, yes, but only when the batteries are
connected by the manual switch.

In reality, when connected, current from the stronger battery will begin
flowing to the weaker one to &quot;equalize&quot; the pair, whlie at the same time
current will be delivered from the spinning alternator.

The higher voltage will always command current flow and the alternator voltage
will be supreme to either battery in the hook-up.

WARNING: Batteries are dangerous things, which can explode violently if
overcharged (overheated). Explosive Hydrogen gas is generated and vented in
the overcharge or too-fast charge state.

The inexpensive voltage regulator inside most alternators is sufficient
to prevent overcharging, but just as battery health and longeivity is linked
to how deeply discharged a battery is allowed to go, so too is it connected
to how *much* charge is forced into it.

For the above reasons, the best battery management comes from more sophisticated
monitoring and control of battery state.

Battery technology is maturing wonderfully, driven by consumer thirst
for Uninterruptible Power Supplies, laptops, electric bikes &amp; scooters,
and the new breed of hybrid cars. Solar charging systems are far superior to
present automotive charge/discharge regulation, with price tags to match.

I strongly suggest that *any* auxiliary battery installation include a way to
at least monitor--if not control--aux battery voltage in tenths of volts. I
also suggest those running generators consider converting to alternators if
restoration authenticity is not an issue.

Proper battery management is known to extend the life of even deep-cycle batteries.

Please ignore the advert beneath my sig. I don't put it there--the service does.
