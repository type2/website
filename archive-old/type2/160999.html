&gt;If it's the Mark Stephens in Palmdale, Tehachapi, etc. California, I think
&gt;he's out of business.

Closed around year 2000. Three employees and some machinery we're bought by a company called West Coast Core:

ebay seller: jjmoneyhogg

All I could find in a websearch a while back were some bad reviews:

&gt;He was a builder of type IV heads that seemed to
&gt;have a pretty good reputation, although he sold me a type 1 longblock that
&gt;was little better than a GEX.

His reputation slid at the end, he closed down the business and disappeared after apparently ripping off several people.

Just search the archives for Mark Stephens (www.markstephenshp_dot_com)
