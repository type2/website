&gt; Would that grey for the tank be the same as the grey of the fuel

&gt; manifold tubes that go to the plenunm?

&gt; And I think I have seen some engine top access hatches that color   
&gt; too.
&gt;
&gt; Is that Dove Grey maybe?

L249 Dove Grey was used for:

- the intake runners
- the tops of the belly pans
- fresh air flaps
- firewall
- fuel filler pipe
- battery clamp
- engine access hatch
- the heater boxes and muffler
- I've even seen a non-locking gas cap in this color.

&gt; Or am I crazy?

I'm not sure about the exact color since my own tank was repainted  
white after it rusted.
