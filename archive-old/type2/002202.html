Regards,

I have a sincere
&gt;&gt; question that I would like you older dudes and dudettes to take a stab
at.
&gt;&gt; Back before '72 (or was it '75) the speed limit was 70 mph, 65 mph at
night,
&gt;&gt; 65 trucks.  As far as the speed limit goes, it seems as though we have
the
&gt;&gt; same situation today as we did back then.  What I want to ask is, &quot;What
is
&gt;&gt; different about people back then as compared to today's folks?  Why is it
that
&gt;&gt; when I am tooling down the road at 50 - 55 mph I encounter more than my
share
&gt;&gt; of impatience?  Was it the same back then?&quot;   I'm 38 and don't remember
much
&gt;&gt; about driving habits of motorists back then and therefore can't compare.
Back
&gt;&gt; then there were bookoos of busses and they all apparently lived happily
with
&gt;&gt; Mopar stuff and the like.  Same speed differential between vehicles as
today.
&gt;&gt; What is different? Anyone?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Paul
