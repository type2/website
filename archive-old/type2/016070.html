Subject: Stats on 1971 bus
Date: Tue, 2 Feb 1999 14:01:11 -0800 
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Can someone give me stats on the 1971 bus?  A raving tranny thread is going
on the vintagebus list and I need to reload my ammunition :)   Facts work
better than fudge when it comes to battle.

Bus:  Aug `65 to Aug `67 (standard 1500)
hp:    53 hp _at_ 3900 rpm
top speed:      65 mph _at_4040 rpm

Can someone provide the same info for a &quot;basic 1971 bus&quot; (not camper or
otherwise).  Also the weight of the bus empty and fully loaded would be of
use.

Thanks,

  Stephen Gutknecht
