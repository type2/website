Subject: [T2] Re: Murder Investigation - Kristin Ann Laurite

Charlie Ford spoke to Kristin Laurite's family on the phone today.

While several people on the lists/ng have spoken of sending
flowers/remembrances, and of course we want to do that for the very best
reasons, the family are not receptive to hearing from strangers over
this awful event.

That is understandable given the horror of Kristin's murder, the
national publicity that is happening now and the fact that we are
complete strangers to them. We can greive for her in private without
upsetting the family further.

Again, if you have ANY useful information on the killing of Kristin
Laurite please call Officer Cleve Keeling at (501) 354-2411.
