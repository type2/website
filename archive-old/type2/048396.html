&gt; Hi, I'm new to this group, I have always had a VW but it's been a Baja
&gt; or a Bug, I now have a 70 Transporter with a bad sunroof. The cranking
&gt; mechanism was so bad an rusted that it came out in one piece, I would
&gt; also like to kind of make it into a camper, any suggestions?

A junkyard in your area may have a wrecked camper; unless it's been rolled
the fiberglass top should be okay, and since factory-made campers started
off life as sunroof Buses, you have a nice head start.
