Steve definitely is the man.  Replies a lot to the list and is worth his
weight in gold.

&gt; Just a quick public word of thanks to Steve Sandlin-
&gt;
&gt; I think it's very important to acknowledge good service as well as poor
&gt; service we all get.
&gt;
&gt; I have a 72 Westy that came with only one key.
&gt; from the list I found out we had a fellow listee who specializes in VW
&gt; I gave Steve an email query and he told me exactly where (and how) to pull
a
&gt; lock and find the key code. (The rear hatch is the easiest)
&gt; He also asked for a photocopy of my original key just in case (which I
&gt; forgot to include).
&gt;
&gt; Gave him the Key code and in a matter of days the keys I ordered came in
the
&gt; mail.
&gt; &quot;Hey, these aren't even close!&quot;
&gt; Sent another email to Steve with a copy of the old and new keys and he
&gt; determined the rear hatch lock had probably been replaced and re-keyed to
&gt; match the rest.
&gt; Steve then by looking at my old key, came up with the &quot;correct&quot; code and
cut
&gt; a new one.
&gt; It arrived today and it works better than the original I had.
&gt;
&gt; So, a very big Thanks to Steve!  Great Customer Service!
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
