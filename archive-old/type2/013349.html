Subject: Bus keeps dying
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hello all!

A problem arose today as I drove around town.  The bus
starts of great and runs just fine for the first
couple of stop signs.  From that point on whenever I
take my foot off the gas to slow down the rpms fall
and the engine dies very smoothly.  It start back up
just fine but as soon as it does it the first time it
will continue to do it every time.

The fuel filter was kind of nasty so I replaced it and
the length of fuel line that goes from there to the
carb.  The fuel pump seems to be leaking some nasty
looking gas out of a screw hole, but only slightly. 
It's a brocal pump that I had to use in order to clear
the alternator I used in place of the standard
generator.  

This is on a 1600cc dual port in my '70 Westy.

Any help will be greatly apreciated as I just took her
out of winter hibernation and would like to get some
driving done before it get unbarably hot!

Thanks in advance!

Derrick Gorshe
'70 Westy (A head turner in her new green and siver)
