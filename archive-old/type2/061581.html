Subject: Catalytic converter Q

Hi all:

Just got (and installed) a catalytic converter on my '81 Vanagon.  The 
converter has a port for an O2 sensor, whereas my old (original) 
converter didn't.  The van has an O2 sensor, it's just not screwed into 
the converter.  Instead, the sensor is screwed into a port next to one of 
the flanges to which the converter attaches.

There weren't any instructions included with the converter, and I wasn't 
going to use the O2 sensor port in the converter anyway, so I figured it 
didn't matter which way (front to back) I mounted the converter between 
the two flanges.  However, I ended up mounting the converter with the O2 
port next to the same flange near my current O2 sensor.

Anybody know if it makes any difference (in this case) how I mount the 
converter?
