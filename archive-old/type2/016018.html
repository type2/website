Greetings again. I have just finished rebuilding the brakes, changing the
shocks and the tie-rods. Now for the engine. I drained the oil this
morning. I took out the drain plug then removed the nut for the oil screen
plate. The oil came out of this opening rather watery. Then I smelled a
strong scent of gasoline! There is a strong gaspline smell in the pan of
oil. Whats up with that?

I just bought the vaan second hand from rather callous previous owners.
What should I look for? I want to do a compression test. I have a
compresion gauge. How should I go about it? What is the desired compression? 

I am looking in the Chiltons Manual. I have the 1977 Campmobile Deluxe
(with sink, stove, and refridgerator). What size engine do I have. In the
manual they refer to the GD, GE, and CV types. What do these letters stand
for? 

Thats all for now. I will certainly be appreciative of further assistence
if indeed I will need to drop and repair the engine. Many Thanks,
Davooo
