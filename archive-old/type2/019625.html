Subject: my most amazing discovery!!
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Wow, I am excited.  In the past, I used to spend way too much time
trying at cursing to get those damned valve covers off.  Man, it was a
nightmare.  Well today, I was fishing through my toolbox and I looked at
the brake pliers tool and I thought I would use that to grab the spring
bar and pull it out and down.  Turns out, that tool has the perfect bend
and leverage to get the springs on and off in about 10 seconds.  Easy as
pie.  Amazing.  Its awesome, to put the spring back on the cover, I just
hooked the pliers under the spring and closed the pliers and it
automatically moves the spring up.  Then I use the bend in the pliers to
lever the spring up into position.

I was dreading doing this, but that tool made taking the covers on and
off a BREEEEEZE!!!

later,
Mike
