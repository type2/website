Subject: Re: [T2] What is this AFM for?

Mike asked:


After pointing out to him the flapper sticks in the middle of rotation 
and fuel pump contact did not open at no throttle, a guy at a local vw 
show wanted only $5 for a 7-pin AFM with air cleaner and a nice flexible 
s tube attached.  The flapper just hits on some corrosion I can sand 
away and the contact can be bent in place, but the part number is NOT in 
the bus Bentley- what is this AFM for?
0 280 200 018   - I have good late harnesses and what this for 
daughter's current 75 setup?
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

018 is 01/76 to the end of 77.  It was superceded by the 020 for 77 and Fed 78. 
018 and 020 will interchange.

Most of the info here:  http://www.type2_dot_com/library/fuel/fuelibo.htm
is correct. [79 Cal is WRONG, should be 022]
