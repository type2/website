Subject: rear brake problems
Mime-Version: 1.0

volks,
i was replacing my rear drums and shoes last night. (1975 westy...non-self 
adjust.)  apparently, the adjusting stars have been frozen for quite some 
time (doesn't surprise me, since the PO let it sit for 2 years.)  anyway, i 
managed, with some &quot;gentle persuasion&quot;, to get the stars and nuts out of 
one side (i'll still working on the other side.)

so...here's the problem....

on the passenger side, i have the little metal clip at the base of the adj. 
star/nut housing.  i can only assume that:  this clip provides the &quot;click&quot; 
when adjusting and keeps the adjusting stars from backing out after 
adjusted (and while you are driving.)

this clip is bent down, but might be able to bend it back in place, since 
it doesn't touch the stars now.

the driver's side has NO clip.  now what?  i looked in all of my 
catalogues, and i couldn't find a replacement one.  is the clip welded to 
the adj. star housing?  what is the name of the housing piece?  will i have 
to go junkyarding to find another one?

also, in all of my books, it says that i have retaining pins to hold the 
drums.  i bought a hardware kit, but there are no holes in the backing 
plate for the pins.  the shoes have the holes, they're just not on the 
backing plate.


thanks in advance everyone!!
