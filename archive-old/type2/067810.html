Subject: curtain installation questions

Good morning!

I just bought some curtain hardware from a late '70's bus in hopes of
installing curtains in my '83.5 wasserboxer weekender or the 'new' '79
standard bus. Neither have curtains so I cannot see where to install them.
Does anyone have any advice on how to install this hardware to a bus that
didn't originally have curtains?

Thanks!
