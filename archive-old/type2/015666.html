&gt;I'm making this a general post, as everyone seems to have misunderstood
&gt;me.  I wasn't suggesting you heat your entire bus with these things, just
&gt;the windshield.  I realize that it would never in a million years heat a
&gt;bus, but I was thinking that it might  defrost your windshield.  I used to 
&gt;have to get out and scrape mine every 1/2 mile or so, and I got really
&gt;tired of it.

I think the reason that happened is that there was another thread about an
electric heater going on at the same time.  I bought one of those ceramic
heaters from JC Whipme a long time ago and found that it defrosted about a
2x4&quot; area on my windshield, so technically it works, but practically, it's
useless.  Useless for heating the bus, useless for defrosting.
