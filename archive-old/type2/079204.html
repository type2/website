Subject: steering wheel

Gentlepersons-
                       Looking for steering wheel in thoroughly reprehensible 
condition.
Must have center splined hub and (whatever is under the stock plastic rim that
gives it rigidity) to fit '79 shaft. I've made a few wood rimmed wheels (inc. 
an
oversized - 17&quot; diameter- octagon for an MG), and thought I'd give VW a whirl.
Figured somebody must have replaced a cracked wheel and still might have the
frame hanging on the wall of their garage...I'd rather start with a throwaway
than tear down a usable one...
TIA
