Subject: cross country trip report

Well, i'm home now, fortunately.  It was a hell of a trip.  I was
driving my 70 westy, with newly installed high top.  The bus had run
very well since I bought it in January.  I was worried, but not terribly
worried.  I've never run into a problem that was too big to fix while on
a road trip in my 77, so I knew I could handle it...

So my friend Joe and I left Los Angeles early on a Monday morning.  We
were headed for the Grand Canyon, where we would camp for the night.
The van did very well the first day, and it even got up to 90 once.  We
made pretty good time on the first day.  I should mention here that
fourth gear has been bad since shortly after I bought it, and that I was
using a piece of wood between the shifter and the dash to keep it in
fourth.  We camp in Grand Canyon Village, and by camp I mean sleep in
the van in a dark parking lot.

We wake up the second day, walk around the canyon for an hour or so, and
then hit the road again.  We meant to get to Amarillo, TX that day.  We
stopped at the Meteor Crater, the Petrified Forest and Painted Desert.
About 30 miles out of Albuquerque, NM I pulled the bus over on the
higway after a large clunk sound followed by some shaking... the best I
could hope for was a flat tire (which wasn't good, as I had no spare...
that's just my fault, I forgot to get one before I left).  I tried hand
turning the engine and found that there was something between the piston
and the head.  I had a similar problem on my 77 once, but it was an easy
fix.  I was not so lucky this time.  After getting towed to a Pep Boys
parking lot and sleeping for the night, I pulled the drivers side head
off and removed the valve head that was keeping the engine from turning
over.  The piston was chewed through.  So I pulled out my AIRS list and
called J.P. Henriksen.  J.P. was incredibly helpful, and I would still
be in New Mexico without him.  He called a place and got me a rebuilt
engine, and drove me around town to make the switch.  He also came out
that night at midnight to pull the bus around the parking lot when my
starter wouldn't work.  Before we left that night he let me use his
shower.  I didn't think I needed it, really, but when I got to his house
and saw my face in the mirror, I understood why he was offering.

We drove through the night and all day the next day, through heavy
cross-wind and a huge thunder storm in Texas, until we got to our hotel
in New Orleans at 4AM.  We were in the hotel for three nights, and I
didn't drive the bus at all while we were there.  We did drink a pitcher
of liquor they call the Cajun Monster, though.   It was a good time.

When we left on Sunday we hoped to get to Kansas to sleep.  When we hit
Kansas, the fourth gear finally went.  I limped it in to a uhaul lot to
sleep for the night.  The next day was Memorial Day, and all the truck
rental places were closed, so I had the van towed to the airport in
Louisville, where I found a place I could keep it and rented a car to
drive home to buffalo, NY.  My friend had to be back home for class on
tuesday, so I couldn't even attempt to fix the transmission there.

Well, that's the end of the trip.  The van is in a storage place until a
guy my father knows can go down with his trailer to bring it back up.
In the mean time, I'm working on putting a brand new front beam from Bus
Depot into my 77.  When the 70 gets here, I'll rebuild the transmission
and get it ready to make the trip back to LA in August.

In the end the car trouble didn't really hurt the trip.  And it was nice
to meet a good man like J.P.   I owe him a bottle of  Bourbon at Jerome
this September.  Actually, two bottles.
