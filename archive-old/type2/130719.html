Subject: Re: [T2] Friday Question

Five things, actually:

1. My bookcase behind the front passenger seat, filled with field 
guides to geology, birds, plants, plus stuff to read (John McPhee, Gary 
Snyder, Peter Matthiessen).

2. One of those brass miner's lamps: hangs just to the left of the sink.

3. My Soleri wind bell, purchased at Arcosanti, which hangs from the 
big handle on the poptop.

4. Native American flute.

5. The cheap Raleigh mountain bike (got it for $14 at a junk yard) that 
hangs off the back hatch, like a lifeboat.
