series
&gt; &gt; of &quot;swirls&quot;, for lack of a better word, that make the lenses cloudy when

same

from
&gt; &gt; any angle but straight on. From straight on, however, the lights are
&gt; &gt; EXTREMELY bright and crisply focused. But only from that position.

I have Cibie E-spec lenses in my bus and they do not have any kind of
coating. Maybe its a difference between E-spec lenses and USDOT lenses?
