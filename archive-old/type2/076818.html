Follow up question to List:

Does this mean that if you have an engine case that was used for a
single port or dual carb configuration and you want to go dual port,
you may have to change the stud to a longer stud in order to secure
the center manifold piece if the case was not built for dual port?

&gt;I'm rebuilding a1600DP and I'm about to bolt on the three intake 
&gt;manifold
&gt;sections. The center section has a tang that is secured to the case 
&gt;using
&gt;an existing extra long stud.
&gt;
&gt;When I joined the case halves, I put a nut on that stud and torqued 
&gt;it to
&gt;spec.
&gt;
&gt;At this stage,  doo I remove that nut, slip the manifold tang over 
&gt;the stud
&gt;with its face against the case, and then secure this with the nut?  
&gt;Or do I
&gt;slip the manifold tang up against that nut and add another nut to 
&gt;the stud
&gt;so that the tang is sandwiched between these  two nuts?
&gt;
&gt;It makes a difference because the heat riser flanges must eventually 
&gt;mate
&gt;with those on the muffler.
&gt;
&gt;TIA.  Jack
