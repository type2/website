Ok. this'll be quick because my fingers are all typoed out. :)

we should be up, based off of web-data ~6-24-01, and the 7-22-01
subscriberbase.

If you find that you unsubscribed, and are back, simply send a quick email
to type2-unsubscribe_at_type2_dot_com  or vintagebus-unsubscribe_at_type2_dot_com

for digest users use type2-digest-unsubscribe_at_type2_dot_com or
vintagebus-digest-unsubscribe_at_type2_dot_com

got that?  ok.

yes, they are different from the old stuff, we'll get into that when we
get more organized...this was a bit earlier then I'd plannedsooo. Its
rough.

the older style listname-request_at_type2_dot_com stuff should still work fine.,
though.

ok. enough from me.

oh. one more thing.  the website is still copying over (ok ok i should hae
just linked it, but anyway its to late.) so it might look..we..broken.
it'll work its way fixed.)

any problems, my email should work.

and, due to a screwup, some of the mail may have been lost...if you got a
delivery failure notice (not a deferal notice..) please resend.

some mail is still trapped in the old machine....when i get it back into
server I'll work it through the system.

...david

(and i'm suddenly thinking that some of my stupid and rather annoyed test
messages might start rolling in to...oops.)
