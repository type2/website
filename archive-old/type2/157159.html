Subject: Re: [T2] energy farming  -  the other half

Seeing if my reply gets to you...

If I read this correctly, you think that my idea for
an elecric car that uses solely regenerative charging
for the batteries might not actually work?

I do have a buddy who has the perpetual motion thing
all worked out though! He is converting a car that he
acquired to totally electric power and plans to use it
to drive the &lt;5 miles to &amp; from work each day. He
expects to never have to pay for energy... He works
for a government agency that has power stations at
several parking stalls in their new parking garage (to
encourage electric car users.) This energy is provided
at no cost to the employee. (Except in taxes.) -BaH
