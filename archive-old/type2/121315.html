&gt; Jason, could this be a isolator for the second

&gt; parting out, when the alternator is not putting out
&gt; the battery is isolated from the one that starts the
&gt; bus.. Or it could be a hot start relay, does one of
&gt; the red wires go to the starter soloniod?? could be
&gt; either one of them depending on where the wires go.

Yah, the consensus seems to be a Ford starter relay used as a hot start
relay.  Karl suggested that it would be good to replace it with a
normal relay, since the Ford part is actually a solenoid that sucks
about as much juice as the Bus's starter solenoid.

Last I was underneath the Bus in this area, I do seem to recall that
wired did in fact go to the solenoid.  I'll put &quot;map out the apparently
modified starter wiring&quot; on my to-do list.

Thanks for the quick replies, everybody.

Feliz Aqo Nuevo.
