Will,

Thanks for your reply!  It makes me feel much more comfortable that others
have had success on 'less than ideal tires'.

From: Will 

sounds like you are in pretty good shape with reinforced sidewall and close
to the correct max rated load at each corner, and also close to the standard
size.  I am not nominating myself the tire nazi; rather I am just pushing
the ideal now that I have figured it out.  I have been driving on less than
ideal tires for a long time, and trying to atone for my ways.
