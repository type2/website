Tim (and the list):

There's a line in all the manuals to the effect of &quot;Check that all
electrical connections are clean and tight.&quot;  After having random starting
problems for several months, replacing various components in the system,
getting more and more frustrated, I (for some unknown reason) grabbed and
pulled the battery cable several weeks ago, and it popped out of the
terminal that connects to the battery!  It had LOOKED fine, and the &quot;clamp&quot;
was clean and tight, but the connection inside was intermittant and nasty
with corrosion...

I now have a back-up starting system to haul around with me (alt, v.r.,
extra cables...) or assist others on the road.

So, please start with the simple stuff so that my expensive lesson benefits
someone besides me.  8^)

Subject: alternator question


&gt;I'm looking for advice here.  '79 stock cal spec westy.
&gt;
&gt;I just had my alternator rebuilt since it had some miles and I had the
&gt;engine out anyway for a rebuild.  Now by rebuilt, I mean I took the
&gt;alternator to the local reputable auto-electric shop and requested that it
&gt;be checked out, new bearings and brushes installed and whatever else might
&gt;be needed, even though it worked fine before I took it in.  After
&gt;installing the new engine, everything was fine for the first 300 miles
&gt;until taking a 100 mile road trip, when the alternator and OXS light came
&gt;on when I was cruising steady at 60 mph.  I pulled over and could find
&gt;nothing wrong, but the lights were gone when I restarted.  I completed my
&gt;trip, but now a couple of days later, the battery and OXS light are on
&gt;again and seem to stay on.  I've tried installing a different known good
&gt;voltage regulator, with no apparent effect.  I can't locate any obvious
&gt;wiring fault.
&gt;
&gt;Is there a way to test alternator function while the alternator is in the
&gt;car?  I need to get to the bottom of this ASAP since I plan a long vacation
&gt;trip in a week.  Please respond to the list or pmail me at
&gt;multipang_at_kconline_dot_com.  Any help is appreciated.
