Subject: Micrometer Check

Feeler Gauges are a great check for your micrometer but only tell you that
the tool is accurate at the bottom 5% of its measurement range.....which is
fine if you are primarily using it to measure things within that range. It
is nice to know that the tool is accurate over it full range. Although Dowel
Pins are not common over 1/2&quot; Diameter, Plug Gauges up to 1.0000 + .0001&quot;
are available from McMaster Carr for around $10/each. This is probably
overkill for most people but can be important depending on what you need to
measure.

On another note I am waiting for the rain to stop so that I can start
working on my newly acquired $1300 '73 Westfalia. Passenger Window regulator
is broken and window is in down position with plastic currently taped in
place.
