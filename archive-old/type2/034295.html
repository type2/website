First, when you get your bus on the road, _don't_ loan it to your
girlfriend's sister!

&gt; So, i need to get my 72 on the road pronto.  My question is how much
&gt; should I get a loan for to cover an engine (1700cc), a tranny, cv
&gt; shafts, clutch, and miscellaneous stuff that i need for a complete
&gt; mechanical resto.  Is $4000 way under budget.

Costs tend to rise to the level of the budget.

Tranny will run about $700, CVs will be about $200, clutch about $100,
(these are parts costs only) which leaves the engine.  Type IV folks
will have to advise you on that.  A lot depends upon where you live. 
If you have a good rebuilder nearby it is best to go with them. 
Otherwise there are some rebuilders of good reputation such as Boston
Engine and AVP.

&gt; Any help/ and or input
&gt; would be great.  PS- whats the best and cheapest way to get a good
&gt; engine- send mine out to be rebuilt or go through a company like AVP
&gt; or
&gt; GEX.  Anyone know any good suppliers?

My advice is to avoid GEX.  I made the mistake of buying one of their
type 1 engines.  See the archives for my (and many other) horror
stories.

On rebuilt engines, avoid the temptation to go with the cheapest price.
 It has been pointed out that the majority of aircooled owners only
keep their cars for a year or so, so it behooves the rebuilders to
supply engines that are good for only two years or so.  Often, these
engines are sold for less than the _parts_ cost of a good rebuild. 
Cheap tends to drive out good, but there are good rebuilders out there
who charge a fair price that reflects their parts cost and labor.  If
you're willing to pay this cost up front, you will have years of
trouble-free service from your engine.
