Subject: Re: [T2] Help with final decision on tires for Westy

Doyt --

The 94 load rating may officially translate into 1,477 lbs of load on some
table, but my Conti CR12's have &quot;Max. Load 1540 lbs.&quot; molded right on their
sidewalls. My '67 is not a camper, and I didn't want &quot;small truck&quot; tires on
it. (The max. pressure molded on the tire is indeed 40 psi.) When Nemo
mentioned the Conti's I was glad to find appropriately spec'ed and proper
looking tires for a Deluxe.

Related question to the list: Is there any appropriately spec'ed tire that
has whitewalls? Are all those guys featured in the magazines doing the wrong
thing, with wobbly &quot;P&quot; passenger tires?

&gt; The Continental is a 94R, indicating a 1,477 load index; the Agilis load
index is 102R, indicating 1,874 load index; and the Cooper load index is
102/100 Q, indicating 1,764 and 1,874 load indexes respectively, dependent
on inflation pressure.

The Continental carries a 94 load index (1,477 pounds at 40psi).
