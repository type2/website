Subject: RE: [T2] Looking for good used parts for 82 Westy...

&gt; I would love to find the following parts used, 
&gt; semi-cheap, and in good condition. 
&gt; 
&gt; Oil Cooler
&gt; Injectors
&gt; Set of heads
&gt; clutch
&gt; stock exaust system (complete)



Some of this stuff is just not smart to buy used. A used clutch - when a
whole brand new Sachs kit is just over $100? It's penny-wise and
dollar-foolish to skimp on stuff like that, only to have to tear
everything apart again to re-do it because you put in a used clutch that
started chattering right away or three months down the road. The clutch,
oil cooler, and complete exhaust (if you didn't need a cat setup) would
only cost you $400 or so brand new, for quality OEM parts. You'd
probably have to pay half that much for used anyway. For all the work
you would have to do all over again when the used parts failed, is it
really worth it to save a couple hundred bucks? What is your time worth?
How much will towing cost you if your used parts fail far from home?  I
can certainly see buying used parts in cases where they cost a fortune
new - you have to make hard choices and take your chances to keep it in
your budget. I've been there myself many times, and in fact I frequently
recommend used parts to customers who get sticker-shock when they find
out what the new part costs. But some of these are wear-prone parts that
just aren't all that expensive new to begin with.  Of course it's your
van and your choice, so consider this food for thought.
