hello all
just picked up 2 more Stewart Warner gas heaters...
one is a 12V and the other is a 6V...the 6 is going for parts for my
other 6V heater.
On the 12V one there are 2 extra hoses coming off where the spark plug
is (on the other side) and a smaller hose coming off nearby it towards
the top of the big cylinder...you know..the one with the heat shield.
The one hose is black rubber-is stuff and is not very strong (like
vacuum hose) and is thinner walled...the other hose is smaller.
if someone could explain to me what these are for I would love it.
Also, could someone explain to me how to hook one of these bad boys up?
electrical that is...and how everything should work... if you could do
so tonight that would be great as I won't have time to monkey with them
for a while otherwise..
you know...its one of those instant gratification things...

thanks all!
Isaiah
