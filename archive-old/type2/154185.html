Subject: Re: [T2] Foldable Spare

I've never owned a veedub but I recall reading an owners manual or something
for late model type 2 westy's and they came with an uninflated spare tire
and an inflator can for it that stowed in one of the interior cabinets.

Presumably in the deflated state the rubber tire folded in on itself to save
space otherwise what would of been the point?
