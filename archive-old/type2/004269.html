A couple of things will cause this:
Loose fitting center caps.
TOO much grease in the hubs. Too much causes the grease/ bearings to
overheat.


&gt; I recently replaced the front wheel bearings and grease seals on my '79
&gt; westy and packed the hubs with a high temperature wheel bearing grease
from
&gt; my local FLAPS.  This grease seems to flow out from under the hubcaps when
&gt; I drive and makes a mess underneath the hubcaps and eventually on the rims
&gt; outside of the hubcaps.  What's up with that?
