I have use a couple turns of muffler repair material around the seam and 
then put the clamp on top of that for loose clamps. It held up pretty 
well on the couple i did it on.

&gt; TNX, nice to know i'm not the only one with this

&gt; It could be that my ill-fitting collars are out of
&gt; some after market muffler that was on the bus over the
&gt; years. The ernst muffler came with everything in the
&gt; way of hardware, except new fresh-air collars.
&gt; Plan A: make vertical hacksaw cuts in the collars to
&gt; see if I can pinch, pound, squeeze and generally
&gt; downsize them into the heat exchangers.
&gt; Plan B: Snip 2 sheets of galv or thick aluminum
&gt; flashing to right size. Then roll them into 4&quot; long
&gt; cylinders that will fit the holes. The hose clamps
&gt; should hold the whole mess together. Hey, it's just
&gt; heating air blowing through there...
