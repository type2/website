Subject: Re: [T2] 76 teardown

Billy:
This has happened to me a few times. I'll answer your questions as they come up:


&gt;
&gt; questions:
&gt;
&gt; should all cylinders/pistons be replaced?

Depends on several factors: condition of the others, i.e. mileage and wear, intended use in the future. New sets can be had for perhaps $225 as posted by Stan Wilder recently. This saves a lot of time cleaning and reconditioning and usually ensures fairly close balance between all the pistons. (there have been
as many as 4 or 5 different brands over the years and the weight may vary considerably.)

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; should both heads be replaced if I do one, and is used okay?

Actually, used is about your only choice. I'd try to find a machinist I trusted, see if he has any cores, maybe you'll have to go to a junkyard to find the parts. I'd additionally replace the guides and valves in the other head and have the seats re-machined and also check the condition of the spigot holes
(head gasket area).76-78 are the same. 74 and 74 will fit on, but I'd only use them in pairs. They have bigger valves, may give a slight power increase. 72 and 73 will fit if flycut to the larger bore size. This is also a good plan, IF and only if, your machinist knows what he is doing.
If replacing only the 3-4 head, make sure you have the correct one for the fuel injection temperature sensor. This can be added by a good machinist.
It's been years, but I believe RIMCO is a good company. I'm sure there are many.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I'm 10 minutes from CB perfomance.

I'm NOT a fan of CB Performance.

&gt; Should I have them split this case to inspect cam/crank/innerds?

I'd question whether you need to take the engine that far apart. I'd probably just blast out the debris with an  air gun and possibly take off one rod and check the condition of the bearing. If it looks good, I'd reassemble from there.

&gt; Anyone ever used them for this with a t4?
&gt;
&gt; this engine had a factory(?) a/c compressor mounted to it which I will not reuse. makes &quot;air&quot; noises when you spin the drive pulley, so I assume it functions. what would it's value be and if anyone's interested, let me know.

This is a key part for anyone to make their A/C work. I've still got one, but I'd bet someone needs it. should be worth $25 or more to anyone that needs it.
