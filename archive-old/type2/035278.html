&gt;
&gt;OK, I just bought my second bus (72 Westy) long story but it turned out to
&gt;be cheaper to purchase this bus than it was going to cost me for a set of
&gt;carbs for my 79 2L (the westy came with an extra set of Weber IDF 40's).
&gt;The 72' has set for at least 3 years and none of the previous owners have
&gt;ran it at ALL.  Yesterday (saturday) I finally got it fired up and though it
&gt;ran rough it did atleast run.  Now.... does anyone have any suggestions on
&gt;the following........
&gt;
&gt;1.  I think I need to purge the brake fluid.  The fluid in the reservoir is
&gt;thick and yellow as opposed to thin and clear like new brake fluid am I
&gt;right? if so what is the best way to totally purge the entire system? Also
&gt;the Brake Pedal is extremely stiff to push and the little break light is on?
&gt;is this all tied to old break fluid?

Yes, and flushing and bleeding with new fluid is standard yearly
maintenance if the humidity sits above 60% for more than a few months per
year, whether you drive it or not. If you live in the Mohave, every 2 or 3
years might be reasonable. The new fluid will work like a solvent to
dissolve the tar/gum/goo/varnish that has contaminated the SYSTEM. Some of
the calipers or cylinders will probably start leaking once this buildup of
crud is removed.  You need to rebuild or replace all the calipers and
cylinders for reasonable future service. 

&gt;
&gt;2.  I had to replace the fuel pump (the old one I replaced was electric) I
&gt;think the fuel gel'ed in the pump cause it wouldn't do anything when I
&gt;hooked the power up to it.  I'm concerned about existing fuel in the system
&gt;do I just dilute it with new fuel and be proactive about changing filters
&gt;(I've got 3 inline between tank and carb right now) or should I somehow
&gt;flush the old fuel out.

Same problem. The residues and and varnishes have contaminated the SYSTEM.
Do not try to start the vehicle or run old fuel through that new pump until
you have at least drained the tank, flushed and drained again with a few
gallons of fresh fuel, and added fresh fuel to start, changing the filter.
No need for three in there. Run a full tank through the filter then replace
it once. Dissasemble the short use filter for empirical evidence of
continued flotsom from the tank. Do replace the screen in the tank outlet,
but of course you will see that when you drain the tank.

Replacing all the fuel lines as you suggest below ist gut. After replacing
it and servicing the tank as above, hook it all back up, except the return
line to the tank. Put than in a container then run the pump off the battery
with jumpers to pump a gallon or so through the lines. Pull the injectors
for visual inspection while in the start mode. Poor mist pattern? Clean or
rebuilt or replacement required. 

&gt;
&gt;I am planning on doing plugs and replacing ALL the fuel line next
&gt;weekend.... Any other suggestions for a van that has set for a long period
&gt;would be greatly appreciated.

Everything rubber on the vehicle should be inspected. Brake hoses will
swell shut with no evidence of a problem on the outside, again, due to the
contamination alchemy between poly ethyl ester and moisture from
absorbtion. Check all the boots for suspension joints, steering links,
drive joints, injection harness fittiings, glass and door seals.........

Of course, it is best to do the inspection BEFORE you negotiate the
purchase price. Please do not take that as a put down. Joint the club. It's
a big one. 

&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;-Tim
