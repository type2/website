&gt; Sounds like you didn't adjust the valves correctly,

I agree that this sounds like the valves were not closing. A preload of 2
turns will cause this.

There is a good method for running in hydraulics on the bostonengine_dot_com
website. I just tried to go there to paste in the right page link, but the
site is down at the moment.

Basically, hydraulics should be adjusted to .006 clearance on a new engine
and the motor run in this way. Then they should be adjusted with preload,
but not as much as 2 turns, especially if the lifers are brand new.
