I'm considering selling my 1970 single cab. I really want to get a pre-'67
single cab.

It has been modified with a 1974 nose and therefore has disc brakes. It has
some rust but it is minimal. It has a stong 1600 single port. It also has a
gas heater and the original canvas canopy. It is very solid. If anyone is
interested email me off the list. There is a picture of it on my web site.
