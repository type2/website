&gt;Are there any little fiber separators or something that will stop these
&gt;squealing brakes ?.
&gt;The old brakes were this way and I never did find a fix.
&gt;I followed the break in instructions of stopping gently for about 20
&gt;tiimes from 30 mph.

Non-migrating grease on the back of the pads, on the edges, on the pins and
on the spreader spring and pins. Just a thin film is all that is called
for. I use the Sta-Lube product designed for the purpose. Factory pads,
soft, black and non-metallic. On the breakin, you must be sure to give a
1/4 mile between applications to insure you don't overheat them. Also, when
reusing rotors in good order, bevel the outer and inner edges of the pads
with a file so they don't ride on the wear ridges of the rotor. Metallic
pads not only create a higher propensity for squeeks, but will wear out
your rotors much faster.
