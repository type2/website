Subject: Anticipation ...

Three o'clock in the morning. Outside, a gentle rain washes the air. In 
a few hours there will be daylight, and then the test only smog 
inspection place will open for business. I want to sleep now, but I 
cannot. After 18 months of work and too much expense, I am going to have 
Peregrine smogged.

If she behaves and keeps her monoxide and hydrocarbon levels at bay, I 
will at long last get some license plates (Yosemite) to bolt on front and 
back. I'll have to get a bracket for the front bumper though. Could have 
done this in advance, but I don't want to jinx myself.

Maybe: no more trips to the Department of Motor Vehicles to beg for 60 day 
stickers. No more standing in line wondering whether they'll give me 
another one (the score: four times yes, one time no. Not in that order.) 

To get ready, I spent most of the weekend at work on her. Little of what 
I did had anything to do with emissions. I did replace my valve adjusters 
and set the lash just so; for my efforts I got a slightly noisier bus.

I decided some time last week that I did not want to have to explain to 
the tester how to start the motor: Key to on position, reach over to 
where the lighter should be and push the button. So I spent an hour or 
two in the junkyard going over procedure: how to remove the ignition 
switch and lock without destroying the plastic covers. Got a unit for 
$12, had the tumbler re-keyed for a whopping $20, and set about 
installing it. Now starting is conventional, and the steering wheel 
locks. As I worked on this, on Saturday, I wondered whether the mail 
would bring the steering coupler that I ordered from Bus Depot, so that I 
could install that while I had everything loose. Sure enough, there was a 
little package in the mailbox. After a couple more hours' work (mostly 
driving from one FLAPS to another hunting for 8M locknuts), the coupler 
was in place and the old one, badly cracked and ready to send us 
careening across eight lanes of traffic, was in the trash.

Last job in this series was to splice the wire to the starter relay back 
together, where I had cut it for a shunt line to the button. A little 
solder, a bit of shrink vinyl, and I could start Peregrine with the key.

I restored the shifter to stock, but by the time I adjusted the stick it 
was dark out and I couldn't see well enough to set it at 90 degrees. On 
the test drive I couldn't find second gear -- it was somewhere under the 
glove compartment. Back home to let that sit overnight.

Replaced the big center heater duct, discarding the old pinched one. Now
there's no oil smell! Oil from disasterous leaks in the past must have
found its way up there and settled, never to burn off. And man, is there
heat! Like a blast furnace. 

Now there is a hole in the dash, waiting for a cigarette lighter, and a 
starter button waiting to be installed in the engine bay. It will have to 
wait a while.

So now I wait.

What if she doesn't pass? I have dreamed some crazy schemes, like parking 
her in Flagstaff, Arizona, and registering her there (where there is no 
smog requirement). Then I could drive the Saab out and switch.

But that's not in the cards. If she doesn't pass, I'll fix whatever is 
wrong and try again. I'll have to stand in line at the DMV again, 
however. This is the last day on my current 60 day sticker.

It's 3:55. Only three hours and thirty-five minutes to go. Think I will 
pace for a while.

Thanks for listening...
