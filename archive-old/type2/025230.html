Hi George (and all),

Thanks for the quick response.

Yep, I really am new to engines ... I didn't realize the springs compressed
during strokes.  Engine operations 101!  I pulled out the spark plugs (man,
are they in TIGHT!!!  The VW Mexico factory slams them pups in) and turned
the flywheel and -- wow, the springs do compress with each stroke :)

As for the studs -- I agree -- new non-rusted studs shouldn't be too bad to
have drilled out.

Also -- My case does indeed appear to have the holes drilled for the rear
mount -- the other listee in Indiana said his (Beelemex engine holes) were
not drilled out.

I still need to go over the whole engine to make sure there isn't other
damage...

  Stephen Gutknecht
