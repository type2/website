Subject: Re: [T2] used motor for the hanger queen

Randy,
your last name struck my curiousity so i thought id
read your post, although no relation im sure. 
Good to hear your motivation on getting the bus out a
teh garage. I myself sold my '70 bus once i completed,
adn painted it. (regrets) especially my daughter 2 yr
old , she loved that thing.

Good luck w/ your rebuild, im not to familar w/ the
pancake configuration, but i would recommend changing
all teh gas lines with quality german hose, if you
havent already done so, also resecure and beefup the
gas line where it enters the firewall..

peace,
