Subject: Fan Bolts

Howdy....anyone have any idea of the tool name to extract the fan bolts? You 
know, the three star- shaped-twelve-point-thingies that bolt the fan onto 
the crank.... Also the size?

Engine is on the woirkbench, and I'm finally getting after that lifter that 
won't come out the good (read easy) side...

Thanks in advance!
