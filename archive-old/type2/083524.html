Hey there Terry,

Since you are in LA you should have no problem at all finding a bus.
Those of us in the northeast have a tougher time finding a rust-free
driver, but they are plentiful on the left coast.

The price that is always mentioned on the list is $5000 for a decent
bus. Expect to invest that amount either up front (inital purchase
price) or by the installment plan (cheap bus + ~5000 in repairs).
You're looking for a driver, so figure on budgeting around $5000 for
your search. 

Check out your local recycler mag, and hit the vw online classifieds
websites (links are on my website, see sigline below). Don't buy the
first bus you see, but rather look at several of them to get a feel
for what you really want in your bus (and what you don't want in a
bus). 

If you're uncomfortable doing mechanical repairs then it would be
wise to have a PPI (pre-purchase inspection) done on any bus you are
seriously considering. It might cost a little to have a aircooled vw
professional check out the bus, but this will insure that you will be
able to &quot;get in and go&quot;. If there are issues to be addressed on the
bus, you can haggle on the sale price with the seller, and get them
fixed. Finding a shop to preform the PPI is a no-brainer 'cause
you're going to need to find a shop to do routine maintenance on it
anyways.

A bus has a higher maintenance schedule then modern disposable cars.
If you plan on being a back-pocket mechanic (reach in your back
pocket every time something needs to be fixed), you can lessen the
hit on your wallet by preforming some of the easier tasks and pay for
the things that you don't have the patience for. 

These are 20-30 something year old buses, so if you're not going to
work on the bus yourself expect to have to pay every so often to keep
it in &quot;get in and go&quot; condition.

Hope this helps,
