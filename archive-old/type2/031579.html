&gt; My question is what type of exhaust setup will offer the most ground

the stock system by far

&gt; and also the Pacesetter one piece.  I would prefer to go with the stainless
&gt; steel stock setup, as I know the fit and workmanship will be much better,

I have the stainless steel setup and don't count on the workmanship.  I
found the tailpipe when mounted as set up hit my bumper and pointed upward
at about a 30degree angle, finally cut it and rewelded it at a correct
angle.  the tailpipe not the muffler that is, the tailpipe is just mild
steel so can be easily welded
