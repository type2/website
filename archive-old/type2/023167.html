i spent most of last week putting insulation and cutting carpet for my 
westy.  we had a large rain storm tuesday and apparently my bus leaked...a lot.

so, when i discovered this tragedy yesterday morning, i promptly pulled all 
of my hard work up, and pointed a fan at it.  anyway, i know the water 
didn't come through the passenger wall panel (behind the sliding door) 
because none of the insulation in that wall was wet.  all of the wetness 
was within 2 feet of the sliding door.  i removed the sliding door and 
replaced the door seal with one i bought about a month ago.

also, since i couldn't do anything inside the now wet bus, i replaced the 
poptop seal and flat seal...since they were non-existent thanks to the PO.

so, is there anywhere else that the water could have come into the 
bus?  the window seal on the louvered door is in good shape.  was the 
sliding door seal that crappy?  i'm just afraid to get everything dried up 
and find out that it is coming from somewhere else.

thanks volks!
