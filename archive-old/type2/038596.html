The seat may be &quot;sat out&quot; or worn oddly.  It may be whoever owned the
Bus in the past had a real habit of sitting on the edge of the seat (scary
driver?!?) and wore out the springs in the seat.  Check the underside
of the seat to check for broken springs (another possibility).  Depending
on what you find, it may be easier to replace the seat.  Wolfsburg West
sells really nice quality horsehair pads, just like the original seat pads
in your VW, I have them in my Beetle and my Kombi and they make all
the difference in the world for comfort!  If you have broken springs, they
may be able to be wire tied back together, but it might be just as well
to search for a seat in a parts bus or at the swap meets this summer
and rebuild a seat with good springs.

&gt;I have 2 questions about my '71 camper that I cannot find an answer to.
&gt;Hope someone can help.
&gt;  1.  The front passenger seat tilts forward just enough to make it
&gt;uncomfortable (feels like you are going to slide out of it ).  I am talking
&gt;about the seat portion, not the back rest portion, of the seat.  Is there
&gt;some kind of rubber block or something that is suppose to be positioned
&gt;under the front part of the seat to raise it a little so it does not have
&gt;this forward tilt in it??
&gt;  2. What is the correct method for fastening the sliding door curtain to
&gt;the plastic hens-teeth slides that fit into the aluminum channel.  I read
&gt;something on here about 2 months ago that referred to the the hens-teeth
&gt;being connected to the curtain material via some kind of cording.  In the
&gt;curtain that I had, the circle part of the hens-teeth was attached  to the
&gt;curtain by just sewing thread thru the curtain material and then thru the
&gt;circle on the hens-teeth.  Is this the correct method?   Thanks in advance
&gt;to everyone for all of the wonderful advice we have received on here.
