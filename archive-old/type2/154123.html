Subject: Re: [T2] distributor shaft washer

I am looking at a dismantled case ... and the webbing in the cam shaft gear 
area will not allow the distributor shim to pass into the sump area... no 
way you will find it in one piece thru into the sump ...

If the gear throws it over to the other side of the case... then you might 
find it in the &quot;taco&quot; plate area... where the dipstick end is. It would have 
to sling it thru a hole in the webbing... i think that is like getting a 
ping pong ball in the saucer at the fair.

the cam gear spins down on the left side,, so,, logically,, if it were to 
fall against the gear,, it would take it to the bottom of the case.. as 
would gravity..

as far as I can tell... there is no way to remove that shim without removing 
the oil pump.. or splitting the case

IMHO,, I wouldn't worry about it.... I would turn the engine over a few 
times by hand.. and if it isn't jamming .,,, then it is safetly at the 
bottom of the cam gear cavity,,
