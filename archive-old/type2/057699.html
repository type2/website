&gt;The way I understand the process, the engine mounts and rear transmission

I wouldn't do it that way.

&gt;My question is whether the front
&gt;transmission mounts and transmission shift linkage must be disconnected in
&gt;order to prevent damage/bending.

They definately should be disconnected before you try to separate the
engine/trans.

&gt;Any ideas or suggestions are welcomed.

Disconnect all of that stuff and drop the engine and trans all the way to
the ground, then separate the engine/trans and do what you have to do.
Don't forget to unhook the fuel line, ground strap, etc.
