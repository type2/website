&gt; An absorption muffler is a straight-thru pipe i.e no baffles,
&gt; with holes in the wall and a sleeve of glass wool immediately outside
&gt; those holes, encased by an outer shell.  The effect is to absorb
&gt; treble noise ('cackle'), while failing to absorb bass.  The British
&gt; mfr Burgess supplied these first to Triumph c.1961.  I suspect those
&gt; ludicrously loud Harley Hawgs have this type of &quot;muffler&quot;.
&gt;
BTW, those of us who's drains spin in the right direction will recognize
those mufflers as Glass-Packs or Cherry-Bombs...A guy on another list
made his own out of stainless steel with a screw off end to refill the
fiberglass batting...;-)
And, BTW II, those are Harley &quot;HOGS&quot; and, as with everything else
Harley, HOG is copyright, Harley-Davidson...Potato(e, for you Dan
Quayle fans), Potato(e), Potato(e)...Also copyright Harley-Davidson... ;-)
