&gt; I have a 72 type 2 and I need a couple of minor parts.
&gt; a.  a  turn signal assembly
&gt; b.  a driver side, rear, marker light
&gt; anyone who has these for sale drop me a private e-mail
&gt; additionally a web page URL would be appreciated



Visit my website.  New rear side marker lenses are about $10 and front turn
signal lenses about $15.
