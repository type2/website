&amp;gt; I have a related question.  I have a '79 federal - when I turn on the heat I
&amp;gt; get some nasty engine smells.  Where should I look first - the air tube, the
&amp;gt; H/Es or could I just be sucking the smell in from the squirrel cage in the
&amp;gt; engine compartment or ???

Heat exchangers, is leaking oil dripping on them?  Hot oil stinks, and
it's a bear to clean the exchangers.  I cleaned mine by soaking them is
solvent for quite a while then washed them out with a stream of water.
After that, I'm very careful to make sure that the valve cover gaskets are
leak-free.

Engine air seals, are they tight, or is exhaust being drawn into the
engine bay?

General engine bay cleanliness.
