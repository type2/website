&gt; Never heard of a VW stock installation of a 1700 in a pre-72 bus anywhere,

I will have to dig for that info. If it was written in a Euro publication it
might be a misunderstanding. Often in Euro publications, calender production
is noted as opposed to model year production. Therefore if a euro
publication noted that the Type4 motor was offered in 1971 they might have
been refering to the 1972 model year (begins August 1971) for which the
type1 motor was installed as standard.

As long as we are dicussing &quot;urban bus legends&quot; I have read and been told
that front disk brakes were optional for the 1970 model year. Any buses out
there to support this?
