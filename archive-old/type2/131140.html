Subject: removing shifter slop '71

Id like to remove most of the slop from the shift linkage of my 71.
Reviewing the archives and library, it seems that there are 4 main wear 
items:
- the bushing at the front of the front shift rod (Bentley guide sleeve)
- the 2 bushings on the rear shift rod
- the coupler at the back of the rear shift rod
Anything else?

Replacing the guide sleeve and coupler seem straightforward and possible w 
tranny in the van.
Replacing the rear bushing on the rear shift rod seems impossible w tranny 
in.
Questions re front bushing on rear shift rod:
- Is it possible to replace w tranny in?
- If possible, would there be much improvement, worth the trouble, or is 
this probaby best left til the trannys out and both can be done?
Thanks
