Just remember, you get what you pay for.  If a customer wanted to
bargain my shop rates, I'd be 'forced' to cut corners. If you don't like
the man's price, go somewhere else.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; Does anyone out there, have an old flat rate manual for mechanical shop
&gt; times?
&gt; I am negotiating with VW for the price to get my valves done.
&gt; They are claiming 10 hours to R&amp;R the engine, plus the price of R&amp;Ring
&gt; the heads, plus the price of the valve job, plus, plus, plus.
&gt; I'm telling them it should take no more than 8 hours to remove and
&gt; replace the engine and heads, especially since the guy doing it is a
&gt; Deutschlander, who has done it more than once in his life, the only
&gt; problem is he is a perfectionist, and is quoting big times to cover is
&gt; dupa.
