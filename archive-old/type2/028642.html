Pat,

BIKR RACK:
I spent some time carefully anchoring an aluminum 14&quot;x1&quot;x1&quot; angle iron
to the top ledge of the rear door on my 79 westy. It acts
like a shelf. With 4 holes drilled into the bottom edge, I zip tied
the top bar of a trunk mount TULE bike rack($50). Likewise, I
bolted a similar aluminum angle iron just above the rear door lock.
Here too, I zip tied the bottom bar to the holes drilled into the
aluminum angle iron.

TARP:
I drilled and bolted on each end a 1.5&quot; &quot;U&quot; bolt into the top sliding door
edge
of my pop-top. Then removing the side screw that holds the top of the
luggage/wood rack,
I screwed a metal &quot;P&quot; shape piece of garage scrap. These carabineer clip to
3 of the 4 available
eye holes of the tarp. Holding up the 2 opposite ends of the tarp are
typical pole,
steak and rope setup. When attached, while raising the Poptop, the tarp
forms a nice vaulted
ceiling with a small triangular opening.
