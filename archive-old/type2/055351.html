Subject: Trailer Hitch Q's??

Oh Mighty List -

I'm thinking about a trailer hitch for Itch (69 Westy). My boat/trailer
weigh a total of about 850 pounds.

I also don't want to drill and cut a bunch of visible areas to mount a
hitch.

What hitches have what mount points? Pictures? Close-ups?

Also, would anyone discourage me from putting a hitch on due to overloading
the engine, brakes, etc..? I've read the Type2 Library re: 1,100 pound
limit, etc.. but it doesn't say anything about specific hitches available.

TIA -
