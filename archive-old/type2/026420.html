Brian, I'm no expert, so I can't say for sure what it means, but I've rebuilt a few earlier ('64-'71) engines, and I'll be happy to share what I know.

First off, you have several types of metal in the engine. You have brass on the distributor drive gear; aluminum on the crankshaft (main) bearings (I'm ASSUMING aluminum for later bearings); hardened steel on the crankshaft; steel on the camshaft bearings. Using a magnet and some cleaning agents, you may be able to determine what type of metal you're seeing.

Personally, I wouldn't risk driving if I got that many paper-thin chips. What I'm guessing you're seeing is a crankshaft or camshaft bearing frying (use a magnet; it'll tell you which one). I'd hope for camshaft bearing failure, because crankshaft bearing failure is more apt to hammer a case (I don't know about aluminum; I'm thinking magnesium). Your case may still be good, but if you run it until the bearing disappears, odds are that it won't remain good...at least that's the case with magnesium cases, which is where all my experience lies.

I'd check end-play by hand. I don't know if you can do this on T4 cases. On T2 cases, I'd remove the fan belt and then push/pull. If I could see any play, I'd assume my crankshaft bearings were going and had already hammered the case at the big, front bearing. Depending on how many times the case had been cut, I might decide it was time to look for a new engine...and leave the old engine in so I could move the bus while I looked. You don't have the same concerns with a T4, I think, so a bunch of what I just said may have no bearing (no pun intended).

I'd be cautious, even if I could come up with a reasonable explanation for the metal chips. Honestly, if this was a fresh rebuild, I'd be less concerned than with it being an older, or moderate-mileage engine. I'm guessing you're right on the edge of system failure, but hopefully on the front side, before too much damage has occurred.

If you choose to keep driving, I'd recommend changing the oil again soon, like in the next few days, while it's hot. The object here is to clean the engine of any remaining particles; then change the oil frequently and pay attention to how much metal comes out. It could be one of the bad things I described above, or, not knowing the providence of your engine, it could be that someone built it without cleaning all the crap out of the case and this stuff just dislodged and wound up in your screen, without any damage occurring.

Have you got an oil pressure gauge and sending unit? That might be a good indicator of what's going on. As the bearings wear, oil pressure would drop, I think.

Good luck! Joe
