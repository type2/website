Subject: replacing ball joint seal

I am considering replacing a ball joint seal and was
wondering how much look I was looking at.
After reading Muirs section on ball joint replacment I
was thinking that all the steps were not necessary since
I am not replacing the hole thing.

Could some one who has done this provide me with the
steps necessary to replace just the seal.
By the way its the top seal on the drivers side.
Also if it means anything I have never done any work in
this area before.

Thanks in advance,
Alex
