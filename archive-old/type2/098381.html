&gt; Given that, it would appear that MB feels 230 degrees F is a monitor point

&gt;
&gt; Of course, we are talking 8.5 Qts of oil in the gut as opposed to our bus
&gt; capacity of 3 Qts.

Since we are talking about a continuous flow of heat, the amount of oil
does not make much difference.  The only thing that a large oil capacity
does is slow down the warmup a bit.  It won't change the ultimate
temperatures.
