Since I don't think that the most knowledgeable Dr. Hoover is back from
Inuvik yet, I'll comment on this idea.

Before you cut any holes in the tin on your motor, you might want to check
out the CFM capacity of the VW fan.  As I remember, it is over 1k cfm.
Therefore, if one mounts a 2&quot; electric fan to move air over the cylinders,
I believe that, at speed, the airflow will be in the other direction. Thus
giving decreased cooling.

Just my $.02 worth.
