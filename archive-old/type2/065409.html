&gt; BTW I'd take a '77 in a heartbeat as well, hydraulic lifters will run
&gt; you only $100 the set, pushrods anothe $40-$50, and will drop in on
&gt; the car in a couple of hours, or you can just keep doing adjustments.
&gt; For that matter '76 or '75 OK as well, the f.i. really didn't get any
&gt; better, as long as its 2.0 they are about the same, the early ones
&gt; have the different floor layout of course but all are still the ultimate
&gt; in air cooled Westy IMHO.

John and others,
I believe that the '75 engine was 1.8L and fuel injected rather than
2.0L which started in '76.  Am I right?
