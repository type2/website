was a
&gt; little spring, kind of like a ball point pen spring, but not as
long. &gt; What the heck are these things, and how did they come to be

They're the center contact and its spring from the distributor cap. 
Just replace the distributor cap and rotor with new parts and you'll
be in good shape.
