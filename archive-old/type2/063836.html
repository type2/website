Hey Roy, you have offered me many tid bits of advice and now it is time 
for me to return the favor.

Don't look *anyplace* else for a wiring loom other than WCM.  I have done 
many loom installs in Bugs and Type III's and WCM has always come out on 
top as far as ease of installation, quality of wire, and acurracy to 
stock specifications.

I have seen looms as cheap as $149.00 with WCM being the most expensive.  
In this one case you do get what you pay for, why risk it when risk of 
fire is so high as well as many thrown tools and cursing at the loom from 
the extra frustrations of the cheaper loom.

Just my opinion from experiences. ;-)

Ciao!
