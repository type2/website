Subject: Re: General Questions

&gt; My Questions
&gt;1. The gas question...is it really okay to run 87 octane?

I had pinging in Lily running 87, so I ran 89.  Figured it was cheap 
insurance.  The ex always put 87 in it, and you could tell, or at least I 
could.  Hot weather made even more difference...  I noticed that it ran 
cooler on the higher octane fuels as well. 

&gt;2. Oil-I live in sacramento, where it gets about 100 degrees on 
&gt;average in
&gt;the summer-I'm using strait 30 weight now-should I change?

Really?!?  I did too until the breakup!  Lived near 28th &amp; E.  Anyway, about 
oil in sacto, yes, you have to change oils seasonally there.  I went from 
10-40 to 20-50 Valvoline, tho I don't see what difference the brands make.  
Thought about synthetics, but the original motor came apart (GVX head failure 
- both at once) and the replacement was old, worn, and used a quart + a week, 
so I opted for the cheaper natural oil.  In the bug, I did the same thing 
(with the same oil) and it ran absollutely wonderful - strong, fast, never a 
burp.

About heat, tho... there are 3 things I recommend highly, especially living 
in the valley during the summer.  One is to make sure your cooling system is 
at 100%,  This means *all* the sheetmetal *and* seals in place (even the 
&quot;hoover bit&quot;), the heater hoses hooked and tight, the elephant ears (and the 
channels to the engine compartment) are clean, etc.,etc.  Your poor motor 
needs all the air it can get this time of year.  #2 is get a temp gague... 
one of the oil kind that sense off the pressure sensor, not the dipstick 
kind.  Bugformance has them, I think Ron (Bus Depot) does, too.  WAY 
important to make sure your motor stays cool (*especially* the heads).  I 
thought about the other type, too (that check the head temps) and may do that 
also. 

#3 is most important, tho, and kind of flows with the VW philosophy,,, take 
your time.  When it's hot, don't push your bus too hard; stop once in a while 
(like every hour or so) to let her cool for 5-10 minutes if, say, you're 
going any distance.  Again, it's all about heat - the faster you push it, the 
hotter it gets, and the hotter it gets, the closer to collapse your engine 
comes to.  You *do* have an advantage of a lighter bus (Mine's a westy) but 
still, take it easy.

&gt;3. Speed-How fast should I drive on the freeway-it screams past 60mph

Then drive slower.  If you get a tach for it (again, another good investment 
IMMHO), it should be right around 3400 tops if I remember right.  On mine, 
that put me at 58-60ish.  It had a *very* definate &quot;sweet spot&quot; it ran at, 
tho it *would* go faster - the ex used to run it at 70+ (and I think that's 
what eventually killed her - too much heat from too much speed).  You have to 
remember, also, VW vans are technically 3/4 ton trucks.  Really.  So you 
figure, they're geared lower to have more power, but run slower, too.  Add 
time to the trip, enjoy the scenery, and drive slower.
