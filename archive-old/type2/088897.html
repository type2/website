Subject: Re: [T2] cv joint replacement

Steve,
I had a bad joint in my 70, so I replaced the entire axle.
There is a place by me that specializes in CV's and they charge $79 to
repair or replace the axle.
After they work on it, they tested it and gave me a warranty.
Of course I had to remove the axle, which I had to do regardless.
To make my decision: I compared the cost of the replacement parts (about
$55), looked at the messy job, my experience, etc.
I have not had any problems, so I am a happy camper.
Later,
Jim
