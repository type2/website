Hi Derek
Problem is you cant eye ball TDC by looking at the piston. Thre is so
little piston movement at TDC that it can look like it is at TDC but it
can easily be 10-15 deg off either before TDC or afterTDC. Use the marks
unless you have a degree wheel and a modified spark plug to use as a
stop. You remove the porcelen and electrode from an old spark plug and
tap the electrode end for a stud with about 1&quot; protusion.
The modified plug is then installed in the head. Make sure the piston is
NOT near TDC when installing tne plug. The engine is then rotated by
hand until it stops against the stud. A degree wheel reading is then
taken and noted.The engine is then rotated back till it stops against
the stud and another degree wheel reading is taken. Split the difference
between the two readings and rotate the engine to the middle    and you
have a dead accurate TDC.  You can re mark the  TDC mark on t.he case if
necessary.   I have found that the VW marks are pretty close but others
can be way off.
Hope this helps, Jack
