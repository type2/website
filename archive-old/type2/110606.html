&gt; Does anyone have experiencing buying a pancake 1700 longblock?  Where is a
&gt; good place to order one from?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.   I
&gt; currently know of GEX, but have heard mixed comments about there quality.

Somebody said something positive about GEX?  Wow!

There are several competent type IV builders out there.  Jake Raby and
Boston Bob come to mind.  Remember cheap &lt;&gt; good!
