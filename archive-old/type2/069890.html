Subject: Need Advice please.....

Hi all
As I was driving my bus and thinking about all the many things
it needs, I thought maybe I should replace the engine. It is
rather weak and I am not sure of its history. The bus shows
44,XXX miles so the engine may still be the origonal, but
I somehow doubt it. I called my local VW shop that rebuilt
my type 1 engine for less than a long block from one of
the mail order companies and he said it was harder to work
on the type 4 ( mine is a 1800) and it would be about 
$2000. WOW!! that is almost double what it would cost from
a mail order company. 
        I have read all the bad experiences people have had
recently with MOFOCO and GEX. I called BUSBOYS and they reccomended
either GEX or AVP. I have never heard of AVP. Has anyone
delt with them?
        SO here is my problem, should I take the chance on a
less expensive engine mail order,? or should I hope that
someday I can afford the local guy and that my engine holds
up till then?

Well I just realized that I did explain why I think it may 
need rebuilt. Here it is
1. Top speed is about 65 on flat ground.
2. When climbing ANY grade the engine makes a chatter noise.
3. After driving it for 10 minutes, it slowly looses what
little power it had.
4. I am paraniod. :)

Well that about sums it up. Thanks for listening.........Chip
