&lt;type IV 2.0 motor&gt;
&gt;when I got the bolts out there were some sort of plastic certs on the
&gt;bolts which is obviously the reason I had to use the punch.  Do I
&gt;need to get new ones on these for the rebuild?  What are they called?

They are vibration dampners.  I think they're only found (originally) on the
2.0 motors.  Last gasket set I bought for a 2.0 has them with it.  The 1.7
gasket sets I have bought did not have them.

&gt;Also,  the front of the case started to split with a couple of hits from
&gt;the rubber hammer and the back seem to be a little more difficult.
&gt;Do I need to remove the flywheel for any reason before I split the case.

Yeah baby!  Yeahhh!!

There are 1 or maybe 2 bolts (can't remember which) behind the flywheel and
it MUST come off to access these.  Type IV flywheels are SOOO much easier
than type 1's.  Just remove those 5 bolts (torqued to 80 lbs each if I
remember right) and slip that muther off with you bare hands.  Don't loose
the funky 5-hole washer that is underneath the bolts 'cause you need it.
