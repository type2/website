Subject: Re: [T2] 76 Westy starts and dies

I have been following along this thread with interest, as I have been
having similar problems with my '79 Westy.  I just rebuilt the top end and
have been trying to get the engine tuned, but there appears to be a vacuum
leak: I can hear hissing and the engine has a hard time at normal idle
speed.  My problem is: how do I find replacement hoses that fit?  I've
been back and forth to the parts store several times, trying to find new
air hoses, but each time it seems the hose is too small or too large:
nothing seems to fit!  Unfortunately, I threw my old hoses out, so now I'm
really stuck.

Here is some advice for Lee.  First off, this morning I called a local
shop to see how busy they were (yes, I was just going to take it in, have
them deal with the vacuum, then do the smog check &amp; mixture adjustment).
They were pretty booked through the next week, but the fellow there told
me to try this: block off the brake booster line to try and eliminate that
section as the source of the problem.  The brake booster line enters the
engine compartment on the left side of the firewall and attaches to a T
fitting on the left side of the air distribution housing.  If there is no
vacuum leak once this is blocked off (at the housing), then you've now
narrowed it down to the brake booster portion of the system!

Another bit of advice (this is what I'm going to try next): get an auto
stethoscope (I tried my wife's medical stethoscope, but this only appears
to work on contact with surfaces).  You may be able to use it to find the
source of an air leak.

Good luck!  We're both in the same boat here!
