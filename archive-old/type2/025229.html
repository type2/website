Ok, it is now becoming clear that saving $100 in shipping by going UPS vs.
trucking company was not a good idea....

Oil cooler was not installed but still damaged.  Entire box was covered in
oil, I guess there must have been oil inside the case?!  It leaked out and
UPS plastic-wrapped the box somewhere in transit.

The studs for the fuel pump are real bad.  One is belt 70 degrees, the other
is broken off right at the surface.  Photo here

writing means over the generator stand area?)

Both valve covers are banged-up and had fallen off with all the beating.
One exhaust stud is bent, that is no bigge.

One head is damaged... at least it seems to me.  Th e rocker assembly (?)
has a spring compressed in about 1/2 inch.  The #1 intake.  Here is a photo
http://www.i405_dot_com/VW/stand/DamageHead1.jpg &lt; -- is this serious?  Do I
need to have the head replaced and is there any possibility of internal
engine damage from such a blow?

All help appreciated.  You know what they say about the pioneers, they are
the ones with arrows in their back :)
