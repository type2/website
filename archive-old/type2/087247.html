Subject: Re: [T2] Flooding a 2L 77 engine.

Andrew,

Did you see the posts this morning from another listeee who was having a 
similar problem...turned out to be a bad injector.

Describe the &quot;flooding&quot; problem more...after you drive how far/how 
long....gas comes out of the tail pipe?...etc...etc

How well does it start...how long will it run.....

You didn't talk about checking the pressure regulator....or checking the 
return gas lines to the gas tank...

Cheers ,dave

&gt; I have '77 T2 with the 2L fuel injected engine.  
I have been having a flooding problem for over a year now (so bad I cant drive the Bus).  
The tight vacuum system, a recently new/rebuilt mass air flow sensor.  
I have checked the cold start valve, temperature sensor in the head of the engine, 
air regulator, deceleration valve, and fuel injectors (none are leaking.)  
I would appreciate any help.

&gt; thank you
