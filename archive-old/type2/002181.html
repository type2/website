Subject: cleanin' the case
Date: Fri, 1 Jun 2001 17:55:31 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

1800 camper is the car

engine is out with heads and cylinders off for new rings and a general
inspection... my rods and bearings seem great (no deflection on either) so i
was thinking i'd just see if i could clean the case without splitting it...
muir reccomends removing the oil strainer and pressure relief valve, then
washing the outside and inside thoroughly with degreaser and a pressure
washer... kinda nervous about this as i worry about getting bits and peices
of grit inside the case that way...

any suggestions? i suppose i could always crack the case but that just seems
like more work i don't really need to do...
