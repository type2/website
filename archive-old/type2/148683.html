  Boats  Campout- near  Cincinnati  Ohio

Hi Volks,

I've never attended the Michigan show OR Buses'N'Boats, but I've  
heard very good reports on both events.  Since these events are more  
than 200 miles apart I really don't think there is a conflict here.

A successful campout is not about numbers. A friendly campfire, some  
teamwork making Breakfast Burritos and a couple buses is all it takes.


Happy trails,

Greg Potts
