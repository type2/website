Subject: Re: [T2] 1978 Westfalia

Fastest source for the wiring diagrams is a Hayes Manual, about $16.00
It normally has the Westy electrical diargrams too. Might pick one up
used from Amazon I'd also suggest that you post on the type2 for sale
site in the wanted section.
&gt; locating this documentation it would be greatly appreciated.
