Subject: re: [T2] Rear speaker placement
Cc: type2_at_type2_dot_com

In a passenger bus I would recommend using bracket mounted speakers. 
Unscrew the coat hanger knobs and the C pillars (between middle and 
rear windows and you can mount the bracket using those holes. To run 
the speaker wire (use monster flat wire) under the floor mats to a 
location below where the rear seat was. You have removed the rear 
seat have already, right? Pull the interior panels that cover the 
wheel humps. Remove the plastic screw that is on the frame below the 
window(this is a mount for a 3 point seat belt. Snake the speaker 
wire through the frame and out the hole. You will now have the least 
amount of speaker wire showing for this installation. Put everything 
back together and prepare to rock, soft rock, samba or whatever it is 
you are into.

If you have a 68 to 73 Westfalia you can do the same thing but mount 
right speaker on closet. You can remove the &quot;oh, sh!t&quot; handle and use 
that hole if you do no want to alter you cabinet.

In a passenger bus it should also be possible to mount a bracket in 
the area of the rear hatch arms and run wire behind all the panels.

I have seen several buses with 6x9 hung under the dash.

I have a stock 3 band Emden radio in the 72 bus with a single in the 
dash speaker and it rocks.
