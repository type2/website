Subject: Re: [T2] Oil pressure extension hose

Hi Folks,

&gt;The fitting in my block is not metric, it is NPT.  Anyone else?

Mine is as well.  I used 1/8&quot; NPT brass tubing, but I'd prefer to use the 
flexible hose to eliminate the pendulum effect caused by the sender towering 
over the engine.
