Subject: Replacing the shift coupler, lessons learned

	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I felt that I would  share something I learned this past weekend while =
replacing my shifter coupler for the first time...

First off, the replacement unit that I got from BAP was from Brazil and =
something that I hadn't noticed until I had the thing place on the shaft =
was that it had little to no threads! The lock screw would not go on. So =
I was forced to just use the polyurethane bushings in the original stock =
unit.

I also found that the screw/pin combo used the hold the assembly to the =
fore portion of the shift rod is a pain to remove and a new one from =
Brazil is even more difficult to put on! I reused the old unit which =
already had threads...

The third and final thing that I learned is that even though the only =
thing I effectively replaced was the urethane bushings, the shifting was =
WAY off and I could no longer hit 3rd and 4th gears. So I adjusted the =
stop plate at the bottom of the shifter by lifting up the rubber =
flooring and loosening the two bolts that hold the shifter assembly to =
the floor.

I then wiggled (technical term) the shifter around and readjusted a few =
times until everything was kosher.
