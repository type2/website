&gt;  As I was driving to a theatre audition this evening something went 
&gt; terribly,
&gt;  terribly wrong with the &quot;Big Boy&quot;.  Coming off the freeway, I downshifted
&gt;  into third gear, decelerating toward the stop light.  I pushed the in
clutch
&gt;  to drop down to second,then as I clutched out, I heard/felt something like
a
&gt;  &quot;pop&quot; and my stick went slack (no euphemism intended).  I was still in gear
&gt;  (presumably third), but I now had no
&gt;  ability to shift; the stick could be moved into any position (including
&gt;  reverse) with the clutch out, and no effect.

Hi Spencer,

Something similar happened to me (I was stuck in third while facing forward
into a blind alley). I got under the bus and tried shifting by hand but the
rod was stuck.
Before the gear box was removed the concensus was that I had broken the gear
selector carrier which is like a wide short armed U. 
When the nose cone was removed this was not the case but the rubber bushing at
the top of the selector was very worn and the end of the shift rod inside of
the nose cone had come out - effectively jamming the mechanism.

Unfortunately unless visual inspection reveals a loose mount at the front end
of the shift rod, loose connections between the parts of the shift rod or the
rear coupler damaged then its time to take the gear box out and look in the
nosecone.

While its out you have a chance to replace the shift rod bushings that sit
inside the tube holding the long central part of the shift rod. If you cann't
get them in the USA point your browser at www.justkampers.co_dot_uk. You can order
with your credit card and as the parts are light air mail will not be
expensive.

Good luck
