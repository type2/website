&gt; I concur with Clara. I've never been harassed going into Canada, but more 
&gt; often than not I have been hassled coming back into the USA.

snip!

I have to TOTALLY agree with the above sentiments. i have never been hassled 
coming back into Canada (I am a Canadian citizen) but have no end of hassle's 
getting into the States (especially if I am dumb enough to choose the Detroit 
crossing, they are by far and away the worst). It has gotten to the point where I 
don't even bother trying to cross over because of the hassle I get.

I  should mention that I do not have ampitudes of hair, shave regulary etc. (no dis 
inteneded who choose not to :), the point being that my sole crime I seem to be 
guilty of is happening to enjoy split window busses (with nary a peace sign, dove 
or rainbow coloured paint job to be seen). It seems that US border patrol cannot 
differentiate between this important nuance and consider me to be a relic of the 
60's intent on shipping copious amount of mind altering substances into the USA. I 
mean come on if I was intent on doing that don't they think I would be at least 
chooising a less conspicuous (and faster!) mode of transport?? For referenece 
whenever I drive my rusty Japanese car across the border, no problema!

&lt;rant modde off&gt; I hope that travellers to Inuvik don't get hassled by Canadian 
customs. :(
