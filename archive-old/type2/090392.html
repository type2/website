Subject: Re: [T2] Grinding into first

&gt; I am having a difficult time with the transmission in
&gt; my '72.  When I shift into first from a stop, it
&gt; grinds.  I can downshift into first when moving
&gt; forward slightly without any difficulty or grinding.
&gt; Also, when downshifting to second, it doesn't always

I would check the clutch adjustment first.
Also did you notice any change in the feel of the clutch when this
problem started?
Point is I would first make sure its not a clutch problem first before
suspecting the tranny.
