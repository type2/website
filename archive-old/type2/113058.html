Subject: Re: [T2] '78 decel valve

Diagnosing my daughter's 75 - I had vacuum leak woes (you could hear
hissing) I did notice that when the valve was not in the picture (remove
its source of manifold vac and plug the ends) it would do the little
backfires and drop rpms quickly when you revved it up and let go.  The
vac leak turned out to be both an intake boot and a very subtle crack in
the distr. hose- the latter became obvious when I did a strobe test and
wondered why the max vac advance went to 28, not the usual
40-45.....first thought it was a sticking condition of the weights (idle
timing kept changing)!
