Subject: Re: [T2] Welding Body Panels- To Overlap or Not?

You can use flanging pliers and lap. I do most of mine butt welding but it
also depends on where is at, some times i lap for extra support and
strength. Butt welding is alot harder to master,,,geez that looks bad in
type ,,,roflmao. Try it both ways on some scrap see which works best for
you. Later
