&gt; Wow. Had a really interesting morning...
&gt;
&gt; Wife came up to me asking when the bus was going to be sold. I
&gt; explained there was only one person from this list who had expressed
&gt; an interest, and that I hadn't really made any efforts to advertise
&gt; it. I didn't even have a ForSale sign up.
&gt;
&gt; She actually BEGGED me to keep it!
&gt;
&gt; I was stunned, and told her so. She said she really liked it and it
&gt; was worth losing me a day a week working on it. Well, how could I say
&gt; no to that? So we're keeping it. :-)
&gt;
&gt; I want to thank all of the listees who helped remind me why I bought
&gt; the bus in the first place, and talked me into waiting a bit before
&gt; selling. I guess it took a week for my wife to get up the nerve to
&gt; intrude on &quot;my&quot; domain (cars). I've saved all your wonderful emails
&gt; and am printing them out and putting them in a folder to keep in the
&gt; bus as a reminder of what being a bus owner is all about.
