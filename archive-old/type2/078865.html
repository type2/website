Subject: Re: [T2] Thermostat?


Someone a few weeks ago said they had some. I'm sorry but I don't remember
who it was. However, it is not at all difficult to adapt a T-1 t-stat. All
you need is a screw to fit it and drill a hole in the head to attach the
wire with a crimped sleeve, like maybe just a criped elec. term. Function
nominal.

&gt;About six months ago it was discovered that T4 thermostats were NLA. 
&gt;Has anyone found a new source?
