Hi,

I've just bought my first VW! It's a UK spec, 1977 Devon camper with a 2.0L,
twin carb engine - that's about all I know, I'd welcome any comments on what
to look out for with this model bus.

It has done 93,000 miles but the first problem is an oil leak that only seems
to occur on the road but it drips onto the exhaust somewhere and creates an
awful stink in the cabin. Any common causes I can investigate? 

I want to get it ready for a 6 week spin round europe next month and will be
changing oil, plugs, points &amp; filters - anything else to consider?

Cheers,




Cosmo
