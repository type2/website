&gt;If you have suffered a Type IV valve seat problem, give us a quick outline
&gt;of service history, milage, experience, etc. Check the Bentley. Does it show
&gt;a procedure for valve seat replacement??? I think not. It doesn't mean you
&gt;can't experiment and try another method. How many have had cracks welded and
&gt;seats replaced???? How long did the fix last???? The machinist who did the
&gt;work. Was he considered a masterful craftman by community report???
&gt;Was an annealing oven involed??? Just a solid journeyman??? Knew those Chevy
&gt;heads gooder than anybody around BUT???
&gt;
&gt;Include a report please if you have owned same and NEVER had such problems.
&gt;Tell us about your service history, milage, experience.

I have put about 100k on my bus with five different sets of heads and never
had a valve seat drop.

Set #1 was what were on the bus when I got it.  History unknown.  Exhaust
valve broke off but the valve seats did not budge.

Set #2 was a set of 1700 heads rebuilt by a local machine shop with lots of
A/C VW experience.  Those heads were doomed by a spark plug thread insert
that came out.

Set #3 was from the junkyard, nice-appearing set of 1700 heads, history
unknown.  I put in new exhaust valves and ran them until I sold that engine.

Set #4 was a pair of GEX rebuilt 1800 heads.  Put about 55,000 miles on
them despite problems from the very beginning with munged spark plug
threads and stripped air injection port threads.

Set #5 is currently on the bus - they are 1700 heads rebuilt by Mark
Stephens with a stage one job done on the combustion chambers (unshrouding,
polishing).  No problems, 11,000 miles and counting.  I expect to have
these heads for a long, long time.
