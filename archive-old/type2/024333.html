My problem is when I start it in gear with clutch depressed, it tries 
&gt; to move! I start it in neutral and try and move, it is hard to get in gear.  

You have either a streched clutch cable or the bracket for the 
flex tube at the trans is loose or the bulkhead where the cable
enters the tube is failing (rust, ect). Also check the cross shaft
bearings for wear. The clutch is not fully releasing so it is an
adjustment problem. Do check the sag of the bowden tube for spec.
