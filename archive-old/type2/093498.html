Subject: 1971 Bus Going to Scrapper in San Diego

I just received notice that the AQMD will be sending a 1971 Bus to the 
scrappers.  It is scheduled to arrive on July 6th.
You can make an appointment with mailto:cbennett_at_arb_dot_ca_dot_gov

Its in San Diego CA

PLEASE Be NICE to this guy.  He is trying to help the hobbyists by sending 
out this information.  He was NOT the not one that made the decision to 
scrap the bus.

Since it's a '71, I figure that there might be a few '71 bus owners out 
there that will have a chance to pick up some '71 only pieces.

I don't know whether you have to take the whole bus or just parts, but an 
email will answer any questions you might have.

Remember, time is of the essence
