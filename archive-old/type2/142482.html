Subject: Re: [T2] [long] broken clutch cable, clevis pin wear, the dumb
  previous owner...

Hey Guys   That is normal wear for one of those pins.  It helps if you grease 
them.  As for the plate that the pin hooks to you can flip it over or weld 
and grind it to new.  In a pinch you can use a hardened bolt with two nuts but 
you have to leave it free to pivot which is why two nuts so one acts as a lock 
nut for the other  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
