I am amazed and fulfilled when I read the Diversity of the list...and I
wonder...if we are of the &quot;short wick&quot;, ie, material to work with, on an
individual basis, what will be next, as in &quot;repro&quot;, and &quot;rebuild&quot;, and then I
see &quot;Subies&quot;, etc , and I think that &quot;Buses&quot;, for whatever purpose, will
exist, no matter the reason, some mobile, some &quot;cemented&quot;, but there will
always be a &quot;few&quot;, who remember, and appreciate, what they were for &quot;them&quot;,
and what they have now, and then, I remember, how great &quot;groups&quot; are!  I am on
my way to a funeral for a dear friend,  and thought I would emote, before I
go.  I profusly appologize for my rant!
