Subject: AC w/o Motor Compressor?

Folks this is going to sound crazy, and I wish I had taken pictures.  Has
anyone ever seen a VW Bus AC unit without a motor mounted Compressor?  I
bought a set of 40mm Dellorto off of a Bus in the Junkyard.  This thing had
a AC unit that had the ducts and controls overhead in a console that ran
from the front of the Bus to about mid way back. It had a tag that said
Volkswagen on it.  I could see a condenser and I believe dryer mounted under
the Bus and some lines, also some type of motor.  But the Bus engine showed
no signs of having a Compressor on it.  Anyone ever seen anything like this.
I had my mother call the Junkyard (it's in another state) and they said
they'd take $75 for the unit.  I'll be making a trip back up that way next
month.

Dave
