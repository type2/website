Subject: Re: Carb blowers..will this work ?

But could you ever more enough CFM's? Doubt a little squirrel cage fan 
could do it.

However, I have a heard bits of a story where some 914 guys (I think) 
supercharged their motor with a pair of leaf blowers!

&gt;&lt;&lt;More total air through the motor is what makes more power, just a cam

&gt;I've been wondering about doing something. I have a really strong heater
&gt;blower motor that I was wondering what would happen if I mounted it on
&gt;top of my single 2 bbl Weber carb and drove with it on.
&gt;
&gt;Crazy ..... but will it work ?
&gt;
&gt;What do 'ya think ?
