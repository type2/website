Subject: auto tranny switch

   Hello all, I don't have the free time to convert my 74 auto into a manual. 
 But would like to switch my 74 autotranny with a 77 autotranny.  Has anyone 
done this, the two trannys look very different when lying side by side on the 
ground.  I am concerned that tranny mounts will not match up.  Has anyone 
done this? and if so could you pass along any tips my way.   The reason for 
the switch is 1. the current tranny doesn't shift properly and leaks ATF and 
2. I have a 77 auto rotting away out back.  I picked up the 77 for parts and 
the new tranny and didn't realize the two were different :0.  
Thanks, Marcus
