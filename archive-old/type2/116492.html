The high turn signals and rectangular vents on your westie suggest
to me that it is a later model than 1970.  I only point this out
because those sweet lookin BRM's state on that Cip1 page, that they
will fit the bolt pattern of a T2 up to 1970.  Or are you running
hubs with an older lug bolt pattern?  I've got the same issues with
my buses and have been considering getting the drums re-machined so
that I can run something other than stock rims.
