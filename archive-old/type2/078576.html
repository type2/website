Once again a rude list member has to ruin the moment.

Many of us are on this list because we need a little basic advice.  And =
we
are thankful for this list and that advice.  Myself, I am new to VW's =
and
most things mechanical.  Ask me to rewire your house, no problem.
But fix that slipping tranny?  Not a clue.  So I, like many others, come
to this list to get answers.  Again, I am thankful for the help.

And every once in a while some newbie, like me, comes to the list
happy, relieved, maybe a bit excited because he dropped his first =
engine,
rebuilt her first carb, fix a pop top, purchased their first bus, or =
even got
the paint to not look like crap.  And what happens?!?!?  Some big mouth
has to come along and tell us everything we did wrong and how it's just
going to break again tomorrow. =20

Well, I have 2 words for you, ....... but unfortunately I still have =
some
respect for the list, so I won't post those 2 words.

You had your opportunity to reply the original question, which you =
didn't.

And now you refer to me as a &quot;DPO.&quot;  Not a PO but DPO.  Now that is=20
just plain rude.

Dave Wolfanger, your opinions are no longer welcome in my book.

To the rest of the list, I whole-hearted apologize if I have offended=20
any of you.  It was surely not my intention.  But I needed to say it.

&gt;you are now the future DPO

&gt;due to poor adhesion and other problems. The
&gt;sanding scratches will appear soon as the paint
&gt;cures, if not there already.=20
