&gt; 	Last summer I installed an aux. oil cooler in my '74 westy to

&gt; Should it PULL the air from the small pocket above the cooler through 
&gt; the cooler, therebye SUCKING the heat away from the cooler,
&gt; Or should it PUSH the ambient air from under the bus through the 
&gt; cooler and up into the pocket above the cooler?

most all systems SUCK so it probably works better

&gt; 	I think my problem is that small area above the cooler. It 
&gt; seems too small to pull air from, and too small to push air into. Air 

air molecules are quite small, they won't have any problems with the
space, that is about the same as what is used on Air Cond coils
