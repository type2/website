Hi everybody,
In the past you guys have a great help so I need it once again.  I have
been trying over the past few days to get my
engine going
Stats:
1600dp(100 cam), 009, dual weber 40 dcnfs, bugpack header w, single
quiet pack, otherwise stock.
Everything is bolted up and seems fine.  The engine is timed to 7.5deg
btdc and I have double checked all ignition components with the Idiots
guide.  I am getting spark to the cylinders at the right time.  All I
can seem to get is a pop when I spray starting fluid in the carbs and
not even all the time.  I just realized now that I should have done a
compression check also.  But other than low compression what could be
the cause of my problem.  I realize that it could be several things so I
hope I gave enough information.  Many thanks in advance.  Brian 71 westy
