Subject: re Battery drain...
Content-Disposition: inline



It sounds as though you may be running low on ideas for your battery
draining.  If nothing the rest of the list has suggested pans out you may
want to check the starter solenoid.  I have heard of people having bad
solenoids that caused the battery to drain over time.  In the meantime you
should get yourself a battery quick disconnect.  This attaches itself
between the battery post and the cable.  There will be a plastic capped nut
or a lever that you turn to make the connection in the cable.  This is not
a fix, but it will provide you a very usable workaround until you trace the
problem.  The ones I have are Gold in color with a Green nut assembly, and
cost less than 5$.  You would have to give it a quick spin closed to drive,
and a quick spin open to save your battery.  I have been using these for
about 4 years now with no ill effects on cars in storage.  The bus is
probably the easiest vehicle to use this on as you can open the boot
without having to enter the car first.  I always see these for sale at swap
meets and in the back of magazines (overpriced).

Good luck
Graham
