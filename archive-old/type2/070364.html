FWIW, my brand-new engine definitely needs to have the heads/cylinders
retorqued after a few hundred miles.  The lower studs (accessible by
removing the rocker arms) were all loose when I checked them at around
500 miles.  I've been putting off the full retorquing because for me,
it means mostly disassembling it, since the upper studs are hidden by
the tin (the fan housing was a real pain last time, and I doubt it'll
be any better this time).
