Subject: RE: [T2] poptop canvas

I have one on my '75 and I think the quality is better than OEM.  I've sung
the praises of Dawn's workmanship many times on this list.  When I bought it
three or four years ago, I found it to be by far the best value out there.
I haven't priced them since.

The canvas(sunbrella) will almost certainly outlast my van, which is
languishing on the side of my house...
