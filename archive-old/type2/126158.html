Subject: Re: [T2] Thinking of XM satellite radio.

(Sent the last copy from the wrong address -- it's gonna bounce on the
list)
I'm using Sirius Satellite because I got a deal on the hardware (got
tuner plus 1 cradle free).
.
It is SO cool to be able to listen to the same radio stations on a
2000+ mile drive. I have a cradle in the Ch*vy truck and one in my
office at work. Neither bus is running right now but they will have
cradles added also. I have one for the house just don't have it set up
yet (too lazy to climb up and put the antenna on the roof).
.
The tuner is 12V so before I wired the truck I used a set of nice 12V
computer speakers and plugged both into the accessory socket. Makes a
REAL nice portable sound system.
.
Same caveats as any other satellite system. If you live around a lot
of tall buildings or &quot;thick cover&quot; type trees then expect cut-outs as
the signal gets lost.
.
