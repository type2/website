Subject: VW Heritage???

&gt; This won't help you find the part you're after but what I've found really
&gt; useful is a parts book with drawings and numbers on. VW Heritage do them -
&gt; mine was only 6 pounds about 2 years back, and these are the same pics that
&gt; VW dealers have on microfiche. If you get stuck I'll fax you the page. Then
&gt; armed with a proper designation you may have more luck when you come to ask
&gt; around.
&gt;

Andy,

This document is not available (that I know of) on this side of the
pond.  Do you have contact/ordering info?

TIA
