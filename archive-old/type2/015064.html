&gt;I'd be concerned if you see anything as high as 350F for any length of time.
&gt;Heads are heated to 350F to press in the valve seats; hence, the seats could
&gt;loosen above 350F. 

That's what I get for saving time by not being specific (and my students
would love that: they call me Dr. Precision).  What I should have said was:
Generally, the hotter an engine runs the better, up to the point where
things start to go wrong. In a water-cooled engine, that's where the
coolant starts to boil, about 225 with glycol and a pressurized system.  In
an aircooled, 325 to 350 is a respectable running temperature.  If I am
driving in hot weather and climbing mountains, and the temp gets around
400, I watch it like a hawk.  If I get a downgrade and it cools down, which
it generally does, I don't worry about it. If it's around 400 for more than
a minute, I stop and let it cool off.
