&gt; The Chevy has a 4.8 liter vortec V-6 moter and a good receiver
&gt; hitch set-up on it.

In my book that should do it. Two years ago I towed a '78 VW bus on a
trailer with my '81 diesel vanagon (1600 cc, 4 cylinder, 50 horses!).

However I don't think I would do that again. No need to, I can now use my
1900 cc Eurovan (with a whopping 60 horses, that's about 15 years of
progress!!!)

You can read it on my website http://www.hrps_dot_demon.nl/jwbus/lxb-bus.htm

Have fun,
