&gt; I would like to hear from folks as to some good donor front seats to go
&gt; into my 72.
&gt;   
&gt;   What luck have most had getting seats out of another vehicle?
&gt;   
&gt;   What would be good ones to look for?
&gt;

   Sadly, at 6' 1&quot;, I'm already lookin' thru' the top of the
windshield...Some seats
(notwithstanding the effort to fit 'em to the stock tracks) are just too tall
in the
saddle... ;-(
