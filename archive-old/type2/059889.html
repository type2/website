Because I knew the pitman arm was aligned correctly on the steering box
shaft and that the steering wheel was correctly aligned when the box was
at the middle of its range, I figured the adjustment point had to be
either in the drag link and/or the tie rods.  I adjusted the drag link
to center the steering wheel but when I tried turning the wheel
lock-to-lock, I noticed that turning left was limited by the box travel,
turning right was limited by the wheel stop!  Tomorrow I'll return the
drag link to its original position and go to work on the tie rod
adjustment.  This is all such fun! :-(

Just for a change of focus I replaced a torn CV joint boot (did both
ends of the drive shaft while it was out).  I guess I got lucky -- all
the parts were in good condition and the job went smoothly.  Without a
doubt though, one of the dirtiest maintenance jobs I've tackled yet.

Thanks again for all the feedback.  This is a great learning experience
for me and I hope others benefit as well.
