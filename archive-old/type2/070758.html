If the speedometer works, it's not the cable....
the speedo head is bad...
but for review:
under the left front wheel cover you will find a small, square shaft
protruding from the center of the hub..it should have a small clip on it.maybe
some chewing gum and like that, too..not there? just a square hole?  you found
the problem!...
cable end is in the hole?...ok..slide under the bus at the front..the cable
comes out of the center of the back of the drivers side wheel and curves
forward to the very back of the spare tire carrier...right there is a little
black box with a rubber plug/wire thing plugged in the front...the cable goes
in the back and another cable comes out the front and dissappears up past the
spare tire...go up to the drivers seat (dust off the ants and pine needles)
grasp the back of the back of the plastic cover over the speedo and clock with
both hands a pull sharply up and back...*HEY*! the cover comes off!..there
*should* be a clear-ish plastic sheet over the top of the gauges and under the
brake fluid cap..lift up on the plastic and peek behind the speedo...the 80'
could be either a while plastic or a shiny metal connector on the cable, but
either should be stuck *firmly* to the back of the speedo....and that's the
tour....now, check to see if the speedo works, and, how to replace the
offending part will follow, *if* the speedo doesn't work....but I'll bet it
does.....
Yes, it is possible for repair the speedo head.....but I'll have to walk you
through that one....
