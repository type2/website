Chest to see if there are spacers on the shock bolts if necessary.  Just
fixed this recently on a vanagon....PO put aftermarket shocks and omitted
spacers, and shocks could move side to side along mounting bolts.

&gt; &gt;It's coming from the rear and sounds EXACTLY like when  the rear
&gt; &gt;hatch is not closed tightly (not the case) - a loud  annoying rattling
&gt; &gt;when I hit a bump. I had my wife drive while I climbed in the back -
&gt; &gt;still couldn't isolate sound. This started about a month ago.
&gt;
&gt; Check your rear shock mounting bolts (top and bottom).  Last Winter I had
an
&gt; odd thump that would come anytime I hit a bump or a sizeable crack in the
&gt; road.  Drove me crazy for a couple of days.  I finally found the left rear
&gt; lower shock mount bolt very loose.
