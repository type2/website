Subject: Re: [T2] leak down test


&gt; The test was performed with the piston at the bottom of the cylinder
&gt; and the valves closed.

Strange.....every leakdown test I have ever down is always with the piston at
TDC. Sun used to supply a whistle so you could rotate the engine to TDC and
the whistle would toot. It was a bear holding it at TDC. As you applied air,
it would push the piston down if you were a tad before or after.
