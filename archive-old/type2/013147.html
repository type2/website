If you want to paint over POR-15, you have to coat it with one of their products called &quot;Tie-Coat Primer&quot;.  It's designed to be used over POR-15 without having to sand it, and then you can top-coat with any automotive paint you want to use.

&gt;topcoated with POR paint or other quality automotive products.
&gt;
&gt;How well does POR take topcoating? I understand it's very difficult to sand.
