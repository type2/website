Subject: Standard or Automatic?

Hey all,

This is likely a subjective question, but...what would you recommend? I have a 
73, 1800 engine that I'm putting into my 72 (which is presently a 1500 type 1 
engine). While the engines are out, I'm thinking about putting the automatic 
tranny from the 73 into the 72 (which is presently a standard). How 
successful will a swap be without too much tinkering? Any potential pitfalls? 
I have read that the left and right axles are different sizes on the 
automatic and I imagine they're shorter than the axles on a standard so I'll 
have to swap the axles, too? 

The problem is that I do not know what condition the automatic tranny is in. 
Also, one of the CV joint boots on the automatic was warn off and the joint 
may not be in great shape.

And the final BIG question...how happy will I be with the performance of the 
automatic? How reliable is it?
