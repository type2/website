Anybody got an on-line link to the article?

Thanks for the info Corbett.


&gt;Their is a whole article in the new VW trends this month (July) about the
&gt;trademark issues with VWoA. I have not read it, but am getting ready to.
&gt;They interviewed a lawyer for VWoA for their answers to why they are
&gt;screwing up all the aircooled business. Just thought I would let everybody
&gt;know.
