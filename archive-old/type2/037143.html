Subject: Re: por-15 tie-coat primer

I just finished using POR-15 on my bus with GREAT success, or so it seams
now, only time will tell if rust NEVER comes back, but probably not in my
life time.

As for the tie coat primer, do like I did and save your money. I applied
three coats of por-15 and about two hours after the last coat spayed primer
over the por-15. The next day I sanded the places till they where dull and
eventually painted my Pastel White over the top of it. No problems what so
ever with the paint sticking. I did have a few places where the primer
cracked over the por-15, but in these places it didn't matter if the paint
stuck , however it stuck just fine.

If I'm not mistaken the tie coat primer is good if you have a area where the
por-15 had actually dried.

&gt;      Hello all, a quick question about por-15 tie coat primer.  Is anyone
&gt; using tie-coat primer or can you just sand and use regular primer?
