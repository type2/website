&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt; 
&gt; Having read so many great accounts of this year's EveryBus has made me 
&gt; envious of all who attended.  I really wanted to go, but couldn't find the 
&gt; time or the money to make it from Aspen, Colorado (unlike the gent who made 
&gt; it from Texas!).
&gt; 
&gt; I've been looking on the various VW Events lists, but have found few 
&gt; gatherings close by (within a 9-12hr drive in my '79), so I thought I would 
&gt; start my own!  It's just at the Big Idea stage at this point, but I think it 
&gt; could work -- if I could just figure out how to make it work.  If anybody 
&gt; has any experience with organizing this sort of thing, please contact me 
&gt; with suggestions, pitfalls, things to look forward to, things to look out 
&gt; for, etc.

Talk to John Howard and Ronnie about that!  They could give you an
education!

Bus outings range from very structured to very informal.  If you want to
do the organized event thing, you will need to arrange a venue,
facilities, finances, relations with the locals, etc.  

If you keep it
informal you could just publicise &quot;let's meet at [location] on [date]&quot; and
see who shows up!  Nobody's really in charge, which may be better from a
liability standpoint :)

Both types of event are fun.
