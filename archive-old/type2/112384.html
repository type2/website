Subject: Anybody in eastern Australia with a digital camera?

Hi all,
     I live in the states and am looking at purchasing a bus in Australia. The owner has one picture on the website, but I was hoping to get more photos and have a second opinion on its condition. Is anybody willing to check out a bus for me? Here's where it's located:
I am located in a small village named 
&quot;Gravesend&quot; which is near the New South Wales/Queensland border. Approx 8.5 
hour drive north-west of Sydney or 7.5 hours drive south-west of Brisbane.

If anybody is near there and is willing to do this for me, I'm more than willing to do something nice for them! Feel free to define nice or if you need any VW parts, especially 78ish I can help (or whatever).

Thanks,
John Tracy

Far away from Australia in Chattanooga, Tennessee.
