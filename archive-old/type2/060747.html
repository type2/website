Subject: RE: ? good way to clean camper top

&gt;Along with ideas on cleaning a bus, does anyone have ideas on 
&gt;cleaning the WESTFALIA top.  I just got a 72 and the fiberglass 
&gt;is dirty.  Will strong cleaners be a problem with the rubber seals?

X-14 tile stain &amp; mildew remover.  You can get it just about anywhere
that has a good selection of home cleaning products.  This stuff works
great and won't kill you in the process.  Just squirt it on to a section
of the roof (how ever much of it you can reach at one time), let it sit
for a minute and then scrub it vigorously with a brush.  I rinse each
section as I go so the stuff doesn't sit on my paint for too long.
