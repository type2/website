&gt; The head of choice is an AMC, and looks pretty darn new. My problem is, I
&gt; don't understand the nuances of the Type 4, so when I stare at the head, I
&gt; don't see any &quot;shim&quot; cast into the cumbustion chamber, as I was told there


&gt; How do I know how much to shim? Do I need to shim? What's the difference
&gt; between a shim and a gasket, in real life, not the lab?  I have just been
&gt; told of a possible shim under the cylinder as well, that might alter the

shim is under the cyl gasket is above the cyl.

the type 4 and in fact all VW air cooled engines have a seperate cyl that
can be pulled off the engine. unlike a &quot;traditonal&quot; engine

&gt; amount of shimming required at the head, but I had no intention of doing
&gt; anything more than just swapping the head. Please don't tell me to do lots
&gt; of other stuff while I am in there :-) I can't right now.


won't been there done that.


personally I would pull the old head which can be done with engine still
in the bus but much easier with engine out. your call.

having just gone thru head hell what I would do is measure the old one if
you can, and the new one. if you don't have the skills or tools then for a
&quot;Rough&quot; quick and dirty job (I've had em last 5-8 years like that, but no
warranties either)

if the old head comes off and it has gaskets, I would use gaskets on the
new one.
if the old head has a step and the new one doesn't I would use a gasket.
if the old head has no gasket and looks like the new one I would put it
back on the same way,
if there is a shim under the cyl I would use a shim under the cyl.

unless you take the other head off you won't be able to balance the engine
anyway. the VW type 4 engine is pretty tough.

my opinon is getting the head torqued down exactly right is critical. so
if you don't have a torque wrench buy beg borrow or steal one(well skip
the steal part)

where are you located?

good luck.
