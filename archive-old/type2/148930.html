&gt;Usually, the cable breaks right at the point it meets the solid section just as you step down on the clutch

That makes sense given the hole where the grease gun is supposed to be applied. What is the wisdom on this? Lube it to begin with because Bentely says only to lube if the cable is stiff. That to me implies that you let it rub in the first place which I'd think you'd want to avoid.

&gt;Then the cable gets sucked into the bowden tube. If you still have the threaded end with the wing nut, 
&gt;how much cable is left at the threaded end?

I installed a new cable (Gemo) 2+ years ago. The adjustment was somewhere in the middle of the threads. When I had my flywheel step cut and installed a new clutch disc, the same cable had to be threaded almost all the way in. The replacement cable (also Gemo) is in the same position even with the new Bowden tube.

This makes sense to me because the deeper flywheel and new clutch disc have bent the fingers on the pressure plate more towards the engine. I also replaced the release breaing but it didn't see so much thicker that it would make up for difference.

&gt;The weak point is where the wing nut pivots. Not enough grease 
&gt;there and the cable bends instead of pivoting. Then the cable snaps.

Thanks for this insight Karl. This time around I lubed up the thread on the cable with grease and well as the acorn nut and lever and the nut was much easier to turn. The last time I didn't lube the threads and it was a pain to adjust.

&gt;I have found that the new replacement bowden tubes are crap. Try to save your old one.

My new bowden tube is Gemo. It seems the same as the original except that the plastic pieces are now made of metal:

They look like they are different lengths in the photo but it's only because one of the plastic bits pulled off and wouldn't go back on.

&gt;You probably cannot 
&gt;pull the broken cable out of it? Unfortunately, if you keep trying, the cable binds completely and you will 
&gt;never save the tube. Before you try to pull it out, try to push back out the rear. Then cut the cable on the 
&gt;front end of the tube. 

Unfortunately mine broke right in the middle and caught on the plastic sleeve inside:
