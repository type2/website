Subject: Re: [T2] Re: 72 bus on the samba

While Working in the back of my 74 bus, I closed the
sliding door without attaching the inside handle
first. It was in the middle of the summer and I had to
climb over it to the front seat. It is &quot;doable&quot;, but
not very comfortable for a clumbsy guy like myself.;)
It didn't help that my front seat was full of inside
panels. 

Have a great day!
