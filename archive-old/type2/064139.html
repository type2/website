Subject: M-Code location for 62 flip seat Westy

     
     I have a 1962 &quot;flip seat&quot; Westfalia camper.  I'm told it's an S034 
     Westfalia interior.  I'm curious about finding the VW model code 
     plate.  I tried to follow the directions on the NEATO web page but I 
     still haven't found a model plate.  
     
     In my bus, there is no wall behind the front seat dividing the cab 
     from the cargo area.  The front seat back flips over to the face the 
     interior of the bus when camping.  The camper is based on a 62 
     walkthrough and was picked up in Germany in 1962 by my father in law.
     
     I've asked a number of people if there is a model plate and where it's 
     located and haven't gotten an answer.  I've looked everywhere I can 
     think of that doesn't require removing the interior.  Can anyone point 
     me at it?
