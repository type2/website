Subject: Re: [T2] CONTINUED  78 air leak..no seal between throttle body and air distributor....




&gt; Ok, ummm..what seal???  Finally got the throttle body off, which was
&gt; filthy, but there was no seal at all !!  Now, from what I have heard I
&gt; am supposed to have one.  Should this one be considered special for any
&gt; reason?  Got a part number for the seal from another list member.  Do I
&gt; go with that?  And does it matter what I clean all this with?

I looked at your pics but none show the throttle housing removed from the
plenum. If #158 is correct and you have the idle adjustment out that
far....you have a problem. Normally the head of the screw is flush with the
body.
You need to remove the 2 phillips head screws and remove the housing. The
black rubber seal is under it. It is tapered.


Thanks.
&gt; Check the pics at www.wicals_dot_com/troy/vw/images/airleak      Images
&gt; compressed this time  :-)  The date thing should be fixed now also.
