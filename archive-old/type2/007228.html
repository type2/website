For people who have asked, it is a '72 westy micro-bus.  I think the problem
is definetly the fuel pump.  Anyone have any suggestions of mechanical vs.
electronic?

Also sometimes I have some erratic accel/decel could this be due to a fuel
problem maybe, or should I invest in an eletronic ignition, or could it be
either, or both.

Thanx,
Shawn
