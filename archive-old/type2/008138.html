  A friend of mine had someone else do the
&gt; whole thing from scratch in his '70 Westy and I believe it cost him around
&gt; $1,800.  Ouch

I've been curious about doing it to my '69 camper.  I was thinking of using the compressor parts from a late '70s super beetle's ac, and making a wooden blower unit from scratch to mount on the ceiling.  

I looked into mounting a camper ac on my roof in the rear cargo area, but aparently those units are all 120volt.

I would be very interested in hearing how your friend installed ac into his '70 westy.

John.
