&gt; &gt; This is good to know as I will be doing this on my 78 2l 1-2 side shortly.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; has anyone had good luck putting this back together with the copper
&gt; &gt; 8mm nuts?
&gt;
&gt; Dave,
&gt;
&gt; I am sorry to say that my experience with the copper nuts was not a happy
&gt; one.  I found and bought a box of what were labeled &quot;copper exhaust nuts&quot;
&gt; and used a bunch of them over time.  These nuts *looked* like they were
&gt; copper and had a slit cut in from the side and were crimped to make them
&gt; locking.  When I came back to one of those systems a year or so later, the
&gt; nuts were quite rusty and not the joy to remove I expected :-(  When I
&gt; took a file to one of the nuts I had in the box, they turned out to be
&gt; copper *clad* nuts and once the copper burned off, they rusted like
&gt; the steel they were.  VW recommends copper nuts and I would say it was a
&gt; good idea, but make sure that they are copper thru and thru!
&gt;
&gt; As I said in my previous post, I have had good luck with stainless nuts
&gt; and bolts on the exhaust for my '80 Vanagon.   Metric stainless fittings
&gt; are not easy to find, but worth the effort!
&gt;
&gt; If I could find them (so far, no luck), I would say the ultimate in
&gt; corrosion resistance in the situation we are dealing with would be
&gt; silicon-bronze nuts.  Alas, I have not seen thes in metric thread here in
&gt; the states :-(((
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I plan to use the hot wax method to get mine off as espoused by Bill May
&gt; &gt; over on the vintagevw list.
&gt;
&gt; Say on! Say on!  What is this hot wax method?  If you have a copy handy,
&gt; or can convince Mr. May to do it, please post this.  More information is
&gt; better :-)
