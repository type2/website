Subject: was No Juice&gt;&gt;now clicking CV

Thank you to everyone that helped in the no juice dilemma.  Appears to be a
battery issue.

Next problem, I have a serious clicking form the rear.  I have heard that it
is the CV probably.  I am unclear how to isolate.
Would this be repairable or just replaceable.
If a replacement is due, would a CV axle from a standard fit an automatic??
This is a 78 automatic.

Thank you in advance.

Kind Regards,
