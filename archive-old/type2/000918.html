&gt;&gt;Can anyone diagnose my problem?  My 77 withnewly rebuilt engine has 20
feet
&gt;&gt;on it (0 miles) and I cant get it to go any farther. I am told to keep the

Trying to drive a new engine at 'medium speed' right away is a silly thing
to even say! You need to get it running and idling well before driving it at
all. You convey some intense frustration in your post - you're not alone -
we've all been there. Try to keep a positive attitude - and more importantly
make sure you are thorough and methodical about solving your problem.

If it's firing and running at all, the timing is probably pretty close.
'77's are timed at 7 BTDC with a stock configuration. Don't forget to double
check your firing order. 1-4-3-2 right? This order is clockwise viewing
distributor from the top.

Any time all the intake stuff is removed/replace on an engine, the most
common problem by far (IMHO) is vacuum leaks. A vacuum leak would give just
the symtoms that your describe. They can occur in a million places so I'll
just enumerate the ones that come to mind. Your also didn't mention if you
have FI or a carb.

*Intake manifold to head
*Intake manifild boots.
*Brake vacuuum assist line (** the most common problem **).
*(FI only) Boot from throttle body to Mass Air Flow sensor.
*(FI only) Aux air plumbing and decel valve plumbing.
*etc,
*etc,

Try simplifying the system if you have problems finding the culprit(s).
Remember that you may have multiple leaks. Your can take the Aux Air and
Decel Valve and Brake hose out of the picture by disconnecting and covering
all open nubs with duct tape ( Make sure you do this in a way that the tape
won't get sucked into the air distributor, etc). Keep trying - be
persistant. If you get it to the point where it will run with the throttle
cracked a bit, try spraying some carb cleaner at possible leak sights - if
the engine revs up then your have found a vacuum leak.

Gook luck! Post with more details if you have any (FI or carb, for instance)
