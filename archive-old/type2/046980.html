Mr. Baldwin is exactly correct.  Living as I do in a row house, &quot;dump&quot;
never means &quot;on the ground&quot; as I have to live with my mistakes and I like
to garden way too much to risk creating a dead zone in my 10x10 lawn :-)

There are things I do not do at home because they are too hazardous.  It
turns out that carb cleaning, at least using Chem-Clean, is one of them.
The actual can will be disposed of properly (we have a &quot;hazardous&quot; pickup
twice a year here).
