Subject: Re: [T2] Fixing Oil Leak



&gt;Is there any way to stop oil seepage from the seam between the case halves?

If it is indeed 'seepage' from between the case halves, anything short of a 
teardown is iffy.  Permatex makes a sealant that is just for this purpose, 
but I can't attest to its efficacy, since I've never used it myself.  If you 
deduce that it isn't your mainseal leaking, try it out and let us all know 
what you think.

	Eron
