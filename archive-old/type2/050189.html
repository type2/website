&gt; I was told by a local body guy that most modern paints are not compatible with
&gt; lead filler and to either remove it or find primer specifically for lead
&gt; filler. THe &quot;shade tree mechanic&quot; on tnn also said this in one episode.  I
&gt; have also seen a new filler made up of aluminum but have heard nothing about
&gt; it, anyone heard anything about this?

Hmmm...I just went to my Sikkens manual; nothing they have is compatible
with lead filler. And they have a primer that's compatible with wood!
(Primer Surfacer EP is compatible with &quot;existing finishes, steel, galvanized
steel, aluminum, any premium polyester body filler, fiberglas free of
release coat, Kombi Putty and wood or plywood,&quot; which means it's just the
thing for priming a Riviera or Westfalia.)
