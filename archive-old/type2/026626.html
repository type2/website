Not that I'm the smartest among us, but if I were in your shoes, I'd pull the battery cable, remove the regulator, pull the cover off it, and check the points in it. I usually don't get much life off one if I find the points arched...because I clean the points and reinstall it. But that, if it's the problem, will get you on the road again while you wait for your mail order regulator.

Don't discount your local FLAPS if you got one. I often find they can get me the part at the same price or cheaper than Bus Depot, and they're way better at answering my questions and generally helping me out. And if I don't support my FLAPS, where will I go when I need a part NOW?

&lt;rant on&gt;
Maybe it's a personal thing, but I've only gotten answers to my e-mails to Bus Depot when there's a check attached. Even a recent inquiry about an order (just asking for help deciding which thing to order) has gone for over a week without a reply and they actually told me over the phone that since they can't figure out the part number on something I want that I should call the dealer for the part number; then call them back. Granted, the dealerships have screwed us on parts prices for years and I'm nowhere near the top of the customer list for any parts vendors, but it still seems less than above-board to ask a customer to use another vendor to do that leg-work and then return to you with his dollars. Kinda like getting a real estate agent to show you a house and then buying it directly from the owner on the sly.
&lt;/rant off&gt;

Anyway, so much for the rant. My point is, don't always assume that your best prices are mail order. I've been able to save as much as 30% over Bus Depot by ordering locally...and BD generally has the lowest mail order prices I've seen. If I'm not in a hurry, I shop around and I include my FLAPs in that shopping expedition. Do be cautious in your shopping that you compare like-quality to like-quality, though.

Thanks! Joe

&gt;questions:
&gt;Did I fry the regulator ?  Should I just call bus depot and get a new one?  
&gt;Did I fry the generator ? Should I go out to the parts pile and find the spare?
&gt;Are there any tests to be run to check the regulator function?  Or is it a
&gt;waste of time with the known history?
&gt;thanks, please respond to the list so I can check for answers during the day.
&gt;BTW, gotta love that fweeeem!
