Subject: Bus drivers are tenacious

I was browsing the pages of the July issue of VW Trends (yes some people 
still read it) and I read the following in an article on the Copperstate Vintage 
show in Arizona &quot;Arizona's Air-cooled Asylum&quot;

(quote) There's little doubt that there's hardly a breed more tenacious or 
inventive than VW Bus drivers (end quote ) ( paraphrase )...the pathological 
devotion of the Type II driver..( end paraphrase)

If they come to this conclusion by observations about busses in the show what 
would they say if they peered into the dark pages of this list!
Yea it's like they say, in fact it's much worse than that!
Take it as it was intended, as a compliment. I'm glad to be in such good 
company.

Thanks to all the tenacious, inventive &amp; pathologically devoted Type II 
owners of the list.
You keep us running and thinking and loving our beast's of burden our German 
camels of the highways and byways.
sniff.. (all choked up)

Thanks for the bandwidth.
