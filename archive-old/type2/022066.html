Subject: What's this funny part on my 1.8L Type 4?
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

Having removed China Cat's engine and partly broken it down, I've come across 
a part I can't find in the manuals. Can someone help me identify it please?

It is a black plastic cone in the upper right side of the case flange, 
penetrating the flange from the rear into the flywheel area. The cone is 
appx. 12mm diameter X 32 mm high. It appears that there was once a cable or 
wire through the center of the cone, but that is now cut off.

The engine was converted from FI to a Weber, so I expect that this is a 
sensor of some sort used by the FI. Since I will be converting back to FI 
someday, if not immediately, I want to replace all the sensors while I have 
the engine out.

TIA/Don Carron
