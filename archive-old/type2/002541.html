Really?

My understanding was that oil began breaking down at 230...  I've heard
several people mention that they're oil temps never get above 180-200 on the
highway unless they're really pushing it...

So you regularly get the oil that hot?  Do you ever have any problems on the
restart when it's that hot?

In no way do i consider 240 an unusually hi oil temp. granted Im in a
differnt climate but i typically see 220 running around town and summer on
the xway i wouldnt even get concerned till it got up near 260.
