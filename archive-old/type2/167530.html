&gt; Knowing damn little about VW motors.................could the pushrod be the wrong length?


used the same old push rods, and kept them in correct orientation and
order, went back in the same position and oriented the same way as when I
pulled em.

&gt; Sometimes the stupid comments lead to the solution, I was sold pushrods the wrong length once for a Ford 429 with hydraulic lifters and my valves wouldn't close.

right now I would happily find it was a dumb mistaake if it means I don't
have to pull the head again.!!!
