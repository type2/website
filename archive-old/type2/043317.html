Subject: Lower case/tranny studs

The lower studs on my case that hold the engine to tranny were really bent
when I pulled my engine this week. The PO bragged how he never used a jack
and let the engine fall on his chest! I 'll blame him. Are they 10 or 12 mm?
The length is about 95mm and the nut is a 17mm.\
