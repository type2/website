Hiya Chris,

You can probably pull the plug without any untoward effects.  It should have 
one vehicle hot lead (which powered part of the computer hook-up) so be sure 
to eliminate that.  Trace the wires to find out what is what or go to 
http://www.nls_dot_net/mp/volks/htm/plug.htm
which is Speedy Jim's excellent website page on the plug for more information.
