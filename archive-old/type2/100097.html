Subject: Re: [T2] 76 bus help!!!

Never try to turn rusty nuts off the studs, you may ruin the stud.  Take a
sharp small chisel and keep it along side the stud and split the nut.  Works
great, doesn't take too long and if you keep the chisel along side the stud,
you won't damage any threads.

Always use new nuts and anti sieze compound when replacing.



&gt; hey everyone,
&gt; need a little help. I have a 76 bus and I'm putting in 72-74 heater boxes and
&gt; exhaust I can only get out 4 of the 8 studs holding the old pipes in the
&gt; heads(2 on each side)  due to alot of rotting on the nuts. They are misshapen
&gt; and no matter what socket I use it seems to be either too large or too
&gt; small.(metric and standard measures) If anyone has had this problem before I
&gt; would love to hear some suggestions as to how you removed them. I would
&gt; prefer not to drill and re-tap the holes. thanks for the help.
