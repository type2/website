Subject: [T2] compression

Listers,
    Good afternoon.  As some of you know I have been gearing up for a
rebuild, but in the process I have stumbled onto some trouble spots.  First
I would like to thank the list for helping me find a counterweighted
crank...

1.) I want to build a stock 100,000 mile engine using better than stock
parts.  What compression should i use to achieve better performance? My
engine is a 2.0L FI.

2.) Would a compression change sit well with the FI? Or will more
modifications besides timing, have to be made?

3.)Unrelated.  How in the _at_#$# do i get the stripped to a coneshape oil
drain plug out?.... Visegrips just slip off and take a little metal with
them.  I have a replacement, but can't get the bugger off.

thanks,
Isaiah
