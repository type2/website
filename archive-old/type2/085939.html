Subject: Re: [T2] Urgent! Need help with alignment

I checked the camber with a borrowed bubble protractor (great tool!) and 
found it within specs, so I do think the toe-out was causing the tire wear. 
Handling seems better now and I'm going to watch the tire wear on this 
roadtrip. Incidentally, in the midst of the alignment work I discovered 
where the clunk in the front end was coming from. It seems the clamp on the 
drag link end had worked itself loose and the drag link end was banging back 
and forth on its threads. (Lucky it didn't come off!). I tightened it back 
up and the clunk disappeared, along with about half of the play in the 
steering, but the damage is done and the drag link end will have to be 
replaced. Can you buy these individually, like tie rod ends, or must you 
purchase the whole drag link? I've only seen the latter advertised.

Thanks,

&gt;
&gt;With a normal crowned road, a severe toe-out condition would result in a
&gt;distinct feeling of pulling to the right.  A crowned street (and most of
&gt;them are, for drainage) will cause your bus to drift to the right a bit.
&gt;To check, find an empty straight road and try driving on the left side.
&gt;Your bus should then pull a bit to the left.
&gt;
&gt;Aussies and Brits, reverse the directions!

&gt; &gt; Thanks very much. After driving it a few more times, I think the pull to 
&gt;the
&gt; &gt; right has actually diminished. It's still vaguely there, but I do think 
&gt;the
&gt; &gt; toe-in adjustment helped. I am going to check the camber this weekend.
&gt; &gt; Again, I appreciate the help.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Much to my chagrin, the brand new (and expensive!) front tires on my 
&gt;'71
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have worn their inside edges down to the flat rubber in less than 
&gt;3,000
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; miles. This after new ball joints last fall. The bus also has pulled
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slightly to the right ever since I bought it and the steering wheel 
&gt;has
&gt; &gt; &gt;been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a little off center.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Having owned motorcycles and understanding the gyroscopic effects of 
&gt;a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; turning wheel, I surmised the front end was toed out instead of in
&gt; &gt; &gt;(which
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would cause the tires to &quot;lean&quot; inward and wear the inside edges). I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; measured yesterday and they were in fact toed out about 3/4&quot;. I've
&gt; &gt; &gt;corrected
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it as best I can and I think they're now about right (0-1/8&quot; toed 
&gt;in),
&gt; &gt; &gt;but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the bus still pulls right, perhaps even a little stronger now. The
&gt; &gt; &gt;notches
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on the camber adjustors point forward, as they should, and they 
&gt;*look*
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; right, but I'm starting to wonder if the camber is wrong. 
&gt;Incidentally,
&gt; &gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; steering is now a bit more off-center.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Wow!  With 3/4 inch of toe-out I'd expect some really wierd handling!
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;the camber adjusters don't always point straight forward.  They are 
&gt;there
&gt; &gt; &gt;to compensate for the tolerances in the front end parts.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;You need to check the camber angle.  You can either have an alignment 
&gt;shop
&gt; &gt; &gt;do this or you can do it yourself if you have a carpenter's level,
&gt; &gt; &gt;patience, and are good at trig.  Check the archives as I think I've 
&gt;given
&gt; &gt; &gt;the complete procedure before.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Million dollar question: Will re-centering the steering via the drag
&gt; &gt; &gt;link
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; correct the pull to the right, or is one of my tires off-camber? In
&gt; &gt; &gt;other
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; words, does the position of the steering worm affect the way a front 
&gt;end
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;pulls&quot;?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;No.  The position of the worm only controls the play in the system.  If
&gt; &gt; &gt;the worm is not in the right place there will be too much play as the 
&gt;worm
&gt; &gt; &gt;is tightest in the straight-ahead position.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;You need to adjust your camber.
