Subject: Re: Gas Leak!

The leak could be from the filler neck (which is rubber; can crack when you
jam in the pump nozzle- make sure to angle it down!) or from the connection
of pipe to gas tank.   Usually the former is a problem if you overfill (I
stop at first click) or from the latter (tends to leak when you make left
turns).  You can get at the pipe thru that round port in the wall where the
ECU is.  My lower connection was all cracked; I glopped silicone calk all
over it and then glopped silicone over a piece of flashing I then wrapped
over the connection and added large hose clamps.   No more smell on turns.
