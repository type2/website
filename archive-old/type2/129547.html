Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Fibreglass insulation

Qpads (or their equivalent) are very nice to use, although expensive.

I've actually been researching the use of &quot;Plastic air pillows&quot; used in  
shipping and packaging as it's my understanding that the air provides 
the insulation and not the material.

HTH,
Harry
