Subject: Installing Bus Depot Mudflaps on a 78.

Has anyone installed mudflaps and can they give me some advice? I bought a 
set of mudflaps (apparently the last set) from Bus Depot. They came with a 
photo copied directions page that is barely legible. I can't figure out how 
they fit, the mounting bracket seems too long and they really don't seem 
like they'll fit. Bus Depot was of no help. Thanks, Jeff
