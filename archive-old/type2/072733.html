there is a cork gasket on the cold start to the air handler, but leaking
air wouldn't cause a rich mixture (it would be a lean mixture).  The
question is whether excess gas is leaking from the cold start after the
engine is warmed up.  You need to disconnect the coldstart from the fuel
loop or check it after it has warmed up to see if it is leaking fuel into
the intake manifold.

 &gt;and the (AFM) cover is loose on the air-flow meter, what
&gt;would that have to do with it?


Underneath the cover you will see a large spring wheel.  If someone has
changed the setting from factory specs (loosen the spring, counterclock
wise) you would have a change in mixture (richer).  If you fool with this
make sure you mark where it is now so you can return it to this spot if
need be.  Did this bus pass emmissions last year?  What were the readings
then.  What are the HCC's now?


I found a problem on my bus was that the one of the connector prongs on the
AFM plug had rattled loose and receeded in the plug housing so there was
only a sporatic connection.  Take the plug off and look to see if all the
connector prongs are forward in the plug.

Do you have a ohm meter?

The following tests are a compilation of resistance test from the four or
five manuals I found during my recent &quot;rich &quot;running problem.

1. Take the harness off the ECU

2. Look in the list library (EFI-Samick, I think) for a description of the
numbering on the pins.  Also fig 4-23 on pg 21 of Bentley shows pin
locations on the harness.

3. put ohm meter contact between #13 and #17 ground.  This tests the
Temperature sensor II.  At 68 degrees it should be between 2000-2900 ohms.
(700-1000 _at_122 degrees; 200-400 _at_ 176 degrees; and less than 200 at
operating temp.)  Testing this at the plug test whether there is a problem
in the harness too.

4.  Test between #6 and # 27 to check the Air temp sensor in the AFM.  It
should be between 2100-2900 _at_ 68 degrees.

Note: if you find a problem,  check the readings at the device.  This will
tell whether its the harness or the devise.

5. Test the following AFM circuits:

            6 &amp; 7      40-300 ohms

            6 &amp; 8      130-260 ohms

            6 &amp; 9      200-400 ohms     (100-300 ohms)

            7 &amp; 8      100-500 ohms     (80-200 ohms)

            8 &amp; 9      70-140 ohms

The readings to the (side) are from bentley for 76 up models but I found
that the Bentley figures didn't jive with the other manuals and were to
restrictive.  (You'll be throwing away good part if you use Bentley)


There are others but these should tell you if you have a defective AFM or
temp sensor #2. which are the likely problem areas if its F I electronics
causing the richness problem.

LET ME  KNOW?

Have fun
