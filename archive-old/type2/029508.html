&gt; 
&gt; Now for the story:
&gt; 
&gt; Driving home from DocRic's several years ago, my bus quit...
&gt; . . . a few miles later it quit again.  DAMN!  
&gt; I walked to a nearby phone and called Merle, my trusty VW mechanic at the 
&gt; time (he has since retired).  He said, &quot;Try this.  Pour some cold water over 
&gt; the fuel pump when it happens again.  Prop the lid open to keep the fuel pump 
&gt; cooler.&quot;  So I did.  And it worked.

His advice was sound in this case.  The fuel pump sits in a relatively
dead-air region of the engine bay, so some turbulence from the open lid
would actually cool it better than the stagnent air normally around it.
Your engine itself probably ran a bit hotter, but the &quot;weak link&quot; was a
bit cooler.

Of course, the obvious question is why didn't you install your spare pump?
