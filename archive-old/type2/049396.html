Hmmm. Curiouser and curiouser.

Could it be a loose component somewhere in the exhaust system?
(do you have exhaust leaks?)

Could it be a loose fan?
(can you rock it back and forth?)

Could it be a loose flywheel/pressureplate?

Could it be a bad rod bearing/journal?
(does it get louder if you accelerate?)

Could it be a bad main - loses oil pressure at low RPMs?
(do you get a flickering oil light at idle?)

any other ideas folks?

&gt; &gt; That does sound wierd.
&gt; &gt; 'Sounds like a diesel' would imply that it is NOT  a
&gt; &gt; high-pitched 'pinging' sound, right?
&gt; &gt; If it is, its 'predetonation' and is bad for a VW. 
&gt; &quot;sounds like a diesel&quot; implies a thunking kind of
&gt; noise that occurs when it idles or is in a low gear. i
&gt; couldn't really hear it when i accelerated, but it is
&gt; definitely there in teh lower rpms. its almost as if
&gt; something was loose and hitting the engine wall. i
&gt; would call it a &quot;thwack&quot; that's why at first i thought
&gt; it was a loose belt.
