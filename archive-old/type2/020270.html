Subject: Re: [T2] '76 &amp; '77 Doors
References: &lt;4f.40dfbc4.2755142a_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

&gt;     Some already know my situation: bought a '77 Westy, the passenger door is
&gt; Swiss cheese, eaten up with rust. When I was looking at the is Westy I
&gt; thought no problem, I have a good door off a '76 in my garage. Well, sometime
&gt; in '76 (I'm told)VW changed the hinge attachment to the body from hex head
&gt; screws to bolts, at least that's the only difference I can see.

According to the VW part catalog the hinges have changed twice:

&gt;&gt; 1975 	1st type (&quot;15mm&quot;)	until chassis nr 2x5 2153 712
'75-'76		2nd type (&quot;9mm&quot;)	from 2x5 2153 713 until 2x6 2126 631
1976 &gt;&gt;		3rd type (&quot;9mm&quot;)	from 2x6 2126 631 until end of production in
'79

&gt; My question
&gt; is: Is it possible to drive that center pin out of the hinge and swap the
&gt; ends of the hinge where it attaches to the body?

I did exactly the same thing. I parted out a 1976 crewcab and switched
the doors of my 1978 Kombi. It worked. Wasn't really able to close the
doors very well after that but perhaps that tells you more about my
adjusting-professionality then about the hinge swap.

According to the information in the parts catalog it could be that you
can't switch the '76-'79 hinges with the pre-1975 hinges. In the remarks
secion it simply says &quot;15mm&quot; with the olders ones and &quot;9mm&quot; with the
newer ones. I can immagine this has to do with the diameter of the
pin...but I am not sure.

ONE MORE THING: Until chassis number 2x7 2137 043 of modelyear 1977 a
different type of &quot;doorcatcher&quot; was used. I solved the problem by
cutting a part of the '76 door catcher away. Just look at them closely
and you'll see what I mean if they are different. They can't be
exchanged because the distance between the bolts in the doors is
different.

My 1977 Panelvan is actually one of those very rare &quot;in-between-models&quot;:

- &quot;'75-'76&quot; door hinges
- old type &quot;doorcatcher&quot;
only 137043 T2's have been made with that combination, how many would be
left?
But that's not it, with the beginning of modelyear 1977 they changed the
position of the M-plate. It is fitted under the dash instead of the
metal wall behind the drivers seat...but they must have had some old
sheets of metal left since the holes for the plate are present.

It is bus #1884 of that model year....too bad nobody ever notices how
rare this model actualy is...&lt;sigh&gt;.
