Subject: FREE 1.7 liter T4 engine complete (WV or DC)

Well I needed another T4 block like I needed a hole in my head.

Free 1.7 out of a '72 I think, not really sure but it has a fuel pump, I
picked it up in some trade stuff, saw it move the ugly bus it came out of
which did not die for engine reasons, can't say anything more, sounded OK.
Complete end to end with all the tin, I'll leave the alternator, heater
boxes are there about 60%, no muffler or exhaust past the boxes.  I'm
keeping the Weber progressive (god knows why) but the rest is anyones for
the taking.  I'd like an interesting trade like a non rusted and relatively
straight '68-'71 rear bumper, or a relatively clean bay windshield with no
chips (at least none on drivers side) and only minor fogging (gave one away
to someone a while back, want to give it back?) first dibs to someone to
supply either but it is free particularly as I'd love to dump this off in
the metro DC area this weekend otherwise it is in Clarksburg WV.
