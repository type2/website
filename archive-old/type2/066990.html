Subject: Re: Where would you go in your VW? &lt;a friday question&gt;

Look, I know it's not Friday any more, but what the hell...!

I'm about to go on my fantasy trip - well, in about 6-7 months - I will
be living in London then, and I'll be going, with my girl friend on a
trip around Europe and North Africa;

        Leave London, 
        Ferry to Calais,
        Bus...Calais, surfing the Atlantic coast of France,
        Around the outer coast of Spain,
        Through Portugal,
        Ferry from Southern Spain to Morocco,
        Across Northern Africa,
        Ferry To Southern Italy,
        Up into Switzerland,
        Through Germany,
        Stop over in Amsterdam,
        Ferry from Zebrugge to Dover,
        Bus from Dover, home to London.

We figure on 6 months - if the bus holds up that is!  It's a '68 Devon
Conversion - I've fully re-furbished the inside and outside....oh, but
now I'm rambling....

Anyway, I'll post details of the trip, prep etc. for anyone
interested...

Jonathan.
