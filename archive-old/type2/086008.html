Subject: Fuel Injectors

While my engine is out, I removed fuel injectors and took them to a place 
here in Houston called Bavarian Machine Specialty.

These injectors have 240K miles on them.  BMS cleaned them and replaced all 
seals for $25/injector.

I'm going to pick them up today.  They will also provide before and after 
spray patterns for each injector.
