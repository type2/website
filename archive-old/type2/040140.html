	If the smoke is from worn rings this is not much further in than the valves
and in many ways an easier job. Measure cylinders and if diameter ok a set
of new ones; hone the cylinders; reassemble and go. I always replace the
exhaust valves if I am in there as they suffer a fair bit (just to make the
job hard again). I am new to this list; and this is my first input; also my
first non splitty van (73 campervan). I found it in back of an abandoned
factory and gave the nice old hippie owner a guitar for it. Gee they are a
real comfort improvement; I am enjoying it immensely. Rebuilding the 1700
and as they were only used here in Australia for one year; am going the
search for bits. Will post pics up on site later. Nice to be here. Barry W.

&gt; if it is blowing blue smoke out of the exhaust and it; &gt; has good
compression i would imagine your rings are;
&gt; going and not your valves.   you can do a compression;
&gt; check; take down thge readings; then put oil in the;
&gt; spark plug hole and recheck.   if your valves are;
&gt; going usually you will have very low compression in;
&gt; that cylinder.
