Subject: Type IV Deep Sumps?

Hi all.

I think I learned my lesson about 80 columns.  Somebody tell me if
it's still messed up.

My friend Rick, a non-listee, wanted me to test the waters and 
find out if there is such a thing as a deep sump for T4 and if it
is even useful.

My bus is a '69, so I know nothing of the T4.

Anybody?

TIA,

Blake  

'69 Westy
