Subject: Re: [T2] Hydraulic valves or solid?

 Well the horse got out of the stable, I said that
you needed a hyd cam to go with the hyd lifters,
didn't say you could not do it. If you don't have the
hyd cam and don't want to split the case seems like it
would be nice to stick with what you have, solid
lifters..Rope that horse, I'm done. Phil
