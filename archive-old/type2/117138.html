Subject: Stalls after 10 seconds?

This morning I went out to start the bus, 78' westy 2.0 FI, and it started
right up but after about 10 seconds died. I easily restarts but the only
way I can keep it running is by pumping the gas. It runs smooth and doesn't
seem to miss, but if I try to hold the RPM constant either at a high rev or
idle range it dies. Just shuts down no misfiring or stumbling just stops. I
have not driven the bus in a few weeks and it was cold this morning (30F).
I last drove the bus a few weeks ago and it ran perfect all weekend. This
is the first time its ever missed a beat. I have not touched any thing
since it last ran. I am wondering if it is temperature related even though
the bus ran great last winter. I had to get to work and could not touch it
but I am going to go home for lunch and may have a look then. Perhaps its a
cold start injector issue... Other FI cold sensitive things to check? Its
funny because it starts immediately but will not run or idle for more than
a few seconds unless I pump the gas constantly.
