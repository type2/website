I'm pretty certain that all of the glass from the '73 will fit in the '78. Also, the engine and tranny will fit fine as long as you put in both. The '78 tranny bellhousing was a little longer and it used a different starter. You'll also find some subtle wiring differences, but they should be pretty easy to resolve. Most of them were in the FI harness, which is not a factor for you...and was a separate harness anyway.

The '73 engine should be slightly underpowered compared to the '78, but you're not making a choice between one or the other (you HAVE the '73 powertrain already).  You may want the fuel tank from the '73, or you'll want to plug the return fitting on the '78 tank--that's what I'd do...and I'd do it in such a way that I could later install a 2.0 liter FI engine....maybe with a shutoff valve I could trust. (I just ran around the block in my '72 w/2.0 liter engine last night for the first time and I'm stoked about the power difference...I'm used to 1600's).

Figure more problems with the '78 than you can see...I've brought 4 buses back from the dead now, and that's always the case. Just go ahead and plan on wiring problems. And brakes...I'd expect $100-$200 in work there...and I don't think parts interchange for the front brakes between '73 and '78 (check the parts catalogs, though; they might). Also figure on all new window seals...which is a good thing. Since the glass is all out, you might want to paint.

Also, before you assume your '73 engine is still good, you might want to test that theory. Rear ending can cause engine and tranny damage. It can cause the case to get hammered and become useless. It can also ram the input shaft into the tranny...either damaging the tranny or breaking the input shaft or the input shaft circlip, which can be replaced without TOO much fuss. It depends on how the impact occurred.

Good luck and HAVE FUN! Joe

&gt;necessary?  Is all the glass the same size?
