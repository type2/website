Subject: definitions

Gentlepersons-
                      This question is floating on another list...Does anyone 
know what de-
fines a rebuilt engine? Or is there a &quot;legal&quot; definition in your state that 
you know of?
GEX tales of terror, notwithstanding, does anyone know if &quot;rebuilt&quot;, 
&quot;remanufactured&quot;,
&quot;refurbished&quot;, etc. have any real meanings; or is it really at the discretion 
of the ven-
dor, what parts are new and what can/should be reused?
                       Years ago, I had an upright from GEX (free shipping 
was the clincher...)
and that engine lasted a week. I used it as a core for a local rebuilder that 
I finally found, who told me about the only &quot;new&quot; parts were the bearings and 
gaskets...
                        As I said, the question is running on another list, 
as to what defines
rebuilt...and let's not even start about transmissions.
