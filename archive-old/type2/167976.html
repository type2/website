Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for a voltage regulator in Oregon - 0 192 062
  007

Call Larry at:

Import Parts Center
2295 N Pacific Hwy
Medford, OR 97501
(541) 773-4240

I'm not saying he has it in stock, but can probably get it quick.  Tell him
Jim from VWG sent ya (and tell him I have not forgotten about the Ghia sheet
metal he wants either).

0192 062 007 = Bosch Short Number 30 048

The original Bosch Long Number is 0190 600 016.

I have used both on my 72 411 wagon - they use the same connector and in
most cases, the alternators on both the 411 and Type 2 are the same.

&gt; Ok, so I'm still having issues with my low voltage.  I don't know why,
&gt; but the voltage on my regulator starts at 14 and drops to 12.5 after
&gt; running a while.
&gt; So, my first step is upgrading my mechanical regulator and I'd like to
&gt; upgrade to a solid state one.  Does anyone know where in Oregon
&gt; (preferably southern Oregon), I can find the part recommended on Richard
&gt; Atwell's site:
&gt; 0 192 062 007
&gt; It's from Bosch.. supposed to be good.  Any recommendations?
&gt; It would be nice if I could get it sometime this weekish... as I'm
&gt; driving back down sometime this week.  I *might* go up towards portland
&gt; and/or Bend, but not totally sure.
&gt; Then, if that doesn't work, I'm gonna go with the Balmar ARS-5 instead.
&gt; Thanks!
&gt; Mike
