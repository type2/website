&lt;&lt; When I bought my bus, there was a hole in the dash and I found a clock in
the cupboard under the sink. I can only assume that the clock doesn't work.
However, I have no idea how to go about reattaching it. Does anyone out there
know which of the many spare wires under my dash could be responsible? Does
VDO make a nice after-market alternative? Has anyone ever successfully fixed a
broken original clock?
 
 Thanks everyone.

I fix them all the time, sorta becoming a hobby for me.  90% of the time it's
a broken wire.  This wire runs from the contact points to a little metal arm
on the coil.  This little are has a sort of double end on it.  How do I
explain this?   It's a little arm and on the end of it is a taco with a hole
in it.  The arm bends enough to reach the points, and then you can squeeze the
taco on to the contact points.  I have fixed several clocks this way!  You may
also want to dress the points up a little, other wise they arch and slam the
arm back when the make contact.  It doesn't sound like a big deal until you go
camping and have to listen to that arm slam every couple of minutes!
