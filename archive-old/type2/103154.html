Subject: I have the dealer installed a/c parts manuals

I paid too much for this,  but it is really neat. It has already helped me
with my 412, today.

For a reasonable fee, I can photocopy info for your car, any model year from
late 60's to early 80's the a/c system the dealer installed.

It has a lot of useful info like screw/=bolt/o-ring sizes, as well as blow
ups of everything should you need to replace something.
