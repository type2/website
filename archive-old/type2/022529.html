Subject: Axle Beam Rust Prevention-Crazy Idea?

Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII


'Morning Folks,
     Well I'm about to head out to the garage to continue on my axle beam
replacement. I have the new torsion arms/ball joints in place, I hope to
get a lot more done today. I'm hoping I can get the clips that hold the
rubber stops in place off the dead beam, the ones on the donor beam fell
apart when I tried to remove them. I'd like to put in new stops, but it
just isn't in the budget right now. Anyway, the &quot;new&quot; beam has been painted
on the outside with POR-15, but as Steve Dolan pointed out to me a couple
of months ago, they rust from the inside out. And, in fact, looking at the
beam I pulled off, which is pretty much rusted away on the upright where
the lower tube passes through, there is obviously a cavity here where
moisture accumulates and starts the rusting process. How, then can this be
stopped? I have an idea: drill two small holes, one at the top of the
upright, one down at the bottom. Pump POR-15 into the top hole, while the
bottom hole is plugged. Remove the plug and let the POR 15 drain into a
container and repeat on the other side. This, I'm thinking would flood the
area where the lower tube passes through with the POR-15, hopefully
stopping any further rust. Crazy? Desperate? Maybe, but by God, if I live
to 100 I don't ever want to replace another beam! Please feel free to blow
any holes in this idea, that's what I'm looking for.     Jeff S.
