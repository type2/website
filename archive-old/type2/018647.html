I'm a bit late here in checking my mail and have about a thousand to go
so if you've already got it sorted then  don't worry. I've just taken my
lock apart after being inspired by something in the list or archives
(can't remember) and it is not too difficult so I thought I'd take you
up on this one.

If  you get to the inside of the door and undo the nuts holding the
whole handle on, you can pull it out and undo the screw that holds the
tang on the end of the barrel that turns with the key. There is a spring
there to look out for as you take it off.

Once you have it off, working on a clean, plain coloured  (yep I'm
Australian and that's how we spell it here) surface as there are some
awfully small springs in there, stick the key in the barrel and pull the
barrel out of the handle assembly.   The theory is that when the key is
inserted all the little bits will sit down flush with the surface so the
barrel can be turned without any bits sticking out. If any of the key
tumblers or whatever you call the darn things, are sticking up that is
what is stopping the lock from turning when the key is inserted.  If you
are really slack you can just get a file and file off anything that is
sticking up and voila! the lock will work with that key inserted that
way about! If you are a bit of a perfectionist you can try rearranging
the tumblers to find a combination that works - great if you are into
Rubik Cubes or jigsaw puzzles as a hobby but definitely not as fast as
the first option.  Option 3, if you don't have a file or just can't
bring yourself to attack the lock like this (even lock tumblers have a
right to be themselves) just remove the key and whip out the offending
tumblers and let them be themselves in the bin or shelf or anywhere but
in the lock where they are causing you so much trouble. You can get away
with only one of the little blighters in there if you want, but every
second Tom Dick or Harry will be able to open the  door with their key
as well  (but hey, don't tell them that - the lock will look just the
same as any other from the outside).

While you are there, if you feel lucky you can pull the tumbler bits
out  and lay them in order and clean the whole assembly out. In the
slots there are tiny springs that push the tumblers up when the key is
taken out - be very careful not to let them go SPROING!!! as you take
them out or you will drive yourself mad trying to find them again.

I used a something-or-rather wonder stuff that is like a combination of
penetrating oil, silicone spray and grease all in one to lubricate mine
and though it was a bit fiddly for a few days  and you had to hold your
mouth just right, it settled down and it now works really well - very
smooth and light like I imagine a new lock would.

While you're messing around inside the door, if you had the time you
could also take the whole lock assembly out and give it a good soaking
in kero or something before attacking it with an old toothbrush and
re-lubricating it before putting it back.  I used the wonder stuff and
the lock works beautifully. Some days I just go out and lock myself out
just so I can enjoy letting myself in again.  It's great and you don't
have to put up with unwanted ads.

Bye for now

Roger
