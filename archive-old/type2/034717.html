Steve, Bob,
     I've used TUFOIL (a moly -PTFE product proven in warehouse vehicles
and stands in Guinness as lowest friction substance) since I got the 78
Westy with 60K on it.....now it has 211,800 on the original never
restored engine.  Compression 130-135 all around.  Not counting heater
boxes/muffler, it's ALL original except for the one time I pulled it to
look at clutch (150K) before mountain trip.  Replaced that disk, front
seals, and some hydraulic lifters/seals.  Purring on same fuel pump,
alternator, distributor, injectors, etc.  We are betting around here
which will fail first- the engine or the trans!  MB
