Subject: Re: [T2] new Pierburg? 34 Pict 3 carb, along with a good
  writeup, and  SVDA? distributors

  The K letter at the end makes it a K-Cal smog carb. These use 2 main jets of an off size and are generally not 
rejettable. The pic on CIP web site does not picture the correct carb for the part number listed. Pierberg, Germany, 
makes their carbs in China and I have had excellent results with them as have my customers that have bought them.

&gt;My guess is these are Pierburg Chinese made carbs, suitable for a 71 Bus or 
&gt;any dual port engine. I tried a Bocar carb and it was bad, this looks better 
&gt;to me. Merry Christmas to all type 2 listees!
