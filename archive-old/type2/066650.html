As I alluded too, on buses the electric fan is only partially
responsible for the heater.  In fact it only turns on with the
heat lever in it's extreme down position where a little switch
contact on the lever hits another to turn it on.
Like Bugs and Buses before them the engine's cooling fan supplies
air pressure for most of the time, look at the bottom of the
fan shroud and notice rectangular ports going into the rear of the
heat exchangers.  This is what does the blowing when the electric
fan is not and hence why you get better flow at higher rpms when the
engine and fan are spinning faster.  This is why I comment on Buses
there is no lack of fresh air to enter the system, this feature
was deleted on Vanagons.  So by running into the electric fan (which
is as you think it to be) you have to keep the electric fan running all
the time (not a problem heat lever will stay down all winter) and
still will only recirculate part of the air.  But this is a bigger
benefit than you first think.  Bob Hoover maintains that simply
providing a low vent exhausting to the outside (perhaps with a fan)
is enough to improve the stock system that has problems as not
enough air can escape and the fan can not push hot air in.  I feel
he is optimistic, my solution incorporates his plus adds the benefit
of taking the coldest air in the bus (though warmer than outside)
and reheating it.  Plus actually I blocked the little flapper on
one of my exhausts from the cooling fan so even more of the recirculated
air had precedence, but never decided (ie measured) if that helped
much.
I did the fix myself the exact way you conjecture with an extra
decklid, and found a nice little grille somewhere to make it
look nice.  On Westys one could also try to use the stock under
rear seat vent which is largely useless, though plumbing would be
extensive.  I mention putting it up the rear wall a little to get
it over the rear pillow on a Westy.
Oh and of course insulation is of number 1 importance all over the
bus but particularly on a pop-top.  I stuffed 2&quot; thick foam I had
laying about into the pop-top hole then taped over the hole with
a plastic vapor barrier, heat will suck out through that hole and
1/8&quot; of fiberglass faster than you can imagine.
And sealing off all the fresh (cool) air intake in front is of
major importance.  I usually use 2&quot; shipping tape applied to the
black plastic mesh bug screen behind the grille as an easy solution.
Of course this whole thing is largely academic on small trips,
I noticed significant gains as I was travelling 1.5 hours over
3500 ft elevations during the worst of last winter often on below
20F days.
And as someone mentioned, the ultimate help is tossing a ceramic
heater in the Westy, plugging it in overnight on a timer for 30
minutes before you go in the morning and starting with a piping
hot bus to begin with.
