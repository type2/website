Subject: Re: [T2] Tire fart for Don

Hi Don,

With that weight rating you should be fine. I think the weight capacity 
is more important than Range C or Range D classification. YMMV.

I'm not a lawyer, and I'm not a tire designer either. Like Ray Nemo, I 
always recommend stock rated tires over a car tire. I MUCH prefer the 
handling of my bus since I installed a set of class C Continental 
RT-735's that are rated for 1710 lbs each. The difference was like 
night and day... the reduction of the understeer effect was incredible, 
and sidewind handling was a lot better as well.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
