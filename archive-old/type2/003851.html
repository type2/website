&gt;Just wondering if anybody knows of any later model Type 2 die-cast metal or
&gt;plastic miniatures, from Matchbox-size, up to big display sizes. I'm
looking
&gt;for '73 through '79 models specifically. I've been checking the online
&gt;auctions and having no luck, however, on a recent trip to San Francisco, I
did
&gt;find an HO-scale version, just what I was looking for, almost matching my
real
&gt;Type 2's colors! I also was wondering what VW's official name for the
&quot;pumkin-
&gt;ish&quot; color on my two-tone '79 is. It's bottom color is brown; I believe VW
&gt;called this Agate brown. I've been told that VW called the colors by
different
&gt;names by different countries...is this true? Your help on any of these
&gt;questions is greatly appreciated!!


Yeah,
there are T2- models (haahhh, I've now self-declared to be a german engineer
too :)) ).
Ok, you've got me.

I've got a plastic HO-scale westy of my '77in my cabinet, home-made from
a taiga-green BREKINA (german) made US  westfalia pop up model and a
bright orange (german  leuchtorange (L20B) and perlwhite (Perlweiss))
coloured
de Luxe Bus.

Also I've got die cast models from british MATCHBOX (barndoor split,
light-blue; split
pop up camper, silver, two different shapes;  green loaf camper with orange
nearly dormobile pop top. Then, in nearly the same scale, I've got different
german
SIKU models, Bus, twin-cab, I've also had a radar-Bus (speed control Bus
with
openig front, gave it to a friend with a radar-split with extra opening door
in the
FRONT, just to hide the radar based speed control unit).

German factory CURSOR made in the early '70s (and reproduces them nowaday)
a Type 2 breadloaf model of  the same size the old Wiking-VW-promotion
models where.
There is actual a model of Eric Melzers &quot;Gerbelmann&quot; 72 panel van available.
Ask him.

WIKING has had different HO-models and years of the bay/loaf in the 70/80s,
the last available ones have been fire brigade cars and Krankenwagen
(ambulances).
Since ages NLA.

German HUKI company is known for zillion different pre '72s plastic models,
busses and panels, printed with all company names you can imagine.

The biggest model I've got (yet :)) is a barbie sized loaf pop top camper
from Mexico, company
seems to be IMPALA, that I've  got some weeks ago from my SO for our 10th
anniversary.

There was also a company called CKO, they made tin models of the bay in the
70s,
Bus, ambulance and, as far as I remember pick-up's.  Those are now available
as repros
made in Czech (really good quality and quite cheap). Those are pre '72
models.
