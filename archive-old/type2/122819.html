Subject: Re: [T2] So, I have a 71 after all, eh? Rebuild or swap motors

&gt; If #3 cylinder broke an Exhaust Valve (Driver's side, closest to the

Increasing the stroke (the distance the piston travels between Top Dead 
Center and Bottom Dead Center -- done to increase the displacement and, 
as I recall, increase the torque) is really just a matter of using a 
differently-spec'd crankshaft and connecting rods, yes?  If I am 
remembering correctly, then it's not really so much of a &quot;procedure&quot;, 
more like &quot;ordering different parts&quot; :-)

&gt; causing the rocker arms to be clearanced on the 'underside' (the 
&gt; surface facing the crank)

Again, my thought process here may be a little rusty, but what does the 
stroke have to do with the rocker arms?  I could imagine you need to be 
concerned about this if you have a taller cam, but as far as I am 
aware, it's certainly possible to use a stock'ish cam with a stroked 
crankshaft.

&gt;  then what are the chances that a new piston (#3), and new exhaust 
&gt; valve and some new heads (maybe just the driver's side) would be 
&gt; enough to get it back to a running state.

This I can't comment on.
