Subject: Re: [T2] Bummed over emblem

&gt; I am bummed.... Got home from hollywood video and
&gt; saw someone stole the front emblem from my 72....

I thought the emblem was held on by nuts.  My bus didn't have one when I got
it, but I was going to move the spare to the front anyway.

How do they get it off without access to the inside of the bus?
