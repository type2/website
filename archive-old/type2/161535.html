Subject: Blower fan to HE tubes

Hey all,

After driving Busses for 8 years, this year I am going to finally have a Bus
with some heat. The new (to me) Bus I bought last summer has most of the
heating system intact except the flaps between the heat exchangers and the fan
shroud and the tubes that go from the blower fan to the heat exchangers. I've
acquired the flaps now I just need the tubes, but I noticed that in some
pictures of other folks' Busses there is a plastic ( ? ) tube the connects the
passenger side heat exchanger with the oval opening to the paper tube that
runs to the electric fan. I of course am missing that piece. Do I need this
part? Are any available? Can you just use the paper tubes? What are other
folks using? I just want to be able clear the windows and maybe take the edge
off when it's cool in the morning. My Bus will never see salt so I don't need
a lot of heat for winter.

Doug
