&gt; Is there any good sources of vintage ads?
&gt;

The best collection of vintage adverts that I've ever seen are in  
Richard Copping's two books, &quot;The Aircooled Era in Colour&quot; and &quot;VW  
Bus -- 40 Years of Splitties, Bays and Wedges.&quot; Both available from  
Veloce Publishers in the UK. Expensive, but easily the best  
collection. &lt;http://www.veloce.co_dot_uk&gt;
