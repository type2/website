&gt; So Santa brought me a sweet electronic ignition kit from Crane. I am

&gt; correct
&gt; resistance built into the coil. My 78' FI 2.0 Type IV has a Bosch Black
&gt; coil.

Santa also left an electronic ignition kit under the tree for me.  I 
was planning on just ordering a new blue coil from aircooled_dot_net -- 
they sell only the one with the correct resistance, and a new coil 
certainly can't hurt anyway.  Cheap insurance at $30.
