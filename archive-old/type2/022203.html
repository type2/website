without a doubt, the general consensus is to *stay away* from GEX.

BeetleMex has been reccomended, as well as Boston Bob or AVP [with
experience from all]

time to give them a telephone call and see what it's like talking directly
to them.

thank you all for your suggestions.
any more will certainly be appreciated.

any suggestions on my wheel part?
it's the one that seems to have a sort of hinge on the &quot;frame&quot; in front of
the wheel and becomes a sort of bowl behind the wheel... then has a roughly
triangle section that points down-rear and the lower part of the shock
bolts to it.
mine was obviously welded once and broken twice... this time the tire went,
so did the shock and broken piece attached to it.

guess i'm going to have to take off work Friday and go to the specialized
recyclers and find one... how compatible is that part [i'll bring it with
me]? should i bother looking at any busses that have one that aren't my year?

wish i was on the road - sol
