I tried a direct reply to the web site and it gave me a
negative response.  So I'll try it this way and if this
appears twice I apologize.
I bought an interior from a 75 Westy this summer and
threw it in my 69 Dormobile.  Last week I finally got
around to mounting the rear closet(driver's side).  But
the wrecker that pulled the stuff didn't include the male,
cabinet side of the hinges.  The door opens down and the
hinges are semi-hidden so a standard kitchen cabinet
hinge won't suffice.  Do any of you fellow pack-rats
have these in your junque pile that you'd be willing to
part with in exchange for a couple of bucks?  Any
suggestions or sources will be appreciated. Thanx
