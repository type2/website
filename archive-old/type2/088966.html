Subject: searching for sliding door part

I'm still avidly searching for a part my mechanic can't get and I still
can't find from anyone.

If any kind soul can help me out, I'd be sooooooo Grateful!
It is the lower sliding door part with the two roller bearings, the one that
guides the door along it's track.
I need one for a '76 Westie.....

Please email me if you have one:
vwbusgirl_at_kc.rr_dot_com

Peace,
Sunshine
'74 Transporter &quot;Buddy&quot;
'76 Hardtop Westy &quot;Cassidy&quot;
