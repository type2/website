Subject: Hoover on Van Fires.

On 11/7/01 10:43 AM, tom.loan_at_sympatico_dot_ca thus spake:

&gt;hopefully starve the fire from that lovely gravity fed tank of gas.  Might
&gt;save a loaf or two. I am interested enough to do it. I want my van to last
&gt;for a long, long time. Anyone have any experience in this, or know of a
&gt;reasonably priced and reliable electric fuel shutoff valve?

Seems to me like Hoover covered this at some point, but then again he 
covered so much that I could be mistaken. I don't have the CD handy at 
the moment, but search of the archives brought up these, most of which 
deal with prevention or thinking about a halon type system:

I expect the CD would contain the remainder of the useful information. If 
anybody has it and can run a search, feel free to pass on the results...
