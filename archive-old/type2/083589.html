Subject: Steering issues in 74 bus

Since I purchased the bus, it has had a lot of
play in the steering, like more than 90 degrees. 
I intend to adjust it up some prior to going to
Buses and Boats, but something puzzles me.  The
steering wheel stays properly oriented when I
pull my hands off the wheel.  But there is much
less play, I mean much less like just a few
inches to the left, but lotsa lotsa lotsa play to
the right.  

VW guy, factory type who eats sleeps and dreams
aircooled vee dubs (and went to Sevierville last
weekend) gave the front end a quick check.  He
drove my bus, looked underneath, jacked it up and
did all sorts of mysterious rituals, pulled,
pried with a board, jerked, and smelled various
parts residing under my bus, while I occasionally
moved my steering wheel.  He deduced that the
right shock is dead (hence my recent shock
questions) it the bolt holding it in is loose
(again).  And that something near the steering
box has too much play (not the swing lever) and
that the steering box probably needs adjusted.  

Any ideas what could be wrong from these
symptoms?  The excess play only in one direction
really has me stumped.
