Subject: Howdy, strangers!

I've been way out of the loop for the past few months. I last drove my
73 from the general mechanic to the VW specialist (slept in it that
night at work) way back in February or early March, and there she's been
since, with a nagging exhaust leak and a low priority rating. H. Steve
says he can fix it when he gets here -- larn my mechanic a thang 'r two. :-)

I didn't have any more to do with the buses until last weekend, when I
volunteered to pile the four Watson girls and their mother, Noriko, in
the 69 Euro-Westy shell to go across town to the Whale Festival at the
local aquarium. The bus started fine after sitting for a couple of
months (!), and we washed it up and piled in for the official maiden
voyage. All was well until we went to leave the beach, and it wouldn't
start! The Watsons were very patient about it, while I called AAA and
got a jumpstart. I was really hoping I could just crawl under and whack
the starter and look like a shero when it started right up, but it was
not meant to be. Time for a *real* battery, not some junkyard refugee!

And d'oh! I forgot the old crap bus rule: Always park on a hill. Just in case.

The fuel gauge DOES work! I just had to put enough gas in the tank for
it to register, but it's a bit sticky or wonky and I won't trust it yet.
I hooked up the speedo cable and it does NOT work. I think I found the
wire that goes to the oil pressure indicator -- it's been cut very
nicely, probably in the process of installing miles of massive speaker
cable under the dash that's going to get pulled out as soon as I
untangle the mess.

H. Steve is on his way and should hit Seattle this weekend. He's
supposed to hit L.A. the following weekend and I'm taking some time off
work to get back into the bus thang. If anyone would like to stop by on
Sunday the 17th, we can bar-b-q whether he's here or not -- p-mail me.
But he's supposed to be here -- with my SO-69 interior for the 69! Woo-hoo!

With Wendelin in the shop and the 69 still incapable of long trips, and
the OCTO and Classic waaaay too early in the day for this girl's
circadian rhythms, I'll meet the Busketeers at Don's this Saturday
afternoon. If any buses on the 5 or 405 see a gray on black S_at_murai with
a crazed female hanging out the window waving, it's just me! Wave back! :-)

Nikki
