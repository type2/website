&gt; &gt;I agree, David, but think we now have to make a distinction between
&gt; &gt;types of EGR valves.  The '78 2.0 has a strictly mechanical EGR
&gt; &gt;activation via direct linkage to the throttle bellcrank, and I think
&gt; &gt;other late loafs used an electrically actuated EGR valve.
&gt;

               For what it's worth, the '81 also has a totally mechanical EGR
valve.
