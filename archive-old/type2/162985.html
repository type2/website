Subject: Re: [T2] Stock Exhaust choices

John Rogers said of his stock muffler:

&gt;  Do kinda wish it were quieter though.

	Possibly useful would be to add a tailpipe of the sort fitted 
to the Beetle for many y  -  which tailpipes were 'mini-absorption 
mufflers'.
	An absorption muffler is a straight-thru pipe i.e no baffles, 
with holes in the wall and a sleeve of glass wool immediately outside 
those holes, encased by an outer shell.  The effect is to absorb 
treble noise ('cackle'), while failing to absorb bass.  The British 
mfr Burgess supplied these first to Triumph c.1961.  I suspect those 
ludicrously loud Harley Hawgs have this type of &quot;muffler&quot;.
	What happens when you slap a Beetle absorption tailpipe on a 
T2 muffler?
	A cheaper way to achieve a similar effect would be to drill 
small holes in your existing tailpipe, wrap glass wool on that, and 
then add a retaining shell e.g copper or aluminium.  This would not 
be shiny krome   ...  ;-)   it could even be a Red Bull or similar 
aluminum can clamped on at the front end by a worm-drive clamp ...
