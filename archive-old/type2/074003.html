Subject: Re: exhasut stud woes... any ideas?

Hi Bill, I stripped my spark plug hole #2 cylinder and
repaired it with a time-sert repair kit. I was able to
rented the tool from john at aircooled_dot_net  From his
website as I remember he also has a repair kit for
exhaust studs too. You might send him an email and see
what he thinks about repairing the exhaust stud without
removing the heads.

The whole repair went very well. I had a spare cylinder
head that happened to have also have bad threads so I
did a a little test run on it first.
Just be sure to take your time,

good luck
