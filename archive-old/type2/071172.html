Here in beautiful Corona Calif the eyesore nazis have it on the books (I know
I made them send me copies) You must store it in garage or behind a 5 foot
fence or it must run. If you can't prove it can run they have the right to tow
your vehicle and charge you for their time. My neighbors landlord is on the
city council and sic'd the nazis on me. The motor for my '70 was already out
to rebuild so I made it a runner and put it back outside in the same spot. Now
I may never do the body work or paint it!! BTW our neighbors in Irvine aren't
allowed to change their oil even in their own garage

'70 Westy
