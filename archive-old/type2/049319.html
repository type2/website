Subject: RE: [T2] Replacing windshield seal use sealant!

I know sealant is required for some window types, but it was my
understanding it was not a good thing on the old style rubber seals on VW's.
Do you know what he used for sealant?

On the topic of the hammer, the point was to apply pressure over an area,
and so if you look back at my original post, you will note that I did not
hammer the windshield -- such a localized force as the head of the hammer on
the glass would bust it.  I did, however, hammer a 6 inch wide piece of
plywood which was wrapped in a towel, which was against the glass.

I concure with your installer's comments, it was a tough job.

Finally, You suggest using a sealant, while Tommy from VW restorations
suggests using solicone lube to make it easy to get it in.  Seems to me
(Tommy are you listening?) that the lube and the sealant aren't going to
work together.  That was my thought anyways.

I decided to use a lube to help get it in, and once I put the lube on the
seal, it seemed to me that any sealant wasn't going to stick to the window
seal.

Finally, I am pretty sure I was taking out the original seal from 1975.  I
looked for signs of sealant around the metal as I took it out, and found
none.  Looks like the factory didn't use sealant.  The original seal lasted
probably 20 years without leaks and rust, and I don't think they used a
sealant.

If anyone has anything further, it would be appreciated.  You can imagine
how much I dread the idea of taking the window out to stick down some
sealant, and want to be sure that its advisable and necessary.

Thanks.

If you don't use sealing compound between the seal and the frame it will
continue to leak and is also not safe.  This is commonly overlooked when
people
replace windows on their buses.  After fighting with my windshield trying to
get
it back in after replacing the seal i gave in and called in the pros.  the
installer said it was the hardest glass he'd ever put in and took quite
awhile.
i asked him why he was putting sealant on the frame of the window he asked
me if
i hadn't used sealant on the other seals i replaced., i told him no and he
said
i should pull them all off and use sealant. without sealant water can get
between the seal and the frame so it isn't water tight and also promotes
rust
because the water can get trapped. The installer has done several buses and
said
he found rust on every single frame.  he said he also found no sealant on
any of
them and said if there was sealant there would be no rust but without it it
was
a guarantee that there'd be rust.
hope this helps someone
jamie
ps i really wouldn't use a hammer on glass. i did this once and cracked the
windshield
