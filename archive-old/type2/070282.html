&gt;The canvas pop-up is in reasonable condition but I have it slated for 
&gt;replacement -- any suggestions as to a source for the canvas?  I'm 
&gt;looking for good quality at a reasonable price, not necessarily the 
&gt;cheapest.
I bought mine from the place in Austin, TX (VW Canvas, I believe).  Very
satisfied; nice company, helpfull and friendly, good quality.  Check for
a small ad in the back of Hot VWs or VW Trends for the phone number.

&gt;One more thing.  I just read an article by Rich Kimball about the 
&gt;1973 Type2.  In this article the author states &quot;On the 1968 through 
&gt;1972 models, the front turn signals were located below and a liitle outside
&gt;the headlights, just above the front bumper.  For 1973, the front turn signals
&gt;were moved higher on the front body panel ...&quot;  I have a wrap around 
&gt;front bumper with the rubber-covered built-in step under the doors.  
&gt;And my turn signals are mounted high on the front panel at either end 
&gt;of the front air intake grill.  Is the article wrong or do I have a 
&gt;diferent kinda bus or what?  The photos in the article are of a 
&gt;Westfalia.
Offhand, it sounds like a '72.  What is the VIN number?  Is there a
manufacture date on a sticker behind the driver's seat (maybe passenger seat,
I forget).  Does it have an upright/type I engine or a pancake/type IV
engine?
