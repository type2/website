Hi Adam,

When I was living in Boston back in 1995, I used to run 10w40 in the summer 
and 5w30 in the winter.  But I was also running it in a '90 Miata, and it 
was Mobil 1.  Now that I'm living in Aspen, Colorado, I run 10w40 Pennzoil 
(non-synthetic!) in my '79 Westy all year 'round.  Just some thoughts....

Take care,
Jason Upper
79 Westy &quot;Sweet Pea&quot;
