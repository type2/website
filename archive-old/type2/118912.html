Subject: Re: [T2] Need Cylinder Head

From: &quot;Access Systems&quot; &lt;accessys_at_smart_dot_net&gt;
&gt; &gt; I need a cylinder head for my 78 2.0 l its got the square exhaust ports.
&gt; that would of course be 79 heads on your engine.  since 78 buses have the
&gt; oval ports.

I was going to offer these until I realized that you need the tops of the
cylinders and not the bodies...

&gt; Part number 029 198 075, in the original packaging.  It's a partial kit, 2
cylinders with pistons, a 94mm piston kit for a 2L.  The pistons are in
their original wrappings and have never been used.  There's also an open set
of seals and gaskets, a Victor Reinz gasket set for a 2L 914.
&gt; I've lowered the price to $140.00 plus shipping for the cylinders.  I'll
be
posting this to the local club website and to the Samba later tonight.

Interestingly enough, I opened the other half of the cylinder box tonight
for the first time to store the seals there and found one of the used
pistons from the original repair job.  (Never thought to look to see if the
box really was half empty.)

The rings are sort of &quot;welded&quot; into the piston head where there's a spot on
the top edge that the piston is eaten clear through to the inside.  Almost a
0.5&quot; of the edge is missing!

If it didn't have the hole in the edge, it might make a serviceable
ashtray...
