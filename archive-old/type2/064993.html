I put black vinyl seats from a Porsche 924 in my bus.  They look great, are
highback, have good side bolstering, and are low profile so your head won't
be against the ceiling.  I just wish they weren't ripped.  :(  They were
not a bolt-in, I had to make an adapter plate and drill a couple of holes
through the floor of my bus.  Mine's not a showbus, so that was no big deal
to me.  I'm actively looking for some nice seatcovers or pads to put over
them to hide the rips.  Overall, I'm extremely happy with them.
