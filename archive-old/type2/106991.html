Subject: removing axle beam Q's

1.  Is it possible to remove a beam off a 71 with the booster without 
opening up the brake system?

2.  Bently doesn't show procedure for removal of beam with a booster.  
I'm at that point and would welcome any suggestions on how next to 
proceed. (Do I remove mc, or can I disconnect it from booster, or can I 
just remove booster from beam and tuck vac hoses aside?  I just don't 
want to create too much unneccesary work)

thanks
Don 71 Westy
