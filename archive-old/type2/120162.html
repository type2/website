&gt; Hey guys,
&gt;
&gt;         I was looking in my VW Bus Custom book, and I noticed that some
&gt; of the busses in there had steel dashes (bay window busses). I noticed
&gt; that the dashes were basically identical to the rubber / plastic dash,
&gt; and that ALL the pieces from the rubber / plastic dash fit into the steel
&gt; dash with no problems. I'd REALLY REALLY REALLY like to have one in my
&gt; Bus. I assume however that these weren't common pieces in the US probably
&gt; for safety standards. If anyone has one for sale, I'd be interested in
&gt; purchasing it. (It needs to be Left hand drive).

The steel dash lives underneath all that plastic on your dash!
Unfortunately, the plastic is molded or glued on so it's a pain to remove.

Some of the first Euro buses seemed to come with it.  If you look at the
pictures in the Bentley manual you'll see it.

You can convert a padded dash to steel by removing the plastic and foam
and then closing up all the holes that they put in the metal to help the
plastic adhere.
