Subject: Crank Fan, and flaps? + GEX?

Hey guys,

     I just bought from BustedBus the other day, their complete flap kit,
as well as a crank fan, and a set of engine lid hinges. Apparently when I
bought my Bus, it was missing these flaps on the GEX rebuilt engine.
Actually, they were nice enough to actually toss in for free, the crank
fan (mine is missing some blades on it). 

     I'm curious exactly how I can remove the crank fan? I see that it's
attached by 3 bolts. What can I do to hold the crank in place so that I
can get enough force to undo those three crank-fan bolts? I'm hesitant to
use the center crank bolt... what have you guys done in the past to
replace a crank fan?

Also, I noticed on my GEX rebuilt motor, there is a little circular tab
with a dot in the center. All around the dot it says &quot;WARRANTY VOID IF
REMOVED&quot;. In the center of the dot, there seems to be some blob of
aluminum in there or something. I seem to recall a thread a while back
about this, that, if that turns red, it means my engine overheated. If
it's NOT red, does that mean my motor has never gotten to significantly
high temperatures???

Thanks!

Todd
