&gt;Worked for me. Love my compressor. And my impact wrench. And my finish
&gt;nailer. And my stapler. And...   ;-)

You betcha!  You can pick up a used compressor for $100 or less if you look 
around and the house brand tools sold by Lowes (Devilbiss) are cheap and of 
good quality.

My favorite compressor tools are:

Vacuum box (for evacuating A/C systems before charging) $7
Impact wrench (sounds cool) $46
Air hose (for tires) $12
Blow gun (for cleaning just about everything including the garage floor) $5
Cutoff tool (cuts through just about anything and makes showers of sparks!) $25

That's less than $100 for tools, so you should be able to get up and 
running for under $200 total.  Then you can start collecting paint 
sprayers, ratchets, saws...

Oh, I also love my tire changer and balancer.  :)
