Subject: weber ICT 34 air filter from aircooled_dot_net FSK0017 question

Maybe I think too much, but I just cant get this
figured out. I want to buy new airfilters from
aircooled_dot_net, and I dont understand why its OK to
have the crankcase breather line attach to one carb
but not the other one. Won't this make the carbs out
of balance? If some one could explain this to me so I
can order the right setup I d be very grateful.

Duncan
