Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Survey Results

I'm taking Business Statistics and right now I am having lecture flashbacks 
about all the possible inaccuracies and the analysis tests that could be 
preformed and ....

My head hurts....

&lt;grin&gt;


&gt;Unfortunately we had only 52 responses.
&gt;
&gt;Of the 52.
&gt;15 use Synthetic(29%)  and 37 use dino(71%).
&gt;12 of 15 of the synth users use Mobil 1.(80%)
&gt;Of the dino folk it was Bush/Gore between Multigrade (18) and
&gt;Single Grade (19) 48.6/51.4.
&gt;
&gt;Where people specified winter/summer I used the summer numbers.
&gt;The temp/pressure readings were to come from a fully warmed up engine so
&gt;as to be as close to what we would all experience on a road trip.
&gt;Avg Idle pressure 16psi
&gt;Avg Hwy pressure  39psi
&gt;Avg Hwy temps     216F
&gt;
&gt;This is where I wish I had gotten a lot more responses as it gets somewhat
&gt;interesting.
&gt;
&gt;Avg temps for syn 218 vs dino 214.
&gt;
&gt;But Avg hot idle for dino was 13.7psi and synth was 23.7 (+73%)
&gt;and Avg Hwy for dino was 37psi and for synth was 44.3 (+19.7%)
&gt;
&gt;&quot;Talk amongst yourselves&quot;
&gt;As advertised it was a 'survey' draw your own conclusions.

Ciao!
