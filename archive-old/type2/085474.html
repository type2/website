Subject: Re: [T2] urgent question/mot/apk

vw bus sends:

&gt; now my urgent 
&gt; quistion were do i find the switch of the backdrive lights [the with ones]
&gt; and how can i acces it easely  laying under my bus with  just a jack in
&gt; front of my house , it some times works for a litle while it sometimes don,t
&gt; work at al  i need to fix it before tommorow 10  0clock

It's on the transmission--my transmission has it on the side. It's the only
thing on a VW transmission that has electrical wires coming out of it. And
you can probably reach it without jacking the Bus up.
