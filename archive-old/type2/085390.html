Bob Lee sends:

&gt; It looks to me that the front turn signals are in the wrong place.
&gt; They should be next to the bumper. In 1972 VW moved the turn signals
&gt; up next to the air intake.  However, I did once own a 1971 bus that
&gt; had the newer style front turn signals. That has always been a mystery
&gt; to me. Anybody know the story on that? The rear tail lights on that bus
&gt; were correct for 1971.

You sure about that date, Bob? Edelstein's a 72 (build date 2/72) and her
front turn signals are down by the bumper.
