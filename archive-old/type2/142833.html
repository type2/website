Subject: Re: [T2] Saturday parts delivery?

My gripe with USPS is the office here in Highlands Ranch, CO, seems to
have a propensity for losing my packages.

Over the past few months I've sent a total of 8 packages, 2 of which
went off into neverneverland, in addition to 2 letters (oddly enough
with money orders in them) that got lost as well.

And I'm waiting to hear if my re-send of one of those has arrived
yet... over a week later.

Grrrrrr.....

But on the other hand, everything I've sent or had shipped to me via
UPS or FedEx looked like it was driven over by a truck. Twice.

Sigh.
