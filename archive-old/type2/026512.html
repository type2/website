&gt;Did you have any problems with the float or gauge? Or am I delusion
&gt;thinking that anybody's gas gauge actually works?

Gas gauge?  GAS gauge?  Wee don nee no stinking gas gauge!!

My 58 doesnt have one.  I'm toying with the idea of using an early 70's bug
speedo with the built-in gas gauge, but will have to find out what the ohm
range is for the sender that is in the tank and for the gauge.  Or maybe
I'll just buy a new mini-notebook (the old one is full) and keep recording
my mileage everytime I fill up.
