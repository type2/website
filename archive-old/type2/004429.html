Cameron is much better (having had the cord wrapped around his neck twice).
He has his Mothers glare &amp; his Fathers snarl! I can't say I blame him, one
of the operations left his little willy black &amp; blue! (yow!).

As for Denise, her blood pressure is better but heart rate is rapid &amp;
thready. We will not accept a Blood transfusion so she is on 8 litres of
'Ringer's solution'. As it turns out most of the complications are due to
the state of the Hospital. The first delivery room they gave us was infested
with ants taking old blood from the delivery trolley &amp; all the instruments.

I'll give more news when I have it.
