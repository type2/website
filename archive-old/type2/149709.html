Subject: Re: [T2] Electronic Ignition Kits

From Crane's website:


&quot;Part Number: 3000-0226

Operating Voltage	8 to 18 volts, reverse polarity protected, negative 
ground. Not compatible with 6 volt electrical systems as these may drop 
below 4 volts during cranking.
Coil Current Limit	4.5 amps internal short circuit protection limit set at 7 
amps.
RPM Range	6,500 RPM
Primary Voltage Output	400 volts (inductive discharge)
Primary Energy Output	90 millijoules with PS91 coil.
Peak Spark Gap	100 milliamps with PS91 coil.
Spark Duration	2800 microseconds at 2,000 RPM
Dimension	5L x 3W x 1-1/2H, 1-1/2 lbs.

Application
XR3000 System for Domestic 4, 6 and 8 Cylinder and VW/Bosch &quot;009&quot; 
Distributor Applications. 12 Volt Negative Ground Only. 1991 and earlier 
non-computer controlled vehicles. CARB E.O. D-225-52
Description

Includes shutters and brackets for installation of optical trigger on 
domestic 4, 6 and 8 cylinder and VW/Bosch &quot;009&quot; breaker point distributor 
applications.&quot;

I'm pretty sure the 'inductive discharge' mentioned in the tech description 
is a capacitive one.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
From Crane's description on their website, the XR700 and XR3000 are NOT CDI 
type ignitions. Crane are not backwards in coming forwards when the ignition 
IS a CDI - look elsewhere on the site. :)

Cheers,

Martin
