Subject: Re: [T2] Weld Through Seam Sealer (was Rocker Panel 
  replacement)

Waht about Picklex (used to be Rassonil)
http://rassonil_dot_com/




&gt; (1) Vosschemie zinc spray--made in Deutshland--a real heavy solids weld
&gt; through primer--
&gt;
&gt; (2) Auto tech Rust Sheild-
&gt; Made in the USA--and a good heavy zinc rich weld through primer.
&gt;
&gt; (3) 3-M Weld Through Primer--pretty runny--the spray nozzle always plugs
&gt; up in these cans--low solids, is not as good as the others.
