&gt;Thanks for all the replies guy and gals, buskatiers alike. Another question I
&gt;wanted to ask was about my ols plugs. When I took them out they were real 
&gt;sutty
&gt;black and the #4 plug had a little oil on the threads. What kind of sign is
&gt;this?

That sign reads, verify compression balance, replace plugs with new stock 
Bosch, verify other ignition components as to suitable condition, check 
point gap, set timing, idle and mixture to spec. Pull a plug from time to 
time to verify they remain clean.
