Subject: alternator charging voltage?

The bus is a 79 with a stock alternator and what appears to be a fairly 
standard, relay controled auxilary battery setup.

What voltage reading should I get when I connect a voltmeter across the 
battery terminals with the engine running at idle and at 3000rpm?

I'm getting a faintly glowing alternator warning light (that I can see at 
nigth) and a slight intermittent engine hesitation that has defied ALL efforts at 
troubleshooting it! I'm wondering if they might be related.


thanks,
