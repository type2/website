Subject: Help!!! Questions on tranny, and break-in '77 Westy

Hello All,

Some time ago, I introduced myself to the list and told of my '77 Westy
which blew the motor on I20 outside of Florence, SC. I am having a shop
in Conway, SC rebuild the motor from the ground up and install a &quot;good
used&quot; tranny. The van is ready and I will leave from Athens, Georgia
tonite to pick it up tomm morning for the ride home on Sunday. I have a
quick question regarding transmissions and break-in.
1. The mechanic says the tranny is from a '72 Van and due to the swap, I
now have a bug-type starter and also a 210mm clutch rather than a 228mm.
Any thoughts?????
2. Is the gearing any different in this tranny than my '77(manual by the
way)
3. The trip home is 320 miles, mostly interstate. Any recommendations on
break-in? Oil changes? Speed?

I am leaving in a few hours and I hope that I will have some imput to
treat this motor right. Thanks for all your help and information.
