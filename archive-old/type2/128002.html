Subject: Re: REALLY stupid Dipstick/Heat Question. 

If you can hold the dipstick by the little loopy
handle without blistering your hand it's not too hot.
I've found out that at about 250 degrees it is too hot
to hold.
IMHO

&gt;I've been searching the Archives about how to tell if
&gt;your engines getting too hot, and found lots of stuff
&gt;saying to grab the dipstick,and if you can hold it,
&gt;it's fine, and if you can't hold it, it's too hot. 
&gt;Here's my question. Where are you supposed to be
&gt;holding it? Just the handle? Down at the end? Where
&gt;oh where.
