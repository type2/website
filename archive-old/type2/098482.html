Subject: Re: [T2] Plug wires and synchronizer readings...

&gt; Two questions for you all.

I can help with the first, not with the second (I am strictly an  FI kind
of guy)

&gt; I'm working on getting my 73 Transporter back to running, and I'm
&gt; curious if there is a way to check my plug wires and make sure they
&gt; are still good.

Run the engine at night with all nearby lights nearby off.  If you see
spark energy jumping thru the insulation, then they are *bad*.

&gt; Or should I just go and buy another set?

Yes :-)

&gt; (On a side note, has anyone ever heard of paying 100 bucks for wires?)

NOOOOOOOO!!!!!  Ron (www.busdepot_dot_com) lists them at $19.95 for Bosch.
Search his site for part #09171.  Ron is generally the best price, but
FLAPS should *NOT* be $80 higher! If you go to a FLAPS, take that # with
you.  I think that's the Bosch # for this set.

&gt; The gal at my FLAPS tried to sell me some at that price tonight)

I think the girl at the FLAPS you are going to is (a) very confused or (b)
ripping you off.  Since I try never to blame on evil what can be blamed on
stupidity, I will go for (a) :-)  Since Ron lists the wires for the Golf
at $95 (It's the &quot;Turbonium&quot;, son :-), I'll bet that is what she was
looking at.

&gt; Also, is there a benchmark level to test where the little red float in
&gt; my carb synchronizer should read? Any suggestions as to why the left
&gt; bank pushes the float all the way up to the top, while the right bank
&gt; only gets an inch or so off the bottom would also be greatly
&gt; appreciated. For clarification its a 73 Bus, manual transmission,
&gt; carbureted. Vielen Dank! --Kevin

Nope, sorry, not a clue :-(
