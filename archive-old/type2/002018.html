The samples from B-quiet came today and with a little heat they turned into
running goo.  The only sample that didn't run was the  VB2,  just not sure
how much this is going to be.

They say the original stuff is just like Dynamat, not at all,  it only got
soft at a very high temperature but it didn't run at all.

Looks like again, you get what you pay for, so grab your ankles and pay for
the good stuff.

Bob
