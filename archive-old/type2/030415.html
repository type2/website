Volks,

This is my procedure for finding the timing notch in the fan of a T4
engine. I go thru it with each new engien/fan I acquire.  Once you find
it, I strongly advise you put a dot of white paint in it soyou can find it
again! Knowing where it is is the first step in finding TDC and VW, in
their near-infinite wisdom, made that notch a (euphemism alert :) *bear*
to find.
 
On a type 4 engine, if you look at the hub area, you will see a notch cut
into the center hole.  follow an imaginary line out from the center of the
hub, thru right edge of that notch to the rim and you will find the timing
notch about 3-5 degrees to clockwise of that on the inner (forward) edge
of the pulley built into the outer rim.  This procedure goes smoothest if
you rotate the engine by hand until the notch in the hub is pointing to
about 2:00, so that the notch is sure to be exposed.

Once you have the notch painted, line it up with the 0 degree mark on the
timing scale and you are at TDC for either #1 or #3 cylinders.  Others
have posted as to how to watch the valve movement to determine which, but
in my usual quick and dirty style, I usually just insert the dist at that
point and look which way the rotor is pointing.  There is a notch in the
rim of the distributor that indicates the #1 firing position and the rotor
will usually be facing it or opposite it.  Facing means you are at #1 TDC,
facing opposite means you are at #3 TDC.  I suppose if your dist drive
gear was badly enough out of whack, then you could be in trouble, but
assuming the engine ran when you pulled the dist, then this method should
work.
