Greetings,

Last weekend the SO and I made our first camping trip in my '79 Deluxe
Westy.  It was a huge success.  The weather was beautiful, 65 degrees
during the day, 30 degrees at night.  We camped at Frontenac State Park,
on the Mississippi.  It's only about 1.5 hours south of St.Paul/Minneapolis,
so it was a good practice trip.

The bus ran perfectly.  There were quite a few big RV's at the park and I
was surprised how many people stopped by and commented on my bus. 
It seemed that everyone owned one of these at some point.  On Saturday
afternoon a '93 EuroVan setup camp next to us and the owner and his
wife stopped by to look at the bus.  He told me that he has had 5 
Westies, starting with a '67 and has continued to own them since.  He
had some great stories.  

I did make a list of the Westy stuff that I need to fix.  First thing is the sink
pump.  There was no running water at the camp site because it was still
too early in the season.  Last night I decided to remove the tank for
cleaning and discovered that the fuse is blown.  That's an easy one. 
Getting the pump back onto the tank, however, did not go so well.  After
an hour of pushing, twisting, and tapping from the bottom of the pump, it's
still not all the way on.  I gave up and decided to give it a second shot
tonight.  Any tips?

I've got a new canvas to install before the next trip, the job looks a little
daunting, but I'll make a stab at it.  Reading other people's reports, it must
not be as difficult as it looks.

That's it for now, thanks for listening.

Rob
'79 Deluxe Westy
