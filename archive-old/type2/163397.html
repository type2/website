Subject: Re: [T2] accelerator cable

In addition to what Don suggests, if you have a cable that's too long and
trim to fit, you can use EMPI's #3170 Throttle Cable Shortening Kit
(actually it is a piece that can be attached to the end of the braided cable
via an allen set screw) - I would recommend additionally soldering (as Don
suggests) to &quot;reinforce&quot; the attachment.

OTOH, if you find that one of the cables you try is like say, an inch too
short to meet the barrel nut/linkage, you can use EMPI's #3171 Throttle
Cable Extending Kit, which just attaches over the solid end of the cable
again via an allen set screw (never needed to use solder on this though).

I have used both of the above, depending on the situation at-hand for the
past 25 years with very good results.  EMPI does have some garbage, but this
product hold-over from their &quot;Mr Bug&quot; days is one of their better products.

After all is said and done and you know which cable is best for your setup,
order a couple more of the same cables as spares (they're cheep, remember?)
to have handy for the worst case scenario.

&gt; &gt; Anybody got a best guess as to which one I need for the single carb
&gt; sitting right on top in the middle of the 1.7L engine?
&gt; As long as the linkage lets you pull the cable through, just get the
&gt; longest and trim to fit. If you have a soldering gun or iron, solder
&gt; the cut end so it doesnt' fray. Or wrap some tape around it.
&gt; The stock dual carb one (and others I assume) has a nice cast end on
&gt; it to fit the linkage... Something for the set screw to tighten down
&gt; on. If you find you need something similar, a bit of solder at that
&gt; point works wonders as well.
