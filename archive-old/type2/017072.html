&gt; Recently at shows and on the 'net, I've run across a few VW folks
&gt; selling VIN plates, cut-out stamped serial numbers, and titles removed
&gt; from (presumably) wrecked or rusted-out buses.
&gt; 
&gt; I've also read posts from people who have had their buses stolen,
&gt; which is obviously a traumatic experience.  I don't think that anyone
&gt; wants to see their pride and joy disappear!
&gt; 
&gt; It seems to me that the only reason someone would buy a VIN plate is
&gt; to make legal a bus to which they have no legal title.  While there
&gt; may be legitimate reasons for this, it seems far more likely that the
&gt; VIN would be fraudulently applied to a bus acquired by theft.
&gt; 
&gt; Every state (and presumably country) has procedures in place to clear
&gt; the title for a vehicle that you possess legally.  There is no reason
&gt; that I can think of to swap VIN plates unless the ownership of the
&gt; vehicle is questionable.
&gt; 
&gt; With the theft problem that we have, should we condone a practice that
&gt; is likely to result in more buses being stolen?

George:
While I wholeheartedly agree with most of what you are saying I must
take exception to one part: Iowa has no procedure for getting a title
for a vehicle which has been junked. Several years ago one could work
around this situation with an Alabama title, but no more. I guess
legislators in their infinite wisdom wanted to protect consumers from
unscrupulous car dealers and figured if anyone said to the state &quot; this
is a junk car&quot; they did not want the  process reversed (as if a
qualified inspector couldn't verify that a vehicle was or was not safe
to be put back on the road). What happens often is that an owner is told
by a repair shop that the repair costs will be more than their view of 
its economic worth, they buy a new vehicle, they go to the DOT for
plates for the new vehicle and turn in the old plates for the pro-rated
unused portion of the license fee and tell the DOT that it is junk. They
get their $12 back, then sell it to some eternal optimist like myself,
who spends $1000 fixing it to like new condition and then finds that he
has a vehicle with a junked title and a VIN number that will be
blacklisted till the end of time (or at least till the Y2K meltdown, if
we should be so lucky). I guess if I could get an Alabama registration,
maybe I could get an Alabama residence and just keep it licensed in
Alabama! (Alabama uses no titles and ownership transfers by bill of
sale- so theoretically you could sell your junked vehicle to someone in
Alabama and they register it there, then sell it back to you complete
with papers to import it back into your state.)
Excuse me I just had to get this off my chest!!

that's what the bottom of that pickup looked like in 69!)
