Subject: Re: [T2] Original Paperwork.Why is it important

&gt; Congratulations on your new purchase Vincent

Thanks! :-)

&gt; I have all my original paperwork on my 1971
&gt; Westy.Sales receipt, manuals, 
&gt; maintenance records and more.
&gt; I find it interesting, but is it worth anything?

If you have it with the car then yes. One of the
reasons I bought my champagne bus is because I got
original paperwork with it. I personally find it
interesting to know the history of a car. That is also
why I do this research on M-codes.

May be it is a bit 'weird' to have this interest
because I know people in my neighbourhood that say 'a
car is a car'...and they are not wrong, but still...



yours,


Vincent
