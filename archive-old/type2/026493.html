&gt;How hard is it to change out an alternator on a '77 Bus???

It's a bit of a pain in the butt with the engine in place, but is certainly
do-able with a little patience.

&gt;My Bus (freshly back from the shop by the way) will not start. 
&gt;The battery is dead as a door-nail. So, we jump the Bus off and 
&gt;then do a quick test of the alternator by disconnecting the 
&gt;battery cable. Bus dies right then.

Was your alternator working before the bus went to the shop?  Maybe the
shop-geniuses knocked a wire(s) loosed from the voltage regulator?

Also, the more I think about it, does anyone know if that is a valid test?
Will a bus run on alternator alone or does it require the battery to at
least be connected to complete the circuit?
