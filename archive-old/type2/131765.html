Subject: RE: [T2] putting a dual carb 1700 into a 1977 bus

&gt;From: &quot;JOHN E HEFFELFINGER&quot;

&gt;Hi, I have a beater 72 bus with a rebuilt 1700cc that has dual carbs.  I 
&gt;just
&gt;got a free 1977 bus that is cherry!  But the engine is shot and the 
&gt;tranny's
&gt;condition is unknown.  The '72 will be my donor for the tranny and engine.  
&gt;I
&gt;will eventually put the proper, FI 2000cc engine into the '77, but will use 
&gt;it
&gt;as a daily driver until then with the 1700 engine.  It is my understanding
&gt;that I will need to remove the electric fuel pump from the '77 since the 
&gt;1700
&gt;has a manual fuel pump.  Does that mean I have to change the fuel tanks 
&gt;too?

No just plug the line you don't use for the fuel pump. The '77 has the 
supply and return line. I would plug the supply line that runs to the 
driver's side and use the return line to connect to your fuel pump. The 
placement of the fuel pump on the 1700 is a good spot to connect to the 
return line.

&gt;When I hook up the electrical to the engine, will there be any more than 
&gt;the
&gt;wires to the starter and coil?  Besides that, it should be straight
&gt;forward...right?

There are a few more connections at the starter terminals that come from the 
bus and not the engine. The rest should be normal.

&gt;I will keep the other parts to convert it back in the
&gt;future.  Oh, did I mention the 77 has A/C, no rust, reupholstered seats,
&gt;cherry headliner and only one small dent?  I won't hook the A/C up of 
&gt;course
&gt;until the project is completed with the proper engine.  Thanks in advance!

Couldn't you just swap the flywheels and clutches and just use the 1700 
engine with the '77 Trans.?

Good Luck?
