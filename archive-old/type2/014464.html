Geez,,, guys a battery tray is not that hard to install nor is it that 
expensive,,,,when you do the quick way and fill it with all the filler caulk 
and such it makes fixing them rite later alot more work ,,,believe me i know 
,,also a note either way you do it leave a place for the water to get out 
,,tray's have the hole in them for a reason ,new repo trays have a gap in one 
section against the out side wall for a drain in addition to the hole under 
the battery ,,,,,,,no offence intended for the way some people do their buses 
battery trays ,,do them how ever you want this is my .02cents..i was taught 
if your gonna do it do it rite,,(donning fire suit),,later
