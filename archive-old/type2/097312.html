Subject: in need of longblock/engine rebuild

Casey Wrote:
&quot;I am wondering who you guys are having your engines rebuilt by. Where and
what is the price of the rebuild.&quot;
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I am needing to locate an 1800 longblock to start my engine rebuild, but I
understand there are tools and parts I'm going to need from a machinist.

First off, where would be a good place to locate a longblock for under a
grand?

Thanks to all,
Peace,
