First I want to appologize for the posts asking about tourqe for various
things. A little closer inspection of the Bentley and I found most of them
at the end of the engine and clutch chapter. Sorry!

The question: the boots that connect the intake manifolds to the throtle
body. Are they a PIA or is it me? Are they sided - I mean is there a left
one and a right one. One side went on fairly well and the other the right
looks like the boot on the back side is going to tweak off any minute - it
does not look right!! I hope I am making sense - the boot is not straight on
from the throttle body to the intake manifold tube but almost a Z.

Also for any one taking of the plate in the engine compartment to get to the
gas tank on a 79 there are two sheet metal screws on the bottom that will
prevent you (it did me --- with lots of explitives) from taking it off.
 
If children are not learning then we should change how we are teaching them.
