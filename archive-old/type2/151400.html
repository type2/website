Subject: T1 85.5 Big Bore

Greeting all -

I hope you all had a great holiday season and New Year (and Chinese  
New Year!).

Now that the 1915 is nearing completion (ready for the '70 Vert), I  
am hankering for a stock bore, long stroke motor.

An 85.5 (bore) * 82 (stroke) = 1883cc motor

Any problems we can think of?

I know the ratio of Connecting Rod Length (CRL) to crank (82)  
dictates the rpm/torque (shorter CRL = more torque at lower rpm),  
which is what I want. So stock CRL is proper for my intended app. I'm  
only looking for a max of perhaps 5000rpm.

I want to build the greatest CC motor THAT's RELIABLE. Tell me the CC  
of the crank!

Mike
&amp;quot;STB!&amp;quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
