I gave away the one from my Riviera. Coolers work beter for me.

&gt;The Riviera is IMHO a bit poor in the floor space arrangement. Thanks to 
&gt;the ice box right next to the sliding door you can't carry much but people. 
&gt;It is the first thing that would come out and live in the garage if I had 
&gt;one.
