Subject: Re: [T2] An Air-Cooled Vangon X-over pipe question

&gt;I've determined that my recently-acquired Federal '82 Westy needs an exhaust
&gt;crossover pipe.  My question has to do with how the lower end of the EGR
&gt;filter connects to the crossover pipe.  The crossover pipe on my '82 has a
&gt;welded-shut &quot;nub&quot; where the connection was made, so I'm not sure if the
&gt;crossover pipe should have a flange that mates with the flange on the EGR
&gt;filter.  The reason I ask is that the *one* example of a crossover pipe I
&gt;was able to find in the local &quot;Pick-a-Part&quot; yards (not an air-cooled
&gt;Vanagon, an earlier bus) has a similar &quot;nub&quot; (i.e., a smooth pipe), though
&gt;this one isn't welded shut.
*****************************
80-83 Federal Air Cooled Vanagons originally had the &quot;nub&quot; for the EGR
Filter pipe attachment and was never welded up.  If memory serves however,
the 79 Federal Bus used a similar crossover pipe but does not fit the
Vanagon, correct placement of all the attachment points being slightly
different.  Bus to Bus, Vanagon to Vanagon, etc.

But, my late father always said &quot;A big enough hammer, torch and
hacksaw.......&quot;  :-)

Check my site for the 79 Federal Bus Diagram:
