Subject: Propane refrigerators

I just spent a few minutes browsing literature on Rob Henley's website
(Nice, Rob. Thanks!). As I was reading over the LP Gas owner's manual insert
(http://www.baywindowbus_dot_com/propanetank02.jpg) I got real interested in the
section regarding purging new propane cylinders of air before use. Basically
it says that if there's any air in the tank, it will mix with and dilute the
propane, necessitating constant adjustment of appliances and causing pilot
lights to go out.

What I'm wondering is how many people who are resurrecting campers, filling
propane tanks for the first time in ten or twenty years, may actually have
air in their tanks that is causing difficulty in keeping the refrigerator
flame going?

Don't ask me why I'm thinking of refrigeration right now....
