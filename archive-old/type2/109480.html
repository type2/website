Subject: Re: [T2] 80 MPH Type 2

&gt; and for what it is worth, I won't drive behind a roll off tow truck, that
&gt; sharp knife edge of the back end of their truck is at waist level, I just
&gt; have nightmares of hitting one and being sliced in half.........  OK some
&gt; I'm just a little paranoid

I share this paranoia...ironically I was following one of these on Sunday in my
'79 westy with my wife and both kids (5 year old in a booster in the front seat
because thats where the 3 point seatbelts are) and got thinking about its...that
edge was just about the right height toslive my van in half...

I backed off about 6 car lengths.....
