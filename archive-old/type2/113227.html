It is not the vendors job to read your mind and figure out that you don't 
know what parts you need to make an upgrade work. RTFM beforehand and you won't 
have the problem. And arrangements have been made to try and mass replicate the 
cooling boot on my end. If it works out, I'll be the first to tell the List.
