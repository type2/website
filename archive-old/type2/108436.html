Woo Hoo!

Excellant!  I have been scrounging the yards for old defrost vents
for months now.  The odd thing is that the inserts from the 74's and
75's seem to be weathering better than those from the 76 model years
and later.  Maybe VW went to a cheaper resin?

I currently have two busses.  Both are 76 model years.  The inserts
that I am referring to are those that are on top of the dash board.
Those that direct the hot air from the heater boxes at the
windshield and 'defrost' it.  Mine are all roached from too many
years of summer fun and sun.  The plastic is very dry and brittle
and crumbles when you touch it.  I found a good set off of a 73 bus,
but I would rather keep these in my parts boxes for a later stock
resto, than to burn them up from sun exposure as well.  If you could
throw me a quote on what a pair of these will cost, I may purchase
two pair.

I am also in the market for late bay style rear hatch hinge covers.
I have been finding tons of these for splitties, beetles and even
the lovable but equally neglected type 3's, but NONE for the late
bay body type.  This would also be something that I would love a
quote for.

I am aware that you cast your own door handles and such.  Since you
do your own fabrication, and if you also cast your own rear hatch
hinge covers, is it a possibility to have these hatch hinge covers
cast in the same black as the front defrost vents?  I am putting a
black headliner in and hinge covers that are actually black and not
just rattle canned black would be super cool and much better
looking.
