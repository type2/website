&gt;&gt; I used grease but can't figure out why everyone says to.  They slid in
&gt;&gt; just fine without grease during the trial fit.
&gt; 
&gt; I prefer a synthetic grease for cables. It doesnt gum up, turn to putty,
&gt; breakdown or pick up moisture as readily as conventional grease.

The grease isn't just for lubrication. It's also for rust prevention.

Bob Hoover recommends painting the cable before installing it, which is a
good idea too. So, paint, let dry, grease, install.
