Subject: Re: CD Ignition

Ron asks whether the CDI ignition from a Porsche could be used on VW.
The distributor on the Porsche six thru 1977 has points, so those CDI units
should be pretty adaptable.  The Porsche distributor 1978-&gt; is Hall effect,
and even more expensive, so that's riskier.  I don't know what makes them
(the CDI boxes) so expensive, aside from &quot;you have a Porsche, you can afford
it&quot;.  Known good used ones go for $200, since the new ones are so dear.
