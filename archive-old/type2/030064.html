&gt; What's that red &quot;B&quot; dash light for again?
&gt; 
&gt; Brakes?

Yes!  it's the test light for your dual circuit brake system.  It
functions as a logical &quot;and&quot; gate.  Look at your master cylinder.  You
will see that there are two brake light switches.  One is for the front
circuit, one is for the rear circuit.  If they are both &quot;on&quot; or both
&quot;off&quot;, then the &quot;B&quot; light is off, if one or the other is on, but not both
(you have pressure in one circuit but not both), then the light comes on
to let you kow it is time to *STOP DRIVING* while you are still alive :-)

&gt; And when you press it, should it go on? like testing it? Mine doesn't go on 
&gt; when I press it.

Depends on the year and model. The test on my '71 SB was that you pressed
it and it lit (this is a bulb test only).  The test on my '73 is that it
comes on with the gen light at start up.  The test on my '78 is that it
comes on when the parking brake is engaged.  Your '69 might well have the
pres-to-light settup, I don't know, I've never owned one of that year.  
You'd think VW would have stuck to a uniform system, but alas, they
didn't. :-(

&gt; BUT
&gt; 
&gt; It went on the other day, and stayed on. But while I'm press the brakes, it 
&gt; goes off.

Well, *something* is wrong!  I can't tell you without seeing the bus, but
it might be:

o One circuit is blocked open - your brakes in the front or rear are
always on, at least a bit.  A piece of crap blocking the return port in
the MC can cause this, or a blocked flex hose.

o A lead has fallen off one of the switches on the Master cylinder - go
down there and have a look.  This is my personal best guess, sight unseen,
but you still need to fix this.

o One of the switches has failed - and you need to replace the switch.
Messy job, since you need to bleed the whole system :-(

&gt; I don't have a manual to check what the heck I should do, I just got the 
&gt; bus.
&gt; 
&gt; Low brake fluid?

Not the usual symptom of that, but barely possible.

&gt; I'm not driving the bus until I find out.

Bravo!!!  I like this a lot!
