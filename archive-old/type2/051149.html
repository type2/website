Subject: [T2] electric blankets &amp; sundries about the 221,000 mi. Westy (never rebuilt)

(the MUTS in the reply to refers to a musical instrument support I sell)
Hello, I'm back on the list- and yes the 78 bus has not quit yet with
221,000 miles on a never rebuilt engine.
Finally got around to replacing a leaky manifold gasket (it was half
gone) but stripped one stud end and also had another stud start to spin
in the head...- so I put a u-clamp over the bottom of the manifold which
trapped a piece of 3/8&quot; all-thread with a washer and a nut- this runs up
to a hollow body beam nearby that has a giant washer and nut holding it
there.  The stripped end had good threads hiding in that rather deep
manifold side, so I simply sawed it back about 1/4&quot; and got a nut on it
fine.  All tight now......As for those pesky up-pipes that have very
little metal left to grab the stock gaskets, I used cut your own gasket
material for exhausts and sandwiched it in double thick.
    While at it, I tackled a leaky valve cover gasket, and decided to
check the hydraulic lifter clearance-
I use a turn and a half (270 degrees)- seems like if anything, they got
a bit looser!   If your lifter is not pumped up, remove the adjustor net
and spin the bolt by hand until you just feel it touch the valve; you
can't get it sensitive enough using a screwdriver.
     Been using the bus quite a bit to sleep in, and I use an electric
&quot;lap blanket&quot; that just covers the area of the rear bed- it lies on top
of a flannel covered down comforter, and itself is covered by an
unzipped sleeping bag.  A flannel covered 1.5&quot; foam pad helps when laid
on the stock seatback bed.  No problem sleeping in a 10 degree bus. 
While driving, I use a 300 watt inverter (about $60 at Pep Boys) and
this will power 2 50/100 watt lap blankets (lo/hi settings), one keeping
the bed warm and the other over my lap and legs.  To take out the chill
when stopped I have an electric heater if power is available or use a
radiant propane heater- the latter is great for defrosting the INSIDE of
the front windshield.  These really don't give off monoxide unless they
consume too much oxygen; not a problem if you use a 2 hour canister.  I
use these very briefly because they add to the condensation load.
The 4 amp 12 volt blankets I question if warm enough at under 50 watts.
