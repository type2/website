Hmmm...this brings up an interesting idea.  For those of us without the 
(expensive!) equipment and facilities to tune to CO readings and 
without a local aircooled VW/Porsche guru to trust sticking anything up 
the pipes ;-), how's this sound?

We have a pretty good benchmark for MPG (17-21, cruising, I've 
gathered).  We have a somewhat rougher benchmark for CHT under #3 spark 
plug (~375-425, cruising, flat, 70 degree ambient).  I propose one 
could tune by slowly enrichening (turning AFM mixture screw in?) and 
watching the trade-off between the two variables.  All of this, of 
course, within the bounds of good driveability (i.e. good cold 
starts/idle, no plug fouling, etc.).

I would expect there to be some point of diminishing returns for each 
variable with richer--&gt;lower CHT and leaner--&gt;better fuel mileage.  
Holding everything else constant (that's a big task, I realize), there 
ought to be a point at which head temps are happy and fuel mileage is 
reasonable.  From Richard's measurements, I would think one could get 
pretty close by 1/4 turns of the AFM idle mixture screw.  Once this 
position was found, it might be worth paying a shop to test (but not 
fiddle with!) CO readings for reference.

What I don't yet understand is how spring tension would enter in.  It 
may be that some mixture &quot;maps&quot; are such that one could never hit the 
sweet spot.

Any thoughts?
