Subject: Re: Carb blowers..will this work ?

&gt; of flow and restriction, about 700 watts is needed. This is less than 1 hp
&gt; of electrical energy required at 13 volts drawing about 50 amps. This
&gt; gives a net 4-6% HP gain at the driven wheels, which is maintained
&gt; throughout the HP curve. It's not peaky like a cam or header, but constant
&gt; from end to end
[...]
&gt; 
&gt; Better for occasional use, but with a 4 to 6 percent gain in HP, its
&gt; probably not even worth it.  Figure a 60 horse motor... 5% gain, that
&gt; ammounts to 3 horses, 1 is used up to run the blower, thus a net gain
&gt; of 2 hp... wont really let you pass mustangs on an uphill grade... if

Just a few observations...

First of all, that's 4-6% at the driven wheels, as in, what you might
observe on a chassis dyno.  The HP gain at the crankshaft (where that 60hp
is measured) is probably more...  possibly not much more, though.

Secondly, the &quot;e-ram&quot; as they call it, also provides a corresponding
increase in torque, which is arguably more important to the bus owner.

Of course, nomater how you look at it, it's only a small gain.  One would
probably be better off just getting a real (crankshaft-driven) supercharger,
which would produce more like 5-15lbs of boost.  Then again, increasing
manifold pressure (and therefore compression) in a gas engine shortens its
life.  Maybe it's just better to drive slow.
