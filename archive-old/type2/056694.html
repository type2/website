I did it!

Bought a gasless MIG welder and welded a new sliding door rocker in place.
Looks perfect. Mind you I never welded before. I did some research and read
about MIG welding so I knew the theory. And in theory, there is no
difference between theory and practice. But, in practice, there is.

I will put together a description of what I did and send it to the list as
soon as I have an hour or so to spare.
