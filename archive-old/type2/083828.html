&gt; Of course this is true. My contention is with how pumps fail. Do
&gt; these fuel pumps fail in such a manner as to incur reduced
&gt; efficiency before complete failure, or is is all or nothing. Someone
&gt; with more experience with these pumps would know better than I. My
&gt; postition rests more on an all or nothing pump. Your point is valid.

I am really far from an expert, but used to sell/consult for water
well pumps. little different, but work much the same. In those pumps I
saw both complete failure &amp; reduced performance. So I have based my
opinions on my experience w/ pumps in general.
 
&gt; You're still leaving out the pressure regulator. Simply sticking the
&gt; guage in the loop will not tell you whether it's the pump or the
&gt; regulator. Each must be isolated, which brings me to my volume/time
&gt; method. Though not foolproof, it helps make an educated decision
&gt; about where to go next. You can't driveway test the regulator like
&gt; you can the pump. 

Actually you can:
So quoteth Sir Bentley: &quot;you need a fuel pressure gauge to test the
fuel pump and the pressure regulator&quot;

Instructions for testing the regulator are located in section 10 page
11 &amp; fuel pump testing on page 20. But for both of these tests you
have to have a pressure gauge.

but your correct that you can't just hook up the gauge &amp; expect it to
say which one is defective (if either). there are seperate tests for
both items.

&gt; You're talking about two tiny large sweep 90's fixed to the tank.
&gt; Wire brush &amp; solvent?

true. But you can't just replace them :)

&gt; We ARE testing fuel lines. And pumps and regulators. 

I'm sorry, but what you suggest sounds more like replace &amp; see if it
works. We are very fortunate as VW owners to actually have very good
procedures to test almost everything on a VW engine w/out paying an
outrageous amount of $$ for testing equipment &amp; when it's not possible
to test it Bentley says flat out &quot;you can't test it&quot; like the afm.

&gt; The focus is
&gt; NOT the circuit as a whole. We're past that. This guy has directed
&gt; us to the fuel system. We are now trying to help him isolate the
&gt; PART of the fuel system at fault. Pressure gauge tells you low
&gt; pressure. Is is restricted lines? Fuel pump? Regulator? Injectors?.
&gt; When he goes and buys his pressure gauge and tells you that he's
&gt; proven his suspicions of a suspect fuel system, we're back to square
&gt; one with zero knowledge of which part is at fault.

Actually the focus is the fuel system as a whole. If he picks up a few
diagnostic tools w/ a little time &amp; the bentley he should be able to
narrow it down to the culprit.

&gt; 4. replace regulator with known good.

nah, just test the one in there.

&gt; This process addresses the troubleshooting and maintenance issues in
&gt; a logical, productive manner with thought to cost.

it's usually cheaper to test first then replace only what is broken.
Aside from replacing the lines (for safety) that's all he should
replace until determining broken parts.
