Subject: [T2] new case; thermostat?

I'm just beginning a rebuild starting with a new Brazillian AS41 case. I
noticed that it is missing the stud which appears on the lower right side
of my old case which holds the thermostat bracket.

Why is the stud not there?
Am I expected to drill and tap the new case to install the thermostat and
cooling flaps?

Jack
