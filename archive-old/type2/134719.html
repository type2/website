Subject: RE: friday topic - TEST - Tires - wheels - fuel lines

&gt;So instead of a 50-100 question test...  how about a list of 50-100 things
&gt; new bus owners need to know ;-)  Hey, I could use it.


       I think this is a great idea. Although we have access to a wealth of
VW
knowledge in the Type2 library and archive, You have to be looking for a
specific thing to find what you want. If there was a list of common rpoblems
and things to do for the vw bus newbie it would help alot of folks. One
thing that it should have is a pre-driving check list. Like check the oil
kick the tires etc etc.... Also a good matinance scedule for oil changes
valve checks and so on. This would good since the new owner that didn't know
what to ask could start off on the right track. Also a few of us that have
had our vw addiction for a while now might learn a thing or two by reading
the list. Just my .02
