Subject: No More Leaks

What are the chances of getting my '78 2.0 L not to have a single leak? I've
had 5 type 1's, and I've always prided myself on making them leak free.-
just to kill the stereotype.

I just replaced the engine main, fan seal, the tranny main shaft, oil cooler
seals, valve cover gaskets. I think I may have a leak at the oil sender -
seems to be coming right out of the plastic on top of the unit. The dip
stick tube bellows and gasket for the oil filler tube seem to be a problem.
I used some &quot;Indian Head&quot; gasket sealer on the rubber bellows- too early to
tell. I didn't buy a new gasket for the oil filler, I see a little wetness
there already.

Anyone out there that has a 2.0 that doesn't leak? This is not a survey.
Just trying to prove to my neighbor that all VW's don't mark their spot. Any
advice appreciated.
