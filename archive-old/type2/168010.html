If I  take a 2L bottle of Coke(tm) and put a valve near the bottom on each 
side (one  valve is the size of an aspirin and the other the size of a tennis 
ball), fill  the bottle half way and pressure it to 50 psi at the bottle cap, 
when I open  the valves at the same time, most of the fluid is going to escape 
from the  larger valve which has the least resistance. To increase the flow 
through the  smaller valve I have to constrict the larger valve.

Isn't this  analagous to the fan shroud (bottle), large valve (cylinder 
gaps), small valve  (oil cooler air channels) and fluid (fan shroud air supply)?

The rate  of airflow (mass over time) also has to be considered with regard 
to cooling.  While the pressure drop across the oil cooler exists, will enough 
air mass  flow through it or does the Type 4 engine have to lower the flap in 
place to  force a greater quantity of air through the cooler at all  rpms?




hello Richard  that is a pretty good way to express the way it really  works. 
just like water it will take the path of least resistance. I personally  am a 
firm believer in using the flaps and thermoon both type1 and type 4  motors.
