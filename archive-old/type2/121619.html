&gt;Superior in what way??????????

James Hayden and I have already been over this a couple of times.

&gt;&gt;  Even if it died every five years I would carry a spare and use it 
&gt;&gt; because it does a more consistent job of keeping the batteries charged 
&gt;&gt; than a stock mechanical regulator.
&gt;
&gt;Just cause you say it doesn't make it true.

Fair enough.  Let me rephrase that - &quot;It does a more consistent job of 
keeping MY batteries charged than MY stock regulator did&quot;.

&gt;&gt;It takes more time/money/skill to make a product superior.

Not always true.  Some products are superior by virtue of more modern 
technology, and often they are simpler and less expensive to produce at the 
same time.  Do you think that parts designed in the '60's are the best that 
ever were and will be?  Please.  Better tell John_at_aircooled not to sell any 
more Mallory distributors (or SVDA) as they are not stock, and therefore 
inferior according to you.

&gt;&gt;I will ask the question again - please answer it this time.  How did you 
&gt;&gt;determine that the regulator was stressed by poor connections?  Or an 
&gt;&gt;alternator or starter for that matter?  Please provide the tech behind 
&gt;&gt;this assertion... or are you simply making assumptions?
&gt;
&gt;I am reporting observations. Melted insulation, frayed wires, tarnished 
&gt;fittings, corrosion, porous solder, resin weeping from solder, purdy 
&gt;colors on terminals, quicky-cheap terminals, dirty batteries. In every 
&gt;case excess resistance building heat at the weakest point in the circuit.

Dodge - That does not explain how or why the regulator failed.

&gt;My observations show high failure rates with other than OEM

An extreme generalization.

&gt;One example: 1959 Mercedes 190, unknown huge mileage. Starter motor 
&gt;problem.&lt;snip&gt;

Again, you did not explain how spliced wires, etc. caused the starter to fail.

&gt;I can't see why you have a problem with me giving the opinion that a Wells 
&gt;regulator has nothing to do with a solution at all. It adds weakness to 
&gt;the OEM robust design.

I disagree - I think it improves the OEM design.

&gt;  Want a high cost compromise solution?? Dead battery, assume regulator 
&gt; issue, buy cheap replacement fry it in a few months under the same excess 
&gt; stresses that killed the OEM part in several years of holding up to 
&gt; building excess resistance elsewhere. The root cause was not the 
&gt; regulator, but poor maintenance. And you go on to report a problem with 
&gt; the OEM part.

A totally contrived, meaningless scenario.

&gt;If it does last that long, it will be due to keeping the battery and 
&gt;cables and terminals clean and tight via proper maintenance procedures 
&gt;more than anything else. I suggest that if the vehicle was properly 
&gt;maintained in the first place the failure would simple have not happened 
&gt;in the first place.

Failures happen, even in the best-maintained vehicles - to believe 
otherwise is to be ignorant.  I would like to think that the vast majority 
of the members of this list care enough to properly maintain their busses 
and minimize (not eliminate) failures.  I can tell you that my battery 
cables are all clean and did not contribute to regulator failure.

&gt;Cheaper is better is a fools assumption unless cheaper means apply the 
&gt;highest knowledge base given by those who know best and lose never a dime 
&gt;to poorer results than OEM provides.

*sigh*.  I never said cheaper is better.  You are dodging my legitimate 
questions and putting words in my mouth - I think it's time for me to throw 
in the towel on this subject.  I am keeping my Wells regulator though.  I 
will keep your bad experiences with other Wells parts (useful information, 
that) in mind and if the Wells ever fails me I will look for another 
solid-state, modern regulator (Bosch?) to replace it.
