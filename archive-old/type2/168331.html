Subject: Re: [T2] Oil leak and lose of power

Hi Tom,

Sorry, my signature used to list that stuff, but I guess I turned it off.

I am running a '76 2.0 liter FI. The last time I did an oil change was a few
months ago, but I have done no significant engine work to speak of.

I am using her right now as my daily driver, which she has not been in over
5 years (primarily stored) so I thought that maybe asking so much out of her
after being stored for so long may have caused the issue. Lord knows I
developed enough vacuum leaks from that 5 years of storage...

-Jason

&gt; Jason,
&gt;
&gt; I would refrain from attempting to draw any conclusions relating the &quot;loss
&gt; of power&quot; and &quot;oil leak&quot; until you have more data.  The oil leak may just
&gt; be a bad seal where the valve cover fits onto the head or something
&gt; similar...hopefully!
&gt;
&gt; What engine are you running/what year is your bus?
&gt;
&gt; Have you done any work on the bus or engine lately?
&gt;
&gt; Whatever you do, add some oil to that puppy and make sure you don't
&gt; get too low!
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt;     Tom

&gt; &gt; I have not done a compression test, as I do not have a tester (I am at
&gt; work
&gt; &gt; - but will get one on the way home) but I guess I wanted to see if
&gt; anyone
&gt; &gt; else thinks that I may have blown a head gasket? I first noticed the oil
&gt; &gt; last night when I came home from a Dr. appointment. The lose of power is
&gt; &gt; what is directing me toward compression and the head.
