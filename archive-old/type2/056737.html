Subject: Re: Rear hatch -- interior latch?

&gt;If you take a piece of wire and thread it thru a hole in the latch 
&gt;arm, then drill a hole in your new panel and feed the wire thru 
&gt;the hole in the panel, you have a way of escaping the van for 
&gt;whatever reason 

Just please be aware that if you carry small children (or drunks) in the
back of the bus that one little tug on that wire is all it takes to open
the rear door.  So either make it hard to get to (like tape it down with
duct tape) or else lock the rear hatch.
