&gt; 14. VW has a funny way of putting it in the owners' manual: slowly
&gt; depress the gas pedal&quot;. Duh? If you slowly depress the gas pedal, soon
&gt; it will be fully depressed. On a hot engine, might as well fully
&gt; depress it first.

Al, as usuall dead on, but.... there is a reason to depress the pedal
slowly! If you give it a pump on a carburetted engine, you will pump a
shot of gas into that is exactly what your flooded engine does not need!  
If you depress the pedal slowly, the accelerator pump will pump less of a
shot in there.

I know that the acceleration pump should express exactly the same volume
whatever the speed you depress the pedal with, but for some reason, in my
experience, it doesn't work that way.

&gt; On FI engines, this is less relevant, because the injectors on inject
&gt; relevant to the position of the blade in the AFM anyway. Some OLD FI
&gt; might still need open throttle when hot starting.

You might well be right, but I have never had a &quot;flooded&quot; FI engine...
used to happen to me all the time in carbs, but not FI.  Characteristics
of the beast, perhaps.
