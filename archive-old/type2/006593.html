As was mentioned by someone else, The weld pak is good, but i can never seem
to find just the right setting to weld low heat on panels since it clicks in
between A-B-C-D. The Hobart that is sold at Costco/Price club etc Is what
you should get since it has a completley variable switch. They dont have it
on display, you have to ask them to get it out of the back for you. However
i do all welding with my weldpak 100 as do many people. You can make it work
but i suggest getting the 100$ gas hookup to go with it.

&gt;I got a Lincoln Weld-Pak 100 and I took it to my welding class at the local
&gt;high school to learn on and I could weld 1/4&quot; steel plate no problem. It
&gt;should be no problem to weld sheet metal on buses.
