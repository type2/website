&gt; &gt; Hello, I have a 72 van and last night i changed the oil.  I thought
&gt; &gt; i put enough oil in.
&gt; 
&gt; Look in your owners manual. there is a section on how much oil the
&gt; engine will/should hold. There is also an allowance for the oil filter
&gt; being changed or not. You shouldn't have to wonder if you have put
&gt; enough oil in the engine or not. You either put in too little, too

you did put some oil into it, even two quarts will be enough for the short
trip you took, did your oil light come on??

&gt; engine and check for leaks. Either a loose drain plug or any other
&gt; source of leaking.

yes, did you put the drain plug back in??? sounds like a dumb question but
it happens.

&gt; &gt;i drove about 5 blocks to the gas station and it wasn't running very
&gt; &gt;good.  very low power.at the gas station i looked at the engine and i
&gt; &gt;went to check the oil.it was nearly empty.oh no.
&gt; 
&gt; Yea, OH NO sounds right, unfortunately. This is not really helpful

??? if there was even a minimal amount of oil in the engine you should
have had enough for 5 blocks,  I suspect that the oil change was
coincadence(sp) and not cause and effect

&gt; empty. Did you happen to look under the bus for any signs of leaking?
&gt; Perhaps even the drain bolt was very loose &amp; coming loose?

YES!
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; so i filled the engine with oil and it barely started.it seemed to
&gt; &gt;run okay after it started so i went on my way.  i was heading down
&gt; &gt;the freeway and i could hear a chattering noise like the valves were

what year bus??? hyd valves will sound this way if starved for oil..

&gt; &gt;loose.and then i heard what sounded like a metal can bouncing around
&gt; &gt;in the engine.sound seemed to come from right side.  the engine died

bad sound 

&gt; &gt;and then it wouldn't even turn over_dot_can anyone help me determine what
&gt; &gt;i have done?
&gt; 
&gt; Just to verify, when you say the engine will not turn over, do you
&gt; mean you cannot get the engine to turn at all? or it just doesn't seem

yes if you can turn it by hand you may be able to get a clue as to
what/where it happened, did you do anything else to your bus when you
changed the oil...???

how was it running before you changed the oil??

&gt; to want to turn (like a dead battery)? If you cannot turn the engine
&gt; by hand at all there is something seriously damaged with it. You need

wish I had better news but

&gt; to start looking around for a mechanic or buy a few engine rebuilding
&gt; books and start reading on the procedures you will be undertaking

don't spend money at GEX, plenty of good places to spend your hard earned
$$$$

sorry but it doesn't sound good, how many miles on the engine??  

if it is any consulation most of us have been in yyour shoes at one time
or another
