I've had back luck with spark plug sockets. My preferred tool vendor was changing manufacturers and as a result their spark plug socket became unavailable. I bought a crasftsman spark plug socket and I found that the rubber inside gripped the plug to much and the socket stayed with the plug when I tried to pull it out. I eventually found a better fitting regular socket and put the rubber piece inside and tailored it to my needs. With the engine tin in place the 6-sided top that most spark plug sockets have doesn't really come use anyway.

The hose technique is a good trick but I still don't like dealing with plug #2 on a FI bus.
