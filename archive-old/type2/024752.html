Subject: New Bus Owner/ Price of Valve Job?
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Ok, well I'm new to this list, and have been waiting for somebody to post 
about valve jobs the past couple weeks, but it hasn't happened. Well heres 
the deal. Theres a pretty nice &quot;Poo Brown&quot; 78 Camper 2 blocks from my house 
that is just asking me to restore it. The interior is inact and it doesn't 
need much body work, but it does need a full valve job. The owners from 
Washington and she has offered me a fair price, but I know nothing about 
working valve jobs.

    I've learned that it has a new 1800cc engine, and has had alot of other 
mechanical work done to it in the past 2 years. I have asked a friend who 
owns a bus, and he thinks it'll cost me around a grand, and thats way too 
pricy for me right now if I want to maintain it. Owning a Bay-Camper has been 
a dream of mine for years, and I'm sure alot of you remeber my screename from 
contacting you over the past couple years about you buses for sale, well I 
remeber all yours at least. I'm just wondering if this bus is &quot;The One&quot;. Any 
information would be appreciated, I am willing to do any work on my own, but 
I have 0 expirence w/ working on Vw's or any car for that matter. You can 
e-mail me privatelly or post to the list.

    Thanks in Advance,
