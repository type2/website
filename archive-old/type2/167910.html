Subject: re: tell us about YOUR heat

Actually it's very hard to overfill the little green bottles using a 5lb
bottle as a reservoir.  Even with freezing the small bottle in a freezer,
then refilling it outside on a hot day I can't usually get it more than 3/4
full.  Buy a new small bottle, weigh it accurately, then weigh a completely
empty one and you've got 2 reference points to tell you how full it is.
Simple numbers don't lie (unless you're in politics, or an accountant or
selling stocks).
