Hi Justin,

Check your pressure relief valve. You may need to install a new/different
spring for more tension.  You should have more than 4 psi at idle.  I would
think at least 10 psi.  with a stock 1600..


Stalling:  Sounds like: 1. Vacuum leak at the electro-magnetic idle switch
2. Brake booster hose/connections leaking. 3. I know you have the valves
adjusted properly, but every vw engine that I have ever worked on, will
start to stall *when you come to a stop* as the valves get tighter. This
seems to be especially true if you do a lot of freeway driving.....

My very best regards,

[...]

&gt;
&gt; Alright, I need to jump in here.  Every time my engine gets warmed up
&gt; (driving on the freeway for about 15 minutes), the oil press light will
come
&gt; on at idle.  What the heck?  It seems to idle at about 4psi and I am using
&gt; 40W.  My idle is adjust correct too.
&gt;
&gt; Separate topic:
&gt;
&gt; When I am driving my 71 cold and I push in the clutch to come to a stop,
the
&gt; motor will die.  If I am coming to a stop and I push in the clutch and
then
&gt; blip the gas, it will not die.  Is there something wrong with my idle
&gt; circuit or what?  I could not find any useful information in the archives.

&gt; &gt; Hi Tom and Dana,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; I'll bet your hot idle oil pressure after a
&gt; &gt; half hour of 55 mph driving is not very high (5 to 10
&gt; &gt; psi).  &gt;
&gt; &gt; Rob
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; If it drops below about 7psi, you'll start to get the idiot light, right?
&gt;
&gt; If i drop an new engine in properly and i start to get an oil light - at
&gt; anypoint during the warranty period -i'd be on the phone immediately.
