Hey there! 

I just recently built the engine and the cam/lifter package looked great
(even the cam still had some of the metal treating on it). The engine had
about 15,000 miles on it since the PO had it rebuilt. The problem is the
unknown mechanic didn't pin the bearings and one began to spin (turned so
slightly) and cutoff the oil supply. The other problem was that hey didn't
pay attention to oil clearances and it was pretty sloppy inside. So my oil
pressure was crummy. 

I built it was STD size bearings all through and have some of the bearing
noise I had before. I plastigaged everything but being on a tight budget, I
didn't have anything turned. The machinist said it would be fine. I think
he's right but it's noisy when the oil is hot. Better but not good enough
in my opinion. But next time I'll know what needs to be done, build it as
tight as the Bentley manual says is okay!

As for the lifters - I never had noise before I built the engine and
chalked it up to my first engine build - mistakes and maybe some dirt that
got inside despite my efforts. I've be adjusting the valves but to no
avail. But like you said, gotta wait for the lifters to bleed down. I've
been trying to start it up right away.
Thanks Karl!!!
