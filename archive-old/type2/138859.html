&gt; I hadn't even given it a thought.  I was just looking in the owner's
&gt; manual chart which shows 30w OK down to 32F and 20w50 OK down to 15F.
&gt; Of course, they don't mention whose 20w50.

I found some more up to date info at Chevron's CA site (at least pertaining
to their own oils):

http://www.chevron_dot_ca/ProductsServices/Retail/MotorOilLabel.htm

If you look at their viscosity table...

https://www.cbest.chevron_dot_com/generated/MSDS/PDS2036674.PDF

...you'll see that 10w30 and SAE30 have the basically the same viscosity
except that 10w30 can start the engine in much colder weather.

WRT your quoted oil choices: although 20w50 can start in colder weather look
how much thicker the oil is than SAE30. Based on those number it doesn't
seem like a good idea to switch to 20w50 for winter if you are achieving
your goals with SAE30 during the summer. You would be better off with a
lighter oil as long as you are maintaining the proper oil pressures.
