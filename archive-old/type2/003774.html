Hi list,
    I talked to my local VW guru today and learned something *odd*.  Have
any of you come across an engine Type 1 or IV that had a stamp in the case??
The stamp would look something like FM 73 or FM 1985.  Well, this guru has
been working on ACVW's since the late 50's and he claims that he stamps his
initials and date of rebuild on the case of every engine he does.  Thinking
he was wack, I asked for some kind of documentation.  So, he pulls out a
diary/scrapbook looking thing and sure enough he has kept records of mostof
the motors he has reworked.  Wow!  If you come across some case and it bears
the stamp, I could get you in touch with the guy who put it there.

Keep the peas and pass the whirl,
Isaiah Smith
