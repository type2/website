Subject: dished vs. flat cam question

Got a question for all you 'upright' motor folks out there:

I'm building a motor for my 58 single cab and the motor I'm starting
with is from a 74 bug.  So its got a dished cam in it.  I've got a flat
cam that I want to use and I'm going to buy a new oil pump anyway.

So my question is:  If I buy an oil pump for use with a flat cam, can I
use the flat cam with no other modifications?

Thanks!!!
