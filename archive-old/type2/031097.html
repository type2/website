&gt; &gt;4.  My wife has no clue how to drive a manual.  Of course, she'll learn.  I 
&gt; &gt;would be the best place to ask it.  A very unreliable source told me that VW 
&gt; &gt;had also made automatic transaxles?  I'm not sure how true this rumor is, but

welll, I have a 78 2liter with auto tranny....and my 0-70 time is 
4 days, 7hours, 23 minutes, 43.783 seconds (with tailwind)  ;8*&amp;

but I sure can have fun getting there ;8*}
