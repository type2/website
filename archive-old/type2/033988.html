Subject: EGR valve?

I have read through Muirs manual, and my Hains is lent out to a friend. I 
cant figure out wher the EGR valve is. I have taken my engine out twice, one 
for cylinder head and rings, next for a blown piston. I have been through 
everything and cant find the location of my EGR valve.Can anybody clue me in?

Thanks,
