Subject: Installing Radio in 71 Westy

Just finished removing the original Sapphire XII from my 71 Westy and
replacing it with something more modern.  Nothing too fancy,
AM/FM/cassette, 40 watts total output into either two or four
speakers. Used some suggestions from list members as to where to
install the speakers.  Installed two Radio Shack 3.5 inch model
40-1419's in the grill area on the dash.  Perfect fit.  Removed the
door under the rear seat, replaced it with a 28 in by 8.5 in piece of
1/2&quot; plywood.  Cut two 6 by 9 ovals into the plywood for the
speakers.  Used Radio Shack model 40-1429's for the rear.  

Used this approach because I didn't want to make any cutouts in the
bus out of respect for the two previous owners who never made a cut
out or even drilled a hole in the bus.

I'm totally satisfied with the result.  I would not recommend just
installing dash or rear speakers. You need both front and rear to get
a full sound.
