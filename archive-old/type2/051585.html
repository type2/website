Hey list, yesterday I needed a new battery for my 79 Chevy pickup, so off in
the 74 Westy I went to Sears.The day was perfect, my new custom overhead
dash that holds my cd player was looking good and when I turned the stereo
on classic Doobie brothers Rolling down the Highway started jamming out the
speakers!!I couldnt have asked for a better song to start my trip in the
Bus!!On to the highway I went 65mph and no problems!!! But as I got on the
road I noticed the Bus pulling to the right, and when I used the brakes
major squeaking from the right hand side. Now the Bus pulls to the right
when I apply the brakes. Hmmmm I had the squeaking before but not the
pulling. I still think the caliper is stuck in the open position, I looked
this past fall and the pads are brand new. Just got my new Bently in the
mail, all the info in there is so overwelming for a novice mech at best.Any
other clues as to what it might be? Also my brake lite on the dash has
decided to stay lite, I had to take it out cause it started to melt the red
button, which I replaced a couple of weeks ago with a non 74 brake
light.CANT WAIT TO GO CAMPING!!!
