&gt;     I have done Yahoo, Altavista, MSN, Lycos, Type2 archive, The Samba,
and
&gt; a few other places with not much exact luck. Either its about ppl who
&gt; already had it installed and no info on where purchased (I know, check to
&gt; see if there is a e-mail and ask, and hence why I am starting with the
&gt; masses before going door to door asking). I have searched for diamond
plate,
&gt; chrome, chrome diamond plate, anti-fatigue plate, steel plate, flooring,
&gt; cabinets. &gt;&gt;
