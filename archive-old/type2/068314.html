&lt;&lt;Any storage suggestions for *any* bus parts welcome, including tranny

more interested in little parts, like door locks, electrical switches,
ECU, etc.&gt;&gt;

TLC and a desire to do things right the first time ought to do it i think.
This is an interesting subject, i've seen a lot of parts that were poorly
stored, for instance, crates of speedo's, people that keep things in 
piles, a week ago i saw an otherwise -perfect- 74mm 356 crank with rust on 
the journals... (!)
