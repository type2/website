Subject: Westy Clutch Saga

Some data on Vanagon drivetrains and results lacking in repeat repairs.

Todays candidate with the cross shaft problem is quite a history. It's a 87
Westy. I know, not a T-II, but the design under discussion is the same as
yours. 

Motor replaced 1/99 by others. Looked right but didn't replace the water
pump. Fall 99 I set this up for the road via maintenance inspection.
Changed tranny lube, no evidence of concern on the magnet. GL-3/4 Valvo
90wt. Flushed the clutch, brakes, replaced inner cv's, coolant change,
yada, yada. 

He heads to Utah/Ca. Makes 6000 miles and has shifting probs. Diagnosis in
Santa Barbara is tranny gone. This is a Bosch authorized shop. They install
a &quot;rebuilt&quot; tranny from Bend, Oregon (I fergit the name but you probably
know of them)  which is (first clue) PAINTED BLACK, , but otherwise seams
to be functioning nominally, no leaks, ect, and with new &quot;clutch kit&quot;.

600 miles and a coupla months later, while on loan to &quot;friends&quot;, clutch ist
kapput, burned up. 
New &quot;clutch kit&quot; and grind flywheel, replace seal, but don't polish the
seal surface or really clean the holes in the flywheel of the carbon fiber
from the fried disc. 

He finally makes it back up here, I test drive. Clutch feels descent up and
down 15% grade. Look over linkage ect. Advise, clutch feels right, don't
know if we got a German clutch or NAPA, don't know, don't know, don't know,
that it is right, ie spec., but there is some weapage already, and it is
evident that NONE of the priors cleaned the rear motor flange cause there
was still grit in there. 

Backing it into the stall the other morning, I noted just a subtle little
chatter in R. Hmmmm?

Pull tranny. Pull clutch. Pull flywheel. Flywheel grind and depth gut. Oil
seal was weeping too much for new. It shur looks a whole lot smoother with
5 min. and some crocus cloth. 
  
Clutch ist LUK. Disc looks no better than the MexSax stuff, not the pure
round rivet holes typical of the German variety F&amp;S. VW Brazil t.o.
bearing. Dry splines. Note x-shaft fingers wear. Pull x-shaft. Set up
straight edge. Fingers not in plane with axis. Order new shaft. Get Mex
JUNK. German shafts NLA. Hire maschinist to grind original to a new radius
in plane. 

(Save any that can be reground. We may never see a German item again 'cept
at the NLA booth at the VW shows. Guess what. German Blue Coils are NLA.
Now we get Brazil item with bare alum. case with dark blue sticker and no
new bracket.) 

Did the x-shaft come with the &quot;rebuilt&quot; tranny? Probably. First opportunity
to inspect the x-shaft was at the tranny rebuild, then at the replacement.
Again at the next clutch replacement. I am the fourth person that had the
opportunity to follow procedure and in every case in the order as given by
Bentley, &quot;Inspect the cross shaft for wear.&quot; 

I have no reason to believe that anyone was acting in malice. It's just
been too long since they read the book, and they have learned to skip some
steps, which means they know not the Deutsches Method, yet they think they
are VW mechanics. 

If that's what VW mechanics are, then you simply must find an Neandereer
(Neanderthal Engineer), who understands procedure, and the danger of
skipping something or several steps. That is, danger to the owner's
pocketbook.

For what he has paid to get the clutch right, I could have fixed the clutch
properly and added considerable maintenance and inspection services to get
him down the road without unecessary hassles and expense. There's never a
Neandereer around when you need one, so cash flows, and value suffers.
