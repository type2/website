&gt; &gt; I've got an 80 Vanagon that has a gas
&gt; &gt; leak. It appears the leak is in the overflow 
&gt; &gt; tank n the drivers side. The leak seems to be
&gt; &gt; coming from where one of the lines fit into
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; tank. Any ideas how to
&gt; &gt; fix this? 
&gt; 
All too well.  Search the vanagon_dot_com site for
this as everyone seems to do it occasionally. 
You probably have a rusted gas tank and are
leaking out the top of the tank.  Good news is
that bus depot has them cheap.  You may only
have a broken vent line or vent line connector.  


Bad news is you need to drop the tank.  Not
that bad of a job though, once you get the hang
of
it.  I can drop it on the side of the road in the
rain in twenty minutes or so.  (Ask me how I
know.) And I'm not particularly mechanical.  
 
Check Bently for the instructions.  But, from
memory, the procedure is basically that you
remove the gas cap and unscrew the three screws
holding the filler neck.  Then remove the filler
 neck.  
 
Next you get under the van.  Remove the two fuel
lines.  (One goes to the filter and the other is
a return line.)  You'll get gas all over you
and your wife (or husband) will yell about the
 fumes. Obviously, try to keep it out of your
eyes, mouth, etc.  

You'll see three brackets that hold the tank in. 
Remove the rear bolt on a bracket and it can be
removed.  The front of the bracket is not
bolted.  It fits in a slot in the frame.  Do the
other bolts.  Obviously, the last one should be
done with care.  If you remembered to run the gas
out of the vanagon, your tank won't weigh that
 much. 
 
Lower the back (back means back) of the tank just
enough to remove the gas sender.  Now you can
slowly lower the tank.  There's several vent
hoses still attached.  It should now all make
sense.  Be very careful with the plastic Y's
and the hoses.  The wise person replaces them
all.  Fools like me replace them piecemeal so I
get plenty of practice dropping the tank.

The tank has a low spot on top (for the heat
tube in an aircooled vanagon) that collects road
 salt and rusts.

Whilst you have the tank dropped, you should
consider replacing the coolant pipes (or heater
pipe in an aircooled?).  If your tank is
rusted, those pipes are ready to go also.  (Ask
me how I know.)

Do it all in reverse to put the tank back in. 
Put the grommets back into the tank and use a
little silicone grease to get the vent lines to
easily insert into the grommets. 
 
Now I know that some guru will say they have
the dexterity of a surgeon and small hands and
can
stick their hand over the wheel and over the
frame and check the Y's and lines without
dropping the tank.  I did it for about three
hours, skinned the crap out of my hands and
arms, then dropped the tank.  YMMV.  

I'm cross-posting to vanagon_dot_com in case the
more knowledgeable types over there notice that I
forgot something or I am smoking dope and really
giving you the instructions for a MGB or
whatever.  

PS I just noticed you said overflow tank on the
driver's side.  The expansion tank is on the
passenger side, but maybe you're not in the US.
 
Don't really know what an overflow tank is.  
 
PSS  Ken Wilfy has or had a kit to do this,
assuming you need to replace grommets and Y's.
