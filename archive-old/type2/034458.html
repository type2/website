well i have been putting off a tune-up for too long now so decided to
buckle down and do it!!  i spent the last two days doing a complete
disection and rebuild of the stock duals.  the left side was in worse
shape than expected.  i had to take 2 left side carbs apart to make
one *good* one.  

i also finally put in a stock dual vac dizzy.  my choice is a 022 905
205AB (hope i wrote the # down right?), which i had been searching the
salvage yards for months for one that would be closer to original than
my 009. anyway i hooked the vac lines up (manifold vac for the retard
side and carb vac for the advance side)...she fired right up on the
first try, and idles better than ever in the last 5 yrs or so of
ownership!!  

anyway, my question is-- i still have some vac ports on the carbs and
manifolds that dont go anywhere.  like on the manifolds there is a
*dashpot* looking thing that is on each manifold, with a vac port in
it.  where should these go??  i ran my retard/advance lines both from
the left hand carb??  does this sound correct?? also there is the
balance tube that runs between the carbs, where does that vac port
go??  and which line runs to the valve to let in preheated air on the
stock air cleaner?? also i need to fine tune the carbs.   right now my
settings are :
big screw on top--3 1/2 turns out
little screw on top--6 1/2 turns out
little screw bottom (flange under carb) 6 turns out.  

do these sound right??  also, does anyone have a simple procedure for
setting the carbs??  

well i set the timing _at_ 5 ATDC and it idles nice, i will see what she
runs like tomorrow on the road, but so far i am never putting a 009 in
again!!!!  		

thats all for now,
zzz
73 standard 331,000 miles, still running stock dual carbs.

**ps..when putting in new plugs i also found #1 plug very oily.  what
is the test to determine whether it is valves or rings that are going
bad??  the rest of the plugs were excellent!!
