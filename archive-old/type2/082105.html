&gt; Hello all,
&gt; i picked up a type 4 motor that was in a 73 bus but it is kinda strange, It
&gt; has dual carbs and the oil filler is on the top of the motor on the 
&gt; breather
&gt; box and the dip stick is from the top as well. I looked where the bus 
&gt; filler
&gt; and dipstick go but there was no holes in the tin or shroud.
&gt; I copied the Case #  EA042420
&gt; Any Ideas??
&gt; Thanks, 
&gt; Bryan
&gt; Hi everybody sorry to pick this one up so late, the oil filter housing was 
loose on my bus so have been busy fixing it but that's another question. This 
should help with type 4 questions also toucan I think it is runs a several 
type 4 bulletin boards E-mail me if a search doesn't find it. 
I own a 76 bus fitted with a 1.8 AN engine fitted with dual 40 single choke 
carbs and an auto box.
