i've done it with the engine in the car, but it's a royal pain
and you're likely to strip an intake manifold nut if you're
not careful (ask me how I know...) in which case you lose
and have to pull the engine anyway.  If you've got an extra
day or so and a place to work, you might just want to pull
the engine...

more details on how i did it with the engine in, later if you're
still interested (no time now).
