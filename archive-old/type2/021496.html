Subject: Re:dipstick vs sump oiltemp. senders
References: &lt;B770BDC1.E98%BusBarn_at_prodigy_dot_net&gt; &lt;5.0.2.1.0.20010710145801.0288b0f8_at_mail.plano1.tx.home_dot_com&gt;

I'm concerned that the sump sender would be affected by the leakage of
heat conducted out to the finned sump and loweing the reading- how do
they insulate from that?  The sump has different surface temperatures
when in traffic or the open road; same if it rains.  The dipstick sender
I made from a meat thermometer hangs in the oil without touching the
bottom.  Yanking the sender and getting the dipstick is not such a big
deal, and I do it at every gas fillup.  
   One subject to address is: Isn't the oil sucked up at the sump going
throught the oil cooler before the bearings- ie it will be cooler that
the sump temp.  It's all relative, and will at least warn us if it goes
abnormally above what we know is normal at a given speed and outside
temp.   MB  227,000 mi on original engine

&gt; hassle of wires hanging in your engine compartment and having to carry a
&gt; separate dipstick with you and insert it every time you want to check the
&gt; oil, be my guest - but don't do it because you think you are getting a
&gt; better reading in &quot;hotter oil&quot; because it's simply not true.
