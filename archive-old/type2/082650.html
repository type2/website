Subject: Ultimate at EveryBus? &lt;friday post&gt;

hello again everyone!

we all know that EveryBus 2002 is just around the corner.
will there be any Ultimate Frisbee freaks, other than
myself, in attendance?

IIRC there is a field adjacent to the camping area that would work nicely
for a game.

if you are interested, please contact me off list.  i'll try
to compile a list of people who are interested &amp; get some
feedback. of course, in the true Spirit of the Game, this game would
be open to ALL skill levels of play.

happy friday,

Joel Wilson
