Subject: re: [T2] finding TDC

Another way (please correct me if I am wrong Listers) is to watch the
rockers/ valves... if you can visualize at least #1 and #2 cylinders and
move the crank (I use the alternator so I can see under and crank the engine
at the same time... at #1 TDC, the rockers are more or less stationary/
valves closed on #1, while on #3 the exhaust is just closing and intake
opening.  If reversed (#3 stationary, #1 valves/ rockers moving, the you are
#3 TDC.  Same deal for #2 and 4#; one side the exhaust will be closing and
intake will be opening and the other stationary as you are at TDC for one of
them... it takes some staring, but once you get it it's cake and pie.
