Anyone have the belly pan under their 70's series Van?

I don't, and I'm thinking the air flow over my fat and wide BA6 heater has
to be taking serious heat away from what the heat exchangers are pumping
into the system.  Seems to me the belly-pan to stop the constant air flow,
is a safer idea than gluing on insulation.

I'd be greatful if someone could tell me where the thing starts and stops,
so I could fabricate a new one.  The side to side is obvious, take it up to
the main frame rails, but I'm not sure where it should stop and start
length-wise.

Any additional tips that are obvious from looking at a belly pan would be
appreciated.  I'm going to have to live without the hatch.

thanks.
