Subject: Re: [VB] FW: new law exempts collector cars from emmissions

Hiya uj,

Is this just for the State of Arizona, or the whole country?

California already has a law that states that any car that is 25 years old 
does not have to pass an emissions test, or at least I think that's what 
it says . . .

Other states may have laws similar to this as well.

Kinda nice that finally SOMETHING works in our favor.

Peace,

Ed Richardson
