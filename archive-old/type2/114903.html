Subject: Clutch for Sure

Thanks for everyones helpful e-mails in my clutch sorrow.

I pulled my clutch cable with hopes of finding it split or coming 
apart, but its in great shape, dammit, so .....

I am going to be doing the engine drop and in preparation for the worst 
case scenario I am wondering what the ideal clutch(es) is(are) for my 
1973 4spd (+R) Manual 1700cc Safare.

I was looking at the various choices on Busdepot but I don't really 
know enough to know the pros and cons of each.

Being that the clutches seem to range from 100 to 200 dollars I'm not 
really worried about cost, I just want to get a good solid clutch that 
will stick around.

As always your input is requested ! &lt;Grin&gt;

Again,
Thanks for everyones input and kind words.

Steve
