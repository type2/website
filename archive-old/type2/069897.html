Subject: Re: What are overriders?

&gt;Someone who recently visited my web page asked me why I
&gt;didn't have overriders on my bumpers. What are overriders?

Overriders are accoutrements up with which 69 Busses and 71 Westys will not
put. ;)

They are a peculiar sort of bent pipes attached to the bumpers in splits,
intended by various accounts to:

- --give passers-by something to hold on to when they help to push the bus,

- --provide a secure place to put loads of pot when smuggling,

- --have something solid with which to push indolent cattle off the tracks, or

- --act as a rust magnet. The &quot;ferrous attraction theory.&quot;

You do not have overriders because, by God, you have a sense of decorum. ;)
