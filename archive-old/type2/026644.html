Your manual, Clymer's has been reputed to have some errors. I've always found it a good second-best to Bentley and Wilson for the early bays, but the cross-referencing, I think, is a good idea. You will find five different specifications for some things if you check five different manuals.

Thanks! Joe

&gt;Accoring to Wilson's book the peening method was not used in the Vanagon 
&gt;engines.
