Subject: RE: [T2] German parts market

&gt;&gt; I don't know much about Honda dealers, but I can tell 
&gt;&gt;  you that this is not the case with VW dealerships
 
&gt; It has been my experience with 2 different VW dealers that I 
&gt; cannot afford them. $65+ for a set of pushrod seals that the 
&gt; rest of the world sells for $16


Oh, I'm not disagreeing with you. Heck, I make my living on the fact that
dealer parts are overpriced. :-)  My point was only that it isn't the local
VW dealer who's making that profit windfall, it's Volkswagen themselves.
