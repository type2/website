&gt;Gas mileage not so good -- my old engine would give me up to 22 mpg on a

These budget rebuilds often get poor mileage from the beginning and there after. If you are getting 18mpg on the highway with the stock ignition system I think you are doing better than average.

Last year, I was asked to figure out why a JCS motor was getting 12-13mpg mileage: the engine had poor compression and cylinder head leakdown numbers even though they had been rebuilt with the engine.
