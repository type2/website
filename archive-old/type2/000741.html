Folks,

Last month I picked up a 78 bus. Since the bus is 21 years old, I thought
that it would be prudent to give the brakes some attention. Brakes are one
of those options that no vehicle should be without ;-)

The brake pads and shoes appear to be new. I was thinking about replacing
the brake fluid reservoir, master cylinder, lines and hoses, if for no
reason other than to be sure about of age. Is this overkill? Can you think
of anything else that should be changed when it is of questionable age?
(With the possible exception of the driver.)
