Subject: 69 ignition cylinder

Does anyone know if you have to have the key to remove the plug from the 
ignition cylinder?  I have the keyed part of the ignition removed, just need 
to figure out how to change out the wafers.  I have already cut the key by 
code and it didn't work so it may have already been rekeyed once.

Any help would be appreciated.

And yes I am a locksmith also, but I don't have any books on how to work on 
VW ignitions.  :(

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
