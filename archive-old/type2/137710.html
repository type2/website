Subject: Re: [T2] Replaced head,... leaks

No gasket is called for on air cooled engines. Perhaps Mike's
suggestion would help. Why do you feel the leak is at the head? Did
you check the valve seal too? Pistons?

I never drop the motor to change head. If you loosen the tin across
the front of the motor, you can remove the tin covering the head you
want to remove.

 My freshly installed rebuilt head did not seat properly or I needed a
 gasket or, I'm just not sure.  What I do know is that the replaced head
 did not have a gasket/seal installed previously. Do I need to retorque the
 head? Perhaps I needed to take some measurements beforehand to determine
 the fit.
 
 One nice thing is that the engine need not be dropped for the procedure to
 happen again. Just lower and tilt. I have an 81' Vanagon. The reason I
 replaced it was that the # 1 exhaust valve lost its seat.
 
 Can anyone provide me with some insight and suggestions? Thanks in advance.
