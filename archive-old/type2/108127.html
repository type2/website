Subject: Gas Heater - for sale

Was digging through the garage today and came across a gas heater I've been
storing for a handful of years.  It was given to me by a buddy when I still
lived in Virginia but I've got no purpose for it out here in SoCal.  Putting a
few pics of it up on a page and if someone wants to purchase it, toss me an
email and we can work out the logistics of it.  If I don't get anything from
anyone as far as purchasing goes - any hints as to what it's actually called
(never used it myself). All I know about it is the guy that gave it to me says
it's missing the glow plug, but otherwise totally functional.

Anyway, first come, first serve.  Pic files listed here are kinda large.  Got
lazy and didn't shrink them.
