Subject: TUV Approved Shocks from Bus Depot

Intalled a set up front last night. Very nice shocks. Ride is just right IMHO. I have KYB gas adjusts in the rear and these up front. Gas shocks I always found a little too harsh up front. These are oil filled and the dampening is great. Price was not bad either. So now the entire brake system from pedal to rotor/drum is new and suspension is done. Bus rides and stops great. The brakes are really good for this size/weght of vehicle when you have every component performing at 100%. Now if I could just find the time to get the body sanded...
