Subject: Re: [T2] Bringing Back A Bus

Jim(Captain&lt;grin&gt;)

I brought a 78 back after 8 years in the same type of conditions.

Anything touched by fuel will need to be taken apart depending on how much 
was in it when it died.  See the gas tank pics here 
http://www.shockwaverider_dot_com/78bustankjob/   

Look at #12 to see what came out of the tank.

Brakes would need to be totally rebuilt/restored...fluid flushed
all brake cylinders/master replaced....don't try to skimp, just do it!

Replace pads/shoes at the same time.

Yes, the brakes on mine worked ok, but one cylinder was totally 
stuck...indicative of the condition ofthe rest....master was leaking.


Cheers, dave

&gt; I'm thinking of buying another bus. The bus in question is a 1971 Westy.
&gt; When parked, it was in excellent shape. It's been sitting under an oak tree
&gt; for about 9 years.
&gt; 
&gt; I know I'll have to go through the fuel system. It will probably need new
&gt; tires and have the brakes unfrozen.
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone think of other things that might need attention after this long
&gt; time period?
