Subject: Re: [T2] returned emails

Hi Tim,

I'm not an admin, but I have had plenty of experience with that filter.

Suggestions:

1. Strip out EVERYTHING not directly related to the topic at hand.

2. Make CERTAIN to strip out the Unsubscribe/Donations info at the  
bottom of the message. The listserv will add a new one, don't worry.

3. Don't allow any extra &quot;&gt;&quot; characters at the beginning of a blank  
line. Just make the line blank.

4. If you MUST quote an extended volume of material, put it at the  
top or bottom of your post and remove all the quote marks from it.   
This should be known as the Karl procedure.

Access Bob might have some further suggestions... that filter hates  
him too.
