&gt; As for the Tank removal, if you have an upright, you have to pull the
&gt; motor, type 4 you have the option. On a type 4 motor you need to decide
&gt; how long it will take to remove the carbs or FI depending on year vs.
&gt; the time to drop the motor. I prefer to drop the motor, but its up to
&gt; you. I have both types and have done it both ways.

there is also a third way, and that is to &quot;half drop&quot; the motor, I have
done this without taking off gas lines or electric lines but watch em.  

I sling a chain hoist from my frame under my tranny at the tranny mount,
and a jack under the engine, remove the rear tranny mounts, and the rear
engine mount and allow the engine to SLOWLY lower a few inches to get
everything clear.  take off the air cleaner of course.  I have even
changed heads this way.  (this is with a type 4 engine and auto tranny,
not sure about any others)
