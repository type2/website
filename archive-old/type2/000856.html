Hello,
This Air conditioning thread reminds me. In 11 months my girlfriend and I
are packing it all in,our flat and our city jobs here in London. We are
going to have saved some good funds and are looking at interesting places to
go. Being a van man I can't think of a better way of seeing the world.
Seeing Arthur Barraclough Van of the year 1995 winner on
http://www.vwt2oc_dot_org_dot_uk/frames/index.htm and Matt Burke on
http://website.lineone_dot_net/~mpburke/ really gets me to thinking.

Anyway back to the thread. Firstly, how feasable would it be to buy a
reliable type 2 on the South West Coast and Secondly would the drive down
through Mexico to Central America be possible/fun/practical in an
unaircondition van?

I'd appreciate any ideas on this from the hordes of you who must have
experience with these areas so unfamiliar to me.

&gt; Hello out there,
&gt;
&gt; We're the people driving from Toronto to Mexico next year. We'll be
&gt; leaving
&gt; July 2nd. My concern is the intense heat experienced in the southern
&gt; states
&gt; during that time of year, especially Texas- 100 degrees+ during the day.
&gt; We
&gt; have a '76 Bus with no air conditioner and we will be traveling with two
&gt; children,
&gt; one 9 years old the other 1 year.
&gt;
&gt; I'm wondering if anybody knows of a makeshift a.c. or an alternative
&gt; a.c.
&gt; or a cheap a.c.!

People have been travelling thoughout the southwest and Mexico for
centuries without A/C.  VWs were made specifically without air
conditioning and therefore are excellent vehicles for this trip.  &quot;modern&quot;
vehicles are designed with A/C required to keep normal temps in their
poorly-vented passenger compartments.  Buses have lots of vents to keep
the air flowing!

For the kids, a couple of spray bottles and a cooler full of beverages
will make all the difference.  Keep everyone well hydrated.  Tint on the
windows and a roof rack with a shade (sheet of 1/4 plywood) will also keep
temps down.

Get in the habit of starting the day's travels early and take it easy in
the midday sun.  The habit of the &quot;siesta&quot; was born of necessity, not
sloth!

don't try to put too much driving into one day.  I've spent a lot of time
in Sonora, Mexico, and have watched many folks blasting through in their
quest to get to Mazatlan in a 1-week vacation.  four days later they are
back, looking frazzled, but with that Mazatlan T-shirt!  I think that I
had more fun staying put and enjoying the local flavor.

&quot;Wherever you go, There you are!&quot;
