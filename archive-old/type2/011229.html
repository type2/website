X-Sun-Charset: US-ASCII

	I haven't seen leaded gas here in California in a very long time.
There remain plenty of aircooled VWs however :) My '69 bus, my brother
and sister-in-law's 69 Beetle and a friend's Superbeetle all run
on unleaded. So I wouldn't run one-tank-in-five of leaded, I'd stop
with that bad stuff right now. Lead, in any form, is BAD for you and
bad for your neighbors and children. The banning of lead pigments
in paint and forbidding oil companies to add lead compounds to gasoline
represent a major advance in public health. Sadly, these bans don't
extend world-wide. Yet.

	Tetraethyl lead was added to gasoline to raise octane. Alcohol
was tried with success, but GM and DuPont realized that GM's
PATENT on tetraethyl lead as a gasoline additive offered them millions
of dollars over many years, and leaded gas, not gas blended with ethanol, 
was pushed as the route to high powered, high-compression, engines. 
The Nation ran a piece about this recently, which I highly recomend.

	Someone can correct me but haven't VW's always had steel inserts
in the aluminum heads? My understanding of engines that 'need' lead
is that it prolongs the life of straight cast-iron valve seats in
low-tech engines. Other than that, lead is a problem, not a benefit,
for engines. With GM and DuPont making a few cents FOR EVERY GALLON
of leaded gas, you can expect that a lot of BAD information about
the desirable qualities of lead was put out between the 1920s and 1970s.

	For an interesting take on chronic lead poisoning, and the reasons
that lead has been sought and used by people since before history,
see Primo Levi's &quot;The Periodic Table&quot;'s chapter on Lead. The rest
of the book is even better.
