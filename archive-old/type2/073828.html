&gt; I'm not often attracted to aftermarket parts but these are extreme.

They look very nice, but note that they seem to mount with the stock
bolts.  If you're going to take the impacts that these bumpers imply that
they can handle, you have to have a better attachment to the frame.
Otherwise, the bull bar will break loose and wipe out your sheet metal
itself.
