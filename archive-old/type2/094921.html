Flame suit zipped up tight?

Pertronix (and I have no affilitation) from my experience just keep working. 
Lets see, I have had a pertronix since 1988. Its now 2002. If I had to mess 
with my points (which always seem to go out of adjustment about every 6 
months) and need replacements every year.... I have saved:
$2.50 * 14 = $35.00 plus 28 hours of time. Hmm I think I'll sleep in 
tomorrow looks like I earned it. Besides I eliminate the need for a 
condensor, I havent even factored that in.
The buses response has always been better then with points as well. Cold 
starts are better, and the rpm curve is smoother. Dont even get me started 
talking about lack of point float. And yes even within an rpm range of 4000 
you cant beat electronic vs mechanical.
Besides, all I have to do is carry a set of points and condensor(jeez they 
take up so much space!), in case it fails. The swap takes about 15 minutes 
and then you are back to points.
