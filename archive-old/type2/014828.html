Hi all! 
Sooo, this makes me wonder. Is there any way to get a good idea of how solid 
the frame is BEFORE you put you blood and savings in it? Wondering mostly 
because, as some already know, I just picked up a 71 westie, and am about to 
replace the engine, and do very minor body work to it and get it on the road. 
I am pretty familiar with common rust spots in my Ghia, but not so with type 
2's. My body is very solid( so is the camper's!) ,as are the floors, rockers, 
and wheel wells....now I'm worried about the frame!


Thanks
Melissa
