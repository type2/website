Subject: non bronce valveguides in a T4 head?

Hello Folks!

I just came back from the rebuilder shop and i was suposed to get my T4
2000' heads from the rebuild. I told the guy to change intake valves,
sattles and guides and depending on in what shape the exaust valves would
be, those would be changed too. He did that all and he used Perkinson valves
as new intake valves. Also he switched to Mercedes Benz valveguides on each
head. I did'nt got the heads cause the valvesprings and plates were off and
i don't have the &quot;bar tool&quot; to asemble those. So my doubt right know is
first of all about if those Perkinson diesel valves will expand and contrade
(?!) the right way, i mean  not crack or something due to too much intense
changes of temperature. Perkinson is a watercooled diesel engine and it
takes some time to get those engines hot, and they wont ever run that hot
like VW engines. I don't know if i can't trust in the Mercedes Benz
valveguides either, Mercedes Benz engines are famous bout running with
stable and low water temperatures, but, when u overheat that engine you'll
get pretty fast lots of trouble and cracked heads and shit. Ok, i'm not
shure if the valveguides will actualy crack...
Probaly they won't, still maybe they could expand too much under such
circunstances and wear in the valves...  Would'nt it be nice to go somewhere
really far, like cruisin' over the highway and suddenly... All your valves
get stucked due to the overheated valveguides...
I hope this nightmare will never ocure. Tomorow i'll have to get the heads,
so what should i say to the guy??

See ya ;)

Michel
