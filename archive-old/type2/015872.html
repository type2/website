&gt;   Heck, I ran my '73 for two years in Wisconsin with a Wever -- that's
&gt;majorally more cold than NC ever got even back in the Ice Age. I never
&gt;had a problem with my Weber icing up, even at 25 below zero. I always
&gt;warmed the engine up a bit before driving off tho, which probably made a
&gt;difference. I recall my '69 used to have problems with icing -- but I
&gt;never saw it on my Weber and the 2.0L it ran on. And there wasn't any
&gt;added on heat to the carb either. Of course, I was also running without
&gt;the engine seal and a good bit of the tin, so probably the engine
&gt;compartment was warmer. 

Actually, that makes sense. It's impossible to get carb ice below 32F.

Carb ice is something that I've dealt with a lot on airplanes, and here's
the deal. 

In order for carb ice to happen, you've got to have inlet air
that has water in it. Below 32F, this water is ice already, and is stopped
by your air filter or passes into the engine (where it screws with combustion
a little, but that's beyond the scope right now.) When the air passes through
the venturi in your carb, pressure drops, velocity increases, and (here's the key)
temperature drops. This causes the entrained air to form ice IN THE SYSTEM. On the venturi and on the throttle plate downstream mostly (it's even worse at idle, because there, the throttle plate (which is mostly closed) FORMS a venturi.) This ruins the geometry of the venturi, reducing vacumn and eventually starving the engine (which 
is why it feels like you just don't have any power) Critical temps for carb icing 
are about 30-40F, but can occur up to about 70F, provided there's enough moisture
in the air.

Now, there are ways around this. You can preheat the air by electric heat
(cumbersome, but I've seen it on some airplanes), by sucking inlet air from
the area after the air is forced through the cooling fins on the cylinders (this
works, but is tricky, as sometimes, idle speed, forinstance, the heat generated 
isn't enough to melt off the ice) or by taking heat from the exhaust system (which
is what most airplanes do.) One safety note that ALL A&amp;P mechanics learn early. 
If that muffler shroud also provides cabin heat (and most do), be sure to check it
carefully for cracks. CO poisoning is no joke. I don't think VW does it this way,
but if you feel the urge to try this, be very careful (and get a CO detector - there's
a little dot you can get to stick on the dash that changes color when CO is present.
Cheap, too.)

*Lecture mode OFF*

OK, I'm done. I don't know a heck of a lot about VW's (yet), but this I know. I've
seen perfectly good airplanes make not-so-good landings in not-so-good places
because of it. Bad thing about it is that by the time anyone gets there, all the
evidence (the ice that caused the engine to fail) is gone. You then spend the next 
week trying to figure out what happened!

&quot;Fraser, there's a guy on my corner who asks me every morning if I've
seen God; do you really think he expects me to point Him out?&quot;
&quot;Well you know, Ray, if you did, perhaps he'd stop asking.&quot;
