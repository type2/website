Subject: A Few Questions

In my continuing search for 80W90 GL4 gear oil I have come up dry! NOBODY
within 75 miles of this town stocks it or knows where to get it. I checked
out the synthetics and see that they're all rated for GL5. Will these do the
same damage that dino GL5 will? I did find some straight 90 weight GL4, but
that seems a bit stiff for all-weather use. Opinions?

Unrelated, I am installing a CHT sensor under my #3 spark plug. How have
some of you handled the sensor wire coming through the tin. Up through the
spark plug hole with the plug wire? Drill a separate hole in the tin and use
a grommet? Other ideas?

One last thing: a Type 4 motor takes a 'long reach' spark plug, right?

Thanks in advance,
Dave
