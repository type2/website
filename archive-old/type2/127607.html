&gt; and pulled #1 and #2 and it ran kinda crappy on that side (not as well

&gt; So, I'm thinking maybe an exhaust leak on the driver's side?  Any 
&gt; thoughts on what to do next?

it could just be a small intake leak those intake runners are so close
to each other, a small leak could easily show up on both cyls, but the
exhaust would be trickier to have both leak. But anyway, to track down
an intake leak, I put a shop-vac in the exhaust on &quot;blow&quot; and
pressurize the system, then use you hands to feel for any leaks.
