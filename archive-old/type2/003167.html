Measure the front half moons to each other. Should be 57 1/4''. If yes, only
74 and 75 were 57 1/4''. 68 to 73 were 56 1/4''. You will need to find the
one-piece 57 1/4'' bars or find a pair of 76 to 79 two-piece collapsible.
Good luck!

&gt; I a looking for a cot for my Westy, and I have noticed that they are
&gt; listed as per years.
&gt; My question is, will a 72 cot fit a 74 ?
&gt; What year models are interchangable?
