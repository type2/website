Bummer of an update to the 'Oliver's Travels' show.  They shot up and 
burned the Squareback in episode three.  Bummer.  Bad guys in 
helicopter shot at it.  Background of a burning VW while main 
characters in foreground talking about whatever, so they REALLY did 
toast that thing, not just special effects.  Some closer shots of it 
burning too. That hurt to watch.

Vanagon in short scene of vehicles in line waiting for clearing of 
burned hulk though.

&gt; He hits the road 
&gt; in an early 70's Squareback (very good shape, though I think I 
&gt; detect a muffler leak).  Oliver is a very quirky, sometimes silly, 
&gt; definitely different character.  Hmm, does this have anything to do 
&gt; with him driving a VW, or is it the other way around?
