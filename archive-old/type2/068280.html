Same as on our '69 Westy... but I have no idea as to whether they are 
original or not... it's been around ;)

(any one know how I can find out?  it also has some other 'extras' that are 
as yet to be determined if original or as the result of customization...)

Also, on the crank placement, mine are as follows:

drivers' side: towards the back
pass.side:     towards the front

These windows are reported to be original, never removed.
