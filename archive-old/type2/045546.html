&gt; Mike Soultanian sends:
&gt;
&gt; &gt; just curious.. what's involved (cost/mechanics) in switching to
&gt; &gt; hydraulic lifters?  I have a 76 2.0 FI.
&gt;
&gt; There are two schools of thought on this--replace the camshaft, lifters
and
&gt; pushrods in your engine with hydraulic ones, and just replace the lifters.
&gt; I'll not put a dog into that fight; here are prices from Bus Depot's
&gt; website:
&gt;
&gt; Hydraulic lifters, set of 8 $79.60 ($9.95 each)
&gt; Hydraulic pushrods, set of 8 $119.60 ($14.95 each)
&gt; Hydraulic camshaft, set of 1 $139.95
&gt;
&gt; If you change just the lifters (I just went downstairs and confirmed that
a
&gt; mechanic's magnet can pull the Type 4 lifter out of the case from the
&gt; cylinder side, which means you don't have to split the case like you do on
a
&gt; Type 1) $79.60 will get you into hydraulics--not too shabby. If you're an
&gt; everything man, $349.15 just for the hydraulic lifter system.

I have not heard anyone say to just replace the lifters by them- selves. You
always need to replace the pushrods with the lifters. The pieces you also
need whether you change the cam or not are the spacers and wave and flat
washers between the rocker arms. Other than a wrecking yard engine, I have
not found these offered new by anyone. They are pictured in the 68-79
Bentley. Section 5, page 62, figure 17 - 8.
