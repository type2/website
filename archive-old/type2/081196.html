Subject: Re: [T2] alternative air filter setup.

I think the only problems with K&amp;N's would be operator error-they do have to
be cleaned and re-oiled. The oil medium is what picks up the small
particulates. The average joe is just not willing to do the extra work

&gt; &gt;Now, on my bus, I would not run the K&amp;N.  I don't need the anti-clog
&gt; &gt;property, and I am concerned about fine particulates getting into the
&gt; &gt;engine.  Better to use a filter that does a better job on all particles,
&gt; &gt;and it's hard to improve on the stock item.
&gt;
&gt; FWIW my experience on the Mustang was good.  I put a K&amp;N filter on the car
&gt; about 5-6 years ago and drove another 100k miles in that time (total of
&gt; 210k miles).  Still runs low 13's at 105mph, idles smooth and gets 25mpg
on
&gt; the highway.  If I could find a K&amp;N to fit my bus I would use it in a
&gt; heartbeat.  It's true that the K&amp;N filter element is coarse compared to a
&gt; stock paper filter, but it is also oiled.  Different filtering technology
&gt; so direct comparisons of the media are irrelevent.  One last thing to
&gt; consider - buying one K&amp;N and using it for the life of your vehicle keeps
a
&gt; lot of dirty paper filters out of the landfills.  Bottom line though - if
&gt; you're serious about your choice of air filter, read all of the
information
&gt; available and make up your own mind, and then try not to let it become a
&gt; religious matter.  To each their own.  :-)
