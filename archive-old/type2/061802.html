I've been told I can make money fast over the internet, too.  :)  Amsoil is
a good synthetic oil - so is Royal Purple.  They both might be a little
better than Mobil 1 but you can buy Mobil 1 at any Wal Mart anywhere in the
States, and Mobil 1 is cheaper ($4/quart).  Any of them are more than
adequate for a bus engine.
