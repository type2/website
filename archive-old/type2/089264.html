 &gt; I've come up with a tool that makes greasing rear wheel bearings a snap
&gt; compared to the old way, and it gets the grease completely through the
&gt; bearing, the way it should be.  This will make your rear wheel bearings last
&gt; that much longer, really they should never wear out if kept greased.

Looks to be Taylor-made for the job !
