From: Nigel A. Skeet, Great Btitain

Back in 1990, I developed a pantograph rear-window wiper for my 1973 VW 1600 
Type 2 Westfalia Continental (featured in VW Motoring magazine, December 
1996, pages 85 &amp; 86), using second-hand parts from an estate car (i.e. 
station wagon) which was manufactured by General Motors in Europe, up until 
1984.

It sweeps about 65% to 70% of the rear window area. I have one more spare 
set of components available for sale, if anyone is interested.
