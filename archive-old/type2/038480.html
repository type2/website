    I would lean towards replacing all of the brake system you have time/money
to do.  Brake fluid absorbs water which leads to corrosion in the brake lines.
Also the rubber bits in the brake system tend to deteriorate with time. At the
very least I would replace the master cylinder, wheel cylinders and brake hoses.
Also flush your brake system to ensure the crud is out of the lines and you have
fresh fluid throughout the system. Brakes are the most important things to have
working on your bus.
