Subject: Distributor/Motor ID Questions

I'm working on a Type 4 'basket case' motor.  When I got the engine (2
years ago), it was complete except for the carbs, the distributor, and
the A/C compressor.  Instead of the twin PDSIT's, it had the
manifold/runner assy for a Weber progressive.  Since this is a  long-term
 project, and I'm in no hurry, I've spent the last two years cleaning a
couple of pistons.  (Like I said, it's a  _long-term_  project!)  The
engine number (EA092288) leads me to believe it originally came from a
'71 or '72 Type 4.  Is this correct?  Also, will the PDSIT carbs used on
a Type 3 work on this engine?  (not worried about manifolds/linkage, just
wondering about the carbs...)  I've also located a couple of dual vacuum
distributors, but don't know if they'll do me any good.  One has
D412-81-106A stamped on the side, the other has 113-095-205AN.  Any
clues?  Thanks in advance for thots/ideas/suggestions!
