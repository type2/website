If a magnet on a wire or a commercial version magnet extractor won't get
it, I've tried a common table knife and bend the last 1/8 &quot; to form an L.
Stick a small mirror down there so you can see and catch the knife between
the spark plug gap and snag that sucker.

Have fun

&gt;        Hypothetically speaking, say you are changing your spark plugs for
&gt;the first time, on your '76 bus.  You read up in all the manuals, check the
&gt;web site and get the procedure straight.  You work carefully, doing the three
&gt;easy ones before moving on to the dreaded no. 2 cylinder.  As you are trying
&gt;to put the new plug in, the plug and the socket it is in fall of your wrench
&gt;and go deep inside the engine tin.  If you stand in just a certain way, and
&gt;twist your arm around in a really uncomfortable position and jam your finger
&gt;in there and twist it in ways it's not supposed to twist you can just barely
&gt;feel the end of the plug in there.  So, how would you possibly ever get it
&gt;out?  The only solutions I see are a) turn the bus upside down and shake real
&gt;hard, or b) pretend it didn't happen, get a new plug and a new socket and try
&gt;again.   Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
