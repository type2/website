&gt; &gt; Has anyone on the list ever tried to Gantt chart their engine rebuild?
&gt; &gt; (For those who don't recognize the term, a Gantt chart is a project
&gt; &gt; management tool. A google search will turn up thousands of examples.)
&gt;
&gt; I've downloaded the source and will be investigating altering it to do
&gt; daily/hourly rather than just weekly charts. I have to modify it to work in
&gt; a &quot;regular&quot; Apache environment first, he's got it all set up to run from a
&gt; single directory and all of my servers have separate /cgi-bin directories
&gt; for perl cgi modules to run in.

it is part of the OpenOffice_dot_org package, I've been playing with it the
past couple days

it's listed as &quot;project Management&quot; and is called &quot;MRProject&quot;
