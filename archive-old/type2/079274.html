Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Aux Battery systems was  Charging Spare-Beckett's tome re 
 Hella kit andwiring size

Try writing your query to Beckett himself- his addy is at the top of my
post.   I did have the problem of early spare battery death because the
deep
cycle battery never got enough juice to recharge after a weekend of
camping
and then not enough use the rest of the week- just short runs. As for
me,
when my relay died (prob the too big wire I used), I wired up 2 starting
batteries in parallel (biggest that will fit back there in terms of
amp-hr
capacity), and quit using them/run the engine  when the voltage drops to
10.8 -11 (I have an automatic 10 amp switch hooked into my electric
fridge
curcuit connector).  Should I forget or run too much, I keep a 3rd spare
battery ( a smaller one that fits in the closet or under the seatbed-
only
have used it to help others start!
     The stock Westy fridge takes 4 amps.  A high amp-capacity  I
forget;
let's say 100 amp/hrs.  That means 25 hours at 4 amps.  But since one
shouldn't run a starting batttery below 1/4 of its rated usage to expect
a
long life, that is about 7 hours- I don't know what the time would be to
get
to 10.8v, the cutoff of the automatic switch.  Running 2 batteries in
parallel would get you about 14 hours and still be able to start- and
then
you have to get the voltage back up to at least 13  to recharge both.
