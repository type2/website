Mighty, Mighty, list,

Have a friend that has removed the type 4 motor from his 72 bus, and
installed a type 1 *upright* motor.  He is looking for the tin piece/pieces
that go around the engine, that fill the space between the engine and the
frame, sealing the engine compartment.  Does anyone know where I could
find/buy this part,  NEW or USED?

I know some of the type 2s were set up this way in Mexico, Canada, and the
UK for some time.

TIA
