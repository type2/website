Subject: Casper update

Well, I have everything all welded in place, and all steel has been chem 
treated for putting on filler and primer today. The battery tray and the 
weld to the support beam came out really great and totally beyond what I 
thought might be achieved.

The Bondo will be extremely thin as the metal has formed quite nicely, and 
all metal is in good shape. It will not be used as filler, but just used as 
a surface smoothing. It will only be required in a very small area. All 
other surface finishing can be achieved with high build primer.

I took the engine hatch that I found in the Yukon, and completely treated 
the interior cavity area with chemical, much as would be done to a fuel 
tank. It is solid and has nothing on it but surface rust. Any interior 
cavity rust is now eradicated and converted.

Looking to start painting tomorrow, and then on to the real detail work in 
the engine compartment before I put Casper's completely checked out engine 
back in.

I have taken many pictures, and will post these later.

I feel really good about getting beyond this whole ordeal of my bus being 
banged, and I am truly finding it hard to accept that the repairs are going 
to be so excellent as for them to not even come close to being considered a 
&quot;patch job&quot;.
