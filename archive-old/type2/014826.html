Hi Volks!

Sorry for crossposting, but I think you might enjoy this -- plus it 
comes from the Bay list but has Splitty content.  :-)

You remember the idea to deface the L*xus &quot;tank ad&quot; by pasting in a 
VW Bus and change the caption?  Here's my attempt on it.  Mark 
Hineline provided the idea, Tobin Copley the ad scan, Everett Barnes 
the Web site from which I shamelessly nicked the Bus image, and yours 
truly did nothing but cobble it all together quite hastily.

Check it out:
http://www.bulli_dot_org/erik/suv.html

This is a sort of secret link, i.e. linked to from nowhere.  Please 
keep it like that -- you never know what a certain Japanese auto 
maker might think of it.  ;-)  You're welcome to mirror the images 
elsewhere; in fact I'd love you to.  The images are to be considered 
public domain for all practical purposes, i.e. as far as I can rule 
them to be.

Now, if anyone can make it better, feel free to do so, and I'd gladly 
host the results.  And if anyone has a Bay bus image that fits 
perspective-wise, I'd be more than glad to do (and/or host) a Bay 
version of this!  But please do not send large images (above 100 k) 
to my e-mail address or webmaster_at_bulli_dot_org -- e-mail me for an 
address that can handle stuff like that.

Enjoy!  Happy week-end to all of you.  You're a grand bunch!

Airhowlingly yours,
    Erik.
