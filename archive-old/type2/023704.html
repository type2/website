&lt;&lt; .... do you work on automatics??  &gt;&gt;

Hello,

Not at this time, however, I been in a few when I worked for
Mr. VW.  He isn't exactly mid-Atlantic but you might try
the Bus Depot for a brand new automatic.  Ron had a couple
with TC's for $1395????  Check with him to make sure on
exact application and price.  

If you are dead set on a rebuilt unit then I'd try German Transaxle
Exchange in Bend, OR.  Good workmanship from what I've 
seen.  

Perhaps I should start doing the automatics as well??  ;)
