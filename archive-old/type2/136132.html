Subject: Re: [T2] Cylinder Head Paint &lt;-- The Original Subject Was
  &quot;paint for cylinders.&quot;

I'm uncertain how painting my cylinders morphed into painting my heads.
:) 

My heads and (ack) jugs went to the machine shop. The heads were done
and look fantastic. The cylinders were checked out and bored for the 
next step in rings. I'm waiting on a few parts and have been reading 
about rebuiling type 4s as the wait drags into weeks.

I am mildly concerned about how the bottom end is going to hold up, but 
will cross that bridge when I get to it.

The only things I'm considering painting are my cylinders. Wilson and
Hoover seem to be good sources of information, but, I'm sufficiently
ignorant and scared to ask for second and third and fourth opinions from
anyone who has painted his or her cylinders with regards to whether or
not it was perceived as beneficial. I'd also like some recommendations
on paint to do this cylinder painting job.

I definitely don't want to muck things up; but, if a few dollars in 
paint and an extra day on an already ridiculously drawn out rebuild will 
buy me some extra engine life, I'm ready to spend the day and the lunch
money.
