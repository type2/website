Subject: 83 type 4 aircool rebuilded , what elese I should replace ?

Good morning,
I am reposting my email , because I noticed that when I sent an email at 
2am, nobody answer ! ;-)

I am about to rebuild my 2000cc type 4 aircool engine + transmission
The engine got 120000 miles on it
I am looking now to see what else I could  change (like seals , clutch , 
hoses, fuel filter , etc ....)  to be sure that my new engine will work 
perfectly and to be sure that I won't have to fix the engine every month 
because of some other parts failure which should  have been replaced a 
long time ago or won't last an another 10000 miles.

People in this newsgroup are great, thanks to all  !!!! ;-)

Chris
