Subject: Re: micrometers

&gt;Having worked in machine shops for years, believe me, a dial caliper is
&gt;good to
&gt;0.001 inch. A mic is good to 0.0001 if it is marked with a veriner; 0.0005
&gt;without.

I did check the thing against a few feeler gauges once, and it fell in
perfectly. That ain't philosophical proof--the caliper and the feeler could
both be wrong--but it's a hop, skip and a jump toward scientific proof,
which means that it is likelier than any proposed alternative. ;)

I don't think I'd feel comfortable with a measuring device that produced
different results if the air conditioning was turned on. Ten-thousandths
are a bit much for engine building, aren't they? I have scales at work that
will go bonkers if you exhale toward them (no kidding) and they are a big
pain in the butt.
