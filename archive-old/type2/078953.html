Here is a problem that I don't doubt will be easily identifiable to =
those with more experience and knowledge than me (I'm referring to =
everyone else on this list given the caliber of technical info I see in =
just about every posting):

1) I have a '70 westy=20
2) It can be difficult to shift into first
3) There is a god awful rattling through certain RPMs - sometimes
4) When I disengage the clutch (regardless of gear, even neutral) the =
rattling will stop (mostly - the humming part)

Amy ideas/suggestions?

Thanks,

Juan
