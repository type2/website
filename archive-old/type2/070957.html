&gt; A &quot;D&quot; rating is around 1700 lbs per tire, and I'm not sure I know of any 
&gt; proper fitting tires in the &quot;D&quot; rating, other than the Michelin Agelis 61, 
&gt; which doesn't seem to be available this side of the Atlantic.
&gt;  &gt; &gt; http://www.michelin_dot_com/us/eng/news/agilis/1.htm

Here in Portland, OR, &quot;America's Tire Co.&quot; carries the Yokohama Y356, a D 
rated tire in the correct 185 R14 size.  The tire is listed as a Vanagon 
tire, and it also comes in a 195 R14 size.  It is replacing the old Yokohama 
Y370 model that was &quot;original equipment&quot; on some light trucks through 1991.  

They guarantee they will match the cheapest price on the tire anywhere else.
