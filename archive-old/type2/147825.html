Seconded.  My '72-'74 style Bugpack extractor has gotten horribly 
rusted in the 1.5 years I've had it on my daily-driver Westy.  I've got 
a couple of spares though, so at this rate I'll probably be fine until 
2007.

Ceramic coating would make the aftermarket stuff last a lot longer, 
but the cost of extractor+muffler+coating is comparable to buying 
the stock-style muffler in the first place.
