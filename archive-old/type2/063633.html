Subject: Westy Plaid Fabric - Anyone get theirs?

I was one of the people who was supposed to buy the Westy Fabric from John Anderson that he bought 
from the Trim Shop (I think).  Well that was quite a few months ago.  I know John is on the list 
because I see posts from him several times a week.  However he is either not getting the e-mail I send 
him or he is just ignoring it.

Did anyone actually get the fabric from him?  Has anyone heard from him?  Does anyone have an address 
for him other than vwbus_at_netbiz_dot_net?  I've been trying to get a hold of John for a month or two now 
and have had no luck.

Sorry to waste list bandwidth but I figured someone other than the people who were buying this fabric 
might be able to help me out.
