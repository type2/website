&gt;My 72 bus, just bought and towed home.  Im trying to start it.  
&gt;New battery with cables, I turn the key and the lights dim very 
&gt;slightly but I hear no starter sounds.  I had a friend tow me 
&gt;while I tried to pop the clutch.  I was unsuccessful.  In fact the 
&gt;tires just locked and dragged.  I got no engine turn over... Any 
&gt;ideas.....

&gt;From your description, it seems likely that your motor has a thrown rod.
You might be lucky and just have the pistons rings rusted to the cylinders,
but I'd put my money on a thrown rod.  

First thing I'd do is remove all 4 spark plugs, put the bus in neutral, and
try to turn the motor by hand (wrench on the alternator nut should do it).
If it won't turn over, you might as well get ready to remove the engine for
a rebuild.  Sorry to be the harbinger of doom, but that's the way I see it.
