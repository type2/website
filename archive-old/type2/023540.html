Hiya Fred,

This hits close to home for me on two counts, maybe.  

I too have a 70 Bus and all of it (except the engine) is original.  I can 
imagine how you feel.  The senselessness of an act like this is what I would 
find so aggravating.  To intentionally destroy something of value, something 
which is cherished by another shows a lack of compassion which is, at the 
very least, appalling.

About the second count, I have a feeling you may have been describing UPS.  
Am I (hopefully not) correct?
