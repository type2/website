Subject: 69 not running well

This is only my second posting, and I hope someone can help.

My 69 westy was running fine 2 days ago.  After putting a fresh a tank of
gas in, it began running horribly.  It seems to have lost some power, and
the engine is running much louder, sounding as if the muffler was no longer
in existance.  However, I can find no holes in the exhaust system, and
everything seems to be in tact.  Last night I replaced all of the plugs and
they are gapped correctly.  I also replaced the points in the distributor,
and none of this helped.  Yesterday, before all of the problems started, i
got in and started it up and i knew instantly that there was a problem.  I
ran back to the engine, and noticed fuel leaking from the fuel filter down
into the distributor.  I clamped the hoses to avoid this problem in the
future, but I do not know if some type of damage occured.
The dist. is a vaccume advance type which I was planning on replacing with
a .009.  Could my vaccume advance failing cause hese problems?  I just
don't understand why it is running so loud, and has lossed some power.  If
anyone might know, please shed a little light.  Since I am knew to this
automotive repair, I don't quite know how to trouble shoot.  Is bad gas
enough to cause my bus to run this poorly?  If so, how do I get rid of the
bad gas?  I know there are many knowledgable folks on this list, and I hope
you can give me some insight.  Thanks.

David
