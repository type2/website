Subject: 2.0l rebuild

thanks for the replys so far, I think solid lifters is where I will start, 
maybe stick with the 94mm, but I was talking to a guy at fast auto today and 
he said 96mm with a strocker crank were the way for power, he said cams just 
give you a different power curve. I want smooth power through out but good 
power, no overheating problems, and not to much work. If I use a strocker 
crank how much clearancing will be needed and is this something to do at 
homeshop or send out. If I were to go with a cam what is suggested and who 
carries it.
