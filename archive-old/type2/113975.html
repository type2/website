&gt;I just got my O2 sensor installed and hooked up to a new A/F meter.  According to the gauge, I am running rich most of the time.  This is on a my 2.0 haydraulic with Dual 36 dells.  (135 mains, 190 A/C, 60 idle 50 pump)

&gt;Is it normal to run rich like this for an aircooled?  I am worried about leaning it out to the 14.7:1 and causing burnt vavles or something. 

Yes, it is probably normal.  The problem is that with your gauge it is nearly impossible to tell how rich your are running.  It could be 14-to-1 or 10-to-1.  Your O2 sensor is only good at detecting stoich (14.7-to-1) and has no resolution on either side of that.  It is okay to run at 14.7-to-1 at idle and very light throttle but you should run richer than that if your engine is under any significant load.  Supposedly 12.8 is ideal for power production.
