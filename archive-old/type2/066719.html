Subject: 75 Campmobile Brochure Question

This is very silly but when looking at the cover of the brochure mine
looks as though the bus has that rust line that comes down the side by
the gas cap.  I know everyone has seen this on real busses but can
someone check out their brochure and see if this is not a figmant of my
imagination.  Kind of strange!
