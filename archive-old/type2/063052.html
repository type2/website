&gt; 
&gt; &gt;breathing apparatus is the way to go (not one of those .99 dust masks). Why
&gt; &gt;not error on the side of caution, it is your brains, lungs etc??? I can't
&gt; &gt;understand why people would wanna breathe that stuff in?? If anyone wants
&gt; 
Here are some tips, isocynates are not anywhere near new or soley
relegated
to POR-15 if indeed that product contains them.  They originated on the
auto
world with the advent of most of the urethanes and urethane hardeners
for
acryllic enamel easily 10-20 years ago now.  Are they dangerous, sure,
have
people been spraying without any masks at all using them for years,
sure.
A smart road is in between.  If I were brushing a product containing
them out
of a can, I'd hardly worry about more than a quality filter style
respirator,
with organic vapor cartrige.  For occasional spraying with them I have
used
such a mask in fact though usually use a better mask from the local
paint shop
custom made for the purpose (refill inserts about $40 a pop).  Now if I
were
really serious, there has been a company in HMN's advertising a total
fresh air
mask system for $369 for some time now, Fastech Corp, 1-800-462-2471.  I
am
likely going to buy one in fact for sand blasting and painting.  Another
alternative
I have been exploring though is rolling my own with one of the new
semi-scuba
style regulators that are out where you &quot;scuba&quot; with an attached high
pressure
air hose run off a teflon ringed compressor.  Any way around it be safe
but
don't flip out and buy $400 worth of protective equipment to brush paint
out in
the open air.

On the subject of POR-15 I have only tried their high heat stuff and
have been
slightly less than satisfied, though admittedly I did not prep the parts
as
suggested.  On the new '85 exhaust I merely removed the factory primer
with solvent
and roughed with steel wool as I had no place to sandblast inside in
February.
The POR-15 has not adhered well whatsoever, but now that I picked up a
grit blast
cabinet I will likely retry the procedure but have been too lazy to take
that SOB
of an exhaust off again.

Anyway YMMV
