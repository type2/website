I think that the key fact is that the _public_ point of contact for
the &quot;retirement program&quot; is selected wrecking yards.  Despite the fact
that the wreckers would _rather_ put the &quot;retired&quot; cars out for parts,
they are forced to take them directly to the crusher.  It wouldn't
cost the AQMD a dime more to let the wreckers do with the cars
whatever they want, but obviously their goal isn't to help _anyone_
keep an older vehicle on the road.

Another interesting fact is that the worst polluting vehicles do not
qualify for the program.  In order to qualify, the vehicle has to be
currently registered, and if it can't pass smog the vehicle probably
isn't.  Nevertheless, these vehicles are running about every day, as
often their owners cannot afford any alternative.

I read in the paper today that California has $25,000,000 in a fund
that was supposed to help low-income people get their cars into
compliance. This money came from the $300 out-of-state vehicle fees
that are currently being disputed in the courts.  In the last two
years a total of _79_ people have applied for assistance in the entire
state.  Doing the obvious math shows that we could have bought a new
Bentley for each of these low income folk and had money left over!

So, the program's a failure and will be ended, right?  Not on your
life!  The current plan is to charge everyone $2 more on their smog
certificate fee if the $300 out-of-state vehicle fee is overturned. 
The state says that the big problem is getting garages to tell
consumers about the availability of the assistance, as it smacks of
&quot;big brother&quot;. (and they don't think smog test machines wired directly
to Sacramento and roadside sensors aren't &quot;big brother&quot;??)
