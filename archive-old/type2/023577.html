Subject: acceleration woes
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

&gt;Today I performed a slightly overdue tune-up: oil change, valve clearances 
reset, &gt;timing was reset at 8 degrees before TDC as opposed to 10 degrees 
after (on the &gt;advice of a VW mechanic of great experience) and the  idle 
speed and carb &gt;mixtures were reset . The engine idles a little smoother now 
but as soon as the gas &gt;pedal is depressed the aforesaid symptoms are still 
there. 

Before Fiddling with the accelerator pumps, check the numbers written on the 
side of your distributor. Write them down and compare them to the numbers on 
the tune up 
page of the Rocky Mountain Motorworks catalog. Make sure you know exactly 
which distributor you have, then you'll know for sure where the timing should 
be (before or after Tdc, and how far, also make sure from the same page that 
you bought the right tune up parts for the distributor you have) Then put the 
timing in the right spot, then test drive again. If the problem persists, 
then look to fuel delivery and accel pump.
