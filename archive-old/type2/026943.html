Subject: HFH - Brake Fluid

Hint From Heloise::

Is your brake fluid a little low??

Before you fill up the reservoir, check your front brake pads, if you are a 
late bay.  It could be that the pads are excessively worn, and just need 
replacement.

The story behind the story::

I just replaced the front brake pads on my non-VW car.  The fluid reservoir 
WAS significantly down, but when I compressed my pistons (on each caliper), 
the fluid went right back up to the top.

This had to be at least 2 oz of fluid that was 'missing' in the reservoir.

If my reservoir WAS full before the pad replacement, this brake fluid would 
have had to come out, either before or DURING the caliper compressions.
