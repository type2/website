Subject: scraping noise / brake adjustment
Message-ID: &lt;6F2B41A97BD1D211850900606DD5F08A4EF79D_at_MSTDCFNT01&gt;

Well, I'm getting a bit more familiar with my bus now  (it's my first Type-2
remember).
But a few questions (again I did try the archives and found similar
questions, but I didn't find the answers)

1)  While driving along there is a slight scraping noise from somewhere, -
it sounds *exactly* like a brake shoe rubbing on a drum.  (It has a resonant
'ringing' quality to it too.)  BUT,  get this, the tone of the noise changes
when I put my foot on the clutch !?   How could this be ?   Incidentally the
noise is dependant (and varies with) forward motion - not engine speed.
Any ideas ???

2)  I have had difficulty locating the front brake adjusting hole(s)  - on
the front right-hand side I found one hole - at 12-O'clock in the back of
the backplate - but I couldn't find the adjusting wheel - (although I can
see the brake lining quite well)    Muir says that there ought to be one
hole at the top and one at the bottom - there is *definitely*  *no*
*bottom*  *hole*  !???   Where should I be looking ???

Thanks again
