Subject: Why dwell would vary with RPM?

I was doing some tune up stuff on &quot;Babcia&quot; (1600 SP) today in preparation for
Everybus. After the valve adjustment I started her up and found the dwell to
be 55. I did not really want to mess with it as the points are a nightmare to
set on that thing. The plate were the points attach is bent slightly making
fine adjustment very difficult. The dizzy is a rebuilt unit (Bosch 0231 137
009 vacuum advance only) and it came that way but I noticed it too late to
return it.



I talked with Steve Dolan and he talked me into getting the point gap more
accurate. I pulled the dizzy and set the points exactly at .016. When
reinstalled, the dwell was at 48. Close enough for me. After setting the
timing I decided to recheck the dwell and it was 46. What the &amp;$*# ??  This
time I tried to fine tune the point gap with the dizzy installed. Again it
appeared to be .016. Started up and still about 46, but I noted that when I
increased the RPM the dwell went to 49.5??



Any input? I am tired and confused. I have a spare 009 but one of the return
springs is broken so have no idea what the advance curve will be.
