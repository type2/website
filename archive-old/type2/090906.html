&gt; Hi Listees;
&gt;    Art Lynch here in Texas attempting (yet) another long distance rescue

Volks,

An update.  Nikki and I had a series of discussions this afternoon while
she tried a couple things.  She got the bus stumbling and got back to her
campsite of last night (an RV park north of El Paso).  As a result, she is
safe and sound for the moment.

What she has done is to check dwell, which was way off and tried to reset
it.  While checking it, she noticed that the points were burnt, so she
went to replace them and the capacitor.  Alas, she has the right points
but the wrong capacitor in her spares kit.  She put in the new points and
set dwell well enough to get back, but she also had a problem rotating the
shaft of the distributor, it was sticking badly at 180 intervals.  I had
her pour some oil in the lube hole and that helped, so she was OK to drive
the 10-20 miles back to Oliver.  Alas, I agree that the dist bearings are
dying.

Her current plan is to go into town tomorrow and buy a new dist, probably
an 050 or 009 just to get her home.  She had pulled and put the dist a
couple times now and she is good at points, so I have no fear on that
score, but I know zilch about El Paso.  If Leo from the AIRS list (she has
a message on your machine) could get in touch with her, it would be much
appreciated!

I have noted Oldschoolvw's competition motors recommendation.  If anyone
has any other VW parts shops in/near El Paso (northwest side preferred),
it woudl be deeply appreciated!!!!
