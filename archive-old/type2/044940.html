Subject: [T2] Mark Kaylor's '78 Bus

Volks,

Remember the bus that Mark Kaylor bought up in Pennsylvania and could not
get started?  Well, I bought it from him when he ran out of time/energy.
I am sorry that he didn't get it running, but now I am in the process of
diagnosing and repairing it to the point that it will travel down to my
place for further repairs.  I went up and looked it over this past
weekend, took some pics and they are at:

It is a 1978 Wolfburg edition passenger bus.  

The body has typical problems (doglegs, nose ding, etc.) but it appears to
be in fair condition.  The rear bumper is rusted thru in a couple places.
There is no major damage that I can see.  Alas, I forgot to inspect the
front axle beam for rust.

The Wolfsburg interior is in very good condition, except for the front
seats which, as usual, have lost their horsehair :-)  All  the original
carpet is present and not too dirty

The biggest problem I see with the engine (other than the missing seal :-)
is that the wiring harness for the fuel pump has been rather crudely
&quot;customized :-( If anyone has one of these harnesses in their basement, I
would love to hear from you!  otherwise, the engine looks tight and dry
(tho it has not run in a couple years, so who really knows :-)

I *think* I may now possess the rarest of the rare in bay window parts,
BTW...  a Wolfsburg (funky reddish brown) radio block-off plate :-)
