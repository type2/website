Greetings all,
    I just resubscribed and currently have a '69 Riviera daily driver and a
'78 with its engine strewn all over my house.  On to my question...I need
info from anyone who has experience pulling a trailer with a Bus.  I'm
looking at pulling about 1000 pound trailer for a month or so while on
vacation.  My '69 is nicely sorted out and I think it is up to the task, but
I'd like to hear from anyone who has done any trailering with their early
bus.  Thanks all
Russell
