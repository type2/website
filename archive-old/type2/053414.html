Subject: which spark plugs? '79 2L dual carb

Dear All,

I don't seem to be able to get hold of the right spark plugs nor find out 
what I actually need.

I have a 1979 2 liter stock dual carb (solex)
It was build for the german market and therefor does not have the injection 
system.
What plugs should I be using.
Since Bently is not clear on this?


thanks
