Subject: RE:  AVP/Bus Depot Engine Problem

Kevin:

I too have a '79 with an engine rebuild from AVP and had a distributor
problem, though I'm not sure that its the same as yours.  I could start my
bus, however I could not time it properly.  I couldn't rotate the
distributor enough since the vacuum advance cannister on the distributor
would hit the cold start injector, preventing any further advance.  If I
repositioned/advanced the distributor drive shaft 1 tooth, then I could not
get enough retard with the vaccum advance hitting the fan housing.  I'm not
sure what the reason for this would be.  The engine block was the the stock
original that I sent in to AVP for rebuild.  The FI busses with dual vaccum
advance really have very little room for rotating the distributor.  I also
got no answers from AVP, and yes, Leonard was nearly impossible to reach
and did not return calls.  However, so far, I'm reasonably satisfied with
the engine and the work AVP did.

In your case, if your distridistributor drive shaft is indeed 180 degrees
out, it would seem as if your mechanic should realize that all that is
required to correct this problem  is to pull the distributor drive shaft
and re-install it in the correct position.

With my engine, I was not able to reposition my drive shaft so that I could
time the car as per specification (5 deg ATDC, '79 cal spec).  I had to
redrill the distributor shaft so that I could re-mount the drive lug 15
degrees relative to its original position on the distributor shaft (the
equivalent of one-half tooth of the distributor drive shaft).  This cost me
$100 at a local machine shop and works fine.  If you need a drawing of this
mod, let me know and I can email it.
