Hello! I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm from Seattle, and today I
bought my second bus. My first bus was a '73 (i think) pop top camper. I
bought it for $1500, and in a year spent $1000 on it. I sold it a year later
for %1200. :) The bus mechanic down the street (Ken from The Bus Co.) says
that it sounds like a typical bus story.

So, fast forward to the present. I'm 24, and I want to learn all about
buses. Right now I think I can figure out how to change the oil. Today I
bought a '78 pop top. It barely runs. There's something wrong with the
brakes, I think. Also, the muffler is awful and the you can't ride in it for
very long without feeling like you're going to faint from the fumes. But I
love it. The body is extremely clean, only a teensy amount of rust on the
corner of the passenger door. The inside is great. 

I have a million questions, but I'm going to start surfing the archives
before I ask a lot of them. However, I did want to put out there that I am
*very* eager to learn mechanical &quot;stuff&quot;. I want to be able to take long
road trips with some spare parts, and be able to fix what comes up along the
way. If there's anyone in Seattle who would want to help me out with this, I
would be willing to pay them with money, cookies, beer, pretty much whatever
you can think of (within reason, hehe). Ken says he'll show me basic stuff,
but he's very busy and I was hoping to find a more informal arrangement. 

Off to surf the archives and get my bus trip-worthy, (also to find it a
name!)
