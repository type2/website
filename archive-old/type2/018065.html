Hey....enough mumble jumble with all of this technical crap...I know its
necessary...but lets get done with it for the summer.
Who wants to go camping??  I'm going on a road trip this summer ( I live
in mid-wisconsin) at the end of july....and need someone who wants to
go!  I would really like to go out east...but I don't know how Stella is
going to like the hills... that...or Canada!  I would love to go to
canada!  That is if anyone knows any good camping or would offer
hospitality.... Well...either way...this summer is a road trip... I'm
very open minded so if someone doesn't want to go that way....I'll go
somewhere else...just a suggestion..
It would be ultra cool if we could get a convoy going! just a thought.
P-mail me back if interested...
I'm a little on the eccentric side...but hey...who isn't? Yet....very
nice and completely harmless...you could kick my ass..hehe  open minded
like any other bus owner...any ways....get back to me!
