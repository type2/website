&gt; Hmmmm... I'd say that the presence of a 1/2&quot; square hole in the proper
&gt; location militates against their being &quot;designed for hammering&quot;:-), though
&gt; I'm sure that some folks do it this way.

No, they really are designed for hammering. Stick your breaker bar in the
half-inch hole and beat on the device with the 5-lb sledge in your right
hand.

If you try turning the nut off without a hammer, you will break your breaker
bar right in half. It's not a pretty sight.
