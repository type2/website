Subject: Re: [T2] Towing 69 Bay sans engine

Glenn,

I've used a coat hanger to hold the tran up before...or maybe two of them.

Might be easier to leave the engine alone, disconnect the cv joints at the 
wheels, hang them up with some wire and just rock and roll....

After hearing several horror stories lately about vehicles being towed 
poping in to a gear, this might be the fastest easiest safest way to do 
it.

Cheers ,dave

&gt; T2 List friends,
&gt;                  I have a 69 Bay, original throughout.  Thinking about pulling 
 the engine before towing the vehicle 400 miles.  In the splitty Type 2, the 
 trans bellhousing end was supported by a cross member.  But in the Bays 
 (correct me if I'm wrong) the rear of the ENGINE is supported on a transverse 
 hanger.  So Im going to need to fabricate some kind of support to keep the 
 trans in a 'normal' position... right?
&gt; 
&gt; Next I would change oil in the trans and rig-up lights and towbar... what else 
&gt; do I need to think about?  Thanx, Glenn
