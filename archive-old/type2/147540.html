Subject: Re: [T2] 17's for your Bay?

Hi Chris,

Sure you could.... throw a set of 235/65R17s on there and your  
sidewall depth will be the same size as it is now. And with the tires  
being almost four inches taller you'll enjoy an two inches of ground  
clearance, which can't hurt offroad. You'd probably need to jack the  
suspension up a bit to improve tire clearance, which would put the  
bus even further up in the air. Woohoo!!!

Time to get back to the Baja bus list!



Happy trails,

&gt; Actually look pretty good. Couldn't take them far off road as the  
&gt; sidewall would be pretty short...
