Subject: [T2] Parking Brake Part NEEDED

Posted this once before, I think, but do not recall seeing it get out.

I am in need of:
for 1970 bus, rear brakes, left hand side, following item:

Connecting Link
(The flat notched plate that is used to actuate the brake shoe outward 
for the parking brake cable lever)

I finally got around to investigating why I did not have any actuation 
on my left rear brake when the parking brake was engaged (1/2 engaged) 
............ Damn !!

Anybody got one of these, know where to get, whatever ??
Damn !!
