&gt;Hi all:
&gt;
&gt;I was puzzled why it was so darned hard getting the battery out of the
&gt;Westfalia until I realized it's a Group 42 battery, not the smaller Group 41
&gt;battery in the regular air-cooled Vanagon.  Is this what's supposed to be
&gt;there, or did a PO shoehorn in a too-large battery?

I think that's backwards. Group 41 is the large battery and group 42 is the small one. 

I don't know about the Vanagon layout but getting the small battery out isn't a picnic either.
