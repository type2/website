Subject: Broke Down

I was driving down the road when suddenly a strange rumbling noise came from 
the bus and dust blew out from the vents near the windshield ( the heating 
levers were down).The bus turned off.I pulled over immediately and parked the 
Bus.I looked at the engine and I noticed that the belt was slightly twisted near 
the generator.I will not moved the bus until I get some information (advice). 
Very strange incident, with that dust coming out of the vents.Did not appear 
to be smoke.The engine did not appear hot. Any advice will be appreciated.
             Sincerely
         Vincent Moreno
