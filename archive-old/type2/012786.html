&gt;&gt; As far as I can tell, the Westy interior for 1968 was the same
&gt;&gt; for 1969, so maybe a new manual was not published for 1969 (my best guess
&gt;&gt; as to why none can be found).

&gt;That wouldn't surprise me. I'm quite certain there was not one made for 1971,
&gt;but rather the 70 book was supplied instead. It said &quot;Campmobile 70&quot; on it.

FWIW, the plate on my 71 westy's bed says &quot;Campmobile 70&quot; BUT the plate on the full-width bed I pulled from a mid-70's hardtop westy says &quot;Campmobile 80&quot;.  I'd 
assumed 70/80 were model numbers, not related to YOM.  Memory fails, but this may have been discussed previously.

The overhead net vs. headbanger question is probably resolved in the Campmobile parts manual.  Mine's not handy.  Biggest variation during 68-71 was sink and 
jumpseat details.  I agree the cargo net is much cooler than the cabinet - my 68 had the net; 71 has the cabinet.  

FWIW, the hardtop westy I took the bed from had a headbanger cabinet with a door in it.  Since the hardtop doesn't have the sliding roof pocket, there's more 
headroom; hence this cabinet is taller &amp; won't fit a poptop.  I'd be willing to part with it for anyone fairly local (too big to ship easily).  I'm in North FL -- maybe hook up 
at the Jax show in 3 weeks if you're interested.  $ or trade for NOS &quot;big top&quot; tent. ;-)
