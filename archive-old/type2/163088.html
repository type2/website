Subject: AC

First of all and to make it just a bit bus related: I had to work on
the other car since the bus has been so reliable lately that it needs
no attention. I come to the list because I do not know of any other
awesome place like this one &lt;end of bus content&gt;

On a 1995 Golf 2.0l. AC did not work, brought to shop a year back,
they refilled system, checked for leaks with dye and found no leak. AC
clutch was engaging, AC light in AC button turns on but AC on does not
make the air colder so they said I need new compressor for 650$. Back
then I knew nada about AC and I should have asked about their pressure
reading on high side to confirm that compressor was faulty! System
seems leak free since it still had good pressure last week when I
started working on it.

Last week I was bored since bus runs great and needs no fix. Got
rebuilt AC compressor on ebarf for 170$ shipped. Had the system
discharged at my local auto shop (35$ !) because I did not feel like
letting 1lb of R-134a in the CA air. Over the week end, Installed new:
AC compressor, receiver/drier, control valve. (and timing belt but
that has nothing to do with it)

When time came to fill the system it seems to take a very small amount
of freon (1/3 lb) until the pressure gauge reads 35psi (fully
charged). AC clutch kicks in, air blower blows, cold-warm air flap
works but still no cold air in the car. I do not have a high pressure
reading gauge (yet)

Could it be :
- a blockage somewhere in the evaporator or radiator ?
- installed the control valve in the wrong direction ?
- what else

Any advice ? Taking it to a shop would feel like failure :-)

thanks folks
