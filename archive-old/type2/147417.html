Subject: Anyone got a good schematic of the cooling setup for my 77
  Westy?

So the P.O. Took off my cooling system obviously, because I can't find
anything but the flaps left on it. I need to know what parts it's going to
take to set up my cooling system properly. I assume I will need a thermo
bracket, pulley, and whatever else it takes to mount these. I have a new
Type1 thermostat and cable and the spring mounted flaps, which like Don's
aren't particularly keen on springing back wide open, they stick. An
exploded diagram would be helpful in my figuring this out. Anyone seen a
good one online? Is this why I don't have any heat in the Westy? It never
gets to operating temp?
