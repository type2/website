&gt; I recommend sand blasting - much more friendly to mother earth -
what do
&gt; you do with 5 gallons of a phosphoric acid liquid after cleaning
parts? 
&gt; I don't even use that stuff on my toilet.

Do you drink it?  Check the ingredients in a can of Coca Cola!  I'll
bet that more phosphoric acid finds its way into the sewers via unused
portions of Coca Cola than ever do from other uses of the stuff.

Phosphoric acid (and for that matter other acids) tend to react with
other stuff pretty readily, which is why it's an effective cleaner. 
When run down the drain it tends to get diluted pretty rapidly to safe
levels.

One caution:  Always pour acid into water, not the other way around. 
If you pour water into acid, it can react rapidly and splatter the
acid about.
