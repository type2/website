&gt; I thought I'd test at the bulbholder with my multimeter.
&gt; Which setting do I use and what do I look for?
&gt; I tried DC voltage and continuity, and neither one gives me valid readings.

Use D.C. range that accomodates 12 v. ( could look like 10-20 v.d.c. ).
No Valid readings ? Voltage/ continuity or both ?
Is your meter analog ( needle) or digital ( LCD ) ?
If you find live voltage source while searching for continuity, your meter
will blow a fuse, so let's start there ! Check for 12 v. at the battery.
If no voltage read on a good battery, open the meter and check the fuse.
( it's the only one in there ).
Test for continuity on &quot;ohms&quot; scale, touch the leads together at the meter.
Does that work ? Begin testing at the highest range ( least sensitive ) e.g.
RX10K. Never touch voltage with the meter set for continuity- always test
an unknown source for voltage first.
Remember, Big Fat Red wires are supposed to be Hot !
