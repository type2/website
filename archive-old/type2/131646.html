Subject: Re: [T2] sleeping in a Bay Bus

Hi Folks,

For $50.00, you can get a Therm-A-Rest self-inflating mattress that's thick 
enough to keep you comfortable when sleeping on the ground.  If you use one 
of those in your Bus, it should make a pretty comfy bed when combined with 
the original foam (even if it's in bad shape).  Check your local FLCS 
(Friendly Local Camping Store) or www_dot_campmor_dot_com

The other option is a &quot;frame up&quot; resto of your bed.  Mattress &amp; textile 
supply shops have foam in various thicknesses, Bus Depot and GoWesty have 
upholstery kits, and the Type2 Library or Archives have info regarding 
removal and reinstallation of bed &amp; foam.

Good Luck!
