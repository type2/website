Subject: Ceramic Heaters

Craig &amp; The List,
   The subject of these ceramic heaters came up last year. Save your money, these things dont work. The amount of heat they put out is minimal. It won't defrost your windshield, and it sure as hell won't keep you warm! I got one mail order for $19.95, and I cancelled my AAA membership when I got their catalog offering me the same piece of crap for the &quot;member&quot; price of $35.00!! Jeff
