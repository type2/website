Subject: [T2] pulley

Hey there guys and gals,
A friend of mine is in need of a 38 amp generator pulley.  This would be
the longer generator.  He needs the pulley that fits it....so that the
pulleys will line up...and the belt will fit nice.  Anyone out there
have one?  Please say yes.....
Are they available from anywhere??
