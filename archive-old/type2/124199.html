Subject: Re: [T2] I just stripped the interior of my 73 Westy...

Don asked:


This looks like it would be ideal:

 Any idea what year it's from?

--------------------------------------------------------------------

The unit came from a 74-75 USA deluxe Westy. BUT not that fridge. That is an add-in.
74/75 deluxes have two standing units, one behind each front seat. The one behind the driver
was the sink with water tank, the spacesaver spare was under it. The one behind the pass seat was the stove
with a fridge below it.

Here is parts of the 74 Westy owners manual:

Page 3 tells about basic equipment: http://www.geocities_dot_com/thegreatjose/VW/74westypage03.JPG

Page 4 tells about the deluxe equipment: [section 2]
http://www.geocities_dot_com/thegreatjose/VW/74westypage04.JPG

Page 11 shows the deluxe sink behind the driver:

Page 12 shows the stove/fridge behind the pass:
http://www.geocities_dot_com/thegreatjose/VW/74westypage12.JPG

The door on the fridge is wood, to match all the other dark wood. If you look at the fine print
below 'gas stove', it says 'only valid with type P 27'.
P 21 was the non-poptop Westy, P 22 was the basic poptop Westy, P 27 was the deluxe Westy.
