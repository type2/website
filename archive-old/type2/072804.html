Subject: Ignition switch

Help!

'79 bus.  I'm trying to replace my ignition switch, and I cannot figure out
how to get the top plastic trim piece off of the ignition column.  I have
the turn signal switch and windshield wiper switch out, but short of
breaking it to pieces, I cannot figure out how to get the plastic piece off
to expose the ignition switch.  I have it loose all the way around the
steering column, but it is hung up right around the ignition switch itself.

I'm in digest mode, so if someone could pmail me ASAP, it would be much
appreciated.

Thanks in advance
