&gt; &gt; I can't find a mike at the moment :-( but will mike it for thread

&gt; &gt; than 1.25 and the socket size is 19, not 17mm.

&gt; You don't need a mike...... your wheel lug nuts are 14mm x 1.5 and
&gt; your spark plugs are 14mm x 1.25.....

Bingo!  Final clue-by-four received!  The threads are M14x1.5
