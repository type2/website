Subject: Re: [T2] burned...

If they are dumb enough to ask a complete stranger for
drugs in a public parking lot, then you would be doing
them a favor! How so you ask? Maybe next time they
won't be so stupid as to ask an undercover cop or narc
agent if they have any dope.
I have plenty of patience and absolutely no dis-like
or problems with people who smoke pot, however I have
ZERO patience and much disgust for people who are
complete idiots about it!!
Peace, John Baker
