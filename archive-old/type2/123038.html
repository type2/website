&gt; This adds up to a much larger load on the engine, which will generate more
&gt; heat.  Consequently, if the engine is breathing 95-degree summer heat, it
&gt; cannot cool itself as effectively and will shorten your engine's life.

&gt; larger.  The bigger displacement will make more power which will allow you
&gt; to run a higher top speed.  As always, your mileage may vary (YMMV).

The bigger displacement [can] will make more power, which generates more
heat.  Also, the additional power won't help the top speed, thought it
might help you reach the top speed faster.  (top speed in a 68 and 69 is
governed more by the gear ratios.  4000rpm in 4th is 68.57 mph with stock
size tires.)

I haven't read the original post, but only this reply.  If you're looking
to gain a higher top speed, you need to look at many factors including,
but not limited to:

Brakes
Engine/oil cooling
Engine power output
Gearing
