Subject: [T2] rust through

Dear List, 

As I was replacing my shocks (soggy) my wheel cylinders (soggy) and my brake
shoes ( soggy, too) I noticed there's quite a lot of brittle, rusted metal,
hanging together as the unit formerly known as my frame.  The jack points
all collapsed with the Bilstein in them (tearing, crumbling sound).  After I
used a scissors jack and put it up securely on stands, I looked closely and
saw bubbly, cancer looking ick through out the front floor, up behind the
wheels in front and into the middle cargo area floor.  I already knew i had
cancer of the doors and bought new skins for them (to be professionally
installed...I don't know from auto body work).  Questions :  Can the
body/frame parts be bought and installed (not by me) with a safe ride
resulting? ( It will almost certainly be safer than it is now) and Is there
some action to take to prevent this from occurring again 15 years from now?
I live in Seattle, without a garage. I am the 2nd owner of this '68. I
didn't drive it for several years and this year have replaced/rebuilt most
every engine related part.  Thanks for your time and interest.  I've made an
appointment with Buffalo Restoration in Puyall, do any Puget Sound list
members know their reputation.
Thanks,
Jody
p.s.  Brakes, cylinders and shocks all working well...stopping is now crisp
and controlled :)
