Subject: Re: [T2] single vs. dual port

I just rebuilt my '70 engine, which had single port heads on it.  I too, 
wondered if I should convert to dual port, and my machinist &amp; mechanic, whom 
I trust very much (over 30 yrs of VW exp.), said what you have heard -- 
single ports tend to be more reliable, and sometimes the dual port heads 
have a tendency to crack bet/ the plug holes.  As for horses -- I wondered 
the same (I too carry a lot of gear) my machinist said that a new carb &amp; 
pistons and cylinders would give me what I needed (mine were ancient), and 
that buying new heads and manifold would not be worth the cost for the few 
extra horses.  I stayed with the single port.  My engine goes in today, so 
we'll see.

&gt;
&gt;I'm getting a rebuilt engine for my '71. It's currently single port-I know
&gt;dual was stock for that year. I need a new manifold to activate the brake
&gt;assist, so the only additional cost is the new carb. So, what to choose? My
&gt;goal is long lived reliability period. I've heard arguments that the single
&gt;port is a more reliable, less temperamental motor. But, let's be honest, I
&gt;carry a lot of gear in mine regularly, and it's a Flintstone mobile up
&gt;hills- a few extra horses might help! p.s. is the brake assist really
&gt;helpful?
