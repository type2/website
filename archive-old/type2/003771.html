Sounds like your steering box might be binding up somehow?

Subject: [T2] Steering Problem


&gt; I had a bit of excitement on the way to work today. As I was going around
a
&gt; corner the steering locked into place as I was straighten out. So I push
in
&gt; the clutch and roll to the side. Trying to free the steering wheel while
&gt; sitting in the drivers seat didn't work, so, I get out and in a adrenaline
&gt; charged yank while standing outside the bus I freed it up. I managed to
get
&gt; to work and back home with no more problems. But, there is a small clunk
ant
&gt; the base of the steering column now. Any ideas?
