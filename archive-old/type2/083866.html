Subject: Rotary Fan Switch

Where can I find a rotary fan switch that looks factory. I'd like a 4
position switch (off,high,med,low). Rocky Mountain Motorworks carries the
knob, but not the switch.

The switch that I'm trying to copy can be seen at
http://www.type2_dot_com/rvanness/accessor.htm - Scroll about halfway down.
Someone told me that I could probably order it if I had the part number, but
the picture is to blurry to read.
