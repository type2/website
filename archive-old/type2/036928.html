Subject: Ezee Brake bleeder kit from IPD

Just thought I would follow up with a report of actual use of this product
on my VW Bus.

I have a 1982 Aircooled Vanagon. The kit contains all parts needed to bleed
the brakes except a bottle of fresh brake fluid,a  a drain hose / jar to
collect the old brake fluid as you drain it out. TO use it is simplicity
itself. Just deflate your front driver's side tire to 20 PSI and fill the
bottle with brake fluid. screw the cap on tightly. one hose goes to the
brake fluid reservoir on the bus. the other hose fits onto the tire
inflation valve. I found that, in order for everything to work, you have to
ensure the tire stem is at 12 O'clock or there won't be enough hose to
reach. After pressurizing the system, you just duck under the vehicle and
drain brake fluid out at each of the brake cylinders. 

When finished, you first depressurize the system (unhook the air pressure
hose from the tire) then remove the cap on the brake fluid reservoir and
replace the stock reservoir cap. I noticed that this system does leave the
reservoir slightly overfilled after use. 

All-in-all, I can say that using this system DOES make for the most
hassle-free brake bleeding job I have ever done. It is well worth the cost.
Using this system means that I don't have to hassle with trying to
repeatedly refill the brake fluid reservoir and risk spilling brake fluid
all down into the instrument cluster. It means that I also don't have to
hassle with pumping the brake pedal; it makes an hour-long, messy, job into
a neat 15 minute (or less) job.

&gt; &gt; E-Z BLEED Power Brake Bleeding Tool, uses a low pressure air source,
such
&gt; &gt; as
&gt; &gt; from a spare tire (I usually just hook it up to the tire closest to the
&gt; &gt; Master Cylinder as it doesn't use much air) and it will pressurize the
&gt; &gt; entire brake system. All you have to do is crack open the bleeder
screws
&gt; &gt; one
&gt; &gt; at a time and the fluid comes out nice and quick. Comes with 6 popular
&gt; &gt; master cylinder adapter caps and fits most vehicles. If you like I can
have
&gt; &gt; our publishing dept send you an image of the bleeder for reference. Let
me
&gt; &gt; know.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The part # is WS4062 $28.50 ea.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks for your inquiry,
