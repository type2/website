Subject: Gene Berg Shifter

I just put a Gene Berg shifter on my 71 bus.  I didn't need it but was tired 
of the simian position I had to assume when driving in town with frequent 
shifts.  I am amazed at the difference.  It took me a few tries to get the 
shifter adjusted to pick up first and second gears but now it is smooth as 
whipped cream and the short throw is really great.  I don't work for Berg in 
their business or for their PR, by the way.  Wish the shifter had been 
cheaper, especially for a frivilous accessory, but I really like it and would 
put out the money again in a minute now I know what it is like to drive with 
it.
