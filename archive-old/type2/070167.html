Subject: Re: Oil Question

I don't know about flickering oil lights?! There might be another problem 
there,but in a new motor it's recommended to run 30 SAE non detergent 
for at at least 500 miles.There are pros and cons on synthetic oils and 
I'm the first to admit I don't have an answer.The most important thing in 
breaking in a new motor is that the rings find a home!Short trips,2 or 3 
oil changes in the first 1000 miles,VALVE adjustment 2 or 3 times in the 
same period,&amp; just being gentle with the motor,are all 
important!Viscosity is ofcourse a factor and if you use a non detergent 
oil,change it soon!
I have a friend and partner in crime who has been building these motors 
for a long time....He recommends starting the motor (with 30 SAE non 
detergent)running it up (various RPM's)for 20 or 30 min. Then draining 
the oil and starting all over again.
I'm not sure if I'm as radical but the point is:the more you change the oil
during break-in the better.As far as synthetics go I don't know,but in 
the beginning I wouldn't recommend it. -Mike

&gt; I am building a new 1641cc for my Kewl retro-Kustom Kombi project and 
&gt; have been thinking of running Castrol Syntec or some other synthetic oil.
&gt; 
&gt; Any comments?
