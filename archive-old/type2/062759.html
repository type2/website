Subject: Looking for an early bay window westphalia

Hello All.. I have been trying to restore a 71 camper, but have finally 
reached the breaking point.  Too much cancer.. It would cost about two 
grand to fix all of the rust, and I could find a rust free camper for 
that..

So, with that in mind, if any of you could help me find a 68-71 bus, or 
camper, that would be swell.. The interior doesn't matter, since I have 
the innards of one westphalia already, though it would be nice...  The 
exterior, however, should be real, real clean, with hardly any! rust or 
corrosion.

If you can help me find anything like that, I would be much obliged, and 
also, driving.  I live in New York, but will travel in the Northeast for 
a good specimen.
