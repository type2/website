Subject: Re:  [T2] oil light flickers on

&gt; Logic sequence: If the oil light flickers on/off or, worse, comes on and
&gt; stays on while the engine is running at all, then you are (obviously) 
&gt; losing (or not creating) oil pressure somewhere.

Or, as is very likely, your sensor is having a problem.  The sensor 
itself can fail to read properly or there may be a short in the wiring.  
In my Bus, the wiring had frayed at one of the connectors and would 
short against the engine as I drove over bumps.

If there is indeed a pressure problem, it may also be coming from a 
stuck pressure relief valve.
