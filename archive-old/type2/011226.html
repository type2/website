Subject: Colorado listees - CO bus club
Date: Fri, 21 Jul 2000 12:57:45 US/Mountain

Hey all you Colorado listees!  Did you know there's a bus club in CO?  I just 
found out about it a few weeks ago - called The Colorado VW Bus Club (OK, it's 
not real imaginative, but it s descriptive).  Dues are a whopping $15/year.  
It's a fairly new club, but already has over 70 members.  Their main focus 
right now seems to be camping trips (which suits me just fine), but there is 
talk of shows, charitable stuff, and whatever else anyone can think up and put 
together.  If you want signup info, contact me at mikeg_at_pcisys_dot_com and I'll 
send you what I know.
