&gt;I disagree. Stick with the 009 its a superior distributor. You don't want to

&gt;They're ancient.

And the 009 is &quot;space-age&quot; technology?  This cracks me up!  You realize 
that the 009 was first used on the 1959 &amp; earlier 36hp buses don't you?

Carb &amp; distributor technologies should be matched together - they were 
designed to work together as a unit.  The 34 PICT 3 carb was designed to 
use a vacuum advance distributor and will give a smooth throttle response 
throughout the rpm range when they are used together.

&gt;When using an 009 with a 34.3 there will be a dead stop upon 
&gt;shift up through the gears. 
&gt;Learn how to drive it best to eliminate that - overlap the clutch with the 
&gt;gas pedal a bit more and it will go smoother. 

This arguement is ridiculous at best...
