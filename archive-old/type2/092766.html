Subject: Re: [T2] troubling signs, and other questions (long)

They make a tool that uses a whack on the head to twist a screwdriver tip.

This will translate a very firm seating of the screwdriver to to a very 
sudden twisting force at the very same time.

I have had alot of success with this tool. Harbor Freight and Northern 
Tools and many, many others have this tool. Many FLAPS and Sears should 
have it too.

The other recommendation would be to get a very large Phillips screwdriver 
as many of the smaller varieties I have used have a tip that is too pointed 
and the rest of it isn't big enough in diameter. This is my typical tool 
and it works 99% of the time.

The foil is common to find when the oil changes are done by folks in a big 
rush - sloppy.

The fuel injector is not related to your low compression.

Did you squirt a bit of oil in the questionable cylinder and redo your 
compression test?

You narrow done the problem this way. I have also heard of injecting air in 
to the cylinder from an air compressor and listening for leaks. It can tell 
you what is leaking - intake or exhaust or both.

Take off the oil cap to listen for piston and ring leaks.


&gt;This weekend I began my quest to remove the heads from
&gt;my 78 2.0 FI engine.  I believe the problem is a
&gt;burnt exhaust valve, 3 cylinders have compression of
&gt;120-130, 1 has 30.  I'm pretty sure this engine is
&gt;all original, never having been rebuilt.
&gt;
&gt;In my haste to remove my engine, I forgot to drain the oil,
&gt;so the first thing I did was block the engine up high-enough
&gt;to get my oil container underneath.  Apparently a PO replaced my
&gt;oil drain plug with one that requires an allen wrench.  After
&gt;finding the right allen wrench I attempted to extract the plug
&gt;to no avail.  I applied a fair ammount torque and the thing didn't budge.
&gt;Rather than risking breaking something, I decided to drain the oil via the
&gt;oil strainer.
&gt;
&gt;There was a lot of sludge caked in the oil strainer cap, including
&gt;what looked like aluminum foil (*gulp*).  There were some fairly
&gt;large pieces and after arranging them I deduced that what I had was
&gt;remnants of an oil container seal, you could even still make out the
&gt;round impression of the rim of the oil container.  Also found was a
&gt;piece of blackened paper about the size of a quarter, I'm figuring
&gt;this is part of a gasket or the like.
&gt;
&gt;Besides the above, I found a small ammount of what seemed to be brittle 
&gt;flakes of metal, blackened from their time in the engine case.  A magnet 
&gt;did not attract
&gt;said pieces, so I figure they are either pieces of my case of maybe some
&gt;burned pieces of afore mentioned tin foil.  Any guesses?
&gt;
&gt;After cleaning &amp; replacing the oil screen, I started to remove the intake
&gt;and sheetmetal from the engine.  I noticed that the injector on the cylinder
&gt;with the pressumed bad valve had the tip busted/burnt off.  Could this be
&gt;a cause or an effect of my valve problem?
&gt;
&gt;Also, trying to remove the screws that secure the sheetmetal to the
&gt;head has been a royal PITA.  Now I'm left with 2 phillips-head
&gt;screws that have the innards stripped out.  I have a set of
&gt;easy-outs that, after last weeks thread, have decided to leave alone. I'm
&gt;a little nervous about drilling into the head. My latest thought about
&gt;this is that I could cut a groove in the screw heads with a dremel and
&gt;use a flat screwdriver to remove them.
