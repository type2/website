&gt;I would argue that a change to a type one is ok for saving money!
&gt;A lot more bugs have been on the road, and the parts are cheap. 

That's true, but the type IV does have a few advantages.

&gt;By the way, one of the busses is a 74 with european conversion. Why
&gt;did he do it? Cheap, cheap, cheap. New heads, new case, whatever, it is
&gt;much cheaper than a type IV.

You will most likely never have to replace a type IV case since it's made
of aluminum and not stress-fatigue prone magnesium.  The type I case does
burn better in the campfire though.  :-)

&gt;Once they are out you just can't stop! By the way, to tie this to the 
&gt;above
&gt;message, removal took all of about 15 minutes, 

Just for the sake of comparison, I can drop the engine and tranny in my
type IV bus in 45 minutes.  Yes, it's slower than with the type I, but it's
still pretty fast, and then it's very simple to work on.

&gt;a seal kit is about $10

You got me there.  I think type IV kits are around $80.

&gt;new pushrod tubes about $12. 

But what awful pushrod tubes!  Mine are non-collapsing and will last the
life of the engine if taken care of.

I don't really think one is superior over the other, but they are different
enough that individuals such as ourselves will have preferences for one or
the other.  Nothing wrong with that.  I prefer the type IV.  :-)
