Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel filter for gas heater?

&gt;I'm getting ready to install a gas heater in my Bus.  Should I install
&gt;a fuel filter on the gas line feeding the gas heater or does it not
&gt;matter?    Also was wondering if someone has a better copy of the
&gt;Stewart-Warner manual then what is in the Library.  The scanned
&gt;pictures just do not print out that well.
&gt;Kevin

Kevin, to answer your question about the filter, YES you need to put one on
the feed line to the heater, small paricals will plug up the fuel jet.

Here is some more information about gasoline heaters:

If you need South Wind service parts, go to:
http://pages.prodigy_dot_net/busbarn/southwind.html

Now if you are hesitant about working on your own heater, or are curious
about how it works, the seminar video and manuals can be a great help.
This is one satisfied customer's testimonial:

&quot;As I stated before, had it not been for your video and making the manual
and parts available, the heater would still be on the garage floor.  I was
going to post the success on the T-2 list, but then the price of used
heaters will shoot up at shows.  I want to get a few more before folks find
out about how reliable and useful they really are.&quot;

If you would like a video or manual, the information below will help you.
