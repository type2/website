Subject: Rear Brake Shoes - '73 Bus

All,

I've recently acquired a '73 bus and I'm in the process of replacing all the
brake components so I can do that stoppin' thang.  Had the brake booster
rebuilt by Ron at H&amp;R Boosters in Dallas (excellent resource!), replaced the
master cylinder, rebuilt the front calipers and rear cylinders, etc....

Here's my issue - I'm having trouble trying to get the &quot;correct&quot; brake shoes
for the rear.  My bus was built in October 1972 which I think means it would
have the early style shoes (the ones with the large studs riveted to the
shoes - they also use the horseshoe clips).  The crappy ones I'm replacing
are of this style.  

I've gotten 3 sets of shoes already and I haven't be able to get the
&quot;correct&quot; ones.  When I ordered the first set I did not realize that there
were early and late styles.  The second set was ordered after I obtained the
chassis info, but my FLAPS ordered the wrong part number.  They corrected
the error and the ones they claim are &quot;correct&quot; given the date of
manufacture don't have the large stud.  The guy at the counter told my dad
to &quot;take them off the old ones&quot;.  Is this correct?

So, in summary, given that my Bus was manufactured in October 1972, what
brake shoe style should I have? Also, I know that there is an issue about
the width or thickness of the braking material across the 72, 73 and 74
model years - Can anyone shed some light on this?

Once I get this mystery solved I can move on to making the Progressive Weber
the PO put on (and had rejetted 3 or 4 times) work correctly!

Thanks for your time,

Scott Misage
