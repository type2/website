Subject: Exhaust Gas Analyser?/Flunked emission

The Green Bean flunked a emmissions test today.  CO% 6.82 idle and 4.48 at
2573 rpm.  We were able to adjust the idle mixture to bring it down to 2.2
but couldn't get 2500 rpm  mixture below 4.0.  Compression good _at_ 125-135.
Just set valves last night.  Timing right on the mark.
  I checked the cold start circuit and  sensors 1 &amp; 2.  Sensor 2 (cylinder
head) seemed alittle low (resistance) so i replaced it with a spare, but
that reading would make a leaner mixture not a rich one I am experiencing.
I'm going to check the injector next but I question whether that could be
causing it.  Exhaust has no white smoke.  Any ideas?

I don't like shooting in the dark like this.  I don't want to keep having
to take it to the test station to see if I am making any progress.    I've
seen on the web and or the list some mention of how to fabricate your own
CO analyser using a o2 sensor and a volt meter, but the material I have
from Jan's Vw site is vague and doesn't give what the reading should be.
Anyone out there have any experience with this?

Thanks
