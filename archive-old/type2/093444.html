--=====================_2587550==.ALT


The speedometer and fuel gauge illumination in my '70 buses was terrible.

I replaced the two bulbs (one bulb per item) with Wagner P/N 17037.
Wagner is a 3rd party electrical supplier to automotive supply houses for 
flashers, lights, etc.

This is still a 12VDC-1.2 watt bulb, as was the original VW factory 
installation,
but the illumination is much better.

Has anybody used another bulb of even brighter output through a wattage 
increase or a more efficient lumens output?

If so, what bulb(s) did you use.
Where did you get your cross reference list to assist your selection?

At any rate........ if knowing nothing else,
keep Wagner P/N 17037 handy 'cuz it made my dash light up one heck of a lot 
better than the original bulbs of 30 year vintage.
