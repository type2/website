I just got a new bolt, nut &amp; washers &amp; installed the bolt from the back
side.  Real pain but it was the best way.  The original bolt was welded in
place but mine had broken.  It was hard getting a wrench on the bolt head
but it is possible. I dropped that sucker, I do not know how many times.  It
will work.  That was on my 76 Westy.

&gt; Does anyone have a recommendation for dealing with a broken upper shock
&gt; mounting bolt? I heard a knocking from the back end the other day and when
I
&gt; investigated it appeared that the shock bolt had come loose. But no amount
&gt; of turning it will tighten it up, so the thing has either stripped out or
&gt; broken. Will a Helicoil hold it? Drill and tap?
