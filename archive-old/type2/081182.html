Subject: Re: [T2] engine stands

I don't think the bench mounted ones would even come close for a type 4
engine, it seems barely adequate for a short block type 1. I finally did
what a few others have done which is to use the bell housing off a tranny
and mount it to a 1 ton V8 engine stand. That gives me 3 stands as I also
have the bench mount stand as well as a VW dealership stand.

For working alone or when friends vanish, the best money I ever spent was
for a hydraulic lift table. For me it goes like this. Pull engine on trolly
jack, slide engine over onto lift table, roll table over to floor mounted
engine stand and lift engine into place. My back is so much happier.

Subject: [T2] engine stands


All this talk of jack stands brought to mind something
I've been pondering on and off for awhile.  Where's
the best deal on engine stands?

I've seen the bench mounted variety on the various
VW vendor sites, but I don't feel real comfortable
placing my 2.0 liter engine on one of those, even
if the stand holds up, I'm no carpenter and I don't
want to be reminded of that by finding my engine
smashed all over the floor in my shop.  Also, how
many people does it take to help get the engine
on-and-off the stand?  I'm lucky to scrounge 1 person
these days, my friends back out of the driveway and leave
if they see the bus backed into the shop.

It just seems to me that the roll-away stand would make things
a bit easier.
