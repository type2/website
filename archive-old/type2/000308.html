Has anyone heard of a brand of tires named &quot;WooSung&quot; and made in Korea. I
stopped by an independent truck tire dealer and asked if he had any 195R14,
load range D tires. He said that they had just imported a container of tires
and had 185 and 195 R 14 in a load range D, Max load 1875_at_65psi cold.
Salesman said that they were a great tire and the price ($60.00 each
everything included) was because they had imported a whole container and
thus had quantity pricing. (what else would he say) Anyone ever had any
experience with this make and are there any other questions I should ask? As
always, the wisdom of the list is invaluable.TIA TBear
