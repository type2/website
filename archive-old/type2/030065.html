Ooh!!  good thought!  This is quite possible.  I should thought of it.

Check the front brakes, too in the case of a '69, since they would be
drums. If it does turn out to be that they are way out of adjustment, do
pop the drums off and look for leaks in the cylinders under the dust caps.  
Letting the shoes get that far out allows the cylinders to travel more
than normal and running over that new surface (with its old rust) can
munge the seals on the wheel cylinders.
