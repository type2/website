Hi all
Have not seen this prob on the list yet so hope some one might have run across
it.I am slowly bringing a ' 70 Westy back to life after the po left her to rot
and after getting her running I notice that there are 3 , 14''  wheels and 1
15'' wheel. Makes for an interesting ride. I know 14 is stock but has any one
had any experiance with converting to 15'' wheels. Local shop says is good
idea ( 15x6 wheels are dirt cheap and add a little more clearance) but would
like an objective opinion.
Chuck
