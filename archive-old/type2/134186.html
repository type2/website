Subject: Re:Need help with possible engine purchase

I don't know what you're trying to accomplish with the Porsche engine.
I've run the Type IV Vanagon engines for ten years and they produce more HP
at the required 3000 / 3300 RPMS than a Porsche 914 2000cc or the 912e
2000cc Type IV.
Lugging a Porsche at 3000 running 70 mph is just going to overheat it.
My 912e runs 3300 at 75+ MPH only pushing 2300 pounds. 
I seem to think with the 5 speed it's closer to 85 mph.
If you try pushing 3700 to 5200 pounds you're in for bad overheating of the
oil and heads.

(96mm with SCAT crank, high lift cam)
