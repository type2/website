The &quot;grub screw&quot; should have a hole through it for a wire.  Run the wire
around the whole unit (through the screw) and it won't back out anymore.

&gt; 
&gt; I was under the impression that that collar was meant to be loose (?),
&gt; that 
&gt; in fact a loose grub screw was what usually made the system slip. I have
&gt; the 
&gt; same problem from time to time as the end of the screw in mine doesn't fit
&gt; 
&gt; the indentation in the hockey stick shaft well and wears down rapidly with
&gt; 
&gt; use, and so I fix it by tightening the screw every so often. I'm thinking
&gt; of 
&gt; drilling right through the linkage and hockey stick shaft and putting in a
&gt; 
&gt; tractor-style push pin for a permanent fix. Anyone ever done this?
