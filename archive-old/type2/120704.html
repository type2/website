Subject: Re: PC in Bus

Boy, this thread sure morphed into sompething
completely different in the past few days... My
Internet access has been intermittent at best for the
past couple of days, so please forgive me if I'm
repeating anything.  I think the intent of the
original question was how to get in-and-out of a setup
for transferring pics from a digital camera for the
lowest possible cost and/or degree of complication,
not how to have a MP3 library/DVD player/GPS
navigation/133t h_at_xxor box/etc. etc. etc.  In my
opinion, a good used laptop and inexpensive inverter
is still the best bet in this situation.

That being said, I am planning some type of multimedia
system for my bus... I have a 7&quot; 12V LCD with two
inputs and rearview camera that I was going to use on
another car, but now I think I might put it in the bus
with a DVD player and the spare CD player I have
laying around - although there are some really trick
flip-out in dash LCD monitors on eBay for under
$200...  I still haven't decided whether or not I want
to deal with an FM modulator so I can get sound
through the busses' speakers - anyone else try this? 
My other thought was to go with a mini ITX system -
most of them have a composite video out, don't they? 
Hmmm, I do have my MP3 library on a USB hard drive...
