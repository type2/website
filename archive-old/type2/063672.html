Subject: Another Discovery (/f, but true, and long)

Back in the Sixties, Bert Roan bought his blue 1959 Kombi for deer
hunting.  It still  helps him fill the freezer today, though things have
changed a bit...but I am  getting a little ahead of the story.

I’d first seen the Kombi while bicycling along a wooded country road. 
It was almost an archetypal find, sitting among some scrub and vines,
behind a metal-clad pole barn and a faded pink and white trailer. Out in
front, a stocky man with dark gray hair was tending a small, smoky fire
built inside an old truck rim. 

I left my bike  by the road, walked back, and introduced myself.  I
offered pleasantries, and I told him I had an old VW bus and had noticed
his.

Summarily, he looked up.  “It’s not for sale.”

“Oh, I’m out here on vacation, nowhere near home. Got one kind of like
it;  I just wanted to take a look.”

He poked at the fire a bit. “People don’t stop here often, but the only
reason they do is 'cause of that bus. Years ago, a hippie parked his old
VW bus on the road, and walked up the drive with a bag o’ tools on his
shoulder.  Told me he needed the generator.  Didn’t ask, didn’t offer to
pay, just said he needed it to get back home. I told him to go to hell. 

“Last year someone just helped themselves.  Messed up the dashboard,
took that VW thing off the front.  Really made me mad,  since when I
drove it back and parked it there, everything was there and everything
worked.”

“So it was running when you parked it. When was that?” I asked.

“Well, I bought it for deer hunting, that ground clearance and traction
were great on the sandy two-track roads around here.  But then the
government started buying up all the hunting lands for the park.  Closed
all the trails, so I changed my plans.  Musta been around ‘75 when I
stopped driving it.

“Lately, my wife’s health has been poor; we only get up here weekends
now, and not every one at that. We bought this place in 1950, still try
to get here when we can.  Since folks have been messing with that bus, 
I like to walk back and check on it each time I visit.” Straightening
out of his crouch, he said, “Let’s go have a look.”

We walked around the back of the barn. My first good look was from the
rear, and I saw round taillights and a rectangular rear window.  Not
ancient, but a respectable age. The body was a lovely medium blue,  but
worried with lots of surface rust, especially on the roof.  A long time
ago, someone had  made a quick job of repairing the rockers with
galvanized sheet metal. “With all the problems, why don’t you  take
those taillights off  and stop tempting people?”  I asked. 

Bert wanted to change the subject.  He pointed up the hill to the right.
“There are two deer runs there, one coming down each side, then they
join up and pass us over there, twenty feet from the cargo door.  On the
other side, deer come into the pasture from the south, walk along the
edge, and then move across in front of the bus. So there are three
natural deer runs on my property, and that’s why I parked it here.  It’s
right at the crossroads! Of course, they’ve been walking past the bus
all year,  and it’s only in late November when I’m sitting out here....”
he chuckled.

He focused on the Kombi again, and  opened up the engine lid.  It looked
like the proper 36 horsepower engine -- # 2646017 -- with the cast-in
generator stand and the funky squashed fuel pump.  A six-volt battery to
the right, daylight visible below it, held in only by the battery
cables. To the left was an Eschbacher gasoline heater. 

He whispered conspiratorially, “That heater is what makes the whole
thing work.  I charge up a battery, put some fuel in the tank each fall,
and I have my own heated deer blind.”

“It still runs?” I asked, trying not to sound overly amazed. 

“Yeah, sure. The heater, anyway.  I bring out a big pot of goulash, too,
put it under the rear seat by the heat outlet, and that damn heater
warms me up, inside and out!”

At this point, he lifted the rear hatch. A mass of insulation, seeds, 
mouse dung,  and other assorted detritus fell out.  There was a strong
aroma of musk and urine. “The rest of the 
year the raccoons call it home,” guessed Bert. “I don’t mind it much: in
hunting season the cold keeps the smell down.”  I looked beyond the
accumulation. The radio cover plate looked pristine, and the dome light
lens was intact and perfect. So much for the good parts.  

Bert moved around to the passenger side, and showed me how he had
carefully oiled the hinges. The cargo doors opened beautifully.  Inside,
a three-passenger middle seat faced the rear seat, and a small makeshift
table sat between the two. The original VW Carat model.  It was not as
elegant, though, and the seat color was strange, a light yellow green.
He saw me looking very carefully at the brown piping. “Those aren’t the
originals.  The seats that came with it were shot and I got these off a
guy who was making his bus into a dune buggy or some such thing.” 

“Those middle seats are hard to find”,  I said. “Everybody took them out
and threw them away.  A three-passenger seat is  what I need for my
project....”.  He didn’t rise to the bait. 

Next, we moved up to the front and he opened the passenger door.  I
reached in and lifted up the seat back.  “Still has the spare,” said
Bert. But I was looking for the build plate, and I found it:

13 11 8
372 13 175
UF 231 BLUE 409913

In college, I had wanted to decipher Mayan hieroglyphs.  I would imagine
myself at an archeological site in the Yucatan, walking up to a fallen
stele, just unearthed from the humus of the jungle floor.  The carving,
not having seen the light of day for twelve centuries, would be
surrounded by a cluster of scholars and Mayan workers, anxious to here
the words of the ancients.  I would consider the inscription,  decode
the words and numbers and finally make a pronouncement.  Something
like:  “On June 8, 756, the Butterfly Lord ascended the throne,
celebrating the passing of his mother, the Lady Ix Chel.” 

Instead, I found myself with yet another splittie moldering away in the
woods, and I deciphered for Bert Roan:

“Built November 13, 1958”.

“That guy who sold it to me ripped me off - he said it was a ‘59!”

“Well, November would put it in the 1959 model year.  372 - that’s  a
bit of an unknown, probably US export equipment; 13 - middle and rear
seat, and 175 refers to the bumper overriders. UF:  we know the U is a
USA designation, but the scholars are still working on whatever letter
follows the U.  231 - that means it’s a Kombi model, left hand drive,
right hand cargo doors.  BLUE is the color of course, Dove Blue I think
it was called.

“Cripes,” said Bert. “I mean, it’s pretty obvious it’s blue, right, why
would they stamp it in a damn plate?”

I let that one go by.  “...and the last number is the vehicle serial
number.” I retreated from the front seat, noting that the steering wheel
- -- black, of course -- had no apparent cracks.

We moved around to the front.  It was clear that the VW emblem had been
removed in the not too distant past, the paint underneath still clean
and bright.  I took a picture of Bert and his bus. 

As we walked back to the trailer, Bert appeared pensive.  Reconsidering
the issue of the middle seat perhaps, but my hopes were quickly dashed.

“You know”, he smirked, “I could just smash those taillights. Then no
one would ever bother my bus again.”
