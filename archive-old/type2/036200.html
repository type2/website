&gt; need someone to tell me teh trick to the rear torsion bars.
&gt; do they pry off the splines a bit, drop down, and pry all the way
&gt; off?

Yes, although I would pry them out a little while the floor jack is
supporting the end of torsion arm.  When the torsion arm is past the stop,
slowly lower the jack to release the tension. This way it won't spring down
and possibly cause harm or damage.  The end of the torsion arm will lower
approximately 8  inches before all the tension is released.

&gt; do they become easy to come off with up-tension?

Once the tension is released, they are much easier to pry off.  The splines
on the torsion bar and the splines in the torsion arm seem to be machined to
very exact tolerances so it may take a little patience and a lot of finesse
to separate them.

&gt;
&gt; i'm not getting very far with pulling them up, and i keep
&gt; stepping back and thinking, &quot;that's just putting more
&gt; tension on them...&quot; what i need is less.
&gt; then i think, to hell with it. why even swap them out...
&gt; then i think, no... i have to get behind there.

By &quot;pulling them up&quot; do you mean while installing?  If so, I slide the
torsion arm on as far as I can then jack up the end of the torsion arm until
it is just past the lower stop.  I whack it into place with a large rubber
mallet then attempt to install the cover plate.  I found 4 longer bolts that
will fit the cover plate and I begin to evenly torque down the cover to pull
the torsion arm in the rest of the way.  After this is done, replace the
longer bolts with the stock bolts, one at a time.  Also, replace the rubber
donuts while you're in there, they are inexpensive enough.  I replaced mine
and it cured the annoying squeaking noise that I could never find.  The book
also mentions coating the rubber donuts with talcum powder before
installing.

&gt;
&gt; my main concern is... how much tension is in there?

Probably enough to do some damage if you let the torsion arm snap off the
lower stop.

Because of all the pulling, tugging, and pounding, I had two jack stands
supporting the bus and two tires with large chunks of 4x6 placed under
various areas of the bus.  I didn't want to get squished.
