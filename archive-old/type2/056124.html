Subject: '79: CV woes, Disc Brakes and Front Wheel Bearings

hello all:
just so ya know, this is the one owner 48000mile '79 westy
I bought last month. Well, now I am the second owner :)
The bus was only driven 3000miles since 1989.  For the
last 3 years it was only driven a few hundred miles.

I've been working on my new '79 getting ready to swap my 2.0L
from the '77 into it. Then I'm off to texas, i hope.....

Anywho- I stripped several of the CV bolts while removing
them.  I bought taps, screw extractors, drill bits, etc....
Wanna know how i finally got them out ?

I hammered my triple-square, 12-point into the bolt and was 
able to bust them loose.  Try it next time you have one strip
on you.

Now, I get to pulling the CVs off to clean and repack and
3 out the 4 are stuck on the shaft. Yes, I removed the circlip :)
If I had a vice I think I could tap/beat the center piece off....
However, I don't have a vice...

Any suggestions ???

I pulled the calipers and rotors off and they need some attention.
They are the original factory parts, calipers havent been rebuilt
and original owner couldn't remember if rotors/discs had been 
resfurfaced/turned.  

question:
Can a caliper always be rebuilt ?
or are some too far gone ?

I was hoping to buy caliper rebuild kits and have a local mechanic
rebuild them for me.  That a good idea, or I buy rebuilt or new
calipers ?

How long/many miles can you expect to get from front wheel bearings ?
These are the factory installed bearings in a '79 with 48000 miles.

I plan to pull them out and clean, but if 50000 is about the end of
the road for them, I would prefer to go ahead and replace them
while I have things torn apart.

I thought last summer when I was working on the '77 I would be enjoyin
my bus this summer. But nooooo, I had to go buy another one and spend
the summer working on it.  Am I crazy, will the rest of my summers be
spent crawling around under a bus.....

Thanks for all the help!
