Subject: [T2] Good parts stores in Vegas?

Hi all!

Can anybody suggest a few good parts shops in the Las Vegas area? Or maybe
even a good parts yard? The info is for a friend of mine who will be there
for a 3 day conference. He's got an older bus and bug.....

Also, I will be in Boston from the 29th for a week and am looking for a few
parts as well, primarily at this point a lower single belt pulley to a
Judson supercharger (bug project) but bus parts are always welcome. Any
suggestions are appreciated.

For those who may be in the area and interested, I have a couple of old
eberspachers (not complete systems), one from a bus and one from a T3 that I
could maybe be pursuaded to bring over. Let me know

TIA,

John B.
