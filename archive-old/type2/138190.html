Subject: Re: [T2] Too many questions?

This is interesting. I'm not the slightest bit stressed (or paranoid, 
for that matter). In fact, if I were any more relaxed, I would be 
comatose.

I don't see any relationship whatsoever between wanting the best engine 
I can possibly build and not enjoying it.

EMV (everyone's mileage varies)

&gt; much paranoia can infect the engine so that it will never be right, no
&gt; matter how carefully you build it.
