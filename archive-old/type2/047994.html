Subject: [T2] Jump Starts and Turn Signals

This two unrelated questions, but here goes.

First, this morining after my daughter's check up there was a lady whose car 
wouldn't start.  She asked me if I had any jumper cables.  Since my bus is FI, 
I was paranoid about jumpstarting anyone since I know all the warnings about 
frying &quot;the brain&quot;.  After I had her try to start it again, and there was no 
reaction in the engine at all, I told her I didn't think it was the battery 
since there was no sound like the engine trying to turn at all.  So, I took 
her and the kids to their house where she was going to call her husband.  The 
question is: Can my FI bus just not receive jumpstarts, or I am not to give 
them either?

Second question which arose as I was driving to lunch with a co-worker.  My 
turn signals don't turn off after completing a turn.  I had never given it any 
thought since I have always had to turn them off since I've owned the bus. My 
co-worker thought it was odd though.  Are they supposed to turn off on their 
own?

The bus is '76 Westy if that makes a difference to any of this.
