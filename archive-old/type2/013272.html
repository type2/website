&gt;Please Mr. or Ms. Parts Vendor:

&gt;1.  Don't lie to me.  If you're going to be dishonest, look out, I 
&gt;get mean when
&gt;     I'm mad.
&gt;
&gt;2.  Don't take me for granted.  You are not the only vendor out there.

Steve brings up many good points for vendors to consider.  Among the biggest ones for me are being lied to and not giving their employees the power to fix problems.  There have been multiple occasions where I placed an order for numerous items, and I always ask the order taker if everything I've asked for is in stock.  When I receive the shipment, sometimes a part or two will be backordered.  When I call to ask why I was told my back-ordered parts would be in the shipment but weren't,  I always get some lame line like &quot;somebody else must have grabbed it off the shelf after you placed your order&quot;.  I've come to the conclusion, right or wrong, that some companies won't tell you that some of the things you are ordering are out of stock, because they think you won't order from them unless they have everything you want.  This upsets me.  I'd rather be told that one of my ordered items are out of stock, but will be back in stock in a week or a month or a year, rather than be lied to just so I'll place an order.  I can accept that one of my items are back-ordered if told up front.  Needless to say, I don't order from these vendors any more.  

Since I've spent probably over $10K in the past year on bus stuff, and I believe in giving multiple vendors a chance, I've probably placed at least one order with most of the commonly known, and some uncommonly known, vendors on the bus scene.  If any of you would like to hear my experiences with SPECIFIC vendors, privately e-mail me, and I'll share my info with you.
