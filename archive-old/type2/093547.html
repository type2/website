&gt;My alternator stopped charging the battery about a week ago. If I check my

Sounds like it's not putting out any power.

&gt;So I pulled my alternator and voltage regulator and took them to AutoZone
&gt;to have them tested. The tested OK (although the alternator didn't test
&gt;right the first time - but the guy moved his ground connector and it
&gt;started putting out 14V+.

Since they did get it to put out some voltage, I would suspect the regulator.

&gt;I'm trying to avoid spending the $100+ for a rebuilt alternator at the
&gt;FLAPS (Beck-Arnley is $90 and Bosch is $130).

If you must buy an alternator, DO NOT waste your time with anything other than a Bosch.  Been there, done that, got to pull the alternator twice.  Just get the Bosch and skip eating out once or twice to make up the difference.

&gt;Anybody have any hints as to where to look next? 

Regulator.  Wells - I think the part is VR-980 but I don't have the box in front of me.  They are cheap, like $15 or so.  Buy one and try it.  If that wasn't the problem, now you have a spare.  If it was the problem, go buy another one for a spare and keep it in your bus (parts you carry in the bus with you never break).
