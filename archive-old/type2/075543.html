Subject: Re: [T2] Westy interior panel patterns

I would suggest that you just use your common sense and get any/all
measurements that look important.  I also have a 71 Westy, so I can use it
to back check patterns to see if they make sense.

This is great - it is something I've been meaning to do for a while, but had
no real need of my own that required me to do it.

I'm gonna try to do the sliding door panel this weekend.

Rob &amp; Russell,

I'd be happy to measure the wood headliner pieces from my 71 Westy.  I don't
have any AutoCad skills, but I'd be happy to mail you both poster sized
printouts of the files after they were done.
If you want me to measure the panels and there is any particular advice I
should know, please let me know what it is.
