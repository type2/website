Subject: side door -rear center latch won't disengage

The side door is latched closed and won't open.
When operating the lever, the front latch clicks,
but the rear latch doesn't.  The inside door panel
is off, and the cable and control rod don't seem
to operate anything inside the rear latch.
v
Can the rear center latch be operated by 
anything that I can reach with the door closed?
With the inside panel off, I can barely see the 
cam on the back of the rear latch, and I have the 
outside track cover off. 
v
background:  The restorer has had this door off 
for painting and to replace the seal.  I wasn't 
there when it was put back together.  The latch
mechanism had been removed to avoid masking, 
but not disassembled as far as I know. The 
latch mechanism *wasn't* tested for correct 
operation before the door was first latched.  After 
the door was stuck, the restorer (maybe 
&quot;destructor&quot; in this case) had kicked the inside 
handle (original) and broke it in half trying to 
force it open.  Now (and maybe *before*), the 
control rod that goes into the rear latch doesn't 
seem to operate anything.  I can't tell if  the 
attachment of that control rod inside the rear latch 
is broken now (if broken at all) from the attempts 
to force it, came loose before it was put back in, 
or if it is just stuck.  I have the Chilton's manual, 
but it doesn't have a picture of anything on the 
inside of the rear latch.  The &quot;restorer&quot; wants to 
keep beating and prying on it, and I'm a wreck 
now (if not *before*).
