hi all,
  I have a 72 westy that had an engine fire, now that all the electrical is
new and all hooked up, i have no power anywhere
. Im trying to follow Bentley, and i thought i did a good job, but obviously
i didnt. I Have no power going to the fuses, and i followed the wires back there
are no breaks.  Where i think the problem lies is that the battery + cable goes
to the selanoid(sp)and to a junction box of some sort on the ceiling
of engine compartment, then wires of that box go to the fuses, but out of that
box there is no power.In the Bentley I cant find the box...im confused any help
would be great, i need to drive my bus....thanks Chad
