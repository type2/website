Subject: Re: [T2] CR, deck height, blah blah

If you don't know how to calculate CR's here's a spreadsheet
that will do the calculations for you:

http://home.hiwaay_dot_net/~langford/corvair/cr_3100_ml.xls

Do it for each and every cylinder.

As far as determining deck height, I find that difficult in a TypeIV
engine (I'm guessing that's what you're talking about here) because
of the depression in the top of the piston.  Absent some sort of
special jig, I've found the best way for me (i.e., repeatable 
measurements) is to bolt the cylinder in place using spacers to
take up the slack between the stud threads and the top of the
cylinder.  (I cut and shaped some shims out of plastic tubing
that rests on the &quot;ridge&quot; next to the top fin, allowing me to bolt
us some pretty good torque without worrying about breaking off
a fine.)  Then use a good straight-edge and feeler gauges to measure
deck height.

If you're using regular VW heads - not AMC heads with the machined
in step - then you can try the method described by Stan Wilder 
whereby you bolt on the heads and then crush something like a piece
of solder between the top of the cylinder and the bottom of the head
and measure the crushed piece with a micrometer.  Can't use this
method with AMC heads because then you'd be measuring the sum
of deck height and the step height with no way to determine which
is which.

&gt; volks,
&gt; 
&gt; im waist deep in a rebuild and having trouble calculating my compression
&gt; ratio so I can add/remove shims. Is there a dummies guide to calculating
&gt; this stuff. There is a some stuff in the library, but nothing that tells
&gt; you how to find deck height...
&gt; thanks in advance
