&gt;Now that winter is near, and I am using the heater, I get an
&gt;exhaust smell in the bus.  I don't think that the heat exchangers are
&gt;leaking, but how would I check without pulling the exhaust system off?  I
&gt;have the stock blower fan in the engine compartment, and I installed an
&gt;Attwood bilge blower fan in line with the main heat tube.  Both fans work
&gt;fine.  The foam seal in the engine compartment is in good shape.  All the
&gt;heat system components are in place (all that I know of).

Are you sure it's exhaust and not burning oil?  I'd check to see if the
exchangers are coated with oil first.
