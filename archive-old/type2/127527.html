Subject: Whats the secret for removing push rod tubes??

I have been working on a 2.0 liter 78 westy that has
BIG oil leaks from the push rod tubes. I am replacing
the seals, a few of the push rod tubes practically
fell out when I removed the rocker arms, but another
few are being very difficult!!! So anyone have any
tips on removing stubborn push rod tubes from a 2 liter??
