Subject: Re: [T2] Leaking Oil Cooler on type 4 engine

Mike,

I have done it myself, twice a few months ago.

Just like you I had a heavy leak following reinstallation of a newly rebuilt
engine.

You can take the cooling housing off, and access the oil cooler.  I drive a
1973 with a 1800 cc just like yours.

I was surprised how relatively easy it was.

Disconnect the battery, take out the left center, and right rear tins. Take
out the fan, take out the Alternator, all the wires and pipes to housing.
Loosen the housing, there is enough room to back it out and slip it out from
the engine compartment, not much room, but enough.



Best of  luck, Andrea
