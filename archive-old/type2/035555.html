Subject: [VB] '73 Camper Free Sacramento Area

[...]

&gt;Please forward this on to the loaf list.
&gt;
&gt;Grass Valley actually, 30 miles east of Sacramento.
&gt;
&gt;Spotted this in the local paper, free section.
&gt;
&gt;'73 VW Camper Van, Needs engine.  530-639-0425
&gt;
&gt;That's all I know about this bus.
&gt;
&gt;I will loan the use of my bus tow bar for anyone
&gt;who wants this bus.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;For anyone even more adventurous, I know of a
&gt;'64 Ford Falcon window van for $10, needs an
&gt;engine, but this deal includes a '78 Granada
&gt;just for that purpose.  The Granada even runs.
&gt;The van is in really good condition, wish I
&gt;could get it, but no projects for now.
&gt;
&gt;Gotta act really fast on the Ford van, the owner
&gt;is moving and the landlord wants the van gone.
&gt;
&gt;Call me at 530-268-3748 for the Ford or towbar
&gt;after you strike a deal on the VW.
&gt;
&gt;Jeff  no bus anymore, but I got a tow bar!
