Bob,

Here's a good scenario----

Does a dentist do his own teeth?

Never happen.

Does a barber cut his own hair?

Not hardly.

I been painting and welding semi's for 25 years, and believe me, I've
had it up to here, with the refinishing, and rebuilding garbage.

Therefore, I neither drive my 55,000 miled BMW nor my 32,000 miled Bus
in the winter-----

Too nice to throw their fate to mayor Dailey, and his salt trucks. :&gt;)

So they stay parked in inclement conditions.

My Vanagon is perfect for this endeavor---

Later,

            ______________
