&gt; Hey folks,
&gt;
&gt; I just had an &quot;experience&quot; with another automotive interest list. I
&gt; won't say what kind of car, but it wasn't German and it wasn't air
&gt; cooled.
&gt;
&gt; It was such a contrast to this list that I feel the need to pat
&gt; everyone on this list on the back for being reasonably rational,
&gt; supportive, encouraging; for having a healthy respect for logic; and
&gt; most of all for having a sense of humor about our buses and for
&gt; generally being pretty good eggs.

Thanks for the comment.

Now bugger off!

(just kidding)

Yes, the bus list is the most helpful one I've come across.  Most lists
for more modern cars tend to be occupied by folks who don't know which end
of the soldering iron to hold and with no interest in learning.  All they
want to know is things like &quot;will these kewl wheels look good on my rice
rocket?&quot;
