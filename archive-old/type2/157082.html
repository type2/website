Subject: Re: [T2] Name of &quot;partial&quot; pop-top?

ron not sure but you might be talking about the penthouse tops or maybe the rivera tops???? they are the full length of bus except over the top of the driver/passenger seat...

top I have seen occasionally. I would like to know the official  
terminology for the style of top that is only around 1/3 as long as a  
full Westy top. To be fair, I think I've only seen these on pre-68  
buses, but would still like to know how to refer to them in my search.

I believe my current bus is in very good mechanical condition - don't  
want to go through what I did on it with another unit. Though, in the  
end, I might settle for another project with a Weekender version.

Thanks,
