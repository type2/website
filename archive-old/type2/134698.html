OK  Small update - if you can call it that..... Bought a new battery (Group
size 41). It cranks a heck of a lot faster, but still wont turn over all the way.
On to checking the starter I guess..

Huh?!?

'It cranks a heck of a lot faster, but still wont turn over all the way.

What are you meaning by this. It cranks faster but won't turn over all the way?

If it cranks around and around and around, then the engine is turning over. 
Do you mean 'It won't fire and run'?
If yes, then why would you want to check the starter??

You need fire, fuel, and compression to run an engine. If the engine cranks, look elsewhere. Not the starter.
