Subject: noisy elec.fuel pump


Today I just replaced my fuel pump on my 82 westy .Took out german model and 
put in some aftermarket brand. The new one is noisier than the one I took 
out, I guess noisy doesn't mean it's going bad. Or can I buy a quieter new 
one. All the rubber mounts are original and in good shape. Also the one on 
my 87 vanagon looks real similar but doesn't make any noise at all. Any body 
have any revalations on this subject, or similar expierience ?
