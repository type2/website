A few questions for those experienced in air cooled technology...

There seems to be a lot of play in the steering.  Is this normal?  What
might need to be looked at?

Does the accessory battery charge while driving or does it need to be
plugged into a/c to recharge?

What is the small silver receptacle under the glove box?

Is there a cigarette lighter receptacle?  Where?

please send answers to rr44run_at_aol_dot_com as she has not subscribed yet.
Thanks very much...
