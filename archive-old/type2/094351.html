Subject: Side marker by Hella

Folks,

I bought an expensive side marker housing recently and the vendor claims
it's a Hella part.  The picture on their website is marked Hella but what I
received doesn't have any markings at all.

How can I tell if this is a Hella item these days?

Rear Side Marker Housing W/Socket, Original Equipment Hella, 70-79 Bus
