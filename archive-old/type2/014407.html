Subject: Re: [T2] Doormobile, Rivera, HPBus

I'd be willing to build these pages and send them to the list
administrator so he can publish them.
With the list administrators approval or assistance to keep duplications
out, hey I can tell a bay from a split but that is about it.

Stan

 I would love to touch base with anyone still running an HPBus
 conversion.. I'm beginning to think I've got the only one left 
running (although I have been told about another in the South East)
