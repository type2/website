Subject: RE: [T2] '68 master cylinder kaput.... need one bad by Thursday
  eve...

All,
To update the list, I got the master cylinder from Ron _at_ bus depot dropped
on my door Thursday morning.  Got it installed Thursday evening..... packed
up and rolled out Friday morning heading from western PA to Manassas VA.
Had a great trip, visited battlefield, Old Town, Bug Out, met new people,
saw lots of beautiful country.  Thanks to the list for continued [mostly
lurker] support, and Ron for the service above and beyond the call of
duty... (counseling an order _at_ 11:30 P.M.).
Keep bussin'.
Mark
