&gt;The joints are the same '68-91, but I'm fairly certain that bus and Vanagon
&gt;axles are different lengths.

Ron is entirely correct, although there are detail changes with early CV's
featuring smaller balls and design varies manufacturer to manufacturer, all
are interchangeable '68 to '91.  Bus and vanagon axles are different lengths
(bus shorter) and automatic versus manual are different as well if I recall
correctly, autos having unequal length halfshafts I believe but I've never
compared a set when out or I don't recall.
