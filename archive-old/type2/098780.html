Subject: Exhaust stud question

Hello --

I have a 79 2l FI bus, GE case (hydraulic lifters), with a loose exhaust stud.

Right now, it was a standard 8mm exhaust stud in it (#3 cylinder), but it wiggles.  Does this engine have the 9x8 stud?  The bus depot, when I keyword search for exhaust stud, said that 8x8 AND 8x9 were for the 79 bus...my archive searching leads me to believe it is the 9mm stepped stud.  In addition, is it possible for the 8mm stud to thread into a 9mm hole in the first place?

Charles
