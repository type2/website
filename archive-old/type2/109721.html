 i guess i'm a bit confused here: does the &quot;filter pump&quot; oil system just 
 bolt on to the oil pump?  Shouldn't there still be hoses to route?
 
 For some reason i was under the impression that you needed to tap the case 
 to add any sort of filter.
  &gt;&gt;
no, that's the advantage of the filter pump.   You have to remove your old 
oil pump, and the filter pump cover is made so that the oil routes through to 
the filter which screws onto the cover, then from the filter through to the 
regular oil passages.  Hm,  pic would help huh?   Anyway, no drilling or tapping 
or hoses.

If you full flow it you need to drill and tap and use hoses.

is a picture on the oil filter pump on my 65 westy

you can't use this on the bay window 1600s as the engine brace across the 
back of the motor takes up that same space.
