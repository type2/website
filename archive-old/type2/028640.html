Rich,

I just used 3M spray mount and Black Throw rugs
from
yep.... again &quot;The Home Depot.&quot;  They cut nicely
with a
blade and the rubberized fiber coating cuts down
on a lot
of road noise due to my current tire set up.
Dunlop Winter
SP stud-able... frigen great in the snow, and I
mean like
a snow-cat.

The rugs are like $7.00 and you'll need 2.  I ran
(2) fitted
2x4's down the middle around 12&quot; apart center to
center.
The rug will add a little weight and you'll have a
nice backing
to mount another dome light center council some
day.

Subject: [T2] headliner question


I am looking to install some kind of headliner for
my
71 westy.  I have toyed with the idea of using
double
sided carpet tape and material from a local fabric
store.  Right now there is thin plywood up there.
I
am not even sure if there was a fabric liner on
the
original or the whitish yellow luann type stuff
that
is on the side walls and door panel.  I have also
considered just taping pictures up there from
previous
camping trips.  Does anyone have any
advice/stories?

Thanks

Rich
