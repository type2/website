&gt;    I know we have talked about this before, but I would like for you to
&gt; reply to me as I am in the market for new tires for my '79 bus. I am
looking
&gt; the best brand to buy. I am looking at 195/75 R14, Lt truck tire with a
&quot;D&quot;
&gt; rating and  can handle at least up to 50 psi. I would like feedback on
what
&gt; you feel is the best manufacture and any pro and cons. Any information
will
&gt; be greatly appreciated.

 You'll get a variety of opinions on this, probably about as many as you
get responses...

 IMHO, The big brands are the ones with a reputation to defend and they 
charge a premium to finance that defence. You may not necessarily get a
better tyre from them but you are unlikely to get a worse one. Any new
technology or design improvements are likely to be introduced on these
labels as well, since the price premium justifies the research.
 There probably isn't a &quot;best&quot; brand, though from a bus-driving point 
of view it'd be more sensible to shortlist the ones who compete in the
commercial vehicle sector, not those who focus on &quot;sporty&quot; products.
 Even that is questionable, though, given the list recommendations for
Yokohama &amp; Bridgestone tyres.

 Michelin are the biggest, I believe, and their &quot;Kleber&quot; brand is the OEM
fit for the T4/Eurovan. I think (not sure about this) that many baywindow 
busses were originally fitted with Michelins, too, though I assume that
there was a second source that would have been used concurrently.
 There have been posts to the list on delamination problems with 
Michelins- I don't know what would cause this but it doesn't really
dent my faith in them, to be honest. I expect that there are factories in
various places so perhaps the problem was specific to one of those? FWIW
my Agilis 81s are made in Germany, and if I was looking for a stock tyre
for a stock bus I would buy the Michelin Agilis 61 (185R14C, 99R) which is
a load range &quot;C&quot; tyre, the Agilis 81 is the load range &quot;D&quot; version (102R)
which I use in a 195/70R15C.

 Hope this is useful.

Cheers,
	 W.
