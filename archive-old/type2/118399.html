Subject: RE: [T2] fuel sender repair

I fixed one once, but if the wire broke in the center, you might be f'ed..It
works by resistance determined by the float position along the wires, which
must have a complete circuit..IF the wire just popped off the end, resolder.
Other wise the increase resistance of reair attempts will cause innaccuracy.



Volks,

I just pulled the gas tank out of my '71 bus last night and as I was
removing the fuel sender, the second of the 2 thin wires which run
vertically along the float shaft broke.

Does current run through these wires or are the just there to guide the
float?

The sender worked pre-removal, and I'd like to reuse it -- at least for
the time being -- if I can, especially given that the new sender runs $70
($70 which other parts of my bus direly needs).

Is this fixable?
