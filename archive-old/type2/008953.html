Al and all,

Sorry to get back to this. I've been rather busy and then my 
9G hard drive crapped out on me.  Anybody know where I can get 
the circuit board for a Micropolis 3391SS hard drive?  Maybe
have one tucked away in your parts boxes? &lt;G&gt;

Anyway, back to the 4BR8!

It has a plate labled Bosch  VJR 4BR8.  It's cast iron the upper
body has been turned down to size in a lathe.It's a centrifugal
advance.  There are 3 slot screws that go from the outside in to 
hold the points plate in place.  2 also hold the cap clips on and
the third is half way between and is over the name/model plate.
On the other side, the capaciter is mounted so the cap. is hanging
under the main body.  The wire goes up to an insulated stud and nut
setup to pass the circuit through the body.  On the inside, the
points are a 2 piece unit.  It appears that the spring side slides
down over a post and the bolt that goes through the body to attach
to the capaciter holds in the spring loaded unit.  Located on the
plate next to the solid mount point is a 4 with a line over it and
then a 6 with a line under it.  In between the lines is something
that looks like   !yI.

Ring any bells?  I'm thinking this baby is out of an OOOLD motor.

Thanks!

Mark

&gt; &gt; Greetings,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I was cleaning out my part boxes and found an 009 and a 4BR8
&gt; &gt; distributors.  They seem to be in excellent shape, heck the 009 is
&gt; &gt; almost new with the origional Bosch box!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Anyway, what would be a good selling price for them?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks!

&gt; Mark:
&gt; So, what does a 4BR8 fit? What's it look like? Vac or centrifugal, cast
&gt; iron or aluminum?
