&gt;OK, I see that.  But I was so excited actually to remove the alternator I
&gt;forgot to study the wiring hookup properly before I took it off.  Question:
&gt;does the B+ post connector (with the cap) go flush against the alternator
&gt;itself, or do I sandwich it between two nuts?  Does it matter? My removed
&gt;alternator's B+ post has a 10 mm nut on it right now.

There should be an insulating washer to keep the ring terminal from touching the alternator case.

&gt;Sure enough, my cooling boot is slightly torn.  I don't have another one,
&gt;natch.  But if I get one I'll want to replace it - how do I get it off??

There is a spring clip in the fan shourd that pulls out and releases the boot.

The boot was NLA until Ventura Warehouse Group (VWG) reproduced it. Anyone that carries one (BD, etc) gets it from VWG.
