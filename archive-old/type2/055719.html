George and All;

The Brazilian VW new longblocks available at Puyallup were supposedly 
&quot;all-Brazilian&quot;.  The heads were engineered for the long reach spark plugs.  I 
don't know if the cranks were cast or forged, but if I can find out I'll post 
to the List accordingly.

&gt;&gt; I like the idea of 3/4 reach plugs!  Much less likely to strip and probably 
more meat in that area of the head which might make it more crack-resistant.
