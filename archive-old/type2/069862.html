Subject: it's much BETTER than I thought :)

Hey all,
Further examining of my clutch problem has revealed that the problem is indeed with the clutch cable.  Seems the cable had stretched rather violently, causing the loud snap I heard and also causing the loss of shifting ability, as the clutch was out of adjustment after the stretch.  I assume that the cable would have broken pretty soon if it was stretching like that.

Thanks to all for their help.  This has been a roller coaster.  First I thought, new clutch cable.  Then I thought I might have to remove the engine because the clutch cable was intact.  Now it's back to new clutch cable.

Well, I'm happy 'cause that's cheap :)

Sean
