&gt; Plus, I REALLY want a GREEN one.

Hey there Mike,

Yep, 79 is the last year of the baywindow. 80 is the first year of
the vanagon.

From what I've seen Sage Green was available from 76-79 on the
Westies. BUT the deluxe wasn't offered in green in all those years.
(Karl, help me out here if I'm missing some details).

Since you're looking for a GREEN westy DELUXE, 1979 is not going to
be an option. The 79 deluxe (p27 mcode) came in Mexico beige only. 79
sage green was offered on the standard westy (p22).

I'm not sure about the 78's, but my green 78 was a standard camper
(p22), and I thought the deluxe was the champange edition (white over
brown). So 78 might not be an option for you either.

Now the 77 Deluxe westy came in sage green, so that's an option.
Pastel white (p21 mcode, hardtop camper) and chrome yellow are other
77 westy colors.

The 76 model year westies is where my mind turns to mush. I think the
deluxe was offered in green, but I'm not sure. 

I've got some info that I've collected on a webpage at:

http://www.geocities_dot_com/grnmnstr/vw/vwplaid.html

I'm trying to get all the colors combos (interior and exterior)
documented but it's taking awhile. I've got to get a digital camera,
so I can take some pics at shows to fill in some of the gaps in the
info.

Hope this helps, and good luck with your search.
