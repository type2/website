Subject: RE: Fuel Filler Necks are Back!

&gt; I assume this is for late baywindow buses, without a filler door and with
a
&gt; &quot;bent&quot; filler hose?

&gt;  Ron can you,or any other wise VW person confirm whether this filler
&gt;  neck is also the one suitable for Double &amp; Single Cabs ?

&gt; Is this the 49-state regular gas neck or the California unleaded neck with
&gt; the built in restricter?



This fits 74-79 bus or pickup and is the 49-state version (no unleaded fuel
restrictor). I am not sure if or how it could be modified to work on pre-74
busses, but they do have a different filler setup (as noted above). The neck
would work on California busses, although as someone noted, without the
unleaded restrictor it may not pass the visual inspection. (Then again, what
does California expect you to do if the &quot;proper&quot; California-only one is
simply not available at all?)
