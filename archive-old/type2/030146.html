While travelling on 101 I saw a nice looking '79 station wagon parked on
the frontage road just north of Atascadero and south of the Home Depot.

Bus had junk inside, but interior looked complete, including middle seat.
Engine bay was dusty, but everything looked intact and not too fiddled
with.  No significant rust that I could see.  Last tag was '94, indicating
a non-running bus.  Body was very straight.  aftermarket sunroof is only
real blemish on the body.  Sign said to call &quot;Ernie&quot; at 805-721-8855  I
think the price was $700.
