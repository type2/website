&gt; I would rather drive without the clutch (except starting and stopping)
&gt; as you get a feel for the engine and gearbox speeds and of course it
&gt; saves wear on the clutch and the cable. 

--&gt;  Someone told me once that driving like this on a regular basis would
wear out the syncros in the transmission.  Any truth to this?  It'd
certainly seem a false economy to wear them out just to save the clutch
disc.
