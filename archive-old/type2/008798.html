&gt; 
&gt; Just wondering how common vapor lock is in busses,
&gt; whether type II or type IV.
&gt; 
&gt; I see a lot of posts with symptoms that sound *very*
&gt; similar to vapor lock, but never seem to hear about
&gt; someone actually *having* vapor lock.

Well, one with fuel injection seems to be immune from it.  The
fuel is kept at a high pressure, is constantly circulated and the
fuel lines don't get very close to really hot things so the
fuel stays fairly cool.
