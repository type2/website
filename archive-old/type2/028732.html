&gt; My 71 Campmobile has no exhaust at present, but looking around in a local
&gt; junkyard, I found a &lt;73&gt;Beetle with intact exhaust and perfect, rust free
&gt; exchangers. I know the exhaust is different, the question is, are the
&gt; exchangers? Can I use 'em on my bus?


Yes and no.  If they are original VW ones (unlikely if they are perfect and
rust free), they will work but the linkage will be wrong, meaning that you
will be unable to open/close them from the dash.  However, it is possible to
either fabricate and spotweld a linkage bar onto the other side, or simply
wire them open with a piece of coathanger during the winter.  If they are
aftermarket Dansk ones (more likely), they already have both bus and bug
linkages on them so it should be a direct swap.
