Subject: Re: [T2] Leaky windshield seal

Jason,
Pull back the rubber a bit and inspect the metal under the moulding--if
it's good--and not bombed out run a indiscreet bead of silicone in the
gap---
them lean it up as I mentioned in my earlier posting--

Now--I have seen some of the other pictures that have been sent--and
what you have to  realize is there is a point of no return--if the metal
is adios--well--all your going to do is prolong the inevitable--

If the panel is pretty much in tact --seal it for now--save your
rubles---and buy a new seal and windshield--soon.
PPG glass is good--and they fit--
I had a dark tinted one installed in my driveway for $115.00---total.
My moulding is good, so  had no problem with that.

This is how I would approach this problem--

From the picture's the area doesn't look too bad--How is the metal under
the seal?

Later,
