Subject: Re: [T2] Couple of air circulation questions


I am going camping this evening after work. I will have my passenger look
into this. It is driving me nuts as well. Last night I had my passenger try
to isolate the noise and she thought it was the door seal, but I am not so
sure because the seal is in as good a shape as all the others and they
don't whistle. A few weeks ago someone broke into Possum and stole her
stereo, they got in via the vent window, perhaps damaged it then...

&gt;It definately seems like the whistling is coming from my vent wing window

Hey, I think I have the same problem as you describe above.  The noise
seems to be coming from the passenger vent wing, but I have found that I
can reduce/eliminate the squealing by rolling the passenger window down
ever so slightly.  Not enough that there is even a gap, but so that the
window is not quite all the way up in the channel.  By any chance does
yours react the same way?  If so, at least we could be fairly sure we have
the same problem.  It's driving me absoultely nuts!  All I can think of to
troubleshoot this is to start masking over certain areas with some wide
masking tape and see if the problem goes away.  I'm going to start with the

passenger vent wing, but I haven't had time to start on it yet.  Please let

me know if you find a solution.

Thanks,

-David
