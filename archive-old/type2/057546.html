Subject: '81 2.0L F.I. gaskets??

Just putting new heads on this T-4 and in the gasket kit are the two
riser blocks which go on, of course. There are also four metal/composite
gaskets which look like they only could go on these intake ports as
well. The engine had a Weber carb on it, but I'm putting FI back on it.
    The Haynes manual doesn't show anything but the composite riser
blocks, and makes no mention of these metal gaskets. I've got a Bentley,
but only for the earlier T-4 engines (up to '79), and most stuff in this
area is exactly the same, but in there too I see no picture of these
gaskets, nor mention of them.
    So ---- ???? Do they go on top of the blocks? Or not at all? Or
---???
