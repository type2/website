&gt; What are your opinions on balancing a bread-and-butter 1600?  I wanted
&gt; to do that when I had mine built, but the VWFLAPS talked me out of it,
&gt; telling me it was overkill on a stock engine.  I can't help but think
&gt; it would help *some*.
&gt;
&gt; Also, I was re-reading Bruce Anderson's 911 Performance Handbook, and
&gt; there is a description of a process called &quot;boattailing&quot; the case, basically
&gt; &quot;porting&quot; the area of the case under the pistons, to improve airflow.
&gt; This is supposed to buy you up to 10hp on an early engine.  Anyone do
&gt; this on VW's?  How about piston squirters?

Thom:
&quot;Some&quot; would be the key word here. &quot;enough&quot;? Maybe. Most everything is speed
related. Most forces vary as the square of the speed.  In the case of
boat-tailing, I think they are referring to cleaning up the rough edges on the
inside of the case to reduce oil windage losses. Such losses are  quite a bit more
at the 6500-7300 rpms that early 911's (S's anyway, 906's go 8000) operate at. The
hp loss could easily be twice that of a VW at 4500. Still, 5 hp would be a welcome
improvement, plus, it will lower  the oil temperatures, which makes everyone
happy.
Same for the balancing, not as  big a deal at 4500 as at 6500, but still nothing
to sneeze at, particularly if it gives a little more engine life. Same would go
for a counterbalanced crank.
