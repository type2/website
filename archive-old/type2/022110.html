&gt;I think I get frustrated because I can't explain to the impatient
&gt;drivers that I'm going as fast as I can!  I recently saw a bumper
&gt;sticker on a bus that says it all very clearly:
&gt;
&gt;	TOO SLOW?
&gt;	TOO BAD!

  Yeah, I made up my own &quot;stickers&quot; based on some similar sayings I have
seen on the net.  On the left side of the bus I have &quot;0 to 55 in 11
minutes&quot;, and on the back window I have one to ward off all those angry
drivers behind me telling me to get moving, &quot;It IS floored!&quot;  I think I
have seen someone selling these stickers on one of the VW sites, but,
impatient as I am to wait for deliveries in the mail, I figured I'd just
print up my own and stick them to the inside of the windows with contact paper.

  I must say that since putting the stickers on last year, I can't think of
any time when anyone has flipped me off or even scowled when passing me.
In fact, very often at a stoplight I will look in the rearview and catch
someone laughing and pointing out the stickers to their passengers.  Alot
of times, 
too, I'll get waves and smiles as they blow by me.  Can't hurt, and it's
alot less confrontational than &quot;Too slow? TOO BAD!&quot;, which seems to me
would just make people angrier at our slow buses! :-)
