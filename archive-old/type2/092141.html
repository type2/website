Subject: Re: [T2] brake booster

Jamie,

There's a vent that goes up into the body from the front side.  You
probably knew this but throwing it out (it took me a while to figure out
what that other hose was when I first was lurking under my van).  

Could it be that the vent hose is plugged and the vacuum side has enough
pull to suck in water or brake fluid or both instead?  Another idea is
that there is a leak into the body where the vent is and it's sucking
that water in.

Pulling at straws or brain storming.  However it hits you.

Let us know if you find something!

&gt; What would make a power brake system fill the booster with fluid, and pull the
