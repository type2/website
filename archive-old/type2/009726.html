Sounds like an idea.  I'll give it a try next weekend.
Oh, to the OTHER Mark &lt;G&gt;  I've already opened the aux air valve 
adjustment all the way. 

Thanks all!
Mark

&gt; Not sure if this is your problem but it happened to me...
&gt; 
&gt; Check the double relay. If you don't have voltage on the pin that goes to
&gt; the aux air valve it won't matter if it is in good working order or not, it
&gt; won't close. For some reason I don't understand, the copper trace burned up
&gt; on the circuit board in the double relay. I just soldered in a wire to
&gt; replace the trace. I tested the double relay to make sure it was functioning
&gt; correctly and reassembled it all. It has been working correctly ever since
&gt; the repair, three years ago.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Cold and hot idle!!!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;When it's cold, say sitting for a couple of hours, etc. it fires right
&gt; &gt;up but idles at about 600 RPM.  Then, after a couple minutes, when it's
&gt; &gt;hot, the RPM climbs to about 1100RPM.  The AUX air vlalve seems to
&gt; &gt;be OK.  I took it out cold and put 12V across the terminals and the
&gt; &gt;little slide closed in it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Any ideas? &lt;G&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Thanks!
&gt;
