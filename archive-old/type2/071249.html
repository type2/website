Subject: First year for buses with air-conditioning??
Date: Mon, 16 Nov 1998 14:04:00 -0500
Encoding: 19 TEXT

Does anyone know what the first year was that VW decided to include
A/C in their buses.  I would imagine it was on a Water cooled model.
I am scheming up a plan to build my dream bus and I am looking into
the AC option.

On second thought....anyone got a split window type 2 with a 1600, dual
carbs, Air Cond. and in fair to good condition they would like to part
with??

Later,
