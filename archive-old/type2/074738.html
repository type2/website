Subject: Re: [T2] Wide 5 balanceing

Many stores that sell tires to big trucks have to spin balance them this 
way - they use a strobe light also.

&gt;Tom,
&gt;     You might wanna check out some of the older gas stations in your area 
&gt; and
&gt;see if they have a spin balancer.  The kind that balance the tire still on
&gt;the car, or in this case, Bus.  I myself am looking for an old bubble
&gt;balancer.  I had to make an adapter for wide fives for my tire machine,
&gt;seems I can make one for the balancer.  I'm leaning toward an old wheel
&gt;adapter.
