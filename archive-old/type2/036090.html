&gt; Hey list I tried to help a friend yesterday buy a 77 automatic bus. It
&gt; needs a new starter and the owner had one,which we agreed to replace so we
&gt; could see if the van runs or not. So here we are 2 somewhat knowledgeable

remember an automatic takes a different starter than a manual,  an auto
starter will work in many manuals, but not vice versa.  there is no front
bearing on an auto starter.

&gt; VW enthusists trying for 3 hours to get the old starter out. Got the bottom
&gt; bolt out no problem but the top bolt has a small phlange surrounding the
&gt; bolt head so we could only get a small bit of the wrench around it. Tried

top bolt is also the engine mount bolt, the flange is to keep it from
turning so you can un bolt it from inside the engine comp.  top right
engine mount bolt.  take this one out first then the lower one...

&gt; shame and walk away. Its a 77 fuel injected engine not sure of the cc's.

77 FI should be a 2 liter

good luck
Bob
