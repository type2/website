Subject: fuel sender repair

Volks,

I just pulled the gas tank out of my '71 bus last night and as I was 
removing the fuel sender, the second of the 2 thin wires which run 
vertically along the float shaft broke.  

Does current run through these wires or are the just there to guide the 
float?

The sender worked pre-removal, and I'd like to reuse it -- at least for 
the time being -- if I can, especially given that the new sender runs $70 
($70 which other parts of my bus direly needs).

Is this fixable?

Thanks,
     Tom
