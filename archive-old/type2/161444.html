Subject: RE: [T2] Idle problem

Thanks, Will.

I was hoping this one wouldn't leave me slapping my head and feeling stupid,
but I almost succeeded.  :)

Yes, this problem has been resolved.  I was out of town over the weekend and
so I left the bus with the mechanic.  He left me a message on Saturday saying
he got it running, but didn't explain how - the last we talked on Friday, he
was going to do a flow test on the fuel pump.  I called him this morning and
he said the valves were too tight.  Well, that was one thing I didn't check.
He said it wasn't getting enough compression at idle.  He adjusted the valves,
and from there everything else adjusted fine.

If I'd just started from the beginning, I guess I could've fixed this all
myself and saved some headaches, including the purchase of a new carb.  Oh
well.  With hindsight, now I understand why it ran like crap at spec timing
and had to be advanced a few degrees.  With all that fixed, the brake booster
appears to be operable, and that just means I need to replace my master
cylinder now to get the brakes in safe working order.

Thanks for all of your input and suggestions, they're very much appreciated!

Take care,

John
