I was installing a compufire unit in my 009 and noticed that the rotor disk 
has a slight off set and a line on the top of the disk. Is there a certain 
way the rotor should be oriented, such as to retard #3? I started the engine 
and it ran normal. The installation direction make no mention of specific 
orientation. Any feedback welcomed.
