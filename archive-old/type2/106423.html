Subject: RE: [T2] Sliding Window Gaskets

&gt; 	I just ordered a set of sliding windows from Busted 
&gt; Bus. However, they didn't have the gaskets for it. I ordered 
&gt; a set gaskets from Westburg West and they assured me that the 
&gt; solid bus window gaskets were the same as the ones used for 
&gt; the sliding windows. Is this true?


Yes it is.

Incidentally, we carry new OEM sliding windows for busses (as well as
new European made seals), for anyone who prefers new to used. $132.95
each for the windows (parts 56631and 56632, left and right
respectively.)
