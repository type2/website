Subject: Vanagon for sale

I am not the seller, but spotted this next to my place:
Ad says &quot;1987 Vanagon Westfalia tons of miles but runs and drives
well, 750$ 619 276 1315&quot;

I add : &quot;Read 280k miles on odometer, front seats are worn but camping
equipment including pop top is decent. Front tires OK, rear shot, has
something that looks like BBS rims. No oil drips under engine. Sliding
door is dented. Not much rust. Grey. Manual.

I can go take a photo if you are interested.

The bus is on Clairemont Boulevard in San Diego CA, In front of Keil's store.

- Arnaud
