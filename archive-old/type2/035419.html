Subject: Carby, Oil and Air Coolers + Tinware

*First, sorry for such a lengthy post... coffee and refreshments will be
served after. :-)
Hi Everyone,
I'm just about to start work on my '69 Kombi (van) and was wondering if
anyone had any sage advice.
The carby is shot (huge backfiring, fuel leaking [okay, pouring, the float
is not floating,] and sticky accelerator probs),  the oil cooler valves (I
think) are shot because it gushes oil when its warm, and the round tinware
(on the fan housing) behind the generator it turns out was actually for a
beetle, not a kombi and is pushing everything out of line. (belt jumps off,
bad thing right?)

So.... since I'm a bit fiscally challenged at the moment, I've decided to
save and do the job myself. (It's taken 2 months to get to this stage. At
the moment I've got a 'spare room' in my driveway)
I bought a copy of John Muirs &quot;How to keep your volkswagen alive&quot; and have
read it cover to cover, hunted high and low on the net and have my fingers
crossed that I'll find some people who may have a few tips to save me some
grief.
Never having worked on a car (let alone a VW) before, I'm a bit nervous,
alot excited and slightly nauseous. (can't even spell)
I was hoping  to learn..
1. is there anything 'specific' about replacing a carby I need to be aware
of?
2. the 'pan' type of air cooler (with the oil in it), is that better than
the foam filter type I have on at the moment....?
3. to exchange the tinware (that round bit on the fan housing), am I better
off not attempting that myself? (I'm brave, but not totally stupid.)

I'm looking through all the stuff on the type2 website, gleaning as much as
I can. If there are any tips or hints anyone would have, I'd be very
grateful!

Thanks, yours in grease,

Cassandra.
