Subject: timing and generator question

seems to be alot of problems with the 34 pict 3 and 009 what does the list 
think of svda from aircooled_dot_net?
why do some (wolfsburgwest)vendors alt. kit come with a fuel pump?
will my pump not work?

&gt;&gt;You will also need a bug alternator or generator fan hub to properly
position the fan.  The bus hub won't work.

do i need to worry about the hub if i replace with alt. kit?
