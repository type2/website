Subject: Bus/Bug wheel swap question

Fellow and sister listers:
I picked up some nice Empi 8-spoke, 15&quot; wheels with a standard Bug (4 bolt)
pattern. I'd really like to put them on my '71 Bus. Two questions:

1. Are there any particular concerns I should have about replacing my 14&quot;
bus wheels with the 15&quot; bug wheels, other than wheel-well clearance issues.
(My plan is to put on a 15&quot; tire that would have the same approximate
profile dimensions as the 14&quot;'s now on the bus).

2. I can't seem to find anyone who sells
5-bolt-bus-pattern-to-4-bolt-Bug-pattern wheel adaptors. I know that
Wheel-Adapt probably makes something, but their stuff is really expensive,
and I don't want to pay more for the adaptors than I did for the wheels.
Does anyone have any leads, or better, a solution (like swapping drums, or
new drums)that would make this swap work?

Many thanks in advance for any and all advice.

Regards, Steve Leonard
