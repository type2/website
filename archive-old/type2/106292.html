Subject: Bosch H4 headlight question

Hey. If any of you folks are running the Bosch H4 conversion, maybe you can 
answer a quick question for me. I just got a deal on a set from our favorite 
online auction site and installed them this evening. I noticed that the 
lenses appear to have a &quot;coating&quot; on the inside that appears to be a series 
of &quot;swirls&quot;, for lack of a better word, that make the lenses cloudy when 
viewed from the outside, with the lights off. With the lights on, this same 
coating at first made the lights seem unfocused and diffused when viewed from 
any angle but straight on. From straight on, however, the lights are 
EXTREMELY bright and crisply focused. But only from that position. So much so 
that it took me several minutes to regain my sight after I was dumb enough to 
stare into them. So the question is: Is this the way they are supposed to be, 
or did I get a bum deal, and if this is kosher, what kind of coating is on 
the lens to make it non-glare when viewed from any other angle that dead 
ahead?
Slowly recovering from retinal burns,
Robb
