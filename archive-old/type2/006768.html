All,

I recently switched from Farmer's Insurance to Allstate for my '79
homebrew campermobile.  I called it &quot;an RV&quot; and told them that I
wanted it insured (collision) for $10k.

So, now I have liability (more than minimum amounts), collision
(10k), theft ($10k), theft of contents ($3k), hail, fire ($10k),.
Deductible is $250.

It costs me about $175 per 6 mos.  There's a theoretical mileage
limit of 7,500 miles per year, but they don't check the odometer.
The insurance agent said, &quot;$10,000 for a '79?&quot;

I told her about all the new stuff I'd installed over the past
year (engine, tranny, CVs, ball joints, tie rods, bearings,
brakes, starter, alternator, and so on).

When she went out for a cursory inspection of said RV, she asked,
&quot;Is everything installed right now?&quot;

I told her that the stove and refrigerator weren't, as I'm still
in the process of fixing it up.  That seemed to be okay with her,
and she wrote me up the policy.

The policy's provisions are that the RV is not to be driven more
than three miles each day to work (my office is in a house in my
back yard), and not to be driven by anyone younger than 25.

So, try Allstate or another company.  BTW, Allstate and my former
insurer, Farmer's, are co-defendants in a class-action lawsuit for
allegedly overcharging car owners over the past few years.  So, I
may have some money coming from Farmer's -- Hah!
