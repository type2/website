&gt; Many of us on this list are ratcheting our buses ever upward, making 
&gt; decisions about what counts as a priority repair (and therefore 
&gt; justifies the expense of quality parts and work), and what counts as a 
&gt; luxury (fix it with wire for now, get to it next year). Given the 
&gt; conditions in which most of our buses start we  get them, this is the 
&gt; only reasonable thing to do. The average bus on the road today could 
&gt; _easily_ eat up $10,000 and still require some work.
