it's the smoke in the mirrors that worries me about this scenario.

which idiot light came on, by the way? the &quot;GEN&quot; light should have come on
as soon as the pulley/fan stopped turning.

if you had the OIL light come on after 3 miles of no fan, i am afraid that
chances are good the engine has been severely overheated. this would also
imply the GEN light was not working properly.
