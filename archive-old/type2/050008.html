&gt; I have a 72 bus with a t4 engine in it.  It has a single double barrel Weber 
&gt; in it.  On tuesdaymy friend and I hopped in the bus to go to my aunts house 
&gt; in Massachusettes which is about a 3 1/2 hour drive.   The bus ran fine until 
&gt; we stopped at about the half way point to go to the bathroom.  I left the car 
&gt; running while we went.  We came back out and got back on the road.  About a 
&gt; 1/2 hour down the road the bus started to I guess bog out, like no gas was 
&gt; getting to the engine.  So now the bus is slowing down and I don't know what 
&gt; to do so I started to pull over and it kicked back in and I started going 
&gt; again.  This happened about every minute so I forced the bus to go the rest 
&gt; of the trip.  When we arrived at our destination I went to a gas station and 
&gt; got some dry gas thinking that our problem was because moisture in the tank.  
&gt; The dry gas helped a lot and I'm thinking of getting another one because the 
&gt; bus still does it but only at higher rpm's.  I would like to get a solution 
&gt; on this before I leave to go
&gt;  back to jersey tomorrow (Friday).  So if anyone can please help it is much 
&gt; appreciated. 
&gt; 
&gt; Thank You
&gt; Jon
