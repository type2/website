Subject: Re: [T2] Q about inspecting a new engine after assembly

Thanks Dave.

Flywheel endplay is getting done. How do you get feelers back there?
I'd hate to have to find a dial indicator (though I should get one
anyway...)

Pulley still needs to be purchased. Any stock weight degreed pulleys
out there? My quick search just turned up lightened ones...

In the valve train everything looks ok except the pushrods appear to
be rubbing on the tubes. Does that straighten out during running? Or
is it normal?

I still need the hoses and filter mount for the full flow.

Haven't started fitting tin yet. Waiting for the other bits like a pulley.

The flash is ok? I'll try the paint. I was actually considering VERY
thinned out bbq paint from a spray bottle. I know it's good for
watercooled engines and figured it would be worthwhile to color the
heads and cyls on my ACVW engine too.

I'm going to double check ALL the bolts that are accessible with the
engine assembled. Including (especially!) the head nuts.
