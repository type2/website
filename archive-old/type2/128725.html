You know the PPM measurement seems a bit misleading... Okay my VW is allowed xxx PPM, and the new 4WD SUV whatever is allowed 1/2 that. However, how many million parts does that SUV put out in 10K miles and how much does the VW? 

Seems like a little car with a dirty engine could alot further still than a big clean buring SUV and still pollute an equal amount... 

Maybe how much volume of exhaust does a vehicle put out in a distance and how much of that if &quot;bad&quot;? 

Now how much bad stuff does our properly tuned VW contribute and how much does the SUV contribute in 10K miles. 

Chris
