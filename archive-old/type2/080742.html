Subject: World Bus and Web Page Update

Hey Folks,
     Got a Bus Depot order today. Rear side marker lenses made in India, =
tie rods made in Turkey(!), a front spare tire mount made in Taiwan, and =
tail light housings of unknown origin. Now, please don't take this as a =
slam on the Bus Depot, quite the contrary-it's all nice quality stuff, =
especially the tail light housings, just had to laugh when I saw all the =
different countries the parts for our beloved buses come from now. Also =
found a picture of my '77, taken the day I had it towed home-what a sad =
sight it was back then. I remember standing there looking at it thinking =
&quot;My God, what have I done?!&quot;. It's pretty much done now, and after last =
weekend's campout, it was worth it. I put the picture on my web page, =
along with an &quot;after&quot; shot.   Jeff
