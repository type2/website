Subject: re: rescue ambulance bus donations format

To our community,

On September 8, 2001 we found a toy rescue ambulance bus on eb*y. With
several days left on the auction we left proxy bidding to do the work for
us. Needless to say that with the tragic events that unfolded on September
11, 2001 we had completely forgot about trivial matters such as this. Not
until September 14, 2001 when the auction ended did remember and did we
realize the symbolism of it. We cannot help but  believe that this toy bus
has a message to give. As we struggle with these tragic times we often
question the significance of our earthly possessions and trivial habits.
Yet, we, as bus owners, feel a sense of community through our buses. As many
know and as this toy reminds us, allot of these buses were used as emergency
vehicles in the past, if not in this country many around Europe. We would
like to us this toy bus as an avenue for our community to support the men
and women of our nations emergency response teams. With this, 10 % of all
used parts sales will be donated to the families of those who lost their
lives in Tuesday’s tragedies. As we restore, fix, and drive our buses we can
hold our heads high knowing that once these buses gave, and we too can give.

Please visit our website for a photo of this bus at www.bustedbus_dot_com
Here at BUStedBUS we are starting to get things back on track in our hearts
and in our lives.
