Subject: Re: [T2] Electric Fuel Pump, YES or NO?

Hello Guys and dolls  I use both types depending on the bus. Type 1 I like 
using the FI bug block for building motors . It seems to be stronger, but it has 
no place for a mec. pump,so instead of machining the block I use a low 
presure elec. pump, works well but can vapor lock depending on where you place it. 
Also the elec' pump is probably cheaper than the mech. pump which  every VW bus 
owner wants. I also always carry a spare elec pump when traveling . Can be 
used on just about buses except FI  ones. Yes they can be  a danger in accidents 
but only if the key is left on. Later and have fun   Mark Dearing  Salem
