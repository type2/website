Subject: RE: [T2] electrical gremlins and kvetching.

Have you checked your cold start valve? If it is leaking it will over-rich
the bus and if the thermo-switch is broken and keeping it open, it will over
fuel the motor. At idle it will be ok, but when you need more fuel it can
run super-rich.

Just a start.

well the engine is mostly the same, have replaced most vacuum lines,
waiting for some odd sizes to be delivered. but phutzing with the lines
seems to have no effect

&gt; Re-trace all your plug wires and check your timing and vacuum advance,
&gt; y'know, basic stuff.

yeah, I think I'm past the &quot;normal&quot; stuff...
&gt;
&gt; Do you smell fuel?

pretty much normal, when trying to start it smells of being flooded but
when running no. and I had fuel presure guage set up and it was factory
spec
