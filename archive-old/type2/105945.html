Subject: Re: [T2] wiring help???

Did your bus have two bulbs before?? Important question. I had a 71 bus
before and it just had one tailight bulb. Way different wiring system from
having separate bulbs like later bays. No problem getting the brake lights
to work, but getting the turn signals to flash while you are on the brake
pedal will drive you nuts. Make sure you have somebody do this while you
check it. Have them stand on the brakes so the lights come on, and turn on
the left then right signals. Make sure they flash while the brake lights are
on.

BTW, I put those same oldvolks tailights in my 70, they look and work great.
No problemos, I like them. Just have someone  hit the brakes while you use a
circuit tester light to see which of the tailight wires gets hot.

&lt;I just installed a new wiring harness for my 71 single cab and am having
problems getting the brake lights to work.

I have installed new taillights from Old Volks of Arizona.  They use a
double filament bulb and only have one bulb each.

I have looked over the Bentley (with color) and the wiring diagrams to the
taillights leave much to be desired.&gt;
