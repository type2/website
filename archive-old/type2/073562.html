Subject: Re: [T2] Heat riser Plugged SP conversion

one gasket of each is the correct way to do it, but the small ones are hard
to find...This keeps the flow of the carbon going only one way, and it does
not begin to collect in the center of the manifold.

&gt; &gt; Here is the trick...
&gt; &gt; Drill 2 (about 9mm)holes....At the point where the heat riser tube makes
&gt; &gt; it's sharp bend, under the manifold, do this in a manner where you are
&gt; &gt; creating a straight shot through the blocked riser tube.....
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Find a welding rod (1/8&quot;) and strip all the shielding from it
&gt; &gt; bend a small area in it, almost like a hook. chuck it intal a drill, and
&gt; &gt; insert into the blocked area...Ream the heck out of it and keep soaking
it
&gt; &gt; with spray carburetor cleaner..
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; After you are done, weld the 2 holes back up and you are done..
&gt;
&gt; I do the same thing, except that I block the hole with a stainless hose
&gt; clamp.  A film of red RTV seals it up fine.  Next time, I can ream it out
&gt; without further drilling.  I only drill one side, btw.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; This is the best method I have found to get all the crud out.....Using
the
&gt; &gt; proper heat riser gaskets, which are really hard to find does the job
and
&gt; &gt; keeps the heat riser flow going only one direction, keeping this from
&gt; &gt; happening......
&gt;
&gt; Hmmm, which are the correct gaskets, the big hole ones or the teeny hole
&gt; ones?  which goes where?
