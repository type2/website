Subject: Re: [T2] Need help with 2.0 specs

Thanks for your input Dave.  I'm wondering though - what about the gross 
discrepancy between the rod journal sizes listed in the Tom Wilson
book?  The 2.0 specs they show a 1.5xx&quot; rod journal for the Vanagon and
the rod journal on an older T4 baywindow 2.0L is listed as a
1.9xx&quot; something or nother.  Does this mean the journals on the AC Vanagon
engines were smaller and thusly weaker than its baywindow
counterpart?  Just curious.

NQ  

BTW:  Thanks for the assistance on this - I'm a newbie for sure.
