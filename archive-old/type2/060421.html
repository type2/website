&gt; hi volks, anyone on the list going to the show this weekend near tampa
&gt; florida.   ill be there........_dot_cant miss me. large british gentleman.....

I plan to be there, and I believe David Easterwood of Atlanta 
mentioned it, as well as Steve Curvey and Jeff Wilson of the 
Tallahassee VW club, and Dennis Farr of Tampa -- all listees on 
bus, beetle, or ghia lists.

Camping at Hillsborough River State Park is my first choice, 
although I may stay in Tampa Friday nite, since the Bulli Brigade 
show at Reeves VW in Tampa is Sat.

Folks within driving distance - these are two big events, should be 
well worth your while.

My hair's grown out, so look for a fortyish dark-haired hippie-type in 
VW apparel.  Won't be more than a couple hundred.  I'll try to 
narrow it down by wearing my old Aircooled Search &amp; Rescue or 
vanagon_at_l tshirt.  Hope to see y'all there -- save me one of them 
Cal-look Hebmuller kits, wouldja?
