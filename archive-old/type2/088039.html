If the bus you are wanting for the engine has been towed under the abatement
law, you cannot get it back to save the drivetrain or anything else. It does
not matter if you tell them you are not going to register it etc. It can only
go to a licensed dismantler. Unless you are a licensed dismantler?
Here is the law. Annex 2A talks about the disposal of the vehicle.
http://www.chp_dot_ca_dot_gov/html/vehabate.html
(f) of Contents of Ordinance 22661 on page 2-A-4
and the last section on that page: Disposition Of Vehicle or Parts 22662 which
continues on to the next page.

Before you make any plans for that bus/engine, make SURE it wasn't towed under
the abatement law. Having a valid pink slip does not mean squat in this case!
I learned all about it a while back when I wanted a Glas. Glas were made in
Germany and was the parent company for Gogomobile. All I could was watch it
get crushed after parts were sold off it ;-(


&gt; &lt;I bought a 77 (out of state to Cal) couldn't transfer title and ended up
&gt; cutting it up in my garage. Quite a learning experience.&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Sobering thoughts, indeed! However, with this particular vehicle, it would
&gt; be scrapped. I would just want the engine and tranny, possibly the front
&gt; end, servo, etc. This particular bus is not worth restoring, even though
&gt; it's had no real body damage. It's was a transporter, but no seats or
&gt; interior left, and it is very rusty overall and super ugly. The only good
&gt; thing is that it runs excellent and has very good brakes. As long as I get
&gt; the pink, I can trailer what's left down to the scrap yard and they'll take
&gt; it. I wouldn't touch anything without a valid pink, under any circumstances.
