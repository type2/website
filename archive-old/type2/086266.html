Subject: Aftermarket Tents

I just bought a brand new aftermarket tent. It is called a Campermate vane
tent model 895. Unfortunately i cannot find anything about it on the
internet but it has an awning that you drive under right up beside the tent
allowing you to leave the tent. I got it for $109.99 Canadian which is about
$70 American. Seems like solid poles and i am very excited to go camping
with it. I got it at Campers Village if anyone in Canada would like to try
and find one. It listed for $279.99 regular price but i think it may be
discontinued.
Good luck,
