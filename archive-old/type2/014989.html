Not sure about your setup, but I've found stalling-at-idle is often
traceable back to a vacuum leak. Of course, might just be something you

Good luck! Joe

&gt;Anyway, the &quot;Adjustment Data Table&quot; that came with the rebuild kit listed
&gt;the following vehicles as having this carb.  This is for the benefit of
&gt;those wanting to do a junkyard search.
&gt;
&gt;71 Capri 2L, Pinto 2L w/AC
&gt;72 &amp; 73 Capri-Pinto 2L, Capri 2.6L
&gt;74 Bobcat-Capri-Pinto 2L, Bobcat-Mustang II-Pinto 2.3L, Capri-MustangII 2.8L
&gt;75 Capri-Mustang-Pinto 2.3L
&gt;76 Bobcat-Pinto-Capri 2.3L
&gt;
&gt;Results not guaranteed.
