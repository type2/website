Subject: Re: [T2] Masonry Sand?

Dan,

My 100 lbs Brute Blaster does the same thing occasionally, and does it
with or without new or used sand.
I contacted the Mfg. shortly after I bought the thing 20 some years ago,
and they told me flat out that it's the nature of the beast, and if I'm
not using an air dryer it'll happen more often.

Sorry I can't possibly top what the guys that build the stuff have told
me..

Maybe you can call Granger--find out who makes their blasting equipment,
call them and come up with some better answer's.
Maybe they have some better answer's.

I don't know who makes your blaster.

I'd try this prior to asking an equipment trouble shooting / failure
question on an internet vehicle related list.
