Subject: How to:  Break your motor mounts

A recent thread about replacing motor mounts prompts me to post this
friendly little reminder to all you 'shade-tree' mechanics:

Do not EVER jack up your type IV motored bus (don't know about the
uprights) by placing a jack underneath the engine itself.  Don't even do
it to raise the rear just a little.  When you do this, the weight of the
back of the bus is being suspended by those poor little chunks of rubber
we call motor mounts and it will simply rip them in half.
