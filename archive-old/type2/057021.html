Visiting Deutschland, what fun!

My only suggestion is to visit the VW factory in Wolfsburg.  A museum 
and guided tour are available.  Also, I found an interesting history of 
the Volkswagen corporation on the VW Australia site at 
http://www.volkswagen_dot_com.au/ that you may want to read before you get 
there.  Click on &quot;history&quot; once in the website.  It turns out that VW 
management has an admirable record of good worker relations.  Enjoy!
