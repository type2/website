a friend(?) also broke off the nut when we were bledding the brakes
so it will have to be drilled out as well so i am hoping i dont have to
bleed again in the near future.

anyone help me out?


I have been successful in tapping the square handle end of a file into the
broken bleed nipple and extracting it, but it's no really big deal. New
brake cylinders are pretty cheap and easy to fix.
