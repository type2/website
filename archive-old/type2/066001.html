So Ian Hallett says:

&gt; Australians have a tradition of doing things in their shed. One of our folk 
&gt; troubadors, John Williamson, even wrote a song about them (&quot;Every Aussie 
&gt; bloke needs a shed - to think about the things his woman said&quot;). 

I wonder if this goes along with the 'Venus &amp; Mars' book about men and
women and the fact that the man sometimes needs to be in his cave?  :)

Or is it, cage?    ;)
