Subject: Re: [T2] Acts like out of gas - long update (was engine
  coughing)

Listees,
    Thanks for all the input. Your help was much appreciated.
It appears that the fuel pump was bad. I replaced it and have not had any
more issues. I am still learning and one day hope to be an expert as many on
the list are, but at least I was in the right ballpark thinking it was fuel
related.
    I originally thought that it was good for several reasons. 1. acted up
only at top speed 2. plenty of pressure built up in the line when I removed
it from the carb.
    My mechanic popped the line from the carb and had me turn the engine
over, he said the fuel should shoot out a couple of feet. Mine didn't even
clear the bumper. Is this an accurate test if one does not have a tee and a
pressure guage?
Later,
Jim
