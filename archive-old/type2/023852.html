&gt;Turns out the Cop also collects VW's on the side... Did you 
&gt;budget bail in your vacation ?? 
As an insurance investigator in a former life I once ruined someones day..
they were making a claim for damages on a *brand new* 88 Range Rover..
I took one look and laughed...It was a 2 door..never offically imported and at
*least* 4 years old Most investigators might not have noticed but, other than
the wrong # of doors, It had come over on the same boat as my buddy's *legal*
early land rover...I *knew* I'd seen this truck before...I didn't follow it
much, but *somebody* went to jail..
You *can* get a title for a 10 year old or older vehicle using a title
service..but the year and vin must be correct...and it costs upward of
$200..I've done that on a &quot;re-poed&quot; 84 van...and two weeks later that original
owner came through with the title and an apology...
If *you* know it &quot;ain't&quot; somebody else is going to also...run away...
