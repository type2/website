Here's a little Friday song.  Feel free to add/delete/modify.  

To the tune of 'Cocaine' by J.J. Cale (With apologies to Eric Clapton and 
Unca Joel - *the* lyricist of the Type2/Vanagon lists) 

Slow Lane 
- --------- 
If they want to go zoom, you've got to give 'em room. Slow lane.  
'Cause your Bus may break down, you may be shoulder bound. Slow lane.  
Please keep right, please keep right, please keep right.  Slow lane. 

With an old 40-horse, there's just one lane, of course.  Slow lane.  
With the resto done, what's your hurry son?  Slow lane.  
Please keep right, please keep right, please keep right.  Slow lane. 

Now your &quot;Thing&quot; is gone, it's a Bus you ride on.  Slow lane.  
Don't forget this fact, you'll always hold them back.  Slow lane.  
Please keep right, please keep right, please keep right.  Slow lane.  

Please keep right, please keep right, please keep right.  Slow lane. 

- ---------
