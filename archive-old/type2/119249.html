Subject: Re: [T2] Towing a bus

&gt; &gt; I wouldn't sweat it with that tow car....just make sure that you
&gt; &gt; watch your stopping distance very carefully.

I just towed a '73 bus from Akron, OH to Ft. Wayne, IN with my 11 year-old
daughter in my '96 Chrysler Town &amp; Country.
Actually...the bus sort of pushed us home. It did stress the brakes, which
were not perfect anyway.
I guess it was not the most conservative, wise thing to do...but it was fun
and made my daughter and I smile :-)
So if you think it will make you smile, DO IT...so it may cost you some
brake service, what's a smile worth?
