Howdy,

I knew mentioning cutting the cabinets would draw some responses (not to
mention the less than literate, obscene one I recieved privately:).

As to the stick on convex mirrors for a dollar or so, I've got one.  It
really doesn't do the trick for me.  

And as to cutting original hard to find westie cabinets....  Well I don't
really get upset at hearing about folks who want to &quot;destroy&quot; their stuff by
modifying it to suit their tastes.  I don't really agree with lowering,
personally I think it looks silly and the saftey/accelerated wear aspects
don't appeal to me, but each his own.  

I have a hard enough time finding time to finish installing my rebuilt
engine and cleaned tranny, and all the little odds and ends that go with it.
I just want to camp and _USE_ my bus.  If I can make it more usable in an
afternoon, then why not?  If I were to build a new cabinet (which would be
the same, but with a shorter &quot;closet&quot;), besides taking forever to build (I
am slow with what little time I have).  I know me, it would not be just an
afternoon to replace the cabinet. 

So if these cabinets are so valuable (in original shape) to someone else,
then I invite that someone else to build me a replacement cabinet set.  I'll
give you __TWO__ cabinets, and a fridge/sink unit:)  Plus, believe it or
not, I am a nice guy.  I'd fill you with yummy beer and food and tell you
silly stories while you were around:)

If not, then I will modify it, and try and make it as esthetically pleasing
and usable (to myself of course) as possible.

I am not a great believe in STOCK, I am however a firm believer in fun.  I
am an engineer, if I like something, I have to modify it.  

take care,
        brandy
