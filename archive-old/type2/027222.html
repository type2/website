First time in my life, I am setting my points.

They were reading 61.5 at 950 rpm on a digital dwell/tach meter.

I opened them up.

Now they are reading 26.5 at 1320 rpm.

The Westy sound better then it ever did, running faster with just a new 
point setting.

Question:  should I leave them at 21.5 or will I have problems as soon as I 
take it on the road. (Now in the garage, waiting to hear the bad things that 
will happen at the low dwell reading....)

TIA
