Subject: Carburetor to Fuel Injection??
Date: Mon, 16 Jul 2001 13:46:54 -0400
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I searched the archives and the Library and only found small portions of
info about converting from Carburetor to Fuel injection. From some of my
previous posts, you may remember that I have a Weber progressive on my 73
westfalia. I thought about converting to Dual carbs, but with the expense of
them being around $700 I thought I would ask for your opinions about FI.
Which cost about the same. This seems to be a very good solution to the
Weber progressive not performing good in the winter. 

Anybody have experience with bolt on kits?

Where would I look for some bolt on kits?

I did read that Gary Miller makes some kits. Anybody have experience with
these?

Where else can I find info about and FI conversion?

Thanks,
Corbett
