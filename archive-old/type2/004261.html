&gt; &gt; I have a 78 Westy, 2.0 L engine w/FI. The reference to &quot;type*&quot; has me
somewhat
&gt; &gt; confused. I believe I have a type2 body style w/ a typeIV engine. Is
this
&gt; &gt; correct? What is the difference between a Type2 and TypeIV engine? This
may be
&gt; &gt; elementary to this knowledgeable list , but is confusing to me.
&gt;
&gt; it's one of the most confusing things about the bus. it's all in the
&gt; archives but to make it real simple
&gt;
&gt; ALL buses, including bays, vanagons, even the new Eurovan are type 2
&gt; (usually written arabic numbers)
&gt;
&gt; the models also have a type number but we usually ignore that here.
&gt;
&gt; in the early 70's VW introduced the TYPE 4 car into the USA and with it
&gt; came the first totally redesigned engine of the flat four made by VW.
&gt; prior to this they were improvements on the original 1930's design.
&gt;
&gt; This engine was fuel injected in the Type 4 car (411 and 412 models) when
&gt; the type 4 car sort of went bust, VW decided to put the engine into the
&gt; bus,  the engines are 1700, 1800 and 2 liter depending on the year, and in
&gt; 1977 (or was it 76?) it became fuel injected.  that engine is what we
&gt; refer to on this list as the Type IV engine (usually written in Roman
&gt; numbers)

Thanks for asking this question, Frank, I've been dying to ask it but I
thought I shouldn't because I'd probably get told off that the info is
available elsewhere. Oh, believe me, I have searched... But I haven't found.
(Why is there no Aircooled VW 4-cyl boxer FAQ?) :-)

Thanks everyone else for the explanations so far, very enlightening.

A few more things on this subject, though...

(Sorry, I haven't even got a bus yet, although my grandparents used to have
a gorgeous Taiga Gruen Westfalia (Type2/T2). I used to sleep in the hammock
over the front seats when I was a wee nipper. Fond memories. I wanna bus
like that! I'm more of a Porsche guy for now. Hey, they're air-cooled rear
engines too!)

Anyway, what is the situation pertaining to parts exchangeability between
the Type! and TypeIV engines? Are they fully compatible? Partly compatible?
Completely different in every aspect?

And how about engine/transmission exchangeability? Can you swap out
engines/transmissions without altering engine compartments etc.?

And finally... Which one's better?

TIA.
