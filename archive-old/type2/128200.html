just FYI. for those of you who haven't dealt with tirerack before - you
can in fact purchase the road hazard from them when purchasing the
tires.

this is one of the things i love about tirerack - 
they are also affiliated with thousands of tire stores/dealers around
the USA. you can even get the tires drop-shipped to a tire shop &amp; then
just drive up there to have them put on. this would certainly eliminate
the out-of-town-emergency hassle part of the equation.

also, for those of you who like to buy your tires locally, get a quote
from tirerack &amp; take it in. often they will agree to the same price!
