&gt; Can any listees recommend a couple of good parts stores in Tampa, Fl.?

Fisher Buggies is a great place to browse - huge showroom, lots of 
goodies.  On Lois Ave on the southside, near MacDill AFB off Gandy Blvd.

Other places within an hour's drive if you have time:
Sundance Bug &amp; Buggy in Plant City (off I-4) - a retail shop
Sun Ray (Corky's) in Dade City, on US 301 - retail and good-sized junkyard
Don Violett's in Auburndale (near Lakeland) - junkyard

You should be able to dig these places up in a directory.  Call ahead 
for specifics and hours.

Good luck!  While in Tampa, be sure to get some Cuban/Spanish food at 
the Columbia in Ybor City or at la Teresita near the stadium.  Tampa 
Cuban is not the same as Miami Cuban - different wave of immigrants, 
different time, different traditions.  A great seafood place is the 
Colonnade on Bayshore Blvd - great view.  For neat old drive-in 
atmosphere, get a burger at the Goody-Goody on Florida Ave downtown just 
south of the interstate.  Make sure you get the sauce. ;-)

Dang, I'm getting hungry now!
