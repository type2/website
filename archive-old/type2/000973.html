Subject: Some one tried to steal my van! (gory)
Date: Sun, 21 Feb 1999 23:26:40 -0000
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Went down to see my van in the yard &amp; found loads of blood on it! Called the
Police &amp; they said they had been called to the yard that day about a
break-in  am no less. Seams a thief was after tools &amp; opened the back of my
bus to see what he could steal. At this point I expected the blood to be the
polices, but no!
 I have packed the back full of new panels &amp; could not fit the belly-pan in
when I removed the heater, so being a high-top I stood it up in the back
tight to the door, warned my mechanic etc. &amp; left.
Last night it rained hard &amp; it always makes a puddle under my bus :( , in
order to straddle the puddle &amp; look in the back of my van the &quot;perp&quot; held on
to the bumper with one hand &amp; opened the door with the other. The resulting
blood was when the belly-pan slid out of the back &amp; did a &quot;Madam giloteen&quot;
on his middle &amp; index fingers!
 GOOD! the police caught him (followed the blood to a bar round the block) &amp;
he's now arrested, but in our local hospital. They can't sew the fingers
back coz there a bit grubby!

Maybe I'll visit &amp; give him some Bananas. That'd be a challenge.

 Sorry to gloat, but I have NO sympathy for thieves. Every-one with a right
to open my van _at_ the yard was warned about the junk in the back &amp; the keys
were locked in the safe with all the others. I'd be more concerned if this
was the US &amp; not the UK, there I'd probably get my ass sued off!

Peace
