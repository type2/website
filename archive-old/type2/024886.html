Subject: RE: [T2] Bus Depot

Why? I actually think reading about other's experience with suppliers is one
of the most useful things I have seen on your list.  Sure beats reading
conflicting mechanical fixes or that someone bought a welder.  But don't
worry, list Nazi - I am unsubscribing.

&gt;Yes.  Don't order anything online. They list lots of items. However, in
&gt;almost every case when I have placed an order a Bus Depot employee calls to
&gt;tell me half the item is out of stock.  I have had several items on
&gt;back-order for months.  I have had much better luck with Bus Boys (they got
&gt;a rebuilt '68 bus steering bos to my mechanic in one day - they are in
&gt;Calif.  we are in Maryland).  Rocky Mountain is also very prompt.
