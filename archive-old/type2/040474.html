LIST: I am trying this again.  If you get it twice, I apologize, but I have
not been able to send messages to the list in months.  They all disappear
into the ether.  Neither can I get a list admin to answer my pleas for help.

&gt;After I get my two girls down to bed I plan to try and get the '66s

&gt;oil, new spark plugs and wires, and a full tune up.  Am I missing
&gt;anything?  Does anyone have any tips for this glorious event?  Thanks


One thing-  I started up an engine that had sat for 5-9 years, it ran fine
until I put it under load.  At which point I dropped a valve (old, brittle).
I cracked the case to find a crankcase filled with 1&quot; of solidified sludge.
Yow!

I did change the oil, but did not pay close attention.  When you change the
oil, run a finger or small screwdriver in around the lip of the oil screen
location.  Search for solids.  If you find ANY, I would tear the engine down
and rebiuld before even one start.  I learned my lesson very quickly.  (like
6 blocks)

I would also get a friend with a large truck (tow vehicle) to follow you on
a nice country drive if you decide to start and drive it.  You never know
what awaits after decades of neglect...

Good Luck,
