Subject: New paint (very long)

Hello:

I attended the local chapter of CORSA tonight, and the guest speakers 
were from the local paint store. I’ve done business with API ever since 
I was painting school busses 25 years ago. 

1971 to 1973 I earned a degree in auto body and paint at our local 
community college. I worked my way through by working in body shops as a 
painter’s apprentice (another term for slave). My last painting job (for 
pay) was pre-80. I painted my last vehicle about 7 years ago. Tonight I 
learned I no longer know anything about auto paint. EVERYTHING has 
changed in the last 5 years.

I own a Binks suction feed gun that works at pressures of 60 to 80 lbs. 
Now guns use 18 lbs, and have a nozzle pressure of no greater than 10 
lbs (this cuts down on overspray). The new guns cost $450 and up! 

Paint has changed. The new primers and paints are catalized (epoxy 
based). This was around when I was painting, so that’s not completely 
new. The difference is the new paints are BETTER than the factory paint 
jobs. Unfortunately, you need to use an air-feed mask to spray them 
safely.

Clear overcoats used to be something you put only on custom (candy apple 
or pearlessence) finishes. Later it became a necessity, as more cars 
came with them stock. Back then, clears tended to yellow, flake or fail 
prematurely, and chipping was always a problem. They were to be avoided 
if at all possible, unless you planned on keeping the car in the garage 
when it wasn’t actually being driven. These finishes were known to be 
brittle.

Now clear finishes are BETTER than the paint underneath. I was amazed 
that they recommend them over solid color paints. This surprised and 
delighted me. You can get a much better looking paint job with this 
clear coat.

Another surprise was in the primers. You no longer need to etch bare 
metal before priming it. (There was a special etching solution, a mild 
acid, that you’d rub over bare metal to provide an additional ‘grip’). 
Now the basic primer has an etching solution that you add. Another type 
of primer and sealer is available that is catalized. The advantage to 
these products is that, once dry, they won’t rewet. In the past, this 
has always been a problem. You do your body work, and sand the filler 
with 80 grit paper. After this, you’d apply a primer surfacer to fill 
the minor imperfections. When this was sanded smooth, you’d apply a 
sealer, then your color. The main problem is that the subsurfaces would 
reabsorb some of the thinner from the later coats. It would swell up 
where it was thickest. When everything dried, “scratches” could show 
through the final surface. The only recourse was to wet sand with 600 
grit and buff out the imperfections. This will not occur with the epoxy 
primers, since they don’t rewet.

The real shocker for me was in large part due to CA laws. The older 
finishes contained large portions of volatile materials. In a gallon of 
primer, about 7.5 lbs of the “paint” would evaporate into the air. CA 
passed very strict laws. Now paint is available in other states that 
only 4 lbs will flash off. They have improved the CA standards paints so 
they are better than those sold elsewhere... and only 2 lbs will flash 
off from these finishes. The net result is that more “paint” stays on 
the surface, less evaporating, which means it will dry smoother and 
stonger.

The only down side is the expense. I painted the bottom of my 73 van for 
$125 in materials 10 years ago. They said that the cost of finishing a 
small car (a Corvair was used as an example, since this was a CORSA 
meeting) would be in the neighborhood of $500. This included all 
materials, including sand paper.

BTW, they recommend staying away from any rust conversion products, if 
you can get in there with a wire brush. It's better to remove it, than 
to treat it. They said that removing it was 100%, but treating the rust 
would, probably, just slow the rust down... and it could reappear in 
later life.

I appologize to those I've given painting advice to, if it's misdirected 
anyone. I tried to include statements each time, saying to check with 
your local paint stores. I'm sure the advice I gave would still hold 
true for the products I used to use (these products are still available 
and still viable). For the best possible finish, use the latest in 
finishes.

It's great to know you can now put on a finish that is BETTER than VW 
put on their cars.
