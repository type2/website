Subject: Reverse polarity charging

&gt; T J  my lead-acid accumulator man
&gt;     Can you comment on this advice from a VW enthusiast email list?
&gt;  
&gt;     One thing to try (last resort before you dump them): charge them with
&gt; reversed polarity and then chrage them again with proper polarity.  Not sure
&gt; what the physics/chemistry behind this is - but it is supposed to bring back
&gt; a dead battery or totally kill it ...
&gt; 
&gt; I have learnt this from a guy with lots of practical experience.  Did not
&gt; work on my 6V car battery though ....

Anyone else confirm this?

I googled it and every ref is that you'll damage your charger if you do
so, and most chargers have reverse polarity safeguards.  No word on what
it might do bad to the battery... But I only looked at 5 pgs or so of
results...

I would imagine it would make a diff whether or not the battery had a
charge on it to begin with, but then that would imply that must drain
it, charge it reversed, drain it and then charge properly.

I dunno.  Sounds like a recipe for letting the smoke out...

;-)
