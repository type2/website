Subject: Re: dealing with torn ball joint boots
References: &lt;B774BA2D.10AE%BusBarn_at_prodigy_dot_net&gt; &lt;3B4FEA63.1B61F931_at_home_dot_com&gt; &lt;006201c10ccb$ea119600$0200a8c0_at_bigho&gt;

Since I've go 80,000 mi on my torn boot(s) I can speak with some
authority:
Dirt and lack of grease/water getting in there will ruin your ball
joint.  On a cross-country trip back in'76, We heard CREAKING while
doing turning on out 71 Westy and realized a ball joint boot was ripped
up and driving in a pounding rain for many hours at high speed likely
washed out the grease and let water in.  I got it functioning with a
needle grease gun tip, but that joint needed eventual replacing- it got
clunky.  Having learned my lesson, I keep good visual inspections on my
high milage 78 Westy, and when I noticed torn upper ball joint boots, I
first cleaned all around it, filled the tear with grease, wrapped it
with plastic (grocery story bag) so the upper part of the joint was all
covered, and then covered that with stretch tape.  That was over 80,000
mi ago- and I just redid it because I had to have the front alighed. 
This time I drilled tiny 1/16&quot; holes in the top caps, and got the grease
in that way.  MB
