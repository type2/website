&gt; Hi Glenn,

&gt; A very quick number-crunching tells me that one motor per rear wheel

Electric horsepower is rated very differently than gasoline horsepower.

Since electric motors deliver full torque from zero RPM and have a
relatively flat torque/rpm curve, you don't need as high a horesepower
rating as you do with gasoline.
