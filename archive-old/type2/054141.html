&gt; The time has come for me to do the right thing and tear our the
&gt; converted 77 FI engine and replace it with a 72 engine. I have been
&gt; looking around for awhile and have found a 72 squareback, smashed up
&gt; with a great engine. So, is engine identical to the 72 engines inType
&gt; IIs? They are both TypeIV engines, right?

IIRC, Squarebacks are in Type 3--which has a modified T1 engine in it.
Totally different animal.
