Monday, April 12th.  Time to drag my butt up outta bed and get rollin'.
First I gotta take care of the lawn before I leave... a quick trip to the
hardware store for weed-whacker chord, nuts 'n bolts for the heat exchanger
arms, and citronella oil for the tiki torches.  I made quick work out of the
lawn, got some gear together for the trip, and loaded a few things on the
roof-rack for show... including my new acquired metal cooler ;-) At the last
minute, friend and fellow Missouri Micro, Shannon offered to house-sit while
I was gone, so no need to drag Teddy the Amazing No-Brains Wonder Dog along
with me on the trip!  Did some  grocery shopping to prevent having to eat
out all over the road ( I gotta keep my costs to a minimum ya know!), and
when that was all said and done it was time for some tinkering on the bus.

I did a complete tune-up and valve adjustment, checked timing, etc. and went
over everything I could possibly think of, and went over it all again.  I
took the bus for a spin out on the highway, but it STILL was running hot and
had hardly any power.  That was when I made the decision to 1st post to the
list about my problems before I left.  It was pretty late by then, and by
morning I had only a few responses, and those were of things I had already
checked.  I decided leave anyway, take it easy on the road, and troubleshoot
as I went along.

1st stop of the morning was at Archway Imports, the local VW supply house.
Grabbed me a few extra alternator belts, just in case, and an assortment of
main jets on the suggestion of the counter-jockeys there.  I was on the road
by about noonish.

At the first rest stop, I decided I could be running a little lean from the
looks of the spark plugs, so I tried the smallest of the over-sized main
jets I had..it was marked a '035'.  At first, I thought it had helped, if
not cured my problem... I had quite a bit more power, and the heads seemed
to run cooler. Well, eventually they heated back up to the 500 degree range,
and power began to sag off.  The second rest stop I came to I installed the
jet marked '040'.. again with identical results...  at least I was making
SOME progress though, and my heads were running down in the low 500's to
high 400's range.  I hope the power would hold out though.. the foothills of
Tennessee were quickly approaching.

At this time I was headed down on I-57 south in southern Illinois.  Probably
the crappiest bit if interstate I've ever driven on.  All the little cracks
and pot-holes are marked with spray paint like they're getting ready to fix
them, but don't let that fool you folks, it's been that way for at least 3
years now.  My 1st gas stop was in Carbondale, Ill.  I was getting only
about 16mpg..  ARRGHH!!!  That's worse than a damned F*RD!!!  And get this,
the plugs STILL looked like I was running lean!  The flavor of the exhaust
and the color of the tail-pipe told a different story though, so what the
heck was goin' on here!!??

I limped on into the night, and by the time I reached Nashville, I was deep
in to the night... running VERY late too.  I wanted to be in Madison AL, by
dinner time.  The condition of the bus was successfully turning a 5-hour
drive into a 10-hour white knuckled adventure.  One of the tensest moments
occurred when I heard over the CB radio on channel 19: &quot;thars a V-dub-ya van
over the hill har...  Watchem...  WATCH EM!!!!!&quot;  and then suddenly...
VVRROOOOOSSSHHHHHH!!!!!  A GIGANTIC tractor-trailer combo sped by me, doing
about 80mph going down this hill... Dern thing nearly blew me clear off the
road!  I was almost completely blown onto the shoulder of the highway by its
wake.  The was one sphincter-puckering moment if there ever was one!  A few
choice words were uttered over the CB about my driving habits, but I let
them go without comment... I was on vacation dammit!  This is cathartic!
Lol

About 10:30 I pulled off the interstate in Alabama, onto the road that would
take me into Madison.  However, once again I had forgotten my more detailed
directions, the ones that would guide me to my mom's house from the
interstate.  I remembered a few landmarks though, and decided to have a go
at it.  I remembered to take a right turn at a BP gas station, and that her
street would be on the right hand side, soon after a high-school.  Well, I
turned at the BP and went down this road for miles.. never saw a school,
never saw her street.  A few runs at it, and I gave up.  I went back to the
BP and called my mom.  She said she would be up to the BP in five minutes or
so, and would guide me to the house.  Well, I waited... and waited, and
waited.. about 40 minutes went by.  No sign of Mom.  I went into the gas
station and asked if there was another BP further down the road, but the
Iranian ( Iranians in Alabama?  What's next? Grits and Gizzards in Iran?)
attendant didn't know.. one of the local boys said though that there WAS
another one about 10 miles down the road 'apiece'.

I sped off (well, as much as a tired old bus can anyway) for the elusive 2nd
BP Gas station.  I found it, closed and dark, made my turn, saw the
High-School, but darn it if I STILL couldn't find my mom's street!   Go back
to the BP, call mom again...  confirmed that I was at the CORRECT BP this
time, and she drove up there again.  Minutes later I was pulling up in the
driveway of my mom's and step-fathers new house...  mansion is more like it.

They were re-located by the Government for my step-fathers (Roger) job with
Sikorsky.  He used to work at the building here in St. Louis, but that
facility was moved down to the Red Stone Arsenal in Huntsville.  He also had
this idea to retire, and go into business for himself building an entire
Victorian Gas-Light neighborhood...  Complete with horse-trail and giant
public square in the center of the neighborhood. Well, that's still in the
planning stages, but for now they're living in this hoity-toity 'rich
southern' 'hood, complete with militant neighborhood association and all.
The kinda place that would have the villagers storming the house with lit
torches at the 1st sign of my rusty old 54 singe-cab.  At he moment though,
Roger was out in Las Vegas, helping one of his sons build a few houses out
there.  Fine by me, since we're not exactly on the best of terms...

This place was a sight! All the appointments... 10' high ceilings, fancy
southern fixtures, hardwood floors... grand staircase, 5 bedrooms, Jacuzzi
bath-tub..  the works! Nice big garage too ;-)   It was about 11:00PM by the
time I got there though, and my 2 sisters Gwen and Rachel had already gone
to bed...  Mom saved me a plate from dinner though, and I sat and ate while
we talked and caught up a little. Their dog was going ape-shit though..
Whenever I visit, she goes crazy with excitement, pees on the floor, whines
constantly, etc.

I was set up in the guest bedroom for the night, and Dusty the dog sat
outside the door and whimpered all night  ;-)

I didn't awake until about 9AM the next day, when the exterminator got there
and I HAD to get up.  It was the 1st night of normal human rest I'd had in
more than 2 weeks.  I was starting to feel better already.

-Brian..  Next time:  Space camp and the Rocket Center!  And bus sightings
galore!
