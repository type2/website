Subject: Thanks For the Fuel Injection....

Thanks to all of you who sent me small kicks in the a$$. I should just get 
on with it and get it done. It is almost 5:00 PM here and time to go home 
and get to the real work. I hope to get the FI system up and running by this 
weekend. Keep you posted. I picked up a couple of Hydraulic engines 2.0L 
over this weekend in trade for a '66 Bus Carcus. Soon I will be able to get 
rid of the 1.8L GEX that the PO replaced the 2.0L with. Anyway thanks again 
got to go pick up my bucket of Hydro Seal Concentrate from the store before 
it closes.

TravelOn,
