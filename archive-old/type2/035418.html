Subject: heat smells like exhaust

The heater in my 71 bus puts out a good stream of hot air at speeds
above 40 mph or so, and I use it on the freeway. On city streets
where I have to decelerate, I smell exhaust fumes in the heater air.
What is the most likely cause of the fumes? 

As I understand it, the fresh air flows through the engine compartment,
through the fan, where it is pushed out the heater hoses into the heater
boxes (heat exchangers), then through the ductwork up to the vents on
the dash board and elsewhere in the cabin. If there is an exhaust leak 
somewhere in the engine compartment, those gases would get sucked into 
the fan along with the fresh air.

The seal around the engine door is a good one, as is the seal around the
back of the engine by the pulley. The front seal has some problems, but 
it seems to me that the front of the engine is the least likely place for 
exhaust gases to collect. Is it more likely that there is a manifold
problem?
