My bus had a case of the hard start blues when I first bought it.  It was
mild at first, then got really bad over the course of a few years.  During
the bad years,  I scrubbed, cleaned, and polished every ignition wire
terminal on a regular basis.  I also replaced just about every single part
in the ignition circuit: battery, ignition switch, fuses, alternator,
battery cables, etc.  But many a cold rainy night I'd still have to lay
under the bus to short the terminals to get the thing running.  One day I
was bored so I pulled the starter out and replaced the solenoid with a used
solenoid I had laying around.  This was the cure!  It finally started every
time, no matter what the conditions were outside.  Well, my bus was cured
for about 3 years anyway.  This summer the hard start blues came back.  Just
a light case though, on really hot days after a freeway run.  If it gets
worse I'll probably try a brand new solenoid.  If that don't work I'll admit
defeat and install a relay.

&gt; Occasionally, when I turn the key, the starter does absolutely nothing.
&gt; So I either have to push start it or short the terminals on the starter
&gt; with a screwdriver.  Is this something that can be circumvented with the
&gt; Hard Start Relay, or does it sound like my starter has a dead spot?
