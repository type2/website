Subject: Re: [T2] Re;Heating possiblities

I have not tried this,but checked it out on another van. The owner had a marine
shop make him a divider out of heavy duty clear
plastic.It hangs just behind both front seats. It uses velcro around the edges
and makes the front area more like a cab. It heats up pretty quick now. I also
think he block off the back vents. I had a picture of it somewhere. If I find it
I'll post it.
