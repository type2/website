Subject: Re: [T2] Man, Bus doesn't run again...

Todd,

On my previous Bus I had to reach under the ignition switch and push the wires
towards the passenger side to get the starter to engage. If it works you'll
probably need a new switch at some point, though I drove mine for about 4-5
years like that before I sold it.

Doug,
