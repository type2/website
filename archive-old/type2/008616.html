Subject: Re: Parts Manual Repo's and the dreaded

&gt;(-}  I rather doubt that VW is ever going to republish their parts manuals
&gt;for pre 80's vehicles or care to waste the time/money if they still own the
&gt; copyright and find out someone is copying the manuals.  Now to make

Being a pessimist at heart, I tend to agree with Mike that the odds aren't
in favor of it happening.  However, if there is real money to be made it
could happen.  Robert Bentley publishers has rights to publish the factory
VW manuals.  According to a new edition of one of the VW rags (forget
which), it was the influence of one of the editors of the magazine that
convinced Bentley to reissue the early beetle service manual (which has been
out of print for 40 years).  Bentley agreed, but needed an excellent
condition original copy to use as a master!  The editor dug one up and the
Official Service Manual covering the 1952 Beetle lives again (see
HTTP://WWW.RB.COM/volkswag/v157/v157.htm).

I can see where the early Beetle service manual would be a good seller.
People are spending big bucks to restore the early models and there is
demand for factory reference material.  I'm not sure if Bentley has or could
get VW's permission to reprint parts manuals, but with enough voices
inquiring who knows what could happen?  I've been procrastinating contacting
Bentley to print a manual that covers all models of gasoline heaters
installed in aircooled VWs.  I'm not even convinced that would be much of a
seller though (especially considering parts for the old heaters are obsolete
and there is no aftermarket for them!).  But if Bentley indeed has the right
to reissue all VW service manuals, it is at least within the realm of
possibility (the gas heater info is in volume F of the factory service
manual entitled &quot;Fresh Air Heating&quot;).  

Inquiries to Bentley (http://www.rb_dot_com/) regarding the parts manuals might
allude to recent Ebay transactions that surely attest to demand and the
price folks are willing to pay. A talk with the editor of the VW magazine
for his contact at Bentley might also be a good strategy.  A mass of
individual inquiries rather than a petition would be more persuasive.
