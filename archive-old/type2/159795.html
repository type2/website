it sure sounds plausible, but I will say that I visually inspected the 
passages of the carb as well as the manifold. When I had the manifolds 
off the head to replace the gasket I also inspected (as well as I could) 
the head for any obstructions. I will say that it sounds a lot like 
something like that, however I was unable to find anything.
