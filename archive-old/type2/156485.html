Subject: Re: [T2] tubing to carry away exhaust gases

&gt; Can anyone recommend a product to slip over the

The only hot part will be right at the connection, as
I see it. If you use something oversized with a
collar/ spacer between ex pipe and hose that will
allow air to be sucked in around the pipe... hose to a
box with a sacrificial fan in it... shroud the fan so
it's more efficient and if you don't want that fan
outside, another short length of hose to get outside.

I wonder if there is enough fuel in the exhaust to
make this dangerous? Perhaps one of the bilge blowers
from West Marine that some of us have used to boost
heaters
placed inline in the hose? Kinda noisey.

Just some scatter-brained thoughts - BaH
