One more thing, and it is bad news. I suggest you get over the idea that 
this bus will be ready for a road trip in three weeks, regardless of the 
condition it is in. Allow a minimum of six months to get the engine and 
other mechanicals up to spec, troubleshoot any inevitable problems, learn 
how to keep engine temps down, allow for breaking-in, if needed, and so 
on. Ask me how I know.

It also takes about six months to read through the list archives and 
learn what you need to know in order to keep a bus running right. But I 
can give you the one-minute version. You cannot get a reliable bus simply 
by throwing money at it (although money helps). There are a lot of shoddy 
parts and a few shady dealers out there, and they will gladly sell you 
parts with which you can quickly destroy your engine, or they will save 
you time and sell you an engine that will destroy itself in no time 
(read: GEX).

I am sending this bit of advice out to the list. If anyone thinks that I 
am being too conservative in my advice, speak up.
