Subject: Need Cooling tin Cover for 79 Westy

Help - 79 Westy I bought doesn't have left tin cooling cover (looking from 
back of vehicle) - the flat piece that bolts from exhaust over to engine and 
covers the push rods.  I'm making one out of one of my wife's cookie sheets 
but would like to find an original - not a stock item at Bus Depot, etc. and 
no VWs located in local junkyards.
