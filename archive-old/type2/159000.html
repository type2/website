Subject: Re: [T2] windshield replacement...

Hi

I seem to remember mine was tight when I did it last year.

Good point (wifes ides) put 2 pieces of cord arounf the seal, one ending 
at the top and one at the bottom, gives more control.

Bad point, don't let your brother press the bottob tight hand corner (no 
matter how gently) when putting it in, as it will crack.  Mine has a 
lovely crack accross the right hand corner (but only the inner sheet of 
glass?, and this was (is?) an electric heated screen.  However passed 
the vehicle test last week, even withe crack so Yippee.
