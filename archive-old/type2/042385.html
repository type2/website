Subject: Re: Pressure Plate

David &amp; Anna Wolf sends:

&gt; I'm not so sure about the warping of the pressure plate either, maybe it
&gt; could. My experience has shown that it is so so easy to strip the bolts. The
&gt; metal in the pressure plate and the bolts is so soft that much more than 18 FP
&gt; will strip them for sure.

Clutches heat in use, and if you have different amounts of pressure around
the plate, you'll get different expansion/contraction.

I can see worrying about the bolts, but they screw into the flywheel (one of
the hardest pieces of metal in the whole car) so the female threads aren't
such a worry.
