Subject: Re: [T2] looking for T2-microfiches

Hi,

I do not know if the owners of www.type2_dot_com want to expose 
themselves by publishing the 1968 to 1972 Type 2  parts manual. 
However, there is a precedent for a similar Internet publication of 
VW parts manuals. Perhaps you are already familiar with

http://wow.atlasta_dot_net/~mriluvu/oacdp/

home of the Obsolete Air-Cooled Documentation Project. Among other 
&quot;air-cool &quot; stuff it hosts the 1958-1967 Type 2 parts reference which 
is huge. I suppose I could offer it up to the them if they are 
interested. I also have a 1968 to 1972 Westfalia/VW Campmobile parts 
reference for North American delivery units which is also quite 
interesting and useful.

I do not recall the URL but for a while, someone in the UK had the 
Type2 microfiche on line.



Thanks
Chris

&gt;Perhaps you could get the Type2 website to post copies of these for 
&gt;all to see?  They would probably have to have the VW symbol removed 
&gt;though...
