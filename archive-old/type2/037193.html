Subject: Re: Key Blank Source

&gt;  &gt; &gt;I've searched the library, archives and net for an NOS or repro key for
&gt;  &gt; &gt;my bus, but can't find one.  I think WWest and RMMW carry them, but not
&gt;  &gt; &gt;the L-profile.
&gt;
&gt;I got 2 steel key blanks for my 73 Westy from RMMW about a year ago.  That was
&gt;the easy part.  The harder part was finding a locksmith who would 
&gt;cut 'em, since
&gt;they're steel.  I went to three places before I found a guy who was willing to
&gt;do it, but I think he was regretful afterwards.
&gt;
&gt;Oh, and if you can, get the original key code to have a brand new key made.  I
&gt;did this and it made a big difference in how easy the key was to 
&gt;use, especially
&gt;on the ignition.

When I picked up my van last year the PO had a broken original key 
that would not work, but it had the key numbers. The replacement keys 
were temperamental, wouldn't work in all of the locks and such. I 
took the original  to a locksmith that I had worked with before and 
he cut me new one using the code. It costs more to have the keys cut 
that way, I think it was $6.00, but then copies made from it usually 
work with no problem and this has been the case.

Commercial Lock and Key on Miramar Rd for those living in the San Diego Area

I find that the locksmiths and commercial lock shops to do better 
work than say the hardware store or the key cutting kiosks at the 
mall. Also cheaper, by about 30 percent, for key cutting.
