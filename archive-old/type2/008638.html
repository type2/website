&gt; I've got a set on mine. I've been told they are worth a nice chunk of
&gt; change. Apparently they are dealer items, and there are still dealer
tags on
&gt; mine. Never seen any for sale, although most people who see mine
want some
&gt; for their bus.
&gt; 
&gt; Here's a picture:  http://www.insync_dot_net/~kittman/images/0211_007.jpg
&gt; 
&gt; BTW I can't imagine NOT having these. They hold ALOT of our junk,
keeping
&gt; the dash free of crap. They are nice and durable too. This picture
must have
&gt; been taking on a good day, when they were empty!

I have a set of homebrew parcel trays, and I agree that they are
highly useful.  I've never seen a set of factory trays and my trays
are similar is size and shape to the factory setup.  The open mesh is
nice too, probably better than my Masonite units.
