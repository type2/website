Subject: intro Friday msg from New Zealand

Greetings BayWindowers
	May I jump in with a 'late Friday' msg to introduce my perspective?
	My first (1964-68) 4-wheel motor vehicle, a 36 bhp 1200 cc 
1957 VW microbus, was  an 'impotent gasser', and the front drum 
brakes were inadequate.  I was among the first Berkeley enthusiasts 
to lash a strip of aluminium the width of a hand down the rear of the 
flush air-intake louvres, with salutory improvement of cooling at 
speed.  And no, I'm not on the wrong list but only tracing my 
background wrt VW.  The Westphalia 1600 camper I bought new in 1969 
had adequate power -  50 bhp  -  and by then the factory had imitated 
us hippies with air-intake scoops - but still the inferior brakes.
	I've just bought in a lo-rust part of our other main island a 
1973 1600cc pop-top campmobile which immediately took us 1255 mi 
home, cruising at the 62-mph speed limit on the flat, consuming 3 
litre oil (within new specs) and 26 mpg (Imp).  The owner's brochure 
states in the immortal VW-style  Maximum and cruising speed 68 mph 
(110 km/h)  but this one is good for 71-74 mph.  A good VW mechanic 
who had serviced it said it had hi-comp heads.  Max speed 85 mph in 
maori overdrive down a long steep hill (yes that's similar to mexican 
OD and a few others that might get me in trouble ...  ;-).
	I'm generally thrilled with the 'new' vehicle.   VW took till 
'73 to admit Renault had been right in 1965 slapping an alternator on 
the R16; with the disc front brakes we now have the peak development 
of the air-cooled 4.  I dare say some will try to convince me the 
type4 motor would be better  ...
	The seats are better at 33 y than the EZ-collapse Jap crap in 
my 13-y-old Nissan vanette.
	The Devon conversion is good furniture  -  and all removable 
within 15 min if empty kombi reqd e.g for carrying motorbikes.

	I doubt I'll slap on a Judson as we used to dream of in the 
late 1960s. Water injection will be pursued first.  The 'type 2' 
archives don't seem to hold many answers for how to do this along the 
lines of my article on my webpage.  I fail to understand how inlet 
vacuum can be used to achieve not only retard but also advance; more 
to the point, I'm not sure where to slap in the water in my 'W' carb 
which appears to have only vac retard.  Has anyone worked out these 
puzzles so I don't have to?
