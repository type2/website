Importance: Normal
Subject: Pop-top refinishing

In a thread from a couple years ago, a guy on the Vanagon list named
Beckett highly recommended this product for easy refinishing of
fiberglass tops:

Sherwin Williams Industrial and Marine Coatings: Industrial Enamel, Pure
White(B54 W 101)

I have contacted the S-W rep in San Diego and he tells me his computer
says it is not available at any California stores, and he only sees it
in Hawaii and the Pacific Northwest. Says it may be that it isn't
approved by the state for inductrial applications.

Here's a quote from Beckett:

&quot;Wash the top, and let it dry. Trim off any &quot;hairs&quot; and rough sand with
anything, including gravel, or a cinder block. If the top is not totally
buggered, don't even bother. This stuff was designed to fill rough
spots. Apply two rolled on coats of the above.( use a three inch roller,
with the shortest nap you can find. Or, if you're of the mind to, a
Binks 18 gun, or airless sprayer also works extreamly well.)  Let dry
two to three hours between coats. Then apply one final brushed on coat.
This product will out last the vehicle, is a wonderfull semi-gloss
white, and is almost bullet-proof. Everything,including bird droppings,
eggs, tree sap, or anything your children (in my case, grandchildren)
can evacuate from their bodies, etc. can be washed or scraped off w/o
hurting the finish. If, somehow, you manage to damage the coating, just
brush on a dab touch-up paint to the area. It will blend right in. I've
used this stuff for over ten years, on three Westys, and will personally
pay for your gallon of paint( 29.95 plus tax) if you don't absolutly
love it. Go on, try it!&quot;

If anyone knows of anything else that works this well and is as easy to
apply, I sure would like to get some.
Thanks,
