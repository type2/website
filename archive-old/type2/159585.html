Subject: Re: [T2] holidays, wish lists

That would have been *very* helpful for my wedding last month!
:)
I actually looked for such a place, and I think there is one site out west
that does, but overall you're better off just putting together a detailed
list yourself, with sources...

&gt; Do any of the online vendors have a wish list or registry feature? My
&gt; family
&gt; wants to get 'involved' in the resto (without getting dirty hands and such
&gt; LOL), and purchase parts for holiday gifts - but they want to make sure I
&gt; get the right parts. Neat idea.
