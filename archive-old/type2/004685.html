Hi Mark


OK, this may not help as I have no idea what is special about the 72, but I
presume you have done the adjustment at the front end of the cables and also
correctly adjusted the shoes? To adjust the shoes you may need some help
from somebody up front to press the brake to help the shoes centralise as
you turn the star wheels.

Also have you got the right cables. I fitted some new cables to my 79 and
had endless problems with brakes sticking on until I realised I'd been
supplied with the wrong ones. The problem was that the return springs were
too short and because of this the brakes were sticking on and I was
adjusting them wrongly. When I thought I had them right, and drove off, they
would then unstick themselves and because the adjustment was actually way
off the drum the e-brake wouldn't bind properly. I coudn't hold it on hills
and had a rear scare going up the gangway onto a car ferry.

Is it possible that the guides into the rear backing plates have come off or
are damaged?

Failing this take the drums off and get somebody to work the lever in the
cab and see what happens.

Good luck

Andy Vevers
