Very good idea Ted.  Another that belongs in the &quot;How to Make Your VW Last
Forever&quot; list.  Anti-seize and LPS-3 are part of my religion.  An ounce of
prevention negates a lot of pounding and language becomes more moderate as
well.

Exactly what I was goin' to say.  I also put a VERY thin film of anti-seize
on the hub where it touches the drum so that next time it will come off
easier.  Not too much as you don't want it melting onto your drum or shoes
(lubricated brakes don't stop a bus very well).
Have Fun,
Ted
