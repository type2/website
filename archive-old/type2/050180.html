I was at a VW PRA Drag Race at the LA County raceway last September. Parked
in the pits with Itch all opened up for folks to ogle. When we left, I got
maybe 1/2 mile down the highway before I noticed how sluggish Itch was. Got
to 60mph, though. And, there wasn't anybody on the highway to witness it! So
don't tell anyone.
