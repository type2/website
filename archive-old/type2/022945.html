Hi,

I am new to the list. The reason a joined is because my ´82 FI Pickup is 
not working properly, thought you guys might have some pointers for me.

It started with that the bus misfired and was hard to start, then it died 
completly. After a lot of testing we came to the concluesion that it was 
the doublerelay. The relay was changed and the bus started and ran really 
great, better than it ever has. I used it to move some stuff for a hole 
day. Just as I was returning home, I heard a &quot;clinking&quot; noise. The engine 
ran fine and I coudln´t find any fault with it but when I drove it it 
&quot;clinked&quot; a lot. I drove the bus to my garage and on the road it started to 
misfire again, I put it in my garage and didn´t have time to look at it 
more that night. I returned a day later and tried to start it, dead.

What can cause this, is something destroying my doublerelay? Can it be the 
hole computerbox? Does any body have any Idea??

My best regards,
Nils Johnn, Sweden
