Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Horn Button won't come off?

I find that the best &quot;trick&quot; for removing horn buttons is:

1) Take a utility knife blade and pop it between the metal and plastic.
Pry up a hair, you just want enough of a gap for step2.

2) insert a 1&quot; stiff putty knife in the gap and pry up.

Sometimes it takes a fair amount of force to remove the button.  You can
do it with the utility knife blade, but I have chipped the edge of the
button and (tho I might have chipped it anyway with the putty knife, they
get pretty brittle after 30 years :-( and you have much less lever arm.
