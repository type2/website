&gt;&gt; I'm not sure of the &quot;official&quot; origin of the GD bears, but suspect that
&gt;&gt; whoever started them &quot;borrowed&quot; the original bear. One of the dancing

&gt;I have wondered at this similarity for years. At the risk of getting even
&gt;further afield of our topic, can anyone tell us if the Bear Alignment logo
&gt;predates Mr. Owsley's bear (circa '1966?)?

I'm sure it is because I remember the yellow Bear Alignment signs in front
of several service stations in the neighborhood, and always thought he was
a fine looking Bear.
