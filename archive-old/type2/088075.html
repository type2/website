Subject: Re: [T2] I'm sorry

Well Mike, if you didnt mean to come across as whiney and bitchy, you
failed. It had all the subtlety of a lot of recent ads and posts that cry
waaa, you had your chance, now see what you made me do. What makes anybody
think that the rest of us owes them. Offering things to the list has
traditionally been a cool thing to do &quot;I'm giving list members first and/or
a cheaper price&quot; etc.

 &gt;  just forward my emails to you to handle.  I chose this forum to
advertise

Nowhere in the type 2 or vintage charters does it mention selling, selling
and venders have traditionally been done at the graciousness of the list.
This may come as a suprize to some people, but when you offer something for
sale on any venue you'll get all kinds of responces, at least on a computor
you can let your delete key be your friend. Calling people stupid 'cause
they dont buy what you want or at the price you want or when you want, is
just kinda like, well stupid.

&gt;  apologies to the list.  Chris can go pound sand.

as Chris said the first time, just plain rude, and whats with the xenophobic
swipe at Canada? Do we make sure to mention the crack head in Atlanta who
wants us to ship his free part overnight express and by the way can we pay
for it too, 'cause he like really needs it for this like killer party this
weekend and his mom wont drive him?

Ok rant mode off, flame suit on
Sorry guys, but if your going to offer something for sale, you gotta take
the good with the bad and its just not our fault.
