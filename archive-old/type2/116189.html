Subject: Dual Carb setup...

Hey guys,

	I've decided I'm going to try to hook up the dual carburetors I have
for my Volkswagen Bus.

They are a set of single barrel carburetors. One for each side. They are
Webbers. It seems right now, the only items I am missing are a crossover
pipe (just a tube to connect the two intake pieces to help equalize the
vacuum) and the dual throttle linkage. 

I was wondering if anyone had something that I could use, or maybe even the
dual throttle linkage for these carburetors already.
I ASSUME (until I get my Bentley manual in the mail), that what I'll have to
do is attach some sort of adjustment clamp to the end of the existing
throttle cable I have now, and attach the throttle linkage from both the
other two carburetors to that, correct?

Any help would be appreciated...


Thanks,
