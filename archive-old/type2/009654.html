Michele woke me up a 5:30 AM and informed me that she was having
contractions. We gathered the appropriate items and packed the '69 for the
short trip to the hospital. By the time we left the contractions had Michele
doubled over in pain. The bus fired on the first turn of the key and we
pulled outta the driveway at 6:00 AM. The oil light came on as we rounded
the first turn to leave the nieghborhood. Occasionly there is a quick flash
the occurs at that turn when the bus is cold. This time it stayed on. No
time to stop with Michele huffing thru another contraction. I played my
hunch that it was electrical and wiggled the turn signal arm. Red light out.
Phew!!!!! 

Franklin Thomas Cybulski was born at 11:40 AM on Tuesday June 1st. He

forward to Franks first bus ride on Thursday:)&gt;
