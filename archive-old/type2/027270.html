Greetings Listers:

I just installed new heat exchangers on my '76 Campmobile.  Lots of warm, 
clean air now available!

One problem has now surfaced.  I noticed that, after driving only about 8 
miles, the center of the rear bumper is very hot to the touch.  I have a 
(newer) Pacesetter muffler.  The engine compartment does not seem any warmer 
than before the new exchangers were installed.

I had to remove a custom trailer hitch in order to remove the old exchanges 
and have not yet reinstalled it.  I bolts to the center area of the bumpber 
and has braces that mount on the frame at four points.  It's very 
substantial.  Could the the hitch have acted as a giant heat sink?  I have 
definitely not noticed the heated bumpber before this.

Any experience on this out there?  Help is appreciated.

Thanks and best regards,
Walt Fogle
