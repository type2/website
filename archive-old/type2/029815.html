&gt; Hey y'all:
&gt; 
&gt; I came across this website while on one of my infinite quests for knowledge, and I thought it was very interesting.

&gt; 
&gt; They claim their epoxy is designed for bonding steel body panels, and is as strong as welding.  They seem to have crash tests to back it up.  They also have urethane fillers for things like the insides of body panels and door frames, which companies like Infiniti and Lexus use to stiffen and quiet their cars' chassis'.  Anybody ever use this stuff??  I'm tempted!

Bonding can be as good as welding, _if_ the joints are designed for
bonding.  You don't make a butt-joint with epoxy!
