[...]This might be just my own misconception, but, before I added the 
coil over shock  helper springs to my bus, it felt like the understeer 
was alot worse than it is now. If anything, the helper springs have 
reduced body roll.  As for tire wear, it would be hard for me to judge 
that, as my tires were shot and got replaced about the same time as I 
added the helper springs.

&gt; 'saggy butt' that i have seen on so many

&gt; improper tire wear or other suspension
&gt; woes? just curious.
