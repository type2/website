Subject: Re: [T2] S boot redesign

The only &quot;S&quot; Boot that's been in prototyping stage so far is for the Vanagon
80-83 Air Cooled and eventually the Wasserboxer Vanagons.  Airhead/VWG may
look into doing the Bay Window &quot;S: Boot eventually, but minimum production
runs (1000 pc minimum), material &amp; tooling costs, the marketability and the
end cost to the consumer is what will make or break on doing this &quot;S&quot; Boot.
VW gets around $70 to $80 for a Wasserboxer &quot;S&quot; Boot and we feel that's way
too high to begin with - we wanna target around $40 to $50 tops.  I honestly
don't think the average Bay Window Owner is gonna wanna shell out $120.
Most Bay Window owners (and these are mostly off-list) I still encounter
have ripped out their FI and moved onto carbs or are resistant to spending
more than what they can get away with in the &quot;baling wire&quot; department to
just get down the road.  I have to keep in mind that this List (as great and
as &quot;picky&quot; as they are [and rightly so]) is just a microcosm of Bay Window
owners everywhere, thus reproduction of anything has to be based on the
&quot;bigger&quot; picture of being able to do it and still stay in business (and pay
my meager wage [remember, I'm just a peon now, not an owner anymore], along
with others).

I'll have to look in my stash to make sure, but I think I have a couple of
nice used ones I've picked in my travels - $35 including postage.  I might
find another or more this weekend at the Hot VWs Drag Day Swap this Sunday.
I always keep my eyes peeled for these.

&gt; That's why I posted the original gripe. OldVolks/Airhead's been
&gt; working on repro'ing lots of parts so why not this one? I've seen many
&gt; parts in odd shapes made out of silicone (for the ricer crowd) so it
&gt; shouldn't be too difficult to do our S-Boot.
&gt; It would be worth the $120-ish a silicone one would cost.
&gt; In the meantime, I've ordered one of the crappy repros from eBay and
&gt; will start investigating an off-the-shelf replacement since I doubt
&gt; that repro will last...
