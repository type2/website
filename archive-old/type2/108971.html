Subject: RE: [T2] smelly noisy brakes

I know that the rear brakes on my buses need to be manually
calibrated.  Is it possible that you may be wearing on your brake
pads unevenly?  Do the rear drums self calibrate? or are they more
like those on my 76?  Might worth grabbing a 46mm socket, a breaker
bar, and a cotter pin, some stands and take a look.  I know that you
can't always see if the pads are truly wearing unevenly by looking
through the hole in back of the plate.  Sometimes you just gotta get
in there.
