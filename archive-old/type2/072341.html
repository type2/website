Hey listers,


&quot; The propane, only time will tell, though I suppose someone with more
inclination than I could calc out the average number of btus in a
gallon of propane and estimate it.  I suspect that Mike's estimate of
3-4 days is about right.&quot;

A gallon of propane has about 90,000 btus.  Just happen to know that 
tidbit......
