Subject: Re: [T2] door track

&gt; The (Klokkerholm--from Bus Depot) slider track that?I got was not welded 
&gt; together right.??At the front of the?track the slot for the vertical roller 
&gt; tapered so that it was too narrow at the front (as installed on?the bus)? to 
&gt; allow the door to close.? I had to drill the spot welds out about a foot or so 
&gt; back and use my lower door bracket and rollers to adjust the space correctly.? 
&gt; If you weld the track in without checking this, you won't be able to correct 
&gt; it with the track piece welded in.

   Oh nice...;-(
