Subject: vacuum assist brakes

I have a quick question about the power assist brakes on a 1971 bus. I
recently moved my 1600 engine from a 1970 to a 71 bus.  The 71 has disc brakes
in the front and drums in the back as the 70 had drums all around.

The question I have is where to connect the hose (on the engine end) that goes
to the booster on the master cylinder? A dumb question perhaps but the 71 came
w/o an engine and I can't get a good answer in any manual.

The 1600 I installed is a dual port. On the fan shrouding next to the
generator there is an outlet suggesting that some type of tubing gets
connected and on the intake manifold for cylinders 3-4 there is another tubing
connection, although this is for very small tubing, like the diameter of fuel
line. The latter is blocked off while the former is open.

Can anyone tell me (A) what are these two tubing outlets on the engine are for
and (B) where I am supposed to connect the brake assist hose?

This bus stops fine however my right leg is getting larger than my left and it
is beginning to affect my gait.  And yes I have checked the one way valve and
it works fine.

Thanks in advance,
