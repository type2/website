Subject: [T2] Heater Seminar

Well I hope that all 25 people that came to the heater seminar today in KC
have made it safely home.  The seminar was a wealth of material.  In one day
I learned more than the last 5 I have been collecting parts and heaters and
their manuals.  Rick and Pink did a great job of planning the material and
Rick did a outstanding job of presenting the material.  The handout that
they included in the seminar were very informative and as soon as I get a
rebuild kit I will be restoring my heater for the bus.  Remember the seminar
was video taped and can be gotten through Pink Newell at PINKNEWELL_at_aol_dot_com
and he has original South wind manual reprints and a bunch of photocopied
manuals for Southwind and Eberspracher's
They had done their research and I enjoyed it allot.  Good to see the
Midwest Bus Nutz
