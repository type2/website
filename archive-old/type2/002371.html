Subject: 1600 bug in a bus
Message-ID: &lt;001701bf1600$84546e00$83ef0a3f_at_oemcomputer&gt;

Hello I just picked up a 1600 bug engine that has an alternator.  The wires
to the alternator are connected by a three prong plug.  Because it was outta
a bug I didn't get a good look to where those wires go.  The thick red one
either goes to battery or to solenoid. But after that?  IM sure I could play
trial and error but,  I figured I would post and see what you guys say.  Is
going in to a 72 westy that had a  1600 w/ a generator, I still have 72
wiring though.
Thank in advanced
Chad
