Subject: RE: [T2] Type 4 dual carb spark plugs

Hi Richard

The only plugs besides the recommended Bosch W8CC I would try in a type4 is
the Bosch W8DTC or the W7DTC (cooler for the summer) plug that is a Copper
triple electrode, I have noticed a difference in performance with them, I
would stay away from the Platinum plugs in an air cooled , I have heard of
several reports of the porcelain coming loose and blowing out! 
Do a Google search on &quot;sparkplugs_passenger.pdf&quot; and use the &quot;INTERNET
PLUGS&quot; link this is a vary good reference glide from Bosch for there plugs.
I have tried to put the link in but it never works :(

Doug...

Subject: [T2] Type 4 dual carb spark plugs


Hi all,
Chasing new plugs at the moment.
I have used Bosch W8CC and Beru 14-7 AU plugs in the past.
I was wondering if there is any benefit in going for the new 4 electrode
styles they both produce??
Bosch super4 (WR78??)
Beru UltraX (part number???)
Thanks,
Richard

PS This is for a new stock re-built motor (2L dual carb)
I will also be adding compufire ignition to stock leads + coil.
