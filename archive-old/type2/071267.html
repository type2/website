Hi all! Looks like my bus isn't going to make it to the Bug-Out after all. 
With all this wet weather we have had in my area the past couple of weekends, 
I have not been able to tackle the master cylinder issue and finish up my 
body work. I'd go if the master cylinder didn't need replacing and I was sure 
I'd stop and go when i wanted to. 
Anyway, I'm still going in my water-cooled VW and hoping to meet some of you 
there! I'm a short redhead, and I'll be with my brother who isn't! Anyway, if 
you see me introduce yourself! Always a pleasure to meet a busser!
