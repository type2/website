Subject: fiberglass parts???



Just sitting here wondering if any place makes fiberglass parts for busses?
By parts I mean: front doors, cargo doors, engine lid, those kind of
parts.  I know there's places that sell fiberglass parts for beetles, just
wondering if there was the same for busses....

Curious busser,

'69 hardtop camper- just got it on the road for the 1st time &amp; it's already
stored for winter. : (
