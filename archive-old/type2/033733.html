Has anyone ever seen how the Winabago drivers &quot;spot&quot; there friends?
I was told that the large numbers near the top corner of the camper is the
ID number.. so if you see a &quot;friend&quot; you can log the number, date and
location,,, ,, and, well, I don't know what for,, but i guess so that if you
meet up you can see how many times you've passed each other,,

I was wondering if that would be able to apply here,, I have a Type 2
Sticker on my Camper ,, not to easy to pick out on the road tho,, but lots
of people notice it at the shows
So i guess i am suggesting that We put a &quot;sign&quot; on the bus.....
1 idea I had was to &quot;label&quot; buses in a boat tradition,,, All buses have a
name.. So why not put the name on the back window,, for example,,
or,,, put a registry number on the front passenger side windshield,,,,

Just my Ramblin's ,, but Look for My Bus to be &quot;labelled&quot; in 2000,,
 Back window will read:
(indian nick name first,, as in Kevin Costner movie fashion, then real
name, )

&quot;Watermelon&quot;

&gt;I am glad to hear that other list members do the same thing with their kids
&gt;on long
&gt;trips.  Could you send me your point schedule for each vehicle.
&gt;
&gt;Also this brings me to another question regarding the buses by the boulders
&gt;in Joshua Tree national park.  I was on 395 going north when I saw a blue
&gt;bus camper with the tall fiberglass shell on the top heading south.  Was
&gt;this a list member heading to the Joshua Tree campout?

&gt;&gt; And I'm a bad influence on my roommate: She's starting to see buses
&gt;&gt; everywhere and point them out. Like last week we were watching TV and
&gt;&gt; that commerical for the the gigolo movie came on and she jumped on it --
&gt;&gt; &quot;Bus! Bus!&quot;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;We play a game with our kids (it was especially hard on the trip to
&gt;alaska this year) where they get so many points for a bug, so many for a
&gt;motorcycle and so many for a bus (VW, of course).  First one to holler
&gt;out &quot;BUS, BUS&quot; or bug or what-have-you, gets the points.
&gt;
&gt;Now they even do it while we're watching movies--caught quite a few
&gt;sightings of baywindows as well as the splits this way!
