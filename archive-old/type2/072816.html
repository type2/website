Subject: Valve noise

I think what you are hearing are your hydraulic lifters.  Sometimes they
take time to pump up.  Does this problem occur primarily when starting
cold?  Does it go away after the engine has warmed up?

My '79 bus did this when I bought it (1990), and it freaked me out at
first.  I thought the engine was going to come apart.  The car continued to
do this occasionally for the next 45,000 miles, particularly after not
being driven for more than a couple of days.  The engine would always run
fine (I love FI) and I learned that the noise would eventually go away
after being driven for 5 or 10 minutes.  I drove the car for 45k until I
discovered 65 lbs in ole #3 in a compression test last fall and decided to
rebuild at 135,000 miles.  The low compression was due to a dropped valve
seat, which I fortunately caught before it trashed the engine.  Since the
clackety noise often occurred on the #1/2 side of the engine (though not
always) I doubt that it could be attributed to the dropped valve seat. That
and the fact that I doubt that the engine would have lasted for 45k with a
dropped seat.

I, like you found it disconcerting at first, but learned to ignore it.
Maybe its the price we gotta pay for having hydraulics.
