Subject: [T2] getting over the bleeding hump

all the big tasks were done...i thought. rebuilt calipers, new front
bearings, wheel cylinders, new shoes, pads, and brake cables. it was all
going downhill! bleed the brakes, and top it off right?

right rear wheel bleed has become a curiousity and i'd like to ask the list
about it. i have mushy brakes. during the first part of the bleed process i
got a good deal of pressure built. when i opened the cylinder valve on that
rear passenger side, little or usually no fluid came out. its a brief
sputter, like an old timey soda jerk gassy kind of sound. the brand new
&quot;german&quot; wheel cylinder is tight to the brake line - no obvious hiss or
fluid there. the bleeder valve was cheese, so i put a new old one in.
better, but still no horse p!ss from the open valve. all the other valves -
on tight.

Q: i've been going around and bleeding each wheel for a few hours. topping
the reservoir going around the circle. any hints, clues, &amp; help?

always appreciative,
steve
