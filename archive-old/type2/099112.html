This is a federal law applicable in any state, not just florida.

 i have a good offer on jerri [my Bus] from a guy in the US, the
 trouble is he can't seem to get around customs until
 jan. 1 2003 when the bus is 25 years old.  the dep't of
 vehicles down there says he has to pay $500 to get it
 inspected for the US.  the odd thing is that Jerri is
 from FLA???

 any ideas?
