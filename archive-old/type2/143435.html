That would rock for puttering around town! Zero gas! WooHoo!

You guys forget the 2nd law of thermodynamics...there's no
free lunch... ?-(

Zero gas??? How does that air get compressed if not by some
energy source? Hydroelectric...Natural gas...Newclear (wink,
wink)...Ethanol (BTW, corn's no free ride, either...Since a gal-
lon of ethanol already has a $.59 per gallon subsidy in addition
to the petro-based fertilizer, insecticide, and farm machinery
used to grow it...)
