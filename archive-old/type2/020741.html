X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

I agree with Tim Stephens that it's time to find out what's wrong by
pulling the engine- difficult at this very time, and I just wanted to
have a reasoned guess how long I can wait.  
     As you might guess, my family is in medical fields- sister in law a
doctor, wife is a pathologist, and I am a histologist who taught the
tissues of the body to many premedical students.  It is the nature of
people mechanics to glean all that can be from the symptoms and tests
without ripping in there and seeing what's wrong.
   Speculating on what is wrong is not necessarily wasted time- we are
biased if we find out what's wrong first and then try to shoehorn the
symptoms to it.......better to apply all logic now to all possible
tests, make theories, and then pull it apart to see if our theories were
accurate.  In this case, trying to separate whether it is a worn clutch
disk, a warped/loose pressure plate, or a failed pilot bearing.  Ideally
the sound should be recorded and later associated with what was really
rubbing.

&gt; 
&gt; I'm sorry, Mike, but I repeat and elaborate. You have symptoms of poor
&gt; function. You are on an exponential curve to failure. Time spent
&gt; speculating on which of the several parts in there is the problem is wasted
&gt; time. The solution to your problem will not be known until to pull the
&gt; clutch and inspect the parts.
&gt; 
&gt; Then you can tell us what failed and you and the rest of us can try to
&gt; explain why you had the symptoms you had, and we will all know more.
