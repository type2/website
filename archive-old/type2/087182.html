&gt; I wasn't sure waht to put in the subject line here. I wanted to thank
&gt; the generous person that secretly replaced my broken rear side marker
&gt; light on my bus while I was at EB 2002. I was part way home when I went
&gt; to show one of my fellow canadian travelers where a woman had clipped my
&gt; rear bumper and broke my marker light when to my surprise it was no
&gt; longer broken. So whoever did it , my thanks go out to you!
