Subject: Tapping ECU temporary fix.

David: If you had an ECU problem you could fix with percussive maintainance
(tapping it;-) then it is most likely
that your problem with your ECU is no a bad component, but rather a bad
connection.
You should take the cover off, and inspect if carefully for broken wires, or
circuit tracks on the circuit board.
Barring that it could be a cold solder joint. This is a joint that due to
aging effects has crystalized, and though it
looks good, it is no longer an electrical connection. If your ECU is toast
anyways it might be worth
going over it with a soldering pencil, or iron briefly remelting the solder
on each and every component lead
where they  are soldered to the circuit board. This is tedious, but may save
you $$ in trade for time.
Note if you don't have a lot of experience in electronics, note that you can
damage parts
by heating the leads for too long, so don't keep applying heat for
more than a few seconds after the solder initially melts.
