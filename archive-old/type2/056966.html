Subject: Sold '69 and '66

Well volks,

I sold the '69 Westfalia.  I suppose that makes 
me a wannabusser.  I guess what I want is a perfectly
rust free, low mileage, 82 Vanagon camper.  Or a perfectly
rust free 62 Sunroof Deluxe.  Anything lesser than these,
and I would better have kept &quot;We Made It!&quot;.

Alas, I asked an asking price, and was offered that price.
I also sold the '66 Squareback, or gave it away rather.

I am now vw-less.  I drive a 6-cylinder Jeep now.  Nobody 
waves, honks, or freaks out. :-(
