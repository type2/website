Subject: Cool tin...

Hi Volks;
   In the midst of reconstruction of my 78 Westy. Fellow listee Mike
Gensler helped with the engine pull and pointed out that I am missing
the part of the shroud/cooling tin that resides under the push rod tubes
on the left hand side of the engine (front is front, up is up, under is
under). Checked out numerous local junkyards, my old friend Dieter
Mueller (the cantankerous VW/ Mercedes mechanic and an actual German),
checked with the Bus Depot...and nobody seems to have this piece of Type
IV tin.
   Anybody out there have a spare? Willing to pay a reasonable fee &amp;
postage.

78 Westy (under reconstruction)
69 &amp; 73 Bugs (ditto)
2 many cats....
