Subject: 78 brake drum bolts

In examining with the wheels/brakes of my 78 bus, I found one rear
wheel that didn't have the two 6mm bolts holding the drum to the hub.
How important are these two bolts?  I figure most of the &quot;staying
power&quot; is provided by the 5 wheel lugs.  I'll replace the 2 bolts the
next time I have the wheel off, but is it safe to drive this way?
I.e., does the next time need to be before I drive the bus?
