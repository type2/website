By the way, the remaining heater control lever/cable can be used for both
heater boxes, even thought i never did that.

Lots of American trucks from the 60s and 70s had a throttle cable just as
you describe.  My 73 bronco has it.  It works just like a bicycle cable
or a choke cable and attaches to the pedal.

That was my first thought, but I didn't think you'd sacrifice a heater
control lever.  I might adopt your idea myself  =)

&gt;&gt; Suspense over for all you brick heads,
&gt; I sacrificed one of my heater control and attached the cable to the
&gt; swivel piece just below the gas pedal.  The control held well enough
and
&gt; i could even adjust the throttle with the lever.  That was on my first
&gt; camper ever, a '70 in 1986. &lt;&lt;
