Posted this once before, but what with all the welding/body talk aflying
maybe folks will find this relevant now...
I need A) advice on how to fix the passenger-side door pillar. DSPO had cut
it at
floor level to rivet in new flooring (like cutting your head off to get a tooth
filled!).
and B) does any body out there have pros/cons on various suppliers of
replacement body tin? There are three or four, and I would like to know
which seem
to use thicker steel, best values, etc.

And C) maybe I'm just being paranoid, but it seems that only Westy and Canuck
subscribers get many responses... is there a VW pickup list I should banish
myself to?
