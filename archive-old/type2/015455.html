&gt;On this, John probably means basically the Bosch Super.  Particularly
&gt;in my experience the Indian made Supers.  

Is this a reservation Indian or the Hindu variety. I haven't seen yet a
Super made by either.
You can bet if I ever do, I will scrutinize them with a hand glass and a
VOM for the details before I install one. The only Bosch products I know
not to use are the oil filters. They are an attempt to get a piece of the
&quot;designed to be cheap loss leaders&quot; market and they show it, like all that
market. Cheap labor in a struggling country is not even close to properly
inspected German parts designed to work in harmony with the system as
originally designed and manufactured in Germany. 

German made old stock,
&gt;or German tri-electrode are great plugs.  The Bosch (and any other)
&gt;platinum plug with a small center electrode isn't a great idea in
&gt;an air-cooled vehicle 

The Platinum plugs were designed for the later higher energy systems that
came out in the 80's. the stock older 20-25kv energy is half of the 35-45k
later systems. Stay within the system. Even Mercedes proved in their test
that with the later systems, the improvement with Platinum plugs was barly
measurable, so they continue to advise Supers for the second iteration
systems.
