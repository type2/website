The van runs, but the engine doesn't sound so good - it a knocking,
rattling sound. Sometimes it sounds more like a sputtering as if there
were a hole in the exhaust, but there is definitely a not-so-good sound
coming from the engine. It's tired, I believe. The transmission is fine;
I put it in (used) myself a year or so ago. The clutch and suspension
are in fine shape. I renewed the air flow meter, the clutch master
cylinder, the plugs/wires/cap/rotor, and the fuel lines within the last
3000 miles. The body is a bit beat up with rust in numerous places. The
windshield is cracked. The canvas is in fine shape though the zipper on
the window is busted. I've never attempted to get the stove or fridge
working (no interest), but they're there.

This van is *not* smogged or registered.
