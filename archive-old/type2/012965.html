Remove the lower pushrod cover sheetmetal and spray some GUNK engine
cleaner up around both ends of the pushrod tubes. Get it as clean as you
can and then run the engine and check for leaks. You may need to use a
really bright flashlight and a hand mirror to see all of the seal
locations.

You may also want to run the engine up to about 3000 RPM and place your
palm over the open end of your oil filler tube and check for crancase
preasure, that'll cause leaks at the pushrods.

If you remove the valve covers be shure to replace the gaskets with new
gaskets.
