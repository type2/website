Subject: Re: Casualty! ........fingertips and solvents

This may be better for Fri, but pertains to busses and is prompted
by the post on &quot;cleaning injury&quot;.  I've been playing with busses ever
since I couldn't afford mechanic's costs to do tuneups when I started
(in college-1971).  Today I don't do a lot of needed work (the '63
camper is still sitting in the garage) because I also play a woodwind
instrument and suffer with what's been dignosed as a work-induced
psoriasis of the hands (and knees!).  In short, I get
cracking/thickening of the skin in the fingertips, sides of the fingers,
and parts of the palms.  Being a histologist, I know it's because the
skin has lost its elasticity (yes it makes elastic fibers) and undergoes
&quot;hyperkeratosis&quot;-making more cells than it is sloughing.  We NEED our
skin to be elastic, or any shear/pressure forces will cause it to crack-
it's like using gloves made of paper instead of rubber.  Believe me,
these cracks may seem superficial, but they are painful and makes it
hard to handle tools.  As they heal, scar tissue forms, so I have a
thickening of these areas that eventually means the fingers are more
numb (hard to do fine work)- and scar tissue is not elastic as any burn
vistim knows.  Also, with me. areas with a lot of friction/pressure
(knees, palm, have a skin thickening that's not callused, because they
form cracks and can itch- a sign of psoriasis, where blood vessels grow
up into thickened areas of hyperkeratosis.  Significantly it's a lot
worse on the left knee- the one I kneel on.
    The upshot is, PROTECT those fingers, especially from solvents! Wear
pants, not shorts!  I handled a lot of solvents (acetone, benzene,
alcohol) in my work in microscopy, and also did my ignorant share of
washing bus parts (I remember rebuilding an engine in the lab
storeroom!) with solvents, including gasoline.  I'd be curious to know
if other long time home mechanics have been affected in a similar
manner, for it should serve as a warning to newbies, who should be USING
GLOVES when handling all those dirty parts or even doing
&quot;pressure/push-pull&quot; work like constant polishing or unscrewing.
