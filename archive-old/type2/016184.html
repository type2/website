&gt;I had #2 spark plug blow out of the head today on my 1700 . Anyone ever
&gt;put a insert in with the engine still in the bus.??
&gt;Want to get this fixed so I can head to Everybus on Wed of next week.
&gt;ARRRRRGH.

     I've done this, but I would not actually recommend it.  It's a risky
fix, but here's what I did.  There are actually two types of inserts.  One
(the helicoil) looks like a spring and the other (several brandnames) looks
like a sleeve.  I used the sleeve because I have never had a good experience
with a helicoil.  It came in a kit from the FLAPS that included a tap, a
flaring chisel type tool, and 3 metric inserts specifically for spark plugs.
The three inserts were the same diameter, but different lengths.  Choose the
insert that fits perfectly onto your spark plug.  Place grease on the tip
and threads of the tap. Grease, rather than oil, on the tap will catch some,
but not all shavings.  Try to get the tap started by hand into any threads
in the plug hole that may be remaining.  Make CERTAIN to keep the tap
STRAGHT.  If you get the threads crooked then you're screwed.  Insert the
tap slowly until fully threaded through the hole.  Remove the tap carefully
to keep what few shavings were caught by the grease.  Before you insert the
sleeve try to start the bus.  If it starts, great, but if not then crank on
it for at least 30-45 seconds.  This will blow most of the shavings out the
plug hole and out of your cylinder.  Now use a pipe cleaner, cotton swab,
paper towel, bottle brush, or whatever you can to clean the grease from the
plug hole.  You need to clean all the grease from the hole.  I use
compressed air and carb cleaner.  Make certain the plug hole is clean and
dry then put some antiseize on the plug and thread the insert onto the plug.
Wipe off excess completely.  Now put some high strength thread locker
(Loctite Red) on the insert.  I'm not certain the Loctite tread locker will
help due to the high temps generated by the cylinder head, but it doesn't
hurt.  Start the plug and insert by hand and tighten with a ratchet to
normal plug torque, which for me is about 12-14 lbs.  Wait at least 24 hours
before starting the bus to give the Loctite a chance to cure.  After a
couple of days you can gently remove the plug and use the flaring tool to
mushroom the top of the insert.  This helps to lock the insert in place.

     I have done this a couple of times with good results.  The best thing
you can do to avoid future problems is check your plugs regularly, use
antiseize, and ALWAYS work on plugs with your engine COLD.  Good luck.
