Subject: heater box recirculation

has anyone ever thought about recapturing all that wasted heat that is expelled from the heater boxes when they're not 'open'? seems like that hot air could be routed back to the engine compartment and, if the inlet was strategically placed, reduce warmup time significantly. once at operating temp, the heater box flaps could be opened, directing heat to the cabin. *let's hear those opinions!*
