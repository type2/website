Subject: 36HP Engine

Folks,

I recently acquired both a 36HP and a 40HP engine from a workshop that was 
closing down. They came in a job lot with a whole of other VW stuff for $10.

I don't know much about early VW engines. I know quite a lot about the 
1776 upright that I've got in my '72 Microbus.

The 36HP was apparently running before it was put into a shed at the 
workshop but now doesn't have a carby, and the generator has some sort of 
bracket welded onto it. 

I want to try and sell the 36HP as a complete unit at the Flat Four Club's 
Shootout in Sydney in November. 

Will the carby and the generator from the 40HP swap onto the 36HP?
