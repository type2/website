Hello,
First off, thanks to all who replied to my Porsche query!!  I got a 
*lot* of responses and am still in the process of answering a few of 
them.  I've learned a good bit about the early 911 just from the 
responses!  I'm keeping my eye out for just the right one now :)

Second-
Whats all involved in lowering a bay window bus?  Its an adjustable beam 
up front, and adjustable/altered??  spring plates in the back I believe...

What does this do for tire sizes, if anything?  This would be for a 71 
bus if that makes any difference...  What size tires could or would you 
need to run?

Thanks for any info!!
Isaiah
