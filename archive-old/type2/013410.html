I don't think 75 is so unreasonable or unsafe in a bus - interstate stuff i'm
talking. 
Also - with this gearing i don't think i'd spend alot of time up there, but
i'd like to be able to do it if i needed to...

60 at 4G.  That means 75 at 5G.  I wouldn't worry providing I had
plenty of life insurance and was ready to check out.  Oh well, at
least the 71 has vacuum assisted disc brakes.


&gt;A bus engine spends most of its life around (or above)4G - why not
&gt;counterweight?  I think it makes perfect sense.
&gt;
&gt;Everyone i've talked to says &quot;...if you don't run a counterweighted 
&gt;crank,
&gt;then don't see much above 4G...&quot;
&gt;
&gt;Well, in my 71 with the 5.38 tranny, 4g is probably gonna put me at 
&gt;about 60. 
&gt;With the counterweight, i wouldn't worry so hard about seeing 5G...
&gt;
&gt;my .02,
