Subject: Pop top order fiasco

Where (besides bus depot) can I order a replacement pop top canvas for my 76
Westy?

Let me start by saying that my first several orders from The Bus Depot went
very smoothly, however the last few went really sideways...

I called them several weeks ago asking if they had the canvas in stock, they
told me no, but that they were expecting a large shipment soon.  I asked if
I should wait or order it right away.  The gentleman that I spoke to told me
that they had way more than enough to cover the back orders and that I could
call back in a week or so and place the order, which I did.  I placed the
order online this past weekend, and called Monday morning to confirm that
the one I ordered (a grey one) was in stock.  I was told that it was, and
that it would be sent out immediately.  I usually receive my orders from the
Bus Depot within 24 hours since I live so close, so today when I didn't get
it I called back.  I was told that they were sold out of the grey, and it
would take 2 to 3 weeks to get it to me, so I asked to switch to tan, and I
was told that they just sold out today... had I been told yesterday that
they did NOT in fact have enough grey to cover my order I would have
switched to the tan then... So now I'm told they have plenty of the bright
yellow in stock... or I can pay 3 day shipping from CA to have them drop
shipped from their supplier... which is just way too much money for me to
pay right now...

SO (when I get my bus back from the electricians,) I had hoped to take it
camping this coming weekend, which is now out of the question without a pop
top...  Sorry to vent, but I'm just really disappointed in the way this
transaction was handled...
