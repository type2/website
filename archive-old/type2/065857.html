&gt;Okay, go up to the Wal-Mart and hike to the automotive department. See if
&gt;they have a big mountain of somethings called &quot;MVP SuperLift.&quot; I don't know
&gt;whether all the stores carry the same thing but I bet they do. Run you
&gt;$19.95.
&gt;
&gt;This is just like a hydraulic floor jack, but in miniature. It's about 18
&gt;inches long. Four casters. Rated 2000 lb capacity, it says, so don't go
&gt;jacking your bus up with this and crawling underneath. But it seems to me
&gt;to be the perfect aircooled engine puller. Haven't tried it yet. The
&gt;jack-point thing, the cup-shaped deal that touches the bus, is detachable
&gt;with a little cotter pin, which means it will be simple to make an
&gt;eight-inch square platform out of thick plywood that will pin to the jack
&gt;and will be secure and stay square.
&gt;
&gt;Seems to weigh about 25 lbs, so you can carry it in the bus easily--let's
&gt;make that next roadside rebuild a low-effort proposition, people! ;)
&gt;
I have one of these and it works GREAT. It doesn't have enough lift to
raise the whole car, but it is perfect for engine pulls. I never travel
without carrying it with my other tools. You can even use it at the
roadside if you carry a plank of wood to give it a &quot;road&quot; to roll on. I
would recommend that every Bus driver has one.
