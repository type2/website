Joe, I understand how you feel. 
Last weekend I finally kissed goodbye my 72 single cab to a happy home where he will arise....well, part of him will but that's another story. 
Anyway, grieve if you must........I went through all 7 stages with the 72. 
But look ahead now........console you self with the fact that your pay cheques can now dedicate themselves to a diminished number of buses. 
That's right, you've just improved the living standards of your......was it 10 or more.......well, the remaining buses. 
And one day soon you'll be puttering down the road once again reminding everyone that you WERE intending to do something with all those old things they regard as eyesores 

Now, if I can just focus on my Split window 67 panel........



Cheers

Andrew Wood
