Subject: Learn from my mistakes....or the Diesel Splitty

Here is a diesel conversion you might not want to try.

I was leaving my little rented shop that I share with another bus crazy
last night after a good bit of work digging through my own junk looking
for cool parts, cleaning, spraypainting windowframe parts that I plan to
assemble someday... when I noticed that Eugene the green was running on
fumes.
No worries says I, I see my ol buddy Jose has a gallon gas can over
there in the corner between a couple bug bumpers and that type3 fender.
Red, says gasoline on it, so I toss it in the tank. Wooo woo and off we
go. 
Three blocks later I am smoking hard and losing power. Argh! Engine
quits and I pull into a closed Chevron and pull a fuel line, smell.--
Diesel. 

'Bout then my flashlight decides to go out on me. My spare flashlight is
in Kelli's Toyota, so I am SOL. So I find a plastic container and let
the line that goes into the fuelpump drain. Slow. But I have no light
and that line out of the tank is hard to get to when you can see it, so
I wait. And Wait, and empty the thing a couple times. Meanwhile I pull
the cap so I can unscrew the cut-off switch and take out the 14mm plug
on the carb bowl and drain it and blow out the other lines. When the
container is collecting at a trickle, I lock up my bus (with like $2000
in tools) and hoof it home. 
So then I'm back with the Toyota and a good flashlight some time later
and the bottle is about to overflow, so I empty it and get under and
pull the line out of the tank, and manage to get Diesel all over myself
and the heaterbox on the drivers side. Very delicate smell. 

Put in a gallon of gasoline that was previously destined for the
lawnmower, and crank her over, one hand on the fire extinguisher. Cough,
choke, wheeze, and a whole lotta diesel still in the lines...smoking
like the beer garden at a zappa concert...
About this time Kelli shows up ( I had left her a note saying I was out
of gas when I got home for the pickup) and declares seeing the smoke &quot;I
guess its more than just out of gas, huh?&quot;  She's lucky I love her.
Well, It wouldn't idle so I had her work the key while I nused it in
back, burning out all the diesel remaining in the system, but never did
get it to idle.
Today I blew out the idle jet and the hole where it goes, and noticed
that I never did re-hook the electric cut-off switch. Filled it with
premium and burned it out on a good drive after work, and all seems
well.

But not an experience I would recommend.

I still don't know why the hell he had diesle in a gas can. We have
parts cleaner and solvent.   But  it is my fault for not smelling the
stuff before I put it in my tank.  Not a mistake I will make again. 

Maybe someone else will learnn from my mistake. Then again, maybe no one
else is that stupid to begin with.
