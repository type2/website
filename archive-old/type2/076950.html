Subject: VW-GDead article from 3-92 Car and Driver

I like this article, it does sort of try to explain the inexplicable 
connection between the VW and Dead cultures. Of course, since they each 
mean something unique to every individual, I'm not altogether sure that 
it's possible to fully grok the relationship. 

It just is.  ;-)

I did an interview with the BBC for a show about Jerry and the Dead on 
the 5th anniversary of Jerry's death, and made it into the final edit of 
the program. The following page has a photo of me in my original 
Netvergnugen shirt (w/the lenti.umn_dot_edu address)-also has the video for 
any who care to see it:
