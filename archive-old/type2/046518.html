It couldn't hurt to ask the mechanic. What's the worst he
could do tell you no. But then again most of the mechanics
I've know are pretty nice, but I don't know what the story is
like where your from.

When I first bought my bus I felt the same about doing the
work my self. The how to keep your VW alive book is easy to
follow and fun reading. Its commonly referred to as the muir
book. I found mine at B&amp;N, worth every penny IMO.
If I got the hang of it iam sure you could too.

Read the book and see what you think.
After you read the tune-up section see if your welling
to give it a try.
Its really not as hard as it appears.

good luck

&gt;someone to show me. Im new to the coast otherwise id be calling &gt;on the

&gt;dont know where to turn, and maybe getting a mechanic to show me will be 
&gt;the best bet?
