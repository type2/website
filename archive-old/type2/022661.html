Hi Gang,
I need a favour ... (please note; &quot;favour&quot; is Canadian for &quot;favor&quot;)

I'm looking to borrow/rent/trade a reliable bus or vanagon for a week in November.

I'm coming to SD for a scientific conference, and bringing my family for a couple of days before. Thus, we need a people-mover for some short trips around town. I could rent a brand new minivan the traditional way, but it would end up costing close to wha
t I paid for my '78 and would spend most of the time parked. Then the idea struck that I could put out a call to The List for help. Can anyone lend me a bus while I'm in town ? I'm a responsable guy, and have been playing with VWs of one sort or another f
or 15 years now. I can set up my own insurance, I won't put many miles on it (we are staying in town) and would realy appreciate it. I will pay a fair price, or trade the use of my '78 in New Hampshire. 

Another option - I have a friend who just moved to SD and likes my bus, but is not what you call a &quot;car guy&quot;. He has asked my advice on purchasing a bus. If anyone is looking to sell a solid, drivable smog-legal bus or westy in SD, maybe you would be will
ing to let me &quot;demonstrate&quot; the fine art of Bus ownership to him for the week and then give him the option to purchase (consider it a one week lease with a buyout option)?

If neither of these options pan out - any ideas how to get an inexpensive van rental in SD ?

Thanks

Mike Harris
