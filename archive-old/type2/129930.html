Sounds like the classic case of worn throttle shaft bores. The shafts ride 
in pot metal which wears. Grab the lever on the end of the shaft and push 
and pull. Tiny bit of movement may be OK. More than a tiny bit, you need to 
have bushings installed and check the shafts for wear. Just verify this 
before you do any teardown and rebuilding cause it will be wasted time if 
the shafts or bores are worn.
