Jim Arnott sends:

&gt; (But if it doesn't, take your correct sized
&gt; socket and head to the local truck tyre fixer.  Have them use the king
&gt; sized rattle gun on it.  Tighten it back up by hand, put a cotter pin
&gt; back in and drive it home. An additional advantage to this method is
&gt; that the drive home will loosen the drum on the splines so that it
&gt; comes off easily.)

This would work, except that the engine is in many, many pieces...
