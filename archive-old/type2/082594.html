Subject: Re: [T2] racing buses on dirt

Sorry, Matty, but I'm with Phil.
I think that bus racing would kill too many buses that
might get back on the road legitimately.
Maybe you could organise &quot;Boneyard Bus Racing&quot; i.e. in
order to enter the bus you wish to race, you must have
the receipt from the boneyard you bought it in or at
least proof of a neglectful, unserviced &amp;
unregisterable period of at least 18 months before the
bus is allowed to enter.
In short, to stop any viable on-road buses being
turned into paddock bashers.
Other racing conditions should include wacky paint
jobs, and I don't mean racing stripes.....I mean ZEBRA
stripes or Hawaiian flowers all over the bus. 
As such, the scrutineering team should include a very
poor fashion designer or graffiti artist on community
service :-)
And yes, people should have to do community service
for poor fashion design ;-)
Anyhow, lets keep bus racing wacky if we must have it,
like most of the rest of the bus scene!
Oh &amp; Phil, the cheque's in the mail ;-)
:-)
Cheers

&gt; not only not encourage

&gt; dues are $20/year and a newsletter will be
