How about little hypertext links in the relevant passages that lead to
the relevant Hoover sermons :)

&gt; 
&gt;         While I too find the Semons of The Most Honorable Reverend Hoover
&gt; both enlightening and inspiring, I find many words of wisdom in the gospel
&gt; of Bentley. And Sir Hoover (I wonder how hard he's laughing as he reads
&gt; this) has mentioned time and again the use of other reference materials.
&gt; And while he is very knowedgeable, I don't think he has the resources to
&gt; have complete and full technical information on every aircooled VW. An
&gt; officially sanctioned CD would-at least in theory. Personally, I veiw Bob
&gt; (that is, other than as a friend) as the man who fills in the blanks.
&gt; Bentley can give excellent information, and forget to mention something
&gt; that Bob can answer from his long experience. In other words, the CD would
&gt; be like an encyclopedia, with trival but important things such as part
&gt; numbers, model year differences etc. The sermons can answer the questions
&gt; left foggy by Bentley. Took me a long time to say that, didn't it...   ;-)
&gt;
