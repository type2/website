There is one other place, which is the hydraulic lifter oil gallery.  There
are two, one each side.  My 78 had a gusher of an oil leak.  You have to
pull the engine and flywheel, just like for the Cam Plug.  Unlike the cam
plug, the oil galleries are sealed by an expansion plug.  It is an odd size.
If you can not find one that fits exactly ( i.e. a bit bigger than the bore,
try using a slightly smaller one, perhaps of copper and put in on a hard
surface, like a vice and hit it enough with a hammer to enlarge the
diameter.  Do not try and use a smaller one and hope to hold it in place
with JB weld or other epoxy.  Don't ask me how I know.   The oil pressure
against these expansion plugs is very high particularly in cold weather.
The PO said his bus started leaking massive amount of oil when he started it
one very cold morning.   If your clutch is not slipping now, you may not
need a new one. If this is the case, just drill a =&quot; hole in the bottom of
the bell housing and smaller leaks will just run out until you have the
opportunity to pull the engine and fix.  Good luck.  This one caused me an
untold amount of trouble and was not suggested any where as a possible
problem
