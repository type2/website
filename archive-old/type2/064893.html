Subject: Blow by and the Oil slinger

 An interesting tid bit - - -

 The last two engines I've torn down (t1 &amp; t3) had no oil slingers
on the tail end of the crank.

 I'm presently rebuilding one and was going by the book and memory
of disassembly. What is that in the picture?

 I have one of the cranks still assembled and I checked that, the 
other one was a core so I'd stripped it. I looked in the parts stripped and
there isn't one.

 So I'm not crazy.

 I assume that with out it, there is a good chance of leak at the 
pulley. 

 If you peoples are leaving them out well - - - - I think it will leak.

 The type 3 was a definite leaker in that area. That's why it was 
pulled.         west
