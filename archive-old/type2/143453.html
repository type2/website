Subject: Re: Shifter pops out 

Hey Aaron, not sure if this helps, but this happened to our 78, except it  
wouldn't stay in 1st and the shifting was overall pretty sloppy.  I thought  it 
was the transmission, so when I had the engine and tranny out I was going to  
switch the tranny out for another one.  I took the whole shifter  linkage out 
and apart and cleaned it and it turned out that the plastic  bushings, #'s 13 
and 16 on this picture:

were both broken and I fortunately had some from a donor and it really  
solved my problems.  
 
Maybe it will help, maybe not!
 
Good luck!
 
~Jeremy
