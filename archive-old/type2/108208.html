Subject: Friday Poll: Vanity plates

Hi Volks,

Last week I polled the list about parts that didn't break. Response was 
limited, so I will try something with wider appeal this week:

Best bus vanity plate. Submissions must be something you have seen in 
person, not dreamt up off the top of your head.

Personal favorites include Jamie Rivers &quot;2SLO 2BAD&quot;  and Collie Corner 
has &quot;WEB GEEK&quot;, which is also very apt. I saw a Maryland bus at 
EveryBus 2003 with &quot;CANABUS&quot; -- I would love to put that plate on my 
camper, but it would probably make for a hassle getting across the 
border. (My bus is very Canadian, but not chemically enhanced).

Please email me with your plates. If you're the owner of a plate I will 
list you by name on the final report, which will be posted later this 
weekend.


Happy trails,

Greg Potts
