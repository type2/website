Subject: RE: [T2] Bay seats

Can anyone confirm if the vanagon seats will/won't slip right in to a '70
westy? Are they only compatible with later year Bays? There are a few
vanagons around in the salvage yards that I would like to check out if
they'll work. Many thanks for all the input - it really is helping a lot!
If not - I think I'll stick with the stock setup. Thanks again!

Andrew

I thought the Vanagon seats slipped right in...

Thanks,

Nothing out there will just slide on the tracks you have on
