Subject: Warming it

I don't know the theoretic optimum, but the strategy  I follow is to warm the
engine enough to get it running smoothly, then drive away gently and slowly.
My driving consists of mainly short hops (probably the worst of all possible
worlds).  Muir really stresses the longer warm up of several minutes, and for
years I followed that policy.  Muir says to roll a cigarette while you warm it,
but I quit smoking years ago.
