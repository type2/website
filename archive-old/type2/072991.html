&gt;Nikki E - could you send me a price for the one exchanger? - don't know if
&gt;I'll need, yet.  Just getting ahead of myself, as usual.

Mark! I wish I could! But I don't have any 77 stuff! Wah! Funny thing -- in
junkyards out here, there are plenty of 72-74 and Vanagons, but the
in-between years are either still on the road or already stripped. Steve
and I found a complete 78 system, which he used on his 73 with a 78 engine
in it in Virginia (major rot -- hey, good name for a bus! :-) ), and I
found a 76 with the 72 exhaust on it, which seems to be a popular option.

Hopefully someone else will see your post and take heed. I understand
someone just ordered some exchanger from another supplier named Jim or
John, and you may be able to find this grail from another.

Nikki
