Subject: What year is my bus?

I just recieved an email from VW (Germany) with the info on my bus, and
now I am confused.

the VIN is 236000712 and the following is the info that they had:


- -------------------------------------
Model:            231 2
Engine:           H0 000 819
Colour:           not registered
Production date:  July 8th, 1965
Delivery date:    Aug. 31st, 1965
Delivered to:     New York, U.S.A.
- -------------------------------------

How can my bus be a '66?  Incidently, my bellhousing accepted a 12v flywheel.
