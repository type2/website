Just checking again to see if any list members from Northern VA/MD/DC
area will be attending this show.  If you are planning to attend and
will be able to courier back an upstairs cot for my daughter's 71 Westy,
it would be terrific.  Another listee will get to the show, but I can't
be there to get it home.  I wish I could, though, sounds like a great
time.  

TIA,
Karen
