Jed,
  I saved a type2 list note about brake boosters from approx. 1 1/2 years
ago.
H &amp; R Automotive Parts in Dallas, Texas (972-286-5516) rebuilds brake
boosters for
$105 including shipping.  Keep in mind that this note is over a year old so
I don't know
if it is still valid today, but it is sure worth a try.
