Subject: Re: [T2] High Beams Stuck

&gt; My high beams will not turn off.  I have a '71 Deluxe and turn signal 
&gt; doesn't click to turn off the high beams.  Any suggestions?  Thanks.

Another possibility.  When this happened to me, the problem was simply that 
the whole turn signal unit was loose in its mounting and also corroded.  I 
disassembled the unit from the steering column and worked some silicone lubricant 
into the mechanical parts of the switch.  Then I tightened up the screws 
holding everything together and replaced it on the column.  That gets me through a 
couple of years, when I have to repeat the procedure.  Good luck.

See you on the road,
Jerry
