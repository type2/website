Subject: RE: [T2] Bigger hole for VDO oil pressure sender?

I sized mine by dremel trial and error, with the tin out. After I installed the tin I realized that hole was large enough to allow me to install the tin over the sender, but would not allow the lower lip of the sender to come out, so I hope the thing doesn't fail before my next engine pull.
 
Due to the angle of the tin, it would be hard to make the hole large enough to R&amp;R the sender with the tin in place, but I would attempt to do that (or just use the hose).
 
I used vacuum line (split lengthwise) to seal the hole. Fits snuggly.
