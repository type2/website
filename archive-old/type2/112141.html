Subject: Anybody got a balljoint boot for a Type1? &amp; conditioning the
  boots.

Speaking of conditioning balljoint boots, has anyone got an extra lying around? They are for sale on various sites, but ridiculously priced, as much as a balljoint itself in some cases. I have a torn boot and have tried to mend it with various things, but of course it's a bandaid fix. I would appreciate anyone letting me know if they've seen a single one for sale or have a spare one kicking around off an old BJ. BTW, silicone spray is a good way to help preserve them. Glycerine is pretty messy, spray it with silicone instead spray instead. I used G.E. silicone spray which specifically says &quot;conditions rubber&quot;.
