Subject: [T2] drive train swap from 77 to 73

I have gone through some of the archives and seen a lot of either engine or 
tranny swaps which seems to require a bell housing change and or changing 
the engine mounts.

I would like to swap the entire 77 engine and tranny into a 73.  I plan on 
having the 2K engine rebuilt to run with dual 40 carbs.

Are the two complete drive trains the same length?

Can I use the 77 engine mounts in the 73?

Will I be able to hook up the heater?

Will I have to move the Throttle cable pipe?

Any other things I should know about?


thanks in advance,
harry
