I too had this problem in CA (where we tend to set stupid vehicular
regulation trends that the rest of you US folks have to deal with later,
sorry).  How I got out of RV plates was to bring an inspector out to the
parking lot and show them it had no toilet.  No toilet exempted it from
&quot;mobile residence&quot; status.  HTH,
