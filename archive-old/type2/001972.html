Jason doesn't mind that I post his response to everyone.

My wife and I had many entries, but this one got her. Some were serious and
others funny, while yet others wanted to outprice each other. As a mom who
went through something similar.... I have to salute all moms, who endure a
lot.

So the porta potti winner is Jason's family. All they pay is shipping.

Congrats :-)

&gt; is your address.  I have a story about when my son was 2 and he had a
&gt; Butt-Plosion in his car seat in the back of my westy.  It stank
&gt; sooooo bad I
&gt; tossed my cookies on the side of the road in Texas.  My wife was
&gt; the trooper
&gt; and cleaned up the mess.  I couldn't believe that that much STUFF
&gt; could come
&gt; out of his little body.  It blew the seals on his diaper and shot all over
&gt; his car seat and even flowed on the floor a bit.  If this isn't
&gt; good enought
&gt; for ya,  my wife be sure to worship the plastic goddess rather than the
&gt; porcelin goddess when she decides to get romantic and have a few
&gt; drinkd more
&gt; than she can handle.
