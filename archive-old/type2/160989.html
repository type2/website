Subject: Re: [T2] In Car Head Removal-Floating Valve Seat

&lt;&lt;hey Terry What would you call it when the seat comes loose and is just
held in place by the valve.&gt;&gt;

Mark,
At this point it's a loose seat bring held in place by nothing other
than the valve spring pressure.

The stem of the valve is keeping it from floating around in the
combustion chamber.

I guess my question is regarding this phenomena---
What makes him think it's a broke loose seat?
What makes you assume that it's an intake valve?

He doesn't even have all the engine tin off yet.

It's little premature to be making this call.

A burnt up exhaust valve &amp; seat is pretty common too.

Stay tuned for a burnt tulip , &amp; seat.
