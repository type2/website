Subject: [T2] VW RIGHT SIDE MIRROR FOR BUG (OFF-TOPIC)


&gt; Apologies for the posting here but I'm a Bus man ('71) and type2_dot_com
&gt; member who is helping out a friend with a '67 Convertible Bug on a minor
&gt; project.  I figure that many of you also have another Bug in the garage as
&gt; well for those embarassing moments when something goes wrong with the Bus
&gt; and you need to get to work.  All we want to do is install a right side
&gt; mirror onto the upper hinge on the passenger door.  As you may know, the
&gt; blind spot on the right side for these babies sucks big time and is
&gt; extremely dangerous.
&gt;
&gt; I bought the combined mirror and hinge pin post.  The guy at the FLAPS
&gt; said all we had to do was replace the pin in the existing hinge and
&gt; badabingbadaboom.  But while the door works just fine, the pin in the
&gt; hinge won't budge.  I've sprayed WD-40 on it like holy water and banged
&gt; away from underneath with a big fat punch and a big fat hammer but nothing
&gt; happens at all.  Swallowing my pride, I've gone to a couple of local body
&gt; shops and they tried the same thing with similar results.  I had assumed
&gt; that they would have some sort of fancy pin extractor for other hinge work
&gt; but they just look blank when I describe the tool I think would do the
&gt; job.

You can proly get it out eventually using the punch..  Or find someone with
an &quot;AIR HAMMER &quot; !  I use a moderate duty *snap-on-part # YA9070* air
hammer. Pops it right out, and you don't end up with damage to anything.

I am suprized one of your local shops diden't have one.


&gt; Any suggestions?  This has got to have been done by thousands of other Bug
&gt; junkies over the years and buying the mirror\pin assembly is easy (every
&gt; VW parts store sells them).  So what's wrong with me?  (in respect to
&gt; getting the pin out I mean...)

Nothing ! Your on the right track just keep running.
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
