Subject: in praise of The Bus Depot

I'm writing to publicly thank Ron Salmon for the way The Bus Depot has 
handled a problem I recently encountered.

The Bus Depot mistakenly sent me an improper part, and it was installed 
on my bus before I could prevent it. The installation did some 
significant damage to my bus.

I spoke with Ron about it yesterday. He was genuinely sympathetic and 
he was immediately willing to accept responsibility for the mistake, 
despite a legitimate basis for arguing that the damage was the fault of 
the person who installed the part. That in itself was remarkable, but 
what I consider truly exceptional was his willingness to go way beyond 
what one might normally expect to remedy the situation. I come away 
from this with the sense that given the circumstances Ron has done for 
me as much as I could reasonably expect.

Mistakes happen in any business. What matters is how the business 
responds in the case of a mistake. In this respect The Bus Depot is 
truly a superior operation. Thank you Ron.
