Subject: Re: [T2] can anyone answer me this !

White smoke, sorta resembling steam?

If yes, it is condensation. Normally occurs after you shut off the engine and
it sits overnight. Most mufflers have a little drain hole at the lowest point
to let the water out, to keep the muffler from rusting out.

&gt; when first starting the engine,  in the morning say. there appears to
&gt; be some smoke that comes out of the exhaust, but it only does
&gt; it once when starting up . does anyone have any ideas as to what this
&gt; could be ?
