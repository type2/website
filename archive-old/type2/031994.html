&gt; I seem to recall a Hoover sermon where he was suggesting mounting the
&gt; cooler on the left battery tray, arguing that the overpressure from the
&gt; scoops would keep air flowing OUT through the cooler, and thus not
&gt; pre-heat the enging cooling air.  I think this plan also involved an
&gt; electric fan, which would operate at idle, when there would not be any
&gt; overpressure.

I don't have time right now to review them all, but I'm pretty sure he
referred in various sermons to both arrangements. I've seen various
versions of the cooler in the left tower trick: Cooler in the tower,
cooler over a hole in the bottom of the tower where it vents heated air to
outside but deprives engine compartment of some of its positive pressure
at speed, same deal with a big fan on it to keep driving air at idle
(which is the Bob Hoover solution you refer to). I've seen a number of
buses on the road wiuth a third air scoop low on the driver's side, with
an oil cooler underneath it. Only one I ever inspected up close did not
include a plenum to vent that hot air back out, but I think that would be
ideal. But if (as I do) you have an aux. battery on that side, there's no
room for the oil cooler gizmo at that location. 

&gt; ...building some kind of box/plenum with a flap system to keep air from
&gt; being suck INTO the engine compartment through the cooler.  Or was it
&gt; Hoover who suggested this?  I forget now where that idea came from --
&gt; maybe from my own brain, maybe not.

I've made reference to that solution on this newsgroup in the past (a 
while past) but won't flatter myself that it was my original idea. I met 
a mechanic once who described to me a similar setup he'd built, but the 
bus was not available for inspection.

&gt; This got me thinking: would it be possible to install some kind of
&gt; manual shunt to send the oil to the cooler when the oil temp guage shows
&gt; hot oil?  A couple of ball valves might work; though having two valves
&gt; to operate opens the possibility of accidentally closing the one to the
&gt; cooler but not opening the shunt back to the engine.

Possible? Yes. Less than $50 (cost of an oil thermostat valve) to install? 
Maybe a little. But what would you do? Watch the oil temp gauge, then 
pull over, run back there, throw the switch, hop back in the driver's 
seat and continue? Strikes me as more work and (maybe) only slightly less 
money to invent, manufacture and install a considerably less elegant 
solution. If you're really into saving money and are completely 
regardless of you time, it might be a fun project.

&gt; Anyway, I recommend the junkyard as the source for a fan, if you decide
&gt; to go that route.  There's a nice selection of 'em usually.  :  )

Good idea. I think most radiator fans would do the job more or less well.
