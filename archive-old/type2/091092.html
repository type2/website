&gt; if you are &quot;buying it back&quot; from the insurance company you will probably get

Since this is just a financial transaction with the insurance company, you
still have the same title you've always had.  The check you get from the
insurance company is just smaller since they deducted what they
considered the &quot;salvage value&quot; from the total.
