Subject: Re: [T2] emergency brake broke

Hey Nathan.  Know that on the 74, you don't need to remove the axle nut
to pop off the drum; you'll only need to remove the two bolts you see on
the surface of the drum after removing the tire.  

I had something similar happen to my bus.  There's a anchor pin on a
lever attached to one of the brake shoes; if memory serves me right the
emergency brake cable attaches to that lever.  (I think it serves as a
sort of pivot point for the mechanism between the tensioned cable and
the brake shoe.)  Anyway, on some brake shoes this pin was held in with
a horseshoe clip, which if it works its way off can allow the anchor pin
drop into the drum.  This happened to the right-rear wheel on my van,
and the pin got wedged in there enough somehow to lock it up solid (just
before that it sounded like loose change clanking around in a can).  

Even still, it could be one of a a few things (broken spring, broken
pin, etc.).  Best way to know is to open it up.
