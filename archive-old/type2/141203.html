Subject: Re: [T2] Timing revisited

This is what I was told (or what I remember being told ...it was a few years
ago) by a mechanic who also happened to be an electrical engineer. He proved
it by hooking up several different types of timing lights, 4 if I remember
correctly, to the same running VW engine. The timing was different for all
of them by as much as 2 deg. If someone has a few different timing light,
give it a try and tell us the results.

Joey
