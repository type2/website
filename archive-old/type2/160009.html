Subject: Re: [T2] Windshield seal redux...

OK...So I've measured the circumference of the seal
and it comes out to approx. 8 feet.
The spare windshield measures approx. 11 feet in 
circumference...
Before I break my spare windshield, has anyone got 
a new seal to verify my measurements? I may well
have the wrong seal...Ron, at BD, is this the approx.
size of a new seal for the baywindow Bus...?
It &quot;seems&quot; as if trying to stretch my seal around
my windshield will only snap it in the concave dir-
ection... ?-(
