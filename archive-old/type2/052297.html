&gt;You might also consider posting your question at the 914 Club website
&gt;located at www.dgi_dot_net/914, and/or the 914 BBS located at
&gt;www.pelicanparts_dot_com. Minus the dipstick being on top, a 914 Type 4 should
&gt;work as a great replacement.

No oil fill in stock location is the major annoyance.  You'd need
to use the 914 breather/fill.
