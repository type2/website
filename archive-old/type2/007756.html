&gt; It could also be a bad connection at the starter solenoid.  It would be
worth

&gt; the time to crawl under and clean/inspect the connectors there.  Best to

&gt; disconnect the battery first to prevent sparks.  Also, I'm no expert on FI,

&gt; but there may be other things to look at as well, such as the double relay

&gt; on the (I believe) upper left of the firewall.

One thing I did forget to mention, is that the fuel injection has been
removed, so that can not be blamed for the problem.  I will check the
connection to the selenoid however.

Thanks,

David
