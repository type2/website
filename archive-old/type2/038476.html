All this talk of AC...  You should be REAL mean and take it out for good.  A
true Type2 owner either has the ice box filled with Gatorade (summer) or is
breathing exhaust fumes for heat (winter).

&gt; I posted last weekend that I am preparing for my first engine pull on my

&gt; Here's the problem.  The bolts for the bracket that carries the rear
engine
&gt; support bar is only 1 inch away from the AC compressor.  Do I have to
remove
&gt; the compressor to pull the engine or is it possible to remove the bolts
that
&gt; go through the support bar instead of the ones that attach the bracket to
&gt; the frame?  Is this clear, it's hard to put the description in text.  Has
&gt; anyone removed a late model, type 4, AC equipped engine before?

I had AC on mine and did remove the engine with it attached before I got
around to removing the dead AC unit.... I took (and still) take the
support bar loose from the frame on either side and leave it attached to
the engine.  sometimes gets in the way but also makes a great handle too
