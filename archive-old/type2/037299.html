Subject: 1972 Kombi for Sale

Folks,

I have a recently acquired 72 Kombi for sale.


It is in GREAT shape, very little rust, needs paint and dent work.
New dual Webers. All seats are there and in very good shape.

I'm Asking $2650.00 for the Kombi. Comes with some spare parts.


I am located in Somersworth, NH. This is one hour North East of Boston.
Exit 9 off of Rte 16 (Spaulding Turnpike). My street address is 16 Green
Street.
&gt;I need to move these as I am Moving to Italy in October.

&gt;
&gt;I will try to take pictures of the Kombi. It is actually a 71 built after
&gt;August, so it has a 1700cc in GOOD shape. New Dual Webers, 009, clean
&gt;engine. The Seats are all there and not ripped. It is a walkthrough. It has
&gt;a small hole in the nose, not from rust, but from the tailgate of a large
&gt;truck. Probably about 2&quot;. Spare is mounted on nose (not for long.) Middle
&gt;seat was stored and is in New condition. Rear seat in good condition. I
have
&gt;a zbed for it if you are interested. Rockers have some surface, but do not
&gt;need replacing. Beam is good. Windshield needs new seal, but NO rust. This
&gt;is a nice vehicle. I have all records since early 70's and know the history
&gt;of the bus. Came from California, owned by elderly man and wife. Stored in
&gt;winters. Lights horn and directionals all work. Color gold, original paint.
&gt;Chalky, but may rub out.
&gt;
&gt;That's all I can think of...
&gt;Should have pictures this weekend.
&gt;
