Subject: blue smoke:new theory

The '67 has been on the DI list for about 3 months now.

It was running fine after I sorted out the 34pict problem but I set 
the valves changed the oil and jeez....what a mess. I took it for a 
test drive and it ran great for a few miles and then a huge plume of 
blue smoke emerged as I took a hard right turn.The cloud of smoke 
followed me for about a half a mile and subsided only to return again 
at the next turn.

I was stunned and embarrassed as I pulled into the driveway. I jumped 
out and checked the motor. It was fine so I turned it back on and let 
it idle as I went around back to look things over. Puffs of blue from 
the tailpipe! I shut it down and went back to the motor. I put my 
finger in the tailpipe and it emerged black and oily.  Several folks 
suggested I at least had a leaky valve cover gasket and oil in the 
was sloshing past the gasket and getting on the heater box. That 
turned out to be true but did not explain the oily tail pipe. Other 
suggested a badly worn or broken piston ring which seemed likely. 
Finally the loose valve guide theory emerged.

Subsequent road test still resulted in a smokey tailpipe but not as 
bad. Since motor would occasionally smoke at startup I figured at 
least the rings were bad. The motor at least 70 k on  it without a 
rebuild so it is time. The bus was parked and  the newly purchased 
Westy was pressed into daily driver service.

Jump ahead to last Saturday.

To cap off a day of yard work I decided to move the bus out of the 
driveway so I could sweep. I also was going to drive it the following 
day to swap the motor out for the 1600 sp spare that was out on loan 
to another club member. At least a partial teardown was in order to 
find the cause and fix it. Happily the bus roared to life without 
much fanfare after not running for three months. No smoke either. 
There was a fair but not substantial oil stain where it had been 
parked. I checked the oil level and it was just below the upper mark.

Feeling dangerous I decided to drive it on a 30 mile round trip to 
check out a bus that John was trying to get back on the road. I was 
shocked when not even a hint of a blue puff appeared. On Sunday the 
bus did another 20 or so miles to retrieve the 1600 sp motor. Today I 
put about 40 miles on the bus and not a puff out of the tail pipe. In 
fact the bus is running like a top!!!! It seems to run better than it 
ever did :)

New theory: I put too much oil in the motor. Perhaps and extra cup or 
so. When I made that first turn I sloshed it way past worn rings into 
the heads and ultimately it sumped into the muffler. When the muffler 
got hot it smoked. Also leaky valve cover gasket caused oil so smoke 
off the heater boxes.

For now I will baby the bus around town. The engine swap will still 
happen as the 1600 dp should be torn down anyway.
