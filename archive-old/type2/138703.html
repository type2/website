&gt;From: john kolak

&gt;Well congratulations! Do we get to know what the job is? How soon do
&gt;you have to start?

&gt;Good luck,

Well it is for a civil construction company, excavation, grading, utilities, 
paving, etc . The title would be Project Manager. I should be down there by 
Nov. 29. The boss and I are still dancing but I have accepted the job. We 
just have to finish working out the details. The money is there but we are 
still dancing with relocation costs against his head hunter's fee. It is 
pretty excitng although I have to clean up my act just a little. Moving from 
a $5 Million/year company to a $200 Million/year company does require a bit 
change. But the change in the Paycheck and Benefits are a very welcome 
change. ;) Now I might be able to pay my wife to work on the next VW we get. 
HEHEHEHEHE.

Thanks,

Michael Knight
