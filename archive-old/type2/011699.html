Subject: engine knock
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I decided to take the 79' out for a cruise 5-minutes
later the knock was gone. It still disturbes me
thought. I guess im just used to the quit operation of
my golf. I do remember though my 88' jetta gli being
quite noisy when it sat for awhile or it was real
cold. Anyway, thanks for the info y'all, Im going to
do the disconnect the spark plug while knocking
procedure. And make shure everything is adjusted to
bently spec.

Thanks
CHADMAN
