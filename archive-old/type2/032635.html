&gt;The mechanics who rebuilt my engine (a reputable shop) told me 3/4 turn.
&gt;
&gt;I tried them at 2 turns and it would barely run, and when I put them back at
&gt;3/4 it runs fine.

This is another F.A.R.T. that could be researched in the archives at
http://vw.i405_dot_com.  Personally I prefer 3/4 turn, as I would rather have
the valves be too loose than too tight.
