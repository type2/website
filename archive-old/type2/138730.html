Subject: Re: [T2] Road Trip

I recommend I40. I'm in Flagstaff Arizona. Texas is nearly flat. New Mexico 
is almost flat. Arizona is a gentle grade from about 3000ft at the eastern 
border to about 7000ft in Flagstaff. then everything to the west of here is 
down hill. I'm not sure if I intended that pun or not? Make sure you have 
snow chains. We ocasionaly get some nasty snow/ice this time of year. It's 
supposed to get down to 2 deg f tonight.

Enjoy
Tom

&gt; Im sure many of you have done some cross-country trips in your busses. 
&gt; Any
&gt; route suggestions (Mass to Cali)?  And how long did your trip take?  Is 15
&gt; days too little time?  THANKS!
