&gt;John:
&gt;
&gt;As I currently installing a K-jet, could you please explain the single
vent thing
&gt;some more to me?  I noticed a nice 3/8&quot; nipple connected to the charcoal
canister
&gt;in the engine compartment.  Is this the vent?  Cause when I removed the
tank a few

NO you can NOT use the vent in the compartment as is with FI as the
hoses connecting it to the tank are merely slip fittings and 20+ year old
hose.  Even though it is return with &quot;no pressure&quot; I wouldn't use em as is.
'72-'79 as I recall which has been some years have one breather on each
side of the tank, connected by short hoses to steel tubes that run up the
gravity check valves in the rear pillars, with another short piece of tube
there somewhere.  I mean one could attach return DIRECTLY TO THE
TANK to one of the vents.  You need a tank vent functioning though or
you get into problems.  Even removing one of them may make for some
issues at a real tilt of the tank.  In these buses, the FI ones at least the
tubes off the check valves come down to a T that is always gone in the
center and that goes to the charcoal canister on the firewall or rear pillar.

'68-'71 has a single vent centrally, short piece of hose to a steel tube
that went over and dumped out near the gas fill as far as I can remember,
I pulled one of those just 3-4 years ago.  I've never seen a charcoal canister
in a '68-'71 someone has told me they exist but I got no idea what they
hooked to.

I should have been clear about this in the beginning, it is just really a
&quot;thought&quot; excercise anyway as modifying your emissions system is illegal
of course.  The little sub tank is a swift thought like I mentioned but it
seems
to me they were a bit pricey.  Might see if Jegs or somebody sells
something for american circle track or whatever.
