Pete,

Joe here in Boulder Colorado. Don't take the shroud apart! You will find no
bolt to unscrew. This bolt you see from the outside is a stud VW farmed out
this one so ( N 014 443 12 STUD AM 8A X 30) is what they call it. You need
to extract this by threading two nuts onto the stud, tightening them
together and try to back it out. If not then you can try and us an easy out
to get it out. If you have trouble with finding this metric stud, then give
me a call I'll get you one. Also I have the brackets as well. Give us a call
if you need any help and or are in the area.

Subject: [T2] Fan Shroud/Alternator Q?


Yes, it's me, Alabama Pete, back on the list again
from an extended hiatus.  I'm still in Colorado
driving my '78 baby.  Hello to new and old friends
alike.

Anyway, I started what I thought was going to be a
routine alternator swap yesterday, to find out both of
the brackets where broken.  The lower pivot bracket
was competely broken and the adjustment bracket was
cracked.  The kicker is where the adjustment bracket
attaches to the fan/cooling shroud.  The nut holding
the adj. bracket to the shroud had loosened about half
way and the bracket had eaten a third of the bolt
away.  So I've got to replace the bolt, from the
inside of the fan shroud.  Is this a standard bolt?
Can I simply pull the back half (back is back) of the
shroud off and get to said bolt?

Any and all tips, suggestions, anecdotes welcome...

Alabama Pete in Colorado
