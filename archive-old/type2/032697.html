Subject: valve cover leaks

Volks,

 Ive never seen this problem posted. Im having trouble sealing my valve cover 
on one side, I first thought I had pushrod tube leaks  but its the valve 
cover and It pours out.
 The cover is not bent and I have made absolutely sure Ive got a square seal 
and gasket in place. My next plan is to double up the gasket but b4 I do I 
was wondering if anyone else has had and rectified my problem.

 Thanks,
  David
