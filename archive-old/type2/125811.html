Subject: Tow hitch by Gibbes Machine

Looking for a tow hitch made by Gibbes Machine Co -- background:

Sometime around 19751 I was forced to scrap a 63-ish Microbus because of 
pathological rust/salt damage.  Sad task indeed, but many of its parts went to 
good homes.  The Microbus had a great tow hitch that, according to sticker, was 
made by the Gibbes Machine Co. in Columbia, South Carolina.  I kept the hitch 
but damaged it recently, so wonder if there is any way of finding another one?

The hitch is made (mostly) from 1 1/2&quot; x 1/2&quot; rectangular solid steel bar.  
Viewed from above, it looks something like a capital A where the bottoms of the 
A have been formed to clamp over the torsion tube, and the top of the A is of 
course where the tow ball is located.  The horizontal line in the A is angle 
stock.

If anyone can help me locate a decent Gibbes tow hitch, I would be very 
interested... thanks in advance.  Glenn
