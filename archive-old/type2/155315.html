Subject: Shift Rod Front Bushing

I apparently have a misalignment problem as I go
through a lot of these front bushings - about two a
year, average. My bus takes the style that are like a
grommet in the manner in which they mount.

Today I bought a replacement and was sold a bug one
and told it works in place of the bus one. Has anyone
else done this? It sure looks a lot beefier than the
bus one!

BTW - I have been getting more tranny noise into the
cabin the past week or two and was fretting over what
would be causing these new noises! This morning it
occurred to me that it was probably just that
four-month-old bushing worn out and the rod is running
metal to metal and transmitting more noise. I haven't
crawled under to check yet, but I'm confident that is
the cause! -BaH
