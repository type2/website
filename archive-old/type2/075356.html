Subject: re: Bus woes

Hi Dan,

you have a classic case of CITS.

What the heck is CITS, you ask?

&quot;Crud In Tank Syndrome&quot;, says I.

Check the fuel filter, it probably needs to be changed. It's possible you
will also need to remove the fuel tank and flush out the crud, but check the
filter first, and if you do need to replace it buy two, as you will likely
be doing it again soon.

Happy trails,

&gt; Greetings List,
&gt; Here is the situation: Took the Bus (78) to get emissions today and the =
&gt; guy said he couldn't get it to high enough RPM's, it kept &quot;spurting&quot;. He =
&gt; says he thinks the fuel system is dirty and I should change the filter =
&gt; and add a fuel additive to clean it. So I begin to drive it home and it =
&gt; doesn't make it. It starts fine, and idles fine, but when i accelerate =
&gt; it lurches back and forth and sputters as if the fuel supply is being =
&gt; interrupted. Had to park it and walk home. What do you think the problem =
&gt; is? Note that this bus sat in a field for 5 years and I haven't done =
&gt; anything to the fuel system yet. I've driven about 70 miles since I got =
&gt; it and it ran fine until now.
