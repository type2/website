&gt; I am contemplating an additional purchase.  1976 Westy.  My question is
&gt; this, it is automatic.  I am accustomed to the stick shift, and wanted your
&gt; thoughts on the advantages or disadvantages of either.

I have a 78 auto tranny bus and have had this one for 8 years or so.

the advantages

great for city driving
hard to over or under rev
later ones 75+ are pretty reliable

biggest disadvantage I have found

you can't drift start em, make sure your battery and starter work!
