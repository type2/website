&gt; &gt;  Remove the starter. You may have incorrectly identified the &quot;4th bolt&quot;.
&gt; &gt;If the starter is removed, then you found it. You also won't be happy
&gt; &gt;when those scissors jacks fall over. Put a block between them to
&gt; &gt;catch the engine when they do.

&gt; I took the (bottom) bolt off to remove the starter, so it's hanging on top
&gt; of the tranny now.  But the engine still feels connected to something on
the
&gt; top.  I can wiggle the bottom, but when I wiggle and pull, the top stays
&gt; connected ... it just feels like theres something up there keeping it in.

Ezackly. It is now unclear that you have indeed removed the starter.
The upper starter nut is removed from the engine bay.
This nut fastens a D-shaped bolt which fits a notch in the starter.
The bolt joins the starter, trans, and engine at the top.
Remove the starter.
