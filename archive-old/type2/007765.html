Subject: push rod tube seals
Date: Wed, 18 Nov 1998 08:19:18 PST

My push rod tube seals leak on my '78 2.0 litre. Is this a problem or an 
inconvenience. Can it cause other problems? I read something about oil 
getting into the heater boxes, can this happen? I'm not worried about 
feeding my bus oil if the leak wont effect anything. THanks for any 
advice.
