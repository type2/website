Heidi and I took the Appalachian Highway back to Chattanooga. About the same
distance, time-wise, as I-40 to I-75, but a heck of a lot nicer. I won't
bother with the old route again. Except for the areas through the Nanatahala
National Forest and the Cherokee National Forest, it was all split 4-lanes
with almost no stop lights. The view was much, much nicer. We skipped the Blue
Ridge Parkway this time and opted for a funyak trip down the Tuskagesee.

Pizza at Mellow Mushrooms before leaving Asheville was nice too. Too bad we
didn't have any company at our table for eight... I'm going to have head back
up that way and explore some more. Maybe grad school at UNC-A...

-Eric
