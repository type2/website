&gt; 1. why would my mechanic put a 009
&gt; in?

Because they put in new parts and the vacuum dizzy wasn't available new
until recently. Concidentally, the 009 is now out of production and is
drying up.

&gt; 2.  why are they so popular?

Because the timing characteristic makes people feel like there is a surge of
power.

&gt; 3. is there anything i cant do to correct
&gt; the inherent problems w/ 009's?  all in all, my bus runs better than it did
&gt; but i do notice its power is weak until rpms are real high(when i should be
&gt; shifting).  the 050 vac adv dizzy gave me more power it seems through all
&gt; rpm ranges but couldnt hold idle(plate was bad).  im confused as to why
&gt; 009's are so often used.

Simply because it's a new part.

&gt; one last thing,  since ive owned the bus, after being driven a little and i
&gt; stop at the store or something, when i come back out, the bus is reluctant
&gt; to start.  it always starts though with some effort.  is this normal?  even
&gt; with brand new dizzy?

Could be the hot start issue or fuel vapor lock.
