&gt;There's a rough-looking stretch splitty out of Phoenix
&gt;(I think) with white primer on it. I believe it had a
&gt;mid-mounted Chevy small block power-plant and *lots*
&gt;of shag carpet inside!!!
&gt;
&gt;It's actually pretty cool. I've seen it at the
&gt;Prescott, Az. Flat Four Fetish show (which occurs
&gt;again, next weekend). It might be there again, so look
&gt;for it at the street-show if you go.

Isn't that guy's name Kyle?  If so I feel two threads converging.  :-)
Anyway, I saw this bus at Jerome two years ago and again at Busses by the
Bridge earlier this year.  It has a big block V8 in it and a solid rear
axle.  I wouldn't really classify it as &quot;rough&quot;, I thought it was pretty
straight.  Has two small pop tops.  Most of the extra interior room is
taken up by the engine compartment, but it does make a good party table.
The one thing I dislike about it is the cooling ductwork which hangs down
really low in the middle of the bus.  Very cool ride though, as is the
Vanagon at http://www.evcl_dot_com/vw/.  Thanks to whoever posted that URL!  I
dream of building a stretch baywindow highroof someday, but it will take
deeper pockets and garage than I have presently.
