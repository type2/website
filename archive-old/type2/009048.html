&gt; I've just pulled the 1776 from my '71 Westy for the third time in
twelve
&gt; months.  It was really gratifying to see that the only evidence of
oil on
&gt; the outside of the engine was a bit coming from one of my push rod
tube
&gt; doughnuts.  Everything else was dry.
&gt; 
&gt; However:  The tube on the oil filler pipe is plumbed into the intake
tube
&gt; on one of the Kadrons.  Every time I have taken apart the engine, 
this
&gt; pathway has been soaked with oil.  I now recall that the PO had a
home made
&gt; 1liter plastic bottle hanging in this path,  I now know to accumulate
&gt; liquid and pass on vapors.
&gt; 
&gt; My question:  What is the source of this oil and why is there so
much of
&gt; it?  My understanding of blowby does not jibe with this oil problem.
 This
&gt; is perhaps my tenth ac rebuild but my first non stock one. I've not
had
&gt; this problem before.  The previous rebuild went well but a quart of
oil
&gt; vanished in 100 miles.  Might be related to this.
&gt; 
&gt; Is the liquid oil slung up there?  If so, I thought that the louvered
&gt; gasket was to prevent this slinging.
&gt; 
&gt; Is oil vapor, perhaps generated in the sump by too high temperatures
making
&gt; its way into this tube?

Conditions inside the crankcase of a running engine can be described
as a maelstrom of oil droplets suspended in air.  Oil is atomized by
the rapidly moving parts.  If any of this air moves out of the engine,
the oil vapor will go with it.  Some of this oil will condense in the
plumbing, causing the mess you describe.  The oil filler serves as a
crude oil separator, but obviously some oil vapor still escapes.  In
some engines, the oil is delivered directly to the intake manifold, so
you never see it, but the VW runs it to the air cleaner where you do.
