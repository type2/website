Subject: Type I engine or not?

&gt;The Type 1s always had to be changed.
&gt;
&gt;I'd rather convert with a watercooled Audi engine than going back to a 
Type
&gt;1 - and I really love the aircooled way to drive.
&gt;
I have said this before and I am saying it again, Type I's are not that 
bad, and dont need constant replacing.
My 63 is nearing 80,000 miles on its motor a type 1 that has had a long 
hard life. It sat outside in the rain for 2 years before I got around to 
using it, and even then it had pushed around a 1969 westy for 45,000 
miles. It still has great compression.
Case in point: My friends 69 went 200,000 miles on the original factory 
motor before replacement. Another friend has a 73 that had a 1600 type 1 
in a work vehicle, hauled VW parts all day and still does, that is 
pushing 250,000 miles. They can and will last.
