Subject: Click...Click Update OR additional advice needed

Hello all,

First I would like to that those of you who offered you help and advice.
So, thank you!

Well, I got in the Bus this afternoon and tried to start it just to see what
would happen.  Am I the only one who does this?  And, of course, she starts
right up.  I made the mistake of turning her off and that was it.  No go on
additional attempts.   then checked the connections and they all appeared to
be good, but I tightened them all anyway.  No help there.  Taking a deep
breath I decided to go ahead and swap the starter with the one from my other
'76 (for sale by the way).  At this point I was in a hurry.  It was getting
dark and I have to get to work tomorrow....  My question:  How the heck do
you get that thing out of there???  I was doing o.k. until trying to get at
the upper bolt mounting the starter to the tranny.  I could manage to touch
it if I contorted myself, but I can't imagine getting a tool up there to
take it off.  Any suggestions?  Sorry if I got a bit long winded....

Bruised knuckles,
Rob
