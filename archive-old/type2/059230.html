Subject: Camber &amp; tow settings...

Someone mentioned camber and tow settings.  The last time I took my '73 Westphalia to the
shop to have the settings checked, they told me that the bus was too old for them to have
the settings on record.  I am assuming that a camper, with its extra weight, has different
settings than a standard loaf of the same year.  Does anyone know what the settings for a
'73 camper are?  I'll write them down and confound the guys at Les Schwab next time...

THX,
