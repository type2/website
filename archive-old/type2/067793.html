Thanks for the note David... I might have another source for the ducting 
you're looking for.  I also inherited a &quot;parter&quot; 72 when I bought 
Folly... I'm not sure that ducting is there, but I'll have a look for 
ya.  Trouble is that parter is about 50 Km away from me.   Maybe this 
weekend though!

I've had many replies on the engine tin... thanks for the note.

Barry
