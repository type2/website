Subject: How to measure piston length??
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.OSF.3.91.990331135246.4657A-100000_at_Sherlock.SIMS.Berkeley.EDU&gt;

Hi all:

In preparation for putting the 2 Vanagon 2.0L engines I'm rebuilding back 
together I determined the long/short connecting rods by putting 3 at a 
time on a piston pin and comparing one to the other.

The differences seemed pretty minor but, a foolish consistency being the 
hobgoblin of little minds, I thought I'd also try and determine the 
long/short pistons, to match up with the short/long rods.  But, I can't 
quite figure out how to do it!

My first thought was to put each piston top-down on a piece of plate 
glass I have, push the piston pin out of the piston a little ways, and 
then measure the difference between the top of the piston and the top of 
the pin with my inside micrometer.  But, this distance is shorter than 
the shortest measurement I can make with the micrometer.

So how does one go about measuring the length of a piston?  Actually, I 
don't need to know absolute length, just relative length.

TIA.
