&gt; The fall of the dollar also has a lot to do with it. Everything imported is

&gt; Most indications are that this will only get worse over the near future. If
&gt; you need any imported parts (and most VW parts are, of course, imported), I
&gt; _strongly_ advise you to stock up now, because huge price increases,
&gt; industry wide, are almost a certainty. This is not a come-on but an honest
&gt; assessment of the current market. Everything I'm reordering is costing me
&gt; 10-25% more because of the dollar's fall, and every other importer's seeing
&gt; the same thing. Prices on many parts are going to skyrocket.

This is good advice. I deal with CDN currency conversions all the time and
it really hurts right now. Right after the election it just went zoom.

&gt; Meanwhile, if the Bugpack kit that Richard mentioned is good quality (and I
&gt; don't sell Bugpack so I have no idea) and is a few bucks cheaper, by all
&gt; means buy it. Or make your own. On the other hand, even at $19 the Bosch
&gt; still has some advantages: It's a very safe bet quality wise, it comes with
&gt; instructions, and is easily obtained.

Just throwing out options. For the record, I bought my WR1 at Bus Depot.
