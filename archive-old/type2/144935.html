Subject: Friday: nuts and bolts?

All,

At work, I am setting up a workshop for mechanical
engineering students to do their projects in.  We have the
usual assortment of random nuts and bolts left over from
previous projects, but I'd like to get a big stock of the
common stuff (inch and metric) in the shop.  I know what
sizes I want and I could just go buy them, but I'd like to
get them all at once if I can.  I've found small
assortments at the FLAPS and hardware store, but these
aren't nearly big enough - I'm thinking of something that
costs a couple of hundred dollars and takes two guys to
lift.  If it comes with storage bins, bonus.  Anybody got
a good source for something like this?

ObBus: I will of course ensure that the assortment has the
right diameters and pitches to fit my '64, for those &quot;I
just snapped it off and it's 21:00 on Sunday&quot; moments.

Matt Roberds
