Hello,

I can buy a '80 Transporter (T3) 2.0 running on LPG. I didn't see it yet,
but it sounds not too bad, and very cheap.
One of its probles is, that one rear spring is broken.
I don't have any experience on cars as 'modern' as this one, so can anybody
tell me how much work it is to replace the rear spring and shock of a '80
Transporter?

Do later (watercooled) Vanagons have the same springs and shocks? This
would make it much easier to find parts at a junkyard.

(please p-mail me at jzeemans_at_goudappel.nl, as I'm in digest mode)
