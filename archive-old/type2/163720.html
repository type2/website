&gt; Be careful with this idea Mike, et al; had a friend who did it, and melted
&gt; the blowers in about 10 minutes, because they are only plastic bodied. He
&gt; melted the fan blades too. It really stunk. The heat coming out of the
&gt; exchangers is really hot!, enough to melt plastic. He said if he did this
&gt; again, he would NOT have done it so they were &quot;pulling&quot; or sucking the heat
&gt; out of the exchangers, instead he would have mounted them BEFORE the
&gt; exchangers so they &quot;pushed&quot; or blew through them. We have the single
&gt; squirrel cage fan in the engine compartment; his thought was to put one of
&gt; these high volume beasts on each side, pushing huge amounts of air through
&gt; the exchangers, and keeping the blowers on the cold side of them. Does that
&gt; make sense??

I did this on a '71 with a Chevy Blazer three speed fan mounted in the spare
tire well and blowing thru' the heat exchangers...With an upright engine, I
capped the outlets on the doghouse and used the engine fan to just cool the
engine...Sucking air in from the interior and recyclin' it got the inside of 
the
Bus hot! Hot enough to actually melt ice on the windshield with the defrost-
ers... ;-)
Loud tho'... :-(
