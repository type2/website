&gt; To do a first class job, you need the front lower cylinder  tin from a 72-74
&gt; or better yet from a 79, the underneath covers for the cylinders, and the two
&gt; rear heat exchanger hangers (the right one of which also is the alternator
&gt; adjusting bracket)
&gt; Seems like one time I did it I just welded something onto the end of the
&gt; alternator bracket. The 72-74 right lower cylinder tin has a hole to transfer
&gt; some warmed cooling air back up to the carbs through the air cleaner. Your 78
&gt; has injection so obviously does not need the warm air for the carbs. The 79
&gt; piece is exactly what you need. If you find a 72-74 piece, you should weld up
&gt; the hole.
