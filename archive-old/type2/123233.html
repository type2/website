Subject: Re: [T2] door handles

&gt; A crazy thing has happened to my 71 Weekender. Suddenly neither the driver nor passenger door will open from the inside. Admittedly I only open the passenger door very infrequently from the inside. The driver door became disabled over a period of a few days, then I noticed the passenger side having the same problem. Both will open readily from the outside. As yet I have done nothing due to time constraints, but when I pull the door panels off, what should I look for ?  It's a bit awkward to roll down the window to open my door from the outside. Suggestions?

See if the door opens with the panel off (mine did).

Bentley says to bend the actuating rod a little bit so it's got a slightly 
shorter &quot;throw&quot;.  Basically, so when you pull the handle, you have to move 
it a shorter distance to acutate the lock mechanism.
