Subject: Sliding windows, removal of
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.05.10012132036331.15430-100000_at_mtolympus.ari_dot_net&gt;

Volks,

OK, first the sliding windows were standard on '78 and '79 buses only.  If
you see a set in a junk yard, the procedure for removal is the same as any
other glass.  Note that if you practice and screw up on the rear quarter
windows, no one will care (I have never heard of anyone breaking or
replacing these, tho there is probably at least one person out there...
:-)

Take a nozzle bottle (like for dishwashing detergent) and fill it with a
fairly strong soap solution.  Bottle in one hand and butter knife or putty
knife in the other, go completely around the rubber gasket, lifting it and
giving a squirt of soap solution.  Start at the bottom, as it is easier to
squirt up with full bottle. once you have lubed the glass groove
thoroughly (neatness does *not* count here! :-), lay on your back on the
center seat or floor and place your feet (in flat-bottom shoes or boots)
in the upper corner of the window fixed pane. Space your feet about 9
inches apart.  Press out, gently but firmly, and the window will pop out.  
Oh, did I mention it is a good idea to have someone outside the bus to
catch it? :-)

If you are a bit paranoid, you can go by the goodwill and pick up 10 or so
butter knives, insert them in the groove at 3 inch intervals, and pry
the rubber down to ease starting.
