Subject: Re: [T2] dwell went south

&gt; After my weekend valve adjustment and tune-up my points went south
&gt; this morning.  The bus started to chug alot and a quick check with the
&gt; dwell meter gave an erratically low reading between 11-21 degrees.
&gt;
&gt; I took the points out and notice a big pit so I filed them flat and
&gt; put them back in. Now the dwell is back to normal.  Why did this
&gt; happen?  The adjustment screw wasn't loose.

The general case here is that your condensor is going south.  Bad
condensors burn points and material transfer is a good sign of this.

&gt; Something else I'll pass along: on the first try dwell was set to 54
&gt; so I thought I'd take it for a drive and see what the results were.
&gt; Well, no low end acceleration power but once the RPMs increased
&gt; sufficiently accelerating within the crusing range was no problem. I
&gt; believe the list advice that 49-51 degrees is optimal.  The night
&gt; before when it was 50 was great.

Gee, Richard, where did you learn this? :-)  Yeah, I am tighter than
Bentley when I give advice.  It may well take a few more trial-and-error
adjustments, but 49-51 performs better than the Bentley/VW spec.  I don't
know why the FI buses are so sensitive, but it is certain that they are!

&gt; Question: if I file the points flat is this the same as new points
&gt; (any value over 50 degrees per Bentley is out of spec).

If you *can* file the points flat, then it is the same as new points, yes.
But if you can file the points flat without damaging the file, I want the
name of the company that made the file!!!!  Most points since the 60s are
made of tungsten and are HARD!!!!  Filing is difficult and you will wear
out $10 files filing $3 points.  Can be done, not worth doing.
