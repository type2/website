&gt;BTW, the big hose off the crankcase rebreather back to the air intake has

&gt;Could this be the real source of my problem? It's been like that for 
&gt;25,000 miles and this seems like a recent problem, so I'm skeptical that 
&gt;the old hose is the cause of the new symptom. But it would be easy enough 
&gt;(I guess) to find stiffer hose of the same diameter and swap it out. That 
&gt;rebreather hose is supposed to handle any crankcase fumes and ought to 
&gt;deal with blowby up to a point. It's easy to imagine the kink might be 
&gt;obstructing the return flow.
&gt;
&gt;Anyone had troubles like these before? Anyone got any insight here? 

I've always had blowby-type problems with type IV engines.  Not serious
ones, but I've always had a slight oil leak at the breather box (still
can't tell where it's coming from) and a small amount of oil gets blown
through the breather hose onto my air filter, and I have to change it more
often because of that.  I was considering designing a catch tank to trap
the oil before it gets blown into the air filter housing, but I've recently
acquired a set of heads with breather ports in the valve cover area, which
I'm hoping will relieve enough pressure that I won't have the problem with
the breather box anymore.  I've had this problem even with a freshly
rebuilt motor.  Before the new heads go on, I am planning on installing
valve stem seals which I hope will also help.  In your case, I would fix
the kink in the hose before jumping to any conclusions, because you
definately need an unobstructed path out of the breather box.
