Subject: Questions? And CarFax

Hey guys, first things first... I found a link to a free CarFax report.

http://www.fox5dc_dot_com/news/newslinks.shtml

Don't know if it will be valid after 2/17/2004.

I ran it on my 87 Fiero... I wanted to run it on my VW Bus, but
apparently it only lets you do one (per IP I suppose). So use it wisely.


My questions were..

1 - I was replacing my turn signal lenses in the front (73 Bus). I got
some REALLY nice amber colored ones shipped from Brazil. They are not
original Hellas, but my originals.. well, they WERE originals. They were
soo trashed and cracked and faded that anything would have been better.
Never the less, I removed them and discovered that there are TWO light
bulbs in each turn signal. There is the regular LARGE bulb, that serves
both as a turn signal light, as well as the parking light... and then
there's a little small lightbulb that sits on the side. I put a lightbulb
in there and it doesn't seem to do anything. Can anyone tell me what the
SMALL light bulbs are for? Are they for the turn signal, parking, what?
My wiring may be messed up, because they didn't turn on.

2 - Is it important to have the BOTTOM tin pieces in the engine
compartment? I'm going through my whole motor and am installing the flap
kit I bought from BustedBus (thanks!). The two tin pieces I am talking
about are the large ones that go on the VERY BOTTOM of the engine, not
the small ones that go above the pushrod tubes.


Thanks!!!

Todd
