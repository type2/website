hi
this is my first time posting on  the list, i have been 
lurking for 4 days, but now need some info.  I have just 
bought my first van two weeks ago, i knew it needed work on 
the engine when i got it, but problems have struck already, 
it's a 75 camper, with 1800 engine, i have not had chance to 
even examine it properly but i now  need to learn fast:

the problem is that i have been told i need a new &quot;air 
intake elbow&quot; but can't seem to find this part anywhere.  I 
thought i was perhaps calling the part by a wrong name but  
I saw this part refered to in a posting yesterday,

&gt;contemplating the stock dual carb preheated air intake, in 
whichthere is a elbow macaroni shaped piece of tin that 
draws warm air from
&gt;below the #1 cylinder and connects to the top front tin on 
&gt;the right
&gt;side of the engine compartment.  

 so if i am using the right name, any ideas where i can get 
a new part?  i am London, UK, based and have tried Just 
Kampers but they suggested another name for my broken part   
&quot;warm air intake tin'  but did not have any in stock.

any advice appreciated i need to know the right name, and 
how i can find a replacement.  thanks a million for any info 
you can provide.
