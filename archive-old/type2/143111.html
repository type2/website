Subject: Re: [T2] Just brought home my 77 Westy!!

But they are SO tucked away in there, it's brutal looking. I'm used to doing

&gt; Type 1 valves, but compared to the Bay, they look easy??
&gt;

I don't know about you, but a valve adjustment is a 10 minute procedure for
me. It's all right there between the HE and the tin. Access is a breeze... I
also did Troy's DC in 10 minutes once and it was just as easy to get to.
