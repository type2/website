Subject: Re: [T2] Subject: Modern Brake Switch


When I get a tailgaiter who refuses to pass me I simply slow down to
somewhere around 15 mph below speed limit. This really frustrates them and
they then figure out some creative way to pass me. Sometimes it is even by
moving left and  into the passing lane...

Several lifetimes ago, when I was driving trucks for Ma Bell, I found a
simple solution for dealing with tailgating drivers [especially on the
freeway].  Works just fine with your VW bus, too, and no modifications to
the vehicle are needed.

Pull out the 4-way/emergency flasher switch and let it cycle 2 or 3 times.
The offending party invariably backs off smartly, apparently perceiving the
flashing lights as brake lights.

If he/she returns to harass your bumper, repeat the procedure but try to
randomize the flashes by manipulating the switch.  Be creative, it's your
life and property that are threatened by that insensitive, unthinking,
jerk.

&quot;Modern&quot; drivers are programmed to reduce speed and pay attention [albeit
briefly] in response to flashing lights in their face.  It's a classic
involuntary response [Pavlov's dog comes to mind].  Feel free to manipulate
that response to your advantage.

&gt;&gt;The deficiency here is not in the design of the bus, it's with the driver
of the vehicle following. There are very few things one can do to a bus to
rectify the problem in someone else's vehicle.&lt;&lt;
