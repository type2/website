Regarding the Alternator question earlier. . .
It was my fault for not explaining what year my bus was and what type of
motor I had. SORRY. . . 
Maggie is a 1970 Bus with a 1776 motor. She needs a new alternator, the old
one is the Motorola type. I was thinking of getting one from my local
FLAPS, but since my motor isn't stock, I've had to &quot;make up&quot; years between
the bus and bug's parts to fit things into my aftermarket motor. So I need
an alternator, I ask for a 70-something from a bug, probably late model,
and preferebly something internally regulated. Does anyone know exactly
what year bugs came with internally regualted alterators? Were they in the
late model cabrio's only?

Thanks.
