&gt;Ain't that the truth! Always prepare for the unexpected. In my case, the
&gt;concrete floor gave in under the (stock) jack and the jack sunk into the
&gt;ground. Fortunately I had just crawled out from under the bus to
&gt;pick up the phone.

Thank God your alright! The odds that a phone call would come in time to
save your life are, well I'm sure you figured it out... Better make good use
of your second life 8) Oh yea, thanks for the tip!
