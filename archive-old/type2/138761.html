Subject: Vanagon hydraulic clutch questions &amp; engine install

Been working on installing my engine for the last few hours and getting
nowhere. :~(
This is a 1980 Vanagon. Had the engine in place and could tell the trans.
input shaft had entered the clutch disk but didn't seat into the pilot
bearing. Wiggled and jiggled and pushed things around but it just wouldn't go
together. lowered the engine to survey the situation. The disk is centered and
all looks wall except the throwout bearing was in the depressed position as if
someone was pressing the clutch pedal down. I pushed up on the lever that is
moved by the slave cylinder and the lever moved up withdrawing the throwout
bearing. (took a bit of muscle to move the lever) WHen I let go the lever
slowly pushed the throwout bearing back to the depressed position. Is this
normal?

I had replaced the slave cylinder while I had the engine out and blead the
system with a vacuum pump.
Any clues? Please help, It's never taken me this long to get an engine back in
before but I've not done it on this year bus before.

Also does the spring that holds the throwout bearing to the lever in the bell
housing supposed to hang down below the lever then go back up to latch on to
the lever? Been too long since I removed it! Cant find pictures in Bentley to
help.
