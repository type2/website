Hello all,

I'm preparing to troubleshoot my FI system using the excellent resource from
the Type 2 web page library.  I have no experience with this and don't know
what &quot;ring main&quot; is in reference to the FI system.  It says to check the
pressure here after pulling the hose off the air intake distributor.  I
think I know which hose to pull off?? but don't know where to connect my
pressure gauge.  Can anyone help a newbie with his journey into the world of
FI diagnosis??  Thanks in advance for any advice you can provide.

Jason
