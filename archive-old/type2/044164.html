Subject: [T2] Possible dead spark plug?

  When I start my 74 Bus, it idles at about 600-700, it used to idle 
properly at aroun 1000.  I've checked the throttle cable, and when I 
do push the pedal down, it seems like I have a lot less power.  Is it 
possible one of my spark plugs is dead, so I'm running on less 
cylinders now?  

How do I test a spark plug to see if it's good?

Thanks,
skinny
