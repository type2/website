You didn't mention if you were the one that drove the original engine 145K,
or was those were the miles when you started driving this bus.

What I have seen from many years of working on these busses is the driving
habits of people will also play a large roll in how long the engines will
last.  The most important gauge a person can have in their air cooled
vehicle is a tach.  You should limit as much as possible not driving your
vehicle below 2,800 RPM or above 3,800 RPM.  Do not &quot;lug&quot; the vehicle around
town or on hills, shift down.

In this day and age where VW's are unique, most people were just not taught
how to drive them.  I'm not saying this is your problem, but I have seen
this many times.
