Subject: [T2] My opinion on my posts re archive

hello all,

I agree that having the archives on line are a great resource. And since
internet access is almost ubiquitous, i cant really see the need to have
acess on CDROM...

I have no problem with someone selling CD's of the archives provided that
they also make the same information freely available elsewhere, and your
rights to copy that CD and give copies to all your friends etc. is
guranteed. If a CD is published and that same information is not made
available by anonymous FTP i will ask that my information be
removed... Preferably the FTP archive would include .iso images so i
can download and make my own exact copy of the CD's being distributed.

If the database is in a proprietary format that can only be read with
purchaseable database software, i would object.

If anyone wants to be the only source for a hard media copy, denying free
distribution &amp;/or copyying of that material on hard media, i will fight
it. If anyone claims a copyright over and above mine that says my material
should be free (as in speech and beer) i will fight it. and of course, i
reserve the right to change my mind and tell you you cant have it anymore
;)

For an idea of what the copyright of truly free documentation looks like
see:

Basically I contributed my posts to help others with problems with their
busses, the more people that can be helped the better... But i didnt
contribute my material to be the basis of someones new business
model... especially if that business model would attempt to force me into
paying someone else a profit to get my own material back.. (not that i
ever have anything really useful or helpful to say..)

for an interesting discussion on this topic see this link:
http://slashdot_dot_org/articles/01/02/12/1641240.shtml 
a discussion of Deja selling their usenet archives to Google. pretty
similar situation... (who owns the posts? who owns the archive? etc.)

Bus content... I just got a nice set of weber ICT's, and i plan on
building a 1641 or 1776 (balanced) to power one of my t2's

As always, when it comes down to the final mile, i defer to the
admins.... Whatever they think is best is okay by me.
