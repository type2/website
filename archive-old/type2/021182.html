Interesting, I just learned something.
Looking up your part number I noticed that the nut size changed during late
modelyear 73.
As we all know the steering box changed beginning modelyear 73, but with VIN
xxx x195236 the nut size was increased (from M20x1.5 to M24x1.5).
The VIN looks like the year end number, but its not indicated as such. With
the nut the shaft changed too.
The new part number is N 011 170 1.
I bet the rebuilders don't indicate this in their lists.

&gt;  ..... problem with a steering box i have just =
&gt; purchased for my '73 the box seemed identical and it went in fine, the =
&gt; pitman arm fitted then when i tried to replace the locking nut it seemed =
&gt; too small. All the local dealers will only help if i had a part number =
&gt; for the larger nut. Does anyone know the number or size as desperation =
&gt; is setting in and the welder may well be coming out!!      thanks in =
&gt; advance phil
