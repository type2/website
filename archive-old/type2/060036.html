Well this weeks question is as follows - I have all of my original
interior panels for my bus - i have been considering replacing them
becuase they are very old are very, very dirty - is it possible to
recondition them - ive read the recent post about rubber and im
wondering if there is a similar product for interior vinyl - my interior
panels are also warped etc.. but they dont have any serious holes in the
vinyl - ive tried one automotive cleaner - not armourall - and it didnt
seem to work out that great - but is there something better?????

I have used Simple Green, a bucket of water, a big sponge and a scrub brush-
with good results on dirt/scum.  Warped panels can be removed, soaked with a
hose, carefully take off the chromed trim, and laid on a flat concrete surface
with a board on top and weighted down (old batteries, tool boxes etc are good
for this) till they dry- hey presto- flat panels.  (be careful around the
front door pockets)   If you don't want the old ones, please don't throw them
away.  before putting the front doors on, put a piece of plastic sheeting in
there- I attach it with narrow strips of duct tape carefully so the tape
doesn't show after the panel is in , and tuck the bottom into the doors, so
the water that drips through the door won't hit the panel and warp it.

Duct tape will Save Us!!!!
