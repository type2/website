I recently replaced all the vent tube connectors on my 76 Westy and there
were several.  The one that produced the leak was behind the spare tire
well, but the ones behind the firewall on top of the tank were also leaking.
If I remember right their were at least 3 or 4 in there, one behind the
spare tire well, one near the fuel filler neck, and one directly above the
engine.  It is well worth your trouble to change all of these with a good
quality fuel hose.  Don't use vacuum hose because it isn't designed to be
exposed to fuel and it will harden and break.  Good luck.

Here's what the problem is...  Up against the 'roof' of the engine
compartment, between the outside sheetmetal and the spare tyre well
there's a couple of vent tubes that are joined together with a 2&quot; long
piece of rubber hose.  That piece of hose has aged to the point where
it's no longer fuel tight.  Reach up there and pluck it out.  Slide
another piece in there.  That'll fix the fuel leak. (And also the fuel
odor when you fill up!) BTDT. In the rain.  With fuel pouring all over
everything. Three hundred miles from home...

&gt; Last night I had an experience with it which I thought interesting. For
the
&gt; first time, I &quot;topped off&quot; the gas tank. After a right turn I noticed the
&gt; strong smell of gasoline. I pulled over, ran around to the back and
noticed
&gt; that gas was pouring down from behind the rear driver's side tire. I
watched
&gt; nervously as the gasoline pour slowed to a drip, then &quot;Pow!...Pow!&quot;, about
&gt; the sound of two loud backfires, several seconds apart. What amazed me was
&gt; that the sounds came from my BN4!  My uneducated guess is that gas fumes
&gt; accumulated under the intake pipe, were drawn into the hot combustion
&gt; chamber and exploded. I have yet to turn the heater back on.  I have,
&gt; however, become familiar with the workings of my fire extinguisher.
