Subject: Re: [T2] Safe, not Sound

Frank, The issue here is did you over heat the engine
and hurt it. The only way to check is to do a
compression test and see if you hurt the valves or
rings. Make sure to get the pully on straight with the
key lined up.  Work fast High Country is this
weekend.. Phil
