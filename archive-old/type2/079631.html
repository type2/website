I think that the overriders were an option that could be added to any
68-72 bumber.  I've added them to my 71.

&gt;Grant,
&gt;
&gt;As far as I know it is 68-72. Of course some had overriders and some 
&gt;did
&gt;not.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;What years are compatible with 72 rear bumpers (not counting the
&gt;&gt;differentces in brackets)?  Is it just 68-72 or can the early bus 
&gt;rear
&gt;&gt;bumpers be adapted too?
