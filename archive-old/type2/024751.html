Subject: vw's in tv commercials
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

hey all,
    This is my 1st day on the list. I think I'm already going to switch to 
digest mode due inbox overload. Anyway, I've been watching alot of tv today 
and was excited to see 2 tv ads w/ vw's in them. Both are pre-68 white over 
red transporters. The 1st is just in the background of a commercial 
advertising some company that allegedly invented the internet. In the 2nd 
commercial are good friend gets a lead role, he pulls up to a stop light sits 
there for a few seconds, the camera gets a shot of the stickers on the back, 
all i saw was &quot;save the earth&quot; and &quot;keep it green&quot;, but there were a bunch on 
there. and then the punchline of the commercial is something like&quot; instead of 
advertising to save the earth on your car why don't you save the earth by 
driving you car&quot; and this &quot;fuel-efficent&quot; sports car speeds past the vw. just 
thought i'd let you all know and introduce myself.

P.s.- other vw sightings have been on a &quot;spirit of the 60's&quot; cd compliation 
ad w/ a flower power bay window camper, back to the future where the enemies 
sport a transporter w/ sun roof used as a firing hole, and in some movie 
where a guy's personality tunrns into that of a dog, i cant remeber the 
title, but the people are the enemies again and drive a baja beige weekender.
