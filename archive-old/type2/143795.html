&gt; What exactly is failing when you have to perform a tune up again? I've

One thing that people forget when switching coils is that the coil and
condenser are a matched set.  The capacitance of the condenser offsets
the inductance of the coil and prevents arcing at the points.  If you
change the coil without putting in a matching condensor, the points will
suffer!
