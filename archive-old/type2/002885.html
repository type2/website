Thanks for all the good advice on the leaking Weber. Seems like most advice tends towards a problem with the valve seat/guide and/or gasket. 

A guy at my local flaps (Randy's (plug)) looked at the carb and thinks fuel is leaking out the bushings. I think he's right in which case I'll buy a new Solex. They're what, $130? I guess nobody around hear replaces bushing for less than that anyway.

Any thoughts?
