Marcus -

If you're near a mechanic or AAMCO who will do a free inspection, I'd
high-tail it there soon. Get a second opinion, if possible.

Armed with that info, you can make an informed decision  on how to proceed.

It sounds to me like the more you drive, the worse it'll get. The worse it
gets, the more $$$ to fix it.

Go. Now.

I don't know if the newer tranny will fit in your case (i fitted a '76 091
to my 1915 DP), but one thing to consider would be if the newer tranny has
taller ratios, would your bus handle it okay in your driving conditions.

Good luck -

Subject: no reverse in auto trans update


&gt;   I looked at the selector lever cable and made sure it was adjusted
properly
&gt; and no luck.  It is also shifting erratically while in D.  ATF level is OK
&gt; and doesn't smell burned.  I have a hunch that soon it's not going to move
in
&gt; D.  Has anyone switched from an early auto trans to a later auto trans?  I
&gt; called around today and it seems that I can get my hands on a 76-79 auto
&gt; trans without problem but no early ones.  It's a real PITA getting out of
&gt; parking lots without R, lots of strategic planning and an occasional push.
&gt; All suggestions appreciated.  Marcus
