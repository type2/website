Subject: Re: [T2] ADMIN: Mailing lists will be down this weekend

Hi Matt,

Is this a good time to break out the &quot;standby&quot; backup Yahoo group???

http://groups.yahoo_dot_com/group/type2-temp/

This would be helpful for those with a dire need for info or urgent  
need for Assistance.  I know I'll be traveling home from John Brown's  
Buses at that time and it would be useful to know that I could still  
find help if needed.

&gt; Listees,

&gt; On October 7th, the VintageBus and Type2 mailing lists, as well
&gt; as the type2_dot_com and vintagebus_dot_com web sites, will be down for
&gt; 2 to 3 days while the computer that hosts them is moved to a new
&gt; location.


Happy Trails,
