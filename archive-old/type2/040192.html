Subject: 1977 Parts Bus

I just picked up a junker bus. Serious right front damage. Body folded in 
along wheel well and front window broken. Also right front door folded. No 
engine. I am going to be taking some parts off it to use on my '70. I was 
wondering if anyone would be interested in some of the other parts from it. 
PLEASE REPLY PRIVATE EMAIL NOT ON LIST. I don't have a list of parts or have 
any idea what people may want or not but would like to recoup some of my 
money buying it. If you are in Southern California and might get near the 
Ridgecrest area, email about a week ahead of time as my schedule is chaotic 
at best. Also middle seat gone. This was a full bulkhead 1/3, 2/3 front seat 
model. 
Please drive safe,
Dana
