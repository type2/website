Subject: Re: [T2] Dead on the Water, Camping AC set up.


&gt;
&gt;5000 BTU unit on the luggage rack, with a piece of 3&quot; foam under it to
&gt;eliminate the harmonic vibration of the unit----
&gt;Now I take a 8&quot; flexible duct ( much like dryer duct only bigger) and
&gt;attach it to a piece of masonite, or 1/16th plywood and attach it to the
&gt;output side other AC unit-----

Buy one of those standup a/c systems that simply have an exhaust hose. Put 
the exhaust through a dryer vent through a window. The a/c unit would fit 
in the bus with you between the front seats.

I suspect you could find one that would fit in the upright spare tire 
cabinet behind the driver's seat in that late Westies.

These type of a/c units were popular in Italy when I lived there but I have 
seen them here in the USA too.
