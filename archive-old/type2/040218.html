Hello All,

Once again, I appeal to the experienced and knowledgable group for helpfull
advice.

As I'm driving the '74 VW Westy at highway speed there is a low, but odd
groan coming from below (it sounds like it is coming from the back of the
bus).  Then, as I slow down, it gets even louder.  It is definitely related
to how fast I'm going and seems to get louder the slower I go.  Slowing down
for a red light it sounds like something metal scraping everytime the wheel
goes around (very loud).  However, when I pull away from the traffic light,
it doesn't make a sound.  I've also tried driving slowly without having my
brakes on and it still makes this awfull noise.  Then, I jacked up the back
of the Bus (another question here) and spun the tire.   Not a sound.  When I
jacked up both sides of the back of the Bus and spun the tire, it made a
slight noise, but not much at all.  What could be making this noise?  How
can I continue to troubleshoot the problem?

I thought it may have been CV joints, since the CV Boots are toast.   Tried
to move them forward and back, but not much movement in there at all.  I
could grab the swing axle and turn the tire with hand strength.  Is there
much of a difference between VW made CV joints (have to order) and the ones
you can pick up at your friendly neighborhood parts store (in stock).  Also,
when you get new CV joints, what all is included?  Does it usually include
the thing you bolt on to the transaxle and the one you bolt on to the wheel?

I have a hydraulic floor jack and jack stands.  What do you usually use for
a lift point, and where do you normally put the jack stands.  Muir book
talked about jacks stands and lifting screwing up the usual VW Jack Lift
Points.

Sorry about the wordy description and all the questions, but just trying to
learn and become one with my Bus without my wife killing me for having it
out of commission too long (Exhaust stud breakage put it out for two days).

Thanks a lot,
