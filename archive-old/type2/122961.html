Subject: KYB Gas-a-Just rear shock too short?

I just recently installed KYB gas-a-just shocks on the rear of my 79 Westy.  
After installing the shocks, I noticed that at max shock extension, the 
shocks were not long enough to line up with the shock mounts.   I had to 
re-install the wheel and lower the back end to load up the suspension enough 
to line up the shock mount holes.  After this, the torsion spring arms are 
not contacting the lower stops by about 3/16 - 1/4 inch.  I've found a few 
old postings in the archive about this problem, but no follow-up. Has anyone 
experienced this or was I sent the wrong length shocks (i.e., too short)?  I 
ordered them from Cal Import Parts (CIP); I selected the ones identified for 
my year bus.

Thanks,

Bob
