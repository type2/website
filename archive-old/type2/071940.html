&gt;I pulled a brake servo out of a '78 bus in a junk yard and have a

&gt;in the front where the brake lever push rod attaches to the unit.  The
&gt;hose winds up and into the body and disappears into the door pillar.  I
&gt;have looked through my bentley and cannot find any reference to this
&gt;tube other than showing it.
&gt;
&gt;What is it for?
&gt;Where does it go?

It's an air intake hose, and it doesn't really &quot;go&quot; anywhere.  It just lets
filtered air into the booster.
