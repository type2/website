&gt; Hello all,
&gt;
&gt; My 71 Westy's ignition lock sometimes depresses about 1/4&quot; into the column.
&gt; In order for me to turn the engine, I have to stick my key in and wiggle out
&gt; the lock. What is going on with this? What do I need to do fix it?

That's how it should work.  Squirt some graphite lube into the cylinder to
make it work easier.

&gt; Also, the passenger side door lock is broken off, and the lock came out of
&gt; the handle...Can locksmith put a new lock in, or should I just buy a handle
&gt; with the lock and have it rekeyed?

If you can get hold of a cylinder, it is easy to rekey, particularly if
you have the broken lock cylinder.  Just swap the wafers and you're done!
