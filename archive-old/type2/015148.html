Subject: Hazard lights
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hey Volks,
Bear the new guy here again. I was double parked at a bank last night and
noticed that my hazards would stop working after about 5 minutes. They
would not go out, but just stop blinking. If I pushed in then pulled out
the knob they would start again...Anybody?
