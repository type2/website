Subject: wheel bearing identity
Message-Id: &lt;v01510100b3772a22f633_at_[207.172.60.13]&gt;

A neighbor was nice enough to bring me the remnants of his stash of ac
parts.  Among these was a wheel bearing with 311-405-625E written on the
package. I've looked through RMMW catalog but could not find an E bearing.

How does one go about reverse identifying such a part?

Thanks, Jack
