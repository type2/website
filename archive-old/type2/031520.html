&gt; &gt; also look at the top of the push rod, a hyd push rod is solid, a solid
&gt; &gt; pushrod is &quot;usually&quot; two piece, but this is a less reliable method.

&gt; No, a solid pushrod is hollow aluminum about 1/2'' in diameter.
&gt; A hydraulic pushrod is hollow steel about 1/4'' in diameter.
&gt; Both are hollow to lube the rocker arms.

sorry for misinformation, both are hollow but hyd is one piece, solid has
end caps, or looks like end caps.  magnet also works but I have seen em
swapped
