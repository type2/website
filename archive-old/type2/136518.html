Subject: Re: [T2] Aftermarket A/C for Type 2 Camper

I have the same issue living down here in Miami, come
April its brutal to drive the bus out. 

I know u can use aftermarket A/C units I  have looked
into using 12 VDC air conditioning units which do not
draw horsepower since the compresssor and all are
built in to it.

The only problem is that most of these units mount on
the roof, it will make the bus look horrible. There
are other 12 volt units that sit in the front between
the driver and passenger seats. I haven't bought one
since I don't know how good they work. here are some
links:

air units using ice:

&gt; However, come April, A/C will be a must-have item,
&gt; even for short 
&gt; trips. I detest the hot summers down here (I'm more
&gt; of a West Coast 
&gt; guy), and A/C is something we're very serious about
&gt; acquiring.
