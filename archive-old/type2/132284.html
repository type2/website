Subject: Re: [T2] Gaskets for air distribution box?

I'm going by my familiarity with 68-79 parts so correct where necessary...

&gt; Can I make the gaskets for the EGR valve and cold start inj. from bulk gasket

Yes. Here are some part numbers if you want to search (maybe different for
Vanagon):

&gt; Is the gasket that is between the throttle and air dist. box still available
&gt; anywhere?

Porsche dealer 022 133 073A.
 
&gt; How do you disconnect the linkage between the throttle and EGR valve? It looks
&gt; like both ends are held on with a circular keeper that was pressed on and will
&gt; probly be dammaged when I try to remove it.

Undo the linkage by rotating the hexbar in the middle.
 
&gt; I am also thinking about taking the EGR valve apart for cleaning. Do I just
&gt; take it apart and soak in carb cleaner or are there any tricks I should know
&gt; before I do it.

Here's an exploded view:

Just be careful with the rubber valves inside.

&gt; I am planning to cap off the EGR for now because of missing
&gt; filter and the pipe that should be coming out of the exhaust has been cut off
&gt; and welded shut,

Good idea.
