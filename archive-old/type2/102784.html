Subject: Re: Nicknames

All vehicles have a distinct personality, and the name just happens.  My 
favorite name story is the guy that has Possum :)  Phigment was named so 
because I talked about the bus for a couple of years but no one ever saw it, 
and when a friend from work stopped by one day I took her out to show her and 
she said she had thought it was a figment of my imagination...
