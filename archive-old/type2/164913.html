Subject: Re: [T2] Transition from Gas to Diesel

Hi Skyboy,

David Scharze is converting a bus to turbo diesel.  There is a lot of  
fabrication required, including motor mounts, transmission adapter,  
cooling system, and exhaust system. It is not a job for the  
squeamish, or for those on a tight budget.

It's certainly a worthy idea to entertain, but getting there requires  
substantial effort and resources.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; I will be the first to admit that I have very little knowledge of  
&gt; the difference between a gas engine and a diesel. With that, can a  
&gt; standard FI bus engine be converted to diesel?
&gt;
&gt; Also, is there a diesel engine that will fit in place of the bus  
&gt; engine and actually make the car go?
&gt;
&gt; With gas prices going up, and the techno advances in biodiesel and  
&gt; such, I just thought it would be a worthwhile idea to entertain.
&gt;
&gt; Too bad the only SUV I have found that runs diesel is the  
&gt; Volkswagen Touareg. It's a nice vehicle, but Consumer Reports  
&gt; slammed it on safety and reliability.
