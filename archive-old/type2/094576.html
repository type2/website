TODAY'S SIGN THE WORLD IS ENDING =20
    Despite gasoline prices spiraling upward, automakers continue to prod=
uce bigger and bigger truck-based sport utility vehicles. In what could b=
e called the Ultimate SUV, GM is releasing the 21 passenger Grand Canyon,=
 which weighs in at over 12,000 pounds, is 22 feet long, and is over 8 fe=
et tall, and eight feet wide. It comes equipped with a entertainment cent=
er with a 36 inch flat screen TV,  DVD 5.1 Surround system (sub woofer as=
 well), and can carry up to 9,000 pounds...(which means you could tow beh=
ind you a small car to get you to the gas station when the SUV runs out o=
f gas...) It has a 80 gallon tank and is expected to get 8 MPG on the hig=
hway. It has auto tinting windows, and power doors with GPS and side airb=
ags. It's engine is a V-14 with 0-60 in 15 seconds. It has A/C controls i=
n the front, back, and further back. The price for this will be around $1=
20,000 and there is already a list to get on to buy this. =20
