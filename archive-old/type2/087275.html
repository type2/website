Subject: I wanna...

Hey All,
I am looking for a 6 volt Southwind\Stewart warner gas heater (12 volt could also work).  Can be from a bug or bus, doesn't matter, but preferably it would be complete &amp; working.  I have a TON of stuff to trade including an Eberspacher early BN4 (although it has a dead coil, it still has all other parts including glow\spark plugs and fuel pump), as well as ANYTHING you would need (except seats and interior panels) from a '66 kombi, including an entire 1500 engine. Or I can buy outright for cash, but I prefer to trade. Anyone wanna do some bartering?



Peace, John Baker
