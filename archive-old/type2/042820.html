Subject: Complete Restoration Shop

I am posting this to both, the bus and notch reflector, since the 
answer can be generated from either source, given the depth of VW 
knowledge in both groups.

I have a 1964 Notchback &quot;Otto&quot; w/ 18,000 original miles.
2,000 miles put on the car in just the past few months.
The car is &quot;rust free&quot; and &quot;OEM complete&quot;.

My desire is to keep it that way, and drive it as a &quot;nice day&quot; driver.
But, as a function of time, unless properly arrested, the few minute 
areas of &quot;time erosion&quot; that any 37 year old car acquires while garage 
stored will destroy this car that deserves to be saved and cherished.

Question...............
I would like to send the car to a &quot;complete&quot; tear down and build back 
up shop.
The car needs to be disassembled and thoroughly cleaned, all metal 
chemically treated, rust inhibitor painted, detailed, and re-assembled 
so that I can expect 20 good years from it without fearing that 
undetected problem cancers might be eating away at my baby while I sleep.

Please forward this request on, or reply with suggestions, but I would 
like to confine my considerations to only very reputable shops that do 
scheduled work in a timely fashion, and give excellent results for the 
substantial money that I am prepared to spend.

The scope of what I want done is just beyond my available time and 
current ambition.
I want the Notch to receive the best work I can find from the best shop 
I can find.
