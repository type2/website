Subject: Re: FREE splitty Sundial camper interior

&gt;Well folks, I just picked up a '67 Sundial camper for parts. Runs &amp; drives for
&gt;150 bucks. The interior isn't in the greatest shape, then again it's a Sundial
&gt;conversion, so it looked rather cheezy from the get go. I was wondering if
&gt;there
&gt;was anyone out there that has a Sundial that could use some interior parts. So
&gt;the interior is free to the first person who picks it up. Otherwise it gets
&gt;crushed with the rest of the bus.
&gt;
&gt;I'm in Allentown Pa.
