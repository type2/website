Subject: Re: [T2] Water!

Gary,

I can't speak specifically to a '77 but I'm assuming it is similar to my
'70. If so you should find a hose running from the air intake area to a
drain toward the left. This hose is flimsy and can crack over time allowing
water into the trough area. This may be the source of your problem.
I replaced mine with a radiator hose from a local FLAPS.

Cheers,

John Rogers

&gt; I put some of that NASA silver &quot;bubble wrap&quot; insulation you can get at
Home
&gt; Depot underneath the front rubber mat in my 77 Riveria today.  When I
pulled
&gt; off the fiberboard panels to tuck it under I found water in a trough that
&gt; runs across the front, behind that panels.  Shouldn't there be some drain
&gt; holes there to allow any water to drain, or do I have a more serious
problem
&gt; and need to find where the water is getting in? I'm guessing that it's
&gt; coming in somewhere by the headlights.  It seems that the water gets in
&gt; after every hard rain, even if the van is just parked overnight.
