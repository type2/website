Subject: Re: [T2] Sacrilidge, Subaru Ea-81 into 78 VW Bus

David,

It wasn't a bash at all.

Just my observations, they can be taken as they are,
my opinion, nothing more.  About the experimental
aircraft having the type 4, I will tell you, I am
scared to drive one down the road because of it
spontaneously disintegrating, I wouldn't want to trust
it several hunderd feet in the air.  Neat to hear that
some trust it enough.  I agree, type 1's are more
bulletproof than type 4's, more so than the ea-81, but
then there is the power issue.

Kindest Regards,

Mark

&gt; &gt;Oh Yeah, they also use ea-81's in experimental
&gt; &gt;aircraft, you won't see our beloved type 4 in
&gt; those.
&gt; 
&gt; Uh, not to start a war or anything, but... &quot;yes you
&gt; will&quot;.  I was having a 
&gt; conversation offline with a listmember a couple of
&gt; days ago who is putting 
&gt; a type4 in his home-built aircraft.  He provided me
&gt; with references to 
&gt; others who have done the same.  And of course the
&gt; type 1 engine is in many 
&gt; more.  If you want to bash the type 4, kindly do it
&gt; on another list.
