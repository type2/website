Subject: Re: [T2] EMISSION REPAIRS?

Hi Darren,

I'm surprised they make you get a 72 emissions tested. Here in Ontario 
an 82 model wouldn't be tested in our &quot;Drive Clean&quot; program.

Is it possible to post your scores? Exactly how far off were you? Did 
you pass their visual inspection?

The results of CO, NO2 and HC concentrations would go a long way to 
helping us make useful suggestions.

And in the meanwhile...

1. Look for vacuum leaks. They have a huge impact on performance and 
emissions. My trailer was sporting a huge black smear from the exhaust 
after a long highway run to John Brown's Buses in West Virginia, but I 
found a vacuum leak while I was there and on the return trip there was 
no problem.

2. Get fresh points,condenser, plugs &amp; wires.

3. There is no #3. (Sorry, just had to throw in a minor Monty Python 
moment there).

4. Don't worry  about the oil &amp; filter, as these won't affect emissions 
unless your rings are really bad. Are you puffing blue smoke? Straight 
50 weight might help, it would certainly be better than 10W30. If it 
smokes blue at idle you are probably looking at an engine rebuild.

4. BE CAREFUL WITH THE TIMING. Set the dwell at 48-52 degrees and then 
set the timing as per the bentley manual. Don't be tempted to time it 
by ear, as this can cause the engine to run hotter than intended.

Happy trails,

&gt; Hey peoples,
&gt;
&gt; I have a 72 van and I just had it tested at the emissions place.
&gt; I have failed the test and have 3 months to fix it up.
&gt; Any pointers to fix her up so she can pass?
&gt; I know that I need to adjust the timing , change the oil and filter,
&gt; put new spark plugs in . i have the dual carbs so i'm thinking that 
&gt; they may
&gt; need to be
&gt; rebuilt.is there anything else that i may be forgetting?
&gt; Thanks
&gt; your help is much appreciated.
