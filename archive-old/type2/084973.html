Subject: Re: [T2] T1 or T4 Engine Stand??

That would work - be sure not to make it too short.

I hate to bend over while I work away the hours.

I built my own stand from scratch.

&gt;ok, let's see if i can explain this? i bought a 1000lb capacity engine 
&gt;stand, meant for v8's, and a vw bench mount engine stand. how are folks 
&gt;cutting these to make a vw stand? i thought i could cut the 3/4 of the 
&gt;tube off of the v8 stand, leaving a the bottom of the tube in place. the 
&gt;cut the flat plate from the vw stand and lay the tube in the cup, sort of, 
&gt;left on the v8 stand and mig away. sound about right?
