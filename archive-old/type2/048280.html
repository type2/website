&gt; 
&gt; I apologize in advance for the sketchy details...
&gt; My cousin blew the engine on her '78 Westy and bought a factory rebuilt
&gt; engine to replace it.  The shop installing it said it was a different type
&gt; of engine-though manufactured a few months apart-and had to modify it a bit
&gt; to get it to fit.  After much frustration they now cannot get it to
&gt; run-something about the ground or the computer reading &quot;shut down fuel&quot;.  If
&gt; he puts fuel in it himself it will run.  That's about all I know.  Can
&gt; anyone offer advice-the poor kid's spent all her $ on this bus and might
&gt; just throw in the towel.  Thanks much.

this is painful to read about.  I'm going to assume it's the 2L US
engine, right?

I've never seen anything vastly different in them. My 77 engine looked
exactly
like my 81 vanagon engine. The fuel injection parts swapped without any
problems
between the years. The engine cases are mostly identical.
 
I'm not sure what they would be modifying, maybe some tin, but certainly
nothing
on the engine?
 
The fuel injection isn't all too difficult to troubleshoot, assuming
everything else
with the engine is correct.  I'm not sure I'd make that leap here,
though :(

see if you can get more details from the shop or her (obviously) And
work through
the Fuel Injection troubleshooting guide.
 
good luck

matt
