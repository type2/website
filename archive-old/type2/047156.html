More on Colorado Springs trip:

We left on Friday night very late headed to Colorado Springs to take our grandson back home.  We had him here for a month.  The 78 Westy had never been on a long trip (2000 miles round trip).  We have just had her for about 6 weeks and had only put about 1200 miles on driving mainly close to home.  the VW did really well all the way out, except for nearly freezing,  there is no seal on the pop-top, but there will be soon.  We now have the heater working to some degree and it is warmer.  On our way back, about 3 hours out of Dodge City, the engine started missing........ not much........ at first.... but got bad pretty quickly.  It died on the exit ramp into Garden City, Kansas.  Got is restarted and pulled off the road and my husband started to trace down what was wrong.  We thought for a little while that we were going to have to call a list member from Dodge City, (I printed the list and took it along), but found out it was the points, so they were filed down and put back in and we were once again on our way.  this seems to have fixed the problem and have had nothing happen since.
sorry about being so long winded........
