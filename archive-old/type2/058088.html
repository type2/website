Subject: RE: clutch noise, rear brakes, tires

&gt; From: David Preston &lt;prest010_at_gold.tc.umn_dot_edu&gt;
&gt; Subject: Clutch still rumbles
&gt; As I reported earlier when I push the
&gt; clutch in I hear a deep rumble.  Suspected the throw out. -- Replaced it
&gt; -- still rumbles. 
	[]  
	Volks: I am resending this as I didn't see this during the list
brownout. Two problems I'd like comments, info on:

	Unlike Dave, I have the opposite problem. When sitting still in
nuetral with the clutch out, 
	I hear a pum....pum....pum noise that I thought was the beginning of
an exhaust leak. 
	The repetition rate matches engine speed.
	Then I notice when I put in the clutch the noise goes away????? Any
idea what this could be?

	Second, my right back brake was grabby. When I took it apart, the
wheel cylinder was leaking, and the shoes
	had black gick on them which I assume is brake fluid and dirt. I
scraped them clean, sanded them a bit, and then washed
	them with alcohol. My question is when I replace the wheel cylinder,
do I need new shoes because they
	got brake fluid on them? I hate to throw them out as they are the
original shoes, and are only about 1/4 worn? 

	Third: I just boought Michelin MX reinforced 185SR14 tires. They
seem a bit wobbly, but this may be 
	because the 22yr old Michelin 185SR14XZ's that were on it had turned
to stone. While talking to 
	Continental, the fellow told me their CR21 tire was specifically
made for VW buses,and Westies?


	Thanks for any help. BIll Crick
