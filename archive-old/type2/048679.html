&gt; I can't recall the name of the outfit [based in Arizona, I think] that makes
&gt; the full air recirculation kits for buses and bugs advertised in the VW
&gt; magazines.
&gt; 
&gt; The diagrams in their ads show the &quot;intake&quot; hoses from the vehicle interior
&gt; to the heat exchangers as completely bypassing the fan shroud on upright

&gt; ...fan(s) could be wired to run all the time, with heat output to the
bus
&gt; interior controlled solely by the dash levers and HE output air valves, but
&gt; that would prematurely wear the blower motors and draw a lot of precious
&gt; juice.

Many modern cars run their blower motors on &quot;low&quot; all the time.  Doesn't
seem to be a big problem.
