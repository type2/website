Subject: Bus Illustration online

Hi Volks,

I took a digital photo of Denmeister's  bus last year, and in a slow moment
this week I traced it in an illustration program. It actually turned out
pretty well, so I thought I'd post a copy on my web-page and let you'all
know where to find it. In the original Adobe Illustrator file I have it
layered to remove the pop-top and to preview multi-coloured paint schemes.
If you have Acrobat Reader, you should be able to open the web-based PDF
file. If you don't have the reader, it's easy to get from www.adobe_dot_com.
Anyone who wants the EPS version can pmail me and I'll send it along.

Check out www.geocities_dot_com/vw_type2 the link to the pdf file is in the
final paragraph.

If you do have Illustration 'ware that can read EPS or PDF files, this file
is constructed perfectly for previewing that radical paint-job you've been
contemplating.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
