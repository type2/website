Thanks to all who responded to my request for info on these models.  I
reached an agreement with the seller and will be picking them up this
Saturday.  I'm stoked!  I've got about thirty days before I'll need to rely
on the resulting loaf, so I'm going to take some time and maximize the
heating system, and replace all the fuel system rubber with some kinda
carbon fiber, high pressure, halon impregnated fuel line.  Or something
like that.
Further pleas for help to follow....
Russell
