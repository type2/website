Subject: Re: [T2] Re: New Pistons ?

all I can say right now is we run a very tight deck, about .030&quot;. The piston
shape is designed to create a very nice (detonation proof) chamber, with
lots of swirl. I'll also add two things.

1) the mixture is confined to a very small space, which reduces the amount
of heat transfer from the head to the A/F mixture (less surface area).

2) The instantaeous load on the engine (cylinder pressure) is LOWER than
with a conventional engine, just extended thru a much longer period of time,
for more push on the crank and at better crank/rod angles. More power on
less air/fuel. since more work is done, there is less leftover heat to deal
with, and the engine runs cooler.

Snake oil? Even after it's proven some old timers will dispute the results.
Even if I let them DRIVE a car equipped with it, they'd likely claim some
secret fuel tank or cooling system, since it's contrary to most conventional
VW &quot;knowledge&quot;.
