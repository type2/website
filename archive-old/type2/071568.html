I have a 70 bus. Let me first say that this is the only v w  of any kind i 
have
ever driven or ever rode in for that matter. When i bought this bus 3 yrs. ago
i had to put in a new motor. I wanted everything new on the motor. The man
at the supply house where i bought the motor and everything else told me
that the 009 dist. was the best way to go. I assumed that was right, what
do i know. I have been very satisfied with the dist. but remember I have never
drove another v w so i can't compare. I decided to get out the vacum advance
and put new points, cond., rotor and cap.&quot; it don't work.&quot;Put back the 009,
started the engine and connected the hose of the vac. adv. dist. to vac at the
carb. It advances wide open at idle. what's wrong?
