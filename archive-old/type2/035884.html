Subject: warm all over

Such an uninhibited display of warmth and welcome! Thanks List...
	I previously posted a (stupid?) question about my recent rebuild of my BN4 
with no response - me sad - is this because I have the last working BN4 
available to buskind? Are they rare or just uninteresting?
	My problem is that I turn it on and get all systems go but fuel pump, which 
I can jump with a wire from the switch wire to the relay - very dangerous, 
but effective. Any similar experiences?

New to bus world
