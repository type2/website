Subject: anyone have underdash parcel tray?

Folks,

http://www.busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=78990

Noticed these on the BD site again and am wondering if anyone has tried 
one on their bus.

Yes, I looked at the pic, but it isn't like any bus I have!  And I can't 
see where the drink holders are.... 

The steering wheel is in a weird position too...I guess it looks like it 
was a picture of a &quot;rolled&quot; picture.

Do they work well?

Cheers, dave
