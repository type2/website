Subject: Re: Do two thin wires = 1 thick wire?

Volks, 

Indroductory remarks:

Wire gauges are nowhere near as standard as we think :-)  Americans use
American Wire Gauge (AWG), but there are also Standard Wire Gauge (SWG)
(used to be used in Britain, and I believe it still is (awaiting
correction if I am wrong :-)) and Metric wire sizing.  All the wires on
our buses were originally Metric, but these days... who knows?  Anyway,
The short answer to Hugh's question is that you need 4 lengths of 16 AWG
wire to replace 1 length of 12 AWG wire and 5 lengths of 16 AWG to replace
1 strand of 10 AWG, based on ohms/1000' resistance (which measures the
heat the wire is likely to generate). Below is the analysis:

&gt; Ok, I know this is a little on the cheap side, but that 10 or 12 guage wire

Yes it does.  the problem is, it probably does not improve them enough.
What you are dealing with here is (a) cross section area of the wires and
(b) heat rejection ability. Despite our pious wishes, copper wires have
only a &quot;good&quot; rating as far as transferring electrons.  Lots of them don't
make it from the alternator/generator to the battery, they get lost as
heat.  The more cross section you have in your wire(s), the less get lost,
but the more outside area you have on your wires, the more electrons (now
turned to heat) the wire can lose before it melts the insulation off
itself.  In addition the real standard is ohms/1000' which tells you
your losses. Below are calculations based on AWG (1):

16 gauge wire has a diameter of 0.051 sq. in.  Pi*(r)squared says the
cross section of that wire is .002043.  The ohms/1000' are 4.10.  Two
lengths means you have a combined cross section of .004086.  Three lengths
have a cross section of .006129, four is .008172. ohns/1000' for multiple
strands is the base/# of strands or 2 strands = 2.05, 3 = 1.37, 4 = 1.03 

12 gauge wire has a diameter of 0.081&quot;. The cross sectional area is
.005153 and the ohms/1000' is 1.62.

10 gauge wire has a diameter of 0.102. The cross sectional area is
.008172 and the ohms/1000' is 1.02.

SO.... to get the same current passing ability as a 12 gauge wire you need
*4* lengths of 16 gauge wire, to match 10 gauge, you need 5.

Now, countering this are two other arguements:  First, more runs gives you
more surface area to reject heat, and second there will be some effect
&gt;from impedence if they are run right next to each other, at the same time
there will be some increase in resistance, so I don'y they will matter
enough to offset the loss of cross section.

&gt; And has anyone had any luck using 16 guage wire to charge the second 
&gt; battery?

I have not, but if I were, I would spring for at least the 10 gauge wire,
if not 8 gauge. A run-down battery can draw all 65 amps that the
alternator produces and that much electricity will *heat* a wire!  There
is nothing like saving 5 bucks on wire and spending 100 on a new
alternator.

I would certainly apprecciate it if George or one of the electrical gurus
would check me on this.
