We are right there with you!  Karen and I live in Capital Hill in tiny, but
terrific, studios.  We have worked on both Russ and Rhoda in our 'driveway'
that's about as level as a Mexican highway.  I'm pretty new to serious
mechanics too, but have managed a few amazing feats of wrench artistica!
We've got some tools, some books and a willingness to help!

Let us know!

never there!  And where you are ain't no good unless you can get away from
it!&quot;

&gt; 
&gt; Greetings listees! I was wondering if there was anyone in the Greater Seattle
&gt; or Everett, Washington area that would be willing to a) mentor a VW newbie,
&gt; b) offer up any good mechanics in my area, c) offer a place where I may fix
&gt; my clutch (would probably take me several days, as I have not done it
&gt; before.) I am willing to do the work, just need a place to do it. I live in
&gt; an apartment complex where they don't allow that type of thing. Any help
&gt; would be appreciated. My e-mail address is santori1_at_cs_dot_com
&gt; Thank You.
