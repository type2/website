Subject: Pertronix Ignitor/VDO Tach

Hello all. I have a question regarding the compatibility of the Pertronix 
Ignitor and the VDO tach that Bus Depot sells. I just installed the Ignitor 
and VDO tach in my westy, and the tach will not work. All the connections are 
correct and clean, and the DIP switches are in their proper setting for four 
cyl. operation. When I found the tach to be inoperative, I removed it from 
the dash, and connected it directly at the engine using jumper leads. Still 
no go. I then Re-set the DIP switches to six cyl. mode and jumpered it to my 
wifes Subaru XT-6 ( very cool engine! flat 6, H20 cooled, all aluminum. Wish 
I could convince my better half to let me put it in the camper!) When I did 
this, it worked fine. Is there some sort of compatibility problem with the 
Pertronix unit and the VDO tach that I don't know about?
Thanks in advance, Robb &amp; Nikki
