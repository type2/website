Subject: I'm Back!  LOTS of news!

Well, Evon, Haley and I are back from Europe.  I have lots of stuff to tell
you all, both personal and Bus Depot related, so I'm going to break it into
a few separate posts by subject so you can delete if uninterested.

In a nutshell, the trip was great, and I can highly recommend the firm that
rented us the VW camper in Europe.  While there, I located a ton of original
German Bus and Vanagon parts, and bought nearly a container load worth,
which will be here in about a week. There are some incredible deals here.
I'll have a full list for you within a day or so. They will be offered to
list members first, then to the general public.  Please read my separate
posts regarding these parts, plus specific posts on heat exchangers,
bumpers, Just Kampers, etc. if you are interested.  I'm splitting them up
with their own subjects to facilitate your use of the &quot;delete&quot; key if so
desired.

We had a really incredible time, but at the same time I'm glad to be home!
