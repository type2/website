Jan -

Earlier today you wrote:
&gt;I have been in mail contact with Ken and Steve. Since they cannot
respond to
&gt;the list themselfes I took the liberty of sending this message to
explain
&gt;this to you. The result for all not directly affected by the problems is
an
&gt;unuseually low list volume.

Thanks (A LOT) for the update.  This is the first list message I've
received since Saturday PM!  Massive, sudden bus withdrawal is NOT a
pretty sight!  Staring vacantly at URL ERROR messages on the monitor;
'mewling and pawing piteously' at the keyboard.  8-O  Hopefully the
combined super-human efforts of Ken and Steve will start to have results
SOON (wimper)...
