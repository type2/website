Brian,

Was it a German  *Meistersatz- came in a blue and yellow box #251-598-201*
boot kit,  or could it have been Brazilian?  Either way,  I would check with
them about exchanging  it for a new * preferably German* one.  You know,
LIFETIME WARRANTY on every product they sell.

&gt; While I was dropping my engine today I noticed the CV boot I put on last
&gt; summer looks like its 30 years old!
&gt; Not just a little crack but huge dry rot cracks and large openings. I got
my
&gt; boot from RMMW last summer. Is this normal? It was only $16.00 - came with
&gt; grease and hardware- but my gosh! one year!
