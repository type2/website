Subject: Re: Coleman Plat Cat heater report--HEADACHE when used

I think this has just been going on the Vanagon list, but I'm going to copy 
the Type2 list as well. The subject is the Coleman Duracat heater which 
states it is safe for indoor use ( with proper venting) I just came in from 
my garage where I have one just out of the box up and running- the stench is 
horrible. I'd been coating a rusted area under the rocker I cut out with POR 
15, which also stinks like hell. I didn't really notice it until my wife came 
out to the garage and mentioned it, then left immediately. I hope this is 
some kind of coating burning off, otherwise this thing is going back to Home 
Depot. After a breath of fresh air, and going back into the garage, it was 
very noticeable.          Jeff S.
