Subject: Re: [T2] Hydraulic valves or solid? New question!!!

&gt; Now that everyone is wound up over the valves, now
&gt; comes a question. Why are there a camshaft for hyd

&gt; camshaft? why are the pushrods a different size? Last
&gt; can hyd lifters be put into a case without changing
&gt; anything? Seems what the list has said is that hyd
&gt; lifters can be put into a case without any problem, I
&gt; just took it for granted that something was different
&gt; on the engines because the camshafts were different,
&gt; let me know the truth...Phil 

the key seems to be reusing lifters, a hyd (and probably a solid) needs to
have lifters that have always or never run on that camshaft. anything else
is asking for trouble....a brand new lifter will shape itself to the cam
and be fine.  but a lifter from anouther engine can cause problems.

YMMV
