&gt; I just got a call from Rob Henley.

&gt; Long Version short:
&gt;
&gt; The three bolts from the flex plate to the torque converter have backed
&gt; themselves out or atleast two of them. He needs the sixe and type of the
&gt; bolts. I can get to them when I get home but can't from here. If anyone can
&gt; help with the specs on these bolts please email me or call my cell phone at
&gt; 704-400-3089. He is trying to find something to get him home.

not sure if you got a response on these yet, these bolts are unique in the
bus, very short with a large flange head.   they are 13mm bolts.  if he
drove with em loose damage is likely, (ask me how I know?)
