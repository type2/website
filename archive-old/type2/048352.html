Alright, I need to jump in here.  Every time my engine gets warmed up
(driving on the freeway for about 15 minutes), the oil press light will come
on at idle.  What the heck?  It seems to idle at about 4psi and I am using
40W.  My idle is adjust correct too.

Separate topic:

When I am driving my 71 cold and I push in the clutch to come to a stop, the
motor will die.  If I am coming to a stop and I push in the clutch and then
blip the gas, it will not die.  Is there something wrong with my idle
circuit or what?  I could not find any useful information in the archives.

I'll bet your hot idle oil pressure after a
&gt; half hour of 55 mph driving is not very high (5 to 10
&gt; psi).  &gt;

If it drops below about 7psi, you'll start to get the idiot light, right?

If i drop an new engine in properly and i start to get an oil light - at
anypoint during the warranty period -i'd be on the phone immediately.
