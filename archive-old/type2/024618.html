Subject: Front windshield rust blues
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

Can anyone here tell me how to prevent RUST from forming under a bay windo 
Bus' front windshield? Better yet, how do you keep water out from underneath 
it? I removed my old glass, cleaned, filled some tiny holes, rust proff 
primed, and painted the area then installed a new seal. It hasn't even rained 
here (just morning DEW) and now I see a rust trail starting under the 
window!!!  When I lifted up the rubber it was all wet underneath. What gives? 
 Besides the obvious clue to never getting it wet can anyone give me a better 
solution? Should I coat the entire surface in silicone? Any help would be 
appreciated.
