Subject: Water tanks
Date: Fri, 15 Sep 2000 18:32:24 +0100

I have been toying with the idea of fitting underfloor tanks for fresh and
waste water, to free up space inside the bus and save having to fetch and
empty constantly while camping where there are only basic (or no)
facilities (5 people can get through a lot of water).
I don't remember this being discussed on the list before, so I thought I
would ask your opinion on whether it was a good or bad idea.  Does anyone
have fixed tanks fitted to their bus?  What's the deal with filling them up
at campsites?  Do you just park near the tap and run a hose, and connect
another hose to empty?
