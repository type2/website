Subject: Nokian Tires

Thanks all for pointing me to the dealer directory!
What was wrong with my query is that when I went to
their website, I selected what I thought was the
appropriate fork in the road, &quot;SUV - Light Truck&quot; This
evening I selected &quot;Vans&quot; and there were the loadrange
C / 8 ply 14&quot; tires. Guess that was dumb on my part!

Now, would someone with experience on Nokians and
maybe Coopers and / or BF Goodrich / Costco Kirkland
Brand give me a comparison of sidewall flex, please.
Thanks.
