&gt;1) when i took engine out, there were two random wires connected to the #3
plug.
&gt;Upon reassembly, I promptly forgot what they were for and only now
realized that
&gt; they were for the cyl head temp gauge.  What gives...is there supposed to
be a sender or
&gt;what for this?  what is missing?

Sender, buy a new one from Bus Depot $16, and something to SERIOUSLY
consider on a new engine, it is worth popping for 4 new fuel injectors and for
having the mixture set and verified.  New injectors would be from Advanced
or AutoZone for $30 each, NOT from Bus Depot ($60?).  A tip on the head temp
sensor (it shouldn't run without it or not under power for long BTW) is
that if you
already got the intake runners on, it is a PITA to put the sender in if the
engine
is in the car, BUT if you wad up the wire into a 13mm deep socket and use that
to install it, it will be a breeze to put in.

&gt;2)  WTB a good gas tank...are there any options to replace the stock one
with?
&gt;Discovered that after test driving and running out of gas, that the bottom
of the
&gt;tank is crushed in an causes the sender to misread----also big enough to
displace a few

That would be Bus Depot $170 or good used about $50 most yards, but make
sure you look carefully at the top of the tank, they rust, particularly the
air
cooled where the big heater hose holds dirt against the top that gets damp.
Even rust in dry climates.  But if it isn't rusted, why F with it?  The gages
can be notoriously innaccurate even if the tank is perfect, figure out how far
the van goes on a tank and drive that far, you got a trip odo.  Oh BTW if you
didn't replace all the fuel lines, all the way from tank around the ring,
back to
the tank INCLUDING AND ESPECIALLY the ones on the injectors if you don't
replace the injectors.  FWIW I got a nice '87 tank in WV and I guess the late
filler to make it work if you are near and wanted it, but it isn't shippable.
