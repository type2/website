Subject: RE: Unleaded fuel

[...]

I am still a little confused about this...  It was my understanding that
the octane number reflects the rate of combustion and is directly
related to the timing.  How does the presence of lead affect the timing
between (say) 91 RON unleaded and 91 RON leaded?  If the octane is the
same, should this not mean the timing is the same?

&gt; CJ engine 2000cc, Twin Carb 91 RON LEADED, ignition 7.5 BTDC 70BHP_at_
&gt; 4200rpm.
&gt; OR
&gt; GD engine 2000cc, Fuel injection 91 RON UNLEADED, ignition 5 ATDC
&gt; 70BHP_at_4200rpm
&gt; 
&gt; These were esentialy the same engine but the use of leaded or unleaded
&gt; fuel is
&gt; built into the design of the fuel delivery system and the setting of
&gt; the
&gt; ignition timing..
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; But twin carbs with electronic ignition was used in European spec Vans
&gt; - these
&gt; could use leaded or unleaded BUT THE IGNITION WAS RETARDED 5 DEGREES
&gt; IF
&gt; UNLEADED FUEL WAS TO BE USED.
