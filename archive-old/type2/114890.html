Subject: Re: [T2] BA6 and stock heater

Hi Thor,

The BA-6 adds extra hot air to the output of the heater boxes. When 
it's not on the heater boxes work as usual.

There's a manual for the BA-6 online here:

Happy trails,

&gt; I have a 78 westy, I was wanting to get the stock heater working. Is 
&gt; the

&gt; Do I have to remove the BA6? I never have taken off the belly pan
&gt; before. The BA6 has never ran since I have owned it and the PO did not
&gt; know it existed on the ride. So  I can see on the drivers side some
&gt; wires that are wrapped in electical tape. So I do not know where to
&gt; start.
&gt;
&gt; Can the stock heater work with the BA6, or is it inline and blocking 
&gt; the
&gt; stock?
