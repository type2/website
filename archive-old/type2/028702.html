&gt;      I have a strange problem on my 82 westy.  The oil light 
&gt; functions just
&gt; the way it is supposed to except it is very dim.  It comes on with the
&gt; ignition key &amp; goes right out after I start but it is almost too 
&gt; dim to see
&gt; in the bright sunlight.

Maybe the PO replaced the bulb with the wrong type?  Just a thought.

Cheers,
