Subject: a few parts 

I have a few parts left after selling my 71. I'm in western NC for the larger parts, others can be shipped. Contact me off list at vwbaybus_at_yahoo_dot_com . Parts will be priced according to condition and knowing that times are hard. I also know from experience that most of us have sunk a fortune into their ride. I like to barter if you have something interesting you might want to trade. Parts available: rear bumper (warped, but better than nothing), sink/cooler, oil bath air filter, original cushions that level bed in camper, you know, that fit over engine, am/fm radio with VW faceplate, front air grill and screen that fits behind it, Bentley manual, rear hatch button release. I have lots of VW Trends and Hot VW's I would part with if you need a particular issue. I may have a few other pieces that I have forgotten. And I need some stock front seats for my 74 standard beetle if anyone know of some. Thanks. My best to all. Drive safe.   Clark
