This is a GREAT event! Them French Canadians sure know how to party. Some
brought instrument (independently), then started jammin' (Congo drums,
Didjeridoo, guitars, a violin, and a lot of voices!) all night long. A
blast!

They were about 60 busses last year and are expecting even more this year.

The location (Tadoussac) is also a particularly scenic one. My daughter and
I even spotted some Beluga whales where the Saguenay river meets the
St-Lawrence.

Highly recommended.
