Subject: Motor Size

Greetings,

What are your thoughts on a 2110cc motor for a 1971 Westy.  This would
be a 82mmx90.5mm type 1 motor.  Full flow oiling with 96 plate oil
cooler and 180deg thermostatic fan.  Dual 40-44 IDF Webers (or maybe 40
Kardons with electric choke), stock heater boxes, ceramic header with
single QP muffler.  009 dizzy and Pertronic pointless ignition.  I would
plan on mounting the oil cooler (leaving the stock dog house in place)
over the transmission.  Of coarse I would have an oil temp gauge and
keep a close eye on it.  Would this setup be cool running with good gas
mileage?  Would I get 50+ k out of it?  Have you tried it?

Thanks,

d
