nothing goes between the cooler and crankcase, except the oil cooler
seals..If you install the washers, you will have an oil geyser in the back
of your bus..

&gt; I'm sure the answer to this is in the archives, but I can't get a query to
&gt; complete right now - just hangs.
&gt;
&gt; So here goes ...
&gt;
&gt; When installing the oil cooler on a 2.0 liter engine, where do the
&gt; 'thickish' washers go? Under the nuts ... or between the cooler and the
&gt; crankcase?
&gt;
&gt; I could have sworn when I tore it down they were under the nuts - along
with
&gt; the thin spring washers. And yet Haynes says - 'don't forget the washers
&gt; between the cooler and case'. No mention of this in Bentley.
&gt;
&gt; Perhaps the P.O. put them in the wrong place?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance!
