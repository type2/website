Subject: RE: Carver (aka Propex) propane heaters

For converting some of the metric/British units to ours here are some 
numbers:

From:             To:              Do:
kW (kW/hr)        BTU (BTU/hr)     multiply by 3413
kcal (kcal/hr)    BTU (BTU/hr)     multiply by 0.397
Liters            Gallons          multiply by 0.264
km (km/hr)        Miles (Miles/hr) multiply by 0.62
Miles (Miles/hr)  km (km/hr)       multiply by 1.61
L/100km           Miles/Gal        divide 235 by L/100km
Miles/Gal         L/100km          divide 235 by Miles/Gal

&gt; &gt;Did anyone ever respond to Pat's question about BTU's on these heaters?
&gt; Yes.  This information is courtesy of Ron Van Ness:
&gt; 
&gt;      Early model 12v BN4 (71-earlier bus):
&gt; 
&gt;      Heat variable from 1080-4000 kcal/hour
&gt;      Fuel consumption  0.2-0.65 liters/hour
&gt;      Operating range  10-14V
&gt;      Nominal voltage  12V
&gt;      Current Draw  50 watts
&gt;      [didn't find mention of CFM]
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;      Late model 12v BN4 (72-74? bus):
&gt; 
&gt;      Heating capacity from 4,000-16,000 BTU
&gt;      Hours/Gallon of fuel: U.S. 6-16.5
&gt;                            IMP  7-18
&gt;      Power consumption  50 watts
&gt;      [again, didn't find CFM mentioned]
&gt; 
&gt; And the documentation from Carver states that their models 1600 and 2600
&gt; put out 1.6kW and 2.6kW respectively.  The problem comes with all these
&gt; units.  First of all, I can't find any mention that kilowatts is a term
&gt; related to BTUs.  The closest I could find (at
&gt; http://www.inotek_dot_com/conversions.html, a cool URL for this sort of thing)
&gt; was kilowatt-hrs.  To convert kilowatt-hrs to BTUs, you multiply by 3,413.
&gt; Therefore, the 1600 would put out 5460.8 BTUs (I know that's too many
&gt; significant digits), and the 2600 would put out 8873.8 BTUs.  Again,
&gt; that's assuming that when the Carver documentation says kW they really
&gt; mean kW-hrs.  To further complicate things, at one point the Carver doc.
&gt; calls this &quot;heat input&quot; and another place calls it &quot;heat output&quot;.  As for
&gt; the BN4's, I'm afraid I give up on kcals/hour and how that relates to
&gt; BTUs.  (Ha, assuming it isn't the same THING as BTUs!  I should have paid
&gt; more attention during Chemistry.)
