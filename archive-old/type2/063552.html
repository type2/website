&gt; heater tubes.  This solution is noisy and the tubes don't seal very well.  I
&gt; called BusBoys for the replacement plastic bellows-type connectors and Bill
&gt; said they don't have them.  He said that they are a couple inches longer
&gt; than the bug connectors and he doesn't know of anyone who has them.  RMMW

I use the tubes from later bugs, the one that goes under the seat, 
I believe it is...

I had to make an adapter for my bus, since the tube diameter was smaller.
I used a short piece of PVC pive, and a rubber pipe adapter.
