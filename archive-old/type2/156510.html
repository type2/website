Subject: Re: [T2] cargo door

Kevin,

&gt; Bad news, I crashed my cargo
&gt; door into a barrier today.

Mine was done in by a red light-running bunghole.

&gt; the  one off of my donor bus.  It's a '71 or '72.  Same door,
&gt; right??

The earlier handles rotate up instead of down, don't know the year change
though.

&gt; How hard are the windows to pop out?

Not bad, for side windows, push at a lower corner with steady, even pressure.
Having a friend outside to pull helps too.  Windshield is a higher degree of
difficulty.

&gt; is giving me a new
&gt; windshield he has in his garage.  So I'll pull the old one, fix
&gt; the rust, and pay $75 to have a windshield shop install it.

Hey! I need a free windshield too!  Is your old one broken?  I cracked mine.
For that matter, any Tennesseans with a spare to sell?

&gt; know I'd break it after reading the horror stories here.

Like mine?

(ps: Ate at City Cafe finally)

M'boro, TN
