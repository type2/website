Subject: Road trip-camping in Neustadt (Holstein)-Part 1-Long
Content-type: text/plain

Hi All,

Yes, it's been vacation time over here in Sweden and that means it's time for
for another European road trip story. This year the week long camping trip (and
the bus, of course)took us down to northern Germany on the &quot;Ostsee&quot; to a town
called Neustadt. Here's how it went...

Part 1- Preparation and the trip down...

As some of you may remember from previous posts, I was having significant brake
problems on my ´72 as well as keeping busy with an interior modification. My
brake problems were resolved with the help of my ´72 parts panel bus (R.I.P),
the local VW shop, and a medium size chunk of my accumualted savings. With my
bus now having super brakes, I was able to concentrate on the interior work.
The main idea here was to replace my existing 12VDC fridge with a larger
combi(220VAC/12VDC/propane) job. 

After removing the cabinetry and making the first cuts, I quickly realized my
&quot;little job&quot; was to become the nightmare fridge exchange from hell. I was
forced to cut significant bits out of my cabinet, relocating a partition,
reducing the size of a storage area and finally fitting the new fridge. Then I
go to reinstall the sink and stove that goes across the top and...Yup, she
don't fit!

The new fridge is bigger and now interferes with the sink. So I had another
stove/sink assy from the same place I got the new fridge...Wrong, too wide. So
now I'm trying to build some kind of box to raise the whole thing up enough to
fit. To top it off my girlfriend comes in and says stuff like &quot;I don't know why
you're changing it in the first place the other one worked fine...I don't think
it looks nice with the box thing there...&quot; AArggh! Women!! Not what I wanted to
hear just then...On the plus side she did happily help me pull the 1600 motor
from my parts bus, so I guess I'll keep her :-)
Anyways, at this point I was frantic and drafted a good friend of mine who is
also a woodworking genius. I also decided to go with the quick (and definite
quality) fix...Yup, more money.

Anyway the finished product looks and works beautifully. I got the fridge in.
We laid in a new wood countertop and I bought a new 2 burner stove with a
smoked glass cover and a new sink unit ($$$) and fitted them in. I will have
pictures soon if anyone is interested... While I was at it, I wired in 220VAC,
put in a new 12VDC utility light and battery meter and switch panel to control
all the electrical stuff. I also took the time to install the inline fan for my
defrosting/heating needs, but thats another post...

I guess I should say now that all this happened in the 3 weeks prior to us
leaving so I hope you can imagine how hectic things were...

Well, everything fell into place and we were able to head out on Monday the
20th of July. The first thing we needed to do as we left was stop off at my
S.O.'s dads house and pick up a tent we would be taking with us. The bus was
ruuning well at this point till I got up to about 110 KPH. Then suddenly there
was an extremely loud vibrating clatter. I hit the clutch while trying not to
panic and the noise stopped as we dropped below 100. While coasting down with
the clutch still in, I experimentally revved the engine a little to see if I
could hear anything. Sounded good! Front end and brakes felt OK too. 

I got out and checked around and found that the front license plate was loose
and was vibrating in the cross wind. A little screw driver action and that was
that. That was also the only real trouble my bus caused on the whole trip down
to Malmo, Sweden (the first leg)

This first leg down to Malmo (on the southern coast of Sweden) is about a five
hour trip from Linkoping (home base. I would be driving on a relatively warm
day and with a constant head wind so I decided to take it easy with rest stops
every couple of hours to give the engine time to cool down a bit. The bus was
pretty fully loaded with provisions as well as myself, S.O. and son, so I
wanted to be extra cautious with regards to straining my engine.

The first two hours of the ride were a bit hilly as well so I didn't want
to push things. Even with the head wind I averaged about 100 to 110 KPH while
being able to hold above 80 on all hills except one really long one. The bus
was running flawlessly. The countryside in this part of Sweden is really
beautiful with lakes, lots of small towns and the occasional historical site to
see. The highway alternates between 2 and 4 lanes. With a lot of vacationers
out hauling trailers and other RVs it got pretty crowded at times. 
I did the dip stick temp test at our first rest stop and ouch! That baby was
hot! I checked 3 times during the rest of this leg and each time it was the
same: HOT. (Advice wanted here) 

On the way down busses were unfortunately pretty scarce. We saw a couple of
older splits and some newer vanagons but nothing in our class until we got down
to &quot;Lund&quot; which is a college town close to Malmo. There, during a gas stop, we
saw a bright yellow 73+ loaf packed with college kids. They beeped and waved
and we did and both enjoyed for a minute that special communion that bus lovers
have. The rest of the trip down to Malmo was unventful and we pulled into my
S.O.s grandparents driveway very happy campers with a happy bus.

The next day was spent relaxing and making a side trip to the Oresunds bridge.
This is a huge bridge project that when finished will link Malmo,Sweden to
Copenhagen,Denmark eliminating the need to take a ferry across the straight.
The bridge itself will be about 7-8 (??) kilometers long and is one heck of a
project. I can't wait to cruise over it in the bus.

After this we finally turned towards Germany and rolled up onto the ferry that
would take us on a 7.5 hour trip to Travemunde on the German North Coast.

That's it for part I...
