Hey Y'all,
  I talked to you about a week ago about my 70 Bus and its trans 
trouble. I got a call from Todd Hill and he gave me the info that I 
needed to make the swap to the 091. I pulled the 002 and it is locked up 
internaly so I pulled the needed parts from the 002 and put them on the 
091. It went very smoothly for the most part and it works pretty good. 
Now the only problem I am having now is that the trans is a bit loud in 
all gears. Does anyone know of any additives that might quiet it down? 
Its making noise in all gears so I suspect that its the ring and pinion. 
I filled it with new oil after installing it so its not oil level. Would 
a synthetic help?
  I would like to say a big thank you to Todd Hill for calling me at 
home and giving me advice. It was only one phone call, but it was all 
the information that I needed to proceed with confidence. This list is 
great and the people on it are the best!
