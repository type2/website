For those with deep hankerings and money.
A p-mail from Canada


Do you know of any body that is
interested in double-cab transporter pick-ups; syncro and rear wheel drive,
also, a syncro Westfalia? I have these vehicles for sale.
I will send along some pictures. The syncro camper is in excellent
condition. I am asking $12,500 USD obo.
The double-cab rear wheel drive is a 5 seater, walk through in absolute
immaculate condition. Its a rich gray, that was just painted at the dealer.
I have the receipts for the past 5 years. I'm asking $15,500 USD obo. As for
the other double-cab, its a syncro, 6 seater, white in excellent condition
with 50,000 original miles. It has 2 minor dings and no rust. I'm asking
$17,000 USD obo. I am working on pictures of the white syncro, hopefully I
will have them soon. If you know of anyone interested please give them my
e-mail address or they can call me directly (780-973-3935).

Cheers,
Glen
