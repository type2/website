&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt; I pulled the motor to torque the heads and things have gone down
hill. The
motor is a 1600DP, 009, 34pict3.  Right before I pulled the motor I
rebuilt
the carb. I ran the motor for a minute or two agter the rebuild but did
not
drive the bus. BIG MISTAKE!
  &gt;&gt;

those 34-picts have issues.  Do you have a 30 or 30/31 around you could
bolt
on with and adaptor plate?  even one you could borrow? 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

I have also gone through 34/3 frustration and have resolved to always use
a 28 or 30. I just traded a bug away with a brand new 30/31 and that thing
looks more a mess than the 34 although people have posted good things
about it, I am scared of all the vacuum taps and adjustments.
