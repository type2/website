Subject: Replacement for egr bolt blue out


&gt;    I have a un-usual problem The egr system was removed from my bus and
the
&gt; bolt hole in the exhaust chamber of the heads plugged with standard bolts.

This is NOT, I repeat NOT, EGR. This is air injection from the smog pump.
EGR comes from the exhaust and flows into the intake.
The smog pump pumps fresh air into the exhaust ports to complete the burn of
the over-rich exhaust.
Any time you have holes going into the exhaust chambers, it NOT EGR.
