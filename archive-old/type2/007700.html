HI! If you really want to see vw's at Woodstock you should visit the 
original site in August. Every year thousands of loyal pilgrims 
(including myself)camp there (or down the street on another part of the 
site if we get kicked out) in remembrance of the spirit of the 
festival.There are plenty of vw's,some that people live in.It's really 
cool.This past year some people were going around talking to vw owners 
about there cars.It turns out they were German and sent to the US by VW 
to find out why Americans love VW's so much.So someone is finally 
looking at us a &quot;a cult&quot;.I don't know if I like that word.Maybe &quot;family&quot; 
is better.
