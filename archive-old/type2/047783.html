&gt; I have a 74 bus, and I was was wondering if the tab on the gas pedal that

&gt; above 60 on a hill when I have to drive on the interstate with people going 
&gt; 75 behind me. So basically I want to know if I removed this, could I give 
&gt; the engine too much gas? I am running dual kadrons if that makes a 
&gt; difference.

If you remove the tab, you will get more travel in the system, but you
probably don't need that travel.  

The throttle system is designed with excess travel built in.  The limiting
factor of the throttle motion should be at the pedal, not the carb.  If
you let the carb hit its limit stops you will be putting a lot of stress
on the throttle cable and linkage which they do not need.  this will
result in breakage.

You should adjust the throttle linkage so that the throttle butterflys are
wide open when the pedal hits the stop.  This will give you the maximum
performance with minimum strain on the linkage (which you _don't_ want to
break!)
