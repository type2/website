Subject: HELP: Anybody heard of The Buggy House?
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL


hi volks. is anyone familiar with a repair shop in LA named
&quot;The Buggy House&quot;? my girlfriend's '77 bus broke down on
the freeway yesterday, and she had it towed to this place,
since it was close. LA is about an hour away from our house
and our usual mechanic, so towing would have been too
expensive. if anybody has any knowledge about The Buggy
House, i'd appreciate it. the owner's name is Eddie, and
the shop is technically located in hollywood. please copy
me directly if you respond.

to make a long story short, the guy at the shop told my
girlfriend that the exhaust valve seats on the two left
cylinders are loose, and the head needs to be replaced on
that side. he also said the pistons may be damaged. his
estimate is $1000 parts and labor. naturally, i'm nervious
about having some guy i don't know do a grand worth of
repairs. 

cheers,
ben
