Subject: Re: [T2] Performance Mufflers for Busses

I've run QP's on Beetles quite often, with S&amp;S or
comparable headers. Hot VW's, if I remember correctly,
did an exhaust system comparo featuring a couple
different types, including both single and dual QP's.

&gt; Hey all:
&gt; 
&gt; I recently built and installed a mild performance
&gt; engine in my 71 bus.  It
&gt; has a header exhaust system, but I've been using the
&gt; old muffler from the
&gt; old engine.  I have a &quot;Fat Boy&quot; muffler, but it
&gt; won't quite fit, since the
&gt; body of the muffler hits against the moustache bar. 
&gt; I talked to the folks
&gt; at Gene Berg, and they use the &quot;quiet pack&quot; type of
&gt; muffler.  Unfortunately,
&gt; the guy I talked to at Berg didn't know much about
&gt; the performance aspects
&gt; of that type muffler.  Does anyone out there in list
&gt; land know anything
&gt; about &quot;Quiet Pack&quot; mufflers, or any other kind of
&gt; performance muffler?  I
&gt; don't want to install a muffler that's obnoxiously
&gt; loud, either.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
