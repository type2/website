&gt;I got all pipes filed true, but have encountered a

&gt;lock-tite work in a situation like this?

Locktite won't help much.  You don't have to remove the engine to make the 
repair though.  There is lots on this in the archives, but in case they are 
still not available you can either get a helicoil kit for it or tap 
oversize (9 or 10mm, I always do 10mm) and use a stepped stud.  Finding the 
stepped studs can be difficult but they are out there.
