Subject: any 1600 conversions?

Because i love the 1600 conversion on my 72 westy and when i was
contemplating the conversion to the list i got many replys..alot of negative
replys to the conversion actually..I am now curious to find people who done
the conversion and their thoughts.  I think it was the best thing i could
have done to my VW.  Just the thought of messing around with all those
vacuum lines alone gives me the willys!  The type 4 engines are so heavy i
hate pulling them, definetly need more than one person..My 1600 pulls my
westy so good i cant even feel the difference between the two engines when
im driving..maybe i would if i had a 1800 or 2 liter but the 1700 doesnt
even compare to the 1600 in my eyes..The 1600 comes out of the bus so easy,
I can put it in and remove it my self..its alot easier with two people, but
there are times when im am solo.  I wouldn't even try with the type 4s.  I
had the 1700 and parts are real hard to find, VW only ran them for 2 years
so they are pretty much extinct.  The upright engine was run for many years,
parts are everywhere from bugs and buses. No vacuum lines to mess with, no
dual carb set ups to drive you crazy.  Don't get me wrong i was real
reluctant to do the conversion to the 1600, i got a deal on a  1600Dp i
couldn't pass up from a smashed bug. I paid 100$ for a tight engine. I am
happy with my 1600 and just wanted to here from other listies..When i see
some posts asking where to get rebuilds or where to buy new type 4's i want
to say no way don't do it go 1600 save your self a 1000 bucks!! But, i dont,
i stay quiet and shake my head.
Its saturday night and just felt like rambling..sorry
