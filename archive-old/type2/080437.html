Subject: Re: [T2] fill a hole and then tap it

I got an idea.. don't know if it's the best,, but try screwing a bolt in
there with thread cutting screws (with larger threads than 3.5mm).. maybe
even put some epoxy in there too to make it hold. let the epoxy dry and then
drill out the hole and tap it.  Maybe that'll work better.

later,
MIke

&gt; The thread on a  3.5mm bolt hole in my steering wheel is stripped. In an
&gt; attempt to fix this, I pushed JB Weld into the hole, waited 24 hours, and
&gt; then gently ran a tap into it.  No luck. The first time I inserted the
&gt; bolt, the thread gave way.
&gt;
&gt; Can anyone suggest another filler or another way to tackle this problem?
