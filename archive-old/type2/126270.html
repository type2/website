Subject: RE: VW - Corvair

Honestly - with some good pics and measurements you can build your own kit for less than the kit price. 

Any muffler shop worth it's salt can bend you a cross member (you supply heavier wall tubing - don't use muffler pipe) and the rest is steel rod (shifter) and 3/16&quot; steel for any brackets. You'll need access to a welder or someone who can do it for you. 

So far the hardest thing for me has been fabricating the tin as I am trying to fit the engine to the bus rather than fitting the bus to the engine in case I want to go back to VW power (in case my &quot;original&quot; bus is suddenly worth $50K... Don't see it happening!!! &lt;grin&gt;)

Every once in a while I will hear about a used kit on eBay or through the &quot;VirtualVairs&quot; Corvair list. That is how I found my NOS kit (old but unused). 

I'd be glad to shoot you a pile of digi pics and send you a CD. I already have another fellow waiting and it is no more trouble to make 2 discs than 1 disc. I'd also be glad to take measurements for you of anything you want.

It promises to be an exciting ride once I get this thing done. FWIW the conversion doesn't take the 4 months it has taken me (actual work period), I'm playing &quot;single Dad&quot; while my wife is working 80+ hours a week student teaching / working full time. I only get a few hours during the week to work in the evenings.

The whole project should only take a long weekend to install once everything is clean, painted, repaired, etc. to suit your tastes.

See ya.

Well, well, well...... Would you believe I came across a 1974 VW Camper in
reasonably good shape missing the VW engine/ trans.
