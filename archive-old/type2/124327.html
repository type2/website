&gt; What a waste of gas and what an environmental nuissance! Just think about
&gt; all the gas you burned without getting any use out of it.

&gt; I don't argue for full throttle on a cold engine, but rather for warm-up
in
&gt; traffic without being unnecessarily hard on the engine before it has
reached
&gt; operating temperature.

Absolutely correct.  You get in you car, you start it up, and you gently
drive away.  A mile or so of &quot;in the neighborhod&quot; driving will be sufficient
warm up so, when you hit the freeway, everything's fine.

To avoid getting a lot of condensation and pollutants in your oil just be
sure to get the engine completely warmed up every few startups; take a
little 20 - 30 minute trip at freeway speeds or something similar.
