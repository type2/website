Mick,

Take them back to your tire guy and upgrade them to the  Michelin *Agilis*
185 R 14 Cs  with a  rating of (1750 lbs) .... George said: These just may
be the *Holy Grail* of bus tires!  I  have put them on 3 different busses.
We  run them at 35 in front and 40 in the rear with an excellent
ride...........

&gt; I followed the tyre thread but have a question now after deviating from
the
&gt; norm.
&gt; Michelin Classic, 185 R14 C, looking OK.
&gt; But 8 ply (1875 lbs) vs. 6 ply (1540 lbs) so appeared well specified.
&gt; But the legend on the tyres say1875 lbs _at_ 65 psi cold.
&gt; This is well away from the VW text of 30lbs front, 37lbs rear.
&gt; Do I use 65 psi and have a hard ride or guess at 50 psi and run these
tyres
&gt; underinflated ?
&gt; I reckon these are light truck tyres and a further legend says North
America
&gt; or Australia !
&gt; Any offers on which way to jump ?
