Subject: Posting an ebay ad to the list

Dear Sir: A couple of days ago I posted an ad from ebay for a 1971 bay
window crewcab pickup parts car thinking that these are fairly rare and
somebody on the list might be interested. This was not my ad and I do
not stand to make any money on it. I received an email with the words
&quot;banned from the list&quot; in it. Are such listings Verboten ( forbidden)
on the list, or was the sender out of line? Thanks,
Tim &quot;hawaii-bus-boy&quot;   In my fleet:
1971 Ex-Westfalia &quot;Houston&quot;                     1977 Kombi   &quot;Portland&quot;
1964 BMW R50/2  &quot;Afrika&quot;
