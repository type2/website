&gt;Didn't VW Trends go out of print once before?  In the 80's?  Certainly I may

&gt;memory of this, but I think it did.

According to VWTrends groupies:

This isn't the first time VW Trends disappeared. They published 1 issue in 1976, followed by 3 issues in 1977. They then disappeared until October 1980 and lasted for 10 issues until the &quot;Winter 1981&quot; issue. They reappeared on the scene with the March 1984 issue and have been monthly since then.
