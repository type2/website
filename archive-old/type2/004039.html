The FI pancake engines don't have a &quot;pre-heater&quot; set-up of any sort.
There's essentially 3 &quot;cold start/cold run&quot; components on these
things:

1) Cold-start/thermo-time switch.  This supplies extra gas while
cranking the engine when the engine's cold.  It helps on start-up but
has no function once the engine's running.

2) Temp sensor II in the left head.  This sends a signal to the ECU
telling the ECU's &quot;the engine's cold&quot; which results in the ECU
increasing the pulse width of the firing of the injectors.

3) Auxiliary Air Valve.  When the engine's cold this valve is open,
sending extra (metered) air to the engine over and above what's
supplied by the idle air circuit.  Kind of like keeping your foot on
the gas peddle a little bit.  As the engine warms the Aux Air Valve
closes.

Sounds like the problem could be in the Aux Air Valve.

&gt; I've seen some replies to this post but they all seem to focus on
the
&gt; second half (battery problem) instead of the no-idle/bucking
problem --
&gt; which doesn't sound like a battery problem.
&gt;
&gt; Not sure what kind of preheating is done on a 72 pancake engine, but
I
&gt; know I've had uprights behave like this when the preheat pipe was
&gt; clogged or the air-cleaner preheater setup was gone.  In fact my '71
is
&gt; doing that now.  This doesn't sound like a fuel delivery problem to
me,
&gt; especially if the bus starts right back up after it stalls.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone else care to comment on the FIRST problem?

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have a 72 bus and I have been having problems with it recently.
When it
&gt; &gt; gets real cold out the bus rarely idols it just dies.  So at a
stop light I
&gt; &gt; have to constantly keep my foot on the gas the car also bucks a
lot when I'm
&gt; &gt; moving mostly starting off in first or when I change gears and the
engine is
&gt; &gt; at a low rpm.  I've been dealing with this problem ever since it
got cold out
