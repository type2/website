One of the wires should dim the back lighting when the headlights are
turned on. Given the descriptions, I'm not certain how to begin to
guess. You might wire up all but those two and see what that buys you.
The back lighting should be covered by the main power to the system. I
suppose it may require both positive and ground to activate the dimmer
when the headlights are engaged.
