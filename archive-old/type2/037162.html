Subject: If I ever meet the PO responsible...

Well, after mulling over the compression results, and looking at the
overall appearance of the engine (nasty, oily mess), I decided to pull
the engine and get ready for an overhaul. Here's what I found :-(

1) Somebody had mounted the clamps that hold the right side heater cable
upside down, and unlike the description in both Muir and Wilson, it was
a screw, not a bolt. Imagine trying to hold a stubby screwdriver
backward held up at a gawd-awful angle - grrr. At least I was able to
get it out without giving up and cutting the cable - they'll definitely
be put back in the right way!

2) The upper left stud holding the tranny to the engine was literally
hanging by a thread. The nut on the bottom left stud was gone - so,
there was nothing holding the engine to the tranny on the left side :-(.
I guess I shouldn't have been surprised when I found all sorts of metal
shavings all over the flywheel... how bad is this going to be?

3) The right hand crossmember bracket (the part on the body) was
replaced at some point, with some nonsensical bracket that actually
stuck into the crossmember (the left side mount rested on top of the
bracket - I assume this is the normal bracket), meaning that the whole
engine assembly had to be shifted to the left to be removed - THIS IS
NOT EASY! Sorry, that needed to be yelled.

Anyway, it's out now, so I can start disassembly. I am kind of concerned
about the quantity of those shavings - think it'll be obvious what they
came from? Anything I should look at more closely than others?

Thanks for giving me a place to vent :-) At least the manuals were
_extremely_ useful for the process. I defintely felt like I knew what I
was doing!
