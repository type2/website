Subject: ATE brake pads $18.95

I got five more pair of the original-equipment ATE brake pads for '73-85
busses &amp; vanagons, at the &quot;steal&quot; price of $18.95 a pair that I posted a
couple of weeks ago.  These look to be the last I'll see at this price.

Also on this shipment were three sets of ATE's that fit '71-72 busses.  Same
price.
