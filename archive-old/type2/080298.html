--part1_16d.7af1ac4.2982173d_boundary

I was driving my 66 bus in 20/30 mph winds coming home from Newport. I got 
pulled over and was given a sobriety test for weaving across the road. I mean 
touch your nose and hop on one foot and everything. I started laughing when I 
realized what was going on. I told the cop to try driving the bus in that 
much crosswind and handed him my keys. He said no thanks and let me go.
