Subject: Re: [T2] Vintage Vehicle Valuation &amp; Appraisals

Appraisal may be best protection. My friend had her split totalled
recently. She was able to establish value by comparable sales on ebay
and samba, as well as faxing lots of receipts for the repairs she paid
for. Your potential case may not go as easily.
