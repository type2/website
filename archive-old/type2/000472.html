Subject: Dead Bus on I-80 at Tipton Rest Stop

Yesterday driving home from the Inlaws I stopped at the Tipton Iowa rest
stop.  There was a red 68-70 bus broken down with the right rear wheel and
drum off.  The van had California plates and was loaded with stuff.  If
anybody has heard any pleas for help from Iowa, have him contact me.  Wife
wouldnt let me stop and look for the guy (midnight and I guess she had seen
it on Friday.)
