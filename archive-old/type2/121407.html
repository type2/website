&gt;Amazing, too that our '01 Mazda MPV (one of the most fuel efficient vans on

&gt;&quot;engineering marvels&quot; over the past 40 years.

You are overlooking key facts, including that your MPV engine spews *much* 
less pollution, generates tree times the HP and torque, and pushes a 
vehicle loaded with convenience and (mostly mandatory) safety features that 
add considerable mass.  Your MPV weighs 1000 lbs more than a 1967   VW 
bus.  Just the pollution reduction alone is amazing.  If you want better 
fuel economy in the MPV rip off out the structural crossbeams for crash 
protection, the air bags, the insulation and sound deadening material, air 
conditioning,heater fan, power windows, yadda yadda yadda, to make it more 
comparable to your bus.  Then realize that a 5 mpg is a 25% improvement 
(going from 20 mpg to 25 mpg).  And I won't even go into the lower 
maintenance factor (when was the last time the MPV had the valves adjusted, 
or the spark plugs replaced, or the radiator fluid changed?)

All greenies should sell their buses and by a Honda Insight or a Toyota 
Prius (or a VW Golf TDI, particularly once the US lowers the sulfur content 
of diesel fuel in the US).

I don't mean to knock the Bus or classic cars in general (or start a flame 
war), but the reality is today's engines are amazingly clean burning and 
maintenance free compared to engines of 40 years ago.  But that doesn't 
keep me from driving my bus on a regular basis.
