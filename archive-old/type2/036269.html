Subject: RE:  34's on a 2.0 liter?

&gt;attention pancake lovers - has anyone tried Weber 34's on the 2.0 liter 
&gt;bus engine? i'm debating between 34's and 40's. my goal is improved 
&gt;efficiency (running a weber prog now) but enough HP to get over the 
&gt;mtn passes. any thoughts?

If you really want the best economy and power at the same time, you'd do
best to re-install the original fuel injection (as Bob mentioned).  I don't
have any experience with the baby Webers (34's), but my initial guess is
that you can't run a big enough venturi to get optimal power from a 2.0.  

I do have a lot of experience with dual 40 and 44 IDF's on type IV motors.
When set up properly (ie. install the CORRECT venturis and jets, not just
use the ones supplied with the off-the-shelf kits) you can get more power.
But it is at the cost of fuel economy.  I ran my 73 Westy with 1800 motor
for many years with a pair of 44 IDF's, then several more years with a pair
of 40's and I can say from experience that power is good.  But the best mpg
I EVER got was about 18.0 and that was only on trips when I kept my highway
speeds below 70 mph.  Around town and on faster highway trips (75 mph), I
typically got 16.5.
