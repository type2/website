Subject: part needed: headlight switch 71-79

I'm looking for a replacement headlight switch (mine burn out).  Must be 
oem.  I've had a reproduction and it sucks.  If anybody has one they can 
part with please p-mail.  p/n on back is 211941531B has six connectors. 
 I have the knob.

thanks

elijah
