&gt; Daniel,
&gt;
&gt; I would suggest the classic test...  do a compression check.  If the
&gt; compression is high, then suspect bad valve guides.  If it is low, but a
&gt; shot of oil helps it, then suspect rings.  If it is very low on one or
&gt; more cylinders and oil does not help, the problem is valves.
&gt;
&gt; Also, there is a test called a leakdown test that tests the integrity of
&gt; your rings and valves.  The device to perform it is common in shops, but
&gt; beyond the means of most home mechanics.  Check with mechanics near you to
&gt; see if any have the necessary equipment.

But.....if the compression rings are good and the oil control rings are bad, a
leakdown test will show good rings. If the oil control rings are leaving too
much oil on the walls, no test will show that. The oil control rings control the
amount of oil left on the walls to lube the compression rings.
