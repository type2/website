Subject: 73 Transporter

I just bought a 1973 Transporter.  I have owned several Bugs, but have
had no dealings with this type.  My question is:  this thing has a
factory(?) air conditioner.  I am guessing that is it factory because
most of the instructions are in German.  The engine is in two boxes and
the compressor is not there.  Where might I even start to hunt for such
a thing?  It needs piles of work and I am excited about getting
started.  I only gave $40 for it at an estate sale.  No rust, 4 flats,
just one bench seat, and, like I said, an engine in 1,000,001 pieces.
Where do I start???  Thanks!
Brian Hayes
