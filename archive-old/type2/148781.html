Subject: 72 bus drivers side window roller removal?

roller suddenly broke (gear not engaging teeth fully, would just grind
when I turned the handle)...  Window was easy to roll up/down prior to
this, no warning of it failing..

I pulled the panel, unbolted the roller, unbolted the carrier that
connects to the glass...

I can get the roller assembly to move in the door, but it is caught
near the edge of the opening (bottom of glass when window is
closed)...

I pull it one way, the roller gets stuck in this pinch-point

I pull it the other way, and the carrier (that bolts to glass) gets stuck...

do I have to cut this out?  Was it Pressed in?

Jen
