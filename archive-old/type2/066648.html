Subject: Turn Light On Always, 12V 1965 Bus, Re-wired

Hello All,

I just replaced the fuse box in my 65 bus.  I'm adding two gauges so 
I thought I would check out the fuses and wiring while I was at it.

The PPO converted this to 12V.  I thought I had everything wired up 
right, and it seems to work ok, except the turn signal light glows 
dimly all of the time, except when the ignition key is turned to on 
(then the light goes out and everything is ok).  The other weird 
thing is that the emergency flashers work normally when the key is 
on, but the fuel gauge pings on and off with the flashers when the 
key is off.

I've got the Bentley manual, but the wiring diagrams are in 
black-and-white, not the glorious color that people have referred to. 
 Is this normal?  Is there a source for the color diagram.

Another question:  according to the diagram, there should be two 
wires from the flasher to the fuse box - I can only find one.  Do I 
need to find another wire, or is it not needed with the conversion to 
12V?

Thanks,

Greg
