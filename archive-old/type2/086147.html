Subject: RE: [T2] Bus upholstery

&gt; I would like to hear from those that have bought kits
&gt; (from who and how much$$$) and your satisfaction
&gt;  with the kit.


Unless you're looking for custom stuff (i.e. Sewfine), TMI is pretty much
the only supplier of &quot;original style&quot; bus upholstery.  So no matter where
you buy it (and prices vary greatly), it's likely that you'll get TMI
upholstery.  Even the custom upholstery suppliers like Sewfine typically
ship TMI as their entry-level stuff.  But this isn't neccessarily a bad
thing; I have had no problems with TMi's fit and quality.
