&gt; to visits from the very scary Lurch.  Lurch first attacked us only hours 
&gt; after meeting.  We were on the Interstate during a 5 hour trip (3 hours in). 
&gt;   My headlights would dim, and I would lose nearly all power until finally 

&gt; Lately the bus has been sputtering on acceleration (while making a chirpy 
&gt; sound through the exhaust) and LURCH joined us once again tonight on the way
