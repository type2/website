&gt;What is the correct distrib for the type IV in a T2?  I've got a '77 that I just
&gt;got, my first, and I'm a T2 virgin.  Had T1's for a while and 009 ok (except with
&gt;the 34PICT carb).
&gt;
&gt;Regards,

&gt;&gt; &gt; not possible with the 009 and having a setting of 7.5 BTDC. At that setting
&gt;&gt; &gt; the 009 only goes to 28 degrees. So, I've always had 7.5 BTDC static timing.
&gt;&gt; &gt;     Today I got to thinking about the advice given to me earlier in the
&gt;&gt; &gt; year. &quot;Set the timing at 32 degrees at full advance....&quot; I know if I do
&gt;&gt; &gt; this, the static timing goes to 11 ish.
&gt;&gt; &gt;    I figure if anyone knows, someone has to know here. What's everyone elses
&gt;&gt; &gt; take on this???
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I made the same mistake when I got my first type IV engine...you will
&gt;&gt; NEVER be able to get a 009 to work well with this engine.. bite the bullet
&gt;&gt; look long and hard, search auction sites, but get by hook or whatever the
&gt;&gt; correct dizzy for that engine. the difference is amazing
