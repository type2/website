Subject: Dropped seats

Volks,

If my valves were dropping seats, would the adjusters have more threads on
the outside of the nut, or less threads on the outside of the nut?

In other words, would the valves themselves (and thus the seats) be moving
towards the pistons or away from the pistons?

TIA,

Matt
