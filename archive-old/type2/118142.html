Subject: screen clips revisited

heavens to betsy its the friday question we've all been waiting for. both
my screens (75 westy) are rattling big time since the plastic clips dried
out and crumbled.  i remember the list discussing the latch type for
holding screens tight but i can't recall mention of the clip on - clip in
style. has anyone a source for these, or spares from the yards?
 - steve
