 Hi Volks,

&gt; ... A friend on mine stopped as I was standing by it on the side

&gt; broke down on the side of the road&quot; its funny cause its true.

 Huh? I've been driving type-2s since 1981, riding in my parent's ones
since before I was born and as far as I can recall I've called out a tow
once (dropped valve: my fault for taking Muir at his word) and maybe
two or three times my bus hasn't started when I wanted it to.
 I think my mum called the AA once for a broken clutch cable, we could
have carried on, of course, but the van was fully loaded and we were
about to drive onto a car ferry...

 In the UK VW have a long running advertising campaign &quot;Isn't it a pity
everything in life isn't as reliable as a Volkswagen&quot;. This has passed
into general conversation.

 That's one of the major plus points of a bus for me- you turn the key
and it goes. I always get a kick out of cruising by a nearly-new,
watercooled car that's dead at the roadside.
 Now if you'd said MG, or Triumph..
 
Cheers,
	W.
