Subject: Two Busses heading to Ecology in Wilmington CA
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Heads up SoCal Listees.

I was at the Long Beach auto auction today and spotted two busses (69 and late
70's).  Was told that they attempted to auction them off before christmas went
No Bid and now Ecology/Wilmington has bought the lot.  Should be over there real
soon.  I couldn't get close to check out but from what I could see, both were
fairly complete and without any TC damage.

FWIW, either of these busses could have been had for a starting bid of $100.  No
one wanted them so off to Ecology they go.

Scott
