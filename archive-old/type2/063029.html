Subject: Police Checkpoint

Well, I made it through my first police checkpoint this morning.  I was driving
to school this morning, I came over a hill and there were two policemen 
stopping every car.  I tried to figure out what was going on?  Too early in the
morning for a DWI checkpoint,  too far from any prisons to be an excaped
prisoner,  to far from my college to be a drug thing,  it was raining so it
must have been important.  I knew I didn't have anything in my bus so I wasn't
worried about that but I didn't want to be late to class.  They gestured for
me to stop.  My brakes gave their usual high pitced squeal, the cop said it 
sounds like I need new brakes, I said they were just cheap pads, he said I 
could go, I said whats up, he said routine check point, I said have a nice
day
and went on.  He didn't even try to look in back.  His buddy was checking the
junk in the back of an old rusty toyota next to me.  So a happy ending.
