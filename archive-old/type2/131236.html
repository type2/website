Subject: oil pump replacement?

I need some direction on weather I need to replace my Oil Pump with a &quot;heavy
duty&quot; pump from Bus Depot.
I have a 1968 Westy with a 1600dp motor using Castrol 20w-50 dino. The system
has been upgraded with a 1.5Qt. sump, external cooler and an external filter.
The new total capacity is between 6 and 7 quarts and I am running a stock oil
pump with the one passage tapped and plugged. I have also replaced the relief
valve springs to help the pressure. When I first start up the pressure runs
about 55-60# and after driving 55mph approx. 3000rpm for 30 min the pressure
drops to approx 30# which concerns me. I am use to at least 10# of pressure
per 1000 rpms and when I push it up to 60-65mph at approx. 3500-3600 rpm the
pressure is maybe 32#.  After reading the recent info on running the 1600's
hard (3800rpms) I can't help to think the pressure is too low. I am thinking
that by replacing the stock unit with either a 26mm or 30mm &quot;heavy duty&quot; pump
this will help push the oil through the system more efficiently causing the
pressure to improve. The motor does not seem to be leaking oil or burning oil
and the dash oil light does not come on at any time.
