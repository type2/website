That would depend upon your point of view.  One person's female dog is
another's pleasant afternoon task.  You need to get a kit that consists of
the pin and bushings.  You make a tool (instructions are in the Library)
using some all-thread, washers, and a couple of sockets.  You use the tool
to pull the bushings out of the arm and to install the new bushings.  Put
in the new pin and you're in business.  No reaming required on late buses!

This job can be done with big hammers, chisels and blue language, but it's
a lot easier with a little thought and toolmaking.  Tools are what
separate us from the apes!
