I have heard (but not seen) that early
busses had cloth headliners.  
What's the scoop on them?
Difficulty of installation of replacement?
Color match of aftermarket varieties?
The one in question has a Como Green interior.
Differences between cloth and vinyl versions?
When did VW change from one to the other?
Is there no difference, except for perception?
Why is there air?  (hint, its for a sunroof opening)

vinyl headliners were first used for 64 model.    63 and earlier microbuses
were made with cloth headliners.  I am told they are easier to install than
vinyl.   repros are made, I don't know much about them.   I like the cloth,
except I find the green tint headliner in the turqouise/white 64s a beautiful
compliment to the como green interior.    There were different colours used on
cloth headliners over the years, but I am not clear on that.  If it came with
a como green interior, it would be a 61-63.  What year is it?
