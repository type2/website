Subject: smoked alternator

Everybody says how easy VW's are to work on, I guess they haven't removed an
alternator from a loaf lately.  The alternator on my 69 Westy is having
diode problems I think.  The red light came on the other night (the belt was
fine)and by the time I got home, my headlights were very dim and the wipers
barely moving.  I replaced the battery (it was due anyway) and when I hooked
up the new one, the alternator started smoking.  I immediately unhooked it
and scratched my head. I have called some local auto electric shops and they
seem to think it's probably an internal short or diode problem.  Is it
really as hard to remove the alternator as Bentley describes it?  Is is
something a weekend mechanic can do with limited tools or should I visit my
friendly VW mechanic?
