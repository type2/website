Hy guys

I have been reading the last days post about the pop-up tent replacement =
, and I ask myself and to the list, if there is anybody else making =
there own tent ?. In my oppinion, cutting and sewing a tent, must be =
much easier than to assemble an engine.
I am in the proccess of restoring (a tight budget project) my 1977 =
Westy, after disassembling the whole thing, to replace the carpet, =
repair some rust spot, and painting the bus, I decided to replace the =
tent too. After a short search I found the prices for a replacement =
where very high to fit in my budget, so I took a piece of acrylic canvas =
(a left over of my boat project) and after that I took the tent off , I =
cut all the seams and dissasembled it, put it in the washing machine and =
then ironed to straitenght it, I used it as a pattern then I took it to =
an upholstery shop to be saw again.
I am not instaling it back yet but I think it is going be fine.
Yes I know that sounds as a lot af work but that is why we are here :-).
