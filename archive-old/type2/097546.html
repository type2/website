Subject: Re: [T2] 1600 DP in a 73 Westy, how will it perform?

&gt; I've got someone that's interested in buying my 73 Westy but they have a
&gt; 1600DP that they want to put in the bus rather than the 2.0 that I have
with
&gt; it.

WHAT, are they crazy? For power and performance I would stay with the 2.0.
or is the engine blown?


&gt;They are wondering though how the bus will do with that engine.

one word... SLUG
