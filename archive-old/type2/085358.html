&gt; Any ideas on what would cause a yellow gunk to be deposited on both
&gt; the oil cap and funnel as well as inside the crankcase breather tube?
&gt; 79 2L if that matters.

This is a mixture of oil and water (some people call it mayonnaise but I
wouldn't recommend it with a salad).  It's caused by running lots of short
trips when the engine doesn't get up to full temperature for long enough.
Cure - treat your bus to a nice day out, it'll thank you for it.  I take it
you have the thermostat and flaps installed?...
