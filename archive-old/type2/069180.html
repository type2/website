&gt; 
&gt;       Please excuse the ignorance. Can someone tell me 
what a &quot;Kombi&quot; is?
&gt; 

Kombi is short for KOmbination it is one of VW's more 
utilitarian busses essentially a Panel Van w/ windows. It 
has/had no interior panels/headliner in the rear.

It could be ordered with or without seats or with or without 
a sunroof.

The seats were easily removeable making it capable of 
carrying cargo very easily.

shape?
