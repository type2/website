Both rear wheels are right hand threads.  You should be able to see enough
of the threads to verify this.

Be sure that the rear wheels are on the ground, the wheel is blocked,  and
that you have a friend applying the brake pedal before you start cranking
on the thing!

&gt; Before I do myself an injury, can anybody confirm which way I have to turn
&gt; the nut on the right hand side of the bus, to get it off. I know some
&gt; commercial vehicles have anticlockwise threads on wheel nuts, so might this
&gt; apply here?
