Subject: Lead vs No-Lead

Seeing as I dropped a valve seat (well, my bus did actually) I was
wondering what effect the unleaded regular gas has on older heads.  I know
that the lead was in gas to lube the valves, and wondered if the lack of
lead in new gas could cause this kind of failure.  I'm not looking to
blame anyone, as I probably needed new heads anyway, butjust curious.
