Subject: RE: [T2] Leaky Valve Covers

&gt;From: Richard Atwell

&gt;I don't normally correct list spelling but according to Merriam-Webster, 
&gt;it's spelled bail:


That is quite alright Richard. Coming from you I take it in stride much like 
a defining mystical part number from Karl. As of lately I have been 
corrected all over the Type II list. Also for many different reasons 
spelling, content, non-content, acts agaisnt the charter, religious 
difference, morality, politics, humor, non-humor, etc.

I am working on how to impliment chauvanism, activism and terrorism for 
triple negative score, while still including Bus-Content. I was always good 
at Scabble although I misspelled in my last post. ;-)

Bus Content = Richard. Anyone who is on the List for long will understand 
this. If you are a newbie or have not been here long just see his webpage.
