Subject: Re: [T2] Curiousity, Westy to Sunroof

Good to hear from either way. I think I still am going to need those Heat 
Exchangers if you still have them. Within the next two weeks. I forgot that 
I pusuaded the owner of the bus I working on that he definately needs them 
and he agreed.

Thanks,
