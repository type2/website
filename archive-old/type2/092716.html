I assume you've backed off the brake pads a bit more than necessary??

Tap around and pull, tap around and pull.  You might have to heat up
the drum with a torch.  That's what finally did it for me, on one that
just WOULDN'T come off.

&gt;Is there a easy trick for getting those rubber dust plugs back in?

Soften them in boiling water, dry off, and stick 'em on in there.
If they've become too hard to be boiled soft, it's time to replace them.
