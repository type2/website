Subject: gas tank/fuel sender clues

Folks,

I am pulling my engine and gas tank tomorrow.

78 t2 std trans

Does the fuel sender hole face the front or rear of the vehicle.

If the tank is &quot;square&quot; does the sender come out of the top?

The point is, if it faces the rear or top, can I get it out with the fuel
tank still in the car and feel around inside the tank before I have to 
take the whole thing out?...yes, I am lazy...if I can feel around inside
the tank without having to pull it, then maybe I can figure out what is 
covering the hole to the fuel pump and just take it out.

On the other hand, if such a thing is possible, and I feel all sort of
gunk in there, then I won't mind pulling it all anyway.

I just have visions of pulling everything only to find a pristine looking
tank with a piece of saran wrap or something similar floating around in
it.....probably not a chance in hell, but I gotta ask.

Cheers, dave
