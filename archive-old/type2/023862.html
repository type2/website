Subject: Alarm fitters in London ?

Having just had a respray done to my van I need to up the agreed value of
the insurance. This will bring it over the limit where I need to fit some
kind of alarm.

Does anyone have any recommendations of an alarm fitting firm in London I
could use (I'm afraid I wouldn't have a clue how to do it myself). Also what
type of alarm to fit. It's a 79 Camper and should have an agreed value of
£4000-£4500

Thanks in advance for any help.

Cheers


Woodg
'79 Camper, Daisy
