CHT yes, mine too.  But what about oil temperature?  I think that's where
the problem is.

&gt;&gt; Do you have a 4100lb bus?  Do you live in Dallas?  Do you ever drive your
&gt;&gt; bus long enough or fast enough to really heat it up?  Your oil temp may not
&gt;&gt; be too hot but your CHT seems high.  500?  Mine has never seen anywhere
&gt;&gt; near that temperature, even when I had the sender mounted at the spark plug.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;    4100lb? What do you carry in that thing? My Westy is only 3400lb
&gt;empty.

100 lbs of golf cart batteries, two air conditioners, floor jack,
subwoofer, canned food, compressor-style refrigerator, dutch oven, etc.
It's also a highroof.  Weighed 4100 lbs loaded with my girlfriend and I in
it, and neither of us are large people.

And I drive 14 freeway (75mph) miles each way to work, which
&gt;seems to get it just as hot as it ever gets on longer trips. My cyl temp
&gt;sender is mounted on #3 sparkplug, it -- until my unfortunate problem
&gt;with the fan hub key shearing -- never went over 450 max, ususally
&gt;around 350-400.

My mistake, I thought you said it was over 500, but I guess that was just
when you had the fan hub problem.  With all due respect, a flat 14 mile
drive is not going to heat up your engine very much.  Mine never gets over
220 on a similar commute, even on the hottest days.  But last year I pulled
a 4000ft grade in 110 degree heat (Southeastern California in August,
Westbound I-8) that caused my oil temp to hit 250, even when I geared down
and took it relatively easy.  250 is at the very high end of what I
consider safe even with 15W50 synthetic oil.  I don't think I would have
made it over that hill with no engine seal.

&gt;I've also noticed that outside temp doesn't seem to have any real
&gt;bearing on the engine temp -- I was getting the same temps in Wisconsin
&gt;in the winter -- it took a bit longer to get there maybe, but summer or
&gt;winter head temp seems just the same.

I see the same thing with head temp, but I don't pay very much attention to
CHT.  I am more concerned with oil temperature, since that's where I seem
to get close to dangerous temperatures.  CHT just tells me when I need to
drop down a gear, or in the extreme case it will let me know if the fan
stops turning, as you are well aware.  But for staying &quot;in touch&quot; with the
engine, I don't think CHT is that important.  Oil pressure, oil temp, and
vacuum are much more useful.
