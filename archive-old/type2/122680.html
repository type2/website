FWIW, the locking caps are still available from the dealer, but they'll 
probably have to order it (I bought one over the Christmas holiday).  
If you can find the part number for the non-locking, the dealer might 
be able to order that one, too.  The locking cap ran me $53.50.  I 
would think the non-locking would be a lot less (though, it is the 
dealer, so I could be wrong :-)
