Subject: Re: [T2] battery to choose?Size 24 Battery  (gel cells)

My comments regarding gel cell batteries are based on
the requirement that they not be allowed to reach
&quot;gassing&quot; voltage, which a simple regulator (like a VW
bus has) would not control. They seem to be very
sensitive to overcharging.
I'm just going on what I learned from talking to
battery people and reading Johnson Controls (if I
remember correctly) battery information brochures.
If there are gel cells made specifically for auto use
without restrictions as to the vehicle, then I guess
it is the battery company's problem if there are
problems while the battery is under warranty.
If people like George are using them with no problems,
that sounds like a good recommendation to me.
