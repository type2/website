Subject: Clutch?

Hi All,

I have a broken e-brake and have been bad about
getting it fixed.  But this may be an irony as now I
noticed a problem:
When I park on a hill and leave the Bus in gear it
creeps downhill! It's never done this before, but I
just got back from a long drive to and from Seattle to
San Francisco. There are several mountains between
there and here, so I did a lot of shifting. I'm not
getting any slipping from the clutch when it's moving.
Does anyone know why my bus would creep like this so I
can get it fixed BEFORE I get stranded.

My bus is a 1972 westy, &quot;california&quot;

Thanks,

Rae
