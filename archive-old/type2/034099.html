&gt; &gt;  how is everybody
&gt; &gt; cleaning out their heat risers.

The heat riser plugs up directly under the carb, where it is coldest. 
To clear this area, I used a Dremel tool to open a 1/8 hole in the
front (FIF) side of the heat riser where I could get a straight shot at
the offending blockage under the carb.  

I then took a piece of 1/8 gas welding rod, hammered a flat scraper
shape on the end, bent it slightly so that it would scrape the side of
the tube, chucked the rod into the same Dremel tool, and had at it.  
Took a few seconds to break through the clog, and it was truly amazing
the amount of carbon that trickled out the ends of the riser.  

I then used a stainless hose clamp and a dab of red silicone to seal
the hole.

With this arrangement, It's easy to clean out the tube whenever the
manifold is off the engine.  No problems with cables
unraveling/jamming/breaking inside the tube either.
