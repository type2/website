Subject: 71 VW Camper &amp; gonna be in WA state end of May

I found a 61 Camper advertized w/ no engine and air conditioning for
500...had to call.  Found out it's a 71 with a heater (when i looked in
the back)  Has a fold down 3 section bed in the back and a plaid bed?
under the tip up section of the camper.  It's also a walk through w/o
front seats.  The signals are cracked as is the windshield, but the rest
of the windows are good.  He would like to trade it for and engineless
baja that I have...Yeah!!!!!!
Oh yeah, has 5 tires and nose mounted spare.  I don't need another
project, but I wanted to save it...and get rid of the baja.
Anyone willing to trade early bus stuff for it? or buy it outright from
me?  I'll take pictures soon, but I have a ton of stuff to do involving
legal matters in WA.

I'll be going to WA around the end of the month.  Driving a Jeep.  Anyone
 on the I-5 wanna talk/meet?  How about some o you Sea-Tac crowd?

Tschuss!
