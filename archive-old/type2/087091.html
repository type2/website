you need to use the &quot;Green&quot; book of clasic and older car values, check
your local library

&gt; Talking with my insurance people today I found out
&gt; that they pay 'book' value only in event of a loss.

Bull hockey, what they pay is negotiated and you have the right to refuse
thier &quot;offer&quot;  the books are only guides not diffinitive, also if you have
records of major work like new tires, engine etc this affects the value
