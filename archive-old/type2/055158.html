Subject: no title for my bus


&gt;When I bought my camper , it was from some Antique auto dealer and all I
got
&gt;was a bill of sale and no title. He said it wouldn't be a problem. Is there
&gt;any reason why I would have a problem (like registering it when I get it
all
&gt;fixed up) Why is the title important???
&gt;Dave you don't say  where you are located, but I imagine rules vary state
to state. I did this recently in Arizona. (1) call motor vehicle division to
find out what you have to do. They'll run a check on VIN to see who vehicle
was last registered to. You send that person a certified mail asking about
title. If the don't answer within 14 days, the letter will be returned. (2)
call motor vehicles to have vehicle inspected--do NOT do any repairs until
after inspection. (3) Go to friendly local insurance and buy vehicle bond :
mine cost $50 for $1500 est. value of vehicle. (4) Go to license bureau with
all papers; receive new title and registration.
