Subject: Re: [T2] Performance and/or Stainless Steel Exhaust for 72-74  and/or 79-83 vans

I had the GT system on my bus that exits via two chrome tip pipes. I really liked the look, but the dang thing has only lasted about a year and 3 months or so before something goes wrong and breaks on it. I bought mine from RMMW and paid a little more but with their lifetime warranty I am on my second replacement. They stand behind their warranty as far as my experience. Maybe if it was sand blasted and sprayed with some high temp paint it would last better.  I am now going to try a S&amp;S header (www.ssheaders_dot_com) and a empi single muffler. I will keep the GT style sys for backup.
