&gt; it is simply astounding what is available over there.
&gt; Check it out, maybe we should consider group ordering some of this stuff
&gt; if US vendors don't want to make it available.  Why the heck  isn't this
stuff
&gt; coming over here?


Some of it is.  I have a container coming in about a month that will have
the full rear corners and some other goodies.  I deal with some of the same
sources Schofield deals with in Europe, so I can get some of the items
listed on their website (and at better prices).
