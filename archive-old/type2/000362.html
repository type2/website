Brad,
	You might want to contact Robert Keezer at WarmerWagen_at_aol_dot_com in the
Seattle area.  He's a great guy and really knows these heating systems.  He
also rebuilds and installs them.  No connection except as a satisfied
customer.

Hope this helps,
Mark
82 Westy

Subject:	[T2] BA6 gas heater question/problem

Hello everyone.  I've got a 1976 westy with a BA6 heater.  My problem is
this: When I fire up the heater, it starts, heats up, blows good heat, but
then shuts down shortly thereafter.  I have done a bit of research, and will
be looking at the heater this weekend, so I am looking for any input from
the list.

I am thinking that the problem is possibly that 1) the overheating fuse has
blown (the heater has done this since I've owned for the past four years,
since its parked in the winter, so maybe the fuse has always been blown).
2) possibly the temp regulation switch is not functioning properly, and
therefore the heater won't refire to maintain correct temp after shutting
down when high temp is reached.

The heater has backfired at times when I have tried to restart it.

the safety switch sometimes needs resetting, but not all the time.

Any input is appreciated.

Thanks, Brad
