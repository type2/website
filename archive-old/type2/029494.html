Stock they come with a 38 amp generator, but over the years they might get
converted to a 30 amp bug generator or to a late model alternator.

It's easy to tell the difference.  get behind the engine and look straight
at the top pulley.  Do you see vents on the housing around the pulley?  If
so, you have an alternator.  If the only vents are on the side of the
cylindrical housing, top and bottom, you have a generator.  To tell the
difference between the 30 and 38 amp generators, look at the numbers
stamped on the housing.

&gt; I know it's a stupid
&gt; question,

There are no stupid questions, only stupid mistakes.
