Subject: wheels

So I've wire wheeled, naval jellied, scrubbed all of the rust off of the front
of my wheels.  Should I bother with the back?  They are nowhere near the
rotten shape that the front sides were but do they need to be painted?  What
would you guys do?

By the way, thanks for all the info on tires that you all sent.  I ordered the
Vanco 8's from Continental.  (The mrs. got me a gift certificate to tires plus
for Christmas.)

And here's a tip: Soft Scrub with bleach makes old, dirty, rusty hubcaps shine
like new.
