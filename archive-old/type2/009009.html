                                Day Zero

1. Peregrine's rebuilt engine and what it has to do.

&quot;Peregrine&quot; is the name of my 1976 transporter, purchased last July to 
free me from the bondage of high motel rates, crummy service, and lousy 
furnishings while traveling to do research and to &quot;give papers&quot; at 
academic conferences. And that's what I am just about to do: drive from 
San Diego to Tucson (a little over 400 miles of mountains and desert), 
give a paper, meet with an editor, stay in campgrounds and RV resorts, 
and come home. In addition to being the name of a falcon, &quot;Peregrine&quot; 
means &quot;wanderer&quot; and so it ought to be a good name for a bus. But when I 
bought her, I did so in desperation -- for $400. And I discovered that it 
is possible to make a type2 run and even sound good when absolutely 
everything about the engine is bad. Peregrine was a turkey.

Over the course of the next three months I found that I had to 
replace the complete exhaust system and change the way she was aspirated 
-- from carbs back to FI. When I get help from the list I conclude 
that I have to rebuild the engine. But I have already spent over $2000 on 
such things as Yokohama 356 tires on all four corners, seat upholstery, 
the camper cabinets and hardware, and the fuel injection. I look in the 
archives to get a sense of what a proper rebuild will cost (and there, 
David Schwarze seems to be the authority) and decide that I cannot do 
proper. I am going to have to cut corners for now. What that ends up 
meaning is this: a clean case, heads, and tin (and a filthy kitchen in 
return); new camshaft and rod bearings, but keep the mains; a set of 
pistons and cylinders pulled from a burnt '79 at the junkyard; a head 
&gt;from the same bus (but with an exhaust manifold modified by hacksaw and 
grinder); new rings, gaskets, and old but lapped valves.

Theory: there are three sections to a proper rebuild: the heads, the P&amp; 
Cs, and the short block. When I have finished the make-do rebuild, I can 
decide the order for properly bringing the engine around and do it in stages.

Practice: By the end of this story, I will realize that the theory isn't 
right. A miscalculation in one area (say, heads) can seriously damage 
another (the block) unless you treat the engine oh so gingerly.

By Tuesday, April 13, all is ready. 

But I cannot get the engine to idle correctly. There are two idle speeds, 
far enough apart that neither is just right. At the fast speed, the bus 
is too loud by half. At the lower speed, it stumbles. I decide this is 
probably one of two things: either there is too much endplay still in the 
crankshaft, causing the distributor to &quot;hunt&quot; for idle; or there is too 
much play in the distributor pinion. Since the first is impossible to 
check or to do anything about, and the second can be checked easily, I 
check the latter. Pop the distributor cap off and wiggle the rotor back 
and forth. Golly, that's a lot of slop. I go inside and consult my 
lawfirm (Bentley, Muir, Haynes, and Wilson) who make clear  correctly, 2) 
I should pull the pinion and shim it correctly, and 3) that when I do so 
I stand a better than odds-on chance of dropping the washer into the 
case. And if I do that, I will need to pull the engine and crack the 
case. I decide to live with the dual idling speed for the time being. But 
that leaves a question unresolved. Should I time the bus for the high 
idle speed or the low one? 

Hang it, it's time to take Peregrine out on the road and start the 
breaking-in. I drive ten miles or so and decide to check the oil and have 
a taco. When it is time to go again, Peregrine won't restart. The starter 
turns slowly, and doesn't get much umph. That bugs me, because I 
installed a Bosch WR-1 relay in the starter circuit. But the only thing 
to do is to let the engine cool completely, so I get out my rechargeable 
drill and work on fastening down loose bits of camper. In due course, she 
restarts and I head home. I had hoped to get a hundred miles on the 
engine, but will have to settle for twenty.

Later in the day, I take my 16-year old son for a ride. He falls into 
gripester mode. He cannot get the seatbelts to work right. The bus is too 
loud. Why don't I come to a complete stop a stopsigns. This bus is never 
going to make it to Tucson. I tell him to shut up. I'm rattled. I think 
about cancelling the trip and the paper. I think about calling Avis and 
renting a car. I think and think, and worry and fret and then dig in my 
heals. I've spent thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours on this bus, 
and it is going to get me to Tucson. I drop to sleep in a haze of 
new-found resolve.

                          Day Two: Yuma or Bust

2. Final preparations and procrastinations

I never said that I was going to go to Tucson all in one day. The target 
for today is Yuma. Three hours of travel by Saab; I project four to five 
hours by bus. I give two lectures in the morning, turn over the third to 
my teaching assistant, and give a call to fellow listee Abraham Palmer, 
who graciously assented to my request for his starter, alternator, and 
fuel pump in a box (Abraham is in the midst of a proper rebuild -- he 
even had things like the crankshaft measured for wear!) Around noontime 
or so I meet Abraham at the medical school and walk off with the several 
vital organs from his bus. Next, a haphazard final packing and a stop by 
the AAA office to renew my membership. By 3:30 I am on the road.

Peregrine is running well, and I am keeping the speed down to 55. She 
pulls hills nicely and feels altogether like a very smart bus. But there 
is a long road ahead, and an obstacle that no one from back East can even 
imagine. To get out of San Diego and head anywh climb 5000 feet in less 
that thirty miles. There's no way around it. And then you much come back 
down in fewer that 15 miles. Zipping past the town of Alpine, I steel 
myself mentally for what's to come. 

And it comes. I shift down into third and maintain a speed of about 45 
mph. The bus sounds okay, but when I look out the rear mirror I see puffs 
of smoke coming from the rear of the bus. Damn. Damn damn damn. I stop 
and get out. As I peer into the engine hatch, a CHP car pulls in behind 
me. &quot;What's wrong?&quot; &quot;Oil leak.&quot; &quot;Yeah, well these things are prone to oil 
leaks. Do you want me to call for a tow?&quot; &quot;No, I think I am going to keep 
going and if she blows up, I will learn something.&quot; He leaves, I restart, 
and get underway. As I accelerate through second gear, I notice a buzzing 
sound that comes in at about 3500 rpms (by my best guess). I decide to 
use that sound as a restrictor, keeping the engine turning just below 
that. And it works. I pull the worst of the grade in second at around 25 
mph, and the smoke doesn't reappear. Before long I am over the three 
summits and headed back down into the desert.

3. One Hundred and Twenty Miles of Smooth Running

Now I am zipping along. The engine actually sounds smooth, and the desert 
air feels great after several weeks of cold and damp in San Diego. I stop 
in El Centro to top up the tank. This is necessary, because although I 
replaced the fuel guage sender in the gas tank, my fuel guage doesn't 
work. The needle only appears when the tank is full, and then only for a 
few seconds. As I fuel up, I note mileage and gasoline used. About 
eighteen miles to the gallon. I have some range -- surely two hundred 
miles to a tank of gas, conservatively. Back in the bus and off to Ynma.

Effortless, until I get into Yuma at sunset and turn on my lights. In a 
second or two, the alternator light comes on. This has happened before, 
but it was flakey. Eventually it will turn itself back off, I think. I 
pull off the interstate, have a sandwich at McDonald's, look through my 
campground guide, and choose a place to stay. In less than an hour I have 
camped for the night, and I look forward to a hot shower and the drive to 
Tucson in the morning.

What if the light doesn't go off? Well, in that case, I have Abraham's
alternator in the box, right over there on the floor. At worst, I will
have to swap alternators.  No big deal.
