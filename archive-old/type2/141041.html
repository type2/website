Subject: Re: [T2] wont idle cold

So what your saying is that the salt on the raods up north is whats causing
it not to idle?


It is HIS bus no one else let him do with it as he likes.

I only drive aircool dubs and guess what that mean I drive all year
round&lt;shocked&gt;

Ian (not in the great north but not in the deep south)

:&gt; Yes, I have an idea. Why are you driving a California bus in New York in
the
&gt; winter? I give it two years to scrap. The salt is going to eat it like it
&gt; eats ice, with zero resistance to corrosion like all the other million
buses
&gt; that rusted out.
&gt; Last summer I circled Lake Ontario in my bus. I saw two other aircooled VW
&gt; buses, both of them within 50 miles of home.  When I was in Syracuse area
&gt; gassing up, some people came up to me freaking out, that they hadn't seen
&gt; one of these buses for ages...they are rare and getting rarer and winter
&gt; driving a good bus is a big mistake.
