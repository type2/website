Howdy folks,
I am looking for a sun roof assembly for my &quot;new&quot; 73 Westy.  But first I have a couple of questions.  The 73 came with a pop-top (the kind that opens &quot;backwards&quot;) Isn't the opening the same size as the sunroof on these buses??  If so, I have a TON of parts from a 75 Westy to trade (it's pretty complete, w\cabinets, seats, sink, icebox, etc.) it has a dead engine (PO says burnt valve) and I have neither the time nor the bread to fix it.  So, If you have a sunroof assembly, it doesn't have to be perfect only complete, I will consider any parts trades from the 75 that you want to offer.  Hell, I'd probably even give you the whole bus for a decent and complete sun roof assembly!  Let me know! (BTW, I am located just north of Cincinnati, Ohio  and would consider either shipping items or driving up to 100 miles or so to meet someone half way.)


Peace, John Baker
