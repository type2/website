&gt; I am having big issues with this fuel injection thing, next step put on

carbs are VERY VERY hard to get working even reasonably well (no flames
please I know it has been done) on an engine designed for FI

&gt; on the throttle control unit (I think) the unit connected to the air filter 
&gt; box, then it will fire but will still not run! Does anyone have any ideas?  

that is the normal action

&gt; If the unit is bad I will be needing one.  so if any are for sale?
&gt; thanks again,

rare to need an Electronic module, but the Air Flow Meter does (on air
intake) occasionally lose a trace on the PC board inside, full info on
checking and fixing are in the library.

run through the FI troubleshooting chart also in the library, once you get
em running right they are pretty reliable and trouble free, problem is so
many people just putz with the FI that they are usually pretty out of
adjustment after 20 years or so.

unlike carbs on FI &quot;close&quot; isn't usually good enough
