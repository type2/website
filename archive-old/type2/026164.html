[...] While you're lubricating the assembly at the rear take a close look at
it.  There's a plastic guide piece that introduces slop in the system when
it gets worn and binds against the channel that it runs on.  I think the
part is available from WCM for about $10.

&gt; Having trouble with the sliding door on a '70 Westy.While sitting in a
&gt; garage
&gt; the door became stuck. I find I can open the door if I pull on the handle
&gt; as
&gt; hard as I can, which I am hesitant to do on a regular basis.When closing
&gt; the
&gt; door pulling up on the handle pulls in the rear of the door like it should
&gt; ,
&gt; just won't open easily. Any suggestions?
