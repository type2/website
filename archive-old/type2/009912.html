&gt; Throwing together an emergency engine for my friends 1970 bus we

&gt; we could not get the endplay within specs with three shims. We are
using
&gt; old parts from the stash under my workbench, bearings and gaskets
are new.
&gt; Have we done something wrong or is it OK to use four shims? All my
manuals
&gt; says three shims. Can't remeber the measurements we made but four of
the
&gt; thinner shims got it in specs. Not shure we got shims of all possible
&gt; thicknesses either. How thick are the thickest ones?

Shims range from 0.24mm to 0.36mm (.0095 to .0150 in).

Be careful in setting the end play on a worn engine, as the movement
might not the be the crankshaft in the bearing but rather the bearing
in the case.

If this is an &quot;emergency&quot; engine that will be itself be replaced soon,
it would be better to leave the endplay alone.  If you set it too
tight (very possible if the front bearing is a bit loose) you will
likely spin the bearing.
