.......snip................................
&quot;Anyone know of a high temp solution? I figure it's got to standup to
400F reliably. Since this is not structural panels I would like to try 
using the
adhesives for the first time.&quot;


How about...................Permatex. PermaPoxy 5 Minute Underwater Repair 
Epoxy Stick

You could even work with it outside, in the rain :~)

&quot;Ideal for underwater applications, this two part, hand kneadable, putty 
type epoxy has contrasting colored materials that are mixed together to 
form a uniform color to indicate thorough mixing. Eliminates the need for 
welding or brazing. Unaffected by chlorinated and salt water. Sets up 
underwater in five minutes. Off-White appearance. Fills gaps and will not 
shrink. When cured, can be drilled, sanded, threaded or filed. Waterproof. 
Temperature range -400F to 4000F (-400C to 2040C). Permanent strength up to 
3000 PSI.&quot;

400 F is at the top of the heat range, but it matches your number, 
so...........maybe this would work.             Doyt
