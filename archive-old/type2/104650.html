Subject: Re: Getting a rebuilt engine

Beth,
    I recently bought an engine from Bob Donalds of Boston Engine
Exchange.  He's got a great reputation for building a very good
engine.  He builds them one at a time as he gets an order and then
builds it the way you want it.  I haven't quite finished the
installation of my 1600 so I can't tell you how it drives.  I did
start it for a short run and it was as smooth as can be.
    I'd suggest you phone him up at 508-653-7229 and talk to him.
Tell him what kind of bus you have and how you drive and see what he
suggests.  On my first phone call to him he took the time to answer
all my questions.  Then when we went to pick up the engine, my wife
Kathy, and I got a tour of his shop and he took the time to explain
how and why he builds engines the way he does.  When we left I felt
like I had made a new friend.  He seems like a really nice guy.  And
if you buy an engine from him you get to call him with questions.
Also, if you can't or don't want to make the trip to pick up the
engine he can have it shipped
    Good luck with your new engine, where ever you get it from.  Just
make sure to have your bus running for the weekend of June 6.7+8 when
the Bus Alliance will have it's annual campout here on Long Island :-)
