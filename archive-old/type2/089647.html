Subject: Re: [T2] Horn wiring

Hi Steve,

The horn is negative switched i.e. the switch is on the earth side of the horn so running a direct feed from the battery to the horn will not spark as there is nowhere for the eath to go.

Use a jumper from the other side of the horn to earth to test the horn. 

If it still does not work (and fuse is good) then you have a fault in the wiring from the horn to button to earth, I'm sure there must be zillions of postings in the archives that will help you fix problems with the horn button.

Good luck

&gt; 
&gt; I am spending the day trying to get my horn rewired until this winter when I can redo my wiring.  I'm not getting any power from the existing wire (no spark) so I thought I'd just run a separate wire and did so, and still no spark.  Do I have a short or what.  The fuse box is just hanging and is not in a bracket, would this make a difference?  Should I do the Muir short test with the battery ground cable?  Any suggestions would be appreciated.
