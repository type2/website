Subject: Need Type 4 Pistons and Cylinders

Hello Fellow BusListers!

Kim and I NEED a set of good, used pistons and cylinders (reasonably priced) for her bright yellow 74 Campmobile. One of the local VW mechanics has a set, but it won't work for her engine because the pistons have a dish in them that won't fit over her connecting rods. Kim's bus has been down for about 3 weeks now, and she needs to get it running so she can visit her mom and her dog.

Any help from the list would be muchly appreciated...

David and Kim
74 Westy (Kim's)
67 Westy (David's)
