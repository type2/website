Subject: Re: [T2] Annoying FI Issue w/ cold engine

Your vac seems low initially-
My daughter's 75 had exact same symptoms- turned out to be a leak in a 
&quot;vac&quot; line going from the airbox (intake plenum)- carefully check the 
wide (3/8&quot;? takeoffs on the left side, especially the deep one with the 
90 degree bend in the connector; I had one fail there and used a hose 
clamp to seal it.  She also had (later) a leak in the large 2&quot; tubes 
that connect the airbox to the intake runners.  Until it was found, she 
put a hammer on the gas pedal and let it warm up.

&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; I've been quietly fighting this problem since before EveryBus. It's  not 
&gt; a huge problem, but it has been going on long enough now that it  is 
&gt; annoying the bejeebers out of me.
&gt; 
&gt; Problem: The bus won't idle when cold. It will idle poorly and stall  
&gt; repeatedly. Nurse it for a minute or two and it warms up and  thereafter
