Subject: Re: [T2] Re; Total VW dead

From all Dave Eccles has been saying on the JK forum (UK now) C+C is healthy 
and separate to the TotalVW probs.. there was some discussion regarding this 
some while back on http://www.justkampers.co_dot_uk

go to chat and then search.. might still be in archives although they have 
been trying to save space recently..

or go here... the C+C website of sorts.. has forum as well..
