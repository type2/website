Subject: Vacuum Hose Hookups
Message-ID: &lt;3762CB7D.1423789_at_net-link_dot_net&gt;

I am struggling with timing, overheating and poor idle with my new
engine.  I suspect that I have the vacuum systems hooked up wrong.  So
much for my notes.  I searched the archives for the answer but it seems
everyone else knows how this is all routed or has a different set of
accessories then I have.  1976 Westy with Fuel Injection.  Single vacuum
line to distributor.  Fuel pressure regulator.  Two seperate vacuum
systems, if I remember correctly.

I've set the distributor to 7.5 degrees BTDC at idle with the vacuum
attached, but it wants to idle better with more advance then this.  My
dwell angle is 48 degrees and steady.  On the other end of the spectrum,
above 2800 RPM the total advance is over 40 degrees BTDC and jumps
around alot. Perhaps this is causing the high temps?   I thought the two
advance systems in the distributor worked smoothly when I had the thing
in my hand, and I know there isn't a leak in the diaphram, so I don't
know why it's jumping.  Can somebody email me and point me in the right
direction please?
