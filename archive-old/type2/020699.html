Subject: re:archive (really long)

There have been other occurrences (notably on slashdot_dot_org)
of folks having material used without their permission for
commercial gain.
 
I honestly don't see any way out of the sticky thicket without
at least granting Type2_dot_com or whomever a non-exclusive right
to redistribute list posts. This doesn't remove the copyright
holders rights, but merely gives type2_dot_com the right to
distribute the posts. It's a change that is basically impossible
to enact at this point.

I realize this isn't new ground.

This may be- I'm not a lawyer at all, so I can get creative
with my interpretations of IP.

As a list subscriber, I've had almost every single one of these list
messages sent to me. That is, by implicit agreement, the various
subscribers have agreed to share with other subscribers. 
 
Using the archive is just another way to search information that you
are already licensed to use by virtue of being a list member.

To use Hoover as a bit of a dead horse- he asked to have certain
postings removed from the library. IF these postings had already
been sent to the list, then I, as a subscriber, should have a
right/license
to access them. (more technically if I had been subscribed at the time)
By sending them to the list, I feel that a license was granted to each
subscriber for their personal use.
 
If you extrapolate this back out to the more general case, as long as
the
archives were searchable only by list members, I don't see how  person
could
claim they didn't grant them license to be used. By virtue of the list
membership
being blind, it could be argued that this license extends to all
members, past,
present, and future, since their is no way to know who was subscribed at
what point
in time. A poster only knows that his posts are going to the list, not
who is on it,
and obviously accepts that fact since they continue to post.
 
So far my argument only makes the case that once material is posted, it
should be
available in perpetuity to all list subscribers.
 
If the list data is available in the raw form for download, or for the
cost of reproduction
on CD, to list members, it would still essentially fall into the
&quot;archive&quot; status.

If a separate program that was available to index all the information
and make it searchable
was available at extra cost, it's not a derivative product. All it would
do is take the freely
available list data, process it, and allow the licensee to view it in
another form.  This is
still fair use.
 
So, you essentially end up with two &quot;products&quot;. The first is the free
(for the cost of distribution)
raw list data. The second is a database front end that is capable of
processing the raw data. 

Sorry for the length. I just wanted to be clear (hopefully) with what I
was trying to say.
