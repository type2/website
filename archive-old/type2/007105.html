A funny thing happened when I drove away from the campsite (at Patoca
Res. in Southern Indiana) without disconnecting the water hose from the
side of my 78 Camper!  Dohhhhhh

The plastic tube broke right at the hose coupler.  Does anyone have a
spare fitting they would be willing to sell?  Vendors welcome also...
