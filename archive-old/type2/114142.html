Subject: Re: [T2] {FRIDAY} VW Cost Cutting was: LED Tail Lights

&gt;Let's see, there's the non-removable apron, the plastic door handles, the 
&gt;plastic non-reflective taillight assemblies.  What else do people have as 
&gt;their favorites?

General lack of soundproofing, suspension that is only rubber isolated at 
the pivot points but the torsion bars solid mount to the frame - noise! 
(how about a crossmember mounted in rubber like my HONDA here for the front 
and rear suspension?), heater with single (slow) speed fan assist, 4 
cylinder engine in vehicle priced like a Volvo (why not a 6?), no 5 speeds 
for more choice in the mountains, no ventilated front discs, only 1 
interior dome light, cables for heater and such that are tough (maybe I 
need to oil mine?).....

I probably need to drive a new one (anybody got a time machine I could 
borrow - I'll bring back parts for you...) and then I'd realize how 
different a 200K mile, 25 year old vehicle is from it's younger self...

Reading an interesting book right now: &quot;Battle for the Beetle&quot;. Bentley 
publishes it. The library where I work has it. Explains why VW's are what 
they are. I highly recommend this book for your reading list.
