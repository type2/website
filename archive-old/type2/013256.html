Steve is of course right as he assumes, all that MBZ nut is going to
be load bearing, hardly any of that Vanagon crimp nut is.

I want a set of those things now, that nut is &quot;money&quot; for us folks
pissed off at the crappy Vanagon nuts.  What are they off of Karl?
I haven't had as many issues as Steve has, but I'm tires of buying
$6 throw away nuts if I can hit a junkyard.
