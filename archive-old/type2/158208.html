Subject: Re: [T2] [ANOTHER QUESTION] Number of Gallons to Paint

In a message dated 4/13/06 9:22:21 AM, dcm_at_c-sw_dot_com writes:


&gt; Thank y'all for the feedback, but I forgot one *important* detail!  When we
&gt; talk &quot;number of gallons of paint&quot;, are we talking before or after mixing
&gt; reducer, etc.?  For example, the paint I'm considering using is mixed in a
&gt; ratio of 8:3:1 (paint:reducer:hardener).  If I can still do math, this
&gt; means that if I need one gallon of &quot;sprayable mixture&quot;, then I only need
&gt; 2/3 gallon (approximately 85.3 ounces) of paint (also need 1 quart of
&gt; reducer and approximately 10.7 ounces of hardener).
&gt;
Sheeesh...Enough with the math...How many cans of Krylon
are we talkin' about... ?-)
