Subject: gear oil can be red or black

from ggm
Automatic Transmission fluid is usually red in color

Ordinary regular old &quot;Gear Oil&quot; is usually, but not always,
dark brown black in color

Gear Oil always stinks like sulphur, and sometimes,
the leak at the engine to manual transmission junction leaks
gear oil that stinks like sulphur and burnt slippng clutch

The expensive super deluxe gear oil I use is
RED colored
I buy it in five gallon buckets at the local Farm supply store
The gear oil is used by farmers in their $250,000 combines and
tractors, and semi-tractors,
That red colored gear oil meets and exceeds all VW specifications
 It is GL-6, and EP
(I don't know what the GL-6 means, but the EP
stands for Extreme Pressure lubricating abilities)
Even though that Gear Oil is Red, it still stinks like sulphur.

If I did find unknown or untrusted source red colored fluid in
my manual transmission, I would change it right away just
to be sure, even if it did stink like sulphur, the stink could be
from mixing with the remaining true gear oil.

Automatic Transmission fluid will ruin a manual transmission.

You can get a really neat cheap pump for the 5 gallon bucket
of gear oil at the farm supply store.  The idiot book tells you
to use a big metal syringe to squirt in the gear oil, aieee
That is too hard to use when it gets cold outside the pump
has a long hose and a really nice handle that you can
work with your foot while you lie under the bus.
