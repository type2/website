&lt;&lt; For example, the actual retail price on the sliding door handles that we've
just released is $23.00.  But we've been shipping them for $23.00
_including_ the shipping to make it a bit more competitive with other
vendors who sell them for $20.00.  In this case, I lose at least $4.50 to
shipping on this sale.

Think BD or other VW vendors are bad...?-(
I mailed an oddball piece of Britannia (sidescreen frame for a Morgan)
to another owner so he could use it as a template since he had nothing
to work from. UPS charged me about 10/11 bucks...
The guy I shipped it to wanted to show his appreciation, so he ordered
a Morgan coffee mug for me from England ($11 USD)...Six weeks later
I got the mug...But It was an MG-TC mug. I e-mailed the co. in England
and they said, &quot;No problem, mate, just send the wrong one back and
we'll send you the right one!&quot;
&quot;Freight collect?&quot; says I...
&quot;Oh, no,&quot; says they, &quot;We don't accept that sort of thing.&quot;
So I shipped the mug back ($16) and another six weeks later I got
the righto one...
So much for a free cuppa tea... ;-(
