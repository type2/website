Subject: NAPA Shocks?

NAPA has a listing for shocks at $12.49 a piece for my 73. Ok, that's
rediculously cheap considering there's a NAPA around the corner from
my house... No shipping. Yay!

But... Are these even worth bothering with? I don't mind using cheap
shocks and changing them every year, but if they're worthless even
when new, it's obviously not worth the trouble...

Anybody used them? Like 'em? Hate 'em?
