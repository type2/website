&lt;&lt; m pissed.  I just added oil to my 79 Loaf about a month ago.  I hardly
 ever drive it because I attend college that won't allow a freshman to have a
 car on campus.  I'm back home for spring break and I just started the bus up
 and heard this terrible knocking noise! Now, I know there's oil in there, cuz
 ain't no oil leak gonna do that! What's the deal?? &gt;&gt;

ahhhh ..... the beauty of hydra. lifters.   for the simple and easiest check,
take off the main coil wire, so that when you crank it over it wont start.
what you will accomplish is that the oil pressure will come up because of you
cranking the motor,  i believe the lifters might have bled off.  even if my
solution does not fix it ... i still recommend doing the simple tests first.
have fun...........
