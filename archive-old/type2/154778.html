Subject: Re: [T2] 2000CC Longblock

I recently took delivery from Boston Bob but have yet to assemble the beast.
I found him very easy to work with however -- and the motor looks gorgeous
sitting in the crate.  (I imagine they all do...)

Given the large amount of information out there regarding GEX and their
inability to produce a quality product it's very easy to just assume you
got a lemon. However, since a longblock is a major investment are you
sure this is the problem. All that aside I have heard good things about
Boston Bob should you require a new engine.
