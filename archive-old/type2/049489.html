Subject: Re: [T2] drain plug

&gt; 3.)Unrelated.  How in the _at_#$# do i get the stripped to a coneshape oil
&gt; drain plug out?.... Visegrips just slip off and take a little metal with
&gt; them.  I have a replacement, but can't get the bugger off.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Use a die grinder and cut a slot in it, then use a BIG screw driver or
&gt; impact screwdriver. Or grind two flats on it and use Vise Grips. Use a
&gt; chisel and beat it counter clockwise to remove or loosen it. Arc/Mig weld
a
&gt; larger nut to it and then put a wrench on that to remove. Drill a small
hole
&gt; in the end just till you break through the nut, then heat it with propane
to
&gt; hot, not red, then apply parafin wax and allow to cool. Then use one of
the
&gt; above methods to grip it. Your tools will determin the best one of these
for
&gt; you.
&gt; Most of all, be very carefull and do not strike this nut with a hammer,
you
&gt; do not want to damage the stud. You must split the case to remove this
stud.

I am a little confused by the last 2 sentences. He asked about the drain
plug on a 2.0L. A 2.0 drain plug is a 14mm plug that screws into the left
half of the crankcase. Were you referring to the screen/plate in the right
half of the case that is held on by one small bolt?
