Subject: Re: [T2] George Lyle--He de man.

&quot;George Lyle&quot; &lt;glyle_at_pon.type2_dot_com&gt; said:
&gt;&gt;many distributors retard the #3 spark to keep that cylinder cool. The 
&gt;&gt;spark is probably arriving too late for #3 to contribute to idle power, 
&gt;&gt;although it is probably firing.  When the distributor advances, #3 will 
&gt;&gt;take up its share of the load. &lt;&lt;

If this is true, then if the distributor drive is 180 degrees off, as 
someone posted earlier today, will it then be retarding #1 instead?  This 
would seem like a good reason to rotate the drive rather than move the plug 
wires.  My camper's previous owner installed the drive backward so the first 
thing I ever did to an acvw was pop out the drive.  If a total newbie like 
me with brand new metric tools can do it, any one can.  =)

On another note, can a vacuum advance distributor even work 180 degress out 
or will the canister hit?  I wonder if this is why the p.o threw away my 
camper's original vacuum advance distributor and bought the 009.
