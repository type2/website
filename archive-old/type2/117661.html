Subject: Re: [T2] Rear Window Defogger Grid

Russ,

With my 78, the problem *was* multiple breaks in the grid lines.

They &quot;looked&quot; pretty good until you actually started probing them
with a VOM or looked at them through a magnifing glass.  Multiple
little valleys with no connection.

That is why i ended up doing all of them.

I gently cleaned off all of the oxidation with fine steel wool and then
used masking tape to match(as closely as possible) the lines along the 
original.  Easy to then run a paint line down the middle and wait the
20 minutes or so for it to dry.

The only thing i should have done differently is to use the *really* good
paint type masking tape.  Easy to do while sitting on the porch with your 
favorite beverage and good conversation(with the window out of 
course)&lt;grin&gt;.

Cheers, dave

&gt; I've been trying to solve this problem for years. I get proper voltage at
&gt; the terminals and busbars at the ends of the window when the switch is on,
&gt; but no current flows (checked w/ ammeter in series w/ grid).  I measure an
&gt; open circuit from busbar to busbar with the power off.  I probed the
&gt; gridlines with a voltmeter to try to find the breaks (meter leads on each
&gt; side of a break would show nearly full voltage - meter leads across good
&gt; grid line would show minimal voltage), but, I must have multiple breaks in
&gt; every gridline.
&gt; 
&gt; Took 2 $20.000 kits.
