Subject: RE: [T2] NEW Front Axle Beams!

&gt; And for the uninitiated... they will also fit 1970 buses.  
&gt; Modifications necessary may include brake line changes (if 
&gt; you upgrade to the vacuum boosted braking system)/steering 
&gt; box bracket relocation(unless you plan to upgrade from the 
&gt; peg-and-roller steering  to the later version).  I believe the '68
&gt; transporter has a different location for its beam mounting holes.  
&gt; Is '69 the same as '70?  I bought one of Ron's beams from the last 
&gt; round of sales, and I'm looking forward to a tight, new 
&gt; suspension/brakes/steering again!


According to the archives, '68 and '69 are the same (and have different
mounting bracket spacing from '70 up). I couldn't confirm this from
personal experience, though.
