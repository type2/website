Subject: windshield removal

Hi All,

Say, I'm having a new windshield installed. I'd like to fix a couple of rust
goobers in the sill first, so I'd like to pull the windshield. I would guess
I grab the rubber seal at the seam and give a yank. But, like I said I'd be
guessing.

Can someone tell me how to pull the windshield, safely, without turning it
into 1000 pieces?

Thanks in advance,

Pete
