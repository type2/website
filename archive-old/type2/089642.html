Well another way to think about it is that the biggest in windows air
conditioner at costco is 12,000 BTUs, with is 15 Amps at 110 Volts.  You are
talking about a very big air conditioner for the bus.  Maybe you want to
tint the windows?

but your server room isn't subjected to direct sunlight &amp; heat gain
through windows. That makes a huge difference. Plus is that 7500 btus
in addition to the conditioned spaces around it?
