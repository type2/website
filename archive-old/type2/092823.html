Subject: Re: [T2] Steering Woes

If the tie rods are what we are talking about - it is normal for them to 
rock back and forth a little at the ends. If they are twisting at the 
threads then somebody did not tighten them up after an adjustment.

At the ends - the tie rod ends - they are supposed to swivel or rock a bit 
- to allow for the movement of the suspension.

It's hard to explain and I always try to explain my answers like you've 
never seen the underside of a VW bus.

Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

Let us know.




&gt;I have an appointment, thanks!  They dont move at the threads, they move at
&gt;the couplings?

&gt; &gt; Take it to a specialist.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It is difficult to diagnose such an important safety item through e-mail.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In short - these round bars are threaded on both ends and this is the
&gt; &gt; adjustment for the steering alignment. Once adjusted they are locked in
&gt; &gt; position by a locked nut.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; They may rock a slight bit as both ends are swivel joints (basically) to
&gt; &gt; use a non-technical term.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; They should not rotate alot though.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; A worn front end will have joints that have alot of slop in them.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'd say it is time to bring in a friend that can inspect the van or take
&gt;it
&gt; &gt; to a specialist.

&gt; &gt; &gt;Under the front of my bus, the long round bars that connect the wheels to
&gt; &gt; &gt;the steering box, one on either side.  The R has an adjustment, the L
&gt;does
&gt; &gt; &gt;not.  Should this spin if I grab them and twist them, or is that
&gt; &gt; &gt;bad.  (please excuse my blind ignorance on what everything is
&gt; &gt; &gt;called.)  Could this by the source of my loose steering??
