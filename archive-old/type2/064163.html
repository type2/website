Hi folks... have been dismantling the pancake engine I purchased with 
the 72 westy.  Finally got the tin off this am and the meant removing 
the carbs.

WQhen I did, I notioced an awful lot of crud in the thingy where the 
carbs attached to the motor.  The ports on the motor were orange with 
rust too.  I expected shiy clean!   I have no idea when this engine last 
ran.

The cylinder heads are not covered in oil but they look damp.  

Oh well... I'll forge ahead.  

Should those &quot;ports&quot; have been cleaner?   The plugs came out although 
one needed a small sledge to convince it but the threads are just fine.

I need a little... there there, it'll be okay stuff.

Barry...
