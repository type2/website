&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; I own a 1976 VW westy and I need to haul a trailer behind it. I need
&gt; to haul 
&gt; a bike &amp; single axle trailor which weighs approx 300 lbs total. Has
&gt; anyone 
&gt; ever done this? Is it possible to buy a bolt on hitch anywhere? Or do
&gt; I have 
&gt; to build my own and what should I bolt it onto?

There are factory made trailer hitches for buses, but I'm not aware of
them still being manufactured.

The vertical loads are taken by the rear bumper, while the hitch
extends foreward to the torsion housing to transmit the horizontal
loads.  The hitches usually have two members made of 1/2 by 1 inch
solid steel that extend forward from a conventional tongue, bend a few
times to conform to the engine, and then attach to the bottom of the
torsion housing with U-bolts.  The tongue attaches to the bumper with a
clamp arrangement.

I don't recommend the hitches that bolt only to the bumper, as they put
a lot of twisting stress on the bumper that it simply wasn't designed
to take.  German engineering practice was to design in just enough
strength to do the job, without a huge overload margin.  That's why a
3000 pound bus can carry a ton while a C*evy has to weight twice as
much to have the same load-carrying capacity.

Remember that the weight of the trailer and its load has to be deducted
from the weight you carry inside the bus.
