Subject: engine dies when I brake to a stop, fuel filter keeps running
  dry

Hello List,

The problem that i am having is with my 73 beetle, not
my bus but seeing as my question involves the commonly
used 34 pict 3 carb on a stock 1600cc DP engine, I
thought I would ask the list. When I brake to a stop,
the engine almost always dies. I usually have to keep
tapping the accelerator pedal to keep the engine from
dying. Also,I had to set the idle really high (almost
2000rpm) to keep it from stalling at idle. Even with
the high idle, it still dies occasionally when it is
idling. The fuel filter seems to run dry when it dies.
When I am driving it, the engine runs fine with little
to no hesitation on acceleration, and it has plenty of
power. It seems almost like the carb does not have
enough 'suction' on the fuel line when I am trying to
stop the moving vehicle or when it is idling. Has
anyone had this problem before? Does it sound more
like a carb adjustment problem or some kind of partial
occlusion in the fuel line? By the way, I just rebuilt
the carb with new gaskets and I cleaned every part and
orifice.

Thanks in advance for any help you might have!

Cheers!
David Kelly
