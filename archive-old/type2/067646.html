On my H2O VWS I had to hacksaw off the head and 
had to remove the rest of the bolt with Vice Grips. This
worked due to the tension relieved from the removed head.
Also on a stubborn few I used the Vice Grips with as much
grip humanly possible and the allen socket both turned
simultaneously. Good luck.
