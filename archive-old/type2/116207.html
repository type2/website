Subject: Looking for '77 driver side door:)

Hi

I am looking for a driver side door for my 1977 westy. I would love it
if someone who has one would be willing to bring it to the bug out in
Manassas VA this weekend (May 25). Or heck I will come to your place
anywhere in the MD/DC/VA area:-) I am looking for a nice door with no
previous body work done to it.

I have a nice one that I thought was a 77 door but the hinges were
different? Would this be a 78 door? Did they change it after 77? Well
any help would be grately appreciated.

Peace

Meg
