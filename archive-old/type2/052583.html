Subject: [T2] Type IV inventory sell-off...SOLD SOLD!!!

Hey folks,
The complete inventory I had posted of type IV parts, 72 westy and 411
motors and parts, has been sold to a fellow list member.  I am still getting
mail and calls from you all, so I know it was a great deal...but it is sold.
Happy trails...

thanks
zac
