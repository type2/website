  I'm asking if there are sensors for this purpose that might be adapted.

The nacelle is fitted with heat sensors connected to warning lights in the
cockpit.

And yes, you can do the same thing.  In fact, it's a lot easier to do with a
car because you don't need to use certified aircraft materials.  

Here's one trick that works:

   Buy some new-surplus coffee-pot thermostats from Ass Company, otherwise
known as American Scientific Surplus.  

Screw a couple of them on the overhead of the engine bay.  Wire them to 12v
thru a suitable fuse and wire their outlet to an audible alarm in the
cockpit.  

The ones I used to control my oil-cooler fan turn on at about 170 degrees F.
 Cost was about a buck per switch.   One-seventy might be a tad low for a
fire-warning circuit but since the only thing it's going to set-off is you...

As to opening the hatch to put out a fire, bad idea.  A better bet would be
to make your fire extinguishing system semi-permanent, with the bottle in the
cargo bay but the nozzle(s) in the engine compartment.  Fire horn blows?
 Grab the D-ring and pull.

Of course, the best kind of fire safety is prevention.  Fires don't happen
unless we allow them to.
