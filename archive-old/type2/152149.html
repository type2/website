&gt;  old worn out motor, and my brand new one with new lifters,  if I leave

&gt;  makes them work a lot better, is to run a 1/4 to 1/2  a bottle of the GM
&gt;  engine oil supplement. For a bad case of loud lifters, or a motor that's
&gt;  been sitting forever use a full bottle.  Just my opinion.....

lot easier just to drive it most every day. more fun too
