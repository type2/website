Subject: Solo Windshield Installation
Message-Id: &lt;3.0.3.32.19990328192309.007b63f0_at_pop.conknet_dot_com&gt;

	I installed a new windshield in my '71 bus today.  Only took 3 attempts
and I did it solo.  First attempt went well until the last corner which
wouldn't go in.  I figured I didn't have it completely centered so I took
it out to try again.  Second try everything lined up well but I think I
sprayed too much silicone spray because the windshield fell out - but I
broke the fall by grabbing an end on its descent to the barn floor.

	Of course the seal came off so that took a little bit to get back on
again.  For the 3rd attempt I made sure to check that both sides were the
same distance from the frame.  I also propped up a 10 foot 2 X 6 with a
towel against the windshield to apply just a little safety pressure in case
it wanted to pop back out.  I then pulled the string a foot or so and then
went outside and pushed - then back in and pulled in the opposite
direction.  I did this rotation maybe 6 times -  and the glass went in
perfectly.  The seal slipped over the lip like a zipper as I went around
the frame from the inside.

	I used 1/8 inch woven nylon rope and silicone spray.
