&gt; &quot;The only other major new items that I replaced were all the mechanical
&gt; lifters with hydraulic lifters - to include new pushrods.  I ended up
&gt; making my own pushrods and did my best to get them all the same length
&gt; per the hydraulic length spec.&quot;

this may cause some of your problems, the solid/hyd pushrods are made of
different material and may expand at a different rate,  swap in &quot;REAL&quot; hyd
pushrods

&gt; This could be a problem Chris. Are you trying to run hydraulic lifters on a
&gt; solid lifter cam? I am no expert on this but I think you need to change
&gt; more than just the lifters and pushrods to go to hydraulic... What did you
&gt; make you pushrods out of? Why not use stock equipment?

my understanding is that yes there is a difference and it has to do with
the ramp up on the different cams, but I also understand that brand new
lifters will not damage a cam only used ones will because they have
already been &quot;Shaped&quot; and work hardened from use.

&gt; &quot;Once the lifters were pumped up I adjusted the valves to 1.5 turns in
&gt; from 0 clearance and this seemed to prevent it from starting.  When I
&gt; adjust the valves at .006 in the engines starts and will run as long as
&gt; my foot is on the gas. Once the engine is hot it will not start right
&gt; away until I let it cool down.&quot;

get correct hyd pushrods and try again, I am a strong believer in hyd
lifters so if you really want em I would try to get em to work.
