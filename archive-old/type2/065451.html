I don't even trust jack stands.  Then again I have a gravel driveway 
as a work space, and getting those things properly seated in the 
gravel is almost impossible.  I leave the floor jack in position, use jack 
stands and add some hefty wood pieces under there also.  Thinking 
about building a wooden elevated ramp to raise the entire vehicle 
about 8&quot;.  (two 2x6's vertical under a 2x8, full length of vehicle)
