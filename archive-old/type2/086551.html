Subject: 009 article

Here is the article on the 009.  I have tried this, and believe me, it do=
es work, and works well. This article describes what you can do about 009=
 hesitation.   This is the cure!  I know of an engine that has been runni=
ng for 5 years with an 009 in this application.  We have had the chance t=
o try other dizzies on there, but they did not perform much better.  The =
difference was very minimal.  Many will say this is not so, but how many =
of those have tried what this article suggests?  The man is not God, I ag=
ree, but does run a very well respected business, with about 30 years und=
er his belt.  I only agree with this article because it has been tried, a=
nd it is true.  To me it is really a matter of what you want.  But if you=
 do have a 009, here is what you need to do to make it run properly. http=
://www.bostonengine_dot_com/articles/009.html  Although I do agree that it ma=
y be easier to get another dizzie and just drop and go!  Using an 009 doe=
s require some extra effort to run properly.  Is it apples, and apples? o=
r is it apples, and oranges? hard to say from what I have seen.         B=
