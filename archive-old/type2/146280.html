Subject: PDP installations

Fact # 1: My '76, Peregrine, had a PDP under-dash AC installed when I 
bought her. I stripped it out long ago.

Fact # 2: There is 1&quot; styrofoam inside the nose of the bus that I'm 
taking out now to do the body work there.

Are these facts related? Did PDP include styrofoam insulation as part 
of the installation package?
