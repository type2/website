Subject: Re: [T2] Bizarre dwell?

&gt; Bad: While test driving last night a hubcap flew
&gt; off. It made it all the way
&gt; here from CO without any problems. Why would it fly
&gt; off now? I had better
&gt; check the phase of the moon...
&gt; 
Shouldn't be the moon - New last Monday and now at
apogee, so least influence! Must just be bad CARma!

Be sure to remove all non-essential wiring from coil.
I mention the tach )if you have one) cuz they are
notorious for this.

Strange how stuff goes haywire furthest away from
home. Had a tranny stuck in two gears at the point of
my vacation furthest from home a couple years ago -
didn't know the trick of removing the back-up light
switch at the time, either... just lucked out to get
home. -BaH
