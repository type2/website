Subject: Popping out of 4th gear at times? 

This weekend on a trip to the hill country here in Texas, when shifting to 4th
gear at the start of a mild climb, it will pop out of 4th under the load after
about 5 to seconds from shifting.

On a 500 mile this weekend it did like 5 times.

71 Westy, Stock 1600 DP, Stock transmission, 125k miles on transmission.

My question:

Is this symptom typical of a transmission problem or possible linkage?

Thanks,
Trey
Houston
