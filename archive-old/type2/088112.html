     Wanted to let everyone know.  The insurance company made us a offer =
&amp; we accepted it.  They offered us $4650 for the bus &amp; $2100 for the =
contents.  Hopefully in a few days we can start looking for a new bus.  =
I want to thank al for the support &amp; encouragement during this very =
stressful time.
