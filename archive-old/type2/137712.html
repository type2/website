Subject: Re: [T2] Mallory

I think the difficulty here is that it takes a dyno to accurately
chart the optimal advance curve for each motor, and then an advance
curve chart for each distributor to optimally match the two. Since
most of us don't have the facilities to do this, we can only rely on
the reports of people with research facilities like Jake Raby.
Hopefully someday this information will be compiled into chart form
for public research.

 there is no comparison...
 
 The power increase was related to the DISTRIBUTOR. ... The power
increase Jake Raby has seen time and time again.... I am also
confused. I do not understand how I can be coming across as &quot;unclear&quot;
....
