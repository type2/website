&gt; exactly like the CQ on their site.  Unless there is load range difference.

According to the Nokian North America site, CS is an &quot;All-Purpose&quot;
tire, as opposed to winter or summer tire:

The tread pattern does look exactly the same.  The description for it
claims &quot;outstanding snow and ice grip&quot;.   Maybe the rubber compound is
softer for the CQ.
