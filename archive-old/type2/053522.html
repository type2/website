Subject: Re: Flywheel end play

&gt; RMMW sells an &quot;end play tool&quot; for $28.50. I'm wondering if this tool works
&gt; adequately? I also saw it in J.C. Whitney- but I can't locate it in the
&gt; catalog I'm looking at now. I thought it was much cheaper. Has any one used
&gt; this tool? Or would it be cheaper to get a dial gauge?


A dial gauge can be gotten much cheaper than this. See www_dot_use-enco_dot_com.
Get a catalog. They often have sales on sets of dial gauge, mic, caliper
for 25.00 or less. There are dial gauges in the catalog from 11.99 to
189.00.
