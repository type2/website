&gt; Lacking that has anyone any experience with speedo repair shops? Palo Alto
&gt; speedometer is the only name I've heard. Has anyone used them?

Al, all,

Nope, but for those who want to experiment, the contact info is:

Palo Alto Speedometer
718 Emerson St.
Palo Alto, CA 94301-2410
Tel: 650-323-0243
Fax: 650-323-4632
Web site: http://www.paspeedo_dot_com/

If anyone has other shops that do this sort of work, feel free to post
contact info.  I have the &quot;classic problem&quot; with my Vanagon (broken
odometer drive gear) and would love to find a bulk source for the brass
BMW gears!  I have 3 speedos and all are busted in the same way :-(
