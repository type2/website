&gt; FWIW they went $165 each, which seems to me somebody got a
&gt; heck of a deal compared to cheesy rebuilds, easily $500 from most
&gt; vendors.  Also a good price comparison point on what AMC heads
&gt; are worth.

In some of those magazines I see a company offering rebuilts for
$95......they have to be culls totally rewelded for that price....
$165 each was a very good price for new heads. I have just about reached the
point of giving up looking for used heads with no cracks....it gets old
pulling them off complete engines and maybe finding one good head out of 3
or 4 engines....
I did find a pair of 914 2.0 heads yesterday that so far appear good. I say
'so far' because a lot of the time the cracks are hidden by carbon and they
don't show up until I soak them in cold parts cleaner and dissolve the
carbon. My friend Harry has a 63 doublecab and we are building a 2.0 for
it....those 914 heads and the 914 pistons and cylinders should work just
fine:)
