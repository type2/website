&gt; I've got an extension on mine.  Helps on the throw as I'm a stubby
&gt; lass.  ;-)
&gt; A more ergonomic handle coupled with a nice extension would be cool!
&gt; Pics!

If you don't mind my asking, what's your current extension made from, what's
it's length, and how is it attached to the shift shaft?  I can look at
trying an extension, but I have to be careful about making sure that it's
sturdy and safe.

I sculpted the &quot;ErgoKnob&quot; (TM?) by mounting and then squeezing a large
dollop of (VERY) quick set RTV silicone into place on the shaft with my
right hand.  A few minutes later, I had a rough model of a knob custom
fitted to the human hand (well, my hand, anyway).

24 hours (longer setting RTV) and a few minutes later, and I had two
prototypes cast in resin (plastic).  One to mount in Giacomo to test it's
design in actual use, and the other to clean up into a master for production
casting.

I may need to do another one with my son being the model for the knob's
size.  The original might be a tad large for smaller hands.

BTW, being a &quot;stubby lass&quot; is cool.  My wife (passed in `92, www.melas_dot_org)
was 5' 2&quot; &quot;with eyes of blue&quot;.  Just the right size. :O)
