Subject: Fuel Filter Saga: Temporary Conclusion

Hello All --
I just wanted to write and first say a BIG thanks to all of you kind souls
who took the time to send your ideas, fixes and suggestions for my recent
problems that began with an assumed fuel filter problem. (If I forgot
anyone in my list of e-mail addresses, please forgive me; I went back and
found all that I could.) I really appreciate all the input; I tried many of
the troubleshooting tips that came my way - and there were some great ones
- but alas with no luck. However, they all helped me to learn more about my
bus. As it turns out, I decided to employ a little &quot;professional&quot; help and
here's the verdict: clog in the fuel tank. (Mike C., you NAILED it.)
Apparently I've got some naughty bits floating around in there - most
likely fuel filler neck pieces - one of which settled onto one of the
outbound holes. They blew it out and the way is now clear, but it's only a
matter of time when another piece settles back onto the hole and the
problem resurfaces. For now, I'm gonna bask in the delight of having the
bus driveable again -- eventually and soon, however, I'm gonna have to
figure out what my next move is (i.e. try to fish the piece[s] out, do some
hose fitting work [excellent idea, Surfer Bob!], remove the tank [hopefully
not], etc.) and take steps from there. When I do, I will be referring back
to your valuable suggestions (and the archives and even maybe the List, of
course) for guidance.  Thanks again for offering your help.
