Subject: Re: [T2] Windshield Wiper Questions

Trey,

Time to get serious.

After 30+ years, pull everything, grease everything, clean all 
connections, including the fuse holder for the wipers.

Volkswagen  windshield wipers to not work on vacuum, but plain old battery 
power.

Do be carefull on reinstall...put the wipers on last!..after you have 
tested everything else and are sure that they park correctly.

Oh, and watch out for fingers...windshield wipers motors are geared very 
strong and will eat fingers....don't ask how I know&lt;grin&gt;.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Pardon me as I have looked for an answer here in the archives: no luck...
&gt; 
&gt; The wipers on my 71 Westy at times barely move across the windshied and then
&gt; at other times seem to move fine. You would think there was a vacum issue here
&gt; or something.
&gt; 
&gt; They do work but so slow it's painful when raining . I've applied 3 gallons of
&gt; RainX  to help here but it's driving me crazy.
&gt; 
&gt; And when its moving slow I can turn the knob to the fast position and it
&gt; doesn't get any faster....
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
