Subject: RE: [T2] Mexico VWs?

I asked this question last year and was told it was nearly impossible...yet
it can be done with a btlmex...I think it was basically an issue of cost.

I think 2001 was the last year of the Bay Window in Mexico.

Hey guys,

1) What was the last year they produced the &quot;Bay Window&quot; Bus in Mexico?

2) Is it legal to buy a fairly new Bay window Bus from Mexico, swap the vin
tags and frame pieces and call it an American 1973 Bus?
