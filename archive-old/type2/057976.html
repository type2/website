Subject: FS: '82 Vanagon $600
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I originally bought this van sight-unseen for parts, but upon looking at it
when it arrived, I feel that it would be a shame to part it out.  It's got
250k miles, but looks quite good.  It has a rare 1/3-2/3 front bench seat,
with a fairly nice homemade table setup in the in front of the rear seat.
The body is basically straight and solid, and the paint looks good. The only
thing wrong with it (that I know of) is that it's supposedly running on 3
cylinders. It lost power when the owner was driving it locally about two
weeks ago, and he limped home.  He went to start it a week later and it
wouldn't turn over.  He had been thinking of selling it anyway, and didn't
want to pay for a tow and repairs on an old van, so he sold it to me. I
haven't tried to start it.  It could need a spark plug wire, a head, or a
whole engine; I don't know and don't have time to look.  He did tell me that
the engine was rebuilt about 75k miles ago, and that it drove just fine
until two weeks ago.  Tires, etc. look good. It has a current inspection but
it runs out Nov. 1. I may be wrong about it being an '82, perhaps it's an
'83; I don't have the title in front of me.

If anyone would like to save this bus, I'd gladly sell it for $600 as-is in
order to keep it on the road, which is  certainly less than the value of the
parts.  Please let me know soon, though, so I can decide what to do.  If
there is no interest I suppose I'll end up parting it out.  I'm in the
Philadelphia/Allentown Pa. area.
