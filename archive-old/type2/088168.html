A month or so ago I drove 70+ mph for 10,500 miles in three weeks.  This =
trip took me over 5 passes greater than 10,000 feet and through northern =
Arizona (HWY 666 is apocalyptic!) in mid June.  Drive your bus!  It's =
good for it and even better for you!  If I had a nickel for every =
Taurus, Lumina or other soul-less vehicle I saw BDOTSOTR, I would have =
been able to drive longer!  Here's to post graduation road trips. =20

I was also thinking that probably more miles have been put on aircooled =
VW Buses than any other van/truck ever.  1950-something till '83.  =
That's a lot of roadtrips and there are still tons of buses with 250,000 =
miles on them.
