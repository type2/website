Subject: Re: [T2] troubleshooting engine leak

What Mark was referring to is the oil pressure idiot
light sending unit which is directly forward of the
distributor. If you look down from above, you can see
it. It has a wire attached to it and a black neoprene
&quot;skirt&quot; around it to prevent cooling air from excaping
through the hole in the tin. Pull that skirt out of
there (carefully) and then watch this sucker while the
engine runs. It's a very likely candidate. -BaH

 Hi, 
 Excuse me for not being more direct about my fault.
  I live in Canada on PEI and the Lavie brothers are a
 main source for
 repairs.
  However, this list exceeds any advice I can get from
 other sources, you
 people are the greatest!
  My Bus is a 1978 CDN Campmobile.  
 160000 on the original type 4 engine. 
 I had to replace the crank seal behind the fan. I am
 able to see it and it
 looks good.
  If someone is mentioning something about an oil
 sensor seal, I am wondering
 if you could refer me to the green Bentley manual,
 page and section.
  I cleaned everything up and ran the engine, before
 air flaps could open and
 about 5 minutes in, the oil started to flow from
 above the oil filter and
 fast! Some fast.
  So, that confirms the leak.
  Could it be on the oil cooler? It looks tricky to
 get out.
 If it is the seal for the oil temp indicator, that
 makes a lot of sense to
 me.
  Since my bus has recently been painted, I am
 discovering stuff jammed up,
 like the temp flaps which created an over heat
 condition earlier this
 summer.
  Thanks guys.
 Alan
