Subject: Re: [T2] Heater Box/Accordian Tube cuffs

Jules -

Actually, the &quot;cuffs&quot; for the heater tubes on the 68-79 Bay Window are 111
819 945.  The &quot;251&quot; are way too large (NLA anyway as previously noted).  You
can get them from Airhead Parts:

http://www.airheadparts_dot_com/viewDetail.asp?strMasterCat=&amp;idproduct=5659

Ignore the $17 price shown on the page - they're actually $7.95 each (Gotta
fix that tonight).  Got 11 in stock.  800-550-5036 &amp; talk to Jason.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; Trying to patch up the heat system before winter (probably common
&gt; right about now) and I'm looking for part # 251-255-393D &quot;silicone
&gt; cuffs from an aircooled Vanagon&quot; as detailed by ratwell's excellent
&gt; heat writeup http://www.ratwell_dot_com/technical/Heating.html.
&gt; Anyone know where to find these things?
&gt; Oh yeah, Richard's writeup was for 72-79 heat and I'm running at type
&gt; 1 1600 in a '71, but these cuffs will probably work on my setup,
&gt; right? Need something to fill the gap between the heater boxes and
&gt; accordian tubes. Currently I've got nothing.
&gt; Thanks
&gt; peace
