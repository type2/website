BUT, this still doesn't explain why your date code says April 6 when the
VIN is from early May.  I wouldn't rule out an error on the plate, after all,
somebody in the factory had to set up each bus's VIN plate individually,
maybe they just goofed.  Is there any chance that layers of paint or a bad
stamping made the digits unclear?  Here's a scenario:  the plate-stamping
machine probably had little wheels with raised numbers on the outside.  On
4/5 all the plates for 4 May were made, then on the morning of 5/5 the
semi-hungover overseer of the plate-stamping machine (this is, of
course, one word in German :-) Der UberPflatStampingeWerkeArbeiterFurhrer)
rolled the wrong wheel one digit, making
it say 4/6 instead of 5/5.  :-)  Now all we need to do is find another
bus made on that same day before somebody figured out the mistate.
