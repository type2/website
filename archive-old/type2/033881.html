Subject: The Great Bus Tour Update

My thanks go out to Marv for updating you folks on the passing of the baton
this past weekend. I am just now figuring out how to post and I am sure
someone will let me know if I did it incorrectly.
We had a great time visiting and looking at his many buses! And don't let
him fool you- there was no bribing me to buy that 68 camper- I was in love
the moment I saw it! I am going to have a very hard time waiting until
Spring to bring my new baby home...
I wish everyone in line the best of luck and you are all in for a real
treat- the box of mementos is the BEST!!!
And if anyone has a chance to get their hands on some of Marv's wine, do so!
It is delicious!!!
