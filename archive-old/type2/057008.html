Subject: Re: Commuting in a Bus

&gt; I live in Northern California  and  I've commuted in my 73 Westy for years.(it's orange, so it's a good color in traffic)  Only 20 miles one way but it can take over an hour. I agree with the person that said, if you have to sit in traffic you may as well be in the Bus.  I also take my bike with me to work and with with a little planning. You can get a good work out and have a very comfortable place to clean up and change.  I take the Bus every where and have logged over 30K in the past year. Just remember, Change the oil,
&gt; set the valves and timing and be sure to give it good HUG when it gets you home after a long weekend of camping.  My first VW was in 68 bug and sence then I have owned a 70 bug, 73 bug, 75 squareback, 74bug,  84Jetta, 86Jetta, 89Jetta, restored a 64bug, restored 61Panel Van, 64 Camper, I still own a 60 bug, 73Westy and 94Passat(for the wife). VW's Rule and WE know it!!!! I say shoot the Honda and put your money in the Bus :-)
