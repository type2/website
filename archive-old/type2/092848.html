Subject: Re: [T2] I really need help, folks - - Bosch plugs,Dr Tim,
 and synch the carbs

I don't think I would put Autolites in a Ford let alone a VW or RX-7 (we 
were the ones that tried them in an RX-7 with crummy results). I personally 
have had a few instances just like this with Autolites. And you've helped 
confirm my 'suspicions'.

Call be crazy but I run NGK or Bosch in Japanese vehicles and Bosch only in 
my VW's. Never been burned like that. Champion and Autolite have given me 
fits on a few occasions in my Foreign cars.


&gt; &gt;Crazy - but what brand plugs?
&gt;
&gt; &gt;We had a weird problem with Autolite plugs in an
&gt;RX-7 just like this.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Went back for a set of NGK and all was well.
&gt;
&gt;Put a set of Bosch W8CC in and all is well.  Once
&gt;again the Captain learns not to cheap out.
&gt;(Actually the autolite's were slightly more
&gt;expensive, but they were the only one's FLAPS had
&gt;in stock.)  I usually take Dr. Tim's bosch only
&gt;advice with reservation.  And as usual, he's
&gt;snickering at me.
