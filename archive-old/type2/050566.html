I have used the Pertronix on both the 009 distributor and the stock vacuum
distributor.  It seemed to help the stock distributor more than the 009.
Parts are different by the way.  My 76 Westy had a single progressive Weber,
009 dizzy, and Pertronix and it ran very very well.  I purchased and
installed the original fuel injection from a 78 Westy with the stock vacuum
distributor and points.  Didn't run as well with this setup and it had very
hard erratic misses.  Replaced the points, but still had problems.  I then
replaced the points with a Pertronix for the vacuum dizzy and now it runs
much better.  The Pertronix is easy to install and as long as you don't
accidently cross the wires on the coil it should last forever.  If you do
cross the wires then you can kiss your $65 Pertronix goodbye.  Good luck
with whichever you choose.

Was wondering if those who have replaced their points with an electronic
ignition would care to comment on the process and proformance after the
installation.  I have had some problems recently with my points (you know if
I just bought a new set instead of filing away on them) and was curious.
New points are $2.00 to $3.00, electronic ignition kits are $65.00+, is it
worth the additional cost.
