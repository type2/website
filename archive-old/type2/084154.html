&gt; putting it in.  However, when leaving the shop her mechanic said
&gt; something
&gt; to her - with regard to installing the WR1 - to the effect of &quot;Don't
&gt; put the
&gt; fuse inline with it&quot; (she assumed the &quot;it&quot; to mean the relay kit).
&gt; Does
&gt; this statement make any sense to anyone?  Is there an inline fuse in
&gt; the kit
&gt; that I really should not use?  Is there an additional fuse that a lot
&gt; of
&gt; people install but really shouldn't?  When I installed the WR1 in my
&gt; bus, I
&gt; put it in the way it came - with no problems whatsover since.  Anyway,
&gt; if
&gt; anyone has any idea what this person is talking about, I would
&gt; appreciate
&gt; being enlightened.  Thank you!

I just took a peek at the WR1 relay in my own bus.
There is indeed a fuse holder on the red wire, from
the relay connector to the starter solenoid.  It holds
a 30A spade-type fuse.  I've never had to replace that
fuse and the relay has been working perfectly for well
over 5 years.
