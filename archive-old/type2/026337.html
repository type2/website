	Regarding AFM repairs:

	1.The printed circuit is a ceramic substrate with a fired on
resistive layer. Hard to make at home.
	2. You can enlarge the holes in the substrate to move its position
slightly,
	    or bend the wiper so that the wiper sweeps a different unworn
part of the resistive track.
	3. I seem to remember somewhere once someone saying Bosch actually
lists just the circuit board as an
	    orderable part. I actually seem to remember seeing a catalig
type listing on a web page that listed them with
	    part numbers etc? Does anyone else remember this?

	PS: regarding the backward facing radar thread. It might not be a
good idea to do something that makes someone
	approching you at high speed make a sudden change to what they are
doing, like SLAMMING ON THEIR BRAKES
	just as they overtake you. Better to let them swoosh by you in
steady state?
	I'm also curious about the comment about what you can do (That is
safe) to deal with, or modify the behaviour 
	of someone aproaching from behind with the intent to pass? Please
save any replies to this until FRIDAY;-)
