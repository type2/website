Oh, that's easy...  enlist the aid of a passerby to stand on the
brakes!  Works every time. (But if it doesn't, take your correct sized
socket and head to the local truck tyre fixer.  Have them use the king
sized rattle gun on it.  Tighten it back up by hand, put a cotter pin
back in and drive it home. An additional advantage to this method is
that the drive home will loosen the drum on the splines so that it
comes off easily.)
