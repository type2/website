Subject: Re: [T2] Broken EZ Out &amp; adventures in replacing the rear 
  brakes on a '69 Bus

No problems with ez-out, as long as you use the right size with the right 
drill size. You may heat the screw or use loose nut before you unscrew. When 
it comes to unscrew, use a tap holder, so you wont go crooked.  you should 
not feel any loose anywhere. If you can drill thru the stud it will relief 
prssure on the threads. Before using an easy-out, try unscrew it with a 
small punch and hammer. I made myself an easy out with a worn out 4 lips NPT 
tap that i sharpend. it works fine, and it dont break your heart if it 
breaks. Dont forget to wear SAFETY GLASSES before you try to break your 
broken easy-out.
BTW, you should pronounce EDM instead of EMD. EDM is good but usually 
expensive.
 George gave you really good advices.
