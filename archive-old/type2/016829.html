Subject: Looking for a mechanic in OR...

Yay, it's Friday!  I wasn't sure I could post this until today.

I'm looking for someone to help me with my Mystmobile, to get her
running and drivable.  I don't really want to go to a major auto repair
shop with this unless I have to.

I have this 1971 Transporter baywindow that I've been trying to fix up.
Unfortunately, there seems to be more wrong with it than I can really
do.  I'm a newbie to auto repair but I'm learning and willing to learn.

I tightened the clutch cable about a month ago so that there was just a
little free play in the clutch pedal.  She hasn't been driven at all
(she hasn't been capable) and now, she won't get out of gear once in
gear and I can press the pedal almost to the floor before getting any
real resistance.  It sounds to me like the cable might need replacing,
or worse.  She also needs emergency brake cables or at least needs the
wheels off so they can be checked.

If all that's involved is taking off the wheels and poking around under
the bus to replace/check cables, I think we can do that in the parking
lot of my apartment complex, but anything more than that (like pulling
the engine to replace the clutch plate) isn't allowed there, so she'd
need to be towed (since she's stuck in Reverse).

I want to help whoever I can get to do this so that I can learn what I
need to know, and I'm certainly willing to repay fairly in cash and food
and whatever other negotiations.  I'm in Portland, Oregon, USA.

Pictures of the bus are on http://www.newsguy_dot_com/~bnewman/vw/
