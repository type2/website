John,  Didn't see anyone answer this question for you.  There is a Super Beetle List.  It's not as large or as active as this but it is growing. The emails from it are sporadic, maybe none for acouple days and then one comes around.  Anyway it is:

VwSuperBeetles_at_yahoogroups_dot_com 

Go to:   http://www.geocities_dot_com/bugnut75/index.htm  (join Vw eGroup) to find out more about it.

By the way I'd like to announce a new addition to my air-cooled family, I
finally talked my wife into getting a bug, so for Valentines Day we got her a 1971 Super Beetle with only 60,000 original miles, sweet find!!  So is there the Type 1 equivilent of this Type 2 list where I can get bug advice??
