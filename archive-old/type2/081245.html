Subject: re: Pop Top Liner

Richard et al:

I posted the following on the 10th of April... FYI:

Folks, for what it's worth:

I recently bought a gorgeous Volvo 765 with nary a problem but a
sagging
headliner. I took it to a local Headliners Plus! guy, and was
consequently so

impressed with his work and rates, I went home, drove my 78 Westy
back

to him, and asked what he could do about that godforsaken mildew
stain

on the &quot;fuzzy&quot; crap that lines the inside of the poptop. (I had,
by that point,

spent egregious amounts of money on surely every
commercially-available

product... and nearly killed myself in the process a number of
times:

fumes tend to congregate up there!)

Well, he takes a gander, and in the end, for a mere $250, he
installed a
&quot;marine-grade&quot; headliner, a nice comfy kinda stuff, PADDED mind
you,

and (here's the kicker) applied 3/4&quot; oak strips all the way
around

the inside of the poptop - to which he re-stapled the canvas
(which was
sagging on one side) and screwed them into the fiberglass.

It looks incredible - and is surely the
one-thing-I-didn't-do-myself of
which I am the proudest! I highly encourage other folks to
investigate

similar options, if $250 is reasonable for them.


Cheers!
