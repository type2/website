Subject: Re: [T2] Bleeding Lifters, without doing weird stuff!

When I replaced my lifters a couple months ago I chatted with  
mechanic friends and family and for the most part was counseled to do  
just what you did.  Your technique, while likely not removing every  
last drop of air in the lifter bore, is probably more than adequate  
since the lifters will be completely bled of air when the engine is run.

What I did, and it was messy and a pain in the neck, was to  
disassemble the lifter, then reassemble under 40 wt oil.  The problem  
with this technique is that the bore is completely full of oil and it  
is impossible to push the socket far enough into the lifter bore by  
hand to install the circlip that holds the whole thing together.  I  
ended up buying (for 20 bucks I think) a used 1 or 1.5 ton mechanical  
press to finish with.  The process was like this:
In a pail of SAE 40 wt oil (cheapo brand that someone left in my  
house), disassemble the lifter and get all air out from and off of  
all the parts.
Assemble the lifter under oil.
Transfer the assembled lifter from the pail of oil into a little tub  
of oil on my press.  The tub has enough oil in it to keep the lifter  
totally submerged.  I made sure to not allow air to infiltrate the  
lifter during this very quick transition.
Place the circlip around a section of bug push rod tube.
Center the push rod tube section between the lifter socket and the  
press shaft, then press like hell until the socket is compressed far  
enough to install the circlip.
Using circlip pliers, install the circlip.  This step was, funnily,  
the most difficult since the circlip pliers were oily, the press  
handle was oily the circlip was oily, etc.

After 7 repetitions I was finally just getting the hang of it and  
then there were no more left to do.

When I was done bleeding I couldn't compress those lifters by hand at  
all and I felt good about that, but I came to the realization that  
most likely in this case good enough is really adequate and I should  
have just bled them using your system, installed them, and allowed  
the engine oil pressure to finish the job.  My technique was a lot of  
work.

Just thought I'd post on a topic with which I've recently become  
acquainted... lurking is alright, but it's nice to come out of the  
woodwork every once in a while.

Best Regards,

Zack

&gt; Maybe this was common sense? But if it helps anyone, then I'm glad  
&gt; I posted
&gt; it.
