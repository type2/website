&gt; I rev it a bit and it promptly dies after much trying it starts again and
&gt; now displays the systems of doing nothing when the accelerator

--&gt; Check all your vacuum hoses.  These sound like vacuum leak symptoms,
though there are other things that could cause them.  Maybe you knocked a
hose loose somehow? The fuel injection system on the VW is very sensitive
to any air leaks.  This will sound silly, but make sure your oil filler
cap is on tight...the crankcase breather is connected into the system too,
so any air leak into the crankcase can make it run badly.

&gt; 1. Does fixing the terribly leaking exhaust magnify the problem in #3
&gt; resulting in this current state?

--&gt;  I can't think of why it would.

&gt; 
&gt; 2.What is causing this unwillingness to run?

--&gt; Vacuum leak, bad connection in the ignition or FI systems...could be a
lotta things.  It should at least run and drive on 3 cylinders...not well,
but it will go.  I've done it before, but for a different reason.

&gt; I need to drive around for the next couple weeks and do about 700-800
&gt; miles before I have time to drop the engine.  When I drop it I plan to
&gt; replace the heads with two rebuilt AVP heads.  Should I do rings to?  Does
&gt; that mean cylinders have to be honed?  Any info is appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Is this realistic?  If I fix whatever is wrong now can I drive around on
&gt; three cylinders for two weeks?  I think I have bee for two months?  Is
&gt; that possible?

--&gt;  It's possible, but be careful.  The engine will be underpowered on
three, you'll be running with heavy throttle.  It's very very easy to
overheat the engine under these conditions, and then you may end up with
valve problems on the other side, too.

Speaking of valves, are they adjusted properly?  If you took the rockers
off, you need to re-adjust them.  The procedure is different for
hydraulics than for solid lifters -- you can find it in the archives.
