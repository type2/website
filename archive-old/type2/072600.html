Subject: sealant under the jugs

The first few times I rebuilt ac engines,  I did not use any sealant
between the cylinders and the case. This was many years ago, but I don't
recall ever having leaks there.

Last year, I had to rebuild a 1600 and a 1776 and faithfully followed the
advice that appears in every one of my recent publications and how-to
books; namely, to use RTV sealant in this location, especially  if spacers
are used  to lower the compression.

The result was (1) a small leak was present on the 1776, and (2),  and I
think much more important,  the RTV is impossible to remove.  For the 1776
rebuild that I'm doing now, I had to trash the spacers and buy new ones
because they  bent as I tried to pry them off the cylinders.

The implications of thus  for me are daunting.  I installed the heads two
weeks ago but, while the engine is still on the test stand, I  would like
to go back in there to install O-rings on the valve stems. I won't,
however,  because I can't face the  thought of trying to remove all that
RTV.   I would much rather not use the stuff and make re-entry a piece of
cake.

So..........  my question:  Does everyone use sealant?  Is there anyone out
there who doesn't  and  who doesn't have leaks?

Thanks, Jack
