Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Questions about the metal fuel line to fuel
  pump in  1600DP

I had no idea VW only built cars to last a &quot;few years at the most&quot;. Since my new grommet is of newer materials maybe that's why it's lasted 5 years and still is plyable?
   
  No offense but i'll stick with it, plus it looks much better.

&gt; Wrapping your line with a rubberband, innertube or piece of gum is
not a good idea. Why not do it they way you should. The above should
help you to see how.

Actually, the factory grommet is the cause of a lot of problems because it
tends to deteriorate fairly quickly. It was the lowest cost solution for
vehicles that were expected to have a service life of a few years at most.

The inner-tube-rubber wrap is much more robust and will last longer than
the factory grommet. In addition, when it does start to fail it will do
so slowly, whereas the factory grommet will simply fall out of the hole,
starting the &quot;sawing&quot; process before an inspection catches the problem.

The Hoover method is the Cadillac solution for those who are willing to
put in the extra effort.

Just because the factory did it a particular way does not mean that there
aren't better ways of doing it!
