Subject: Berg Rocker Arm Assemblies

I recently invested in a  Berg rocker arm shaft kit.  My stock shafts were
ok. It was one of those situations where I was placing a large order and
got caught up in the description in the Berg catalog.

I'm confused by these new kits. The warpy washers on the stock assembly
keep tension on  the rockers and still allow easy rocking on the shaft. For
the Berg kit:
        1. there is no counterpart of the warpy washers to supply tension
        2. the adjusters do not intersect the valve stem just off center
unless I were to somehow shave the blocks
        3. no combination of the shims supplied will place the four
adjusters on each shaft  close to the axes of the valve stem shafts

All in all, it seems that a lot of work has to be invested to achieve the
alignment and smooth operation that was automatic for the stock kits.

Has anyone else come to this conclusion?  I'm open to suggestions as to
something that I have overlooked.

Jack
