&gt;      Sorry for this but just remembered another unrelated bus prob.
&gt; As i was driving home along with the brake warning light snag the bus was
&gt; sluggish at low rpms and would stall at a stop.
&gt; Checking at home (45 min drive) i noticed the right hand intake manifold(73
&gt; westy dual stock carbs) was white,
&gt; Ice! Man i thought the type 4 with the short manifolds was almost immune to
&gt; this but it was ice.
&gt; Would this cause the stalling?
yes, ice could definitely cause stalling!

&gt; Cure?
This is a bald ass guess, so take it for that, but i'd bet you dont have a
working thermostat... with no thermostat and a cool outside temperature
your engine wont get up to operating temperature and thus will ice as the
manifolds dont get hot.

My other guess:
the plugs on that side arent firing well and thus that head isnt getting
up to temp, since with no or incomplete combustion that head wont get as
hot, it wont get the manifold as hot then you ice... (this may actually be
more likely than the non-working therm as your problem is only on one
side..)

so, since i am an amateur mechanica just like you and no expert, these may
be nowhere near the solution but might be worth a shot.

Peas,

Steve
