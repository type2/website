&lt;&lt; With all the talk of Corvair prices rising I was not suprised to see this 
ad
in the local paper: &quot;VW Camper Van '73 fresh paint, Corvair engine and
transaxle, 4 sp. toilet, icebox, sink $70,000 . . .&quot;  I know what these are
worth without the Corvair parts, so the Corvair power must make the difference
in price.  Everyone be nice to Chris Mills, he is sitting on a goldmine. Glad
I bought my Corvair stuff early (althought it is mostly LM).

Nah, It's not the bus itself, nor the Corvair parts that make it worth
$70,000...It's that '4 sp. toilet'...Whooosh ;-)
