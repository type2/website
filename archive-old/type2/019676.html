&gt; Subject: [T2] Need Tow Bar for '73 Bus
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone know who makes a tow bar for the late model buses?
&gt; 
&gt; I need to tow a bus next weekend and would like to buy or borrow one.
&gt; 
&gt; I live near St. Louis.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.
&gt; 
&gt; btw, tried searching the archives, but they are not currently working.

I'd consider a universal tow bar like those sold at motor home, RV
dealers. My brother bought one for $50-100 range, it was cheaper than
renting one from U-haul one way! I've used it and it's pretty rugged.
Just take the bumper off the brackets and bolt the tow bar brackets to
the bumper brackets. (maybe should drill the holes out to a bigger size,
seems like on the 73-79 those 4 bolts are only 8 mm!)
