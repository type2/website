Subject: Re: CHT sensor location

The number 3 plug is the preffered location, but I have always had trouble
getting the plug in without mangling the ring (dual port, upright motor.) My
next engine uses 12mm x 3/4&quot; reach plugs and I was wondering where a suitable
alternative would be for the CHT sensor mount? Under the washer next to the
head stud by the #3 intake port? Thought about under the washer for the #3
exhaust port stud, but was afraid the exhaust gas temps would give me
unrealistically high head temp numbers. Any other suggestions?
Tim
