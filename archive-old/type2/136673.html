Subject: altitude adjustment

If you had an EFI engine you would merely flip the
altitude switch (or if you were among the very few
with a automatic altitude switch you would do
nothing).  Since you are carborated I guess you can
just lean the mixture screws down a little.  5000
feet.  Less air.  You need less fuel in that air. 
Going to get less power also.  Sea level is sort of a
natural ram injection system.
