Actually, no, its not a joke, althought not on my '72 westy.....some models 
you press the button to test if the brake failure indicator is working, if it 
lights, then it  is.  I suggest you get your facts straight before you insult 
my intelligence by laughing at me simply because you've &quot;never heard of that 
one&quot;.
Don't believe me?  Look it up in a service manual.
