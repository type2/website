Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Breakdown in CA: Help needed (Update IT'S
  FIXED!!!!)

I see people talk about this subject alot.  What I want to know is, what do
I replace them with so I don't have to do this every year?  I mean is there
some upgraded hose out there that is designed to last longer than a few
years?  (I am going for reliability here not &quot;I'm lazy and want something
that will last forever so I don't have to think about it&quot;)

I guess this leads me to another question.   What is it about busses that
make life so difficult for the fuel lines?  Is it just age or a combination
of factors that make busses so prone to fuel line problems?   Maybe its jus=
t
my being naieve and maybe this is common with all old cars but it seems
particularly important with busses.

&gt; umm, would this be a good time to say 'everyone replace your fuel lines?'
&gt;
&gt; if you don't know how old your fuel lines are, or if they're more than
&gt; __ years old--
&gt; REPLACE YOUR FUEL LINES!!!
&gt;
&gt; ALL OF THEM!!!
