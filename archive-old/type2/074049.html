&gt; I'm just about ready to have the engine work on my 71 Westy done.
&gt; &gt;From what I have been get from the list it a good idea to go back to the Vac.

Yes, unless you go to a 30PICT-1 carb.  The PICT-2 and -3 carbs don't get
along with 009s

&gt; Also the generator needs to be replace the key is going.  Though I should

Get the alternator, but forget the kit.  The stand and tin provided in all
the kits I've seen is chinese/taiwanese and doesn't fit well.  I ended up
scrounging the bits I needed from the wrecker.  I feel much better with
the VW symbol on the parts (though I'm a bit skeptical of the Audi symbol
on the alternator stand.  How many Audis had type 1 engines?

You need an AL82N alternator.  You also need the generator tin (3 pieces)
for an alternator, the alternator fan hub (the 38A generator hub won't
work well), and the alternator stand.  None of these bits should be hard
to find, as late model bugs came with them standard.  Some have said that
the 38A generator pulley is different, but I could see no misalignment
with my pulley either on the generator or alternator.

You'll need to do a bit of adapting of the wiring.  I made double-ended
spade terminals out of copper sheet to bypass the regulator and connnect
to the alternator.  No wires need to be cut or spliced.

&gt; Now for the big one the engine has some were around 60+K on it and smokes at
&gt; start up if setting for a day or two.
&gt; So, time for new heads or at lest some work should be done.  I would like to
&gt; get more power for the hills and freeway I was use to driving a 72 Westy with
&gt; an 1800cc so the 1600cc is just a little slow. This not say that I run at
&gt; 80mph, 70mph is plenty fast for the bus.
&gt;
&gt; The question is can we go up in size with new cylinder and piston and still
&gt; get a strong and reliable engine that will run cool and stay together?

Personally, I don't like to spin my stock 1600 faster than about 62MPH,
where it seems happy.  If you want to go faster, look into taller gears in
the transmission to go with that beefier engine.  Bring your Visa card!

Since you're looking at a lot of money here, perhaps you might be happier
with a later model bus.  There's a lot to be said for type 4 power.
