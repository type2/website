engine off,   12 plus a bit
engine on,    10 and a half +-

??????

&gt; Check the voltage with just the positive  coil wire not  hooked to
&gt; anything....referenced against the voltage from battery terminal to
&gt; battery terminal...why is it different?

12+ same all direction
&gt;
&gt; Got anything else wired to the positive side of the coil that might be

couple LED's testing in the tailight, but disconected get same readings

&gt; drawing a lot of power?....or something wired in with it up front when you
&gt; turn the key on?  How much voltage from the positive wire at the front

not that I am aware of

&gt; of the bus...once again?  different from battery terminal to battery
&gt; terminal?

same (or very close, have twin batteries one seems a little lower than the
other by a few fractions, shouldn't be enough to matter, also I have
isolated each battery while running and no difference
 &gt;
&gt; Checked trans to body ground strap?  I think you *did* finally go thru
&gt; your electrical and if I remember correctly, put on the really nice battery
&gt; straps and connectors?

bypassed
&gt;
&gt; Run a wire straight from your battery pos side to the coil...with nothing
&gt; else hooked to the positive side of the coil and then see what your spark
&gt; looks like...

forgot this check when out there, will try next

that lower voltage to coil from ignition seems to be a hint at something
maybe a relay on the coil wire might help run, but won't solve the
underlying problem, in fact the Pertronix may have kept the engine running
long after it would normally have failed

 thanks
