Subject: Re: [T2] Bruck Germany

BRUCK is a repackager like most companies today;

Oil cooler&lt;  Hecho en Mexico but a much better quality then Premiun Gualitat out of Brazil
Starter &lt; Hecho en Mexico

Alt/gen pulley&lt;    Germany stamped on pulley, but not &quot;Made in Germany&quot; (a deceptive practice) like trans craddle
mounts that say Germany on them but are actualy made in India.

Another company Pierberg, Germany at least kind of tells you where some stuff is made. Pierberg carbs and fuel 
pumps are made in China, but excellent quality compared to Borosol or Bocar

VDO&lt; Pakistan and other 3rd world countries on the low end cockpit gauges and senders

A lot of the rubber out of Europe is made in Tailand now and called German and/or England. So far in my testing the 
rubber seems to be holding up except the glue joints break easily

&gt;Has anyone seen the new oil coolers and starters from a company called Bruck?

&gt;
&gt;The parts are advertized as OE German quality and you can see some Germany text right on the box. The local VW 
resto shop told me that there is a company in Brazil called Germany and that is where these parts actually come from. 
Anybody know the scoop?
