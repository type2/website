Subject: Re: My VW van altitude problems.  Help me, please!

&gt; ...I was wondering
&gt; if you could explain what you know of altitude's effect on the function of
&gt; one's Type 2 V.W. Westfalia.  I only had a chance to get your address (and
&gt; did not read the entire note) from the list attached to the Type2_dot_com
&gt; website, and I was intrigued by what I believe was an issue with the
&gt; camshaft of your van that resulted from use at altitude.

If you'd read my whole message, you'd have seen that it was mostly an
appeal for information from wise, techie, mechanic types on the list.
I'm no expert on this subject. Sorry. And it was my crankshaft, not
camshaft that broke while driving hard in low gear at 10K feet. Still,
there may be something in common between your breakdown and mine.

As another poster noted, at high elevation the compresson is lower because
there is less air per unit volume.  I've also wondered if the fuel mixture
might become richer with less air per unit volume in a device that metes
out fuel by measuring airflow.

The symptom you notice is that bus gets very sluggish- loses power. John
Muir recommends advancing timing to compensate. Others have said this is
less good than doing some combination of timing adjustment and fuel mix
adjustment, but I don't know just how. The most recent round of posts seem
to mention only picking (usually increasing) the compression ratio.

Fuel mix and timing can be adjusted on an engine without much trouble. You
could do this for a trip to the mountains and undo it when back at sea
level, if necessary.  Adjusting compression requires rebuilding engine and
adding/ removing shims.  under the cylinders or swapping heads.
Impractical to do just for a high trip.

I'd hoped to receive more feedback
from others by my post. We'll see what comes in over the next few days.
