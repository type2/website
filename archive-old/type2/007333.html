dirty maybe, but removing the firewall panel is a lot quicker than cutting

Very true, but how do you get the fuel sender out without pulling the tank?
 Seems to me that cutting the hole would be a lot quicker than pulling the
engine.  Of course if I had to do this on my 74, I certain I would yank the
engine since no PO's have cut the hole (finally, one thing the PO's didn't
do to screw things up!)
