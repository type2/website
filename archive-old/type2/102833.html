&gt; This is just what should have happened. Don't forget that the switch trips

&gt; The new one comes on at under 11 psi. Your oil pressure at idle was 10 psi.
&gt; With the old switch, you never got the light because it trips at below 6.4
&gt; psi. When you switched to the VDO dual sender, you get the light on at ~10
&gt; psi, because the VDO sender trips the switch at 11 psi or below.  I don't
&gt; think anything is broken or malfunctioning in this scenario.

Whoops! you're right scott, I was bass ackwards. But I'd still like to
know if the rebuild had an aftermarket switch or the origional one
