Subject: still overheating???

This morning I disconnected the Gene Berg dipstick temperature sensor, and
put the original dipstick back in. Then it was straight to the highway for a
cruise at 60 mph for 1 hour 15 minutes. The bus ran fine, and I felt much
better since there was no red light glaring me in the face. When I got home,
I shut off the engine, and then started it right back up. The engine
compartment did seem pretty warm, but there was no other signs of
overheating. Wouldn't there have been loss of power while cruising along at
60 if it was actually overheating? This bus is heading to Kansas City as
soon as I can pack it up.
