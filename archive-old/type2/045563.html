Subject: re: [T2] Help, just bought my first bus

If it runs well, I wouldnt be concerned, but then I am addicted to fuel
injection, what the heck would I know?

&gt;1.  My bus has a single carb, but I thought they had duals, am I mistaken,
&gt;or has some type of conversion been done?  Should I have concwens about
&gt;this?

Your bus used to have air conditioning...

&gt;2.  Underneath the bus in the center there is what appears to be a large
&gt;radiator/heat exchanger type of device with hoses coming out of each end.
&gt;Two of the hoses are in the engine compartment, where the auxiliary bettery
&gt;would be, but are not connected. Not sure yet where the other two end up.
&gt;Any ideas.

The fridge should work on AC, the aux battery isnt necessary unless you want
the fridge to work while driving. I personally never use mine but as an
icebox, drop in a couple of those freezer things and it stays coooooold for
a couple days.

&gt;3. There is no aux battery, will the fridge work anyway, or does it neeed
&gt;the other battery.  I plugged it in to A/C and it did nothing, I will need
&gt;to investigate further.

Dont follow too closely, get a 'Too Slow? Too Bad&quot; sticker and enjoy....

&gt;Any other tips for a new owner?
