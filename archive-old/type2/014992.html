&gt;Hey all, first the stats, '77 type 2, 2.0 L fuel injected, stock,

&gt;My bus has developed what I think may be a more serious than not
&gt;problem.  It was running great, I mean great, then in the course of no
&gt;more than a half hour it stopped running.  I felt an initial couple of
&gt;small hesitations...

Vacuum hoses. Start with the one on the back driver's side of the air
exchange/plenum/whatever-you-call-that box in the middle. There's a T
connector there that plugs into the side of the box and then into 2 big
hoses, including the one that goes to the brake booster. I've had to
replace that T with a copper plumber's fitting. The geometry of the
connections caused this aging rubber connector to break apart.

I'm pretty confident you'll find your problem in the vacuum connections or
hoses.

Have fun! Joe
