Subject: Rear Seat from 79 Std

I have a black std seat out of my bus when putting in the folding bed.
It's in good shape with only minor rips (only one I think) This is the
regular type that folds down w/ the carpet on the back side. Comes w/
all hardware etc. Price? Free. Only you must either get it or live
near enough to me that's it's not a hard trip.  Location Dickson, TN
45 minutes west of Nashville.
