Yes, Terry K..
  I think you are right. Practice would be good. The two old beater =
trucks
would do nicely, for starters.
  As for liking this, well.. I didn't really expect to enjoy painting =
cars..
although, you never know. If anything is to enjoy, it is a good result, =
and
early success can help to ensure many more repeats. So, it is not a =
waste to
invest in something good if one has the determination to follow through =
and
use it. I feel a lot more free about small investments now.. so easy to =
sell
your &quot;mistakes&quot; on eBay! If I bought a nice system and decided that I
absolutely hated painting, someone would be happy to take my &quot;buyer's =
goof&quot;
off my hands for a reasonable price, at least after a few tries.. I =
wouldn't
lose all.  Jan B
