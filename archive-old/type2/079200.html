Subject: Metal fuel line

I was replacing some fuel lines and reinstalling my fuel pump yesterday.
I noticed that the metal line that is above the tranny is
rusted real bad. I was going to use a piece of brake line, but wanted to
make sure that will be ok first. Do they sell metal fuel
line in lengths like brake line?

Happy Holidays!
