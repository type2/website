Subject: Water injection problem(please use the delete function if you
  don't want to look)

On my 80 Westy aircooled W/Water Injection. I have a
problem with the water working all the time. I fill
the tank(it is above the engine, so I have a cut off
valve to use when system is not on)the problem is that
on trips the water works for a while then stops,
around town it does the job quite well keeping the
head temp between 270 and 325. Could it be that at
cruising speeds there is not enough vacuum to draw the
water into the engine. My water inlet is just behind
the throttle valve at the distributor air pick up line
for the advance on the distributor(have a #22 needle
plugged in to the line). Guess I'm going to have to
get a vacuum gage and look for a better source. I am
putting the automatic cut off valve(12V) back on , it
was working fine, I forget to turn the manualone off
and am getting tired of pulling the plugs to clear the
water from the engine. Phil
