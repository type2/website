Subject: Bug-o-Rama swap Share a space?

I'm caught by the short hairs by the promoters and need to get into swap
($90 camp,swap and 3kids) and was wondering if anyone has some parts they
want me to bring into the swap for them in exchange for splitting the swap
cost? I'll have a 1/2 rack and part of the bed on my 68 DC which will be for
sale. I'm coming up on Saturday from the Stockton area and could swing by
peoples homes in the Sac. area if need be. I hope that this is OK with the
promoters, you'd think they'd be OK with more parts in the swap.
Britt

Probably should P-mail me.
