Subject: [T2] Transmission - interchangable years?


&gt; I just recently purchased a 74' westy and I would like to install a 2.0 from
&gt; a 78 sunroof bus I have.  I was woundering if the transmission are
&gt; interchangable or do I have to change that as well??  I believe the 74 had a
1700cc
&gt; originally and the PO installed a 1600cc that is now out of the bus.....
&gt; Please let me know know if the tranny will work..

Hi Mike Q,,, do you have a garage that fits a 74ft westy?  :-) Just kidding ,, I
knew you meant a '74

Let me assume a few things,,   assuming you talking manual to manual
transmissions... and assuming the po hasn't already interchanged things,,,

I think you will find you can easily interchange the engine and the trans from
the 78 into the 74 body

Things to think about...

change out the transmission upper hanger as it has the correct throttle tube
welding in place for EFi
put the 78 hanger in the 74  body.

change out the shifter as it is a straight one instead of the bent one in the 74
put the 78 shifter in the 74 body

you'll probably have to drill a new dimple in the hockey stick to allow the
shifter to select 2nd and 4th ,, the new hole needs to be about 12mm towards the
trans nose cone... if you go toooo far back,, you won't be able to select 1st
and 3rd... so make sure you put the hockey stick in 1st or 3rd and leave a
millimeter or 2 clearance between the shift rod coupling and the nose cone
bushing seal area.

If you staying with carbs.. you will need to rejet them...

If your going to EFi.. you'll need the throttle cable interchanged too. and the
Brake booster will need a vac line,, which is different between the 74 and the
78.. you can improvise pretty easily

You will need to install an electric fuel pump... as the 74 had a mechanical
pump on the engine case.. and the 2.0 liter will not have that.

Hope that helps
