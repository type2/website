&gt; Very strange experience, what with the difficulty finding 1st and
2nd, (someone put in a weird aftermarket shifter), 

The shifting may have nothing to do with the shifter.  It probably has
more to do with the linkage underneath.  I can't find the microfiche
for reference, so this is all from my messing with my '72.  Some or all
of this may be irrelevant for you.  There's a bar coming out of the
nose of the transmission that has a squared-off U-shaped thing on it. 
The ends of the U point toward the front (FIF).  This connects to the
rear-end of the linkage with a bolt through 2 pieces of plastic and the
linkage in this order: bolthead | rubber or plastic bushing | linkage |
rubber or plastic bushing | nut.  Now, when I got my bus the rubber
bushings were gone.  Not torn up, mind, you, gone.  I couldn't find 1st
or second either.  The PO couldn't either, and he bent the shifter
looking for it.  The shifting was solved by replacing the plastic bits.

If the aftermarket shifter is chrome and has the word &quot;scat&quot; written on
it, its probably a &quot;short throw&quot; shifter.  Any problems in your linkage
will be magnified by this shifter.  Once you get your linkage all
squared away, though, they're pretty nice - cuts the shifter travel
between gears by half, and it has a reverse lockout so you can't
accidentally put it in reverse while looking for second.  If you don't
want it, they go new for over $100, so you could probably sell it
pretty easily.  Scat is the only aftermarket shifter I know anything
about, and I've grown kind of attached to mine.  I just wish it wasn't
chrome - it looks out of place, too neat and clean looking.
 
&gt; Also who carries the best quality aftermarket parts for restoration?

that'll start an email flurry :)  Personally, I like BusDepot when the
local Local ACVW place doesn't have what I need.

Good luck with your project,
