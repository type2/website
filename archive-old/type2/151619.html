&gt;Rust Bullet works great for me.

I, too, have used RustBullet and am very pleased.
Basically, scrub off loose rust with a wire brush
and paint this stuff on....2 coats. And that's it.

I did a test on a section of my roof with POR-15.
Followed the instructions to the letter. It's not
holding up. Not to mention too many steps. The
section on my roof that I used RustBullet has held
strong. No signs of rust reappearing.  I also painted
my heater tubes outboard of the engine, they still look
good too.

I would also like to try the MasterSeriesCT coating.
I believe it is similar to RustBullet.
