Subject: Re: [T2] Type4 Aluminium Valve covers

Robert,

I think it's also been discussed that the painting of the stock steel (tin)
covers flat black assists in the heat dissipation (oil cooled).  I had a
problem with a leak that turned out to be a warped (just enough) steel
cover;  I can imagine that aluminium would distort quicker if your engine
got hot enough....

Maybe I've just listened to the &quot;Stock is God&quot; lectures too long, but except
for some technological advances (pointless ignition, etc...) I throw my lot
in with the &quot;VW designed it that way for a reason&quot; theories.  YMMV.

Good luck.
