Message-ID: &lt;19991004160215.13093.qmail_at_aw164_dot_netaddress_dot_usa_dot_net&gt;

USA listees,

Trying to pinch pennies here.

Any chance of one of you having one 1974 (big valve) 1800 head you could part
with?
You can tell its a 74 by the presence of air injection ports in the exhaust
ports and the 41mm intake valve.
 
Only requirements are:

-not cracked (you would have cleaned it and checked)

-no sunken seats

I would prefer that it not have been flycut, but if i can't get a stock deck
height thats okay.

I may also m be interested in an FI head. I don't think  a 2mm difference in
intake valve size on one side of the engine would cause catastrophic failure -
actually, that is a question: 

What would be the ramifications of using a big-valved, carb head on one side
and a small-valved FI head on the other side, provided all other dimensions
are identical?
C'mon you MEs - think back to your days at the 'test engine'...

Would i lop down the road at a tilt, my bus thinking &quot;i should've had a V8..&quot;
? That is a joke.

You can keep the valves and rocker assembly and stripped/broken/stuck studs
are not a problem.

I do have sources for rebuilt/new heads but i'm a big fan of flea markets and
obslete psrts searches so i figured i'd try this first.

If you have one you can stand to part with, quote me a price. I'm sure you can
beat the fellas in the glossy magazines 
&quot;with the cirles and arrows and the paragraph on the back of each one
explainin' what each one was to be used as evidence against us.&quot;
Who knows that quote? ;]

Thanks for your help,

Clark in Ky
