Subject: Re: [T2] My bus is being violated!

'BUS RELATED SECURITY SYSTEM THREAD'
Go dumpster diving behind an electronics shop for some free video cameras.
Place a couple in the bus to look like surveillance.  It doesn't matter if
they don't work...nobody has to know.  For authenticity, buy a couple of
battery operated LED's for a dollar or so and stick them on the cam so it
looks like them buggers are working.  It's kinda like the folks who place
security system stickers on their doors and windows at home and get the same
results as those who actually pay for the systems. Temporarily affix some
NRA stickers to the bus too. A few spent shell casings tossed onto the front
seat may be helpful. Hehehe, this can be as fun as you want it to be.
Peace, love, and zero tolerance of bus rapists,
Jay
PS: If by chance you don't take this as tongue-in-cheek, seek counselling.


Hello all!

     My poor bus is being violated, I work right by a high school, in
fact I park in the teachers parking lot. Anyway school has just started,
and now things are being stolen, First Tuesday my Billet aluminium valve
stem caps were stolen after being on all summer, Yesterday was my day
off, so nothing was stolen, Then today when I got off one of my center
caps are missing, from my alloy wheels, I bought new one's from bus
depot, and they fit to tight to fall off, plus I checked my wheels this
morning and it was there, and I doubt it fell off by it's self and
walked off.

     The school doesn't have any camera's over looking the parking lot,
and the cops won't do anything unless I can prove who did it. I'm
getting so mad,  I might hurt someone. I guess I'll have to buy a old
beater just to drive to work, something not worth stealing off of.
well thanks for listening!

Thanks,
Shawn Reed
