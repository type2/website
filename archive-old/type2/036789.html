&gt;A 1970, ugly beigish color ....

Kudos on getting your first bus. In time, you will learn much about the
mechanics and lore of type 2s. First lesson: you know that &quot;ugly&quot; beigish
color? If it's the stock paint, you have a classic VW color on your
hands. Go have a look at the back cover of Laurence Meredith's _Original
VW Bus_ (Bay View Books, 1997). There's the color, albeit on a 1969 bus.
============

Yes, that is my bus on the back cover ! I bought it a year ago. The story of
how I got it is on my website (see below). The colour is called Savannah
Beige and I quite like it. Mine has a 'cloud white' roof and it's all
original (non-restored) and  still shiney. The interior sometimes smells
'new' (well after I spray 'cockpit cleaner').

This bus is getting to be quite famous and just 2 days ago I put in another
appearance for a 'car' program on TV. They were shooting an item on 50 years
of VW Transporters. We had 3 splits (one samba, a panel and the infamous
'hot dog' bus, see clubsite), my '69er was representing the bay window
models while my Vanagon was used for the T3 (That's Transporter 3rd
generation) era. Pon (still the importer of VWs in Holland) had supplied a
T4 (Eurovan to you in the US). That was a panel van with double seating
(extra bench and windows behind the driver but otherwise enclosed cargo
space). The T4 was a TDI with lots of HP and the presenter of the program
tried to take some corners on 3 wheels. I would not have been surprised if
it had toppled over. The shooting took about 5 hours mostly on a cold and
wet parking lot in the middle of nowhere. The final item will be something
like 5 minutes on TV.
