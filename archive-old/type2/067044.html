&gt;Where you live: State, city, and a nearest big city (to help me locate

Tallahassee, FL (Roughly halfway between Tampa, FL and Atlanta, GA)

I'm only about 2 miles from the Interstate (I-10) and would be happy 
to help out old dubsters stranded amid what one poet at the local 
coffeehouse called &quot;this violent and misogynistic North Florida 
redneck cultural milieu.&quot;  Wee-ha.  I don't promise it'll be that 
entertaining EVERY night, though.

&gt;you on a map!) What is you van: year, model What is your name: What is

Alas, I'm presently a wannabus, thought I've owned ones named Berta, 
Maj. Hangover, and Half Fast.  I'm partial to splitties and loafs up 
to '71.
