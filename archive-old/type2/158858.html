Subject: Re: [T2] Start Problem

Thanks for all the tips.  Further investigation revealed that with the 
ignition on and the air flow meter flap moved by hand the fuel pump was 
not activating, it did for a second  at one point then not again.  I 
tested the dual relay as per the  Sean Bartnik article and it failed the 
part where you connect terminals 85 and 88b indicating the power relay 
is bad.  I decided to try that trick of running power from the coil 
direct to the fuel pump but despite great hope it made no difference.  A 
reread of Bartniks article and I realized  a bad power relay would 
result in most of the injection system not being powered.  Is this 
correct?  I'm not sure if I can rule out a bad air flow meter fuel pump 
safety switch or not?  I suppose I'm going to order a new dual relay but 
in the mean time how do I grind the points on the relay? I doesn't look 
like its designed to be opened.

Thank You

Ashley

The problem turned out to be a bad surface on the
points inside the double relay. One of the relays is
used to switch the pump power from start (work when
the starter is running) to normal running (when the
AFM is letting air through).

I fixed the problem by grinding down the points, but
I'll have to get a new double relay at some point...
