Roland,

Yes, I know the tin you speak of.

There is a big metal snapper thingy that holds the rocker arm cover 
on REEEAAALYY tight.

I wrestle that thing down off the cover, I guess after removing the 
tin, but then I have to work over the heat exchangers, risking dirt 
contamination in my engine. That is all.

Now, there are 4 rocker arms, 2 intake, 2 exhaust, one each per 
cylinder. I am told there is an assembly held on by bolts on either 
side and I can remove the bolts, then remove the rocker arm and 
get at the tube, is this correct?

Also I heard reference to crankcase pressure being a bad thing 
when you can feel air at the open dipstick.

I don't get it, can someone enlighten me?

&gt; remove the heat exchangers!
