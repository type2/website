Subject: Re: [T2] best rubber for sliding window on my 78

I'm not sure what issues Mike has had with WCM.  But here's my take on their
rubber products:

WCM does a pretty darn good job of manufacturing most of their weatherstrip
and rubber items.  I pay them this compliment primarily because even though
Loren Pearson and I have been good friends for over 30 years, my only issue
has been that the window rubber, while made of excellent
quality UV-resistant EPDM it has too much &quot;filler&quot; to allow for less
expensive production.  This results in a somewhat &quot;stiffer&quot; feeling seal
even though the durometer (called shore hardness&quot; in the rubber biz) was the
same as my rubber was made, which was usually out of &quot;aircraft grade&quot; EPDM,
a more expensive , but purer and better quality EPDM seal, which is softer
and easier to install.  And because it's somewhat less pliable to handle
when installing, it can make the installation a less than enjoyable
experience.

The Wolfsburg West window seals are made at the same place I use to have
mine made and their EPDM material formulation compound is a lot closer to
mine, but it is slightly different.  But it is softer than WCM's.

Many former customers have asked why I discontinued my product(s) and the
answer was simple.  I didn't want to compromise on what I felt was a better
made seal, so being that my costs were becoming too high to compete, I
decided at that time that most (but not all) people were concerned with
price (especially those going with the cheeper Brazilian &amp; Taiwan made
stuff) rather than quality.  With that in mind I wasn't keen on digging the
hole I was in any deeper and decided it was time to let the other vendors
fight over price and/or quality.  There just aren't enough buyers or a
market out there looking for quality to support the continued manufacture of
the best window rubber ever made.  A biased opinion you might say, but I
heard that same opinion voiced from way too many customers over the past 25+
years to fully consider it biased.  And Old Volks Home did it before anyone
else decided later on to cash in on the window rubber in cheeper product.  I
still have several people every month that badger me to re-activate my
tooling (I still have it all, ready to go) and go back into production, but
I'd end up giving away the farm, what very little of it is left.
Health/Heart issues over the past 7 years have sucked a good part of what
little retirement savings I had and I don't see myself winning the Super
Lotto, Mega-Millions or Powerball anytime soon to throw money back into it.

But ya never know, maybe someday.......

&gt; Hey guys, what are the WCM issues? I have a bus full of it via Bus Depot
&gt; as I recall and am wondering if I could do better next time. Noticed one
&gt; of the rear side windows has a seal that is dying 7 yrs later outside
&gt; 100% of the time. Everything else looks okay and seals fine.
