Subject: Re: Re: [T2] Re: Hurricane Wilma

&gt;If he did buy a 68-72, would he be able to easily convert it back to a
sunroof bus rather than a Westfalia bus?

I don't think the drain tubes were installed at the factory if the vehicle
was to be a camper, I know my 70 westy don't have em... holes are there but
no drain tubes.

On my 74 sunroof bus the front drain tubes run down the B pillar and exits
out the bottom and the rear drain tubes exits out in the rear engine cooling
vents. I've seen some buses with middle drain tubes as well.
