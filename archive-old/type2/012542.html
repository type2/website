&gt;okay, so VW had a tool so you could replace ball joints without using
&gt;a press. does anybody have a part# for it. I can't find one in the Hazet
catalog.

I have no idea if this will work on a Bus but I was surfing and noticed it.
 The
bus join it a hare bigger than most american style FWD joints though so...
