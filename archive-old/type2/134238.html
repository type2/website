Subject: RE: [T2] VW air cooled background

Good day Ben, It was my pleasure, I had the ghia and the beetle done a
while ago....I tried to find  Bays illustration but in vain, the only
type 2 that I found was the &quot;champagne splitty&quot;.. And yesterday, gladly,
I found at thesamba_dot_com mouse pad,  the one with the black beetle and
the yellow split window..._dot_decided to make a background with it.

But has today, I have found none.. But if someone have one.. I will make
a background no problem... As I am personally a Bay fan.....

Heh

Cheers

Patrick

Dear Patrick:

Many thanks: for the cool backgrounds.

Now a question.  Does anyone have artwork of a similar vein for Bay 
Westy's and busses?

Thanks,

BEN
