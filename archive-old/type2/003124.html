&gt; Rear piece is simple.  Just remove all the phillips screws that secure it
to
&gt; the roof.  Three of the screws are on the inside of the luggage area at
the
&gt; rear.
&gt;
&gt; The front is a pain because you have to first remove all the screws that
go
&gt; through the aluminum strips that clamp the tent to the roof.  Then remove
the
&gt; bolts that holds the hinged struts to the roof.  Then remove the bolts
(two
&gt; on each side) that holds the front hinges to the roof.  Get help to
stabilize
&gt; the roof as you remove the hinges and watch where you have your hands.  If
&gt; the roof slips you could seriously injure yourself if your hand is in the
&gt; front hinge.  Wrap everything to the roof and lift off.  Helps if you have
a
&gt; couple of assistants who can lift.
