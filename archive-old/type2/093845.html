Subject: RE: [T2] Troy's engine problem of the day.....Update

your dist isnt seated in all the way pull it back out and try again, or just
push down a bit harderit can only go in one way the bottom of the dist has a
part that sticks out and its a little off center line that up with the very
bottom of the dist shaft on your motor. hope this help , and hope it fixes
the problem, i think it will
later Ian

While looking for any possible sign of stupid mistakes I may have made,
I found that I was actually able to rotate the rotor by hand in either
direction.  So is it not grabbing down at the bottom of the shaft?  Or
is it supposed to do that?  Thanks.
