That's a great tidbit!  So say we have a heater that puts out 10,000 BTU's/hr.  You have 9 hrs/gallon, or about 24 hours on a typical 3 gallon tank.  That's three nights, maybe a couple more if it's not on full blast.

This low capacity is why I decided to go with a gas heater rather than propane.  A gas heater takes about a gallon a night, and with a couple of spare gas cans, you could take an extended trip in a cold place without having to worry about running out.  Plus, when you do run out, how far do you have to drive to get propane?  What if you're in Alaska or Canada?  You can get gas just about anywhere but propane is a little more difficult.

Only problem with the gas heater is that it makes it difficult to compute fuel mileage since it draws from the same tank.
