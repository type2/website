&gt;  OK GUYS,    Keep it up and I will have to bring my
&gt; chopped loaf 454 mid engin with flameing crome pipes
&gt; out both sides. How many buses have you seen that can
&gt; pull the wheels off the ground at 3000rpm. Rat fink
&gt; lives again.     Wayne

Alright, that does it.  I'm going to replace my bus heat exchangers with 914 
heat exchangers (remember the motor is mount backwards in a 914) and straight 
pipes.  That way the pipes will exit forward so they'll come out in FRONT of my 
tires.  Then I'll put a couple of really nice chrome tips the size of coffee 
cans on the ends of them.  That's gotta be good for at least another 50 horse 
power :)
