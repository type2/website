&gt; $400 could bring -- Heated seats, propane furnace,
&gt; killer tunes,  

OK, I'm ready for someone out there to give me hints
on the fabled &quot;propane heater&quot;. Are these anything
like the Ebersprachers (in other words, are they built
in or just freestanding)? Are they auto-specific or
the same as what, say, a contractor might use on a
jobsite for heat? And finally, where do you get one? Thanks!
