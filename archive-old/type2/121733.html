Subject: Re: [T2] bottom cooling housing flaps

&gt;I don't have the little flappers, and I understand that you 
&gt;probably don't need them if you don't have or use the blower 
&gt;(I live in Sand Diego). I guess it wouldn't really hurt to run 
&gt;the blower without them; I just don't think you'd get any more 
&gt;airflow than with just the main cooling fan.

The flappers are there so that when you turn your motor off the hot air in
the heat exchangers won't rise back up into your engine compartment.  I
haven't tested to see, but I would be willing to bet that even at idle those
flaps are open whether or not you're using the aux heat blower.  If you
don't have the flappers (or the covers for the channels), I'd recommend
getting them - Joe at Busted Bus probably has stacks of them.
