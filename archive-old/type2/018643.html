&gt; I have checked the archives some but had some trouble so please forgive me
&gt; if this is there and I missed it
&gt; 
&gt; I recently replaced the Transmission in my 72 bus due to a broken case.
&gt; While the motor was out I purchased a set of rebuilt carbs and installed
&gt; them at the same time.  Other than the new carbs and a new set of plugs and
&gt; plug wires the motor went back in the bus just as it had come out.  I did
&gt; not mess with the timing etc. The bus ran great before the  transmission
&gt; replacement.
&gt; 
&gt; Now I can not get  the motor to idle at the recommended 900 RPM.  When I
&gt; first installed the carbs  it would not idle below about 1500 RPM it would
&gt; die if I tried to go any lower.  I read extensively from Muir and Chilton
&gt; and finally managed to get it lowered some but still runs at about 1000 RPM
&gt; and very rough.
&gt; 
&gt; I have a carb balancing tool and have a handle on how to use that (I think)
&gt; but  the first step in the process is to get it to idle close to 900 RPM
&gt; Also to time the motor requires about the same RPM
&gt; 
&gt; To compound the problem I only get a few hours at a time to work on this. I
&gt; finally had it near  adjusted once then had to shut it down When I returned
&gt; the next day it would not even run at all suggesting the choke adjustment
&gt; is munged up.
&gt; 
&gt; One more thing to throw into the Mix.  As mentioned Weasr is a 72 bus,  the
&gt; carbs are off something later and did  include a  later style linkage, air
&gt; cleaner and manifolds.  I used these  parts from my 72 instead of the new
&gt; parts .  Could this cause any problems?
Shannon:
There may be some incompatibility in the mixed up parts. I don't know
whether or not it would cause the problems you're experiencing.
72's used a rubber o-ring at the top of the carbs, 73&amp;74 used a square
sectioned round gasket. I don't know if you can effect a seal by mixing
parts. Maybe you'll need to use the 73-74 air cleaner with the later
carbs. The dry type air cleaner may give slightly better performance at
the expense of less filtration. It's no worse filtration than any other
modern car, however.
Are you sure you've got 12v. to each idle solenoid? Then try exchanging
the solenoids with your old ones. That's where I'd start.
