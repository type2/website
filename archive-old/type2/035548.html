Subject: Re: VDO cyl head temp gauge: where to run sender wire?

Victor,
My CHT gauge is mounted where the clock is suppossed to go.  I routed the wire
down through the front of the bus and to the outside through the whole where
the heater cable runs.  I used the wire that came with the gauge and carefully
routed it to the engine, trying to keep it from being exposed to the elements
too much.  It took a while but the wire was just long enough to reach the
sender which is attached to spark plug # 3.  If it had been 1 inch shorter it
wouldn't have been long enough.  I think the wire will be ok for many years to
come.  On afterthought, I wish I had run four wires to the rear and wrapped
them in black tape.  Three wires for three different future gauges and black
tape for added protection.

&gt; I've tried several different routes *inside* my 74 camper, each one leaving
&gt; me about 2-3 ft. short. I suspect that I need to go outside the bus from the
&gt; front, along the bottom outside, then through the engine tin. But if I do
&gt; this, will I need to find some sort of insulation to wrap around the two
&gt; wires to protect them?
&gt;
&gt; The archives indicate that I shouldn't lengthen the wire because it will
&gt; affect the readings.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
