Subject: Getting an out-of-state bus home?

Simple question,

If you buy a bus out of state how do you get it home short of begging 
a friend with a vehicle capable of towing a car trailer to drive you way out 
there, rent a car trailer, and then tow the bus-on-trailer combo back home? 

Have read of fellow listees who used Greyhound or AMTRACK to get to where 
their dream westy, splitie, or whatever was and then drove their acquisition 
home. How did you do it? 

Insurance (no-fault in Connecticut) shouldn't be a problem but what about the 
plates? Here in Connnecticut you have to have the title to get temporary 
plates. I think we all have driven a car without plates or not exactly the 
correct plates a block or two but doing this across a state or two to me 
seems a bad gamble. FYI in Connecticut you have to tow unregistered vehicles 
with all four wheels off the ground so you can't use one of those front axle 
tow trailers with an unregistered or plated vehicle.

'74 Bug - tow a bus - you've got to be kidding
'78 Pinto Wagon - has a hard enough time getting itself going
'82 Vanagon - a bit too tired to make some of the hills solo
'71 &amp; '75 Vespas - interesting mental picture there.
