i spent time cleaning the points plates. they were indeed rusted stuck. now
they are &quot;as smooth as chocolate&quot;, but the advance vacuum cannister still
doesn't move the bar which moves the plates when i toke on its vac
hose...installed on the side of the dizzy or not. otherwise, the plates
move well by hand.

listees mentioned that a new vac can is in order if the stream of air i
pull doesn't move the bar at all. makes sense; but what if i toke and get
still no play on that bar. feel like a straw being pinched closed at the
bottom. new vac cannister....?
