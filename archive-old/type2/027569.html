Hi everybody. This 70 Westy I bought to get some parts for my 69 came with a 
tent. Nice shape, very clean. I put it together this morning and it only has 
9 of the 10 longer male/female ended gold poles. So, I only have one of the 
two pieces to go from the front to back side along the top center of the 
tent.

Does anyone have a pieced tent I can get this piece from? Or, has anyone 
found a suitable replacement for this piece? Copper tubing? EMT conduit?


Also: a few of the rubber loop cords which hold the top of the tent to the 
framework are missing. Are there replacements for these? I've seen mini 
bungee cords which I think might do the trick, but repop or OEM styles might 
be best.

Thanks
Jason
