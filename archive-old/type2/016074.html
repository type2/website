Jack, 
Are you talking a Type1 engine?

My Type1 1970-1979 Bently has pictures ... Engine Section page 43.

It also says:  &quot;The deflector plate must be installed on the crankcase so
that the louvers face downward with the slightly longer end of the central
louver to the rear&quot;.

Does this answer what you want?

I put up my very terse and incomplete Index for this book:
http://www.i405_dot_com/vw/Book/ &lt;-- anyone want to pitch in to help?  I started
with the Type1 book, as it is likely best for engine stuff (like this
generator stand).

I will be installing a new stand on my new engine tonight, I'll take a
picture if the description isn't clear enough.

Hope this hasn't been beaten to death, but here goes:

It concerns the oil deflector plate which fits under the generator support.
My reading of Bentley says the following:

1.  the vanes go down into the block.

2.  standing at the rear of the engine on the left hand side near cylinders
#3 &amp; 4, one can see through the openings of the vanes.  Then, standing at
the rear on the right hand side:  one cannot.

Does this jibe with everyones' understanding?
