Subject: Re: [T2] deluxe colors

&gt; Senegal red bottom and was all black interior originally.
&gt; Mind you Australian Deluxe's never had the two tone interiors that other
&gt; countries had, just some chrome stripes.

all black interior?
are you talking about the upholstery and panels?
what color are the inner doors and around the kick and windsheild?
this is the inner color and I dont think it will be black.
Kombis are painted primer in the cargo area.
