&gt; Also, he hasn't said it's a Westfalia, which is what i want. he's just said
&gt; it's a camper with a stove, sink and propane heater. I've asked him to let
&gt; me know if it's a westy or not, but while i'm waiting for the response, i
&gt; was wondering - were there other camper conversions being done to '78
&gt; buses, besides custom homemade jobs?
