Subject: Re: [T2] My Kid's New 74 Bus-seat belt safety

We (in NJ) bought a 75 bus for our daughter who has been driving since
Dec. - the already posted suggestions are good-in a NJ bus, check the
front beam carefully.  Also grease the wheel bearings if you don't have
a history on the last time.  I have seen little mentioned of SAFE seat
belts- make sure you inspect the stitching and potential nylon dry rot. 
Later vanagon self-adjusting seat belts fit easily in the front.  My
sister in law is a doctor and says that if your son is a new driver,
remember the law about one one non-related passenger the first year! 
Also, the rear belts are NOT safe if lap only, (she's seen the internal
damage these can cause) -and you can be sued if the passenger is under
18 and hurt by a lap belt. Adult passengers should agree to use the lap
only belts and assume the risk.Since she wants to turn the middle seat
into a rear facing seat so a table can be inserted between the 2, I plan
to gang up shoulder belts on the same attachment points as the front
seats.  If you keep the middle seat as is, one shoulder belt can be
fastened to the wall between the rear driver side windows, but it'd
require welding in an attachment point.  The rear seats had stock
attachment points under the rear windows, but I think it's in later
(76?) busses.  I'd think a shoulder belt could be attached to the
engineroofdeck behind the rear seat.  Her's folds and is now a bed.
