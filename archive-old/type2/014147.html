Subject: Re: [T2] Mountain passes in NC vs Sierra Nevada...



&gt; ...or my regular route for backbacking: leave Visalia, CA (300'), arrive at
&gt; Mineral King Valley roads end, (7800') after about 4 hours on the road.
&gt; Ahhh, the Sierra Nevada...

Yes, not that you mention it on my mini-road-trip this summer we went from the railroad museum in Sacramento (elevation 30) to Echo 
Summit (7382) in about 2 hours and 90 miles.  The elevation change is gradual on US50, though, so it didn't seem like all that much of a 
climb.  The drop down into the Tahoe basin was much quicker, as was the drop from Tahoe to Carson City.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Volks,
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2 weeks ago I conquered Old Fort Mountain on I-40 in NC in my 81
&gt; &gt; &gt; vanagon............looked for a t-shirt stand at the top and definitely
&gt; felt
&gt; &gt; &gt; like some sort of gold star should now be worn on my cap!  Took at at 45
&gt; MPH
&gt; &gt; &gt; in 3rd gear...........7 mile 6 % grade.............
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I thought Saluda grade was bad on I-26 ( about a 3 mile 6 % grade) but
&gt; Old
&gt; &gt; &gt; Fort puts it to shame!!!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; We've got to get you out to the Left Coast where you can climb some real
&gt; mountains!  How about US 395 between Bishop and Carson
&gt; &gt; City in the Sierras?  Start at Bishop, elevation 4100 feet.  In the next
&gt; 15 miles, climb to Sherwin Summit (7000).  About 30 miles later you
&gt; &gt; get to Deadman Summit (8041).  30 more miles gets you to Conway Summit
&gt; (8138) and another 20 to Devil's Gate Summit (7519).  From
&gt; &gt; there you drop into Gardnerville at 4700 feet.  Typically, my stock 1600DP
&gt; bus (low compression Mexican engine) will maintain 30-35MPH
&gt; &gt; on the 6%+ grades on this route.  With the thin air, I doubt that it's
&gt; making much more than 30HP.  The scenery is so pretty that the slow
&gt; &gt; speeds aren't a bother.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Another route for hill-climbers is from Badwater (280 feet _below_ sea
&gt; level) to Emigrant Pass (5318 feet) in Death Valley.  This route is
&gt; &gt; about 50 miles and the temperatures can be a tad warm.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I still think that the worst climb I've done is the western approach to
&gt; Jerome.  That road is literally carved out of a cliff.
&gt; &gt;
