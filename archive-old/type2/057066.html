Subject: dizzy o ring/pushrod tube seal swap 76-  2.0  hd lifters
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

oh dear oh dear. my silly local vw store put my dizzy o ring (009) in the same
bag with my pushrod tube seals (both ends). even sillier me didnt realize this
and i think i used the dizzy seal on a pushrod tube (small end). now, you guys
that have changed these seals. are they about the same size? i guess rather
than pull it all apart again, ill wait till i start it up and see if oil leaks
out all over the place, what a pain........

opinions please,    love, silly marty :)  72 westy (among many others)
