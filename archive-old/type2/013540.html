X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL - S


Expanding, there is a new server and it is a helluva nice one, too. 
Raistrick is building the OS this week, then it is off to Seattle to be 
be plugged into the rack.

Steve Dolan had previously bought a couple 20-gig drives for us to use 
(Seagate drives, not short-life crap from Circuit City). This let us get 
into the new server for a really outstanding price below $1K. For those 
who care about this propellor-head stuff, it is a 1-U rackmount case 
with a PIII-733, ASUS motherboard and half a gig of RAM. Free shipping, 
three year parts and lifetime labor warranty. We did a lot of research 
over this and we're confident we got the best deal out there, by a 
substantial margin.

Now: we have nine months' worth of bandwidth in the bank. This is the 
money it costs to bring you the lists and the website each month. We 
need to get from nine months to one year. Then we can shut up and quit 
harping.

Procrastinators: You've been meaning to send your donation but haven't 
got around to it. Please DO IT MONDAY. Let's get this thing sewn up so 
we can stop talking about it. Either mail a check or use PayPal. Let's 
get enough for 12 months of the best VW Bus advice on the entire 
internet.
