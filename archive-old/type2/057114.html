Subject: Sink on the 74 Westy

OK,
I just bought my first bus 2 weeks ago.  I have yet to figure out how to
make the sink work, mostly because I'm not sure what I'm looking for.  To
the right of the faucet, there's a small black plastic knob that can be
pulled up and pushed down.  I'm assuming that this at least used to be the
on-off switch for the pump.  However, right now it appears to be doing
nothing.  So, my question(s) is (are) a) Is this little knob indeed the
switch for the pump? B) if so, how do I get it to work?
