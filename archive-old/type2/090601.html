Subject: sportsmobile owner question

Alright all you (yes all 3) of you sportsmobile top owner. I now have
the top installed on my 79. but what is puzzling me is the elastic
cords that drop down on the outside of the canvas. 

Apparently there are 2 styles of the tops. One where the support bars
are located on the outside of the canvas &amp; the other where the support
bars are located inboard of the canvas. I have the latter. There are
several pieces of elastic which (in a former life) help to tuck in the
canvas when dropping the top. What I can't figure out is why there are
2 different cords dropping from each spot? These might just be a PO
being lazy, but I was hoping that a few sportsmobile top owners could
verify any of my theories. TIA
