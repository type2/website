Subject: Re: [T2] Push Rod Tube Removal

No Quarter sends:

&gt; You do NOT have to pull the heads on a T1 engine to remove the pushrod
&gt; tubes.  To put new STOCK ones on you do.  But you can remove the valve
&gt; cover, rocker shaft, and pushrods then take the pliers and proceed to
&gt; destroy your existing tubes to get them out.  You'll be forced to replace
&gt; them with spring loaded or double-nut tubes if you aren't going to pull
&gt; the head which are inferior to the stock tubes but will work in a pinch.

The best T1 pushrod tubes on the market, IMO, are the 4340 seamless chromoly
tube. They cost $4 each and they aren't collapsible. They also won't leak
unless you drill holes in them.
