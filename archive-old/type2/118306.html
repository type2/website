Hi Chris,

I don't post often but I think I can help you out on this one.  I just
used this fellow out of Rapid City to bring my 67 21 window to me and he
did a great job, good communication and a fair price.  I will say that
his ethnono-political outlook clashed somewhat with mine but if you can
look past stuff like that (I wasn't shopping for a best freind!) than I
would recommend him.

Tell him Bill Harris in Mt Pleasant UT sent you.

He hauled for me about 1100 miles for $800-850 a few months ago.  Let me
know how it works out.

Hi- can anyone offer me advice (recommend) an auto transport company for
my 73 bus? I need to transport from the midwest to the northeast and am
having trouble finding a reputable company on the web. Thanks- Chris
