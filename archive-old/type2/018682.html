I Just replaced the front brakes on my 73 Hanover (Blue Toaster)
Machined the rotors new pads et. after a few weeks I began to get a
horrible squeal from the brakes when applied lightly going away when
heavy pressure is applied. I replaced the pads with OEM replacement
parts it was ok for a few weeks then it returned any suggestions?
