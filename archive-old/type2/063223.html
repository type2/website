Subject: pedal seals in '66

I've got a lot of draft coming up thru the holes around my pedals, and
I'm a little tired of seeing the road thru the floor...especially with 
fall happening and all.

I _think_ I've got the proper seals/boots for the pedals, but they don't 
appear to work, they certainly don't stay on the floor, but ride up the 
pedal shaft where they do no good.

Could some kind sole explain to me how these are supposed to work?  Does
one have to lubricate the pedal shaft?

Thanks for any info,
...Markus
