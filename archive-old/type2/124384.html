Subject: RE: [T2] starting and warm up

I usually will let it sit and warm for a minimum of a minute, sometimes
longer(usually 1 song on the radio).  I figured with a flat 4 design, all
the oil is basically there for all cylinders, unlike some of the V
configurations (V6,V8,V12) which need to splash some of that slick stuff
about on the inside of the case for a bit before everything has been pulled
up and circulated from where it settled the night before when it was parked.
I'm more concerned with the motor evenly warm on a cool day, than just
starting it and driving it cold; which may in turn add additional stress to
the metalurgy.  I usually err on the side of caution.  So far so good at any
rate..

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; When I start my 2.L FI westy it usually starts up in a couple seconds.
&gt; But there are times when it is slower; I usually give it a bit of gas.
&gt; Is this a bad idea? Then how long is it good to let it warm up? Is it
&gt; bad if you let it warm up too long? Just curious.
&gt;
&gt; Peace
&gt;
&gt; Meg
