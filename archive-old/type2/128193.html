Subject: [T2]I probably should have listened to my friend.

So I'm driving down the parkway in my 78 when all of
the sudden, it sounds like the engine is starting to
slow down.  Little by little, it would decrease in
speed and eventually it just stopped.  The oil light
was on.  Right before we got on the parkway, my friend
said I should get oil, cause the engine could cease up
if I don't.  I didn't think I had time for it.  So
now, whenever I try to start it, it sounds like the
engine is trying to start but it can't get anywhere,
like it's not even turning over, but it sounds like
it's trying to.  Have my worst fears come true, has
the engine ceased up???? I hope not,  but if it has I
have another engine I could probably use.   Give it to
me straight doc, I want the truth.

-Rob
