Might be as simple as the cable vibrating about.

The fact that it goes away when you press on the clutch might be a good
sign.  Does it go away when you push lightly on the pedal or do you have
to disengage the clutch (push the pedal most of the way down) before it
goes away?  If a little push silences it it might be the cable (readjust)
or the throwout fork or bearing (remove engine and replace fork or
bearing).

If you have to push the pedal all the way down to silence the noise,
it means that it is something rotating in the transmission making the
noise, but you don't want to hear that yet.
