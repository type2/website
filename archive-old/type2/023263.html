Subject: the continuing wiper problem
Mime-Version: 1.0

well, first of all, thanks to Mark of Salem Imports that gave me words of 
wisdom last night over this issue.

i ended up taking the motor off.  wow, what a pain?  how tall were the 
germans that designed this?  anyway, with one arm in the gauge console hole 
and one arm in the glove box hole (not to mention the complete lack of 
circulation!), in 2 hours of fumbling around, i managed to take the sucker 
off.  lucky for me, the stereo, glovebox and dash gauges have not been 
installed yet.

so, upon quick inspection, it appears that the center of the plastic gear 
is shreaded.

so what exactly are my options?
         1) buy a new one
         2) buy a used one
         3) spend 3 gruelling hours in a junkyard for one
         4) rebuild my current one

after that decision, how do you get the pin from the wiper arm into the 
&quot;new&quot; motor, when the pin is threaded?  mine just popped off...well, 
because the center of the gear was chewed up.

thanks again.  i'll be inspected soon enough.

Missy:)


P.S. just a strange note...to show you how much i think about this 
project.  i had a dream in between snooze bars this morning that i was 
driving by my bus in someone's car and noticed people IN IT.  i promptly 
made him turn the car around and when we hit a stoplight, i jumped out and 
sprinted across the intersection to the carload of guys that where in the 
vehicle.  unfortunately, my bus had already been driven away by one of the 
scoundrels.  i started banging on the windows as they sped away.

BUT...i caught the license plate.  so, be weary of an old chevy conversion 
van with New Jersey plates: TT0 105.  those guys are trouble!  :)
