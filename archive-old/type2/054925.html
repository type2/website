&gt;also clearly states:  Maximum speed limit 5 mph.  
&gt;
&gt;Well, you can see the problem.  My bus is going twice that, right now, just 
&gt;sitting there at home in its parking spot while I'm here at work.  Despite 
&gt;the 
&gt;owners association's preoccupation with rules it's a pretty nice complex 
&gt;and I'd 
&gt;hate to be forced to move out because of this.
&gt;
&gt;Any advice would be most welcome.

     Well, it has been shown that time moves slower when you move faster. 
With that in mind, seeing as how time is clearly moving slower when 
outside of the bus, due to the bus' relative motion, I expect the Mrs. 
Grundys of the complex may be fooled by the time dilation effect, thereby 
assuming the bus is not moving. Also, it is a well established principle 
that an item in motion tends to stay in motion. Therefore, my hypothesis 
is that your bus, while a 1970 model, is only 29.9899102 years old (a 
rough calculation), because of the time effect and the tendency to remain 
in motion, and therefore exempt from the homeowners association rules 
anyway, since it and they do not exist in the same plane of reality.
