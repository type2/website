Subject: [T2] fuel filter time

Hi Guys
Well, it's time to replace the fuel filters, as I haven't spent any money on
the bus in a few hours. It has two, one little square one before the fuel
pump, and a large round one after the pump. (It's a FI system). As the
little filter operates in a low pressure zone, would a Ryco from Kmart do
the job just as well?
What about the big one? It looks suspiciously like some I've seen on
Japanese cars, also available in the Kmart, or my FLAPS. (BTW,Thanks for the
explanation of that, guys.)

PS Took &quot;Daisy&quot; for the first long run after the engine was replaced (2000k
ago) today. Impressions....cruises quietly at 90kph but doesn't have a lot
of power for passing.
Uses a litre of fuel for every 7.5 kilometers around town, dunno about
highway cycle economy yet.
High idling speed after a long run. Tried spraying under the distributer
plate to lubricate the weights as someone suggested, but that didn't make
much difference.
I stopped half way to remove the front roofack, which I had fitted right on
the absolute front of the gutters to clear the poptop, but the wind noise
was driving me nuts. In future, I'll put it on to carry the kayak, then take
it off again.
