Subject: Help! Stripped screws...

I was trying to remove the doors on my '72 Westy. I got 6 out of 8 of the hex 
head screws loose after soaking in penetrating oil for a few days, but I 
stripped out the head of the top screw on both sides. I was trying to be 
careful - the other screws came loose with a pop, so when these popped, I 
thought, alright! Til I looked and saw the little round hole that use to be a 
hex. (All of the screws were still in, but loosened a 1 turn, then tightened 
back up, so I didn't have the weight of the door on the last screws.) What do 
I do? Am I SOOL? 

TIA
