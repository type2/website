Hi John,

The T4 has a new high volume Melling, so I don't think
it's the pump.  Also I run 20/50 Castrol in it during
the summer, so I doubt it's the oil.

What can you do when you fimd a case bearing seat that
is out of round short of line boring?  Apparently not
very many rebuilders line bore, but then again not too
many commercial rebuilders get good hot idle oil
pressure either.

Rob
