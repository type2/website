Subject: Re: [T2] sticky oil pressure valves

If the relief valve sticks closed (dirty oil, spring tension too high),
then most or all of your pressure is oil trying to get through the
cooler, and it can be quite high when cold.  If it sticks open (weak
spring, dirty oil), you will have a hot engine later and likely low
pressure from both the less viscous oil and the fact that oil needn't go
through the cooler on its way to the bearings.  The &quot;volume control
valve&quot; as I call it at the end of the run to the bearings acts as a dump
valve controlling maximum overall pressure so excess oil isn't spewed
all over the cylinders.  So in a tired engine like mine, it should be
mostly closed when hot but still open when cold.  This sticking open
means low oil pressure when hot; sticking closed means excessive
pressure when hot, and also very high pressure when cold.
