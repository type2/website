          Can't help you with the backing plate, never had mine off, but
wish someone made new ones so I could!  Anyway, don't take the bearing
housing off the spring plate. You have to unbolt the CV joint from the
axle stub, of course, and push the stub out the back. There are either
one or two (depending on year) snap rings to remove to get the bearings
out. It's really a fairly easy job -- replace the bearings, don't just
repack them, they don't cost that much if you get them from RMMW or Bus
Depot.  Some local FLAPS will try to gouge you for them -- another place
to go is to take the old bearings down to a local bearing house, like
Minnesota Bearing, whatever, they're usually pretty reasonable.
