yep,

a respirator when spraying anything is a must IMO.

Personally i like the POR15 brushed... if you have pockmarked metal the
brush tends to cause the por15 to pool in the pits evening things out, i
dont think that would happen as well when spraying.  But i have yet to
spray the regular stuff... but if the metal is all surface rust and no
pits i think spraying would be better definitely...  spraying almost
always tends to give a better coat... (though if you have good brushes and
the right paint you can get it glassy, i think that where cars are
concerned spraying is optimal.)

With the regular por15 i have yet to get a less than perfect finish with
my brush...(unless i let it run, heh)

I have never used it anywhere but under a fender though... i dont think
i'll use it in a visible place, i will go with tried and true there...
replace metal sandblast etc.

i'd love to hear your opinion on the brushing fills pits better thing.. as
you are an expert where autobody is concerned and i am a dilletante!

take care,

Steve
