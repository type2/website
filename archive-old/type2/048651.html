Hi,

We just purchased a 1972 Bus, little rough on paint, and interior...  No
major rust, or leaks.

It's got a recently rebuilt 1982 914 motor, guy we bought it from claims to
be getting 22 mpg.

Heater and defrost work well.

Only major immediate thing to fix, is the rear &quot;sags&quot; about 3-4 inches lower
than the front.

How do we fix that?
