&gt;I have a 74 Westy with an automatic transmission.  I replaced the brake
&gt;servo vacuum hose that runs from the manifold to the servo.  I replaced the
&gt;check valve that is in the line and I also replaced some sort of breather
&gt;which I wonder if it should be there.  This breather is a &quot;T&quot; connection
&gt;that has the two upper legs that go into each end of the vacuum hose and
&gt;then a smaller leg just went out into the open air.  I recall someone
&gt;saying at that time (I won't name names) who said that this is a breather
&gt;for the servo.  It seems to me that this allow more air into the manifolds
&gt;as well as provide less vacuum for the servo.  Thus, my questions:
&gt;
&gt;1.  Should I just plug this and see what difference there is?

Worth a try.

&gt;2.  Does this have something to do with the automatic transmission such as
&gt;providing vacuum to the tranny? (I do have the one vacuum line hooked to
&gt;the tranny and am unaware of any additional vacuum connections).

I would guess it's to do with the tranny.  There is no such device on a
manual shift bus.  The breather for the servo is in front of the servo near
the rubber bellows that the brake rod goes into.  That line is open to the
atmosphere but is not in any way connected to the input vacuum line.
