&gt; I have an in dash cd player mounted in the proper location.  This
&gt; should be powered when i'm driving AND when i'm parked, independant of
&gt; the ingnition switch.  This way I can listen to it while I'm camping,
&gt; instead of having to plug in a portable.
&gt;
&gt;    So, do I hook this radio up to the aux battery only?  Or do I need a
&gt; separate relay or switch for the radio.  It would seem to me that since
&gt; the aux battery only gets a trickle charge from the hella kit, running
&gt; something off of it while driving would defeat the charge.


You will connect the indash to the aux battery (via a fuse).  The rate of
recharge will be slower if you are running the CD player while driving, but
an indash CD player will not draw enough current for that to matter much.
The only time you would have to worry is if you were running, say, a monster
car stereo setup with multiple high-power amps, where the current draw from
the moster system was so high that it exceeded the current going into the
aux battery, in which case it would not recharge properly if you ran the
system while driving.  (In such a case, an AB switch on the monster amps
would be an option.)
