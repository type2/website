&gt; 

Just to add another possibility, I had my bus do this after I
accidentally hooked up two taillight or brakelight wires (some wires
back there anyway) that were not supposed to go together.  Maybe a short
would cause this kind of funk?

&gt; Pat brought up the stuff about how the thing is SUPPOSED to work, 
&gt; but it could be (is in mine, anyway) that the warning light is FUBAR.
&gt; Mine will come on from time to time, and if I tap it, it will go out
&gt; again.  It was designed so that you could press the lamp and it would 
&gt; ground itself, testing the bulb. In mine, the spring is gone, so it 
&gt; just sits there in the socket and vibration will ground it out from 
&gt; time to time.
&gt; 
&gt; If it comes on while braking, that's another story...mine always goes
&gt; out as soon as the brakes are applied.
