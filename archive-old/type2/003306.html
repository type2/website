Hello everyone!!

I have a set of seats from my 82 Westy that I will give away to the first
person who wants it and is willing to come get them. They are not in the
greatest of shape but for for the price I'm asking, what the heck!! I WILL
NOT SHIP THEM. you have to come get them. If not gone by a week from sunday,
they will go into the garbage.

 AND...the Josh Rogers Memorial Campout III is slated for Sept 21-23, 2001.
It will be held at the Turner Falls Campground in Davis, OK.  We had 16
buses there last year and I hope at least 25 show up this year!! Details
will follow a little later on.
