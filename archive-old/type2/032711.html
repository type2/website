Subject: 1976 westy interior and canvas for sale

I have a westy interior out of a 76 westy with the a two burner stove, 
closet, bed and fridge. If anyone is interested in it make me an offer. Maybe 
we can work something out. The bed is the green plaid if you are wondering. I 
am located in northern, iL items would be very bulky and heavy to ship so i 
would prefer someone come get them if they are interested in it. 

I also still have my one window orginal pop-top canvas from the same 76' 
westy for sale. has a small tear that is easliy fix able. 90 bucks which 
includes shipping anywhere.  thanks
