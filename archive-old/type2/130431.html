Subject: Re: [T2] LPG Pressure Regulator leak

Your regulator is shot and the repair is replacement. (In other words, 
there's no fixing what you got.

The replacement regulator is a Marshall 290. Available from just about 
any propane supplier. Locally I get them from Amerigas. About $30.  RV 
suppliers should have them as well.
