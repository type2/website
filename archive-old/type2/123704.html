Subject: RE: [T2] Re:One final question. :) (about starters)

&lt;&lt;   You didn't mention what year your bus is.  From the description of
the solenoid terminals I'd guess a late model baywindow bus.  But in any
case, you can find wiring diagrams at
http://66.34.72.138/wiring/index.html &gt;&gt;

It's just down in the last paragraph. It's a early 1976 with Fuel
injection and a manual tranny. I've already studied that diagram before
I asked the list. The diagrams simply show B as being the starter, a
small cylinder with a wire going into it and a wire coming out of it.
The parts right above it must be for the actuator, but it doesn't show
fine details. :(
