well..yeah yeah its rasdave again :) i know :) time to ban me from the list!
haha!

my employment:
i am 25 yrs old, part owner of family business &amp; make really good money
doing that. on the side i own and operate an independent record label
releasing reggae music. most of my free time involves my music and the
people i know related to the music. i usually can be seen playing soccer
with ziggy (when he's in LA), or backstage with the likes of skelly or wiss
&gt;from israel vibes. i am in san fransisco area alot (4-6 times a year?) on
business but reside near pasadena, CA (home of the Los Angeles Galaxy Major
League Soccer team!). i will talk reggae music or soccer or VW's with
anyone!! haha! i used to own a BMW but got sick of it being broken into. so
i get a BUS instead becuase i have always wanted one since i was a little
youth. i am really laid back person so the BUS just kinda fits me real well.
i love meeting people on any trip i take in the bus wether its driving up
the california coast or just to the market.

hobbies: i like VW's almost as much as i love soccer and reggae music. i
like trading stocks, hiking, camping, running, soccer :), vinyl records,
8-tracks (hey, am i the only one on the list with an 8-track player in my
bus?), i like gardening, alternative healing &lt;--we all know what THAT means
:), and i guess the internet too.

::::BUS CONTENT::::
there are two types of fuel gauges i have seen for my bus (approx 73-79
years). one is a big fuel gauge (with two turn signal lights on the console)
and the other one is smaller (with only one turn signal light). do all of
you know what i am talking about? i am curious as to which one was stock for
a 1974 bus. when i bought my bus almost 4 years ago it came with the smaller
fuel guage which at the time was too small for me to make any sense out of
so i switched it for one in a junk yard with a fuel gauge that was bigger.
well the one i had put in didnt work too well...the fuel needle bobbed all
around and jsut didnt work right. yesterday i went to my junk yard and found
a console with the smaller fuel gauge and hooked it all up and it all works
fine now and i am really happy to see what my fuel level really is!!! so
does anyone know which is stock? which fuel guage was an earlier model?
thanks for any info!

ONE LOVE, rasdave 74 weekender :)
