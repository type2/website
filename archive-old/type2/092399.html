Subject: Re: [T2] sliding door lock problem

to lock my 73, I always had to &quot;click it&quot;...meaning once you close it from
the inside, pull the handle toward the rear of the bus until it clicks.
Then that allows the little button thingy to turn and lock it.  Greg

&gt;Speaking of sliding doors, I am unable to lock or unlock mine from the
&gt;inside, though I can open it from the inside or out, and i can lock it from
&gt;the outside. The little thumb lock on the inside seems frozen, won't move at
&gt;all. This is for a 71 westy. Anybody know if this is repairable, if so how?
&gt;I took it apart right after I got the bus 2 years ago, couldn't figure it
&gt;out, and haven't looked at it since, so I don't remember what it all looked
&gt;like. Any suggestions?
