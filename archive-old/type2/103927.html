Subject: Red &amp; Blue Plastic Heater Levers

Whoo-hoo!

Just pulled the master prototypes for the heater levers.  They need a little
clean up, but they turned out very nice.  I still need to on them to beef up
where I feel that they need it (there's not a whole lot of room to work
with, but every little bit helps).  Then I'll pour production molds from the
masters.

... and I managed, in the process of creating the masters, to break the blue
one!

You know, I don't really know if Giacomo's heater works in the first
place... oh well, at least his dash will look nice. :O)
