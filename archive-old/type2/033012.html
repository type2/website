Subject: Re: Time For a new Transmission.

David,

I put a '76 &quot;091&quot; tranny in my '69 bus, and love the gear ratios in there. I
have a 1915 pushing things, so I can still keep with traffic going up hills,
and yet cruise _at_ 3200rpm at 60mph. The difference in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd gears
with the 4.57 R&amp;P makes city driving much more enjoyable, and the jump to
4th (.88 or is it .89? who knows the number of gears?) is less of a burden
on the engine that the .82 in the old tranny.

Vote 1 for a 091 tranny.

&gt;
&gt; 1) I am correct in looking for transmission to go with the engine and not
&gt; the body?
&gt;
&gt; 2) Who has been satisfied with their rebuild tranny?  If so where did you
&gt; get it?  I do not want to have to do this job more than once.
