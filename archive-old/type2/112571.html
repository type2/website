Subject: 34PICT3 adjustment

Did the Eric &amp; Barb adjustment from the archives and didn't get the desired 
effect. Just got done with tuning up engine valves,plugs,points,timing then I 
decided to do the carb. Did all the steps in the write up and could not get the 
bus to smoothly idle at 900 rpm's. Played with it a little and then started 
over. Everything looked good, choke open etc. Bus idles now at 1000 rpm with a 
little hesitation when driving. Any guesses as to why this is or is it time to 
do the whole drill out the main jet thing as per the Ken's Buggy Barn page?
