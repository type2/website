Subject: 61 Panel Questions, for Gurus...

 
I'm thinking about going to look at this truck. Guy claims 35,000 
certifiable miles. Sounds like the possibility of a show winner. Help me 
out, here:

1. This should be a 36 hp, or a 40?

2. If the bumpers are original they should, or should not, have overriders?

3. Panel van should have basically no interior, right?

4. Can you win any money at shows with a truck like this, or do you guys 
just do it to show off? ;)

5. This is too late for a split-case trans, right?

He's asking $6500. Once the Cruise Director talks some sense 
into me I imagine I'll share its location with the list. Groan.
