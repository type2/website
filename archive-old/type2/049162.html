I have used a vacuum gauge for years in all of my VW's. In my '71 bus I ran
a 1/8&quot; copper line from the brake booster line to the gauge and get no
pulsations. I find it to be one of the most useful gauges for determining
the condition of the engine &quot;innards&quot; such as rings, valves, distributor
timings among a few. Like David says, it's not the most important gauge but
one that gets me the best gas mileage possible for my bus. Also have one in
my oval. TBear
