&gt; Okay NOW I AM REALLY CONFUSED!!!
&gt;
&gt; I was told that the Federal version WAS the California version NOT the
&gt; &quot;other 48 states/canada&quot; version!!!???
&gt;
&gt; I was told that the federal model required more stringant
&gt; emission controls (from inspector).  The tech at RMMW stated that the fed
version
&gt; was made for the strict CA emission controls, hence the cat converter.

The California emissions busses used Cat's from '76 on, the federal
(49-state) version from '79 on.  Most Cal-emissions models used a cat that
was tucked along side the drivers side heat exchanger, resulting in a heat
exchanger and exhaust system that were California-only. The federal '79
model had the cat going left-to-right after the crossover pipe, directly
into the muffler.   However, I have seen some Cal models from '76 on that
had the latter layout, so go figure.  If your '79 bus has the latter layout,
everything you need is still available.  But if your cat is tucked along
side the heater box, the parts are not available.  In both cases, a '79
would have had a cat, as they were federally mandated from '79 on.
