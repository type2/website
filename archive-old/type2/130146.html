Subject: RE: [T2] Re: cool air intake

I think a cool air intake would be money wasted.

Lets think about this. These cold air intake kits are, by and large, for
water pumpers. With a water pumper, air comes through the radiator, gets
hot, and then gets sucked into the carb (or throttle body). A cold air
intake for this engine makes sense.

That type of situation doesn't occur with an aircooled engine.

With an aircooled engine, air comes in and either gets sucked into the
carb (or throttle body) or sucked into the cooling fan. I suppose the
air may get a little warm from blowing around the engine compartment,
but it has to be a lot cooler than first being put through a radiator as
is the case with a water pumper.

Less worried about performance and more about head temps!!!!!!

I would think it shouldn't be that hot in the engine
compartment to really effect the performance.
