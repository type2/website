&gt; I installed a dual Oil Pressure (one terminal for PSI and one for the Oil 
&gt; Idiot light) sender. Haven't wired the PSI side to a gauge yet, but the 
&gt; Idiot light is wired.
&gt; 
&gt; When warm, the idiot light comes on solid at anything less than 1200rpm. I 
&gt; think the new sender need adjusting, because the old sender didn't do that.
&gt; 
&gt; What's the prescribed method for this?

reverse the wires on the sender, mine were indicated backwards, the idiot
light was the guage and the gauge was the idiot light....?
