Subject: starting problems fixed!

hey now,

i dropped my van by sean's the other day so it would have a night to cool down
so he could show me how to do a valve job properly. he checked out my starting
problem. symptoms: wouldn't start, all power would go out, no idiot lights,
no headlights, then would start after about 30 seconds to a minute of the key
being turned. i had checked all connections...they were good. the battery was
good. i toyed around with it several days. the fix was simple and quick! the
metal on the contacts on the starter had oxidized. these were sanded down and
cleaned and now it starts every time!

sometimes it's the simple things....
