Subject: Re: westy fridge

Darryl,

No, I wasn't able to improve its cooling ability. Tried a few things, like
putting it upside down for a couple of days, then upside up and trying
again, or replacing the heating element or even heating that area with a
propane torch (with caution, of course).  Finally I just replaced the
fridge with another used one that was supposedly running and there was some
improvement, but nothing even close to acceptable. And just opening the
fridge once would waste a lot of cool air. Conclusion: I want a top-loaded
icebox, like they have in the '76-'79 non-deluxe westies.

&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;I read your post re: fridges and was wondering if you ever got that thing
&gt;working. If you did, could you tell me how.
&gt;
&gt;thanks
