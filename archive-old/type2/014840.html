Well the piss and moan comment hit a few nerves so I'll recant it in the form it was said and stress again a awesome job being done out there by all the aftermarket suppliers.  And if you think that its easier in Germany to get parts for your V-dubs well....ask the folks at the mail room cause they see all my stuff coming from the states.
