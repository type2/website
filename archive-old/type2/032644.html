My experience with these FWIW: Take some GM heat riser lubricant, and spray
around the openings for the lugs, and where the axle comes through the
hubs.  Then take a LARGE hammer (3-4 pound maul or machinist hammer) and
pound around the perimeter of the hub on the FACE of the hub. It will take
more than tapping to break down the rust. alternate between the lube and
the pounding.  The drum will eventually work loose and you will be able to
pull it off by hand.  As far as the adjusters are concerned, use the same
lubricant and pliers to get the stars to turn, and remove them as assemblies. 
Then use the lube on the threads of the adjusters and pliers to work the
stars along the adj, screws until they loosen up, or buy new ones.
Contact me P-mail if you wish.
