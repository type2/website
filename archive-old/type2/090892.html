Richard,

I believe the size is 8mm.  It is most properly known as a &quot;triple square&quot;
driver and the proper one for the CV joints (and probably for the
alternator adjustment bolt) is K-D tools # 2304 (mine is sitting right
here :)

At the same time...  as with the CV joints, some are triple square, but
some are hex socket head (Allen) bolts.  They are also 8mm and having both
an 8mm triple square and an 8mm Allen socket is very handy.
