Subject: Re: Tranny Fluid Change

Nick:

Considering the age of our busses, it's probably not a bad idea to change
the tranny fluid on our cars regardless of what the book says.  In addition
to getting fresh oil in there, you might learn something about the
condition of the tranny.  In my case it saved my butt.  Last summer I was
getting ready to go on vacation, pulling a sailboat with my '79, so I
thought that I'd change the tranny oil, for good luck I guess.  I had had
the bus for 10 years and I had never changed it.  Anyway, when I pulled the
magnetic drain plug out, several rollers from a bearing came with it.  The
tranny worked and shifted fine, with no noises, but there was definitely
something wrong.  Needless to say, the bus did not make the trip.  Changing
the tranny oil probably saved me from getting stranded a long way from
home.
