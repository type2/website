I just put one in and only had to strain the heater boxes about
3/32&quot;-you can loosen the upipes, loosen heater box to block connections,
make your own drifts from landscape nails and loose fit all before
tightening and hope you don't need new seals all around (-8.
You can also try separated the muffler flange distances using a large
diameter all thread, 2 nuts, big washers,  and two pieces of pipe
beveled enough to stay on the muffler pipes near the flanges- basically
you &quot;spread&quot; the flanges as you tighten up the nuts under the pipes.

&gt; My new muffler is basically a flange to flange model, with an extra
&gt; bit put on, for some reason. I plan to seal that up. However, it is 3/4
&gt; of an inch out .....
