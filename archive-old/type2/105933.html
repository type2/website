Hey Doyt,

&gt;The NO is low, which means you could run the engine 
&gt;hotter, if hotter would help reduce the CO value. Hotter increases &gt;NO and tends to reduce CO, if there is enough oxygen present.

Well, I went to the test with it heated up at freeway speed....

&gt;The EGR recirculates exhaust gases when the throttle is partially &gt;open, and this results in cooler combustion temps, and lower NO &gt;values.

79cal engine has no EGR.

&gt;But the cooler temps also increase CO. So you want to take the &gt;engine in for the test as hot as you can get it.

See above.

&gt;We also suggest a new air filter, to lower 
&gt;restriction of intake air, 

Okay,

&gt;a new oxygen sensor (just to be sure), a tank of 
&gt;oxygenated fuel, 

I'm getting a new 02 sensor, and I filled up with high octane before the test.

&gt;and a fresh catalytic converter if the hydrocarbons are 
&gt;showing up high.

I passed closely on HC, my cat's about 2 years old.

&gt;I wonder if you have an operating thermostat running your cooling &gt;air flaps? I wonder if your engine HAS flaps at all?

Flaps are wired open (110F around here in summer)
No thermostat.

&gt;There are several kinds 
&gt;of additives that reduce smog. An example would be gasoline that is 
&gt;laced with 10% alcohol. The alcohol provides extra oxygen, and the &gt;extra oxygen combines with the CO to produce CO2.

Okay, 10% alchohol, rubbing variety? Isoproply?

&gt;MTBE (methyl-tert-butyl ether) is 
&gt;another such additive, but I think California  already started &gt;phasing MTBE out in 1999, due to safety considerations.

Doesn't taste good in the groundwater.

&gt;You can get the injectors cleaned up by running a few bottles of &gt;Techron through the gas tank, prior to the next test. Then, the day &gt;before the test,

I've run STP injector cleaner recently, just for the heck of it.

&gt;change the oil and the filter.  (The Techron usually results in the 
&gt;oil getting much dirtier.)

Did that too.

&gt;And have in that new air cleaner and oxygen 
&gt;sensor. And if it has an old catalytic converter, replace it if you &gt;can afford one. The generics tend to be less expensive and you can &gt;do it yourself and save the labor.

Mine is welded in, and I don't weld.

&gt;Remember, if you can find a fuel source that has an &quot;10% alcohol &gt;added&quot; label on the pump, load up with it when your tank is close &gt;to empty, and run it for a few days before and during the test.

Won't find that in California, have to do it myself.

&gt;up the injectors with a few bottles of Techron..._dot_usually available &gt;at FLAPS. Then, change the oil and filter the day before the test. &gt;And take the engine in as hot as you can get it and still not &gt;vaporize the oil.

I followed Richard's saga closely as well and printed out most of what you just copied me with.

It's a little different with my 79cal engine and having to deal with the dyno test as well.

thanks for taking the time to post, every piece of info
is appreciated.

Billy
