Sorry about leaving out that important info, It was an old chilton's book
&gt; and it was for an AE motor which was the closest thing to my model.
&gt;
&gt; The distributor is a  0 231 178 009 with the vacuums in the carb plugged
so
&gt; it mechanical advance.It was on the bus when I bought it. also when I got
&gt; the bus, the throttle positioner was disconnected. does that need to be
&gt; hooked up? if so,...how The bus runs o.k. but I'm concerned about it
running
&gt; to lean/hot.
&gt; Any help would be greatly appreciated,
&gt; thanks,
&gt; Al
