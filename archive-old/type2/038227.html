Kim:
    Here is a quickie compression test procedure (I'll even try to be
thorough):
1. Vehicle in neutral with E-brake on and wheels blocked and engine warm
2. Using masking tape and a marker, label the spark plug wire from #1
cylinder with a #1 (repeat for #'s 2,3 &amp;4)
3. Pull the spark plug connector from #1 plug (don't pull on the wire or you
may wreck it) repeat for #'s 2,3 &amp;4
4. Loosen #1 spark plug with socket and three inch extension then twist it
out completely by hand (repeat for #'s 2,3 &amp;4) be sure to set the removed
plugs in numerical order so you know whick cylinder each one came from
5. Insert compression tester into cylinder #1
6. Find a friend
7. Have friend turn engine over for a few seconds (about seven or eight
rotations)
8.   Write down the number diplayed on the tester's scale on a   slip of
paper  with the number of the cylinder next to it
9.   Repeat steps 5-8 for remaining cylinders
10. Replace plugs into correct cylinders and hand tighten them
11. Tighten spalk plugs with with socket wrench until firm (not too tight)
12. Replace spark plug wires onto correct plugs and replace rubber seals
13. Analyze data (I think Muir has a compression analysis section or you
could submit the results to the list for help)

Hope this helps,

P.S. While you've got your plugs out check, clean and re-gap them! You can
also determine the general condition of your engine by their color (tan or
brown is good, black and oily plugs may mean new rings or valves are in
order)

&gt; I've searched to library and can not find step by step compression test
&gt; directions.  Could someone point me there or email me some directions.
The
&gt; carb adjustment for 34pict3 directions are very well written.  Thanks to
who
&gt; ever submitted those.
&gt;
&gt; PS!  I'm looking for a jumpseat and tent for 71 bus.  Please email me if
you
&gt; can help.
&gt;
&gt; Nothin left to do but smile, smile, smile!!
