Subject: Re: [T2] 1970~sliding door inside handle

Try bustedbus_dot_com.  It only cost like $15 used plus s&amp;h. I had a similar 
experience, only that it was some girl
(forgot her name and where she lives)  I gave a ride who broke the handle, 
and I was so mad also... and she
didn't even offer to pay for it... I mean, if you don't know how to open 
it, I'll open it for you...
