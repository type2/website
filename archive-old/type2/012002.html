&gt; do appreciatte his postings- along with the postings from the New 
&gt; York, CT 
&gt; areas! You folks do a great service to us midwest folks!!  I too,

Well, this isn't CT or NY, but my friend told me of a nice 78 Westy for
sale here in NH.
Good condition, not much rust. Rebuilt 2-liter. The guy is asking $3000 i
think, but he's been trying to sell it for 2 years, so the price is
negotiable.
I haven't seen this bus myself, but if anyone is interested i can go take
a look at it for you.
