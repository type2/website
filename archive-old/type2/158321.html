Subject: Re: [T2] Strange &quot;loose bushing low pitched squeal&quot; coming from

&gt;&gt;   I heard sort of
&gt;&gt;a sick bearing &quot;rattle/squeal/warble&quot; coming from around the #3 cyl.
&gt;&gt;It went away after the bus got warmed up but I figured I would pose
&gt;&gt;the question to the list.

&gt; What you need is a mechanic's stethoscope. Just like a doktor's
&gt; except it has a metal probe on the end.

A handy alternative is a large screwdriver. Stick your ear against the
handle and the blade against the suspect area. It's amazing what you can
hear!

Martin.
