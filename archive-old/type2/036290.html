Subject: '72-'74 versus '79 heat exchangers?


&gt; Another one, if one were building a square port head engine to put into a
'72
&gt; or '73 using '79-'83 heads and used the available federal '79 heat
exchangers,
&gt; what engine tin and steel tubes up to the flapper valves work?

I have a pair of 79 Fed boxes. The heat tube holes are round, same as 72-74.

&gt;Would the
&gt; '72/'73 stuff work (the front lower tins and under pushrod tins?)

The tin are the same as 72-74 except 73 left side with the EGR filter coming
off #3 exhaust pipe, the lower front has a hole for the pipe to go thru.
