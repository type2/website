Subject: Producer Gas

I bought 2 books about producer-gas from &quot;Lindsay publications&quot;

There was a thread here a few weeks ago about a VW bug powered
by this gas...

Producer gas is basically smoke.  Smoke is unburned fuel.  A perfect
burn produces no smoke, only heat and CO (carbon monoxide)

Producer gas was developed to run vehicles when gasoline became
scarce during war.

It is an amazing simple system.  The components consist of:

1)fire box (burning coal or wood)
2)filter

Coal or wood is lit to provide heat and CO.  The heat and CO is mixed
with unburned coal.  The heat helps speed a chemical reaction,
and the CO mixes with the C in the charcoal.  &quot;Producer Gas&quot; is
created.

Filters are required to remove dust, ash, and water vapor from the
gas.  Filters listed in the books include : Paper and Cloth element
filters, centrifugal filters, water filters, oil filters

The gas should be cooled before it gets to the engine.  If it is cooled,
it contracts, allowing more gas to enter the cylinder.

The gas is piped into the engines intake manifold.  On a VW you would
drill a hole in the intake manifold (a 1&quot; - 1 1/2&quot; hole).

There are systems of valves which allow gasoline (petrol) or Producer-gas
operation.

Producer gas systems do not produce as much power as gasoline
does.

The equipment required to run a vehicle on producer gas is very
simple.

When we run out of oil we can burn coal and wood to power our VW's
