Subject: Another Valve Question: clearance

After a provious thread on valve clearance, I decided to set mine to .008 as
an experiment.  I don't seem to hear any more noise than before, and it may
be my imagination, but the bus seems a little happier with them that way.

BTW - this was the first time in a while that they were not all tight, even
#3.  I think replacing the fan, which had the center egged out, went a ways
to helping.

Just for reference, 911's, which have similar valve trains, although woth
chain driven DOHC's, use a .004 clearance.  Count your blessings: just
removing the valve covers on a 911 takes longer than an entire VW valve
adjustment - 10 nuts on _each_ of the 4 covers, and the valve gasket kit
costs $25-$30.  Intakes are adjusted from the top, exhausts from the bottom,
and you work in the firing order, not 1-2-3-4 with a reverse crank rotation.
On the flip side, you did a valve adjustment every 10,000 miles.

In other news, I finally figured out why my right high-beam was out: the
dang wire had come out of the plug!  And I finally got the right taillight
working again, too!

Next project:  A rear fog light using a T-III reverse light and early bus
brakelight lense.
