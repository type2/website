Subject: Re: [T2] Porsche 912  Engine Swap

&gt; I have been watching this with some interest since I

&gt; rebuilt will this be a good match for a '79 bus or
&gt; will this also pose the similar concerns surrounding
&gt; the 912 engine?

actually the 914 engine slightly modified is the stock engine in a 79 bus
so it should work fine
