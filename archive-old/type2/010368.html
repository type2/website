Folks,

I have a 1968 Campmobile that I am just finishing up. The sink unit, the
sink in particular, is a white plastic material that has cracked over the
years. Does anyone know where I can find an NOS replacement, or ever a good
repro? Is there a kit to fix this problem?

For all you die-hards out there. I'm just finishing a book called &quot;Small
Wonder&quot; by Walter Henry Nelson. It documents VW's history from DR. Porsche
and Pre-WWII days until the 60's. LOTS of information regarding the design
and engineering aspects of the VW. The DM method seems to be getting a lot
of attention on the list, but when you speak of VW, you should probably
refer to the DM method as the &quot;DR. Porsche&quot; method. Msr. Nordhoff also had
GREAT impact on the manufacture of the VW, while influencing design in the
post war years.

A valuable reference book, for the true VW fanatic.

Regards,

Matt
