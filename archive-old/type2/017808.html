I'm sorry everyone.....the tickets are 75 dollars for both days of the
show and camping...not 150 like I recently stated.  That is at Oswego
County Airport in New York.  Check out www.phish_dot_com or www.phish_dot_org or
www.phish_dot_net and they  have things posted for it...if you
go.._dot_definitely let me know...lets get as many busses there as
possible.!
