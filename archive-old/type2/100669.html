Subject: RE: [T2] CV Boots

&gt; I have to replace the CV Boots on my 72 bus.  Can anyone refer me to a
&gt; site that I can order them from.

www.busdepot_dot_com, of course. :-)  New German CV boot kits (including,
grease, bolts &amp; hardware) are $9.95 each.  Make them part of a $50 order,
and then the 5% listmember discount kicks in. Part #  251 598 201

&gt; I dont know if you have a Autozone  in your area but I picked up
&gt; the whole axle with boots and all for $40.

Yes, but those are remanufactured.  Typically you get a used sandblasted
axle shaft, a Taiwanese CV boot, and a rebuilt CV joint with oversized
bearings.  However, we do have brand new units available (albeit at a higher
price), which are much higher quality. Price is $114 each with listmember
discount. This is a complete axle shaft with joint and boot already
installed. Just bolt it on.  Fits '68-79 except auto trans.  Part # 211 501
203.
