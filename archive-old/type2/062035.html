&gt; I will happily buy one.  Where did you find this item?

It's from the Lifestyle Fascination catalog.  Call 908-364-4448
in New Jersey.  Item #DZZ044, Zapper II 10GHz transmitter,
$69.95.

As Dworkin advises, &quot;this offer void where prohibited&quot;, no
mention of licensing in ad (of course), but VW bus owners are
all law-abiding folk.  Right?
