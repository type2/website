Hi everyone.
    Well I got so depressed telling everyone who was interested in my =
Westy about all the fun that Vdubs are, and I talked myself right out of =
selling her. Yup I'm going to keep my Westy and continue to enjoy her =
like I should. Heck I even decided not to move so I can keep her. I =
thank all of you who have helped me in the past and want to thank you =
again for the help. And on an ending note please pray, chant or do =
whatever it is you choose to do and hope that VW does not produce that =
sad vehicle that they are trying to conjure up-the new 'microbus'. Have =
a great weekend all I'm off to see my dad he just got out of the =
hospital. WWWOOOOOO HHHHOOOOOO!!!!    And yes it will be in my Westy. =
Thanks all. Bye.
