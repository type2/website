Greetings...

I am looking for some names of some 	QUALITY engine rebuilders in the
Seattle area.  I need to have my 1600 dp for my 71 bus rebuilt.  I would
like to do most of the work myself, but as this is my inaugural experience,
I'm a bit naïve concerning the necessary steps and what I can do vs. what
needs to be done in the shop...

Thanks again.

Tom
Seattle
