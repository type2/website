Subject: Re: Junk oil filters

sorry about the low bus content here.

which brands of filters are preferable to Fram?

 no, i DON'T put Fram on the bus, i do use the Mahle filters from BD.
 however, i have been using
the Fram filters on my japanese water-pumper for quite some time now. the
primary reason is that little grip thingy they put on the end - VERY handy,
as on my car the filter is in a very tight spot.

any leads on research where different brands of filters have been tested?
(preferably online)

TIA,
