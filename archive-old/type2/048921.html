Subject: [T2] heater box connecting pipes

I am almost done with the engine replacement in my 79. The PO installed
two makeshift pipes between the heater boxes and the heater hose. I am
missing the pipe that attaches to the heater box and the part where the
cable from the dash connects it must be some type of flap or something.
I need to know if anyone knows where I can find these things? I would
prefer to get new original equiptment if possible . Thanks in advance
