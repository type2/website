I disagree. They're not the easiest drive, but 'totally impractical' is a bit
strong. My '62 bus is stock except for a '66 1500cc engine and I use it, if
not daily, then regularly, as a run-around in very dense city traffic and longer
country drives to visit family &amp; friends every other weekend approx. For me
the major impracticality is that I only ever seem to get a few weeks driving
before I have to do some 2day job or other (which sometimes stretches out
for longer). I'm hoping this will get less as I do each job well (it'll be
easier
next time if there is a next time), and as my skill improves (I'll get it done
faster).
