Subject: Re: [T2] Ignition Switch Replacement - HELP!

Randall,

You seem like a nice reasonable guy so, I'll help you out a little.

First remove your gas lines and throttle from your carbs
Next unbolt the carb and remove the intake manifolds
Now finally place the carb on a hard flat surface and strike as hard as you
can with a 16 lbs. sledge

Seriously, spend the ridiculous price on a new set of 34ict's and go home
happy.

An engine is a careful balance of harmonic integration, with your spitting
on it having no relevant contribution, (personal experience)

before you go down this road there are some other big things you should look
at. (compression, oil pressure, engine noises, that is if it runs at all)
If all are ok then by the carbs set them up, then we can talk about timing.

Enjoy your bus,

-Joe
