&gt; Thnx Gerald, for the sites.  The site describing the f*rd bronco fuel
&gt; pump inertia switch is complete with pics on how it works.  It would
&gt; seem that this type of switch would be the ultimate solution for
&gt; electric fuel pumps in retrofitted busses.  I know there must be a lot
&gt; of these out there because f*rd bronco's rust out badly up here.

Don't forget the $99 switch: install a n/o relay inline with the oil
pressure switch light and use that to trigger the fuel pump using the other
terminals. You have to crank the engine to build a little oil pressure first
but it also shuts off the pump when the engine dies.
