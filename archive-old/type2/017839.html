Hello volks,

With very practical concerns your answer just might could be looking around
for some little shop somewhere and ask if there was anyone willing to try and
building you one.  Heck in some shops there's enough scrap laying around that
a cleaver apprentice type would find an engineering challenge.  Providing
plans and dimensions and allowing for a little creativity,  ya might end up
with something very worth while.

Go for it!  Let the busma come through........

&gt; We have decided to get a roof rack to stow the bulky-light stuff on.
&gt;
&gt; Does anybody have a source for new racks, or a good used one?  We don't
&gt; necessarily need a vintage rack, though it would be nice if the price
&gt; were right.
&gt;
&gt; Thankyou,
