Hi Volks!

The wiring to my rear lights isn't so hot.  Lots of old connectors and
brittle wire going to rotting tail light housings full of rust, muck and
such.  I thought I'd go through and fix it last weekend, but after removing
the tail light units, it's pretty ugly.

I removed the rear bumper and a good chunk of my right side rear engine
compartment just fell away.  The rusted area goes from the metal seam just
behind the rear tire well to the seam at the engine compartment hatch.  The
seams themselves are rusted extensively.  The battery plate/ledge is 90%
gone, the remaining parts look like paper thin Swiss cheese.  The ground
wire from the battery is rust welded to these pitiful remains and I have no
clue why the battery hadn't fallen out of the bus.  You can look into the
engine compartment from the side of the bus.

How difficult is it to replace that rear right area behind the wheel well?
The seams are pretty rusted through so I don't think I can use then as
attachment points and the rust extends beyond the seams a little too.  The
battery tray is gone too with severe rust on its connecting points as well.

Additionally, the wiring isn't long enough to reach the left side tray, so
Russ is in an auto-coma.
I would love to go through and replace all of Russ' wiring, but that seems
time consuming and somewhat daunting.  I've thought about extending the
necessary wires so it can make it to the left side tray, but just hate doing
hack jobs.  

I don't have a soldering iron and most of my connections involve stripping
ends, twisting them together and wrapping the connection in electricians
tape.  I've had NO luck with connectors.  The wire slips out, the pinch
connectors break off, the plastic sleeve always falls off the connection
when you crimp.

Any thoughts?

How much rust is too much rust?
