My '70 Westy has an annoying &quot;clunk&quot; as you turn the steering wheel to =
either side.  I checked all the front end and replaced the steering box =
with no success.  I notice that the sound seems to come from either the =
steering coupler or above in the steering column.  The coupler seemed =
fine when I replaced the steering box but then again I didn't take it =
out and inspect it.  There is also a slight 2 inch play in the steering =
and I have been checking out the front end due to a floating of the =
front while 40+ mph.  Anyone have any suggestions?  Could the clunk and =
the floating be due to the same problem?  Anyone ever had this =
experience before?
Sure would like to make this safe to take my grandson camping this fall. =
 Thanks
