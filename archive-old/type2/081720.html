The pin bore in the base of the shift lever has a small coil spring
whose only function is to make reassembly more difficult.
Remove the pin and clean out the residue of old caked grease
and you will find it, or at least the counterbore in which it resides.

&gt;Whoa!  I don't remember any spring down in the cup when I took mine out to
&gt;grease it!  I wonder if I am missing said spring?
&gt;
&gt;This picture doesn't show it...

&gt;
&gt;But! it also doesn't show the 3 bushings like I have either...

&gt;&gt; &gt;The &quot;protrusion&quot; on the bottom of the shifter is a pin about an inch long
&gt;&gt; &gt;that goes thru the ball.
&gt;&gt; &gt;Remember that the pin has to be all the way forward.
&gt;&gt; &gt;The problem comes if it is at all back thru its hole.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The pin at the base of the shift lever also has another spring to provide tension
&gt;&gt; on the pin itself, which further complicates the reassembly.
&gt;&gt; The lever must be angled past the conical spring with constant tension and
&gt;&gt; fitted to the cup at this angle to complete the assembly in order for the pin to
&gt;&gt; fit the cup with it's other engaging spring.
