Subject: RE: Westy tent sealing &amp; prices at Puyallup

Actually, the &quot;$600.00 tent&quot; that I inspected at the Puyallup meet was a WHITE 
STAG tent for an ASI / RIVIERA camper.  I assume we're referring to the same 
tent, as it was the only one set up, all by itself, in the sell/swap area 
inside the South building of the exhibit complex.

The tent was new and unused, and had a large label sewn to it to the left of 
the main doorway which read:  &quot;Manufactured Exclusively for ASI by White 
Stag&quot;.  This tent wasn't worth even $100.00 when it was new (in 1981, as 
stated on the manufacturer's model and serial number label sewn to the tent), 
and even as a &quot;collectible&quot; isn't worth half the Puyallup asking price.  By 
the way, this was actually a Vanagon tent, but would also fit a type 2.

If you live near a Target store you got a Target ad in last Sunday's paper for 
a Coleman 2-room cabin tent with all the bells and whistles, and twice the 
size of the White Stag tent, for $119.00.  It has a large door/awning flap 
that would easily attach to the rain gutter on a Type 2, so all you'd be 
missing would be a &quot;boot&quot; to connect to the side door opening on the van.  
Outstanding value for money.

If someone wants to pay an absolutely ridiculous price for a 
collectible/antique tent, so they can spend a significant portion of their 
time fretting over mildew and rot prevention to protect their &quot;investment&quot;, 
more power to them.  

If someone wants a tent for serious camping in a real and El Nino 
challenged/impacted world, buy a brand-new tent for a fraction of the price, 
use some of the &quot;savings&quot; to buy a few blue tarps and some bungee cords, rope, 
and tent stakes, and put the balance in the bank to save toward the next 
engine rebuild.
