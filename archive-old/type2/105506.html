Subject: Re: [T2] Where to buy a rebuilt engine near Baltimore

the only guy that built decent engines in the Baltimore area retired about
2 years ago, drive up to Bus Depot it is probably about as good as your
going to get in this area.

&gt; I have just blown a 83 Vanagon air cooled 2 L and am
&gt; wondering if there are any places near here where i
&gt; can pick up a rebuilt one quickly and for a good
&gt; price.  So far, it looks like I may need to drive up
&gt; to Bus Depot to get one since it is the closest I have
&gt; found so far and the best price.  Time is a factor, I
&gt; am at my parents house and need to get back to Denver
&gt; so I need something in a day or two.

what part of Baltimore you in, I have the Blue/white 78 with the canoe on
the roof in the Northeast part of the city
