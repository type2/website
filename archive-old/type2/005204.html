Well after much thought and discussion,  I decided the best thing to do with
the brake problem after installing the new flexible brake hoses on each of
the wheels was to replace the master cylinder.  At this juncture I didn't
care about cost. Thus, I purchased a German OEM master cylinder.  Using my
wife as the pedal pusher, I bleed the brakes and the problem with a fading
brake pedal about one half inch in about a second before regaining the brake
system still occurred. This was Friday night.  On Saturday I couldn't find
any local VW parts stores open. The one that was open in Portland, Oregon
didn't have the wheel cylinders for my Loaf. Taking a chance, I went over to
the local NAPA store and believe it or not, they had the rear wheel
cylinders and brake shoes. Returning home I removed both rear wheel
cylinders and brake shoes and replaced same with the new components.  Got
the wife for the pedal pusher, and the brakes are up and operating find. No
fading or any other problem. Road tests show a nice smooth stop.  For FYI
purposes, during the tear down of the left rear brake, brake shoe, drum, I
found a brown color substance on the drum.  I couldn't scratch it off, but
took 240 sand paper which is very fine and it came right off. I also
inspected the brake shoes on this side and they also had this brown color. I
also noticed that the ends of the shoes were badly chewed up. Taking the
wheel cylinder apart, I found that the rubbers were good, but the cylinders
looked as if they had been rubbing.  I know from pervious experiences with
brake cylinders that there should be some indication of cylinder wear, but
this seamed to be more than normal.  Any way thanks to all of you for the
imputes.  Sorry for the amount of bandwidth.  Next the 02 sensor and idling.
