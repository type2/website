Subject: RE: [T2] Fuel over tranny

There is a vent in the top of the trans. On a '79, it's on the top just
behind the nosecone, ~1/8&quot; diameter. Not likely you got much fuel through
it, though.

&gt; If gas could get inside, then so could water...and it's not gonna happen
&gt; unless you have some other serious tranny problem...like a hole in the
&gt; tranny.

&gt; &gt; I had this fuel leak I told you about. When trying to drain the
&gt; fuel tank, a
&gt;  huge amount of fuel ran over the right side of the tranny. Can
&gt; this do some
&gt; &gt; harm?
