Bill- 
Sorry to hear the bad news. I think it's safe to say, we've all been
there at one point. 
Now it's been a while since I lived up that way, but as I recall there
is a place called 'Always Vdub' or something close to that. I can't
remember the owners name, but he was a nice enough kid. I never let
anyone work on my vehicles, so I don't know how good he is at turning
a wrench, but I've picked his brain and bought decent parts at a fair
price from him, on several occasions. His shop is around the corner
from Andy and Bax. My old roommate had his '72 bus rebuilt at a shop
on the out-skirts of town. And they did what seemed to be a good job.
My roommate is one of those &quot;speed-up to the stop light&quot; kinda guys.
He sold the bus to me after 2 yrs. of his driving, and I drove it for
another 2 yrs., when I sold it it still ran strong. I don't have the
name of the shop, but it is out near the junk yards(Pick-a-part,
etc.), and they have a VW salvage yard of their own (found tons of the
little brackets that hold the middle seat).
Good luck,
  -Kent
