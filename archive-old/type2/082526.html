&gt; &gt; Check!  I have not seen an aftermarket exhaust that will accept a
&gt; &gt; catalytic converter, and you need that to be legal in CA. Unfortunately,
&gt; &gt; for the next two years (until the bus reaches 25 years) you will need a
&gt; &gt; stock system.
&gt;
&gt; No, actually it is 30 years.
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; The 78 will have to wait til 2007......


I should *know* better!  I do know better than to comment on years of
buses I have not owned, I should know better than to comment on buses in
places I do not live :-)  Ah, well, Sherri... Karl lives in CA and I do
not.  He is authoratative.
