Subject: Re: Storing parts...

Re preventing rust on parts: Depends also on temperature- if the parts are
in a garage (or cellar) that gets cold one night and you open the door when
it's warmer and more humid, it's condensation time and a layer of moisture
gets on everything.  I have a garage built into a hill, and it stays much
cooler in there, causing this potential cooling problem-  Then again any
bus left outside showing condensation on the glass/body has this problem
too!  Small parts or things you DON't want greasy can be kept in plastic
bags.  Otherwise, a spray grease is less messy, or a coating of anything
that keeps OXYGEN from the metal.  Greased up wheel bearings should last as
long as in your car if kept covered from dust  ??
