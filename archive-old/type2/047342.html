Subject: [T2] Cleaning out shed

Volks  I finally got her running.   Naming her is the next step.  But now I
have a ton of stuff left over and want to get rid of most of it.  Not
looking to make a killing here but would like to buy some new stuff for her.
Christmas is coming ya know.

Any how I have the following if you are in or willing to drive to Tampabay
(Clearwater).  Smaller stuff can ship as well.

1.  1600 DP in pieces.  Rebuilt heads and new P&amp;C.  All Yours for 150 bucks

2.  1500 SP Whole but stuck.  Likely a spun bearing   100 bucks

3. tranny from my 68  100 bucks

4. 68 push button door handles.  You name the price

5 middle and rear seats from the 68 great shape not perfect but nice.  50
bucks

Of course I will negotiate serious inquiries.  Pmail me.
