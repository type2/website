&gt;perhaps a 78 hydraulic, which would be the better switch? Is cutting the
&gt;input shaft and changing the bellhousing apply for the switch from 74 to
80,
&gt;as it supposedly does for 74 to 76-79....?


I don't follow the engine has nothing to do with it at all.  You simply use
the flywheel and clutch off the vanagon on whichever you would chose.
But...

Well an 1800 would be pretty sorry dragging a Vanagon, give you a power to
weight somewhere in the 1200cc splitty sort of range, even new, I'd give the
1800 about 75k miles in that application.  Now the '78 is essentially the
same engine the Vanagon has, with an unfortunate difference (well the 1800
has the same problem) the heads in buses (except '79) use &quot;round&quot; exhaust
ports with little copper ring gaskets, the Vanagon uses &quot;square&quot; ports with
metal/asbestos gaskets.  So you aren't going to be able to bolt the Vanagon
exhaust, and hence the Vanagon heating system to either bus motor.  Other
than that, physically either will fit fine using all the vanagon cooling
tin, motor mounts, etc.  You will run into needing to use the smaller 8mm
bolts to hold the motor bearer on the block (or just remove the thread
inserts from the Bus block) and would have to live without a dipstick unless
you were feeling daring about drilling a hole for one without rebuilding the
engine, but it would physically work.  The sort of Frankenbus that you might
do just to drive something home, or even to drive it around just a bit
depending on how daring you are, what feelings of karma you get off the
thing (seriously and I don't usually subscribe to that sort of thing), and
how up to date your AAA Plus membership is.  Hell with a little
&quot;engineering&quot; you might even use the Bus fan shroud which would then mate to
Bus heater boxes, block off the electric fan heater feeds and rig something
(silicone/fiberglass flex tube) up to the flapper valves at the back and
have something relatively liveable.  I've not really looked as we did the
reverse conversion recently but using the Bus shroud even the Bus dipstick
might come out just fine if it doesn't hit anything but it would be hard to
acess with the heating blower tubes coming off the alternator and probably
only available from on top anyway.  Until the motor blew OK, remember, its
still a pig of a van.  So would I do it, sure if the 1800 or 2.0 were nearly
new and I had it around for nothing $$ wise, but I'm sort of a fool in these
matters.  Otherwise...
