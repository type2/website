Subject: Re: [T2] Stupid Tool-Box Question

&gt; 	I just wanted to make sure. Will it affect the air flow / cooling of
&gt; my Bus if I decide to put a small tool-box in the space where an auxiliary
&gt; battery might go? I figured I could get one of those heavy duty plastic tool
&gt; boxes about 1.25 feet in width, 1/2 a foot in length and 1/2 a foot in
&gt; height.

as long as the ?? whatever is smaller than the battery that would go there
I doubt it would have much effect, that is also where VW put the gas
heater on some vans.
   
I have twin batteries (both starting batteries, wired parallel) so that
spot doesn't leave me much room but on one side between the battery and
the light I have a qt of oil and on the other side a qt of auto tranny
fluid.
