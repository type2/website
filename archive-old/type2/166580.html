Reply-To: Ryan Miller &lt;rmiller_at_AZTECA.COM&gt;

Ok, starting construction on my house in the next month and this 2.0L
aricooled engine in my garage has got to go! It's totally rebuildable I
think and I've got a bunch of AC parts that go with it since I didn't  
need
it for the subie swap. I'm in SLC. If you want it come get it.
