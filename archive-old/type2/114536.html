Subject: Re: [T2] Question about normal running oil temperature

&gt;He did not say he was missing the thermostat, he said he was 
&gt;missing the thermostat and mechanism. To me that means the flaps 
&gt;are missing, and the engine WILL run very hot without that item. 

Sigh.  This has been covered many many times, but I'll restate it.  

On a type IV motor (which Pedro has), the flaps MUST be in place.  If you
don't want the thermostat hooked up to pull them closed when cold, well,
that's up to you as long as the spring will hold them in the full-open
position.  But the flap on the right-side of the motor (opposite side from
the alternator) is curved in such a way that it forces some of the airflow
over the oil cooler.  Without this flap in place, very little air will blow
across the oil cooler and your oil will get too hot.  Granted, your 3/4 head
may stay a little cooler since it's getting more airflow, but that won't
help you for long when your oil temps get excessive.  

If you don't believe me, have a look at your motor next time it's out of
your bus.  Pull the tin that covers the 3/4 head and replace the fan shroud
WITH the flaps in place.  Move them up and down and look at how the air is
going to be flowing over that curved flap above the oil cooler.

On a type 1 motor, the flaps are more &quot;optional&quot;.  I'm a strong proponent of
having them in place, but from a functional point of view all they do is let
more or less air through depending on the thermostat posistion.
