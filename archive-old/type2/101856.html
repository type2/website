That's a religious argument.  Some don't like it, but I do.  I also chase
the threads every time the plugs are out.  Absolutely keep the anti-sieze
away from the electrodes

IMO, the threads need to be chased every time to prevent carbon buildup.
You can either buy a chaser or make one from an old plug.
