Holly and Chris

&gt;I noticed something the other night while fighting with my Westy lower
&gt;shock bolts.
&gt;
&gt;My rear axle has about 1/8&quot; of in/out play.

If you read my bit about how the rear axle/hub works and the reasons   
behind the nut being so tight, you'll realise that there could be   
something seriously wrong with your bus.

My advice would be:

1. Get a new set of bearings + hub nut and split (cotter) pin.
2. Get a scrap stub axle or better still a complete hub including   
bearings, large circlip etc.
3. Strip the lot out and rebuild using the new bearings and the good   
parts from the salvaged hub bits.
4. Put some new boots on the c.v. while you are at it, inspect and   
repack.

It is a bit of a hassle but better than the whole lot going to the   
fairies.
If the wear continues, the drive shaft will be allowed to wear   
excessively and a new pair of c.v's will be required.

If you need any more info mail me direct
