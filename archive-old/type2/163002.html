Subject: Re: [T2] 78 Bay Max Tow Weight

Dave, I've pulled our overloaded 13&quot; Scamp with our '76 westy for 6 
years now.  The westy is yellow and the Scamp it white, so my 
daughter nicknamed the pair &quot;Big Bird and the egg&quot;.  We have pulled 
the Scamp to Cali from KS and over the continental divide at least a 
half dozen times.  With the westy package, it's all my 2 liter wants 
to handle, but with a stock bus and maybe not adding all the 
&quot;goodies&quot; to the Scamp, you should do pretty well.

Some of the extra weight I have put on my Scamp include hanging a 
heavy steel Buskatiers firepit/BBQ  off the back, installing an AC 
unit, putting a 6 gallon RV water heater under a rear seat and 
modifying the floor and frame for a drop in shower pan.

If someone wanted to duplicate my efforts, I would suggest buying a 
light weight shower tent and a Zodi water heater.  By doing so, you 
will save many, many hours of fabricating and a few hundred dollars. 
I would still recommend the AC unit, you can't believe how nice it 
makes sleeping on hot humid nights.

A word of caution, before towing anything with your bus, put on a 
good hitch and beef up the rear bumper bracket mounting hole, it is 
just sheet metal and will not carry any hitch weight.

&gt;After the recent Every &quot;wet&quot; Bus event ( not complaining cause I
&gt;loved it ), I've decided to get rid of the tent and get a sleepable
&gt;trailer.
