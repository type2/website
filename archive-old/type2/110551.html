Subject: plug wires?

I was thinking about getting some new plug wires for
my bus (77 Westy, 2.0L FI) and when I went to the
FLAPS (carries all Bosch stuff).  He said he could get
me Bosch wires or the OEM wires (I can't remember the
name).

Any thoughts?  Are the Bosch wires good?  What would
the OEM wires be?  

I just want to be sure that these wires seal well at
the engine tin (other than doing their other obvious
job).  My current plug wires are cheap-o crap from
pep-boys that are at least 9 years old.

Thanks,
Mike
