&gt;A bus does not really cost a lot to maintain. But they often cost a lot to 
&gt;refurbish. A lot of people get maintenance costs confused with the cost of 
&gt;repairing the neglect the vehicle suffered at the hands of the previous 
&gt;owner. This is why the first year of bus ownership is always the toughest. 
&gt;I'll go out on a limb and assume that's where you're at.
&gt;
&gt;Investing the bucks to get the bus running right will always pay out 
&gt;eventually. Very few other vehicles can give you the dollar/mile that a 
&gt;bus in good running condition will. The problem is that a lot of people 
&gt;break the bank getting up to the point where it's a good runner. The key 
&gt;to overcoming this is in the selection process, you must be prepared to 
&gt;let one go by if it doesn't meet your needs. Or else be prepared for the 
&gt;extra costs as they come along.
&gt;
&gt;Maybe you don't need another car. Maybe you need different expectations. 
&gt;Set aside a night per week for maintenance, or to study the mechanical 
&gt;processes involved. It's not that hard, and the knowledge will last a lifetime.


Thanks, Greg.  And thanks to the rest of you who sent similar e-mails to 
me.  I will, of course, stick with my bus.  I love her.  And, yes, I am 
sort of in that &quot;first year&quot; period.  When I bought the bus, it had a 
screwed up exhaust system, engine knock, oil leak, bad electrical system, 
etc.   Slowly but surely, I'm taking care of it, but it has just been kind 
of daunting lately.  Tuition and books drained me of my usual bus-funds, so 
it's been stuck in my driveway for the past month while I pay off things 
like car insurance ;)

Out of curiosity, though, has anyone been in a situation like this and had 
to replace most of the major parts of the car (i.e. motor, transmission, 
etc.)?  If so, I'm just wondering both the best way to do this and how much 
it'll end up costing me.  Also, I currently have an 1800cc engine.  Would I 
get a more reliable performance out of a 1600cc or should the 1800 last me 
just as long?

Again, thanks for the feedback, everyone!
