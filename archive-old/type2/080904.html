Subject: Dual Carburetors and  clutches

My AVP engine will be here shortly and I need to decide on my carbs. The =
engine I ordered is a 2000cc with hydraulic lifters, stock.=20

I am considering the Weber 34 ICT and the Weber 40 IDF. The ICT's are =
about $425, the IDF's $610. What does the list think? I have heard some =
say the 34's will starve the 2000 and some say the 40 IDF's are a racing =
carb and shouldn't be considered at all, especially since I do like to =
go traveling and camping in my bus. I considered the Dellorto too, but I =
want new, not used.

I know a lot of you believe in Fuel Injection. I want carbs though.=20

Secondly I need a clutch. The original engine in my 72 bus was a 1700. =
Which clutch would work best with the new 2000 and dual carbs?=20

Thanks for any response!!!
