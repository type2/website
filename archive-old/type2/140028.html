Subject: Re: [T2] Vanagon hydraulic clutch questions &amp; engine install

Hello Tom  You really dont need a pressure bleeder for this just work the 
pluger by hand on the slave cly then bleed whilen holding the plunger up. .  I 
have also found that if you have the wheels off the ground then put the tranny 
in 4th gear and turn thr wheel to get the splines to line up  .   Later and 
have fun  Mark Dearing
