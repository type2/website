Subject: Coos Bay Oregon

I just got back from spending a week+ in and around Coos Bay and the VW bus scene is slim to none up there! I
saw a few buses parked here and there but the total lack of any in the wrecking yards was a disappointment.

I am spoiled with the yards here in Fresno, Calif.

I am contemplating moving there, but it would mean the end of good used parts once I run out of my stash
here......
