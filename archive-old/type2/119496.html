Subject: dellorto 36mm

Just wondering how well, dellorto 36mm on a 2.0l bus engine should run in 
cold cold weather, like Buffalo NY. I have pulled them to check my rebuild from 
the summer. I have been getting popping out the exhaust at idle, so I checked 
by adjusting the mixture screw, all cylinder changed except #2, so I pulled the 
idle jet and it is not plugged, anyone have an idea what to do next, thanks 
for the help, Dylan
