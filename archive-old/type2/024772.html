Subject: Hello everyone...This is long, but please bare with the newbie.
To: volksfix_at_bellsouth_dot_net, type2_at_type2_dot_com

    My name is Claud.  Let me start by saying that I'm really glad to have 
found this list.  It's like having a council of elders.  
    Here is the situation:  Since before I could drive, I've wanted a 
Volkswagen.  I'm now 21 and the dream finally came true about two months ago 
when I bought a '68 bus for $800.  It's in good shape mechanically, and I put 
about 80-100 miles on it a week.  I knew there was a lot of rust (road salt) 
and poor Bondo work on it when I bought it, but the price was too good for me 
to pass up.  After all, it's a westy!  Or so I thought.  It's registered as a 
69, but the chassis # and the door handles say it's a '68.  &quot;Cool,&quot; I 
thought...&quot;first year of the breadloaf westy......hey...wait a minute...the 
Westfalia plate on the bed is stamped 1969...and it has no pop-top.&quot;  Does 
this mean it's not a real westy?  
    Only to add more confusion, I'm getting flack from Mom and Dad.  Like I 
said, it has rust.  The cab floor needs to be replaced.  So does half of the 
back floor.  I got an estament...$400 dollar for labor alone.  &quot;No problem,&quot; 
I thought, &quot;I'll take a welding class and an autobody class next semester at 
the college.  Money saved and knowledge gained.  The flack?  Mom and Dad say, 
&quot;Don't put any money into that thing...you'll never get it back!&quot;  If I do 
all the work, it only needs about $1500...$2000 tops (and I think that's a 
stretch).  Add to this what I paid for it, and the total is $2800.  Will I 
have trouble getting that back?  To tell the truth, I don't plan on ever 
selling it, I just want to appease the 'rents.

Sorry for the length.  Thanks in advance.

1968 Westy (?) in Ca.

BTW, when replying to the list, should I reply to all or just reply to the 
sender of the messege?
