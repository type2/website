Subject: Re: Did I make it to 250lb ft?

My bet is that you did 250 and then some.
Notes on rebuild: I used a berg oil pump and pressure relief cover when I 
rebuilt my '71.  There is an O-ring on the OD of the pump body.  Be sure that 
you don't pinch it when you install the pump.  May cause slight loss of oil 
pressure.  What CR. are you shooting for?  Have you considered doing any head 
work?  How are you planning to seal the base of the cylinders?
