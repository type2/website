Subject: Re: [T2] Upgrading to H4s

&gt; It's dark here when I'm driving home and my headlights aren't very bright.  The library/archives have a few things to say:
&gt;
&gt; - bulbs get old dummy: get new ones.
&gt; - the voltage at the lights may not be at max. anymore and a new ground cable for the lights would make them brigher.
&gt; - Get a H4 upgrade kit (not DOT but what's the good in being legal when you accidentally drive off the road)
&gt; - Upgrade to a relay system so all that juice isn't going through the headlight switch
&gt;
&gt; It seems like the answer is all of the above but what should I do?
&gt;
&gt; Are there reputable H4 kits and ones to stay away from?  I'm a little hesitent to just order an expensive kit by description.

You can't go too far wrong with Bosch, Hella, Marchal, or other quality
European lights.  Beware the cheap 3rd world lights.  They may be good,
bad or indifferent.

Many motorcycles used 7&quot; H4 headlights, even here in the US.  Check
motorcycle dismantlers for the lights.  Don't get BMW lights, as they are
200mm

As for bulbs, stick with the stock 55/55 H4 units.  If you decide to run
&quot;hot&quot; bulbs you will have to upgrade the plugs and wiring as the bulbs get
hotter.  Don't get fancy with the &quot;blue&quot; bulbs unless you want the
attention of John Law.

Do check the voltage at the bulbs and correct any deficiencies.
