Subject: Re: [T2] Blown Front Tranny Seal

Kirk,

There is an &quot;overpressure&quot; hold up there that normally allows air in the
trans to escape as everything warms up.  Having the bus jacked in the rear
while you ran for 20 minutes would cause oil to come out instead of air as
everything warmed up.

No biggie, just refill once you set the bus back down.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; I have a 77 westy that I just installed a rebuilt engine in.
&gt; Following instructions, I ran it at 2000 rpm for 20 minutes after the
&gt; first start, then slowed down the idle and fine tuned the timing.  I
&gt; was feeling pretty proud of myself (having, in the past, done nothing
&gt; more daring than a valve adjustment) when I spied a large puddle of
&gt; oil under the middle of the bus.
&gt; 
&gt; It was about a pint (ok, maybe a cup) of transmission oil, and the
&gt; very front of the transmission is covered with it.  I can't tell for
&gt; sure, but it looks like it came from up high where the shift lever
&gt; enters the tranny.
&gt; 
&gt; I did check the tranny oil level during the engine swap.  It was
&gt; exactly full (just barely weeping out with the upper plug removed) so
&gt; I did not add any oil at all to it.  (I changed it a couple of years
&gt; ago and hadn't done anything to it since.)  I checked it now; I can put
&gt; my finger tip in and down through the top hole without touching oil.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; What did I do to mess this up?  Two thoughts come to mind:
&gt; 
&gt; 1 The bus did sit jacked up for several months before the engine swap.
&gt;   (It took a while to come up with the bread and spare time.)  I know
&gt;   it did not leak during this time as I was under the bus shortly
&gt;   before the start.  Could the front seal have dried out from disuse?
&gt; 
&gt; 2 Tom Wilson's book says to lower the car before first start, but I
&gt;   left my bus jacked up so that I could more easily get under and
&gt;   check for exhaust leaks.  Still, the rear wheels are barely off the
&gt;   ground, and I know it has been on steeper hills than that.  Could
&gt;   a fast idle for a long time at this angle caused the leak?
&gt; 
&gt;   The bus was in neutral during this time, but the wheels did spin
&gt;   very slowly while the engine was running.  I have seen this before
&gt;   and assumed that it was normal.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; How is the front of the transmission sealed?  I scanned through
&gt; several manuals but can't find any mention of a front tranny seal.
&gt; Does the boot do all the sealing?  (Please let it be something easy.)
&gt; 
&gt; Crestfallen but hopeful,
&gt; Kirk
