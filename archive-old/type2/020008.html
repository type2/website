&gt; But about the propane heaters, I remember as a kid, when I would stay at
&gt; grandma's house in the winter, she had these small room heaters that were
&gt; natural gas and would burn over a ceramic face.  This is the same way the
&gt; propane heaters such as the Little Buddy work http://www.mrheater_dot_com/

My Pick up bed camper and my travel trailer both had surface mount &quot;Dometic&quot;
cayalytic propane heaters.

Sold at RV stores.  No problem.  We lived in the trailer for 3 years while I
built our house.  We always leave a window cracked open a bit while sleeping.
If I find an acceptable mounting spot, I will install one in my Westy.  With
the cloth top and louvered windows, I don't think I have an airtight vehicle
anyway.

If the VW camper was not the first RV, then it was certainly close.  It's okay
to shop for parts at an RV store.
