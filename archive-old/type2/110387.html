the hype and price and are fishing in the wizbang market, just like the new 
cheap Bosch oil filters designed to run with the bottom feeders at cheap 
quicky lube prices, &gt;&gt;

It's called 'branding'...And it's the same all across the manufacturing
spectrum. Take a known and respected 'brand name' and slap it on
almost anything. Kohler plumbing products (high end stuff usually,
and well-made) now slap it on the inferior products that the mega-
home stores sell. Klein Tools (electrican's specialty tools), same
story...It goes on...The worst part is the gradual deterioration of
the original product's 'good name' or the realization that the
name has more value than the product. Harley-Davidson, for ex-
ample, makes more money from H-D products than selling H-D's.
