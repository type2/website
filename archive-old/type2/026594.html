Actually, 150 watts can be pretty hot.  Alot of the heat will be dissipated
through the metal of the engine, but if you give it some time, 150 watts
will be enough to warm the oil and engine so that it will start easier on
those cold mornings.  I'm assuming you'll be plugging the heater into a
timer so that it operates at least 20-30 minutes before you start the bus.
Make sure the AC wire leading into the unit is not frayed or damaged in any
way, because the heater won't get as hot, and in a worst case scenario,
could cause 110VAC to be present on the metal portion of the heater, which
would be bad.  That's a problem with only having two prongs on the plug.

A friend has just acquired a VW oil sump heater as part of a stash of bits
and pieces he salvaged.

It's cast aluminum, with a steel extension on the side where the 110V power
cord attaches.  It appears to be identical to the heater pictured in an
article in the July 2000 Hot VWs magazine.

Cast into the circumference of the heating element is the following:


    FIVE STAR MFG. CO. ... CLARKSDALE, MISS ... KAT'S ENGINE HEATER ...
MODEL NO. VW-15 ...
    W-150 ... V-120


We assume &quot;W-150&quot; refers to 150 watts, which is not a lot of heat.  And that
&quot;V-120&quot; refers to the voltage
[it has a standard 2-prong plug, like one would find on an inexpensive
toaster].

Is anyone familiar with this item, particularly with it's functional
effectiveness?  If it is an effective heater it would be placed into service
this winter.

Any idea of it's value?  If it's &quot;priceless&quot; the owner will probably rethink
installing it on an engine :)
