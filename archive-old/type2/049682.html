Hi all,

I think 98% of NEW cars sold in the US are indeed automatics, though as
older cars go away the overall percentage will come in line with that..

As for driver training, here in the US it is laughably easy to get a
drivers license... The written test can be passed by anyone capable of
speech, and the driving test isnt much harder.  No medical requirements
whatsoever save a quick vision test at the license bureau.  How this is
bus related: i have to keep my eyes wide open for the morons who are out
to get me... an SUV spun off the road 100 feet in front of me on my way to
work a week or two ago.

As for being afraid to drive a stickshift bus, if one drives nothing but a
stickshift day in and day out, starting on hills becomes second nature
quicker than one might imagine, But if one has an automatic for a dialy
driver and ones manual shift &quot;precious bus&quot; is relegated to occasional
use, it is likely that proper skills will be slow to come if at all...

So drive a stickshift daily, however you can manage that, until you have
the skills, then they will never go away... but its really hard to get
proficient at it until you have the time in the seat, and that will be a
long time coming if only gained on weekends, road trips, and an
occasional jaunt to the office.

take care,

Steve

p.s. i didnt mention if a standard shift bus has recently become your
daily driver, if thats the case, your problem is already solved, you'll be
driving standard shift like a long haul trucker before you know it :)
