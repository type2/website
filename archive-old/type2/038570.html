Subject: FS in Fresno, Calif.

In todays Fresno Bee:

VW 1971 van, perfect body, $150 --  2 engines, $100 each -- parts, $30 each
559-497-5839

[I have NO idea what $30 parts look like!!]

VW 1976 pop top camper $750    559-323-8742

[this one has been in for 2 weeks now, it started at $950, went to $850, now
$750. It is at a car lot. A friend looked at it and passed on it. All the
interior except the bench seat/bed is missing. Even the front door panels
are gone. You would need a wrecked Westy to use for parts to put it back
together.]

Now you know as much as I do:)
