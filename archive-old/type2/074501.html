&gt;anyway, got it running - spent the first five minutes of break-in (2000 RPM
&gt;for 20 minutes) biting my nails as noxious white smoke billowed out=20
&gt;
&gt;Before i do though i'll need to tune it - so i was wondering what people=
 can
&gt;tell me about a good starting spot for the idle mixture?=20

Sorry to say it Bill, but the time to verify that the mixture and timing
are close is in the first few minutes of idling, BEFORE you run it at 2000
rpm. If you are lean for any reason and/or a little advanced, you can burn
up a new motor in less than 20 minutes. Wipe your brow, Dude. You got away
with it, unless, after you shut it down, it made a bunch of creeking and
snapping and popping sounds as it cooled down.=20

For initial running of a new motor (carburated), I set the timing static 2
to 3=B0 retarded from spec. I verify the fuel bowl in the carb is clean or
rebuild it or at least verify the base settings if it looks serviceable,
and set it a turn rich for starting and the idle up a bit besides. Pull the
coil wire, crank till oil pressure established, then fire it up. Run back,
turn the mixture down a bit, bring the idle to spec, verify dynamic timing,
then adjust mix/idle/mix/idle till I have a half turn rich at spec idle.
Then and only then do I rev it or better, drive it to a middlin' sized hill
and load it moderately to seat the rings. Then back to the shop to lean the
mix a bit for the first 50 to 100 mile service. Then set timing/mix/idle
spec. after changing the oil. Don't do long mountain grades or otherwise
subject it to high strains till you get a thousand miles on it. =20
