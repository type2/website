&gt; I just re-read your post and have a question...  does your tool bolt to
&gt; diagonally opposite studs or to the bottom or top pair?  

Opposite studs and almost rubs the other two.  Gets lots of contact with
the cylinder top. At first I used nuts and spacers on the other two
studs but found it made no difference in the measurements.
