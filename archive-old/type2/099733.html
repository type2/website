Subject: It's going; was Won't Start

Hi Folks,
Thanks for all the suggestions.  I did not do anything special and the bear 
started up.  It ran all day and must have started 6-7 times while running 
errands.  Got me.  I do have a new starter to replace the old one.  Just 
need to get to it.

Joy Thru Air,
