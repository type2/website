I am willing to take a stab in the dark on this one. Is it possible
that the brake line broke, touched the + battery cable creating a ground?
I once dropped a wrench on my battery and it landed across both the +
and - sides. The wrench fried. I got it off quickly but it was hot for
a while. I can imagine if it went unchecked for several minutes it
could have been a big big mess.
So, that is my current theory, which of course is subject to change. :)
