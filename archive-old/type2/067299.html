Subject: heat questions ('74)

I was out looking at my heater hoses today, when I noticed that the tube
that goes up to the defrost is filled with some kind of materail.  It
looks like insulation.  I can't figure out why it is in there.  Should
this area be filled up?  I get really good heat from the vent between the
seats, but hardly anything comes out up front.  I'm guessing it's because
of this filling.  The filling is at the spot where the air is deflected to
either the defrost or lower setting, located behind the master brake
cylinder.

I don't have a gas heater, if that makes a difference.

Thanks,
Craig
