Grrlfren', you are gonna get these guys ORganized!

The AIRS t-shirt is how I found George Lyle at Havasu. He was wearing
one, so I figured he was one of ours -- &quot;I'm Nikki, who the hell are
you?&quot; 

I think a big laminated button, something like 2.5&quot;d with the AIRS bus
on it would be really cool, and it could serve as decoration in the off-season.

I know we're getting into Friday territory here, but that's my .02 worth.

&gt; some kind of highly recognizable logo (like the line drawing of the bus on
&gt; the Type 2 web site) and use that instead of plastering our names to our
&gt; chests...sort of like a brotherhood/sisterhood high sign...&quot;Oh! You're on
&gt; the Type 2/VB/Vanagon list! Hi! I'm ____!&quot;
