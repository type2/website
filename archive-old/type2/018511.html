Hi Gang!

I have decided to try to resurrect the '76 Westy that's been parked in
my back yard here in the Northeast for 7 years.  Before I spend the time
and money to drag it out of its resting spot, I need to identify the
potential &quot;show stopper&quot; rust spots to look for in a '76 Westy.  What I
mean by &quot;show stoppers&quot; are any place in the van's frame, undercarriage,
body or other point that, if rusty enough, would prohibit repair of said
van into a safe operable vehicle.  Any help here is greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

I hope!
