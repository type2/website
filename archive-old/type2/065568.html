Subject: ramp instead of jacks

My driveway is level for about 20 feet then goes down hill for another fifteen.
I built a ramp out of 2 x 10 's which works great.  I drive up to the level
section, put the ramps behind the van, then back up about  8 feet.    The van
sits level with an extra foot of clearance under the engine.  For front end
work, I just back in instead.    Beats the hell out of jacks and jack stands.  I
put a plywood floor under the van and level it when I need to use floor jack to
pull engine....Of course there isn't much to beat a real garage lift and
concrete floor.  John Jensen in Annapolis
