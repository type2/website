Subject: Which engine should I use for my 73 Westy?
Date: Sat, 26 Aug 2000 00:36:45 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I have a 73 Westfalia that I bought with no engine.  Emissions requirements
aren't a concern for it in my state because of the age of the vehicle so I
can use any engine I want.  I was going to find a 2.0 liter for it but
people have been telling me  that I'd be better of to build a 1776 for it
because of the initial cost, reliability and availability of replacement
parts.  If you had a choice between a 1776 and a 2 liter what would you
choose and why?

Thanks,
John
