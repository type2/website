&gt;So a 'loafer, a splitty owner and a vana-goner walk into a bar. The 'loafer
&gt;sidles up to the bar and says...

&quot;Man it's cold out there, I'll have a large coffee.&quot;

The bartender pours a cup of coffee for the loafer.  &quot;What'll you have?&quot; he
says to the splitty owner.

&quot;I'm fffffreezing,&quot; shudders the splitty owner, &quot;I'll hhhave a ppppint of
bbbrandy!&quot;  The bartender slides a bottle over.  

&quot;And what about you?&quot; says the bartender to the vanagoner.

&quot;Oh I'll just have an espresso and a gallon of anti-freeze to go...&quot;
