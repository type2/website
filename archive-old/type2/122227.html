Subject: Re: [T2] Heat: Recirculated Air

Does anybody out there have one of these ducts and the vent grille that they 
would like to sell?  I have everything for the installation but these parts. 
  Anybody else willing to make a reproduction for those of us with a BN4 w/o 
one?  ;^D  Mike?

&gt;seems to be the cleanest location yet!
