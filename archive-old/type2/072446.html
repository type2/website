Does anyone know if the ball joints for a 68 would fit in a 66???  I think they would, but I wanted to check with all of you experts out there, and make sure before I sold something that won't work.  Thanks volks, enjoy your Wed.!!!

Would these fit a 1966??? Seems to me they would. I dont think the front
end changed until 1970.

How much are you lookin to get for them??
