Subject: weber carbs, fuel pump, etc.

Here goes.  I bought a bus (75) w/ a siezed 1800 in it.  It had dual webers 
(ict 34s) on it. They appear to be brand new.  So anyways. i bought a used 
2.0 L from my buddy to replace the 1.8  Put it in, put the webers on  it. 
runs like a champ.  Heres what scares me.  I bought Bob Tomlinson's Weber 
tech manual last week at a vw show.  Seems like a sweet book for those who 
are considering a weber book.  In there he talks about the ICTs being kinda 
like bare-bones webers and doesn't have a lot of good things to say about 
them. He says they're for 1.3,1.5,1.6 L uprights.  Is anyone running these 
carbs on a pancake 2.0L and is this ok??? If so are there any special 
adjustments i need to make???  I haven't syncronized these carbs yet and 
plan to do so tommorrow,  they seem to run awesome in the little driving 
i've done (still no sticker).  I haven't had it at real high rpms yet.  
There was a lot of popping when i first popped 'm on there but adjusting 
them took all of the popping away.  They seem to be fine.  Anyone have 
useful experience?

Part 2-  The fuel Pump.
I have a generic electronic in-line fuel pump hooked up now.  It has nothing 
written on it.  I have no idea what it is/ how much pressure it's putting 
out.  I also do not have a pressure regulator hooked up yet.  I plan to 
replace the pump w/ a rotory pump when i get the bread, but am wondering if 
this is cool for now.  The book says 3.5 to 4.0 psi, i have no clue what i'm 
pumping through now.  What are the consequences for pumping w/ too much 
pressure if this is the case?.
thanx a bunch

Increase the peace
