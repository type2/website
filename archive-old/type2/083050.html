Nah, mannnnnnnnnnnnnnnn.  The mystery macheen
ain't no Vee Dubya.  Whats wrong witcha, anyway. 
Don't you guys know that Ford, Dodge, and
Chevy/GMC made flatnosed vans, which were
sometimes equipped with spare tires out front? 
Besides, the darn mystery machine often broke
down and had steam coming out the engine
compartment.  Engine in the front, remember? 
Shag never worked at the back of the van.  

It's a chevy, like this

 , but the dodge guys claim it too and argue over
the headlights.  Here's an early dodge 
http://www.vannin_dot_com/earlies/dodge/pages/dodge87.htm.
 

The new van for the Scoobie Movie is an GM made
Aussie van that we don't get here.  There was a
whole thread on this on the vannin_dot_com site a
while back.  Good folks over there.  Ya oughta
take a peek every now and again.
