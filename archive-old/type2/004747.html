&gt;1.  how compatable are the 78/79 trannys with the 80/82 vanagons
&gt;
&gt;2.  anyone know a rebuilder, prefer in the mid atlantic area
&gt;
&gt;3.  anyone have a good one sitting in their garage??


I'm putting in all I know, all vanagons use a form of the standard Rabbit
auto tranny for the actual transmission portion attached to their own
Vanagon specific final drive.  I have sucessfully been using a '90 Jetta
tranny portion in my '90 Vanagon for going on 15000 miles, including an
abrupt stupid shift at full power and 50mph into R for a few seconds, which
blew the torque converter seal but apparently did no other damage.  Early
Rabbit boxes are supposed to be lighter in build, less friction plates,
dissasembly showed no difference between this Golf box and the Van box, it
is said that the heavier duty was also used on Audi 5000's.  Late vanagons
add drillings for an oil cooler which the Golf box lacks.  Anyway getting to
the Bus POV, Bently cryptically says that the '78-'79 box is the based on
the Rabbit and says/shows nothing more, I saw one once years ago and recall
it (the tranny section only) appearing the same.  It would be wise to go to
a yard, look at a Golf/Jetta box and if it appears physically identical
(tranny section only again, not the final) try to buy the tranny alone ($100
or so)  There are differences, the oil pan, the location of the
filler/dipstick, and the shafts for selecting range and throttle, but those
parts all fairly easily bolt on and off, and unbolting and swapping the
finals is about $10 in gaskets, o-ring, and time.  All in all if it appears
like it is the same casting for the housing, chances are a good solid
Rabbit, Golf, or Jetta box will bolt in and work fine with straightforward
swapping of parts, and I've know entire Rabbits to sell for $300 with good
auto boxes in place.  I actually think with some bracketing work the entire
Vanagon box would probably fit in even the early bay, and would also not
doubt that the rabbit style box might bolt to the early style final, but as
good vanagon auto boxes aren't all that common, sourcing a cheap rabbit and
doing a little swapping is good sense.

Just some thoughts.  I'm not sure who the initial poster was but I'm in the
midatlantic as well and would take a look at theirs if they are near, and
tell for sure what would work.  I have a Vanagon box for comparison
purposes.
