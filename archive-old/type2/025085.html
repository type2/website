Matt,

The specs for your motor show that it wants: (per Bentley manual)

26 degrees of centrifugal advance AND 12 degrees of vacuum advance.

I'm not an engineer, so ANYONE,     does this imply a total advance setting 
at 3600 rpm of 38 degrees????

Or,    is this total advance only needed during acceleration and load when 
vacuum is sufficient to pull in the extra 12 degrees of advance?

Does this imply that at best you will always be off somewhere in your rpm by 
10 degrees of advance if you run a centrifugal advance only distributor? 
(.009, .050)
