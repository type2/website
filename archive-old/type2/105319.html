Just use sythetic oils from now on, Moly is great, synthetics are better. I
ve used Mobil 15-40 for years in my air cooled motorcycles, and the
difference in shifting ( intergral gearbox) is phenomenal over dino oil. I
probably have over 100K miles on synthetic oil and would never go back.
There is just too big a difference. The old myths of engine leaks, and
higher temps etc. is nonsense too, with synth oil. 
Just my opinions, based on lotsa miles with engines that REALLY see hard use
(no cooling system on inline motorcycle engines, other than the wind when
you're moving.)
