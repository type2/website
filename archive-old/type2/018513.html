         You'll have to pull the distributor out and get those points
out one way or another. Having the points set right is a very basic
primary thing. And they have to be reset (or at least checked) rather
often, like at least every 2000 miles. I used to check my points and
timing and set my valves every 1000 miles when I ran an upright engine.
