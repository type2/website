Subject: Re: [T2] Does your bus stay warm?

Gentlepersons-
                       I cobbled into the space under the front of my 71 a 
Blazer three speed
heater blower. I got it to fit and still replace the front belly pan. With 
this fan and the 
heater tube wrapped in self adhering insulation (from a plumbing supply 
house, used to
insulate pipes, foam on one side, foil on the other), the heater blew enough 
to actually
defrost the windshield. It even got hot, when I sheet metal screwed a wooden 
slat to the
roof reenforcement bar that runs parallel to the backs of the front seats, 
and velcro'd
a heavy, clear plastic sheet (as thick as a convertible window) behind the 
seats. I could 
still see out the back through the plastic, but the heat stayed up front with 
me.
                    Another bus I've seen, that got very warm, had a big 
blower from something or other mounted into the spare tire well. It blew the 
air from inside the bus,
through the heat exchangers (bypassing the engine fan), through a couple of 
heavy alum-
inum tubes. By continuously recycling the air inside the bus, by about ten 
minutes it be-
came very warm throughout the interior.
