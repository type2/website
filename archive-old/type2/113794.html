Subject: Re: [T2] 72 Westy Fuel Pump Rod problems

Mike, my 74 SC (with 1700 CB engine) came with an electric fuel pump and I 
wanted to determine if it had a cam that would run the stock pump.  I took 
the old stock pump off (which wasn't connected to anything).  There was no 
pushrod in the hole.  I inserted my new pushrod, took the center 
distributor wire off, and hit the starter briefly.  When I did that, I was 
able to push the pushrod further into the hole.  A couple of repetitions of 
this and I was able to determine full range of motion of the pushrod.  I 
put my new mechanical fuel pump on, connected the hoses and my 74 SC has 
been happily pumping away ever since.  Greg
