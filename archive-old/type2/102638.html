&gt;Where did you come up with this Bizarre info--???

What bizarre info?  It was all correct.  Both of Scott's posts on this subject have been very informative and useful as a matter of fact.  Thanks for posting, Scott.

&gt;You must be thinking about the econo Wally World mig welder's with the
&gt;flux coating on the wire, so you allegedly don't have to buy a bottle--

If it doesn't have a bottle, it's technically not MIG.  It might be &quot;wire-feed&quot; though.

&gt;The only welding done without gas is Arc welding--

Tell me what this welder is then:

http://tinyurl_dot_com/5e2r

It says &quot;wire feed&quot;, it does not use gas... but it is not an arc welder, is it?  If you say, &quot;it's an arc welder&quot;, then most MIG welders are also arc welders.  

&gt;I have a 300 amp Miller 100% duty cycle-- and I use CO2 -argon every
&gt;day--

Someone give Terry a cookie.
