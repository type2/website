Yeah, I don't think silicone is a good idea.  If you
do a quick web search you can find info about silicone
sealants being used on airplane tanks.  It deteriorates
and clogs up the works.  (Okay, maybe not such a problem
if you only apply it to the outside, but still doesn't
seem like a good long term solution.)

Recently asked about this to a VW junkyard in OK and
they responded saying that it may be possible to seal
the cracks using urethane window sealer.  A little
research shows that there are gasoline resistant urethane
products.  Don't know how hard they are to track down
though.

For the section of hose closer to the tank, I found a
2 foot section that fit at NAPA (~$17.00/foot) and was 
able to muscle it on there.  I think it was for a chevy
pickup fuel filler.  I think that during the struggle,
I opened the cracks in the other part though, so be
gentle.
