&gt; or it would die.  Also had to crack the throttle when warming the thing up.

&gt; the hissing noise changes when you find it.

Vacuum leak, hmmm, maybe that smog out here is eating them away faster

We'll check this out as well,

How did you get the  upright in a '78 westy? (no need to get too
technical--it'd be over my head!  ;-)   )

Thanks, Lauria
