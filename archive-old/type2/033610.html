Subject: RE:  My 914 bus/longish

&gt;My regular Vw mechanic who is over priced and takes a long time to do 
&gt;the work said he'd rather put a 1700 back in so everything would be 
&gt;easier to work on in the future. This makes sense. Although Ive always 
&gt;loved the power of my engine all the time thinking I had a fairly stock 17 
&gt;or 1800. I dont know if I would be happy with a downgrade.

If you don't mind the inconvenience of the centrally located dipstick, I
can't see any reason not to rebuild the motor you have to the same specs.
Why downgrade?  How would putting a 1.7 in there make anything easier to
work on in the future?  All pancake motors are the same to work on - all the
same parts (except for different size P&amp;C and valve sizes), same torque
specs, parts are readily available for all 3 sizes.  Maybe your mechanic has
a buyer for a 914 2.0 and wants to do the switch to make some extra money
for himself??

&gt;To add, Im not sure if the 914 is 2.0 or not. My mech said they all were 
&gt;but avp has 17-1800 914's?

914's, like buses, came with all 3 sizes (1.7, 1.8, 2.0).  Did you find the
engine code on your engine?  The first character(s) identifies what size and
from what vehicle it came.  914 engine codes are as follows:

W   1970-71  1679cc  (1.7 liter)  80 horsepower
EA  1972-73  1679cc  (1.7 liter)  80 HP
GA  1973-74  1971cc  (2.0 liter)  95 HP
EC  1974-76  1795cc  (1.8 liter)  76 HP
GC  1975-76  1971cc  (2.0 liter)  88 HP

Other than the engine code itself, the only outwardly identifying thing
about the 914 2.0 motors is the 3-bolt intakes on the heads (vs. 4-bolt for
all other pancake engine heads).  If that's what you've got then you've got
the highest horsepower, strongest stock type IV motor that VW (or Porsche)
ever made.  It's also the most valuable and most sought-after by the 914
croud.  If it is a 914 2.0 but has 4-bolt heads (they'd be bus 2.0 heads)
then theres really no additional value to the motor and it will be producing
less horsepower

&gt;Does any one have any suggestions as to wich route to take in 
&gt;their experience?
&gt;The 914 rebuild(2.0) or 1700 stock?

I say have the 914 2.0 (if that's really what's in there) rebuilt.  The 914
2.0 pistons have a different shaped top on them to achieve higher
compression and produce more horsepower.  They're also a bit more expensive
to replace ($500/set).  The valves in the heads are also more expensive than
their VW counterparts so if you need head work done, it may cost a little
more.  But the power difference is substantial and you WILL notice a smaller
engine!!

&gt;ALSO...(sorry)   he stated that a 914 is very much like a VW engine 
&gt;except for the heads. THre really isnt much diff. so what would be the 
&gt;advantage to having a 914 2.0 or a VW 2.0?

Horsepower, horsepower, horsepower!!
