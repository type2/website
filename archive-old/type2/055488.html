Subject: '78 vent window questions

Hi all,

Someone told me that the vent wing glass was pressed into the frame
using a special tool.  Has anyone ever had this done?  On one of the
windows I just bought, some PO has taken the glass out and put it back
in with silicone rubber instead of the proper seal.  This looks a mess
with gaps everywhere and just about all the rubber is on one side of the
glass.  I would like to do the job properly - any ideas?
Also, has anyone successfully replaced the top pivot rivet?  If so,
where do you get them and what tool do you need?  I could always use
screws and nyloc nuts but it would be easy for someone to break into my
bus.  Having said that, it took me all of 2 minutes to file the heads
off the old rivets and pop them out - they're only brass (Haynes says
they're too hard to drill out, you need to grind them off, the guy must
have been using a pointed stick).
