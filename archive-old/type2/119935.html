Subject: Exhaust install the right way!? no more leaks....

Howdy Fellers,
 
Some of you know by now that the 1600DP is up on the bench waitng to be inserted into the newly rebuilt transmission under my 69 bus. I have a little time and want to do everything I can (preventetive) at this point. 
 
Before I dropped the engine it was running very well except for a little hesitation and occasional idle problems. A good friend with a good ear for these engines borrowed the bus and was convinced that a vaccum leak was to blame. we plugged all suspects and replaced clamps and hoses to no avail. I also checked the tube btwn the carb and heads and the rubber looks good on the couplers.
 
COULD AN EXHAUST LEAK have the same effect. . I had been running with a broken stud on the block (right below the small metal tube that goes up to the carb which is part of the vaccum system right) and  i am not sure if i installed propper gaskets . I'm thinking of having a machine shop remove the stud.(it's pretty far gone)
 
Q: should i remove all of the studs and replace them with stainless steel?
 
Q: which exhaust gaskets to use at the block? the kit I bought had two for each of the four connections (4 big 4 small). Four gaskets are flat and somewhat flexible and four are rigid with a raised circle on either side. Someone at the parts place said either or. (is this true)
 
Q: Is any gasket seal helpful here or other product ? (specifically)
 
Muchas gracias

anything that can go wrong will go wrong but can be fixed.
