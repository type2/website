&gt; I have some input to the earlier conversation.
&gt; 1) 79-83 bus cali fuel injection - the O2 sensor does not control mixture,
&gt; it only helps with emissions. There is still a head temp sensor greatly
&gt; contributing to the emissions.

Huh?? You need to go back to Automechanics 101!  The O2 sensor helps with
emissions BY controling the mixture. From website
http://et.nmsu_dot_edu/~etti/winter99/manufacturing/long/long.html is a good
writeup called &quot;Sensors, An Intergral Part of Today's Automobile&quot;.
&quot;The oxygen sensor is used to maintain a chemically balanced
(stoichiometric) 14.7:1 air fuel ratio through monitoring the oxygen content
of the exhaust gas. The sensor mounts directly on the exhaust system near
the exhaust manifold. The sensor monitors the oxygen level in the outside
air and compares it to the oxygen level in the exhaust gas. A small portion
of the sensor, mainly it's zirconia tip, is in direct contact with exhaust
gases. The zirconia reacts with the gases and developes a signal voltage
that is sent to a computer that, in-turn, converts the data for use in the
air/fuel delivery system. Depending on the level of oxygen, the fuel/air
mixture is either increased or decreased.&quot;

&gt; 2) By adding the Air/fuel ratio guage and inline potentiometer to the head
&gt; temp sensor, you trick the computer into thinking the engine is cold and
it
&gt; sends more fuel or pulses the injector longer. There is no need to mess
with
&gt; fuel pressure because fuel pressure has nothing to do with rich or lean,
&gt; just maintaining the pulse pressure in the injector.

More mis-information.
If your fuel pressure is low, your fuel quanity output of the injector will
be low. The ECU only sends a pulse to open the injector for a certain amount
of time. It does not know how much fuel FLOWS thru the injector.


&gt; If you want to send
&gt; even more fuel, just step up to a bigger injector as long as it's made by
&gt; bosch. Like say from a 2.3litre ford.
&gt; 3) to flow more air, get rid of the air box and strap a k&amp;n air filter to
&gt; your AFM.

And where do you live? Don't you have emission laws? I assume it's
California since you started this about 79-83 Cal buses. If you get rid of
the air box you lost the EEC valve. This valve controls your evaporative
emissions by purging the charcoal cannister. Your bus is now illegal due to
tampering with the emission controls. You are the leading factor of why we
have to do biannual smog checks. [ If your car fails but all the systems are
working to the best of their ability, you have a maximum $$ limit to try to
get it to pass, if it won't...you can get a waiver. If your car has been
tampered with, there is no cost limit....you have to fix it and get it to
pass. It appears as though the smog check program is a survey to see how
many cars are tampered with and we are paying for it!]
