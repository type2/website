Subject: PDSIT Enrichment/Lean Resistor Q
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hello Fellow V-Dubbers,

    After tearing into my left side carb from my 72 bus, and finding some
manglings performed by the DPO, I  ventured off to the archives to see how
to handle it.  Got a lot of good info, but not exactly what I needed.  A
Little Help?
    The enrichment/lean resistor is missing from it.  The DPO had simply run
some old screws (un-matching threads) into the mounting holes and what
appears to be an air inlet.  The general consensus seems to be that this
little doo-hicky never did much to begin with.... so do I plug these holes
or leave them open?   The center hole (used to have an o-ring seal to the
resistor) connects to the tall air inlet at the top of the carb.  And for
some reason,  I can blow air through the left mounting hole and it comes out
the fuel inlet and the upward slanting tube in the throttle body.   I'm
guessing this will have to be plugged to prevent leaking?
    On to the next mangling....
    For whatever reason, the DPO decided he needed to take a saw and cut off
the mounting for the main Idle cut-off valve on the top/side of the carb.
This leaves just an open hole that also seems connected to the air inlet at
the top, and the mounting hole for the enrichment resistor.  Plug him?   Or
does it matter?   The two other idle cut-off valves are modified to stay
open.
    My initial problem and reason for tearing into the carbs was fuel
leaking into the crankcase.   I figured I'd just rebuild them both since
it's a new bus for me and pretty easy to do.  I'm guessing that one or the
other needle valves was leaking, and I also installed a pressure regulator
to cut down the pressure from an electric fuel pump.  But could these open
holes where there are missing parts be part of the problem?
    And one more....  (I know, I know..... lots of questions for one post,
but I don't post much!)   Is there supposed to be something connected to the
tall air inlet on the top of the carb?   None of my manuals show this, but
it sure looks like some tube from somewhere should connect here.

    Thanks in advance for your help.....
