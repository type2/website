&gt; hello Todd That is the way I have been installing lifters for a long time
&gt; except I just use a long screwdriver to pump the lifters. later  Mark  Dearing


why you guys working so hard, just chucked a piece of pushrod into my
drill press, (don't turn it on) and just use the lever to push the lifter
in the can...lot less work involved.
