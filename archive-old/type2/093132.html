Subject: Re: [T2] Gas Tank


&gt;In my 69 I took that pipe out of the tank, threw away the filter (screen) 
&gt;and cut the pipe down so it was level with bottom of the tank. This keeps 
&gt;the water from sitting on the bottom.

But that slight bit of extra pipe was to block the crud that settles out of 
the gas and the water too.

Probably as long as you change the filter regularly you'll be okay. My 
guess was that this was for the typical car owner/driver that does little 
or no maintenance to their vehicle and which simply throws it away when it 
gets old (and about the time the tank is rusting from the trapped water)....
