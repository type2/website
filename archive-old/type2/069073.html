Subject: Oh No! She Won't fire

Okay... Obi Wan Knobi I need your help!!

Today I went out to start my van and no go. The temp dropped real low
overnight she was running fine yesterday..

She turns over okay... battery is okay... Catches once in awhile but will
not fire all four cylanders and then floods out....major gas dripping out
right side of carb slight gas dripping out of left side..

I noticed some peculiar happenings.. eg. my left hand carb (one with idle
adjust) is completely closed... right hand is completely open.

I have had no problems until now. It was recently tuned a couple months ago.
It ran like a dream yesterday and did not want to start at all today. I have
had no other cold starting problems..

The temp dipped below -18C on the mercury last night.. prior to that the
lowest temp was -12c. 

Any suggestions? Is my intake manifold plugged with ice? When i pulled the
dipstick out this morning their appeared to be ice in the oil.. I noticed
lots of condensation in the oil cap...


I let it sit all day and tried to start it when i got home.. It nearly
started once... made a full fire on all cyclanders and died.

HELP!!!! I want my bus back
Brian
