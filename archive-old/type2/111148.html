Subject: Dumb brake booster vacuum hose connection question.

Hello List,

I am waiting for my brake booster vacuum hose to
arrive and I have a connection question. My bus has a
74 automatic transmission. It also uses manifold
vacuum to opperate. Would it be best to just run a
short length of vacuum line from the tranny and &quot;T&quot; it
into the booster vacuum line? Would this be better
than running the tranny line through the fire wall?
This way, only the thick booster line goes through the
fire wall. I just wanted to make sure before I cut up
that expensive booster line. Any suggestions as to
where I can find the appropraite &quot;T&quot;? L()WES does not
have what I am looking for. Neither does Advance auto
Parts. Thanks!

Regards,
David Kelly
