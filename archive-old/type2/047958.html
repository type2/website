Subject: [T2] My happy little camper

Hi Volks,

Here's a very sweet little bit of Friday fluff: A picture of my dear
little child happily camping in our '78 Westfalia near a little known CA
hotspring. Picture also shows off the debut of my new poptop canvas.

May all your family camping outings be as pleasant.
