Subject: Re:registering out of state vehicles

Hi,

I too live in California and just purchased a '74 Westy. The car is from
Maine. Not originally I'm told. However, I'm still going to have to deal
with registering it here. 
Which means I'll have to do the smog thing. Thankfully, the smog impact
fee that they usually charge for registering out of state vehicles($300)
only applies to vehicles newer than '75. Whew!
The engine will require some work I'm told to become smoggable. The PO
told me. I'm picking up the van this weekend.
I'll keep you posted on the joys of DMV and California.....
