Hey, we hippies were never shiftless and always maintain and repair our
buses. This is is one of the chief reasons why they became along with
beetles vehicles of choice for those in the movement.

&gt; Interesting article, although I am distressed at the inevitable &quot;hippy&quot;
&gt; connotation the Bus always evokes.  My late mother drove Busses through
the
&gt; 1960s to the 1980s, when she was in her youthful prime.  It was not
unusual
&gt; for a real hippie to flash the peace sign at her... But she was a
housewife,
&gt; mother of three, and married to a ship-shape US Navy veteran.  Hippie
&gt; indeed!
&gt;
&gt; (Not to mention that today, no shiftless hippie could possibly afford the
&gt; specialist maintenance required of our beloved &quot;metal boxes&quot;...)
