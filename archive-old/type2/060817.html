&gt; I am trying to identify the common failure items of VW vans.
&gt;
&gt; Example of the items that I have in mind are:
&gt;
&gt;  what other parts have frequent failure on the VW bus?


More common failure items on Loaves...

four-way flasher switch (failure causes turn signals not to work)
fuel line (failure causes bus to burn to the ground)
starter solenoid wiring (failure to install a Bosch WR1 relay kit causes bus
not to start when hot)
air flow meter (groove worn in circuit board causes poor idle and other
running problems)
poor grounds to fuel injection harness (causes any number of fuel injection
problems)
rust under sliding door track (causes door to come off in your hand when
opening it)
rust under windshield (if you see it, there's probably much more you can't
see under the seal)
dropped valve seat (causes severe engine damage; warning sign is valve that
frequently tightens itself)

There are others, but these come to mind offhand.
