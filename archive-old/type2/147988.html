Subject: RE: [T2] Battery light woes

 &gt;&gt;Your battery is well grounded, but what about the alternator/engine?
 &gt;&gt;Check the ground strap at the nose of the trans.

 &gt;Strap check out good.  Took the connections off and wire brushed them any
 &gt;how though

Two thoughts:

Did you clean up the connection on the solenoid where the +ve lead 
from the alternator joins the rest of the wiring? This location is 
somewhat exposed and tends to build up corrosion and crud over time. 
I gained 0.5V (measured at the dash) after doing this.

I know you have a new battery but did you clean up the inside of the 
connectors on the battery leads before installing it?

HTH,

Martin.
