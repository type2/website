&gt;an ohm meter but don't know what ohm setting to use RX1, RX10 OR RX1K.  As you

Don't know anything about air intake sensors as my bus has carbs but if
your're looking to read 200-400 ohms, and you set your meter to X10 then  a
reading of 50 on the scale will be 500 ohms and so on. Just make sure you
zero it first by touching the two meter wires together and adjusting the
knob so you get a full scale deflection reading of zero.
