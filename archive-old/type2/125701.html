Subject: Re: [T2] Fix fogging around edge of windshield

Nothing short of replacing the glass John--

&quot;If I were a Rich man, yada, dada, dada, dada, dada, da--&quot;

The plastic laminate is going bad between the layers of glass---and
milking out.
There is nothing you can do to get rid of it--

Sorry---

TK


Hi all,
            Is there any poor mans way to fix or
decrease the fogging that occurs around older winshields as the layers
separate? I've got the windshield of my wife's '70 bus out, and it's
fogged in to the windshield about 2 inches (5 cm)--and I'm hoping
there's something I could do to at least decrease it.
Thanks,
John
