&gt; Paul, we just purchased the Bridgestone 603V a couple of months ago.  They
&gt; ride very well on the highway &amp; around town. 

I second that assessment .. I have them in load range D on all 4 corners and
are very happy with them; interstate/wind sway has decreased noticeably and
cornering has improved.  Kinda pricey but worth the investment IMHO.
