Subject: [T2] A few questions before I begin....

&gt;1. How important is checking the deck height at TDC

If your piston were too close to the head, wouldn't this be a really good time to find out ?

&gt;2. An article a friend gave me about rebuilding a VW engine suggests fitting
&gt;the distributor drive shaft before putting in the cam and crank
&gt;shafts...why?  Is the procedure to install the distributor drive shaft in
&gt;the Muir book adequate?

Read that article again. It never said to install the dizzy drive before
installing the cam and crank. Maybe it said immediately following.

&gt;3. Anything else that I should make sure not to overlook?

Details are the difference between an engine that runs
and an engine that runs well. Take your time and
remember that every engine build is a learning experience.
Expect to discover a nuance and you will.
