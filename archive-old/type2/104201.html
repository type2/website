Subject: friday content:  Duct Tape

I was wondering if any other bus driver's are having to make the same 
difficult decision...........

I cannot decide if I want to &quot;risk it&quot; and take the roll of duct tape out of 
my bus  and use it in my new Homeland Security Terrorism Protection kit.
