&gt;All, I have some older distant relatives with a VW powered caravan sort of
&gt;thing. The cab is a type2 and the rest is pure caravan park. I havnt seen it
&gt;in a while but I remember the inside was very neatly done. Anyway, it looks
&gt;like they wont need it anymore. Is this a rare thing or some local
&gt;conversion? Whatever, is it worth having as a VW variation, oh yes, it has
&gt;autovilla on the front of the caravan bit.

Barry,

The beast of which you speak is of South African origin.They are a
caravan thingy built on a Transporter Single Cab with the pickup
bed removed and a walk-thru created between cab and caravan.
A small number made their way to Oz as private imports since SA is
also RHD.One has lived near me for many years now and I have been
told by the owner that there is only a handful of them in the country,
maybe 5 or so.Current owner bought it locally a few years back for
(I think) $6000Aus.Certainly their rarity makes it a collectable...

Nice idea but a real bugger in winds to drive.The one I know even has
all matching crockery etc with the manufacturer's name printed on it.
Everything has it's own place to live and all the plates are fastened
down so nothing gets thrown around (especially when it's windy!)

Access to the engine is wonderful.It has a rear access hatch similar
to a Type2 but also,if you remove the rear bed/seat from in the caravan,
you can literally climb into the engine bay.Handy for all those regular
re-builds from pushing all that wind resistace along...;)

Grab it if you can before someone else does!

Cheers,
