Subject: [T2] Distributor Identification


&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt;
&gt; I think I have the wrong distributor in my 74 1800 Dual carb bus. I went
to
&gt; the local parts shop and they werent able to supply me with the parts to
fit.
&gt; Standard 74 Bus Cap and rotor seemed quite different.

&gt; The only thing I could find was at Type2_dot_com and referred it to the
following
&gt; which was a type3 1600 ????

&gt; Any info much appreciated
