Subject: Starting problems--temperature sensor #2?

I'm having starting problems with my 75 bus with a 79
fuel injected engine.  It always takes a few tries
before it will actually start and run.  Here's what
happens:  turn the key, engine cranks and starts and
runs for 3 to 5 seconds, then stops..  Do it again-
same result. Again, and it runs for  3 to 5 seconds.  
Finally, the 4th attempt results in a running engine. 
If it is warm outside, it may continue running after 3
attempts.  If the engine is warm, it will restart and
run on the first try.
I have shop manuals, and decided to run through the
procedures to check the FI system. New points,
condenser, rotor, cap, wires, etc. have no affect.
Everything checked out okay until I got to the part
about checking the temperature sensor #2 (the one on
the head by #3 cylinder).  I find no temp sensor #2. 
Am I hallucinating? Did they put it somewhere else on
some engines?  I don't really want to take everything
apart to pull the cooling tin and check out the
cylinder head itself.
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
I have had other late model buses, but they were all
earlier and this is the first fuel injected one that I
have had.
Thanks for the help (I hope)
