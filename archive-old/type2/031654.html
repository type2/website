&gt; &gt; Note that such guages were not considered necessary by the factory. Think
&gt; &gt;  about that. They weren't even offered as an option. Bad data can certainly

&gt; My opinion on this subject is that the factory is well aware that buses run 
&gt; hot.  They run so hot that they often fail catastrophically because of it.  


WHOA!!!  check the ads for buses from the 60's &amp; 70's  these were built as
inexpensive utility vehicles.. I doubt very much that ambulances, and
service trucks would have been built from something known to be prone to
failure.

I owned a 60 23window bus when I was in college, ??Change the oil, surely
you jest I can barely aford the gas....that thing was used and abused and
it ran well over 100,000 miles and was still going when it was destroyed
in a garage fire, (no the bus didn't cause it, the fire spread TO where
the bus was parked)

later I had a 65 Westy that again was used and abused, crossed the country
one time without shutting off the engine (starter problems) including
going over the rocky mountains, it ran over 100,000 miles.

later I got a new from the dealer, 71 dealer demo bus.  and I put over
100,000 miles on that one...took a little better care of it, and it gave
me over 100,000 miles before needing engine work.

in between I had a wife with a beetle that wouldn't know how to find the
dipstick much less how to change the oil...it was going strong when she
rolled it.

others in there all ran and ran.

these were built and sold as the buy it and ignore it, cheap
transportation, car for the masses, &quot;why put gauges in a car that no one
would look at and the car was so well made it didn't need em anyway.&quot;


it has only been in recent years that people even began to consider the VW
air cooled as anything special, and take care of them.

there were exceptions but the factory built to the lowest common
denominator, they felt that the people who took care of their cars would
buy a BMW or Porsche, so build em cheap and reliable.!

the fact that they are still around for us to worry with them is because
VW did build em that way.


IMO anyway
