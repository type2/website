Dok,
Friend gave me apparently 75 FI/auto bus 125k not running.

I/he knew nothing of VW and removed FI equip, installed weber prog and 009.  
Engine ran, if poorly.
No engine seal, probably intake boot/gasket leaks.  Timing probably advanced
in to the next TDC cycle.

Started to run bus up and down street troubleshooting auto tranny vac
troubles.  Lack of vac would cause bus to shift up while accelerating and then
when you let off the throttle, the bus would down shift into 2nd - driving
rpms into stratosphere.

Needless to say, bus stopped running.

Tear-down revealed #3 intake seat and port hammered out of head.  Most other
valves were leaking. Head is un-rebuildable garbage.

Stupidity/ignorance of said &quot;DM&quot; caused mine.

Others?

&gt; How 'bout it listees? Can we have a straw poll of empirative evidence???
&gt; If you have suffered a Type IV valve seat problem, give us a quick outline
&gt; of service history, milage, experience, etc. Check the Bentley. How many
have had cracks welded and
&gt; seats replaced???? How long did the fix last???? The machinist who did the 
&gt; work. Was he considered a masterful craftman by community report??? 
&gt; Was an annealing oven involed??? Just a solid journeyman??? &gt; 
&gt; Include a report please if you have owned same and NEVER had such problems.
&gt; Tell us about your service history, milage, experience. 
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt;
