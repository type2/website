Subject: Re: [T2] oil leak due to ??? cold??

Hello
 I own a 1978 VW  Bus. I am going to need a new transmission real soon.
I called the Bus Depot and the quote was for $1600 for a rebuilt by Rancho
Performance. What should be the labor to install this if I decide to buy
this?
Is there somewhere else on the East Coast near Philadelphia I can find one
for
a cheaper
Any tips would be helpful. Thanks and Happy Thanksgiving-Mark

&gt; Common sources for oil leaks are..
&gt;
&gt; - Oil pressure transducer
&gt; - Seals on oil cooler
&gt; - Oil filler tube
&gt;
&gt;   As it started suddenly I would start with the oil
&gt; pressure transducer (sender) Look at it an see if it
&gt; is
&gt; wet. If it is.... it is leaking.
&gt;   The oil cooler is a different story. Could be the
&gt; seal or the damn thing might have ruptured on you.
&gt;   I run an 1800 so not to sure on your 1600 where the
&gt; oil pressure sender is located.. look in the book if
&gt; you have one.
&gt;   Just a starting point. Good luck!
