Subject: Type 2 o-ring sizes.

Does anyone know the standard sizes of the o-rings for the type 2 engine?  i.e. what size are the o-rings on the pushrod tubes and oil pump?  A list with all the o-rings would be great.  Even better would be a list or chart with all the aircooled o-rings.  I would think someone would have compilied one somewhere.  My goal is to be able to go to any o-ring seller and give them a size, without having to attempt to measure a hardened or cracked oring.  I've looked at the archived lists and couldn't find any info.
 
Thanks, Doug
