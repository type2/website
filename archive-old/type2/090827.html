I have had them off for better than 5 years with no effect on the
cooling.
---------------------
I don't think that they (the rock guards under the cylinders and
pushrods) are there for the cooling.
I think they they are there to keep nice fresh cold or freezing water and
salt water off your nice hot cylinders.
