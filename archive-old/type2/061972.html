I don't get the &quot;wicked haircut&quot; reference, but if you're talking about 
things making it easier to poop while on VW bus trips, the answer is to 
get yourself a quality porta-potti.

Christa and I have a Thetford porta-potti which we keep in a box behind 
the passenger seat.  I built the box specifically for the purpose, and it 
not only holds the porta-potti but has compartments for toilet paper, 
porta-potti chemical, a toilet paper dispenser just like home, a place 
for books and magazines, and storage for about a grillion maps.  A lid 
pops down over the whole thing so one can sit on the box while making 
dinner at the westy stove--it's just the right height.  Total footprint 
for the box?  Maybe 30&quot; wide (it doesn't project into the passageway to 
the front at all) by perhaps 16&quot; deep.  And no, kids, no smell at all.

Absolutely essential for the kind of back-country exploring we like to do.
