Hey, i saw your posting on the type two list about the transporterfest.  do
you have details?  i'm committed to playing in an ultimate frisbee tournament
on sunday in maine, but i would love to go on saturday(if it is in fact a two
day thing).
so, thanks in advance for any info you can give me.  (also, where it is
specifically and other stuff you feel might be helpful)
thanks again
