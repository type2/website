&gt; Thanks for the info on the fuel filler neck.  I know I
&gt; neeed a new one.  I once had to show a 25 year old New
&gt; Jersian how to pump gas when we were on a business
&gt; trip to DC.  He didn't have a clue what to do!  I can
&gt; understand that in the People's Republic of New
&gt; Jersey, but Oregon??  Haven't they heard of free
&gt; market capitalism yet?  Cheers...KR
&gt;
&gt;    Now, now...The law against pumping your own gas
was merely an attempt to get employment for all
those outsourced Microsoft programmers who'd been
riding the rails across America looking for work...
   Prior to this program, gangs were congregating at
ATM's, offering their services as consultants at op-
erating the touch screens... ;-(
