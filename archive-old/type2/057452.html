Well, you might want to stick some voltage meter probes into those
sockets -- who knows, maybe somebody put an inverter in that bus.
Otherwise, no, your 120 volt fan won't work at all on 12v. But yes, you
can get 12v fans, lamps, coffee pots, drills, almost whatever -- check
out a big truckstop, a local RV dealer, or look at jade mountain.
(http://www.jademountain_dot_com) for a really good selection. Or you can
put in an inverter (which changes 12v to 120v, although for a price) and
run regular household stuff in your van. But the 12v appliances will be
more energy efficient.
