Subject: Re: [T2] wife and I trip -- luggage rack

If you had a Vanagon I would recommend the lockable enclosed 
luggage box like I have. Its made of fiderglass and looks a 
lot like one of those wind deflector things you see on 18 
wheelers. Check our www.vanagon_dot_org and click on &quot;Bagawest&quot;

Thanks,
Chris

&gt;
&gt;&gt; Does anyone have any good ideas about what the best way to 
&gt;&gt;utilize the luggage rack on top of my 74 westy??? 
&gt;
&gt;Put anything up there that 1.) you don't mind getting wet or 
wind-blown, 2.) 
&gt;isn't overly-inviting to theft, and 3.) you don't have to 
access very often.  
&gt;It's a pain putting multiple things up there.  I once loaded 
mine up with 
&gt;firewood for a campout.  Took forever to load it and way to 
long to unload it 
&gt;and I was afraid the whole drive up that the logs would come 
loose and go 
&gt;bouncing along the highway.
&gt;
&gt;Just remember, whatever you put up there makes your bus 
taller.  A Westy with 
&gt;nothing on top will pass through most parking garages and 
drive-throughs.  Add  
&gt;more than a few inches and you may not fit anymore!
