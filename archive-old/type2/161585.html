Subject: re: Stinky Upholstery

Don, There are quite a few enzyme-based products that will get rid of the 
smell. Before our GD Cat was fixed, we used &quot;Nature's Miracle&quot; for his 
territory marking. You can get it at any pet supply store, or online.

For your purposes, I'd go for the 1 1/2 gallon bottle and really soak the 
seats. You can even use it on the seats, wait for it to soak in, then re-try 
the little green machine. That size will run you about 30 bucks. A 24 oz. 
bottle should be 6 bucks. I guess it's worth a shot before junking or 
re-doing the upholstery. At least check it out on the web.
HTH -
Stephanie
