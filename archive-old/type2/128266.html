Subject: insulation

My son and I are rebuilding a 83 rabbit.. for insulation/sound
deadening
we went with a pipe wrap tape. It has a layer of aluminum and the rest
is
a sticky approx 1/4 thick stuff. So far it has remained attached to the
sheet metal very well.

  I have used this stuff on the joints for the heat pipe under DAS bus
also.. works well.. seals and insulates.. I am going to do the inside
when I get some time.. I am going to cover the sheet metal with the
pipe wrap stuff and then apply an additional layer of foil backed
bubble
type insulation over it with spray glue. Light weight.. doesnt absorb
moisture.. field proven. A number of westy owners use the same bubble
style insulation as a wrap around their pop top.. covering the canvas
when it is cold.. its just about the right width.. 

we'll see how it works (bus loops)
