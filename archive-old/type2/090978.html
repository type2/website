You need a small amount of air flow through the heater boxes to keep them from overheating.  The heater boxes have small vents for this purpose.

&gt;Because I mostly travel in very hot weather, i'm
&gt;curious about the benefits of diverting the fan
&gt;housing air.
&gt;
&gt;does it keep the engine cooler to BLOCK the clean-air
&gt;ducts, putting more air through the cylinders or to
&gt;keep them hooked up in the stock configuration
&gt;(blowing the heat off the heat exchangers?)
&gt;
&gt;Normally, I try to keep everything stock, but i'm in
&gt;the middle of a fresh-air hose hassle right now and am
&gt;looking for an excuse to put it off until winter.
&gt;
&gt;Tony in NJ sez :
&gt;On my 71 1600, I capped off the air ducts from the fan
&gt;housing
&gt;...snip...If you live in a very warm climate ..snip...
&gt;the air ducts might not be used and the &quot;extra&quot;
&gt;air better used to cool the engine...
