I would think a much easier way to cut something up would be with a Henrob
2000 cutting torch which is an amazing piece of kit. On the videos, you can
see a demonstration of a guy quickly cutting zig-zags through 1/2 inch
(possibly thicker) plate as cleanly as a plasma cutter. Hook it up to one of
those pint sized portable acetylene + oxygen tanks and there you go. No
batteries or electricity needed. So long as fire to the internals isn't a
problem, that is :)
