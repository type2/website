hi... im dave... i just got e-mail .. i guess if cars have computers now: than
this is ok too...i've been wrenchin' for fifteen years now and have been
having fun with it .... 

first thing.. one should never race a vw van that hasn't been tooled and
equiped to do so... there are those few sick examples out there , like for
example in the philipines there is no kiddin a summer race circut set up for
thoose who like to race bus's... as for your problem... if you were at
speed and hit  a flat spot in your excelation curve my first thought would be
to check your points perhaps there burned or the return spring isn't working ,
when in doupt its only four dollars to replace them and for god sake make sure
there set propely and your dwell angle is also ok  , ok! sorry got on my soap
box for a moment....because they regulate the performance of your motor
espicaly were excelation and performance are concerned ... also if you have a
carb with an auto choke shut of valve it could be sticking ... just buy some
carb cleaner at hit it with that.. also check you choke and make sure that it
is working freely....have fun and get dirty............

hello all well as i mentioned earlier i got my bus back yesterday. well
today i let my brother drive it. it was doing o.k. until we were about one
minute from home it started to race very fast and wouldn't excelerate,we
pulled over and it was pretty hot we had only been driving for about 15
minutes. i thought it night be the choke or carb but i'm not sure as i am
not to mechanically inclined.  after about five or so minutes of cool down
we cranked it up and it sounded fine i really doon't want a relapse so could
someone give me some suggestions? thank you very much...
