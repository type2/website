Subject: Re: Help needed: Headlight wiring on 1975 bus

Hi Jamie,

The &quot;other&quot; white wire is in place as you say. I will try attaching  
the white headlight wire to the bottom of fuse #6 and let you know  
how it goes.

Tomorrow.

Right now my spine feels like a pretzel from working under the  
steering wheel...

Thanks!

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

&gt;&gt; The  wiring diagram suggests the top of fuse #6, but that doesn't  
&gt;&gt; seem to  work. I suppose It's also possible that we might have  
&gt;&gt; multiple issues  here....
&gt;
&gt; From what you tell me,, the white wire your talking about goes to  
&gt; the bottom of fuse 5...
&gt; there is another white wire.. it goes from the relay to the top of  
&gt; fuse 5/6
