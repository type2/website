Subject: Re: [T2] update advice please FI? cyl 3 bad?

Hey Kyle,

Sorry for all the trouble you are going through. Wish I could just come over 
and help you out. I am in Charlotte, I have a 77 auto and John Baird is 
pretty good with FI, but we are both pretty busy right now.

I have a compression tool if you want to borrow it. I could ship it 
tommorrow, but you would have to promise to return it soon. Probably a good 
idea to buy one anyway, but I know what it's like to live until payday.

It is possible to remove the head without pulling the engine but it's a 
bear. I would consider pulling the engine if you CONFIRM that there is 
internal damage. I would keep testing first before pulling the engine for no 
reason.

Unfortunately the 79 head on your bus has square port heads, and the 78 will 
have the oval heads. This means that you would have to swap both heads and 
the heat exchangers/exhaust too.

You can pull the heads with wrenches, but to fix anything like a valve, etc. 
you would really need to take it to a machine shop. Other things you can do 
yourself, but let's cross that bridge if we get there.

I really think you should check compression and recheck all the other items 
before declaring a bad head or internal damage.

One thing I can help you with is posting a pic. If you want to send me the 
pic in an email I will post it on my website for you. There are others, and 
the samba and such that can help you post a pic too if need be.

Let me know if I can help further and good luck with it,

Rob Henley
