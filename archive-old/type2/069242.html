Subject: Removing door pannels

        Tom, 
        You don't mention what kind of bus you have... in my '70, the
window crank is held on through a screw in the middle of the axle
that the crank turns. You pry-away that plastic covering over the part
that goes round and round there there's the screw. The Bentley manual
has a picture, I'm sure. Use a large Philips head screw driver on
the screw itself.

        For the door lock, first you use a small, straight blade screw
driver to pry-out the plastic business at the back-inside of the inside
lock handle. This allows you to see the large, philips head screw holding
the metal bezel around the edges of the lock handle. Take out the
screw and the bezel and be coaxed out too. 

        With these handles removed, you still have to unscrew the pull-
loop thingy that you pull on to close the door from inside. Ok. got
all that?

        Now gently pry-out the clips that hold the inner pannel. Use a
broad screw-driver and pry right next to the clip, so you don't crack
the fiberboard the pannel is built on. 

        New clips and rubber grommets for clips can be bought from RMMW,
among others. Remember that there should be a plastic sheet vapor
barrier behind the inner pannel. The plastic should be glued or
taped if you have to, all the way around the inside of the door.

        Happy motoring!
        Bill
