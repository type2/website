&gt;Mike,

&gt;My 78 is welded on one side and has a screw holding the other
&gt;hinge under the seal.  Unscrew and then drop and twist from welded side.

I noticed that the other day and wondered why? Does anyone know?

The screw side is all painted over and pain to remove. The welded side is rusty from the seal helping to siphon water to it.
