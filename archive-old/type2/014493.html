Christopher,

After you get done grinding / sanding all the surface rust, get to your
local body shop supply and purchase two products, both by Dupont.

The first product is Metal Prep.
It is an acid etch wash, that will remove the remaining rust that is
embedded into all those rust dimples.

After this stuff dries, apply a couple of coats of Vari Prime, which is
an acid etch, zinc chromate primer.
It's kinda like galvanizing the metal.

After this stuff dries, scuff it, apply a coat of high fill primer (
Sherwin Williams Ultra-Fill is excellent) sand with no less than 320
paper, and give the area a good coat of paint.

The filling type primer is made from mostly clay, hence it's filling
properties, and a clay product by itself will attract moisture, much
like a flower pot.

These procedures will give you the best    long term results.

Good Luck,
