&gt;The ring should be out, as you figured. Check one thing. See if they have
&gt;shimmed the release arms to sit where they are. I think this may be done to
&gt;keep stress off the fingers or something. Look carefully at the pressure
&gt;plate, to see what holds the fingers where they are. If there is something
&gt;in there, remove it from all 3 arms. Tom

Am going to look to see if there might be something I can do right now !!
