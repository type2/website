Keep in mind that the majority of Beetle buyers had never owned a car
before.  Anything with an engine and wheels was a step up!

The sad thing is that VW does make &quot;People's Cars&quot;.  They just don't
market them in the US.  They have two models (Fox and Polo) that are much
more affordable than the low end Golferrabbit that they sell here.
Instead VW gives us silly stuff like the Phaeton, as if upscale buyers
would want a big VW emblem on the front of their luxury car.

Toyota sees the &quot;People's Car&quot; niche that VW abandoned here, filling
it with the Scion and Yaris lines.  VW can't be bothered.
