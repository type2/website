Hi,
	Welcome to the list!

&gt; ... After we ran
&gt; into our problems with our Subaru we found that it would be more
within our
&gt; budget to throw an engine in the bus.  We now have a 79 2000 c.c.
motor
&gt; pushing it. ...

 You do have the tinware and seals around the engine, don't you? What
I mean is that if you have your head in the engine bay you shouldn't
be able to see the road past the engine. I'm asking because it's 
likely to have been taken out when the watercooled engine was put
in and it's very important that it was put back when the aircooled
one was put back.


&gt; ..  I also have
&gt; another question, do all VW's smell like a gas chamber or do I have
some
&gt; sort of a problem?

 The heat does tend to have a distinct odour- either of hot oil, if you
have oil in the heat exchangers or of hot metal, if you don't. It
shouldn't be severe, though, just a friendly scent rather than an 
overpowering blast of noxious fumes!
 If your engine is running hot it would tend to be smellier.

 Hope this helps.

Cheers,
	W.
