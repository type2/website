Hi all!

This is strange. I have a 1978 F-I Riviera 2.0.

So, last night I was driving home and had to brake quickly for a red light. 
I braked so suddenly that a cinderblock (i.e. my emergency brake ;O) flew 
forward from between the front seats and landed on the accelerator for about

two to three seconds. A big &quot;vrooooom!&quot; let out, some exhaust, so I shut the

engine off. Then I got the brick off of the pedal, restarted the bus, and 
the battery light was on.

Help!!!

Thanks in advance, listees!

Best,
Pete Wootton
