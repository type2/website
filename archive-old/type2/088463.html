The cylinders will slide right off. Just pull on them.
Find the sheet metal underneath and remove it first.
Then you can remove the pistons.

&gt; Now for my dilemma. The cases are apart about 2.5&quot; and will not go back
&gt; together because one has &quot;fallen&quot; a few degrees out of rotation. Nor can I
&gt; find what is causing it to stay that way. I was able to twist the camshaft
&gt; out and drop the crankshaft *nearly* into its position in one case half.
&gt; However, the other case half will not rotate so that I can rejoin the cases
&gt; to get to the piston circlips. Note, the pistons are up inside the bores, so
&gt; the circlips are not reachable. Since I can't get the case back into
&gt; alignment, I can't withdraw the pistons...
