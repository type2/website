Subject: Re: 1600 DP in a 82 Vanagon

&gt; Anybody done it? Is it possible?...

and

&gt; Sure- VW did it. Sold a bunch of them in Europe: probably elsewhere, too.


My current 1600DP upright in my '71 came out of a Type3 and was all jazzed
up in a flat arrangement with a bunch of stuff I couldn't use, so perhaps
this is something like the combo you need.

I love driving my bus the 40 miles each way to work and back when the
opportunity arises. I don't do it every day because it's better suited to
the task of shuttling the kids around the neighborhood so my S.O. has all
the fun.
Not much left to fix up anymore, just minor things like glove compartments,
stereo, door seals. Oh and rebuild that spare engine in the shed. ;-)
