Meinen zwei pfennigs worth ..

Fur mich, correct tires (8-ply = stiff sidewalls, load range D), new shocks
(love dem KYBs all around - thanx Ron) and a replacement draglink (that's where
almost all of my steering slop turned out to be), in that order, make for a
much less spooky highway experience.
