Subject: Vacuum and timing

So I have this '76 I am just learning about (thanks to Richard Atwell for 
his wonderful pages!!).  It has retard and advance vacuum nipples on the 
distributor bisket.  I thought I had a replacement distributor, but it was 
the 'AB' suffix distributor.

My retard side was not hooked up, so I timed the ignition to a beautiful 7.5 
BTDC.

I saw the vacuum diagrams on ratwell's page, and I thought I would add on 
and connect a retard vacuum hose to the distributor and retime the ignition.

Snip, pinch, slip and I had a retard vacuum connected.

I rechecked the timing and found that it was as close to 5 ATDC as humanly 
possible to set!! (Well, this human, anyways!!)

Wow, it works!!  Now I am curious about what vacuum I am getting in each of 
the retard (manifold) and advance (throttle) vacuums.

So, what did I gain by adding the retard vacuum to the distributor??  
Answers requested....
