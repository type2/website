Subject: Re: [T2] Fitting Heat Exchangers to new heads?

Librarian,

ummmm....On a 78 converted to earlier model heat exchangers, I don't 
specifically remember any such supports.....unless you count the
alternator adjustment bracket on the passengers side....

What about the drivers side?
Any line drawings or pics on this one?
I can't see anything specific to the drivers side here:

The only thing that might help would be the clamps that hold the 
&quot;flappers&quot; area to the fan shroud...

Sure would like to support that side as well!

Cheers, dave
