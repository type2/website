Subject: CV washers, was: 72 Westy

&gt; Have you ever torn down a drive axel?  I need to replace the CV boots, and the book
&gt; says not to put back on the washer type thing behind the cv joint (know what I mean?)
&gt; Do you go by the book, or do you put the washer back on?

This has come up with me before.  It used to be that the boot kits had
a new washer.  In fact, it SHOULD be replaced.  The washer is cupped 
and this puts a tension on the joint that keeps it in the right place.
This is also why it should replaced since it looses that cup over time.
So, in the fairy tale land of all new parts in replacement kits, the 
book assumes that you can just throw it away since a shiny new one is 
in the kit you are using.  That now doesn't happen and people end up 
putting the thing together without any washer, just like the book 
seems to say.  Use the old washer if that is all you have, use a new 
one if you can find it.  I recently did a CV job on a bus that needed 
two new joints.  The old ones didn't have the washer in there and that
might have contributed to their demise.  If anyone knows of a source 
of these washers new I am all ears.
