Subject: install distributor drive: when?

After procrastinating for a week, reading too much on the subject, I'm
absolutely positively going to begin the rebuild of my 1776 tomorrow.  Goal
is to seal the case and maybe get the heads on by supper time.

A question, though. A few,  not all but a few, of the books that I have say
that the very first step in reassembly should be to install the distributor
shaft,  then lay the crank in, etc.

I've not done this with any of my other rebuilds.  This step came much
later in the sequence.

What are the pros and cons of doing this first?

Jack
