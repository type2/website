Subject: Re: [T2] Vac advance distributor hoses. Where do they go?

You may have to try them in different locations.
First you need to know the total advance they your distributor is
supposed to have at given RPMs.
Try it a couple of places until you get the proper full advance that is
called for in the specs.
Example TypeIV 2000cc air cooled: 9-14 degrees at 1800 rpm., 21-25
degrees at 3400 rpm.
Normally it just needs to connect to the base of the carb to get the
proper advance curve.
I prefer to use the rigid plastic vacuum lines with short hose end
connectors but I don't think it makes any real difference as long as the
hoses aren't collapsing with vacuum.

 *Where do the vacuum lines hook up from the vacuum can*
