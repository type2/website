Subject: Diagonal Arm Bushings

These things must be a &quot;Bermuda Triangle&quot; type item. I
have some urethane bushings I bought a few years back
at my VW FLAPS but they weren't sure if they would fit
my late Bay bus. Then a few minutes later, they WERE
sure they would fit. When I asked how they know that,
the reply was, &quot;They're the only ones. They have to
fit.&quot;

They're a BUGPACK item #6557, incidently...

On to the job at hand. I can't find any reference to
anybody who has done this. Bentley manual says they're
vulcanized and entire arms need to be replaced, but
there seem to be none available. Archive search found
many people asking this same question but no answers!

My intention is to use heat to remove the existing
ones, but if the replacements I have are not correct,
or if none are available, I'm in deep doo-doo.

Any thoughts, ideas, suggestions or comiserating is
welcomed. -BaH
