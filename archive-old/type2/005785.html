Yes.

Sometimes it's pretty subtle, so best to get your ear in there as close as
safely possible, but there should be a definite click as the solenoid is
alternately energized and de-energized.

If still in doubt, unscrew the idle cutoff solenoid and test it while you
watch the plunger for movement [don't forget to ground the body of the
solenoid].  The plunger should snap back and forth smartly.

Don't over-tighten it when you re-install it on the carburetor, as the carb
threads will strip fairly easily.  And don't forget to re-connect the
wire...

&gt;&gt;  Do carburetor solenoids (cutoff valves) click when power is applied?  &lt;&lt;
