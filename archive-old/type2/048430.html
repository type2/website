Subject: [T2] Putting a Sunroof in a Westy

Hey all
 It came up yesterday about installing a sunroof in a westy. I went and
looked at mine today and there are no drains. The holes are in the frame
work, but the hole just go down ito the body. If you install a sunroof
and do not install the drain tubes, you will fill the body with water and
rust will destroy.
