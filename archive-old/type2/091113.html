Subject: Re: [T2] engine pull

&gt; Muir was writing in the time of fixing splits that have the tranny bolted in
&gt; like in a bug.  For a '70 bus, a plastic milk crate is almost the perfect
&gt; height to support the tranny, sometimes with a short piece of 2x4.

For me. Supporting the tranny with a rope or chain looped over the frame
is way better whan putting it on blocks or a crate.
The bus is mobile and can easily be pushed around.
