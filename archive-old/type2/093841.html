Subject: RE: [T2] ugly bus/van entry


I did a little poking around on that site and found this.....
http://www.beaterz_dot_com/one_liners/0201/images/shuttle_bus.jpg

It is said to have been a vw bus before this happened to it, its almost
kinda cool, but I hope it was a real rust bucket before this was done.
