Subject: Re: [T2]front doors won't open
Date: Mon, 22 Jan 2001 05:57:46 US/Mountain

&gt;The front doors on my 72 westy won't open from the outside.  I've 
&gt;noticed the latch on the door is stuck.  Has anyone had this 
&gt;problem?  If so, is it just the outsite or do I have to take the 
&gt;panel off the door(s) to completely fix this. Note: doors WILL open 
&gt;from the inside, just not the outside.

Is it that the latches won't work or that you have to squeeze the dickens out 
of them to get them to work.  I'm suffering the latter on the passenger side of 
my 73.  I find that if I push in on the door while squeezing the latch it works 
just fine.  I'm thinking a good cleaning and a bit of grease on the striker may 
do the trick, but I haven't tried either yet...
