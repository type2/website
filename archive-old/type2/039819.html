Subject: tracking down shorts

Ok, I've spent all afternoon dealing with batteries. I took my old main
out -- it was such a beast to do AND it was the wrong kind of battery
anyway (posts were reversed) AND I couldn't even find a date on it AND
it was, like, Acme Brand (like in the coyote cartoons). So I bought a
shiny bright new battery, the right kind, and got it pretty little green
and red pads and a brand, spanking new ground cable cuz the old one
looked pathetic.

I was studying Muir last night in anticipation of all this, and he says
if your ground cable sparks when you touch it to the body, then you've
got a short somewhere and you need to track it down by taking each fuse
out one at a time to see which one DOESN'T spark, and that's the
culprit, it's somewhere on that fuse.

Now, here's the question: I still got spark when I took each and every
fuse out, one by one. Now what do I do? I don't want my shiny new
battery to get drained.

Also, the auxiliary battery weights a TON but I got that one out and it
needed water big time. It may be on its last legs....
