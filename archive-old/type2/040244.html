Subject: Re: What color is top of dash?

Hi Marv!

&gt; Each time I get a new junker, SO goes to AutoZone and buys a ready-made 
dash 
&gt;  mat of appropriate (I guess) color. Costs about $35. In most cases..about 
&gt;  20% of the price of my vehicles :(. I like Susanes' idea better. Custom 
made 
&gt;  ones are a nice fit, however, and velcro attachment is quick to install.

I didn't mention... I *do* use velcro to hold it in place... sews right into 
the back of the carpet, and it holds it in place.  Otherwise, it *does* slip 
around a bit!

The ex got a custom one for the Mercedes we had, and I hated that thing - it 
*almost* fit (Read that as &quot;Didn't fit worth a damn!&quot;) and the defrost duct 
cutouts weren't right... I had to modify it to the teeth, and for the $$$ (I 
think it was like $40 or somesuch) I felt I shouldn't have to.  That's why I 
make my own... a lot cheaper, and about the same work as it was to modify the 
&quot;custom-made&quot; one. Plus, WTW carpet is a lot more durable than that shag 
cloth they use.

Hugs,
