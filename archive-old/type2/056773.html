Subject: Re: Unknown knobs on the 74 Westy

  It's green, on the passenger side, and it has a diagram of a
&gt;coil on it.  When you pull it out, it lights up.  Neat, but I wonder 
what
&gt;else it does. 

It's the switch for the rear window defroster.

 There's also a hole to the right of this one, directly under
&gt;the glovebox.  Looks like it used to have another nifty knob, but I'm 
not
&gt;sure.  

No, this is the famous &quot;silver socket&quot; -- It's an accessory power socket 
that receives a special plug.  Like a cigarette lighter, but different 
:-)
