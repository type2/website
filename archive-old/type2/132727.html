Subject: RE: [VB] DA sander etc

Oly,

You might try Harbor Freight, they have an on-line store.  I bought a DA
from them a while back for around $25, works great for me.  If I was a pro
body man, then I would spend more, but for what it needs to do, it works
great.  I also got a roll of the 80 grit DA sticky paper from Harbor freight
too.  Sounds like you had a chem. reaction of some sort with the POR 15.
Anytime before I paint I rub down the area with mineral spirits, let dry and
then shoot the paint.

Good luck,
Gary
Round Rock, tx

better quality than what I'll get at HD?
