I have subscribed to this list in order to do what I promised SIR
International (207 W. Crowther Ave.; Placentia, CA  92870; 714-549-8628) I
would do if they continued to insist I pay them $425 for repairs to my
rebuilt engine that was still under warranty.  My mechanic here in New
Orleans
(where I live) told me to obtain an engine for
my '77 Transporter bus from this company because they offered warranty and
are (supposedly) reputable.

The engine received its first adjustment and oil change at 300 miles and
only
500 miles later all four exhaust valves went out of adjustment.  My mechanic
was baffled by this, and called SIR and asked if he could open it up because
he had never seen this happen before. The man is from Germany and has been
working on VW engines since he was 9 years old. Well SIR said no, return it
to them. They get it back and then claim that it
overheating was the problem and they had to replace gaskets, rings and
pistons to the tune of $425.. There are many reasons why my mechanic knows
that this is not so and he even spent over an hour on the phone arguing with
them. That was 3 months ago. I have since written the owner a letter and he
never responded and never has returned my phone calls either. So here I sit
with a partially restored bus and I now have to pay $425
to get the engine back in it so I can sell it.

Yes, Betsy the Bus is for sale. I can see now that my dream of having a VW
camper bus was folly since I am NOT mechanically inclined and don't plan to
become so.

After reading the posts on this list I can see that you guys keep your own
engines
running and while I admire that I just don't have that kind of know-how. If
anyone would like to e-mail me directly and advise me on the Selling of
Betsy, I'd sure appreciate it. But I am going to have to sell her (much as
it hurts) because
I've had her a year, made one failed trip from N.O. to New Mexico (had to
have transmission replaced upon arrival in N.M. and had major engine failure
on the way home--no compression--thus the rebuilt engine), and have done
nothing but spent money (almost $6K!)
trying to get her going mechanically--which includes a new paint job
(orange). I purchased a new pop top and seal kit which I never got
installed because Betsy's never been out of the shop long enough--so if
anybody
is looking to buy one, please contact me--I got it from Go Westy and it's
stilI in the cellophane. I can give you a more detailed history on an
individual basis if you e-mail me. It's truly been a year of disappointment
and I just want to move on.

Ya'll sound like cool people, so please give me some cool advice.

Angelique
