&lt;As far as I can tell it
&gt;bolts to the frame rails via supplied brackets and then the ends bolt to the
&gt;bolts which hold the spring plates on. Can anyone who has a rear bar verify
&gt;this or point me in the right direction?

The rear bar does not bolt to the frame rails, it is clamped with a urethane
bushing to the torsion tube.
It is also designed to be used in conjunction with a larger front bar,  to not
do so can give poor handling , most likely severe understeer, or &quot; push &quot;.
This may not be obvious at lower speeds, but becomes a more critical
factor at higher cornering speed such as might be encountered when
entering a freeway ramp a little too quickly. With the rear &quot;glued&quot; a little tighter,
and the front suspension factory soft, the basic balanced suspension
will be over the design limit . Don't get it wrong, these bars are great, but they
need to be mounted at both ends of the vehicle to function as intended.
