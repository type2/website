Subject: Labeling nuts, bolts and hoses
Message-Id: &lt;l03130304b34fbbcf3f76_at_[128.0.0.164]&gt;

&gt;Question: I know that Muir's book says to label everything you pull off --
&gt;but with what kind of tape???  Between grease and dirt, everything I've
&gt;tried just falls off.  The main thing that terrifies me about doing this is
&gt;the prospect of not being able to piece it together again.  I know it's a
&gt;silly thing, but I'm really curious.  Do you gurus just *know* what hooks up
&gt;where?  Or do you have some special super-sticky tape?  Or is my engine
&gt;compartment just unconscionably filthy?


When pulling off nuts and bolts from an engine, or anything else, I tell my
kids to get a piece of cardboard, stick the bolts through, tape the nuts on
and label.  White duct tape works very well on cables and hoses, just wrap
around and stick it back to its self.

In the course of rebuilding, it may be a long time before we put anything
back together, so the labels and cardboard work wonders.
