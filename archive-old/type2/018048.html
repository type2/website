&gt; brake hoses are new so probably either the adjustments are uneven or maybe
&gt; one side has oil fouled shoes.
&gt; or maybe the wheel cyl on one side is bad. if it pulls to the left look
&gt; for a prob on the right side first.

I'll ask about this, thought all that stuff was supposed to have been
checked out--god forbid I have oil fouled brake pads.

&lt;sigh&gt;.  I guess I'll have them check the cylinders too. . . 

Thanks.
