Subject: Re: [T2] FI/Carbs/Simplicity/Reliability

90% or more of all fuel injection system faults coming into our  shop 
or that i have seen in my own maintenance work  come under the heading 
of operator maintence (the lack of)  the simple task  of aircleaners, 
pc valve, oil leaks,  thermostats, coolant, etc.  i have rarely seen a 
bad injector that couldnt be put on a cleaner for a  day and restored 
to use.  simply using injector cleaner (the only  addative that VW  
recommends that you use in your engine) every few months will keep that 
from happening.  I have  found injection systems to be easier to 
maintain  than carbs on many vehicles.
