Subject: Type 1 starter on pancake

When I picked up my rebuilt starter from the auto electric guy, he 
notified me that I had a Type I starter turning over my 2.0l engine. The 
proper starter is just longer/stronger, he said.

Well, it's worked fine--even in sub-zero temps--for the last 6 years. So 
if you of you cheapos don't want to pay $160 for a Bosch rebuilt starter, 
consider using the Bug starter under the table in the back of the garage ...
