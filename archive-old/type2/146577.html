Subject: unhappy camper on a miserable sunday

Sooo..yesterday I spit shine the Yellow Sub (73 restored Westy) in anticipation of my first VW classic I've been looking forward to for months to hang/meet with fellow type 2s, hunt for stuff and have a great time. This morning crack of dawn, I load up the bus cooler with drinks, kiss the wife adieu, grab some CDs and coffee for the hour long ride, bring some cool camping trip photos and my Brekina replica model, go to start the bus and SHE DON'T. Plenty of juice, starter cranks but no combustion engine. I proceed to check every single fuse, ground and connection known to the bus. Same thing, plenty of crank but no fire. Follow and reread both Bentley and Muir several times, wrench and check away carbs, fuel, etc.-no combustion. Start hunting around the distributor cap, rotor and wires, find one wire pretty grey-green crud, clean it up-same no fire. Check and recheck. Go to local FLAPS (bumboys and moronzone cause the good FLAPS aint open on sunday) figure repalce the set to make sure, neither store has new set of wires or anything 73 bus for that matter. But they have plenty of glitter car  junk.Back to checking and seem to have spark at no 1 but nary a sputter at the rest....huh? Bus has Petronic High Fire ignition is that it? Go through that manual but no results. Check and recheck ad infintum. 7 hours later I have given up for the day, missed the VW classic and the Road Kings show....oh joy. Guess it's order time to Ron....while I commiserate in my beer.
