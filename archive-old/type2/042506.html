&gt; You could try cutting the shield off the end of a length of coax for about
&gt; an inch or two, then looping the end around one of the wires.  You will need
&gt; to make sure the scope input is well protected though, I don't want to be
&gt; held responsible if you blow the front end :-O

--&gt; You'd probably be okay if you had the scope set on AC coupling.  Most
can withstand a kV or two in that mode, and I wouldn't expect more than
that to capacatively couple to the shield.  You might also try a couple
turns of wire around the ignition lead.  Use something with decent
insulation to reduce the risk of it zapping your 'scope if your ignition
lead has cracked insulation.  If you ground one side of the wire you're
probably safe, though, since any arc-over would go to ground instead of
through the 'scope.

&gt; Does anyone know how the pickup on a timing light works?

--&gt; Most I've seen are inductive.  They use a ferrite core in the clamp,
and have windings inside.  It's basically a transformer, with a one-turn
primary consisting of the ignition wire.  I wouldn't cut the clamp off a
timing light and use it as a 'scope input, though; a Xenon tube needs
several thousand volts to fire its trigger coil, and they're probably
getting it from that clamp by using a lot of windings.

I'm not sure how you'd display all four signals.  You might be able to
just use four coupling loops, all in series or parallel, and get a
nice display showing four pulses in a row.  You could trigger the 'scope
either off the first pulse, or ideally off the crankshaft position sensor,
if you have one.  On the other hand, if you have a four-channel 'scope
(rare), just run each into a seperate channel.
