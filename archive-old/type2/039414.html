Subject: damaged nose on '79 

Hello
I just purchased a '76 campmobile in pretty fair
condition.  The nose panel around the passenger's side
headlight is pushed in pretty badly and it will need
to be repaired before I can put it on the road. There
is also a lot of rust at the seal along the lower edge
of the windsheild. Rather than repair the body damage
and be left with the rust, I was consierding replacing
the whole nose panel. California Imports sells the
nose panel for less than $200. 

I realize the panel will need to be welded in place
however I don't really have an appreciation as to how
easy or difficult the panel replacement will be. I
plan to have a body shop do the work in either case. 

I would appreciate it if anyone who has replaced the
nose panel would provide me with their advise on doing
a repair vs a replacement. 

Gary
