&gt; &gt; All of the FI vehicles were minus the AFMs but little else was

&gt; There's no AFM on the Type 3, they use a Manifold Pressure Sensor.

&gt; It is indeed sad to see perfectly viable old VW's in the junkyards ..
&gt; and
&gt; non VW's as well.  There was a *beautiful* '72 Mercedes 2x0 coupe in
&gt; a yard here a few weeks ago that broke my heart to see in there, not a
&gt; thing wrong with it.   I've seen sharp Volvo 122's and BMW 2002's in
&gt; the past, and an absolutely *cherry* Opel Kadett one time.
&gt;
&gt; While it's not so much the case in the Type 2 world (though it is to a
&gt; degree) with Type 3 it's very much the case that &quot;some must die that
&gt; others may live&quot; because there are few new parts available.  And I've
&gt; done a couple &quot;nose jobs&quot; on those cars when they've been hit, it's not
&gt; easy.  Plus, the only place to get replacement panels is another car...
&gt;
&gt;
I don't know. If I had the money, I would buy the lot of them, fix them up
and resell them. I know my idea is old hat, but since watching the
Barrett-Jackson, I see a lot of potential in all these classic vehicles, one
must just have access to the cash to make it happen.

Part of me would still like to open a shop to rebuild these.
