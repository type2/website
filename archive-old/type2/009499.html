I found this forgotten in my mail &quot;In progress&quot; folder, will send now; it
was about what this curcuit does or how one can insert their own &quot;switch&quot;....
Steve,
     The FI diagram shows the altitude controller as a variable resistance
device with leads going to 6, 9, &amp; 12 of the ECU.   12 seems to be a unique
input for this device; 6 &amp; 9 are also the inputs for the intake air sensor
(volume of air flow measured by resistance changes as flap opens).  The
book lists the range of value for the resistance between 6 and 12 as
200-2000 ohms, and 1000 to 10,000 ohms between 6 and 9.   Given that the
gas flow is metered according to the amount of air the ECU is led to
believe is coming in, and since more oxygen is needed for the same gas at
high altitudes,  I'd think the system must either give less gas or more
air.....obviously it must give less gas (leaner mix) at high altitudes, ie,
be fooled into thinking the volume coming in is LESS.  I forget right now
whether the sensed resistance goes up or down as the AFM flap opens, but I
suspect the altitude curcuit (or a switch) acts to change this resistance
by a value depending on the altitude...a barometric control in the factory
install, or a set resistance in your switch that wound increase overall
resistance if in series with the AFM curcuit or decrease it if run across
the resistance.   It has to be fooled into thinking the vane is more closed
than it really is.   I recall there was at least one person on this list
who added a variable resistor in series with the flap coltrolled resistor
arm, and could &quot;dial in&quot; the right mix with the reading from an oxygen
exhaust sensor!
