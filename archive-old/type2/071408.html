Message-ID: &lt;d7679e1c.248d6508_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Hi one and all,
Today I got a message on my machine from a damsel in distress.  She lives in 
or near San Diego, is a single mom, a student, and her '73 is broke down.  
She is looking for someone to help her out.  Please P-mail me and I can give 
you her phone number.  She sounds pretty desperate, I hope someone down there 
can help her.
Thanks
Gary Morgan (CA)

PS can someone forward this to the 68-up list?
