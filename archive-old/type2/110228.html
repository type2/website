Subject: Re: [T2] Ebay Scam alert, BEWARE!

&lt;&lt; Moral of the story is, when buying a welder DO NOT
look on Ebay. And if you do, ask the seller where it
will be shipped from then goto that company and buy it
direct. Or do as I did, and go to the local Home
Improvement warehouse and charge it!! 
I am glad I discovered this scam before I bought
anything, and I hope this advice helps others who may
be looking to buy a welder for their bus\bug\whatever!
 &gt;&gt;

BTW, there's an infomercial running on TV these days with
(for only $49.95 or whatever) complete directions on how
to do this scam...They don't specifically mention ebay but
the reference is obvious...It's not just welders, but almost
any product can be sold this way...I've got other &quot;orphan&quot;
cars and it's obvious that some ads on ebay for parts are
just some individuals acting as middlemen for a real &quot;brick
and mortar&quot; parts sellers. if you're into cars in general,
another scam is the &quot;out-of-print&quot; books and manuals...
Cross-referencing often reveals that the books being of-
fered aren't OOP at all...Saw a type 2 Bentley being bid up
to about $70...8-(
