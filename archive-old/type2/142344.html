Sounds like you've got hydraulic lifters.

&gt;As suspected - godforsaken
&gt;racket coming from the engine.  I mean, the SOB is
&gt;RAPPING!  Like someone taking a hammer to the valve
&gt;covers.  Raps at idle and at all range of RPM.  Got 10
&gt;psi oil pressure or so at idle, 25 or so when above
&gt;idle.  No loss of power, seemed like all cyl were
&gt;firing.

Your oil pressure readings seem on the low side.

Does the engine noise sound like this?

If so, read my lifter article (sorry it's so long):
