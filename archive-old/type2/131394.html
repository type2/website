[Homer Simpson] Doh! [/Homer Simpson]

That makes sense!

I had forgotten that's where the spare goes, since this bus didn't come with 
a spare at all, and I bought a nose mount. I had planned that well for a

They are the bumpers to keep the spare tire from rubbing on the body.  The
spare tire well is directly below them (and below the mattress in the
