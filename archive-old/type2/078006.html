Subject: How to take out the plastic bolt from heater control nob???

Hello All,

I've tried to take out that 4 pieces of plastic under the dash that hold the
heater control nob in order to remove speedo for repair on 71 Westy. What's
the best way to do this? It's pretty hard to use hand to squeez them, and if
I use something else, I might break them. Is there some way to do this
better way? Also, it doen not have enough room for my hand do the trick...
is there better way to take out the speedo?

Thanks
William

71 Westy
