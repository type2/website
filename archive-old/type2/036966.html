Well, the cylinders are hot, so the tin covering them will be too.

Grab the dipstick.  Too hot to hold for more than a few seconds?  then
you're too hot.

Is the rubber seal around the engine tin in good shape?  No air leaks
between bottom and top?  heater and preheater hoses in place or holes
plugged?  Timing set right?

&gt;  What should I check out
&gt; first?  Should I replace the oil bath setup with a paper element?

Keep the oil bath filter.  Works fine.
