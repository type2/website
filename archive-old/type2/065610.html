I'm trying to find Velvet Green and Lotus White.
- - - 

Velvet green is  L 512 (38)

I see no velvet green/lotus white combo

64 - 65 could be Velvet Green/Blue White (like Nellie)      blue white  L289
(17)

66-67   had the option   Velvet Green/ Pearl White                  pearl
white  L 87 ( 13)

- - - -the Blue-White is brighter, the Pearl White creamier.

the code for Lotus White is 282 (42)  ,  available as the all white passenger
bus in 66&amp;67, but not as a combination with Velvet Green.

Hope this helps,  clara
