Alex,
  Look in your eng compart. and see if there is a bracket hanging
from the top with a relay switch just forward of the deck hatch.
the fan works off that connection. If it is still there you can go one
better and install a round bilge blower fan in line with the heater
pipe under the bus... if you live in a  area that gets cold it is worth
the conversion... I have a jpg dwg on my page of how I did mine. Wurks
well! let me know if you would like more info
than what is on my site. The original fan hangs off the deck and has
two outputs into hoses .. to the heater boxes... but the fand sucking
the hot air from the front works a lot better than the fan trying to
push it from the back... let me know if you want more detail.   
---------------------
My next question has to do with my heat. The PO installed a 2200cc
engine and they lived in CA and didnt seem to hook back up the
blower for the heating system. 72 up has a blower in the engine
compartment that blows the air through the heater boxes to the
interior right???? I just read about it try to fix my heat
since there is no blower or heat tubes in the engine compartment
I guess it just missing.?
So could you guys try and help set me straight on the way the heat
system is supposed to be setup on this year model.

Alex W,
