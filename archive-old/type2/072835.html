Subject: Mummified '74

Neighbor has a '74 bus that was parked under a tree after her father had a
heart attack 20 years ago!

It was running fine the day he died. 57k actual miles. Engine turns over
and it shows 140 psi on all cylinders. (didn't attempt to start it, of
course.) Shifter is gummy, but moves.
Faded paint, a little rust and a couple dents. The front seats have rotted.

Any savvy appreciated on what would it take (labor and $) to bring this
baby back to life? What's it worth?
