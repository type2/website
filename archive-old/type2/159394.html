Subject: engine back in, not running yet, but soon!

Hey everyone,
I finally got the engine back in the car.  I haven't gotten it running 
yet, but at least the car's off the jacks and I can close my garage door 
again.  I ended up breaking the glaze on the old cylinders and reusing 
the rings as putting new rings on wasn't an option for me at this time. 
  Hopefully I don't get horrible compression but I guess I'll find out 
soon enough.  I would have loved to change them, but I really didn't 
have the time to change them out.  This was a really tough decision, but 
since I need the car running pretty soon, I thought I'd give the used 
rings a go and see what happens.  I'm kinda curious to see if they'll 
actually work or not...

I did put two new AMC heads on because I figured I might as well change 
both instead of just one.  Other than that, tonight I have to put the 
rest of the exhaust back on and I should be running again.  I also 
cleaned the tin so it's all shiny again ;)

thanks!
Mike
