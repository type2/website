Subject: Leak down test results...interpretation?


Folks,

Since this is my first experience with a leak down test, I could use some 
data interpretation help.

1978 stock fi bus.  Sat for 8 years.  132k original miles.
Seems to run better everytime I take it out...maybe 300 miles since I got 
it running with a *clean* gas tank...It will do 80mph if the speedo is to 
be believed.

#3  80#hot                       #1   70#hot
    95#cold                           75#cold
    &lt;95% leakdown                     80%leakdown
                                      I can feel it in the exhaust.

#4  132#hot                      #2   130#hot
    150#cold                          150#cold
    &lt;95% leakdown                     &lt;95% leakdown


#1 cylinder is obvious...bad exhaust valve

#2-#4 not so obvious to me....I can barely get the needle off of what 
looks to be 100%.....why then would the compresion test on #3 look so bad?
#1 is sooo obvious.._dot_can feel it in the exhaust and it makes a lot of 
hissing noise...the others seem very quiet...hardly any hissing at all.


All valves(hydro) adjusted(1.5 turns) when I replaced push rod tube 
seals...no obvious valve stems sticking out any different than 
the others...#1 side *sounds* noisy, but the others seem to be 
fine...#1 side sound like an exhaust manifold leak, but I can't 
hear it any better if I momentarily plug the exhaust.

The lifters seem to pump up better every time I drive it also...after a 
5-10 miles run, it sounds very quiet except for what sounds like and 
exhaust manifold leak on the #1 side....and that even sounds better after
the 5-10 mile run.


Comments/suggestions?

Cheers, dave
