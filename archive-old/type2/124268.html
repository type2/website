Subject: Dash heat and vent control square knobs-removable?

Silly question, but I want to install my Baywindow clock and I need to
remove the dash guage panel. The blue and red rubberish knobs seemed to
just pull on the lever. Are these removeable really, or do I have to
reach behind and get the outer lever part off before removing the guage
panel?
Thanks,
Al
