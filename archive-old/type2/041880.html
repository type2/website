we will have a unit available within two weeks that blows away anything
currently available under $1K. Ours will sell for $229 for the whole kit.

&quot;normal&quot; operation with the cheaper units often includes the meter pegging
to full rich or full lean, even when the engine is operating normally at a
good A/F ratio. Another one is where the meter takes FOREVER to respond to
O2 levels. These are both very common with the cheaper kits, so do your
homework.
