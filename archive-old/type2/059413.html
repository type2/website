I'm told that a bad coil can cause this condition.

&gt;   Ramona rests, and neither of us like that.
&gt;   Here's what's happening, and I am perplexed.
&gt;   New battery, new top-end rebuilt, relatively good starter, same-o on the
&gt; regulator. So here's the rub; I hop in and go to start 'er, both red lights
&gt; shine bright at the first turn of the key, she starts and sounds great, she
&gt; idles and warms and I cut her off (old tags for now; no drag around the
&gt; block). Then I wait maybe 10 seconds and try her again. Her reds do not even
&gt; come on some times, and if they do they go dim and I get nothing. Click,
&gt; click,click, NADA. Making me nuts.
