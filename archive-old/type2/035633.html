&gt;IAP or WAWD?  Are they as good as AVP and Stephens heads?  Should I tell the
&gt;mechanic that I want AVP (or Stephens) heads instead and order them myself?

IAP and WAWD are simply parts supply houses, they are not head 
manufacturers or rebuilders.  The type 4 heads they sell are AMC Spain 
heads.

I bought a pair if AVP rebuilt heads this summer to rebuild the engine in 
a friend's 79 Westy.  I was not impressed with them because they were 
rebuilt AMCs with sloppy welding and threaded inserts.  They have worked 
fine for the last 6 months.  Although I have had several issues with AVP 
due to quality control, they have been good to deal with and I respect 
their attempts to stand behind their work.

If you go with Mark Stephens, plan on buying them outright.  The only way 
anyone I know has gotten core charges back from them is if they sent them 
heads that did not need to be rebuilt.  The 100k waranty is BS...  the 
only waranty worth a damn is the one you never have to use.

When I needed heads for my 81 Westy I wanted to get the German castings 
bare &amp; install the valves &amp; guides myself, but nobody at Reichert would 
return my email inquiries and I could not get a response from anyone on 
the list who had dealt with them before.  I was offered a set of used 
AMC heads with only a few miles on them from a Vanagon that got totalled.
It was an offer I could not refuse price-wise, so I went with them.  I 
lowered the compression and I guess I will see how they last.

When it comes to type 4 head choices, you are at a Vegas casino &amp; you 
pay your money &amp; take your chances.  You may not break the bank, but if 
you are lucky you *might* break even.
