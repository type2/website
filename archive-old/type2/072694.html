I lost who originally posted the thread but I have some questions?


&gt; only things I noticed were that the chambers are marked 48cc's when I
&gt; specified 47 (no big deal - a little lower compression won't hurt)

What is the standard chamber size of a stock 2 litre head?  If the head is
fly cut.030, how may cc's is it lowered?

I am just now rebuilding an engine and researching this CR/ deck height
issue. My deck height with no shims or gaskets is.020.  The piston dish is
approximately 17-18 cc's.  I haven't picked up my heads yet but I expect a
fly cut of .030 so the chamber volume should be around 48 CC ( I'm guessing
&gt;from information I've seen in a March 98 &quot;Hot VW&quot;s&quot;.)

To get a CR of around 7.5:1 I surmise I need a bottom shim of .045&quot; (which
I have a set of).

I find this math intriquing.  I have converted the formulas to a spread
sheet program.  It's amazing of how if you undersize your shims and fly cut
how fast your CR will rise.

The Spreadssheet setup is as follows:  (if you care)

Cylinder VOLUME Swept ... ..............492.724148 cc's  (a)  constant for
2liter
Divided by................................6.5            (b)
Less Chamber, piston dish................65 cc's         (c)

Equals VOL dh............................10.803715 cc's  (d)

Deck Height mm........................... 1.55678136 mm  (e)

Deck Height in .001&quot;.......................0.061337&quot;     (f)


(a) 0.785398 (pi/4) times diameter (94mm)^2 times stroke (71 mm): or 1970cc /4

(b) Vol (t) (total)= Vol (s) (swept) + Vol (dh) (deck height) + Chamber
(+piston)
so if you want a CR of 7.5:1 the formula is:

                                 Vol(t)/7.5= Vol (dh) + CH   or

                                &lt;Vol(s)+(Vol(dh)+Ch)/7.5&gt; = &lt;Vol(dh)+ch&gt; or

                                &lt;Vol(s)+(Vol(dh)+Ch) = 7.5&lt;Vol(dh)+ch&gt;   or

                                Vol(s) = 6.5 &lt;Vol(dh)+Ch&gt; or

                                Vol(s)/6.5 = V(dh) + ch  or

                                &lt;Vol(s)/6.5&gt; - Ch = Vol(dh)

(c) Chamber 48cc ?, piston 17 cc equals  a total chamber of 65 cc's

(d) Simple subtraction

(e) divided by the area of the cylinder

(f) convert to inches


LOOKS COMPLICATED BUT AFTER YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS FOR A WHILE IT'S REALLY
QUITE EASY.

Have fun
