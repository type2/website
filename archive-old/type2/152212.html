&gt; Ok. Its cold here in MD right now, and my blower motor went out.
&gt;
&gt; First, does anyone have one, or know where I can get a new one?

I think I may have one out in the garage, since I don't even use one I
know mine is in there somewhere from when I removed it...

&gt; that next in an attempt to pump up the heat output.

gas fired aux is the only thing I have found to work.  my BA4 will drive
me out on a day like today (when it is working) and I don't even have a
stock system at all.

&gt; I hate the cold

and you live in Maryland??????

&gt; Dave.

BTW, nice paint job on your bus, who did the body work??

&gt; &quot;Experts made the Titanic. Amateurs made the ark.&quot;

yeah but those amateurs had a heck of a consulting engineer...

Merry Christmas
