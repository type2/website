 That HF tool looks a little iffy to me.  Seems like it would be easy
 for that little ring to slip and open the flood gates.

I still think the Stahlwille SF12975 is the best.  I happily used a
pair this past weekend when replacing my fuel pump.

 Jason,
 The HF version is perfectly stable.  Been using them for over a year.  It
 does NOT slip at all,  Doesn't leak, doesn't mar the fuel line and best of
 all doesn't hurt my pocketbook.
 
 PS the link didn't work to the above tool you mentioned.
