&gt;   All these are opportunities for the Air Cooled Search and Rescue Team. Some

&gt; some time, and seen the familiar friendly shape of a splitty or Bug, and wished
&gt; we could give it a good home. Many of us even do try to give it a good home, or
&gt; at least pass it along to someone else who will love it and treat it right.
&gt;   They aren't making any more of them, and it's such a shame to see the ones
&gt; still around falling to pieces. We must do what we can to save them all. Bring
&gt; them into your driveways! Never mind what the wife/husband/kids will say. Never
&gt; mind the neighbors- they probably already think you're crazy!

What are the legal ramifications/issues involved in rescuing 
an abandoned vehicle? I have had my eye on a bug carcass 
sitting in the middle of a feild for a couple of weeks now. 
The feild is really more of a semi vacant lot with a half 
collapsed house on it. I could just load it onto a trailer, 
but I would want to register it someday...and not get busted 
for auto theft.

any thoughts?
