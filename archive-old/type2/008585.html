Well, if I remember right, the gross train weight of a camper is 3 tonnes, ie. 6600 lbs!
Of course, you'd have to tow a trailer as its still a 1 ton van, ie. 5200 lbs
max without a trailer. My camper weighs 1740kgs, ie. 3830lbs, with me in it.

Hmmm, the Eurovan has 4.5 ton GTW, ie. 9900lbs

I defy anyone to load up a bus to 6,000 lbs in normal use.  Even
5,000 is a stretch.  Mine weighed 4100 fully loaded, with two people on
board plus fridge, batteries, propane tank, stove, dutch oven, tons of
tools, extra cylinder heads, and enough other crap to sustain those two
people for a month's journey.  And I thought *that* was heavy!  It was over
two tons, for pete's sake.  6,000 boggles the mind...  no offense to my
friend Mr. Seaver.  :)
