&gt;From: &quot;Karl&quot; It is in EVERY FI bus. But it is only for the backup lights. 
&gt;It is the junction point for the B+ to feed the
&gt;double relay so it knows the ignition is on.

&gt;If you want, I can take a pic of it in my 77 Westy and my 78 Westy.

Man Karl please take that pic I need it. Maybe I am just not seeing it. I 
have no reason not to believe you or justify that it should be there, I just 
can't find it on my bus. A pic would help a great deal.

Thanks,

Michael Knight
'77 Westy Deluxe, &quot;el Verde&quot;
