Subject: Need help retrofitting fuel tank
Message-Id: &lt;3.0.1.32.19990414152724.006e7cac_at_mail.gadgetguy_dot_com&gt;

I have a '77 Westy with a 1600cc upright in it. My fuel tank is rusted
beyond all recognition, with the usual undesirable consequences. I recently
acquired a new fuel tank, fixed it up thoroughly (and then spent a very
long time removing tank sealant from the fuel line hookups I forgot to
plug), and took it to my mechanic in order to save some time. My mechanic
sat on it for two weeks before discovering that he would have to remove the
engine to get to the fuel tank, and then refused to do it. Nashville's best
known VW mechanic, Paul Shirley, having retired, I called a place in a
neighboring town I had heard about. They informed me that they mostly do
bugs and wouldn't touch a bus fuel tank job &quot;because you gotta take the
motor out&quot;.

Now I'm out of options other than doing it myself. Problem is, I know these
later model tanks have more lines coming out of them to accommodate the
dual carbs on the original motor. I'm sure I can figure out what goes where
by observing the existing tank, but I don't know how to plug the extra
lines. What should I use?

TIA,
Eric
