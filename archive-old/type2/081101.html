Subject: Re: [T2] Engine removal question.

Actually, I thought it was a case where the feds and not the accountants
won, as in the bus required more crash worthiness. As illustrated in the
deformation zone in the front of the later buses. Can't see where the extra
20 ponies woulda caused much flex. But then I've been wrong before : )

&gt; &gt; &gt; Why not just cut the body-metal in the lower back of the engine
compartment
&gt; &gt; &gt; on both sides (like it is done on split-screen buses).
&gt; &gt; &gt; Then weld some mounting to the cut off-piece and the sides of the
engine
&gt; &gt; &gt; compartment, get that rust off and do some painting.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I did this to my '78 2liter.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; This is an excellent idea if you intend to keep the bus for a while.  VW
&gt; &gt; did this themselves with the early bays, so there's no structural reason
&gt; &gt; to keep the panel welded in place.  I think that VW had a
&gt; &gt; significant maintainance philosophy change with the type IV.  The type-1
&gt; &gt; bus was engineered for easy maintainance, while the later buses seem to
&gt; &gt; make the assumption that you will have a lift with which to extract the
&gt; &gt; engine.
&gt;
&gt; Timo, George,
&gt;
&gt; I am sorry to say I have to disagree.  If you have a 1600cc engine, as
&gt; many European buses did, cutting out the rear member will probably not be
&gt; a problem, but I believe that VW welded in the rear skirt on the later
&gt; buses not to make maintainance more difficult, but rather to decrease flex
&gt; under the increased torque of the later, larger T4 engine.  As I look at
&gt; bus design thru the years, I see many cases where the engineers and
&gt; accountants fought battles and I think this is a case where the engineers
&gt; won.  I can see the arguement between the engineers going for increased
&gt; strength vs. the accountants going for cheaper manufacturing as I write,
&gt; and in cases where there is engineers scored, I am willing to let them
&gt; maintain the victory.
