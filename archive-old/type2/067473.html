&gt;&gt;I don't know the roots of his thinking, but the bus was the brainchild of

I stand corrected! Pon didn't build the first bus, but he was responsible
for it. I never was good at history, but from the site listed below (thanks
Sarah), here's the scoop:

/Probably the best thing Pon did for VW was the invention of the bus !When
he /was at the factory in 1947 he saw a bug chassis with a big loading floor
and a /cabin above the engine. It was used to move parts inside the factory.
The /workers called it the Plattenwagen. When Pon was back in Holland he
talked /about importing it to Holland, but the position of the driver was
unacceptable /for the department of transportation. Pon started to think
about a van based on /the bugs chassis but with the driver up front. He made
a drawing of his idea /and at his next visit to the factory on April 23,
1947 (almost 50 years ago, /there's gona be a party) he showed it to the
manager of VWaG. He saw it's /potential and in the fall of 1948 the first
prototypes where built. The first /prototypes used the normal bugs pan, but
it had to be reinforced to take the /extra load. Production started in
February, 1950.

Lots more good info and pictures too! Definitely worth a visit.

Now, like the man said, there's gonna be a party. And IMHO, WE should be the
ones responsible for the biggest bus birthday party ever known. That is,
April 23, 1997 looks like PARTY TIME! From my calendar, that day falls on a
Wednesday (bummer), but maybe there's a way to really do this up bigtime.
Wouldn't it be cool to have a huge vanagon/type2 get-together somewhere (or
in several locations) on that day. I'm thinking 100+ buses converging for
several days of celebration. I haven't heard if LIMBO or NEATO are already
planning big celebrations. Anybody know?

&gt;It's a Dutch site (Ben Pon himself was Dutch). He was also the first person
&gt;to import a beetle into the USA.
