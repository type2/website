Subject: 2 liter questions

I find myself being drawn back to the world of bay-windows after a long hiatus as a split-only owner. I'm thinking of buying a '74 Sportsmobile Automatic with a blown 1800 -- looks like a balding guy with a flat-top haircut. The thing is, I know nothing about Type 4 engines. 

Found a dude who will sell me a &quot;running when pulled&quot; 2.0 liter reasonably. Originally, he said it had all the FI stuff with it, but pictures sent by e-mail today reveal a carb on top.

This will be a mail-order deal, with me forking over a bunch of money for an engine I can't inspect first. You don't need to reply telling me how risky this is. I already know. But it has all kinds of stuff on it, including tin and a honker carb, so it's probably worth the money even if it turns out to be a pig inside...as long as the case ain't got big holes in it.

I've asked dude to get the engine number off the case for me so I can hopefully determine whether it is an 1800 or 1700 rather than a 2.0 liter. Is that number in the same location as it is on a 1600?

Anyone with experience with 2.0 liters that would like to see and comment on the pictures for me, please let me know; I'll be happy to e-mail them to you.

I've read in the archives some about carbs vs. FI on 2.0 liters and in truth, I was ready to move to FI and learn what I needed to -- big jump in technology, I think -- but the deal at hand is the deal at hand. If anyone has single-carb on 2.0/1.8 advice, that would be appreciated too.

Thanks! Joe Fournier (back after being a split-snob for a while) ;)
