&gt; Hey George Lyle, this is one for you!
&gt; Now at nearly 227,000 miles, my ORIGINAL 78 engine is still putting,
&gt; although losing a bit of oil (not burning).  I got it at 60K and it ran
&gt; for about 100k with no thermostat (wire off) before I finally went to
&gt; the trouble of fixing it after reading about the need for the flaps to
&gt; be closed until warmup (having joined this list around when it started.
&gt; It's been a daily driver as well as used for trips.  Go figure.   I
&gt; question whether the flaps allow more &quot;uniform expansion&quot;; they allow it
&gt; to get to endstage faster, yes, but blocking air to the heads/cylinders
&gt; should't change the relative rate difference of expansion?

To my knowledge, the function of the flaps is to:

1. ensure quick warmup in all temperatures (even Havasu in summer!)
2. regulate engine temp in outside air temps below 60F or so.

The first is a no-brainer.  The second conclusion I came to after gluing
little pointers to the flap shafts so that I could observe their position.
They seem to go wide open in temperatures above 60F, but they modulate the
flow in temps below that.

Even warm-up?  No data.
