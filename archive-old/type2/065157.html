Subject: type4 valve adjustment and timing

Hello
I have a 74 bus with a 1800cc carburated engine. I would like to
set the valves but the pulley does not have any marks on it.
I removed the inpection plug but could not get my head in there
to see anything. Where are the marks supposed to be on a type4?
I know where they are on a type1, but can't seem to find them
here. Also, the manual says to adjust the intakes to .006 and
the exaust to .008. I had never heard this, and would like some 
opinions on it. Also, which valve is intake and which is exaust.
I am really tired so please excuse my rambling question style.
Thanks
