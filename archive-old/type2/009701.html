Subject: DIY front child's bed to age 11

Since the subject of front &quot;hammock&quot; beds over the front seats has come up,
I'll repost my solution not using this :
Subject: ALTERNATE CHILD'S BED UP FRONT

If you actually want a front bed that'll satisfy the kid to age 11, try this:
Using quality 3/32&quot; ply paneling,  (the mahogany stuff is OK) cut out a
piece that will sit over the front dash,
between the windows (leave 1&quot; gap for curtains), and sit against the
driverseat and turned around passenger seat.   Trace the curve of the
windshield onto cardboard and transfer to the board.  Use cloth tape along
edge to prevent splintering.  I unlocked the turned passenger seat (lift
that pointy tab on the seat along the rail) and slid it more forward, using
a string loop from seat to the release lever that stopped the seat 2&quot;
before it comes off the rails- yes you can sit on it this way!   The front
to back size of the board is determined by this seat back to window.  (Or
you could notch the board for it and size the other side for the distance
to driver seat).  Now cut a frame from 1x1&quot; oak, using two
that span from over the dash to just behind the seat belt to door frame
attachments.  Hang these level via nylon rope or strapping loops that slips
into same slot that seatbelt goes into. (I used nylon sash cord and knotted
it into a loop- also groove the underside of the side spans where the rope
sits so it can't slip out.)   On the driverside, the board slips against
where the headrest starts, I recall). Now span another 1x1 between these 2,
so it rests against the seatback.   I used 2 pieces of steel (cut from
hardware nailing plates for joists), fastened to each side rail (used 3
small screws) so the spanning piece could rest on them and be held via
rounded nails going thru a hole drilled thru span and metal.  In
retrospect, endrilling a hole thru the side span and into the cross span,
and inserting an 8-10 Penny nail would do the same.  These frame pieces I
stored above the closet where cot used to go.  The board stores above right
over the upper Westy bed, along with the 1&quot; foam pad we cut to fit and made
a flannel cover for.
To set up the bed, just turn the seat around, put up the poptop, and take
the 3 framepieces, setting the side pieces up first onto dash and slipping
thru the rope loops.  I also had ground out a bit where it goes over the
dash so it wouldn't slide back.  Fasten the cross span with the 2 nails.
Slide the board off the roof and place onto the frame.  So it wouldn't
shift around, I added 2 nails to each side that went thru board and span
below.  It fits JUST over the steering wheel.   Worked beautifully from
1986 to 1994 (yr of the 6 week x-USA trip), and much more comfy for our
daughter!  Yes, it holds even my 150 lbs, but you get claustrophobic with
the low headroom.  Indeed it would be simpler to cut 2 2x3&quot; and span them
on the door lip between the door windows, but then you couldn't open the
doors to get stuff from the front, where we put a lot of stuff from the
rear when sleeping.
   Now that she's outgrown that, I'll tell you sometime of the 6 foot by
30&quot; bed you can add along the cabinets of a post 77 Westy, spanning right
to the front dash
and back to the rear bed!  MB
