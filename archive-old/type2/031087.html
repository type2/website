&gt; Now that winter is coming, so are the questions about heat. I've been on this 
&gt; list 3 yrs or so, and every year questions come up about Back Seat Heat and 
&gt; even worse, the little dashboard heater. Let me be the first ( I think) this 
&gt; year to say: KEEP YOUR MONEY. They don't work, or at least they don't put out 
&gt; 
&gt; PS- If anyone doubts what I say about the dasboard heater/defroster, I've got 
&gt; one I'll sell you! 

heck I got one I'll give you if I can find where I threw it!

I have a WARM bus, but I finally broke down and put in an auxilary gas
heater.
