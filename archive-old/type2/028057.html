Subject: Fuel tank Venting: 72/77
Message-ID: &lt;ICNOMKNIPADDAAAA_at_theglobe_dot_com&gt;

In converting my '72 to a '77 FI 2-liter, I decided I needed the later fuel tank for the fuel return from the FI system. I picked one up and derusted it. I installed it last night. It was pushing midnight and my lighting isn't that great, so I didn't get to investigate fully, but there is an additional venting tube coming into the area of the fuel tank. That is, '72 buses have an extra, larger tube that attaches at the back, top of the tank. The '77 buses only had 2 small venting tubes in this area.

I think the larger tube comes from the charcoal canister on the stock '72 engine (Type 4, US spec), but that in later FI buses the fumes from this are reintroduced to the FI system. Is this correct? If not, can you tell me how the larger tube connects into the venting system? I need to know if I should plug it, leave it hanging, or in some way tie it back into the venting system.

Thanks for helping me vent! ;-) Joe
