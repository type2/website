Hi Folks,

This may be an extension or combination of several recent threads, but would 
help clarify an issue that I dealt with this weekend.

This weekend I drove from Aspen to Lyons, CO (NE of Boulder) for a small 
campout, and was concerned about my oil temps.  The roads were very fun to 
drive, but this mountainous Colorado country meant that I had to do some 
serious climbing for much of the time.  Many of the summits and passes were 
over 9,000 feet, with one or two as high as 11,000 or 12,000 feet.  I'd hit 
the bottom of a hill with oil temp between 190 and 240 (normal operating 
temp for my Bus), and temp would climb right along with me.  Most of the 
time I'd hit the top before going over 260 (the hottest I dare to run), but 
a few times I had to stop, open the hatch and let the engine idle to cool it 
down.  Even at 260*, though, my oil pressure was good (20-25psi).

So, is there a solution to the climbing oil temps?  Is it worth putting in 
an external cooler?  Can I run cooler by backing off the timing?  Should I 
install an extra engine compartment fan?  Will running my heat booster fan 
help any?

My Bus is a 1979 Std. Westy, 2.0 FI, GE-series engine with no O2 sensor.  
I'm running 20W-50 oil, and have the timing set at 8* BTDC.  I'm pretty sure 
the vacuum system is tight, and my cooling flaps are all the way open.

Thanks for any suggestions...
