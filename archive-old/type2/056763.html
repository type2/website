Subject: RE:  rear hatch - long musing...

&gt;There's something puzzling about this thread. Why would anyone 
&gt;who is concerned about safety allow children to ride in the back 
&gt;anyway? Isn't this illegal in all 50 states by now? (Drunks are another

&gt;matter.)

Good point.  

Caution:  No bus content beyond this point!

I don't have any yet (kids that is), but was just remembering my
childhood days when my parents would load up that big 'ol Ford
Sationwagon (pre gas crunch days) with my brother (David) and me and
drive these all-night 1000 miles trips to visit family and places.  We'd
go to sleep to the hypnotizing effect of headlights going by and then
wake up the next morning in a different world.

Anyway, they'd load as much of the luggage up on the luggage rack as
possible (and being a BIG stationwagon, it'd hold a BUNCH) so the rear
area would be free for David and me to play with our Hot Wheels, our
travel bingo cards, and to pound each other's arms black &amp; blue playing
&quot;slug bug&quot; (buses got you 2 hits - there, I worked buses here afterall).
I guess I was having visions of similar trips in the years to come with
my future family.  

But you're right.  Safety considerations pretty much require that all
occupants be securely tied to their seats now.  Somehow that doesn't
sound like near as much fun as launching yourself back and forth over
that rear seat, desperately trying to stay out of the reach of Dad's
long arm as he says menacingly, &quot;If I have to stop this car, you're
gonna be sorry!&quot;  

Oh well, all things change.  Now I guess you strap 'em in tight, hand
them each a Nintendo Gameboy, make sure the in-car TV and VCR is working
and the headsets are there and forget about them.  It's a whole
different world these days.  At least, that is, until you're 7 miles out
of town and that first little whine breaks in, &quot;Daddyyy!  I gotta
goooo!&quot;.

Personally, I'm in favor of Tobin's suggestion of bungying the kids :-).
