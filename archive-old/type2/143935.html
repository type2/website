Hmmm, were they measuring absolute compression, or were they simply
comparing the compression as each piston goes through its compression
stroke?  IIRC, there was a crankshaft position sensor, so an oscilloscope
record of battery current placed next to a graph showing the crank
position should show four equal current peaks for every two cycles of the
crank position sensor.  If one peak was low, it would be an indication of
a low cylinder.
