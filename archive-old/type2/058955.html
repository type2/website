Subject: Check those fuel hoses!

This caution is for newbies; everyone else has already acted on it.

Yesterday I was replacing fuel line. Got underneath Peregrine, my '76, and
placed a piece of hose between the backend of the pressure valve to the
point where the hose attaches to the fuel tank. Just to check the length.
As I held the hose there, the slight touch caused the old hose to crumble!
And I do mean disintegrate into dust! Suddenly gasoline was running up my
nose -- and everywhere else. It took about a minute to pull myself out
from under the bus, make a plug out of a piece of hose and a bolt, get
back under there, clean the dust from the pipe, and cinch the plug on.
Gasoline everywhere.  My clothes were soaked, and I felt I couldn't go in
and change them until I was sure the gas had evaporated from the concrete
pad. 
 
Let me emphasize: I didn't tug on the old hose, or try to take the clamp 
off. I *lightly* touched it, the way one touches a newborn baby. Then: dust.

So three cautions, really. First, empty the tank if you can before working 
on old fuel hoses. Second, have a fire extinguisher at hand (I did, and I 
am glad I didn't need it).

Third, and most important: unless you have replaced them or had them 
replaced by a reliable mechanic, those hoses under your bus are bomb 
waiting to go off. Search the archives and Josh's library for the 
details, and then replace them.

Don't drive your bus again until you do.
