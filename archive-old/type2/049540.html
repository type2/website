Brad,

The timing on your engine is based on the distributor that is installed.

It should have two #'s on it; a Bosch and a VW part #.  Get the numbers and 
then check out the type2_dot_com library at the link below.  There is a chart of 
just about every distributor used on a VW there.  Distributors seem to get 
mixed and matched frequently as parts wear out so its a good idea to 
determine what you really have.
