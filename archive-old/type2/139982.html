Subject: Re: [T2] wheels and tires in the time of cholera.

&lt;&lt; That is true. If you are trying to maintain the same overall tire height as
stock (which keeps the speedo accurate) but with bigger wheels, this
requires a shorter-sidewall tire  - which will result in a harder ride, all
things being equal. That's the downside to the latest &quot;import tuner&quot; rage,
combining humongous wheels with extremely low-profile tires. They may look
cool (kewl?:-), but driving down the the road your &quot;pimped ride&quot; feels more
like a pimped go-cart. Of course some of these people are putting 20 inch
wheels on a subcompact.  We're not talking about quite the same extreme in
the case of a bus. &gt;&gt;

I got to talk to some guys who run a shop in Da Bronx specialising in that
sort of stuff...Mostly they love it because of the repeat customers...
NYC potholes eat those rubberband tires and mega-buck rims... ;-(
