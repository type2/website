&gt; Two &quot;dumb&quot; questions from a newbie:
&gt; 1.  Where the heck is the brake fluid reservoir in a '78 Westy?

It's in the most logical place:  under the driver's seat.  At least VW
thought that it was logical!

&gt; 2.  Any good stuff about draining and refilling tranny case with
&gt; new gear oil and a dollop of STP.  My shifting has gotten a bit
&gt; cranky.

I've never seen anything good happen with STP.  It certainly won't fix
mechanical problems!  Cranky shifting is usually the fault of the
linkage.  Check the bushings and flexible coupling for play.
 
&gt; Go easy on me..I'm new to this.

We all were at one time.  I still am every time something different
breaks!
