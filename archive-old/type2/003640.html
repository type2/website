&gt; Organized by Ron -Coyote- Lusser, the same person who organized the -Top
of
&gt; the World Tour- back in 1996.

How come he gets all the credit?? AFAIK, the idea was conceived, borne, and
raised by Tobin and Christa out of Vancouver. Ron merely did the website.

Through the grapevine, I heard that the trip turned political, the group
breaking up into various factions. My point? I don't expect Tierra del Fuego
to be a pleasant experience if you're independently-minded and don't like to
be bossed around. Let's not turn this into a thread before Friday.
