&gt;i have recently installed a rotary/electric fuel pump .. 3 1/2 lbs of fuel

&gt;the fuel pump in the top of my engine compartment.. should this be
&gt;acceptable? thanks for the help.. scott
==========================&gt;
Pumps do not suck .... Period.
Their design may be such that they can still have acceptable inlet fuel 
flow at some pressure less than 14.7 psi (1 atmosphere), but they all still 
require adequate NPSH in order to maintain prime under proper flow operation.

I suspect your pump does require a positive head to prime itself.
On the other hand, it may require positive head to prime, and yet still be 
designed such that it will continue with proper performance with inlet 
pressures less than 1 atmosphere.

Without knowing exactly what you have, my answer will be a guess.
Can you call the manufacturer?
