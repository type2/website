&gt; Folks,
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone know of any video's that show more than just a brief snippet
&gt; of any shots inside a vw factory...anything that shows them actually
&gt; making a bug or bus?

A few years back VW put out a video called &quot;the Volkswagen story&quot; that was
free for anyone who asked.  I don't know if they still have it or not.  It
had lots of shots of the factory.

The History Channel also has a video that covers the history of the bug.
They air it about every two months.
