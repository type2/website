&gt; well i was asked earlier if the engine would turn if i turned the bolt through the back witha ratchet...

has it turned since you put it back in the bus??
I suspect something is hung up on your flywheel,, pull it out check
closely and see if it will turn while out of the bus, if it does then it
is probably something in how you put it in...
 
&gt; am i doing this right and please tell me what can this mean and what can i do to fix it,...

it can mean a lot of things, more data please

&gt; i will have a new starter here tomorrow even if this turns out to be another problem she at least will have a starter..

well it probably won't hurt but I bet you don't need a starter


good luck
