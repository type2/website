Subject: NEED HELP (Short Version)

Hello,

Thanks in advance for your much-needed assistance.  I have a 1974 VW Westy
with a 2.0L, Carb, Pancake Engine.  If you went to Everybus, its the orange
one with the University of Florida Tags and Gator Sticker.

Decided to clean the heat exchangers.
Drove Bus onto ramps to get room underneath.
Taking off heat exchanger and 2 nuts came off with 1/2 the bolt leaving
other 1/2 in heads
  Tried WD-40, Liquid Wrench, Propane Torch, Vice Grips, etc... no luck.
Cleaned and painted heat exchangers (used Rust-O-Leum High Heat Paint)
Put it all back together (minus 1/2 of two bolts).
Drove off ramps and cranked bus.
  LOUD!  LOUD!  LOUD!  Oh yeah, and it backfired a lot.  Especially after
hold throttle, let off, backfire.
  Puffing exhaust out from the cylinder where the bolts sheered off.  Also,
seems to be cooking my paint.
Feeling pretty bad and typing letter to Type2 friends for help.

QUESTIONS!
1)  How do I get the bolts out?
2)  Where do I get new ones (threaded on both sides, plain in the middle)
3)  Why is it backfiring?
4)  What kind of paint should I have used?
5)  Is the Bus safe to drive like this?
6)  Is there any easier way to learn how to work on your own VW? (Can I get
a tutor?)

Thanks,

Darrin K. Pierce
