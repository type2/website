Subject: '76 FI westy

Hello all,
    Today, I bought a 76 pop top westy.  The clutch is shot, and I need
to replace it.  Can any of you send me pointers on removing a FI engine?
I have removed and installed a 1700, so the pancake engine is not new to
me, but the FI parts are.  If any of you would like to give m pointers
on the FI system, like what to look for, common problems and the
solutions, I sure would appreciate it.

BTW, this makes 7 busses in my yard, and my wife does not even mind.
What a great woman she is. I am trying to sell a few of them.

Thanks,
