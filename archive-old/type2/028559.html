&gt;If it is positioned wrong, you simply lift it up off of its mating gear,
&gt;rotate it, and drop it down in the correct position.  The
&gt;complicating factor is that it takes a special tool to get hold of the
&gt;drive gear.


You can pull the drive out of the engine with a blunt end #2 pencil.

I bought one of those magnets with the telescoping handles. With a little
twist it pulls right out.
