Subject: seat mounting bolts


Someone recently posted to the list that they were now carrying middle seat
mounting hardware. But I can't seem to find it at any of the vendors that
frequent the list. I tried searching the archives but the &quot;most recent 1000
posts&quot; search doesn't seem to work at all, and the older archives pulls up
peoples requests for this hardware.

Also, what years were full width solid back middle seats available? I can
only seem to find the 1/3-2/3 folding back wide middle seat upholstery.

Thanks
