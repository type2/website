Subject: Re: [T2] What colour green


&gt; &gt; I always refer to it as &quot;babyshit&quot; green.....first thing I did when I got
&gt; &gt; my 78 was paint it a different color.....isn't any wonder they didn't
&gt; &gt; sell more of em, the colors were horrible the last couple years
&gt;
&gt;Same here.  I went for one of the older greens, much easier on the eyes.
&gt;The official name for that colour is 'Taiga Gruen' - there is no way that is
&gt;the colour of Taiga.  I think the marketing people must have been sniffing
&gt;cans of the stuff.

Yeah we've got a &quot;former&quot; Champagne Edition Westfalia. There was so much 
brown we referred to it as the &quot;Cow Poop Edition&quot;.

It is now (VW  Golf Tornado) red and white outside and undecided inside - 
BUT - the dash now is a boring, neutral two tone black and grey. Colors 
that we like, not original obviously.

Of course it can all go back to brown on brown on brown if they are 
suddenly valuable in those colors.
