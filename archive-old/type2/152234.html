&gt; Sure, sunroofs were available on Kombis and normal Microbuses
&gt; too.  I listed the Sunroof Deluxe Microbus as a seperate model
&gt; due to its additional eight skylights.  Makes it a different
&gt; model in my book.

as you start spliting hairs, are the 21 window and 23 window splities
differnt models.  since one has the corner windows the other doesn't??
