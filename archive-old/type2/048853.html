Be careful about using nail polish remover though!  for some reason women
object to applying industrial solvents to their fingers, so the
manufacturers of the nail polish removers often add oils to the acetone to
&quot;condition&quot; the skin.  These oils aren't all that good if you plan on
putting new film on the windows!

Check the bottle carefully, or just buy the stuff at the local hardware
store paint department.
