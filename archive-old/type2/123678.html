Subject: Re: BN4 fuel line route

Peter,
Is your rig fuel injected?
The fuel line for carbureted usually goes over the tranny (with clips to
hold the hose to the top of the tranny tunnel) and through the firewall on
the driver's side of the engine.
In my experience the T for the fuel lines has been just in front of the
firewall when I get the vehicle with both lines going through the firewall.
There may be a functional reason that was done but on my installs I place
the T in the engine compartment, usually under the heater.
