Yes! By all means, top it up! Another thing that might help is adding a
part bottle of auto trans seal conditioner. I've never tried it on a
steering box, but it sure works on transmissions. Makes the seals soft
again. And really you have nothing to lose. Running low on grease is
sure to wear it out rapidly.

So how does one top off the steering box?  Does it have to be removed?
