&gt;&gt;      Next The same bus has a tighter steering box than
&gt;&gt;mine and I would like to know if they are compatable. The guy
&gt;&gt;said he'd sell it for $25 if I pull it, and looking at the
&gt;&gt;prices of rebuilt ones in RMMW (~ $280) this seems like
&gt;&gt;a steal.

&gt;I'm not sure about this, but I seem to remember that the steering box
&gt;changed around '73.

I second this. The box changed to a worm-and-roller design for '73. Worm
- -and-peg for '68-72 (only four year production, hence the scarcity and high $.
Kind o' like those low front turn lenses =:-0    ). Might be worth the $25 to
find out if they're interchangeable, tho. I took the easy way out and bought the
rebuilt.
