Chris Mills sends:

&gt; By the way - for those folks who get the Eastwood Company catalog. I've
&gt; heard good things about the home style kit they sell but the cost of the
&gt; kit far outweighs the cost to have a batch done professionally. Not to
&gt; mention you need some way to cure the powder which normally is an oven. At
&gt; my house my wife would be quite suspicious of car parts going into the
&gt; oven. And a bumper doesn't fit in my oven anyhow! &lt;grin&gt;

Once you cure powder coating in your oven you have a Powder Coating Curing
Oven--you can't cook food in it ever again. Which really pushes up the price
of the Eastwood kit.
