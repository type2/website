I have seen that several people have this under window rust problem. If
anyone need the section that goes under the windshield, I have a donor
Bus(73) that it is in great shape.  Can cut down as far as you want, but if
shipped the price will go up as it gets bigger. The benefit to good used is
that it is the same German steel, same gauge, and you get the inner panel as
well.

Serious to the point of penetration. Now water is available to the iron
kept well satuarted under the floor mat. This is the entropy of the
universe. Water+air+iron=rust. 

Decide now whether to fix this chassie or get another. Rust repair of the
under windshield will easily cost less than half as much as adding floor
and step repair just a few years later.

For what it's worth, I have the very same problem with my '72. I'm still
trying to find a good German windshield before I fix this. 

A very decent cared for 71 Westy will be available here soon. More info by
pmail if interested. I will be repairing his new '72 2.0L Westy next week.
