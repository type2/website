Subject: Re: [T2] Using tire paint on worn out floor mats

The outfit's who make the tire black is Parko, or USC.

And no Tony-----( who asked if Bullet proof is the brand name )--just
plain ole tire black--

Good to know!!! 
Thanks. 
Forget the black die, it is a lacquer product and unless the surface it
is to be applied to is squeaky clean it WILL come off. Whereas Tire
Black can be applied to almost any surface and is bullet proof. 
I have been using this stuff for years on the rubber floor mats in Mack
trucks , as well as the tires after I've painted the wheels. It doesn't
come off---- 
Its available at most any of your better body shop supply store---
