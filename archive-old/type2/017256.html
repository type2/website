mine for 7 or 8 years and could definitely see some degradation inside.
This is why they are not DOT legal and what DOT is protecting us from by

making us use sealed beams. Sealed beams are mediocre, but at least they

won't get worse! &quot;

Point of comparison: One of my buses came equiped with a pair of (DOT
approved) Sylvania halogen sealed beams, on which the tain had likewise
worn out.  I have no idea how old they were; but I  sent 'em back to
Sylvania, who replaced them without question, asking only for one of the
defective bulbs too examine.  I can't say how much of an improvement the
halogens sealed beams are over the regular sealed beams, as I installed
them as a pair.  If anyone is interested, I'll install one of two on
another bus today, and compare them tonight.
