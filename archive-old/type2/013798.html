We do apologize for this recurring and irritating problem. It happens 
when we move IPs. We have to move IPs a lot lately. It will stop when 
our new server is ready. Our new server is not ready yet.

It is possible to work around the problem in this way: run a search, and 
the search engine will return your results. If you see a result that 
looks promising, its URL will look something like this:

	http://216.166.222.133/archive/type2/018870.html

To see the actual message, replace the string &quot;216.166.222.133&quot; with the 
string &quot;216.166.222.132&quot; -- so the example above would become:

	http://216.166.222.132/archive/type2/018870.html

That string with the numbers in it is the numerical address of the 
type2_dot_com server, and it may change again. If it does I'll try to post 
the new one. I don't know when the new server will be ready and this 
slow torture will stop.
