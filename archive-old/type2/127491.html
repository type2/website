Subject: Re: [T2] insurance, Geico, radar guns

I'm sure this thread will be killed soon the way it is
going, so all I was going to say is that I use Geico -
with my Bus listed as a second vehicle, they charge me
around $13 a half for liability (my primary vehicle is
around $120/yr. for liability only).  Oh, and I do own
a radar detector, and I don't use it in the Bus...
