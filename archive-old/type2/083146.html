Matty,

The general rule is that if you are running a stock bus, the timing
setting for the stock distributor runs fine with regular gas.  I know you
have been around the list long enough to have been thru half a dozen
cycles of distributor posts, so I know that you know timing setting
depends on distributor model and that, depending on model, it can be 7.5
before to 5 after TDC.  Also, depending on where you live, regular gas can
be either 87 octane (below 5,000 feet) or 85 (above that).

If you are running a high compression engine, then you will need to run
higher octane gas or retard the timing to prevent knock/ping.

If you are running an mechanical advance distributor, you *may* need to
advance your timing to attain adquate advance at cruising RPMs.

For your '76, if you have the vacuum/mechanical dist, the timing should be
set at 7.5 BTDC _at_ 800 RPM and should advance to ~40 BTDC at 3,000 RPM. It
should run fine on 87 octane gas below 5,000 feet altitude.
