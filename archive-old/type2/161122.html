&gt;About the only quirky thing I've found

Try watching the tire store employee fumble around before he breaks something.

&gt;My mini is even stranger - you pull up on
&gt;the gearshift lever to put it into reverse.

Saab has had this for years.

&gt;How many car thieves out there know that to start a Mazda
&gt;Rx-2 with a cold engine requires pulling the choke and giving the gas
&gt;pedal two quick pumps (no more, no less) as it's turning over?

RX-2 thieves? You might have a vagrant break in and sleep in your car especially if you left your bong on the seat but no one is going to steal that car. :-)
