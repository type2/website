&gt;       Transmission work needed. Does not go except in reverse. To be

Geez-o-Pete!  If Ron hasn't jumped all over this one, someone should.  I 
know where you can get a tranny out of an '82 for $200 (plus shipping) 
[that is, if it hasn't sold in the last couple of weeks].  Why couldn't 
have this one been in St. Louis or something?  :(
