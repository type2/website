I've been informed of a 1978 Westy Deluxe, 88k miles, original owner,
&quot;fully restored&quot; (and in Louisiana)

The current owner is fishing for offers, but claims to have turned down
$10,500;  I guess that this indicates that he's looking for something in
the neighborhood of $12k (or more).

Does this seem reasonable to folks here?  Should I take the time to go
all the way to LA to see this?  Any thoughts, opinions, ideas?

Thanks, 

Marty Wallace, 1984 Westfalia &quot;Heisenberg&quot;
