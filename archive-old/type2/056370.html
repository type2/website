Subject: My Axle Fell Off  #^*)(&amp;&amp;#!!!!!

This is a new one on me!!  I'm sorta new to the bay window scene even though I've been into VW for 20 plus years.   And today was a first, I was crossing an intersection when all a sudden Bang!!  The bus no go, thou I do admit it coasted well,  I was frantic, for we are to leave on vaction tomorrow.  The clutch felt good, the engine puttered happliy, so I coasted into the closet parking lot.  My youngest daugther Sam informed me that something black came off the bus and was laying in the road.  I jumped out and looked under the bus, to my suprize the drivers side in board CV joint was hanging down.  Needless to say I knew what the black thing in the middle of the road was and was able to talk my wife in to fetching it, while I unburied the tool box.  I always wondered why I carry that 12 torx bit around, now I know.  I was able to steal a bolt here and one there and get things back together for the trip home.  Tomorrow both axles get new lock washers and torqued if I can find !
the specs in the Bentley.  Why they decided to loosen up is beyond me, I mean, this has never happened to any of my bugs, my vanagon, or my other three bay windows.  I've always just tighten the bejebers out of them.  Go figure?  Maybe it was because I had a brand new shirt on!!
Peace, Love, and at least Albert did this close to home!
