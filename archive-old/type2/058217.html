Subject: Re: '68 to '76 Sliding Door Transplant-Will it Fit?

[This message was posted by a non-subscriber. Please reply to the

&gt;    I have a chance to buy a sliding door from a '68 bus to replace the rusted one on my '76 Westy. Question is, are they the same size, and is the hardware the same? I'm hoping someone out there has tried this before, and knows if it will fit or not. 
&gt; 
I put a 68-71 sliding door on my 78 this spring. I had to use the early handle and !IMPORTANT! the early catch from the door frame of the donor bus. If the catch is not available becuase the door is already off it will not latch. That was the only issue.
I can't seem to lock mine (I do have the key) but i think it is an issue with the old early handle rather then an installation issue.
