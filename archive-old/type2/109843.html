&lt;&lt; Now, on the few occasions that I drive the Bus at night, I've noticed that

there is MAJOR condensation buildup. The top of the motor even becomes

soaked with water. At first I thought it was fuel and got worried. The

carburetor and everything is almost cold to the touch. In theory, this would

tell me that it's REALLY cold and that I'm probably getting better

horsepower.. but do you guys forsee any problem with this? &gt;&gt;

Why better horsepower?
You want vaporized fuel not condensed droplets that a cold inlet would
indicate. The type 1 engines (1600 uprights) have a heat riser pipe for
a reason...Racers (road course/drag) use various ways to cool the in-
take 'charge' (cold air ducting, fuel lines running thru' dry ice boxes)
to create a denser (more molecules to the cubic inch) mixture on the
intake side of the carb/FI...
