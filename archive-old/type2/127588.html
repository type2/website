Subject: RE: [T2] installing new rubber lines?

Probably a little spit would be best, or gasoline might help. Don't use motor oil or automotive grease, that stuff can cause some kinds of rubber to rot and soften...not what you want at the connection points for your new fuel lines.

Hi,

I have bought the kit from Collie and Scott (www.germansupply_dot_com) and am
trying to figure out the best and easiest way to assemble it.

Can I use a lubricant to put it together???
