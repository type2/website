Phil,

I don't know about eastern Canada, but I've never found GL 4 80W90 oil at 
Canadian Tire in Alberta, North of the border here in Montana.  I can get 2 
gal ( 7.5 l) jugs of GL 4 at the local farm and ranch supply place for less 
than $10 U.S.  Suggest you try a farm supply store which caters to &quot;real&quot; 
farmers and ranchers.  They may be able to help you.  I've also found GL4 at 
NAPA, I think the brand is STA-LUBE, in quart and gallon bottles.

Good luck.
