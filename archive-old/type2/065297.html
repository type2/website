Subject: Camper Windows

Hello All,

Just started reading this list a while back.  Anyway, after working on my 
bus Saturday, I parked it in my apartment parking lot.  Came out to 
drive it to the VW show in San Jose on Sunday to find one window 
pulled out of the frame.  Some !_at_#$%* broke in and stole some tools.

What's done is done, so now I'm looking to repair the damage.  These 
are the camper windows that are hinged on the top and have a rotary 
crank in the middle of the window to open.  I've seen these on 
occaison around the SF Bay area, but not in any catalogs or stores.  Any ideas 
on where to look for parts (before turning to a junkyard or parts 
bus)?  Also, is it possible to replace these with another type of 
window?

Thanks,

Greg Payne
