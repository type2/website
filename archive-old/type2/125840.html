Subject: [T2] rubber plugs for brake backing plate

Denny --- This morning I visited with a guy I had met via email in the VW 
Diesel group.  He owns a store featuring equipment and supplies for home-
brewing of beer.  He has &quot;bung sealers&quot; that might be just right for your 
needs -- looked to be about 5/8&quot; diameter for sealing the inspection holes.

My other suggestion would be someplace like Radio Shack, where you could buy 
rubber grommets of the appropriate size.  Yes, these have holes in the middle; 
but before you install them, you could place them on a sheet of waxed paper and 
fill the openings with silicone rubber, for example, from a caulk tube.  Low 
cost approach -- might be worth a try ;-))
