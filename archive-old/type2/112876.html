i made a post on an engine pull thread that you might be speaking of and 
since then there have been some things that I have considered.  one was 
if you're buying a jack for the exclusive purpose of engine pulling it 
seems like this is the way to go, especially in light of success 
stories.  some things I would look for are ones that are low to the 
ground.  the one in the motor cycle cruiser article is 5.1 inches high, 
which is pretty good compared to the 3 ton trans jack that sits 6 inches 
off the ground that I've been using.  when it comes down to wheeling 
that engine out from under the engine bay, the lower the better, 
otherwise tyou'd have to put the bus on stilts.  and of course the jack 
should go high as well.  it says the average for these jacks is 21.8 
inches so i don't know if that is good enough or not.  sounds like 
plenty though.

also if you're willing to do the work i don't think it's hard to get 
these jacks used, even locally.  just dip into the ATV/motorcycle 
community to see if you can get a bargin.
