Subject: Child's cot
Date: Tue, 2 Mar 1999 12:34:10 +0100 

I drive a European spec 1600 72 westy and am wondering if anyone has plans
on how to construct the child's cot that fits over the driver's seat? I
would be really thankful for the help.  I have the snap holes for the front
window covers and if there are plans out there to make the curtain, I would
appreciate it.
