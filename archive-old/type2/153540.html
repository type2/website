  Subject: [WetWesties] OTP - Electric bike conversions when camping etc.

  &gt; I realize this is somewhat off topic, but who better to ask than a
  &gt; bunch of campers that by their badge of vehicle ownership pretty
  &gt; much say &quot; let's take the road less travelled&quot;, or else, are into
  &gt; tinkering.
  &gt; I've been keeping my eye on the price of gas when commuting, and
  &gt; let's be frank; it ain't gonna go down. Mr Harper up here in
  &gt; Canada, and Mr. Bush are NOT going to give up their lifestyle by
  &gt; giving me a break on gas, so I'm looking at commuting much more
  &gt; cheaply. The latest Electric bike conversions utilizing a hub
  &gt; motor are indeed starting to look good. With claimed distances of
  &gt; 30Km on a charge at up to 32Kmp/H I'm definitely interested. Does
  &gt; anyone have any real world experience with one of these? I would
  &gt; especially like to know if I can really just sit back and the let
  &gt; the bike climb a hill for me, while I wave royally at the people
  &gt; sweating it out to make the same incline? :-)
  &gt; Curiously yours,
  &gt; Courtney
