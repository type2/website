Wil,
Forget the soup, Slick 50, STP, and the other oil enhancer's which
promise the world fantastic results--engines n Ice blocks
starting--running throwing sand in the engine--running with no oil pan
and a garden hose on the lower end-it's all garbage--

However--
I would highly suggest you try Marvel Mystery Oil--
It is a high detergent additive--keeps the rings &amp; lifters clean and
spinning free--
and will keep the inside of your engine squeaky clean--and a clean
engine--is a happy engine--

Added to your gas it will keep the injector's clean and lubricate your
valve train--which is really a good idea to do when you go on a road
trip--especially with an air cooled engine--

I use it--love the stuff--it's even good on toast--

Later,

Terry

oil stabilizers, Slick 50, etc.??? Reply to: vanagon_at_yahoogroups_dot_com
Hi,
Just wondering about experiences using engine oil stabilizers to
keep oil in the system where it belongs.  When my engine has sat for
long period it sound loud on startup until the oil gets into the
lifters after a few seconds.
Also, does anyone have any positive stories to tell about additives
like Slick 50 or other additives designed to reduce friction?
.....engine run cooler? engines last longer between rebuild?
Sincerely,
