Subject: web page finally ready

Hey all,
Just wanted to let you all know that my new improved website is finally
ready.  I think.  Go check it out and if anyone finds any errors or bad links
let me know.  It should be good to go though, I just checked it out.

I've got some pictures of my bus as well as lots of good links, etc.

The address is:

http://www.mwc_dot_edu/~sbart7kb/mybus.htm

Enjoy!

Sean
