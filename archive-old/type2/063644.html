&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't list them in their catalog, but I haven't called them yet.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Are these really scarce?  Should I expect it to be a dealer only item?
&gt; &gt; &gt; Anybody have any other recommended sources?

&gt; &gt; I saw some advertised in J.C. Whitney. Don't know how they work though.

&gt; J.C.Whitney tends to be generic in their merchandize (See: &quot;One Size Fits All&quot;).
&gt; I'd be wary about purchasing something like this from them.  Even after the
&gt; technician assures you over the phone that it will fit your model.  BTDT.

Don't pay any attention to the California fruit and nut crowd. I've bought a lot of 
parts from JCW that work fine.
