&gt; I ordered parts from busdepot_dot_com.  Have received a partial
&gt; shipment.  Its now 2 weeks without receiving the rest of my
&gt; order.  I paid for overnight delivery. they have not responded to
&gt; my emails and the invoice htm site is not a site at all. Http
&gt; error.  what can I do????

We filled a lot of backorders this week due to an overdue Motorworks order
finally coming in.  I'd like to check your file but you didn't mention your
name in your post and my system can't pull up your file by e-mail address
alone. Please e-mail me your name (directly to me at busdepot_at_email_dot_com) and
I'll let you know what's up.  May be after the weekend, since it's 7:45
right now and I'm about to leave for the weekend.  Odds are your order is
already on its way.
