Subject: What oil - Oh G*d!
Message-ID: &lt;C51ED84B6F47D211917A0000F8BCBD11011F4CA3_at_zcard00g_dot_ca.nortel_dot_com&gt;

Seein' as its Friday and all....

Regarding all the angst about which oil to use here is my take on it.
My van came with a little book, that contains a chart that tells me what oil
I should be using.
So I use what the book says.
Unlike a lot of people on this list, I am of the opinion that Volkswagon
actually did know 
a little bit about Volkswagon engines, and had experience running them from
Siberia to the Sahara.

Of course my van also has cooling flaps, a thermostat, the original
distributor, FI ... 
so I'm a bit of a farout renegade WRT this group.
