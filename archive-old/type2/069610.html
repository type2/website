Subject: What is this carb??????

Hi all
I took off my air cleaner to see exactly what carb I have on my '74 bus. It is a Holly 
2bbl. So I wrote down the numbers on the little metal tag and called my local parts 
store. They said it is a Holly number but they do not have a listing for it. So I called 
3 other stores with the same response. So if any one can help here are the numbers:
        R9677
        1482

This is how the numbers appear on the little metal tag.

On the MOFOCO thread I have ordered lots of stuff from them. At first, last winter, I 
was really impressed with the service. But the last several times I have called they 
have been rather rude. So in the future, I will be giving my buisness to West Coast 
Metric, RMMW, or Bus Boys. I was also a little shocked to find that my localy owned and 
operated parts store carries many of the parts at very reasonable cost.
I am a little paranoid cause I used MOFOCO's rebuilt heads
on my Super Beetle's rebuilt engine.......... Chip
