The sump sender is the best. I have done back to back DYNO testing with both
types on the same engine, and had a 25 Degree fluctuation in readings. The
dipstick sender is heated by the case, as it slides into the dipstick tube.
In our test I used 2 used, and one brand new sender in the sump location and
3 new dipstick styles. They aere all the same.

I then placed the 2 in a pot of boiling water, to do the old fashioned test.
Unbelieveably the dipstick sender was within 5 degrees of the sump style
sender, until the edge of the sender made contact with the pot, which
changed the temp 30 degrees.

We make a sender for the sump area on our large engines that incorporates an
actuation switch for the oil cooler fan, we use a rabbit coolant sensor to
do the job, and place the oil temp sender  adjacent to it, it works great..

&gt; David:
&gt; Just the fact that (cost be damned!) Porsche would use this piece is
pretty good
&gt; evidence that it is up to par, performance wise. (Incidentally, it's used
in
&gt; 912E's as well- a hp 2 liter VW engine used in 911 chassis in 1976 only)

&gt; &gt; The VDO sump plate sender used in the Porsche 914 measures the
temperature

&gt; &gt; this in the past and yet some people still seem to think that this sump
&gt; &gt; sender is somehow inferior to a dipstick sender.
