Subject: Re: Blue  Balls 

Shame on you.....

lately my 78 has had a bearing noise, no biggie, problem was I just
couldn't find what bearing it was!?!?!?   bought a complete set from Ron
at the Depot and started looking for the problem, one wheel at a time,,,of
course the bloody thing was the fourth one I got to,,,pulled the left rear
today and found the end play in the bearings a bit high, so yanked the
half shaft and pushed out the bearings in the stub axle, didn't look too
bad but replaced em anyway....then to the CV joints, one needed a boot but
when I pulled the joint off and started to inspect it, I found every one
of the CV Balls a deep blue!?!?  
   Well I worked many years ago as a machinist and knew what that meant,
HEAT! and plenty of it....fortunately I had a spare CV and stuck it in, it
has silver balls.
   ran out of time so will test drive her tomorrow morning, but everything
felt smooth after I got her back together

3 consecutive Saturdays now changing bearings, none left to do, as though
I didn't have anything else on my schedule  ;8*{

Oh well the fun and games provided by ones VW.

Bob
now if I can find the open circuit in the blang heater wiring!?!?!? before
spring anyway
