Subject: Re: [T2] T3 Engine in a bus??

&gt;Alright, I scored an engine! I traded some parts to a local guy for a 
&gt;running engine out of a squareback. It is a 1600 with dual carbs.  Anybody 
&gt;have any advice about the compatibility of putting this engine into a 72 
&gt;bus, other than sheet metal? I know I'll probably have to fabricate some 
&gt;engine tin, but other than that, CAN IT BE DONE?? Anyone ever done this or 
&gt;heard of it being done??

I &lt;THINK&gt; it is as simple as fitting Beetle tin to the Type III. There will 
be small differences like where the Type III dipstick is.
