Subject: Re: combining 1.7L engine wiht 091 trans and '79FI... will it work?

Volks,

Thanks for all the advice!  I figured I needed to flop flywheels, but am
glad to get confirmation. 

On the '73, a slightly fuller story:

The FI is aready there, and working, on the '78 engine.  Because I was
working the transplant with a dead '79 body sitting right next to the
project, from which I could take anything I wanted, I put the CU in the
stock spot, just took a sawzall and cut the opening, the sheet metal is
already formed for it.  The clip that holds the top of the CU was removed
from the '79 and installed in the '73 as well (again, the positioning
dimples in the sheet metal are there on the '73, just not the clip). Also,
since I had the dead '79, I chiselled the air filter mount off that body
and put it in the '73.  Looks absolutely stock :-)  Gas tank was not an
issue either, just used the '79 tank.  

On a side note... Harmon, how did you mount the decel valve?  I had a late
tank cover and used it, but the mounting arm is missing (and in conflict
with the charcoal canister mount) for the '73

The question I forgot to ask is if the '73 head will need to be drilled
and tapped for the head temp sensor.  I imagine it will, but VW may have
just done them all in large and used a larger bolt in that hole 'til the
head temp sensor was needed (like they stamped in the flat for the FI CU
long before the actually installed any) Anyone with a stock '73 want to go
out and looksee if the screw that holds the tin to the head near the #3
cylinder is bigger than the one near #4?? :-)

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
