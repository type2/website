Subject: RE: [T2] Cryogenics

From: &quot;Jake Raby&quot;

Percryo_dot_com are the guys that do my stuff...

They are located right in my backyard... we have developed an entire program
just for TI, TIV and 911 engines..

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No kidding. So I could just ask for the Raby Special and they would know 
what I am talking about :) Now correct me if I am wrong but you have to have 
everything disassembled prior to treatment. What I mean is I could not take 
a longblock up there and have them throw it in the freeze could I?


Thanks,

Michael Knight
