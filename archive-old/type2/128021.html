Subject: Re: [T2] FIRE! Almost. I'm screwed, need help BADLY!

Sounds like maybe the positive battery cable was
touching metal to metal somewhere causing it to short
out and fry.  This exact thing happened to a bus I was
driving last fall, of course it wasn't a VW bus, it
was a 66 Passenger school bus that is owned by the
YMCA where I work.  All I did was replace the positive
battery lead making sure there were no bare spots
touching anywhere, and the old beast roared back to life...

&quot;So we got into the red VW microbus with the shovels and the rakes and the implements of destruction and we headed on to the police officer's station...&quot;
