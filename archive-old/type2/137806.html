Subject: Re: [T2] Falling dollar and bus parts

Before I made my decision to by my bus, I went to our local wrecking
yard to see what the parts availability was. I saw several bays still
having many of the commonly sought parts. After I bought my bus and
went to the yard to buy a few things, I found he had just sent ALL of
them to scrap metal. He decided there was no money in parts for
anything older than 1985. This dragnet even took all the rabbits I
used to get my jetta parts off of.

This wasn't as bad when scrap metal prices were down, but now they are
up and everyone I talked to is scrambling to clean up their yards
while the prices are still up. There's even a splitty shell and a bay
westy in one wrecking yard if someone feels inspired to rescue them.
If it's not too late that is.

&gt; Correct. Here in Fresno, Calif. the self serve yards are in business for the scrap.
 The vehicles stand out for about 2 weeks in rows. When the time is
up, a new row
 replaces the old one and they all get crushed. Does not matter what
is in the row. A row
 of imports can have any thing in it, from a Benz to a Yugo. To them,
an engine is an engine.
 A row of trucks can have a VW bus or a Caddy Escalade.... when its
time is up, crusher.
 Scrap weight is all it is.  Anything they sell off it is gravy.
