with the tow my little toyota is a hauler:) just pulled my friends bus from 
outside of BOONE to norfolk va with out any problems.I would just ask for 
gas and food and a tow dolly rental (50-70 bucks ). as long as the wife 
doesnt mind me gone for a day or 2. So what part of VA will you be coming 
back too?

Subject: [T2] an urgent Cry for help!

Hello all. I'm in urgent need for someone to help me tow my bus back to 
Virginia. Right now I am in Houston Texas and i can't get my bus back to
Virginia. 
The bus won't make such a long trip  by herself. I can't afford the cost
of a 
transportation service to have my bus shipped back to Virginia and I
don't 
have a truck or trailer so I am in quite a hard place. Im moving back to
Virginia 
on the 27th of this month and I'm franticlly trying to find a way to get
her 
back home. Can anybody help me out? I can provide cash for gas and some
money 
for your efforts. I can't afford much because I'm a very broke college
student 
but i can probably afford between $300-$400. Thank you very much for any

help! Fare thee well-Evan
