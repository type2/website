Subject: cylinder reconditioning and head condition?

Just a quick few questions here, firstly is it possible to have cylinders
reconditioned or is it simply better and more worthwhile to buy a new set?
Secondly when I removed my heads from my 74 1800, there were what looked to
be circular metal shims between the heads and the cylinders.  Are these
standard engine seals or gaskets and do they need to be replaced when
putting everything back together.  Thirdly I've poured solvent into the
intake and exhaust manifolds for both of my heads and there seem to be no
leaks; does that mean that I can simply bolt my heads back on or should I
get a valve and head job anyways.
