Subject: Fridge switches

Hey all,

The power switch for the fridge on my '76 Westy is frozen, fortunately,
permanently on. Does anyone know of a source for these switches? I am looking
for a whole used panel since the battery charger doesn't work either, but I'm
more concerned with the fridge switches since I can just throw the Battery
Tender on the auxiliary battery when I need to.

Thanks,
Doug
