&gt; I just bought a house with a {alas...one car} garage, I'm going to be

FWIW, I have been working on VW's and other things for over 30 years and
still don't have any air tools other than a paint sprayer, and I used
compressed gas for that...

electric tools will get the job done, they work different, I find getting
tangled in a cord or and air hose is still getting tangled, but I figured
that I'm going to need electric there anyway for lights and things I might
as well use only a single medium.  If I had a shop and did a LOT of work I
would use air, but for a single vehicle you can do everything with
electric.

I have a generator and use it to power my MIG welder, use line power for
everything else..

YMMV
