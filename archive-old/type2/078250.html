Subject: re-enforced sidewall tires, recomenations please!

hello all,

so i'm at a loss. can't seem to find  ANY  enforced
tires that will fit my bus. does any one have any
hints, or reccomendations for me, please.

i am looking for a re-enforced sidewall tire with a
somewhat aggressive tread ( i am one of those fools
that likes to go off-road from time to time). also, i
am not rich. thanks in advance. any and all help will
be GREATLY appreciated!
