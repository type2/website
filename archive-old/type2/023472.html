Subject: Brake warning light concerns
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

While driving the 68 today the brake warning light came on. first it 
flickerd, then it came on bright red. the brakes seemed to be functioning 
properly, so I checked and toped off the fluid(only took a bit) it wasn't on 
when I started the truck again, but came on again later. I read through some 
postings in the archives about faulty grounds causing this, but I just 
cleaned the connections at the body and the light on both rear tail light 
assemblies, so I dont think that is the problem. My main concern is that the 
truck is safe to drive as I need it NOW to haul materials to repair my shack. 
Secondary of course is having the light function properly so that I have a 
proper warning switch in case of failure. My feelings from what I have read 
in the archives is that the truck is ok to drive, If you disagree please say 
so. Any ideas on what the cause  may be are appreciated, I don't have my 
bently with me and won't untill tomorrow or the next day. Not sure if its 
relavent but it rained quite hard today for the first time since I've owned 
the truck and one of tha tail lights doesn't have a proper seal due to a wave 
in the body panel from previous accident damage.

Thank you
ronnie
