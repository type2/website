Subject: Re deer damgage &amp; comprehensive ins.

Having seen the post re deer damage on a Westy, I wonder if the list is
aware you can get comprehensive coverage without collision?  Many of us
have older busses that collision is impractical for.  I found out that
National General (thru Good Sam) will let you cover the RV for
comprehensive alone- ggod for damage where you can't go after the other
guey- like deer, branches falling on the bus, or even &quot;vandalism&quot; like
parking lot damage!
   BTW, compared to AAA, the emergency road protection package that Good
Sam offers covers you for as far as it is needed to get your RV to the
proper repair center- even if it's 400 mi!   Westies are RV's- as long as
you have a sink, stove, potty, and bed!
