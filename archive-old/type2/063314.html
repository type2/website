&gt;Splits came in blue, green, white (beige), and a sort of persimmony reddish
&gt;color (as I recall).  I don't remember ever seeing a black one or a red one.

Hey, what exactly is &quot;sealing wax red&quot;? Is that the persimmony color? Is it
almost exactly the color of red primer but with a gloss to it?

I think that's what mine is. Primer, I mean. ;)
