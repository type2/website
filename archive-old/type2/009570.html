I'm not sure how many of us, maybe all?, who at one time or another
have completed a trip or made a repair with duct tape, bailing wire and
a hefty measure of good positive thinking. You know the times, a dark
and lonely night, a strange new sound comes from somewhere. Your heart
skips a beat and you strain your ears and brain to find what's wrong
and hope that it
all stays together. Many times hope is all we have. And many times it
does work. As a group the members of the list must be pretty good at
this considering the newest bus is a 79 and 20 years old.

My friend Susi has helped me fix my bus from time to time, lent a hand
when I needed more then my own two hands or when my arms were not long
enough. Susi's sister Peggy needs our help. Peggy has cancer of the
pancreas that has metastasized (spread) and her doctors have given her
only a short time to live. Any of us who have had a friend or family
member go
through this knows this is a very bad thing. Peggy is going through
chemo and other treatments but its not easy. Everyone is trying their
best but alittle extra help never hurt. Considering how practiced we
all are at using hope, could we all on Saturday (5/29) night at 10:00
pm, eastern time, give a few seconds of hope for Peggy. She is in
Clearwater Florida. Thanks.

Let the long time sun shine upon you
All love surround you
And the pure light within you 
Guide your way home
