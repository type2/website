I know, I know, the best bus cruise control may well be a suitably
sized stick or rock on the gas pedal but....

Has anyone had any luck with an Audiovox CS100 Cruise control unit? I
got one last night and started putting it in. On the good side it has
the capability of NOT using those funky magnets on the drive shaft,
just the tack signal from the coil. It also has a sensitivity setting
for large slow vehicals.

The unit is a can the size of your fist with a three ft cable. Hope to
put it somewhere cool and electrically noise free.

They supply lots of adaptors and washers.

Tried mounting it with its cable running along the stock throttle
cable, NG the tube thru the fire-wall area is welded to the trans
brace.

Tried up front in the pan under the pedals. NG, not a good place to
make good geometry with the gas linkage.

Tonight I will try an added lever on the throttle body to make a side
pull with the cable. Then run cable thru a spare hole next to gas line
and mount the unit near the fuel pump. Thats the plan anyway. 

Hope I do not have to use the magnets!

When you're crusing down the road in the fast lane and you lazily sail past a few hard-driving cars and are feeling pretty pleased with yourself and then accidentally change down from forth to first instead of third thus making your engine leap out of your hood in a rather ugly mess it tends to throw you off your stride....
