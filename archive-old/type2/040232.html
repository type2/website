Subject: FS:  1973 Westfalia camper with  78 FI engine - Seattle

Greeting fellow listees,

This is a wonderful bus. It is incredibly reliable, wonderfully simple
and has more power and better gas milage than my 1991 vanagon!  We love
this bus (his name is Blitz) and will probably shed several tears when he
goes.  My wife and I are selling it reluctantly because I am in medical
school in Seattle and she is in Anchorage AK with my daughter trying to
support me and ends are not meeting.  I need to sell this before the end
of June so I can make tuition payments.  I'm asking $3300.

The details - sorry they are kind of jumbled - this is sort of like
writing an obituary - you don't know where to start or when to end:

 1973 VW westfalia - first half of its life spent in AZ (Sedona) the
rest all over the US and Canada (now in Seattle).  We are the second
owners.  

 Less than 30K miles on 1978 2L fuel injected engine (hydraulic lifters)
installed professionally 1/25/94 in Arlington VA by Auto Motor and Sport.
 No more valves to adjust!

 Body is in good shape - needs paint.  Over $2K in body work completed
last year and primed/sealed for final paint until I ran out of money. 
All work done here in Seattle by the Bug Haus.  Back hatch has been
replaced with a good one but paint does not match.  Rusted out battery
tray was replaced at the time and the back bumper was straightened and
painted.  Would have cost another $1200 to paint it last year.

 Front and rear sway bars - it drives wonderfully
 BN-?? Gasoline belly heater (needs new rubber air bellows)
 Four brand new tyres with a good spare/cover on the nose
 New battery 6 months ago
 Less than 500 miles on new front calipers
 AM/FM/Cassette with  removable faceplate and front/rear speakers
 Extra insulation added in body/floor/poptop roof - we live in AK!
 Roof vent/skylight
 Third eye brake light
 Wired for CB with antenna
 Front vanagon seats with sheepskin covers.  Rear seats fitted with
custom corduroy covers which are removable for washing.  Insulated
curtains all around.
 Original upper cot in the pop top space and the cot which goes over the
front seats.
 New floor with removable carpet
 Driving lights 
 Set of cable chains
 Dark tinted windows
 Bus boys three gauge plate with VDO head temp/oil pressure/volt gauges
 Original rubber mats in great shape
 Custom parcel shelf beneath glove box/nice comfy, wide oak arm rests up
front
 Owners manuals/workshop manuals
 All documentation since we have owned the van (back to 1986) including
the milage log which tells the real history of our lives since 1986.  I
have religiously maintained the van and oil changes have been every 3K.
 Louvered windows (keeps the ventilation going when it rains)
 Original side step under the sliding door
 Engine compartment lock
 New manual water pump for sink
 Yakima bronco brackets mounted on pop top so you can put two sets of
bars up there - front and back. 

I will be taking digital photos as soon as it stops raining (it is
Seattle after all) and so if you are interested,e-mail me at
Roverini_at_juno_dot_com and I can answer questions and send pics.

Thanks,

Adam and Karyn Grove
