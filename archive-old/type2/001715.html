         Wow. Was it windy here yesterday or what? (Southern Ontario).
Driving the bus home from work was the most white knuckled ride
I ever took. Met a transport on the highway doing about 55mph and I was
pushed by the blast 6 feet toward the ditch. This was followed
by a 30 min drive to the Southwest with the wind gusting to 100kph
from the Northwest. I monitored my new engine oil temp gauge and it never
went above 180 degrees F.
One car after following me and watching me swerve in the gusts,
passed me on the Farr left!
 Anyone else have &quot;fun&quot; driving their bus yesterday in the wind?
