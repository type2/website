    Oh, you're absolutely correct. It can make tremendous differences,
in fact exhaust tuning is a whole science unto itself. It's rather
amazing what can be done with pipes when you really look into it a
little. I think the 2-strokers have really taken this to a fine art, but
4-strokers are pretty affected as well. Makes a difference in engine
life as well -- bad muffler or leaking exhaust manifold (header) gasket
can burn a valve in a very short time, especially with the short systems
VW's have.
