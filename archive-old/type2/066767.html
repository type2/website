Subject: Re: VW bug in Lake Erie

About the sunken bug:

The bug, stripped to just the shell, was sunk in 20 feet of water off of =
Port Clinton, OH, a year ago. It is part of a project by the American Nat=
ural History Museum in NYC, NY. The idea was to show the effect of exotic=
 species (invaders) introduced into an environment: zebra mussels in the =
Great Lakes. The bug was sunk so these zebra mussels will grow on it. Whe=
n it was pulled out, biologists estimated that over 1 millon mussels had =
attached themselves. Since these are juvenile mussels, and less than 1/8 =
inch long, two weeks ago divers attached some adult mussels to the bug. I=
f the project had 2 to 3 years to leave the bug in the lake, it would hav=
e been completly encrusted in adult mussels, turning it into a real VW Bu=
g Mussel Car! You can see the Mussel car next year in an exhibit.
