I have the exact same problem, though mine doesn't seem to overheat.  Sami,
what distributor are you running?  Mine has a 009 and I wonder if it could
be at fault.

&gt;The FI troubleshooting page does not seem to contain an answer for this
&gt;particular problem. The cold engine will start without fuss and idle
&gt;smoothly, but when I tap the accelerator it almost stalls before picking up
&gt;speed. Once warm, this problem goes away.
&gt;
&gt;The aux. bypass valve seems to be fine in the sense that it is open when
&gt;cold (I did not check whether it closes when warm, but idle speed does not
&gt;increase once the engine is warm). EGR is permanently shut off, so that
&gt;couldn't be a source of problems. Couldn't find any vacuum leaks either
&gt;(which doesn't mean there aren't any). Distributor advance mechanism is not
&gt;binding. Engine seems to have a tendency to overheat and I suspect lean
&gt;running, but have yet to test fuel pressure and bench-test the injectors.
&gt;
&gt;Any ideas? :)
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
&gt;Sami
