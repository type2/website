Subject: [T2] Running a motor without tin

We have a 1800cc long black that appears to be in running order 
despite what the PO said about it.

The motor was stripped of it tin, fan housing, intake, exhaust and 
tinware. We want to test it and have a bell housing and a starter to 
bolt it to. We can score an intake manifold, carb and exhaust. We are 
considering trying to run it for a short period without the tin in 
place while on the stand. Can this be done safely and if so for how 
long? Seconds or minutes?

I have been advised that we can run it for about 10 or 20 seconds 
without doing any damage. Has anyone tried this before.
