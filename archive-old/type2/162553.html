&gt; My '71 Camper's engine *died*.  A piston rod cracked in half and was driven
&gt; into the case!  So, I'm considering my options (in no particular order):
&gt;
&gt; 1- rebuild an engine myself

$ 500-800

&gt; 2- pay to have an engine rebuilt

$ 1,200-1,800 be carefull who rebuilds the engine

&gt; 3- buy a turn-key engine

$ 2,500+ if you can find one

&gt; (I haven't considered who, including myself, should do the installation.)

installation is the easy part

&gt;
&gt; I have committed to keeping the Camper, even though it needs much work.  I
&gt; need to pick the engine I can live with for a while.  I like the idea of a
&gt; 1600, but hate the performance.  I like the idea of a high-performance
&gt; engine, but hate the cost.

maybe consider a type 4 engine. even a 1700 is a major improvement

&gt; Perhaps a 1600 dynamically balanced and blueprinted?
&gt; Perhaps a FI longblock (aircooled), maybe dynamically balanced and
&gt; blueprinted?

I think dynamically balanced is a must.  blueprinted is $$$$$$

&gt; Perhaps a suggestion from someone who's got a clue?

stay far away from GEX,

&gt; Reliability is priority #1, with performance #2.
&gt; -David

1. reliability stick with the type 4 block and do it stock

or

2. do  what ever floats your boat but the more you do the less likely you
will have #1


YMMV

good luck
