Subject: [T2] &quot;Ambulance&quot; fans installed

Some of you may have seen Greg Potts' recent note about selling his
breadloaf &quot;ambulance&quot; fans (so called because they give a fan boost to the
fresh air vents a la splitty ambo fans, but they're not really ambulance
parts - really &quot;fresh air fans&quot;).  I've seen these in the &quot;supplemental
wiring diagram for 70-72&quot; in my otherwise mostly useless Clymer manuals
for years and always wondered what they were.

Anyhoo, I was high bidder and got the fans the other day.  Perfect working
condition and in very good shape (nicely packed for shipping by Greg).  As
my photo is next to the definition of &quot;instant gratification&quot; in the
Revised Standard Guide to Psychological Disorders, despite the
fact that it's January I went ahead and put them in tonight, partly
assisted by Ron Van Ness's writeup (see type2_dot_com, &quot;Ness-Tek).

They install very easily.  Although they're supposed to hook into
unassigned fuse #7 on my 71 westy and from there into the 30 circuit
(unswitched), it was easier to piggyback them onto the back of my
non-working rear defogger's switch.  That's a 15 (switched) circuit, but I
don't think I'll be using the fans with the car off anyway.

Ron's article shows the switch being installed next to the headlight
switch to the left of the steering column, but as that spot's taken up on
my bus (toggle switch bypassing bad ignition circuit in key switch), I put
the fan switch in a hole to the right of my lighter (hole pre-drilled in
metal behind the vinyl).

When I first fired them up I was disappointed in the meager air flow.
Then I realized I had to open the vents (blue knobs).  Whoosh!  Feels like
AC right now, since ambient temps are in the low 50's. ;-)  But it'll be a
great thing even in summertime - and I can put aside the clip-on dash fan
I've been using to keep from expiring at stoplights.

Serious air flow, and the installation looks factory.  Only mod is
drilling a hole in the duct cover plate (see Ron's article) for the wires.

These are rare puppies but well worth looking for!
