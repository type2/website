Subject: Make your own engine stand

Hi all:

A couple of years ago I rebuild 2 Vanagon engines, using a regular (American
iron, V8) engine stand that I bought for $10 at a garage sale plus a piece
of 1 1/8&quot; plywood.

I cut a large square of plywood and attached that to the engine stand.  Cut
a fairly large circle (5&quot; diameter??) in the middle of the plywood for
access to the flywheel end of the crank.  Drilled holes in the plywood where
the engine bolts up to the trans and they sawed &quot;slots&quot; from the sides of
the plywood to these holes; these &quot;slots&quot; allowed me to slide the two halves
of the engine together while the case was attached to the stand.  I also
ended up cutting some holes in the plywood (2&quot; diameter??) right near the
forward pistons to give me freer access to those piston's piston pins.

For &quot;sanitation&quot; I then taped all cut edges with duct tape as well as the
face of the board.

This setup worked fine for assembly and disassembly.  When I wanted to work
with the engines in the stand with they flywheel attached I added short
pieces of PVC pipe, notched to clear the flange in the bellhousing mating
surface, as &quot;standoffs&quot; that allowed me to rotate the crank.
