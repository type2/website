Subject: Re: [T2] Sunroof idea's for 71 bus

So, I've been thinking about making my own rag-top cover
&gt;for it and thought I'd ask around and see if anybody here has done that and 
&gt;could give me some pointers about materials, etc.

I too have a 71 poptop westy and am thinking about doing the exact same 
thing. Are there not aftermarket sunroof assemblies available? I think i'd 
rather buy something that I know would fit then to try making something 
myself.  If you do try what you are thiinking with snaps I'll be very 
interested in how it works out, may go that route myself.
