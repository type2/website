X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Hello all,
  I know this discussion has taken place before, so I am not wanting to
rehash that. I called a Salvage yard and talked to a guy about a cylinder
head. This place is a VW/Audi only yard. After telling him what I wanted
(type 4 head) he promptly told me that they are all junk and that I should
put an upright Bug motor in the Bus. He offered to do the convertion for
something like $2500. I said no thanks, but then asked a few questions. I
will call him Bob also. Bob said that he did it for &quot;simplicity and
reliability&quot;. O.K., what do you do about the gap around the engine I asked.
He said&quot;nothing, It dosn't need it&quot; I asked how he keeps it cool, He said
&quot;they run over 100,000 miles and never have a problem keeping cool, air just
exits around the Bug tin&quot;. He also said he uses 1641cc P's&amp;C's for more
power. He has put them in Vanagons and Buses. 
  Now I think that &quot;Bob&quot; is smoking some wild stuff! He just drops in a Bug
motor and runs them like that. He said the power is not bad, just a little
slower(I Bet!!!), and they do just fine. He claims that his VDO gauges say
its cooler than the pancake motor and all sorts of other stuff I did not
buy.
  So whats up with this guy?? Is any of what he said true? I would never do
this on any bus I had, I want all the cooling tin at a minimum if I did, not
just the Bug tin. 
  Any thoughts?
