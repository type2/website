These relays are silver canisters that are available at RV stores for about
10 bucks.  Cheaper than the &quot;isolators&quot; and work better too.

So I wrote:
OK, I've also got a '78 auto tranny camper with disconnected aux battery and I
want to get it back online, if only to have a second battery available to 
start this auto tranny beast (which can't be push started). I've read some on
the subject and thought an isolator was better than a relay in term of 
reliability and in terms of meting out current as needed to each battery
rather than just indiscriminantly giving 'em both juice. The VW manual my bus 
came with has spooky, vague warnings like,'Running the 'frig off the aux battery
may occasionally drain your main battery too,' as if even VW was hedging on the 
effectiveness of their stock relay at isolating the aux battery circuits from
the main.

So what's the deal as you understand it Dave? Why is a relay better than an 
isolator? My dad, the old boat guy, says that the most efficient solution would 
be to have a big marine switch to toggle back and forth from A to B battery
combined with a memory good enough to switch it regularly. The diode isolator
uses about 5% of the juice from alternator to function, but relieves the owner
of need to remember to switch battery. And a relay, presumably would only fail 
if it stuck open or something, which doesn't sound likely, but literature on
RV's suggested that an isolator was better than a relay. 

PLease shed a little light here, and thanks for your time.

Drive safely,
