   I'm an aircraft mechanic and inspector for a feeder airline.
I've often thought how great the bus and beetle would run if i put 8 hours
of preventive maintenace
per day into them!
Been driving the Westy everyday 50 miles round trip to work and love it.

P.s. Anyone know when the Vintage Volks show is in  Auburn Michigan?
Thanks.
