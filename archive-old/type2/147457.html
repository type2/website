Subject: Re: [T2] Autocad Drawings of Westy Panels

Scott,
I had promised the fellow measurements (the guy who wanted to do 
autocad) but I never actually delivered. . .  of westy panels but I 
started from a mixed set. . . front piece from a sunroof weekender and 
back piece from a westy.  the back piece was broken in 2 from removing 
it from the junkyard bus (so hard to get exact measurements) . . . but I 
did finally get the headliner in made of 3mm(??) baltic birch 
150mmx150mm sheets from custom hardwood supplier (Carolina Hardwood). 
end result looks really nice.  cherry stain is darker than stock.

we laid the old panels out for a pattern but ended up having to trim a 
little bit/some freehand work for a good tight fit.  not an exact 
science IMHO and probably difficult to put into CAD. maybe &quot;it was the 
carpenters&quot;, although I enlisted the help of someone with more 
woodworking experience. it was a challenge.  I bought and stained the 
wood almost a year before I got around to the project. . .

the important part is the bus roof is TAPERED from the middle to front 
and rear (i.e. not a rectangle).  the most complex curve is the front 
where it goes around the sunvisors. . . I can send you this piece for 
shipping costs (big and flat!). although it currently resides in another 
state.  I will most likely be driving through Dallas on the way to 
California in April (did somebody say Tahoe? ;) )

it's a tight fit. snap into place.  cut the wood with a jigsaw with a 
metal cutting blade (fine tooth) and you can tape the edge that you are 
cutting to reduce splintering.

good luck,
Will A.
