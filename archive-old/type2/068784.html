Hi all -
while over at Lewis' to shoot some bulls, his buddy Klein was working on a
customer's 73 westy... it squeaked. When the key was turned, the
motor/exhaust/back end let out one very pretty, highpitched &quot;chirp!&quot; This
would disappear at idle, but would return under load. After fooling with
belts, pulleys, exhaust headers, loose nuts, etc, we couldn't make it go
away. The engine had been rebuilt by owner recently; so we think maybe a
broken ring? Other possibilities are welcomed. BTW, Klein and Lewis are
hilarious to listen to when working... typical comments: &quot;we found your
problem... your engine's gotta squeak in it!    &quot;Yeah, VW installed factory
squakers in the engines so you would know it was on.&quot;... &quot;well, it's not
coming from the poptop, the dash, your seat, or your pager - I think we've
narrowed it down to the motor!&quot; &quot;you know, if we can just TUNE that squeak
to the right pitch, you could attract all kindsa birds with it...&quot;  (as
japanese car with wheel bearings gone WAAAAY south squeals by)&quot;THAT'S the
problem - yer squeaks not loud enough! I can only here your's for a block
or two.&quot; ad nauseum. I was funnier in person, I bet. I need ta get em a
radio show, they make Frick and Frack look like MacNeil/Lehrer.
(anyone know how to set up them internet radio thingys? They are actually
very good mechanics, and would be willing to take 2 hours a week to gab
about life if I could figure out how to do that.... might be a good Friday
Listie thing!)
