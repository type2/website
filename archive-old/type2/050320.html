Subject: [T2] Looking for a Westy

Hi,
My wife Amy and I have been searching for a Westy for awhile. We really
want something rust free.
Our luck really hasn't been good finding one so far. We are located in
Mystic, CT. If anyone has any leads
or a pop top for sale please please please let us know.

Regards,
Bill &amp; Amy
