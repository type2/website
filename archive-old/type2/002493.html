Well I finally got a gas heater for my bus, Now I'm trying to ID the thing.
I know its not an eberspaker..
It has two fans and a coil to kinda a spark plug...the lettering is missing
all it has is an &quot;N&quot; for the first letter and the rest is scratched except
the last four &quot;ATER&quot;  I'm going out on a limb here, this means heater   so
what I got is N      HEATER,  sorry this is vague but that's all I got to
work with....I got it to fire and heat, so it works.  But would like more
info on this...I hope the list can help
TIA
