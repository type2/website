I guess the earlier buses must be different, but as far as my 79 goes, its
quite easy to get the tank out. You dont need to lower the rear of the
engine and theres no screws underneath  the  tank cover. I can get the tank
cover off in 20 minutes then the most difficult bit is getting at the 2 nuts
which hold the tank straps down. I used a  long nose socket, and also had to
take off the left hand heater riser ( mine rusted off anyway). Then with all
the gubbins out from up above it'll slide out.

Again beware of the integrity of the outlet pipe on the tank. I had to
solder another bit in. Naked flames and gasoline fumes are not a good mix in
the workshop. I ran my air hose through the tank a good while first.
