Subject: GL5-MT1 (was) where to find GL4 80W90 gear oil

&gt; &lt;sigh&gt;  Archives is a *great* idea, but I'll cut to the chase.  GL-5 
&gt; spec gear oil contains extreme pressure additives that can be quite 
&gt; unkind to the brass synchros in your VW gearbox.  It won't make it blow 
&gt; up today or tomorrow, but it will shorten its life.

I hate to wake the sleeping giants but what the heck.
I did read the archives and came the conclusion that the GL5-MT1 has been 
reformulated and is acceptable for manual VW gearbox.
I got the impression that the GL5 warnings were now unfounded.

Am I killing my trans or not?
Fat dumb and happy (or 2 out of three) running GL5-MT1 for 80+ Mi. on rebuilt 
transmission.
Please slap some sense into me if I need it.
