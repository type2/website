&gt; I'm sure someone has.  But, unless you retrofit some form of power

yup did it on my first bus  (1960 deluxe)  David's right, it lasted about
a week, dang near pulled my arm outta my shoulder first time I tried to
parallel park.  leave the big wheel on and don't waste your money.


&gt; &gt; Better to drive?
&gt; No.;)  Probably much much harder, and more dangerous.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Any hints for reversing a Kombi, only driven once and finally got my 
&gt; &gt; own bus. I have been told reversing is hard at first
&gt; 

well I drove a bus for many years (not a VW, but Greyhound type) and I
disagree with the prochedures below (but YMMV) 

first thing we were taught is to not turn around, learn to trust your
mirrors.  

grab the bottom of your steering wheel (not the top) look forward and
drive back using just your outside rearview mirrors, (make sure they are
adjusted properly, you should just be able to see your rear bumper in the
bottom corner.)  A blind spot mirror on the near side (passenger side)
mirror is an huge help.

remember you are driving from what would normally be the front bumper of a
sedan or type 3

&gt; Well, reverse is hard in anything if you've not dont it much.
&gt; A:  find a big empty parking lot to practice in first. and soon.
&gt;    Pratice backing in and out of parking spaces.

good idea
&gt; 
&gt; B:  since bus's are notorious about lack of rear visbility, learn to use
&gt; what mirrors you have.  Add to that the usual of looking out the rear
&gt; window..   Also, learn to open the door and hang out while backing up (at
&gt; your own risk!:) to see behind you better.  BUT dont forget about what

DON'T hang out the door, what happens if you fall out (don't forget your
seatbelt) your nice new van drives away without you.

also turning around and looking out the rear window is a waste of time and
confuses your spatial orientation from looking in the mirrors.  you can
get away with it in a sedan but not a bus.  

in a bus the interior rearview mirror is for keeping an eye on the kids in
the back, not looking out of the bus. and the rear window is for the light
to keep the back of the bus from being too dark to read in the rear seat.

the outside mirrors are your friends, learn to use em to the fullest

&gt; Find something about 3 feet tall, and back up towards it.  when it
&gt; disappears, stop, and go see how much further you have before you hit it.
&gt; Pratice getting close to it without hitting it.  there is a real art to
&gt; this....

practicing is always usefull.

&gt; .....david (i parallel park my buses backwards.  that is, front first.
&gt; But then, i'm wierd.)

this I gotta see.  

Bob
I live intown in a major metro area and have to parallel park everywhere
except my garage, usually a dozen times a day.
