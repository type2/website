Subject: Re: [T2] Winter Storage

&lt;&lt;Agreed, I'll not easily get out of the predicament now, though.&gt;&gt;

Your right one this one--you done did it--:)

 
&lt;&lt;The paint with reducer and hardener is going to cost more than $300.00 
I was quoted PPG Omni, its a bit cheaper.&gt;&gt;

And let me say this about that.
It's the low end PPG paint, and you most certainly won't appreciate any
longevity outa it.

I've used it--wasn't really happy with it chaulking out in 8 months.

It's on the same page as Dupont's Dulux.

Bottom of the list of refinishing material's.


&lt;&lt;What's wrong with inside storage? 
The $80/month - that's whats wrong with it. &gt;&gt;

Back to the Rust Shield or the Blue tarp.
