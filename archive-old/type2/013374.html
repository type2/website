Brian:

If you happen to live in the Silicon Valley area, I  know of at least 2 FLAPS that sell Redline Tranny fluid.  I just bought 4 quarts of the GL-4 rated Redline at a place called Winchester Auto Parts.  If you want their phone number, I can get it for you.  They may be able to ship to you if you live elsewhere.
