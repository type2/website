Pry between the plastic horn button and the metal ring!  A knife makes

&gt; 	How did you get the steering wheel off? I've tried &quot;pry the

&gt; the botton and the plastic steering wheel, and it makes pieces of
&gt; the wheel crumble and come off. CLEARLY I'm doing this wrong, but
&gt; I haven't had the gumption to build something that would rest on
&gt; the wheel and allow me to pry at the horn button.
