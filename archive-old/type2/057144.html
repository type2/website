Bob, our new prize...finally, a real camper!...runs the same instrument rig,
and normally runs about 180 degrees here in the mountains. Feel of the
dipstick says that's about right. It did come with an obscenely large
external oil cooler. On this rig, the instrument set up appears to work. If
yours is showing 130, you can probably sell that engine for the big bucks :)
Marv Krupp, whose 74 cheapie now has tread-laying boosted brakes (thanks
