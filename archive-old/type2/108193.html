Subject: Quixotic Quest:  Heater/Vent knobs for 68-72 dash

While we're on the subject of parts we've been looking for for years, anyone
have a lead on the heater/vent knobs for the levers on a 68-72 vintage dash?
I've been looking for these for at least 10 years, off and on. I've got
levers with the knobs broken off -- I also have a couple of rubber-like
square knobs found in the the glovebox, most likely left from a PO.

I've come across a part number: 211 259 367  Heater / Fresh Air Lever with
Knob, Bus 1968 to 1973

The vent moves easily, and I don't have much use for the heater, so it's
been a low-priority task.

Thanks.....
