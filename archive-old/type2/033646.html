More power to you! A man must have his wine.

In an emergency almost any oil will work, including Vegitable oil.  It had
better be a real emergency though as it will probably destroy your
transaxle.  I'm talking about manual tranny, mind you...I dont think that
Wesson Oil will give good shifting properties in an automatic.

In other words, if your life is on the line, anything is better than
nothing.
