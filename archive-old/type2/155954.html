Subject: Re: [T2] Gold leafing a bus.

&gt; Does anyone have any
&gt; experience doing this?  I am wondering if the gold leafing kits you
&gt; can get at your local craft stores would stand up to the weather in
&gt; Seattle.

Back when I used to make custom computer cases, I did one with craft
store gold leaf per the customer's request.

It scratches VERY easily. I ended up having the case gold chromed
instead. Expensive, but my customer was happy after I showed pics of
how delicate that stuff really is for something that's used and not a
decoration.
