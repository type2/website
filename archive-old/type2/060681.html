Hi Chris and/or Holly.

I would use talc.  I was just trying to bait a discussion on the topic;
graphite - talc - or  - 'vegetable oil  / baby oil'

I jacked up my bus untill I got a level reading on a cheap carptenders
level.   I found my bus was over 2.25 inches down at the rear window.  Down
from level. This made a BIG difference on the rear view.  I computed this to
be just ONE DEGREE difference!! Approx., of course.   (32&quot; (rear wheel center
to rear window) + 95&quot; (wheel base) = 120&quot; approx.    The tangent of 120 and
2.25 is about 1 degree??)  [[I DID say approx, didn't I!!!)

Later,  I took both rear wheels off, and cleaned up the four (x 2 wheels)
bolts around  the spring plate/ rear wheel bearing housing /'X' bar.   After
looking at the situation, I think I discovered this is more than I want to
try.

The 4x2 big bolts could use an impact hammer, or some heave leverage bar to
break them loose.  I don;t have leverage room.

After they are loose, I would have to hang the rear wheel bearing housing and
'X' bar from the body so as not to tear up my brake lines. (or take everything
off!!)  'Perhaps' my shocks could support everything??

Also, I think I would like/need an instrument to read the angle on the spring
plate.  ONE degree is significant, and carpenters level and a school
protractor may not handle it.

I am not afraid of the 'spring' in the spring plate, just the three points
mentioned 1 4x2 bad bolts needing impact hammer, 2 suspension of rear stuff
after I remove spring plates, and 3 accurate measurement of angle (I can get
the bus 'level' by measuring distances from the rain gutter to the floor -
front and rear; along the side-, and I can 'mark' the angle of the spring
plate from the 'level' horizontal with a carpenters level taped on to some
white board, and making a mark along the spring plate.  It's just that the
measure of this angle is too critical )

I am off to K &amp; K Auto in Fredericksburg VA to check out Mr. John Kelly.  I
got a respectable referal to him from 'big' Pete at Trak Auto, Woodbridge VA.

&gt; Please tell me what you find out. I'm going to have to do this soon. I
&gt; don't have a local dealer.
