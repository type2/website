Subject: FW: [VB] Pics of my new dyno

A dyno is used to tell the HP and torque of an engine, also used to help set
the air/fuel mixtures under loads. I will be able to break in new engines
and dial them in before putting in a bus'

original message to the other list


   Here are some pics of my new dyno, Any vintage information would be
appreciated.I have sent an email to Stuska to see what they can tell me and
have heard from an EMPI geru that it was an item available through EMPI in
the old school days.
   Note the split case trans, EMPI amp gauge and the Speedwell oil pressure
gauge. This came out of an old dealers personal stash and doesn't appear to
have been used very much. It also has a water tank and a fuel can that came
with it.
   I am going back to the stash on Friday to see what else I can get/find.
