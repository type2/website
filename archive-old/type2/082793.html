Subject: North American source for Propex 1600?

I am reading with glee the product specs on the Propex 1600 
HeatSource at:

http://www.bluebird-type2.co_dot_uk/prod4.html

Only problem is it is 4oo Pounds Sterling or around $900 
Canadian / $550 US. Are there any North American distributors?
Does anyone know who makes these?

Thanks,
Chris
