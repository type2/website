I guess that I'll bend to the &quot;conventional wisdom&quot; though the actual &quot;proof&quot;
would be a walk through the type 2 microfiche.  If VW supplied them, then I'd
go for it, if not, I'd reset the torsion bars.  While there are many positive
experience replies, my experience has not been so good.  First, there is the
problem of the mount failing.  In my experience, ('62 type 21 double cargo
door) the failure came about 80 miles from the nearest paved road and about
twice that distance from the nearest parts house/welding facilities (north rim
Grand Canyon). It was a LONG, scary drive at 15 mph. Secondly, I have observed
that coil over shocks never seem to last more than a couple years.  I have gas
shocks on both my '77 Riviera (NAPA) and on my '84 Vanagon (Bilsteins).  Both
have nearly 60k miles without any sign of failure.  The coil overs that I have
used rarely go 20k before all the damping goes away.  Pricing of coil overs vs
conventional shocks is such that one can get a GOOD shock for the same
money...  

I guess that YOU pays yer money and takes yer choice.
