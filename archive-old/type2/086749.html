Subject: Re: [T2] pulling gastank on 79 bus

 
--Consensus is yes, but that it is a hell of a lot easier with the motor out/lowered somewhat.

I did it on my '79 recently with the motor out, sat in the engine area and had an easier time of it. Don't forget the hidden two screw on the bottom of the bulkhead panel.
