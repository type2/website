Subject: Re: [T2] Lapping cylinders to heads?

&gt; Hi all:
&gt; 
&gt; I know I've heard mention of lapping the cylinders into the heads they're
&gt; going to &quot;live&quot; in as part of the engine rebuilding/assembly process.  I
&gt; even thought I remember Bob Hoover mentioning it in his Sermons, though I
&gt; can't seem to find any reference to that process there.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, does anybody have any strong opinions pro or con about this process?
&gt; I take it it's simply a matter of putting a small amount of valve lapping
&gt; compound on the top of the cylinder and then gently rotating the cylinder
&gt; back and forth in its head?
&gt; 
&gt; TIA.

Tom,

There are no cons to doing this, only pros. Head leaks on type iv motors are
very common because of the large bore sizes, and the fact that the head
studs are not perfectly centered on the cylinder bore. Anything you can do
to improve the seal is a good thing, and lapping the cylinders in the heads
definitely helps.

You must first lap the cylinder tops themselves on a perfectly flat surface,
a thick piece of glass will work well. Once this is done, then lap each
cylinder into its respective head spigot. Then apply some machinists dye to
the heads (after cleaning the head) and re-do the process. The dye will show
when/if the surface of the head is true.
