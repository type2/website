Brian,

The first symptom you described is that of a worn throw-out bearing.

The second symptom may indicate a loose or mis-aligned transmission... or
several other things.  However, a loose or misaligned transmission would
cause your throw-out bearing to wear asymmetrically.  Taken together, there's
a good chance the tranny was installed properly, or the engine is not
properly installed to the tranny, or both.

While it would seem almost impossible to get the engine in wrong, it turns
out to be a very common problem.  The mating surfaces are relatively small
and easily dinged, plus the rear tranny mounts (on early buses, at least)
often bulge enough to interfer with the engine (ie, to touch it during
bolt-up), preventing it from being bolted flush to the tranny.  This leaves
the tranny and engine at a slight angle, with the flywheel/clutch rotating in
a plane not perfeclty perpendicular to the mainshaft.  Although the throw-out
bearing pivots in the throw-out bearing carrier, it only does so in the
vertical plane.  Any misalignment in the horizontal plane will wipe our the
throw-out bearing very quickly.  (Since the throw-out bearing pivots are
square to the mainshaft, any misalignment between engine and tranny sees all
of the clutch-load being taken on only one segment of the throw-out bearing,
resulting in greatly accelerated wear.)

Take the vehicle back to the fellow who did the work and ask him to check it
out.  If he's a competent mechanic he'll do the right thing. 

At the very least you're going to need a new throw-out bearing, which means
dropping the engine.  With the engine out, check the condition of your tranny
mounts both front and rear.  If they are the least bit spongy, replace them
- -- they are critical to the tranny's alignment and smooth shifting.  Prior to
mating the tranny and engine give the mating surface a careful inspection,
dressing the surfaces smooth with files if necessary.

It is standard practice to replace the tranny mounts and throw-out bearing
when replacing the tranny.  If this was not done you are dealing with the
wrong kind of people.

- -Bob
