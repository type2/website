Man oh man you don't want to accidentally ground out
any power wires connected to that circuit.  I had a 92
Jetta with the same feature.  Loved it.  Had the key
in working on my radio and grounded the red wire
(switched 12V).  Zot!  No more radio switch.  I
learned this lesson so well I repeated it with my 94
Jetta GLX.  Doh!  Luckily it was under a 12 month
warranty so I brought it back to the dealer claiming
my radio no longer worked.  They had to put in a new
ignition switch which isn't cheap if I recall.

It bites having to remember to turn off your radio
after you shut it off.  I always meant to put in a
toggle switch so I could use the key switch or disable
it.  I wonder if my 77 Westy does this?  Probably
never, definitely not now.

I knew there was a reason you were supposed to
disconnect the battery...
