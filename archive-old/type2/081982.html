Mark,

Since you don't have 'excess' crankcase pressure you probably don't have a
hole in you piston. With a compression reading of ZERO you probably have a
really bad burned exhaust valve. It's not your intake valve - your engine
would have a hard time running with a lot of back-flow into your intake
manifold. And yes, you need to drop the engine.

Good luck!

&gt;#'s 2,3 and 4 have lots of black soot on the plugs (too rich)
&gt;No back-firing out the exhaust, even with some small leaks in the exhaust.
&gt;
&gt;My thoughts tend to lean towards a bad valve, but which one, intake or
&gt;exhaust?
&gt;
&gt;Also, for those with the experience, should one drop the engine to remove
&gt;the head or can I do it with the engine in place?
