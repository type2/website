Here's what I did. The BAS 911 style cooling shroud I used (Type IV 2.0 in 
a Beetle) has no provisions for a stock oil cooler in the stock location. 
The space is there but there is no ducted air for it.

I used an adaptor plate to replace the oil cooler on it is mount with a 
place to attach two oil lines. The lines run under the car - forward- to a 
CB performance thermostat and then on to a stock oil cooler laying 
horizontally - but pointed so the air flow blows through it. The thermostat 
in the engine block regulated flow to the relocated OEM cooler and the CB 
Performance thermostat regulated flow to the second oil cooler.

Now connected to the thermostat is a second oil cooler - a flat, square 
18&quot;x18&quot; cooler. It can be bought at Pep Boys.

It is located above the transaxle on the driver's side and lays almost flat 
- the curve of the package tray behind the rear seat forces a slight tilt - 
that's the curve where the flat bottomed package tray curves down and the 
floor goes under the back seat.

The space that the tilt and the curved floor creates above the oil cooler 
is used for an electric fan - can also bought from Pep Boys. I have the fan 
setup to suck air from the bottom of the oil cooler through the top. There 
is an electric fan thermostat that tells the fan when to run.

It's been several years since I drove the car - it was my project during my 
Navy years and since I've been out, I've been busy with getting married (4 
years ago) our first child, first house, etc - and an other wise very thin 
budget.

I can tell you this: I towed a Hyundai Excel from Norfolk to Chattanooga an 
never saw oil temps above about 220 (I think) with the VDO temp sender 
screwed into the round plate at the right rear of the engine bottom below 
the oil filler.

The car would run cool most of the time (180 - 190?) until I started up the 
mountain where my parents lived when it would climb and top out at 220 or 
so. It seemed that the OEM cooler in the wind under the car was plenty 
sufficient and the 18&quot; cooler definitely came into play on the mountain 
roads. The fan never came on until I stopped moving.

Oil pressure seemed to be about 30 psi when I was on the move and 8 or 10 
at full hot idle. Understand the engine was an engine I bought for $100 out 
of the junkyard in Italy when I lived there. It is a GE code engine with 
hydraulic lifters. I knew nothing about it's history or internal condition.

The 2.0 Type IV engine in bus configuration (lower compression ratio, tune) 
is the perfect engine for a Beetle. I was designing a car with grunt - if 
not top speed - to climb the local mountain roads and occasionally do some 
light towing. I wasn't building a car to do drag races or anything.

The engine ran/runs Dellorto 36mm DRLA carbs, BAS linkage and intake 
manifolds, BAS 911 cooling (modified my me to add thermostatic controlled 
warm up - flapper doors), dual quiet pack exhaust, and a 3.88 r/p gearbox. 
050 distributor and Bosch Blue Coil ignition.

I'm interested in a low psi turbo (9 psi or less), CIS injection possibly, 
definitely a 901 Porsche gearbox (Berg 5 would be great if I could afford 
one) , and electronic ignition - at least Vanagon/Rabbit style OEM design. 
I've got a better cam - just a #110 camshaft - mild b/c I like my hydraulic 
lifters.

If not a turbo, I would at least raise the compression about half a point 
or so.

Just remember that the more coolers and longer lines CAN (not WILL IMHO) 
lead to lower oil pressure. Of course overheating oil can lead to lower oil 
pressure too so you have to find the happy medium - cool the oil enough to 
recover any oil pressure lost to the extra lines and cooler.

Hope this helped.

&gt;Hi All,
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone know how much cooler the oil is or how
&gt;much higher the oil pressure is with the fan forced
&gt;oil cooler?  Is this oil cooler the same size as
&gt;stock?
