Warning...LARGE! (i scanned these a few years ago and have never done
anything with'm...)

These are from a mexican Combi dealer brochure from..oh..late eighties i
think?  Of course, they're in spanish. But they have pictures! :)


&gt; Too bad they're illegal to import or I'd have taken one home with me!  Oh
&gt; well, even if you can't own one, you can have a piece of one; many of the
&gt; genuine VW parts I import are actually made for those busses (but
&gt; interchange with our old German ones).

So...what about getting a nose, radiator, plumbing, transmision and
engine mount kit? ~grin~  Yeah, I know. waaaay to much work and waaaay to
much money.

My favorite part?? The access hatch to the fuel gauge sender. Why didnt
they think of that earlier!!!!
