Subject: re: 79 rebuild question

I just rebuilt a 79 from a long block up and had only done a 71 that I had
10 years ago. I found it to be similar. I was careful to label fuel
injection and wiring from the electronic control unit *very* well. I also
bought and read and re-read and then followed the Bentley manual.
