Subject: [Q] Engine Smoking

Greetings,

I have a '71 Camper with rebuilt engine.  The engine produces a good deal 
of smoke when coming down a hill (e.g. taking my foot off the gas, leaving 
it in gear, letting the wheels drive the engine).  Of course, if I take it 
out of gear, the engine isn't being driven and there is virtually no 
smoke.  Also, when the engine hasn't warmed up yet (coming down a hill 
within a few minutes of having been cranked) the engine doesn't smoke.  (I 
think this last point just shows that until there is sufficient heat 
available, the oil won't burn.)

I think that I'll have to rebuild the motor, replacing at a minimum the 
piston rings.  However, before I do this, is it possible that something 
else is going on?  Other than the smoke, the engine seems to run fine and 
compression/power feels good.  (No, I haven't run a compression check -- 
I'm just talking about how it behaves on the open road.)

I had someone suggest valvoline on my next oil change.  It's hard to 
believe that this will help.  What about valve adjustments?

Any other suggestions?

Regards,
David
