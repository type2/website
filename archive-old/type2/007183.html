joe - did you leave your dipstick out?  This sounds stupid, but I did it once
and had all of the same symptoms you describe.  I'm still trying to recover
from the smell in my heater boxes!  Also, I think the cracked oil filler tube
could really do this, especially up a hill or something with a little positive
pressure from the crankcase. . .
