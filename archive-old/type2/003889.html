Subject: Need part number for 050 rotor and cap
Date: Tue, 28 Nov 2000 17:34:29 -0500
Organization: Microsoft Corporation

Volks,
    Just installed my new(used) 050 mechanical advance dizzy, but did not
realize that the rotor and probably cap are of a different size than those
that fit the 009.

Can anyone point me in the right direction here?

TIA
