Tom, and all,

If he has immediate fuel pressure drop, and gas in his oil, why would we not look at them together?

Couldn't a leaking injector coupled with some bad rings allow this to happen?

That's not causing your problem.  Pressure should remain fairly high for 10-15 minutes.

I am still having the gas in oil problem.How long should the fuel pressure be high after the key is turned off? My pressure drops to 0 in 3 to 5 seconds after I turn the switch off. Is this normal
