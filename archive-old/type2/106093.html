Subject: cleaning engine

Is there an easy way of cleaning my engine compartment??  What I am worried 
about is all those fine little wires popping off of whatever they hook up to. 
 Or using some chemical that eats the grease spots, as well as my fuel lines. 
 Call me paranoid but I want to avoid a disaster, this is my everyday ride to 
work.  One other thing is when my bus heats up at a good running temp. It 
doesn't want to idle anymore?? I need to do the ol' doulble pedal brake 
routine ie: one foot on brake and one on gas...  other than that, runn'n 
sweet.   Thnks DOC!!!!!!!
