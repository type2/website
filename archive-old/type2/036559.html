&gt; 1.  Is the alleged #3 timing ritard in 009 distributors a function of the cap
&gt; &amp; rotor or is it the way the lobes on the shaft are cut? How do they do that?

It's the lobes.  Omne lobe is machined a bit more counterclockwise than it
would normally be.  this is the reason for the offset slot on the
distributor drive, so that the distributor will only fit one way.
