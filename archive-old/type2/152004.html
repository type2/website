&gt; Hey GUYS GALS
&gt; I am at witts end. The lady just called back about 10
&gt; min after my post last night she was moving her bus
&gt; acrost the parking lot and it started on fire.  I am

did she get it out right away??

what caught fire.  might be an easy fix

&gt; not shure but I am begining to think that the bus or
&gt; someone does not want to leave.  I am going to inform
&gt; her that her best bet is to call mom and get a way
&gt; home, leave the bus there is no way we can fund a
&gt; complete overhaul.

can't exactly leave it in the parking lot...maybe just get a tow home,
rent a U-haul and trailer....?!?!
