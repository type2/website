&gt; What I would take issue with, however, is whether under full load, the
&gt; vacuum advance is even functional because under full load the throttle
&gt; butterfly is fully open and the vacuum in the whole intake tract is
&gt; pretty low. I don't know how low, but I'd bet it's less that 8 inches.
&gt; Anyone with a functional vacuum guage care to enlighten me?
&gt; This would indicate that a stock engine under full load has  more like
&gt; 32 degrees lead, not 44.

        Possibly. But nobody sets their timing while they're running under
full-load, do they? So you set it at full throttle, no-load, and maybe, if
your corrent (and it sounds logical), the engine retards that a bit more
under load. All the more reason to make sure that it's set far enough
advanced under no load, or you'll really be losing power just when you need
it, under load.
       When I was running upright engines years ago, I never had a timing
light (acutally I had one but it was so anemic it had to be dark out to see
it flash so I never used it) and I just set them statically at 10BTDC at
first, then experimented by upping that until it pinged, then brought it
back a tad, went out and ran up a steep hill and listened to hear if it
pinged under load, and finally settled on 12BTDC with my bus engine --a
1800 T1 w/ cam, roller crank, extractor, 050 dizzy, and highpressure oil
pump and external cooler. 12BTDC was good for that engine. I also used 12
for various other bug engines with 009 dizzys and extractors.
       Anyway, as you said, the ping point is what you want to avoid, but
44-45 max, no-load should cause no ping in a stock T4.
