Subject: RE: [T2] Rubber

&gt;  When I serviced video games we had some silicone stuff that we treated the
&gt; rubber bumpers on pinball machines with...it worked nicely. I had also used
&gt; it on the rubber seals of my Ford Maverick. It is a silicone gel lubricant.

That may be fine for that application but silicone is deadly on rubber exposed to the
sun. It will look good for awhile but then it will suck the life out of it. The VW
owner's manuals suggest talcum (baby) powder.
