Subject: Re: [T2] Wheel adapters - '70's bolt pattern onto a '74 westy

&gt; I recently purchased some wheels without thinking about one thing, the bolt

&gt; was a change to a more narrow pattern.  Is there an adapter to allow me to go
&gt; to the larger pattern??  I believe I'm going from a 114.3mm pattern to a
&gt; 203.2mm pattern..
&gt;
&gt; any help will be greatly appreciated,.

You can adapt anything to anything, but it would be smarter to get a set
of proper wheels.  The overall cost would probably be about the same as
the adapters and the result much more workmanlike.
