When it stalls check to see if the coil is getting juice from the key. I 
would also check to see if the grounded side of the coil is getting a good 
ground when the motor is rolled over with the key - a test light or meter 
will show 12V-0V-12V etc while the engine is being turned - by hand (pull 
that coil cable to dist. first) or by the starter.

Could be a few possibilities - I would be absolutely sure that this is an 
ignition problem and not a failing fuel pump. Also are the connections on 
the coil or in the dist. (points) still tight if you try to pull them off? 
Is the double relay for the fuel pump working correctly?

Might rig up a test light and pressure gauge for the fuel ring (test nipple 
is on the fuel line on the driver's side of the engine) and have somebody 
ride in the back seat with the engine cover off. Either the ignition system 
will cause the test light or timing light or dwell meter or plain test 
meter (whatever you use) to quit or the fuel pressure gauge will go to 
zero. If the computer is having problems then it could quit firing the fuel 
injectors with the same results you described.

Hang in there - these engines and their injection aren't that complicated.

Also plan on replacing the fuel injector seals - mine were baked and 
causing big vacuum leaks (idle problems, low power).

&gt;First post, so, sorry for the length.
&gt;
&gt;I recently purchased a stock 78 bus. 2.0L Fuel injected.
&gt;Compression tested well, ran OK, clearly a project, but the body and 
&gt;interior was in Fair+ shape.
&gt;Tuned it up last week - new plugs, points, rotor, cap, condenser, wires, 
&gt;(did not replace the coil) - set idle, dwell and timing to spec's,  - 
&gt;needs a muffler, but runs well.
&gt;Changed oil, installed correct new oil filter, air filter.
&gt;Found the engine has no seal in the compartment, and the fan that blows 
&gt;down into the (heat exchangers) - I think, it's been 15 years since my 
&gt;last bus), missing the in-line fuse.  Installed fuse, and it works.
&gt;
&gt;Two miles into it's test drive, it quits.  Going thirty-five, motor just 
&gt;cuts out - no flickering lights, nothing.
&gt;Try to restart it and no luck; plenty of battery, spins like a top.  Spend 
&gt;about fifteen minutes of pulling wires, etc.  Was not getting spark from 
&gt;the main coil lead.  Try everything I know two miles from home with no 
&gt;tools, (all right, more like ten minutes), prepare to walk home and decide 
&gt;to try one more time, and Bang, fires right up.  Continue about three more 
&gt;miles and she quits again.  This time, without touching anything, she 
&gt;fires back up after waiting about half an hour.  Get almost home and she 
&gt;quits again.  Walk home get a ride back to the Bus, ( 30 minutes or so 
&gt;pass) and she fires right up.  Happened again today the same way.
&gt;
&gt;When I drove the bus home the day I bought it, and it ran OK, the main 
&gt;Vacuum advance hose was not connected - it is now, and timed accordingly 
&gt;and runs great at 7.5 btd - when it runs!
&gt;
&gt;I'm looking for ideas on where to start. Could this be caused by a bad new 
&gt;condenser, or, could the coil be in the process of failing?  Could it be a 
&gt;bad vacuum advance/distributor?  I removed the distributor when I replaced 
&gt;and set the points, and the advance seemed sticky - hard to move, hard to 
&gt;return, BUT, the timing mark moved perfectly under the timing light.
&gt;
&gt;Last problem - and responses to this will determine how much time and 
&gt;money to dedicate to the balance of this project.
&gt;While inspecting the vehicle in my driveway in the full light of day, I 
&gt;find that the two large brackets that hold the lower front axle beam to 
&gt;the frame, are almost completely rusted away. (Axle beam look ok) It 
&gt;appears that the driver side is rusted all the way through, and the 
&gt;passenger side is starting.  Will/Can this (need to) be replaced?  It 
&gt;seems to be a big project, but the rest of the bus is in decent 
&gt;shape.  Could I have someone weld some bracketing for the beam to the 
&gt;inside of the existing brackets?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for any help!
