Subject: 1977 T2 engine longevity 

In 1977 I rented a VW bus to tour Germany  with my wife and two of our sons. 
  It was a great vehicle except that it was equipped with a rev limiter.  
Getting on an autobahn got pretty exciting as the limiter kicked in when I 
needed revs the most.  Also, down shifting on hills took some getting used 
too.  Part of the problem is that the limiting action was rather abrupt and 
seemed to have some threshold hysteresis.

When I complained to the rental agent he said he understood but the motors 
dont last six months without the limiter. Germans love to rev and go fast.

Many years latter I passed on a 1977 bus to my youngest son . Six months 
later He brought it home with a blown piston.  Sons like to rev and go fast.

Efficient catalytic converter operation requires a low ( &gt; 1%) input CO  
(carbon monoxide) exhaust content but low CO content increases the risk of  
engine failure unless lambda, antiknock and EGR  subsystems are provided.
The 1977 (Cal version) bus comes from the factory with a catalytic converter 
  and is set to run at 1% CO exhaust content. It comes without lambda 
control of CO or anti-knock control and with an EGR system prone to leak air 
or clog. While EGR clogging is better than leaking both can reduce engine 
life.

The EGR function lowers NOx (oxides of nitrogen) emissions by injecting  
around 10%  of the exhaust gases into the input manifold. The object is to 
cool the combustion chamber by lowering the effective air/fuel ratio.

As a desired side effect EGR reduces detonation occurrence.

As a undesired  side effect exhaust gases clogs up the intake air 
distributor and EGR valve both which must be pulled and cleaned  roughly 
every two years.  The EGR filter rusts out and leaks air. The EGR valve 
clogs and has leaky seal problems. Leaked air can increases detonation 
occurrence.

While EGR components may be NLA in the future, replacement EGR filters seem 
to be  available now for around $140.  The EGR valve is harder to find. 
Rebuilt EGR valves were  available (in 2002) at $200 ea. (Company name: SMOG 
HELP 1-800-544-4357).  I bought one and  replaced a defective lever arm to 
avoid  return hassles.

By design the 1977 bus EGR feedback is blocked at high throttle loosing the  
cooling effect when it is needed most.  EGR feedback is also blocked at 
idle, to prevent rough running .

Not equipped with lambda or anti knock controls and with  a blocked or leaky 
ERG system the 1977 bus is a detonation waiting to happen.

After passing SMOG last February  the following steps  to improve  engine 
longevity occurred to me.

1. Lose the EGR system. Block both the exhaust and the air manifold ends.
Preserves the high cost EGR filter and EGR valve.
Prevents a leaking filter or valve from introducing unmetered air.
Increases  intake air distributor  cleaning interval.
Raises miles per gallon.
Engine is more prone to detonation.
Should only be done when implementing step 2.

2. Run at 4% CO at 900 RPM.
Reduces NOx emissions below the level obtained with EGR system working with 
1% CO.
Cooler combustion chamber that is less prone to detonation.
Smooth idle.
Exceeds maximum California SMOG  CO level of  2.5% at idle.
Exceeds VWs recommendation of 1%.
Lower miles per gallon.

3. Lose the cat converter, muffler, tail pipe, transverse pipe and Y pipe.
Install a $95  Pacesetter muffler.  89MJ6171X from JCW is an example.
Keeps the cat converter from being poisoned by the richer air/fuel ratio 
(step 2).
Preserves the high cost cat converter muffler , tail pipe, transverse pipe 
and Y pipe.
The Pacesetter  does provide an EGR port if you desire to retain that 
function.

4. Set dwell at 38 degrees.
No effect at lower RPM except less dissipation stress on coil.
Points might last longer (lower high RPM stress).
Violates VW recommendation 42 to 58 degrees.
Graceful rev limiting above 4000 RPM ( 1st 15 mph, 2ed 27 mph, 3ed 45 mph, 
4th 68 mph)

5. Use the highest octane gas available at the pump station.
May reduce detonation probability.

It turns out that steps 1 through 3 violate the US Federal Clean Air Act  
($2,500 each violation for modifying a SMOG system) and California SMOG 
regulations.  Step 4 violates Dolans First Law. Of course when I became 
aware of these violations I promptly returned my bus to the stock 
configuration.
