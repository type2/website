Subject: Ready to test-run my first rebuilt engine
Message-ID: &lt;36FA54D1.5C28705D_at_supernet_dot_net&gt;

Got the engine completely assembled.

I'm slightly worried that I didn't get the dizzy drive shaft exactly
aligned right, but it seems to static time OK.  The engine rebuilding
video I used showed a way to install the shaft before putting the case
back together, which I followed (everything else has it take place after
the case is together).  I guess I may end up having to lift the shaft
and turn it a tooth or two.

Bought a battery and wired the coil, oil pressure lite, and starter. 
I've cranked it over with the starter a few dozen times the past couple
of nights, looking &amp; listening.  Puppy has compression, that's for sure.

The bus this engine goes in is 50 miles from my house, so my test stand
is my disassembled '65 beetle convertible (body, pan, &amp; rear end are in
place, rear apron is off, it's on wheels - handy, but bigger than the
test stands my FLAPS carries :-).

I'm not sure how to supply it with fuel while test running it.  Will the
fuel pump suck gas from a gas can sitting on the floor nearby, or must
the supply be higher than the engine and/or must I start a siphon flow?

The shop doors will be wide open and exhaust fans on when I test run it,
with an assistant to shut off the fans in case of fire.  Fire
extinguishers and garden hoses will be charged and ready.

Advice I've heard is to start it, go straight to 2000 RPM, and run it
around that speed for 20 minutes, listening and looking closely the
whole time.  I'll probably go ahead and change the oil at that point,
then again after a couple hundred miles.

Any contrary ideas, supplementary advice, strident condescending
warnings, or words of encouragement greatly appreciated.  Wish me luck.
