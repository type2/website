IF you find a source for new ones let me know, I have been looking for
years, my fuel pump is held on with hose clamps but I have scarfed those
bushings whenever I could find em, but 20+ year old ones don't like being
yanked off in junque yards, and rarely survive the removal installation
process for very long
