&gt; I have two questions about heat. First, where can you get a B1C and how much
&gt; do they cost? Second, Would my 74 bus have the control switch for the heat
&gt; vent in the middle of the floor? It has always been on and I hven't seen a
&gt; switch under my seat that would control it, it would be nice to end that
&gt; extra heat up front.

Since modelyear 1973 or 1974 the heater outlet is controlled by a lever
on the dash. The one that has &quot;DEF.&quot; beside it. If it is in the lowest
position all the heat goes to the windshield. In the middle the heat
goes the your feet in the cabin. Turn it to the top and you'll have heat
in the back as well. Often this system doesn't work anymore like it was
new. Perhaps one cable is broken or not connected to the lever anymore.
