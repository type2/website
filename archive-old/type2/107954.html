Subject: Re: [T2] Windshield washer

From: &quot;Zach Freshman&quot; &lt;zachary_at_freshmans_dot_com&gt;
&gt; I haven't had washers for the 8 years I've had my bus, but now I can't
stop thinking it would be sort of nice.

Not having them has been driving me nuts!  Lots of road grime down here in
these parts.
