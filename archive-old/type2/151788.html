Subject: Re: [T2] on the road

Timothy,

Stop at a Radio Shack and buy yourself a digital infrared 
thermometer.  Next time your oil or heads get that hot, stop on the side 
of the road, get out, crawl under the bus and measure the temperature
of the oil filter while still running.  Is it really 280 degrees?

The hotest that my 78 has gotten has been about 215 at the oil filter...on 
a 4 hour  75+mph run in 85 degree weather on the interstate in Oklahoma.


Don't measure heads at the exhaust ports, but maybe pull one of the 
spark plugs and aim down thru the spark plug hole for your highest 
reading.  Check the top of the case and see what it is.

The best thng that all of you folks with VDO gauges could do is to 
calibrate them before you ever put them in your bus.

We **know** they lie...just by how much is a funtion of the outside temps, 
whether the gauges are mounted perfectly vertical and a host of other 
things.  See my write up on the CHT gauge on Richard's site....error is 
*not* linear.

Timothy, consider this....if you didn't have the gauges, would you believe 
your bus was running well?

Cheers, dave

&gt; Well, friends, here I am, sitting in a KOA in Holbrook, AZ, after two 
days and 1000 miles on my '74 bus. I have full instrumentation, 
and I'm slightly concerned about CHT readings. 

Iknow, everyone who knows says you shouldn't trust 'em, and perhaps 

I'm being a bit anal, but at certain points (climbing tough grades, terrible headwind, etc.), 
my CHT would rise to almost 500! 
Now, if I let up and slow down, sure, it will go down. 
But I've got to believe there is nothing inherently 
wrong with driving at least 60mph. Mostly, the gauge would read about 425. Am I destroying things?
&gt;  
&gt; Also, my oil temp got up to nearly 280 degrees for a short bit. Is this killing things, too?
