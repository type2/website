Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Help - shipping a bus from the US to Europe

&lt;Baltimore to Bremerhaven earlier this year for the
50th birthday of the Karmann Ghia and it cost around $1000 by the time I
paid all the fees at both ends. The paperwork is a pain but these guys
ship cars and household goods for the armed services all the time&gt;

Man, bet building the crate was a pain!!! &lt;grin! just kidding&gt;

I SERIOUSLY considered sending a Fiat 500 back from Italy with my household goods - disassembled of course for parts... 

Been kicking myself ever since...
