I see that Wheelskins ( http://www.wheelskins_dot_com ) is now making the
perforated style of steering wheel covers. Their standard size wheel covers
run $30 to $50 on the web but the VW bus requires a special order size. (At
least my '71 which has a 17 3/4 diameter wheel). Don't know how much special
ordering costs but I will inquire.
Does anybody know of any specific brands of steering wheel covers which come
in a standard size to fit a bus?

Thanks,
Bill Moon

| Much cheaper, medium cool looking...and replaceable when it goes.
|
| Just a thought...
