Subject: Removing spark plugs
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.SOL.3.96.990427105457.19438A-100000_at_techsrv1.tech.mtu_dot_edu&gt;

I've seen several posts on how to avoid dropping spark plugs into the tin,
but I haven't seen anyone mention the method I've had good results with. I
think I originally got the idea from someone on the list.  My socket's
rubber insert doesn't hold nearly well enough for my taste, so I tear off
a narrow strip of duct tape and stick it to one of the inner faces of the
socket, wrapping around to the outside.  The single thickness of tape
narrows the clearance just enough to make the plug a snug fit in the
socket.  I had a few 'close calls' before I started trying this, and
haven't had one since.
