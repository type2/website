Sometimes when your filter or strainer is partially clogged it will cause
it to whine.
Drop the pan and clean the filter.

&gt; I have a 79 Westy with the auto tranny and I'm sitting here pondering 
&gt; how
&gt; the physics of the torque converter assembly meshes with the 
&gt; differential,
&gt; as they are seperate units. Where are the 1-2-3 gears, in the torque
&gt; converter assembly, or inside the differential assembly? How do the 
&gt; two work
&gt; with each other? I've been chatting with some list members about my 
&gt; buzzing
&gt; vibration/whining noise that occurs in 2nd at 35mph and then in 3rd 
&gt; at
&gt; 55mph, and I'm trying to see how this could occur. If you put it in 
&gt; neutral
&gt; at speed, the noise stops. My Hayes manual is at the office of 
&gt; course. :-(
&gt; Thanks,
