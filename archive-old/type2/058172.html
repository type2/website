hi George
my reference books give a GA prefix for a 73-74 2L 914 motor give s a comp
ratio of 7.6:1 w/D-jetronic fuel injection
if you shave the heads you will raise comp., you need to cc and fly cut the
heads to lower the comp, but if they cc stock you shouldn't need to do
anything to the heads.
2300 seems a bit steep with left coast 914s  going 3-4000 for complete car. As
the engine is almost identical to yours I'd say use the money to make yours a
go'faster
my .02
