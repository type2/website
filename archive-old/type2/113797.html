Subject: Re: [T2] Where does the 3rd tube from the fuel pump (mech) go?
  '72 Bus with dual Webers.

&gt;This hose is a vent for the fuel pump in case the pump goes bad.  The end 
&gt;of it tucks into a hole in your lower flat piece of cooling tin under #'s 
&gt;1 and 2 cylinder.  I expect you need a new pump or at least to rebuild 
&gt;your old one. greg




&gt;  I don't understand what
&gt;this spout is for.
