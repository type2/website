Subject: Re: resucitating a clutch plate
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

How did China Cat's clutch plate end up glazed (apparently oily in there too) 
when there is no oil on the flywheel or the pressure plate?

The dopey PO says that the clutch has only about 7K miles on it. The flywheel 
and the pressure plate are in good condition (well, a bit of overheating on 
the pp, but not much. However, the clutch plate has obviously gotten oily at 
some past time and then been run afterward.

I have read of soaking these in lacquer thinner and resurfacing them with a 
grinder. I hate to toss itk, as it is nearly unwarn, aside from the glaze. 
The archives even tells of a lad who soaked his in gasoline and set it 
afire...numerous times.

Any way to save the clutch plate?

Cheers/Don Carron
