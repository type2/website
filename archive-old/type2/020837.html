Subject: while I'm at it...

Howdy volks.  Pullin' the motor &amp; tranny in my van to do a clutch job,
and am takin' care of some things while the guts are out.

First, I did a compression test, but could only let it idle to warm up
(10-15 mins) due of the clutch issue:

#1: 100 (+5 w/squirt of oil)
#2: 130
#3: 120
#4: 140

Ok, so looks like the right side head will need some work, correct?  The
IPOs (intelligent) saved their receipts for work done.  Looks like the
right head was replaced 5/93 with a rebuilt, in addition to replacing
pistons/cylinders.  Also, the left head was replaced 9/97 again with a
rebuilt.  I also found a receipt with the results of a compression test
from 10/99 (8000mi ago):

#1: 105
#2: 140
#3: 140
#4: 145

So then, is replacing the right side head enough?  Anything in the
details above indicate that more should be done?  This is for a 1700
(CB).

Also, is there really a mechanical advance version of the 050 dizzy in
existence?  Are the part #'s different from the vacuum advance ones? 
I've got an 009 I'd like to swap out for the 050 mechanical.

Taking the time to replace all the cv boots as well.  Stinkin' &quot;German&quot;
ones I put on last fall rotted faster than my halloween pumpkin.  Goin'
with the Rockfords this time; the boot rubber looks a hell of a lot more
durable.

I'm in digest, so feel free to p-mail me.

Many thanks
-Roger
