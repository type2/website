I say:

is that right??  If you hook the wires up backwards on a FI fuel pump it 
will simply RUN BACKWARDS??!!??

If true, then this might be the reason so many people find their fuel filter 
positioned AFTER the FI fuel pump.  They had to turn the fuel pump around 
180 degrees, and to get the different sized hose fittings to match up, they 
HAD to put the fuel filter AFTER the FI fuel pump.

Man, if I am right, then I want a little more respect around here  ;-)  How 
many gold stars do I get??

PS.  It might also be a good way to flush out the FI fuel pump, by running 
it backwards on the workbench..
