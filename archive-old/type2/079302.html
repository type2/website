Subject: Re: [T2] More info on More desirable

Well, if you plan to use the motor from your bug, The
'70 Westy is the easiest swap, and you'd be swapping
in a motor that actually belongs in the van. 

I think faced with these three, and the minimal info
you've given, I probably would choose the '78. 

Oh, and btw, disk brakes came out in '71.

&gt; Wow what a response. Thanks so much. Here is a
&gt; little ( and I mean little
&gt; ) more to go on. All are the same price. I have a
&gt; new motor in my 74 Bug
&gt; to use.
&gt; 
&gt; 70 Westy - No motor, new top, rusted dog legs, dent
&gt; on front face
&gt; 78 Westy - Exterior Fair, Interior good, motor
&gt; leaking _at_ rear Seal, no
&gt; fuel pump = not running
&gt; 74 Sportsmobile - Straight up pop top, body &amp;
&gt; interior low end of fair,
&gt; ignition key missing = not running
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks again,
&gt; Jim 
&gt; PS- I am also new to the list, so if this is
