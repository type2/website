Subject: clutch update

well.. i think its been 2 weeks since i posted last about my clutch,
when i cralled under it, it did look like it was just the cable
streatching, several strands were frayed.. ect ect, i couldent turn the
adjuster nut, so i ordered a new cable, new tube, new clip... replaced
it all. Adjusted it according to bently. the pedal now returns all the
way but it has very little resistance. goes to the floor with the weight
of my foot. i can pull the cluch lever on the trans forward about an
inch with my hand. is this normal? the new wingnut (which i ordered from
my local VW dealer) dosent turn on the end of the cable to easily, im
assumeing this is to prevent it form comeing off, but i really cant turn
it down at all.. prier to all of this there were no unusual noises, i
was just driveing about a mile away from home and the clutch pedle just
went about 2/3'rd of the way down, by the time i was home there was no
clutch at all. I really dont want to pull the engine, being relatively
new to the vw world ive never pulled an engine befor. Any Advice, good
news? ect ect.. i dont need my westy as a daily driver but it is nice to
have on the road.
