Subject: re camper van
Content-Disposition: inline



&gt;My wife's coworker is selling his bus.  Below is his description of the
&gt;bus.  My question has to do with new cylinders.  Is this going to be
&gt;very expensive to replace?  Is $950 a good price for such a bus?  Any
&gt;comments would be greatly appreciated.

&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Durby

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;for $950. Needs new cylinder.  Has new air-flow box, and battery.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;

If the van in on otherwise intact condition (little rust, interior in good
condition) I think this is a fair price.  At worst a rebuilt engine could
be sourced for between 1000 and 1200 dollars.  So with installation you
would have a sound running bus at a cost of _at_ $2500.  You don't know if it
needs suspension, or transmission work.  Does it need exhaust work?  You
will also need to do tune up work add another $50 for that.  While your in
there you might as well replace the clutch another $100.  If you do it
yourself I would remove the engine and disassemble the top end. Inspect
both heads.  Inspect the rest of the pistons and cylinders.  How does he
know it needs a single piston and cylinder? Chances are it will also need
at least one head to be rebuilt.  You can source single pistons and
cylinders, but it can be difficult to find a donor or FLAP who will break a
set.  You would also need new rings for the piston, and that will almost
certainly force you to buy a full set of rings.  Even a cheap fix can
easily cost you a few hundred dollars.

Good luck
Graham
