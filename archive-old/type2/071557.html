&lt;&lt; You wanna be the buyer of a vehicle with just e-
 nough to get it out of the driveway/check cleared?  &gt;&gt;
    Actually, I prefer to buy my buses with the engines already blown, that 
way there's no surprises. I guess I could have been a little more clear. My 
point was that the gentleman had already spent a considerable amount of 
money. If he were to replace the case he's looking at another $400 just for a 
case, plus now he'll need a new bearing set,gasket kit, and who knows what 
else. So what we dont know is his intention, is he going to keep his bus, or 
does he need something now to last a few months or a year or is he planning 
to sell. What I wanted to point out is that some common practices that all 
your big engine builders use, are practices that VW abandoned as leading to 
shorter engine life, line boring being first among them. VW as we know gave 
up on rebuilding cases as uneconomical. So if he rebuilds the engine as it is 
to sell, is he being any less honest then GEX or the rest of them?  My 
opinion is that if you are going to buy a 30plus year old vehicle, then you 
need to expect to do a rebuild even if the owner tells you it's been recently 
done. Ask them by who and have them produce receipts. The receipts will tell 
you whats been done. No or missing receipts? well either expect the worse or 
walk away from the deal.
