Subject: RE: [T2] POR-15 and TK---

&gt;Barry sends:
Regarding putting a bit in a baby food jar and putting
the jar in the 
refrig: I thought it was the AIR in the half empty POR
15 can that 
caused 
the skim to form.
So if you put a big stone in the can to make up for
the POR 15 that was 
removed, you could store it in its original can for a
longer time.  [I 
am 
sure this was brought up before].
It makes sense that the baby food jars would not skim
out if they were 
filled to the rim, without regard to the
refrigerator's effect.&lt;

If anyone needs baby food jars for their projects, I
have a hungry baby... and plenty of empty jars.
