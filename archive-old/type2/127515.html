&gt; How tight should I do the new clamps?

&gt; So they are visibly pinched or just screwdriver snug????

Just until they visibly deform the rubber hose, and no more.  The
outside surface of the hose clamp band should not be below flush with the
undeformed hose.

I try to find the factory style clamps in preference to the US-style
clamps with the worm-drive holes in the strap.
