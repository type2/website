&gt;If you drive only short distances the breather can become clogged up with an
&gt;oil and water mixture.  Take the box off and check the inside to see if its
&gt;full of this tanish mayonaise looking sludge. Its caused by the engine not
&gt;being able to warm up long enough to evaporate the moisture in the oil. I
&gt;have to take mine off and check it every couple of weeks.

I do a lot of short trips in my bus and have been able to reduce the amount of sludge in the oel filler tube by using a rubber seal. There was a lot of debate on the list about whether or not there was a seal put under the cap at the factory and there was. It's very tight fitting and when I do find one they are cracked from age. It's also a little difficult to install because of the threads in the cap.

Now that I have the seal I get less sludge.
