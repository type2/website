Subject: RE: washer pump

I guess should reply to the list before I
get more wiper pump?????? emails

In my friends 71 bug it has the pressure setup that a few
of you talked about. When I bought my bus there was a pump
in between the tank and the sprayer, burnt motor.
Some of you ask me how it was setup....

*       *  &lt;---sprayers
|       |
------------pump-----tank


There is a hole on the dash and I am guessing there was a
switch there, since so many people told me that this setup
wasn't stock... How did the stock lever on the steering
wheel work to let the water spray? Mechanical?

I guess I well just go buy a switch that fits
the hole. I thought I could get the lever to
turn it on and off, o well so much for that
