Subject: RE: wanting dealer service bulletins

I find your request somewhere between meaningless and rediculous.
Do you have any idea how many &quot;technical service informations&quot; there
are? Do you expect me or anyone to fax you a tousand pages pages on a
request as vague as that? I suspect you are refering to the type II ones
only? to 1979? What main group? What sub group?

I do suspect that you are only refering to the publicised technical
service informations. Those are indeed interesting. Even more
interesting are the ones that were never available to the public,
especially the ones marked &quot;confidential&quot;. Some real kneeslappers there.
Those are mostly Bug related though.

So please reconsider your wording &quot;as many as anyone can find&quot;.
