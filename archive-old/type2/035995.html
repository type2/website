Subject: '69 electrical/light probs ....addendum

All,

Okay, after working on the '69 some more with no
further progress, I'll add some info in hopes someone
can offer some advice...


'69 Westy...
~no right rear turn-signal or brake-light
~Both tailights and hazards work
~new (not used) German turn-signal switch/unit 2 years
ago.
~cleaned post connectors on both rear light assemblies
~replaced all female connectors to both assemblies
~cleaned both brake-light switch's connectors (pretty
corroded...lot's of green), cleaned the spade
connectors, sprayed harness plugs with WD-40 and
coated everything with white-lith grease
~bulb, of course
~cleaned the spring-connectors inside bulb socket


I didn't mess with the ground wire, as the tail-light
uses the same ground and it works.

If the brake-light problem is because of the brake
switch (on the master cylinder), wouldn't this affect
*both* lights, instead of just one??? Also, there are
two switches (I love redundancy), so wouldn't it be
unusual that *both* failed, but only on one side?

I will check the switch with a test-light (ran out of
time today), but I don't think that's it.

The brake-light fuse affects both lights, so that's
not it, either.

I suppose it could be a shorted wire, but the exposed
areas (outside of the harness' shrink tubing) seem
fine. Again, I will check this later.


I'm baffled by the turn-signal, too. Like I said, the
switch is fairly new. I suppose it could be the relay,
but I don't know for sure. The fact that the hazards
work, but the right turn-signal does *not* work lead
my ill-educated brain to think this might be it.
(????) Also, when I try the right turn-signal (the
front one works, by the way....I always thought that
when one &lt;front or back&gt; doesn't work, they both don't
work..guess I was wrong), the left signal fluctuates
very slightly, but in time with the click-click-click
coming from the cab...why?


Any help will be greatly appreciated. I won't be
tackling it again until next Monday.
