Subject: More on tools...

I've been meaning to tell this and kept forgetting. Those hammering things
you can use to get frozen axle nuts off? Has a big box wrench on one end
and an anvil thing on the other for beating with a sledge? And nobody knows
what its proper name is?

That tool is aptly called a &quot;slugging wrench.&quot;

Guaranteed to make the young salesters at Sears go looking for the
requisite hardware-department old guy. Naw, they ain't got it.
