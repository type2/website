Subject: Re: [T2]oil coming out of dipstick(update)

Chris m said:

&quot; I would vent the heads (some of the VW heads came this way - Type III I 
think?). Some of the Porsche engines did too. &quot;

Barry said:  something similar

Barry now says:  Venting the heads will reduce the blowby pressure under the 
valve covers.  Excessive pressure under the valve covers will pop the push 
rod tube seals, and may push oil past the valve cover gaskets.  This does 
little to remove the pressure that may be throwing the oil out the dipstick 
tube hole.

Just a thought.
