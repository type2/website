Subject: High Country Bus Festival VI: new gameshow activity

As you may have heard Blistered Dawson will be returing to the High Country 
Bus Festival this year to host the VW Family Feud on Saturday 
Night..............the question survey will be going out to the list soon.

But in addition to the VW Family Feud, this year we will have another game 
show realted activity..........

Have any of you seen the show &quot;Trading Spaces&quot; on TLC, if not check your 
local listings and catch a show.  Basically, the premise of that show is 
that 2 neighbors change homes for one day, and each home owner re-decorated 
one room in the other guy's home.  The best part of it is that the home 
owner has no say what-so-ever in what is done in his home, that is up to his 
neighbor.

well......get ready for TRADING BUSES!  Cliff Styles and Jason ManWaring 
will be helping to run this &quot;gameshow&quot; at HCBF.
here is what we need.

2 brave souls to volunteer their bus and their &quot;labor&quot; to the competition.  
Each person would leave their bus in the hands of the other bus owner.  Each 
bus owner is allowed to get 2 persons on their team to help re-do the other 
persons bus.

Now we are not talking about MAJOR changes here!
The budget does not allow for it.  Perhaps some new curtains, a jump seat,  
who knows??????? that would be up to the participants.(if the owner does not 
object a rattle-can paint job could be done)

If you would like to be a contestant:
1)  send a picture of your bus and include your name and contact info,  
email this to CLIFF STYLES :    Cliff.Styles_at_cmcsg_dot_com
2)  start therapy now,  you may need it
3)  be willing to work hard to make the other compeditors bus nicer than you 
found it!

Once the participants are selected, we will notify the list.  You will be 
given plenty of notice before the event, and we will send pictures of the 
buses in current condition to each other's owner, so they can begin to 
brainstorm about what they might do.  Each participant will be allowed to 
spend 30 bucks on new supplies (prior to event) and will be re-imbersed by 
HCBF at the event.  Each participant will also be allowed to donate USED 
parts themselves, or go scavage for DONATED USED PARTS/ACCESSORIES (maybee a 
westy closet to be put-in a kombie).

At noon on saturday the buses will be taken to secret locations in the 
campground, and the 2 owners will leave their bus in the hands of the other. 
  NO PEEKING.  The owner and his team of 2, will have 5 hours to complete 
their task.  We will have a MASTER MECHANIC on staff for anything that could 
be considered &quot;critical.&quot; He will be at the disposal of both teams.  At 6:00 
pm the work must be done.  The buses will be covered until the un-veiling at 
the end of the Sat Night Awards Ceremony.


If you have any questions about the logistics ect. please email me,   but if 
you would like to be a contestant, please send a picture of your bus to 
CLIFF:  Cliff.Styles_at_cmcsg_dot_com

There will be more info about HCBF to follow soon or as always, check the

thanks,  gobusgo
