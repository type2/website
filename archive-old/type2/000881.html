Hello all

During my engine rebuilt, because of a compression problem (less 30 %), i
noticed that i have an oil leak betwen the case and the cilinder and betwen
the cilinder  and the cilinder head i wounder if this could be the problem
in compression. The valves seem ok even very durty. I would like to replace
the piston rings but i would like to know if it's necesary any special tool
to do this and if i'll have any problems putting the pistons back in the
cilinder.

thank's in advance.
