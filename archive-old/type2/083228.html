&gt; What I was trying to do was, what is prescribed in Bentley:
&gt;
&gt; To test the auxiliary air  regulator, disconnect its fabriccoverd intake air
&gt; hose from the
&gt; large rubber S-shaped duct that joins the intake are sensor with the
&gt; throttle valve housing.
&gt; Then start the enginge (mine would not start - I probably have the wrong
&gt; hose).

No, yopu probably had the corect hose.  The hose you want is ~3/4&quot; in
diameter and runs from the S-hose to the rear right corner of the air dist
box. What bentley does not tell you that you *have* to plug the hole in
the S-duct!  or as Chris says, you have a major leak and hte engine will
not start/run.

&gt; There
&gt; should be vacuum at the disconnected hose, if you cover the hose, the engine
&gt; should slow
&gt; down. After several minutes of operation, the vacumm should diminish and
&gt; eventually
&gt; dissapear almost completely.

Exactly so.

&gt; I will instead try what Tom Young said and start the bus get it to operating
&gt; temp
&gt; shut the bus down, disconnect the hose (assuming that it is the longer of
&gt; the two hoses
&gt; on the aux air reg.) and see if I can blow into it with out turning red,
&gt; poping my ears, clearing my
&gt; sinuses etc.

This should work as well.
