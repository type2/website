Subject: '80 Westy Fabric:  used, but free

I have some original upholstery fabric that came out of my '80 Westy.  It's
tan, with muticolored (blue,green,yellow,tan,etc) rectangles, the vehicle
color is copper-brown if that helps.  The rear seat bottom was trashed but
the back is OK and the cushion cover is in good condition.  If anybody out
there wants it, it's yours for the price of postage, just email me at
