Subject: Cooling tin conundrum...
Message-ID: &lt;PEPALCFBGGCGBAAA_at_zdnetmail_dot_com&gt;

List,
You know what sux? Trying to put the underside cooling tin pieces from a 1975 auto/FI engine onto a 1974 std/carb engine.  Reminds me of that Johhny Cash tune, 'One Piece at a Time'  when he says  &quot;...and when we tried to put in the bolts all the holes were gone.&quot;

Most of it fits, but the piece covering the front of cylinder one won't go because of the presence of the mech. fuel pump.  Looks like i'm gonna have to get rid of the pump and fab a coverplate unless i can order something like that.

I'm just blabbin, really.
I guess my question would be:
Provided all of the other tin is in place and secure(engine seal included), will i overheat if i leave this piece of tin off the engine?

thanx volks,
