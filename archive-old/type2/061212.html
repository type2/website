&gt;When testing the solenoid, I tried the wire that feeds in
&gt;the edge of the cover plate, it was not hot.  
&gt;Should I supply power via a jumper to see if the winding
&gt;is shot?  If I do that will the solenoid cycle with
&gt;repetitive clicks or simply click once?
&gt;thanks for your time and patience.

Oly,

If you need a wiring diagram send me your address and I'll mail a copy.  In
the absence of a wiring diagram, testing the solenoid might be confusing
since both positive and negative wires on your heater are probably the same
color, but you can also identify the wires with an ohm meter.  The wire that
goes from the solenoid winding through the notch in the circular plate and
is screwed to the center of that plate is ground.  The green wire that exits
the plate via a drilled hole and ducks into a small harness with a couple
other wires is the positive.   Where it exits the harness, that green wire
meets a brown wire (to the fuel pump) via a black screw terminal.  You can
either disconnect this screw terminal and give the winding its 12 volts with
your test clip/jumper via this green wire directly, or simply use your test
clip to give 12 volts to one of the terminals on the overheating switch (the
two poles under the flame switch).  You should hear a single, hearty click
from the solenoid if the winding isn't dead.  When doing this test, as with
any other test around the gas heater, remember you could generate a spark so
keep gasoline and its fumes contained.

Here's how the current travels:  When the blower motor is operating, its
contact points pulse the ignition coil, which via the #4 terminal on the
terminal strip passes current through the overheating switch, the
temperature regulating switch and then on to the fuel pump and solenoid. The
solenoid opens a fuel valve whenever it's delivered that pulse and then
closes again via spring pressure.  So unless the motor is spinning you won't
get a repetitive click. 

While you're dealing with the pressure regulator here's other point of
interest (that's included in my impending online updates).  The solenoid
side of the housing is joined to the regulator half via four phillips screws
(that are visible when you remove the single screw holding the cap over the
winding and remove the winding).  When you remove these four screws and pull
the solenoid housing apart (careful, there's a spring and solenoid valve
waiting to pop out!) you'll find a rubber O-ring sealing the housing halves
together.  That O-ring is yet another leak point to worry about on the early
BN4.  You'll probably also notice that the contact surface of the valve is a
potential leak point.  I haven't had sealing problems with the valve face on
my heater yet so I haven't devised a fix.  However, for an ounce of
prevention, it is worth installing a new O-ring (one rated for fuel use)
before yours decides to leak.

Good luck,

Ron
