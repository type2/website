&gt; Our Govt. insurance here in Manitoba has reduced insurance if you

&gt; Far too expensive to install. Maybe can't even be done in such an old
&gt; vehicle.

my insurance (Metlife) also gives a discount if there is an &quot;active&quot; theft
deterrent system.  they physically checked my bus when I put in a hidden
start switch that has to be held down for the ignition to work to make
sure it met their requirements but they gave me the 5% discount, every
little bit helps.  although the only reason I think they might want my bus
is for the canoe on the roof........;8*_at_
