Janyce &amp; Bill,

I replaced all my windows as the last step in restoring a '79 last year. I bought all new rubber from RMMW which changed the 
rubber from the groove with silver/plastic insert strip to the &quot;cal look&quot; without the strip. Much cheaper rubber! 

Anyway the sides and backs went in great. Hint, get a installation rope or string or whatever they call it from a glass shop. 
It is the only way to go. 

I had the front windshield installed in a shop for $100 installed (I provided the rubber) and the guy had a h%^&amp; of a time. 
With both of us pushing and pounding we got it in. I would recommend having a shop do this if you can. If you break your own 
windshield, your dime. If they break it, your blessing. The side ones are easy. I used dishsoap diluted about 1:4 for 
lubrication. Just clean it up after installation. 

Anyway, I talked the installation guy into giving me his rope. It's about 1/8&quot; across and fits right into the groove that 
overlaps the body lip when pulled from outside to the inside. Have somebody push from the outside as you pull the string into 
the inside as the flap of rubber is pulled over the lip of the body. This rope has a woven plastic cover that slips perfectly 
across the rubber lip. Be careful that the pusher from the outside doesn't push so hard that the rope can't get out of the 
groove and over the metal edge. The rope can actually cut the rubber lip and that spot will not only look bad but may not seal 
so hot either.

There's probably some better descriptions in the archives but that' just my $.02 worth.
Good luck,
Joel '71 transporter
