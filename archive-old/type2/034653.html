Volks,

It is my sad duty to report that the gathering this coming weekend in LA
will not occur.  Nikki's Dad passed away this afternoon at about 4 PM PST.  
As a result, Nikki and I are postponing the gathering and picnic to a
later date, probably around GW's Birthday.  While I would love to meet up
with all of you, this weekend is not the time for it.

Condolences can be sent to Nikki at shrike3_at_earthlink_dot_net.  I was
privileged to meet her dad last weekend and he was a heck of a man.  I
only met him once but will miss him all the same.
