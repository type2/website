Subject: Free 2 person middle seat.

Consider this my gift to the list.

I have a 2 person middle seat that is at my fathers house, and he'd like
gone.  It is in decent condition, no major rips, but will need some
cleaning, mold, ect.  I haven't seen it in a year or so but I remember
no rips in the cover.

I live in Annapolis Maryland and who ever what's it and can figure out
shipping can have it for the cost of shipping.  Or if you come and get
it, is yours for free.

I have no need for it as I have been converted to a camper guy.

Happy Holidays

Brent
