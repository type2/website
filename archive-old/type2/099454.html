Find yourself a welding shop and have them weld it.

Try the yellow pages or visit a good machine shop and ask them for a welder 
recommendation. Do NOT use a muffler shop. Those guys have never done very 
good welds for me. Fortunately I can weld so I seldom need anyone to do it 
for me.

Another option is check with your local vo-tech school and see if they can 
do it for you or point you in a good direction.

Be sure to fix up the beaten metal in the fenderwell. Don't want any rust 
to start.

Good luck!!!
