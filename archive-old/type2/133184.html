Subject: Re: [T2] Re: California smog revision, vary un-cuth questions

I'll probably get harassed by the admins for this on this thread, but it 
brings up a question that I have never found an answer to.

Why do people continue to live in a place that does not serve them well.

If you are starving, why stay?  If you love something that someone in that
area wants to take away from you thru legislative means, why not move?

If you live someplace with bodily threats that you can't see 
coming(earthquakes), why would you stay?

I've been to California and literally cannot understand the big 
draw...but, I'm not a fan of places(like LA) with a gazillion people 
either.

Why in the heck would you stay someplace like that that irritates you 
daily?  I'm not suggesting that you migrate east, but someplace with
laws that don't conflict with your love of VW's.  Pretty soon, the folks 
in California will end up with a monoculture...really bad for the 
environment and for sanity.  

Americans are some of the most mobile people on the planet, and yet...
there is some large percentage that have never been over 50 miles from 
where they were born....

Official notice: this email does not require any answers.&lt;grin&gt;
                 *especially* on listserv bandwidth.

Cheers, dave

&gt; 
&gt; Wishful thinking. :-)
&gt; 
&gt; If they don't get sold out of state via eBarf they get loaded into
&gt; containers and leave the sea ports for the &quot;breakers&quot; in Europe. Then years
&gt; from now you'll be buying the parts back from them at inflated prices and
&gt; exchange rates.
