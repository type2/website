Subject: Re: aftermarket radio installation

Bought a nice radio w/cassette at COSTCO for $60 with two speakers. It
was slightly larger than dash opening in my 70 van. I hand-filed bottom
of opening to remove an eighth inch or so and squared corners of
opening. Fits fine.

&gt; can anyone give me some info on installing an aftermarket radio in a '74 Westy? I would like to use the stock dash radio opening, however the opening is a little small.  I need to make it wider &amp; taller.  I have tried using a file, but that's just too slow.  Any ideas on the easiest way to get that opening the size I want it without tearing up that nice original dash?
&gt; 
&gt; Also, I have seen the under-dash type radio holders advertised in lots of places - but I have only seen these for bugs.   Is there a place that sells them for buses? I guess my only other option would be installing the radio in the glove box...any hints/ideas/tips are much appreciated.
