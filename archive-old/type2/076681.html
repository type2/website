Subject: kill VWOA thread please

It's been  on going for years and will be for years to come.  We all have our 
opinions, but the law is the law and  after the dope smoking hippy generation 
set the stereotype for the bus crew so should we not do the same by standing 
out and being rebellious on this issue.  It's workable.
Peace Out
