&gt; I had the same problem with my Saab 99...I quickly learned to always
park at
&gt; the top of a hill.

 Yup, that's always a good workaround! :-)

&gt; Just a bonehead guess here, but it sounds like it might be a
vapor-lock
&gt; problem.

 I don't think so: Cosmo said it would click and not turn over, with
a vapour lock it would spin but not start: I'd think an iffy electrical
connection to the starter/solenoid is more likely. I think the archives
would have more detail but the first fix I'd try would be to disconnect
the battery, get under the bus and undo the solenoid connections (one
at a time to prevent confusion) and get them clean &amp; shiny with whatever
combination of wire brush, solvents and sandpaper comes to hand.

&gt; I've heard, but never actually tried, that putting wooden clothes
&gt; pins on the fuel line will diffuse the heat &amp; keep the gas from
vaporizing in
&gt; the lines.

 I'm also skeptical about this fix- I can't see it working.

Cheers,
