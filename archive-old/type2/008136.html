Phil underwent a liver transplant Thursday afternoon.   He is recovering nicely.

                                         From Rolling Stone
                            Phil Lesh: More Than One More Saturday Night
  New livers don't generally top most peoples' Christmas wish lists, but it appears that Santa has brought former Grateful Dead
 bassist Phil Lesh an early gift this holiday season. Lesh underwent a successful liver transplant Thursday (Dec. 17) at the Mayo
  Clinic of Jacksonville, Fla. Lesh has already been moved out of the intensive care unit and is recuperating from the surgery. He
 will, however, likely remain at the clinic for at least another week, according to band spokesman Dennis McNally. &quot;So far his body
 has accepted the liver. It's not all over, but he's doing quite well,&quot; McNally said. Lesh required the transplant after discovering in
 1992 that he'd contracted Hepatitis C; it's unknown how he got the disease. In September, the Hepatitis caused internal bleeding,
 which in turn severely damaged Lesh's liver. Due to his otherwise clean bill of health, it's likely Lesh will have a speedy recovery.
 &quot;He's been Mr. Health since the early Eighties: no drugs, no alcohol, he's a vegetarian and a total family man,&quot; McNally says. &quot;He
                         should be able to lead a totally normal life.&quot; Keep on truckin'...
