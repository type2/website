Subject: Re: [T2] Drum brake star adjuster

roberto
stick a fat flathead screwdriver sideways in the slot and crank the screw
part down into the star.
either it will bind and break it loose or it will bottom
out and break it loose.
you might want to spray it with penetrating oil first but you dont have
to.
i usually clean them up with the dremel and a mini wire wheel and coat
them with grease.
