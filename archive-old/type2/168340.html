Subject: What's your MPG

Since I got Zoey on the road, I have to admit that the trips to the
gas station are a lot more frequent than I have become accustom to
having owned cars that got 35MPG or had 16 gallon tanks.

I tracked my mileage for the last couple of fill-ups and got 17 and
then 16.5 last night. Now my office is 25 miles from my home, and I am
doing some pretty fast driving (up to 80) to keep up with traffic or
just because I can. However, when I filled up last night and got 16.5,
I decided that my lead foot would be no more. I figured that Zoey is
32 years old, runs well, but is still old and just because I CAN  do
80 on a straightaway doesn't mean I should! Granted, I am sure that
the camper top adds a little more weight and wind resistance, but
16.5... Holy crap!

So I am curious what other are doing to get the best fuel efficiency
(aside from just going slower and making sure their buses are tuned
up) and what your current MPG is?

I love the fact that she is running so well (despite some other
quirks) but I feel that my mileage kind of sucks.
