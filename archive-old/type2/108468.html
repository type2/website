Subject: a VW save.......I think

    This past Monday, Memorial Day, I got a phone call from from Jeff
and Joanne of Colorado.  They had gotten our phone number from the
NEATO-LiMBO Transporter Tourist &amp; Traveler Directory.  It seems they
are traveling in their Vanagon and were getting a lound &quot;clunking&quot;
noise from the back of the bus.  Jeff seemed sure it was a CV joint in
need of attention.  Since they were staying at a local campground here
on Long Island I offered to grab my VW toolbox and come give them a
hand.  Jeff had a different idea, even though he's delt with CV joints
before, this time he just wanted the names of local shops.  He said
something about going sight seeing in New York City while their bus
was being repaired.  So, I gave them the names of 4 shops in the area.
    I hope it's good that I haven't heard from them since.
