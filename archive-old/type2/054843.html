I've had the same problem for a few years.  I even rebuilt what was a
relatively
low time carburetor.  I still think it is a carburation problem, but I don't
know what. I have to stand on the gas pedal while cranking or it won't
start.
And, like you, I've never been stranded as it always starts.  I've
considered
replacing the carburetor, but haven't quite made up my mind.

&gt; very difficult (and kinda embarassing) to fill up on gas, stop at the post

it
&gt; does when cold.  Eventually, it will always start though, I've never been
&gt; stranded because of this.
