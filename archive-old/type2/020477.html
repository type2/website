Subject: Rebuilding a 1972, 1700 with dual carb

Listees,

I have recently purchased a 72 Westy and I am considering doing a
rebuild on the engine.  It has the original 1700 dual carb (solex).

I bought it knowing that it was only firing on three cylinders with the
hopes of it being something simple.

I have checked for spark and everything is fine.

Would the valves be the next logical step?

Could it be they just need to be adjusted or something worse?

If it is the vavles or the heads and since I do not know the history of
the motor would it be best to go beyond the quick fix and rebuild?

If so, where should I look for such a rebuild kit?

What should be included in it?  And more importantly how much will I
have to pay?

I do hope to keep the bus original but if the rebuild means a few extra
horses I'm ok with that too.

Any advice would be appreciated.
