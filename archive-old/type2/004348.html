&gt; Here's an off the wall question for the *real* experts.  I'm acquiring a
&gt; '70 Westy.  It needs a power brake booster.  I have an '83.5 wasserboxer
&gt; vanagon parter.  Booster is still there.  Can I use it on the '70?

?????
A 70 was the last year for large 5/drum brakes all the way around.
71 got small 5 wheels with disc brakes in the front and a booster.

Are you SURE it is a 70??
