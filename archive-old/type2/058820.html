Subject: 78 exhaust

Please excuse my ignorance here.  My question/problem.  When I got the
camper the heat exchanger and exhaust system from there had been removed
and replaced with cherry bomb mufflers.  Dual exhaust.  Wanting to
eliminate some of the noise, I replaced the cherry bombs with standard
mufflers from my local NAPA.  Still very loud!  My question is if the
heat exchanger also acted as a muffler and it needs to be reinstalled?
