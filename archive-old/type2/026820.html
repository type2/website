just wondering if any list members knew of an extra friendly and reliable, 
trustworthy mechanic in the chicagoland area.  I am pondering buying a bus 
that has been parked in my neighborhood for a few months now and was hoping 
i could have a mechanic take a look at it for me since it would be my first 
vw purchase. any help would be appreciated.
thank you,
mike-
