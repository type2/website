Well, bay-window Buses do have some variation of heat exhausters.  When the
VWs were new, they were basically air-tight.  You couldn't shut the door on
a Beetle unless you cracked the window first.  In later years they added
flow-through ventilation.  On Beetles, this is seen as a crescent-shaped
black vent on each side behind the rear quarter window.  The inside vents
are on either side of the rear window.

On a Bus they did a similar thing.  If you look at the bottom of each front
door there is a black plastic grille with a blue slider.  This is your
exhauster.  Slide it forward, and you have flow-through ventilation.  If
your seals are tight enough and you slide it backwards to close each
exhauster you may hear a buzzing noise from the exhauster and you should
notice a slowdown in the amount of air that comes in through the heat or
ventilation system.

I'm not sure what drove VW to make the exhauster manually operated in the
Bus but they did.  But yes, we have 'em.

&gt; body exhausters, which promote better ventilation. One of the
&gt; problems with the heat system in a bus is that even when you fix all
&gt; the leaks, the incoming heat has nowhere to go. Opening a window can
&gt; help, but the real fix would be to locate exhausters in a negative
&gt; pressure area. Exhausters are essentially one way valves. All new
&gt; cars have them, and they are usually located under the rear bumper
&gt; cover surround, in or around the tail lights, or, on some cars, under
&gt; a grille (that seems to be decorative) along the rear sides of the
&gt; car. They are crucial to proper climate control.
