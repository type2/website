Subject: Re: [T2] Running hot

[...]
I have found that my 82 westy running down the highway or around town 
for that distance will climb to 230 to 250. during a cool night it drops 
to 220 to 230.  Didnt have an operating oil temp guage in the westy last 
winter so i dont know what the winter temps will run yet.
as  to the light, your oil may be too  light.  20w50 in a synth is 
supposed to be good all year round except in the furthest north.  
Personally in the summer i use 40 or 50 single weight and switch to 
20w50 synth for winter use (denver, co)
BTW oil and tire use are very heavy subjects here.  take suggestions 
with large grain of salt.
