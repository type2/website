Subject: more on heat

Was going to call this message &quot;more heat&quot; but that's a sacred phrase that
all the aircooled owners would read rather than delete.

Look at this great waterfall!  We can put a big paddlewheel right over here
and use the water's energy to turn two big stones against each other so 
we can get some heat!
