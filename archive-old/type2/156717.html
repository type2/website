Subject: front end blues

I just got back from a trip to Central Oregon (trip note to follow).  A
disturbing heavy knocking sound started under the passenger seat, and I
traced it to the lower ball joint.  Fellow-listee Hal indicated that
the ball joints were going to need replacing, so this doesn't come as
too much of a surprise.  After checking the library, and the archives,
I faxed an order to bus-boys for the rebuilt torsion arms with the ball
joints pressed in.  I am planning on adding one of those EMPI
sway-bars, since I have to pull the old one off anyway.  This got me
thinking (always dangerous)... while I have the whole thing in pieces,
are there any other bits that should get replaced since getting them
off later will be a real PITA.  For example, should I replace the
tie-rod ends?  Steering dampener?  Any other ideas?  I just redid the
front brakes, so I'm not planning to open up the brakes nor the
bearings.
I just figured, the cost of the additional parts at this point is
minimal compared to the time it would take to pull the front end apart
again any time soon.
Any advise welcome - on both the front end teardown (library most
helpful) and the replacement part suggestions.  I may not be back on
until tomorrow - I still have to empty the bus of gear :)  Great trip
though, even with the sketchy steering.  I'll post a report tomorrow.
