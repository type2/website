&gt; Here's a funny one.  This past weekend (on my maiden camping voyage) I 
&gt; shut
&gt; the sliding door and the whole thing fell off.  Upon closer inspection 
&gt; it
&gt; appears the &quot;roller&quot; on what I think is called the &quot;rear support&quot; 
&gt; broke.  It
&gt; is shaped like two washers joined in the middle or &quot;U&quot; shaped if 
&gt; looking at it
&gt; from the side.  This thing broke in two and one half fell to the 
&gt; ground.
&gt; We were able to get the door back in the tracks, close it, and lock it 
&gt; for a
&gt; safe journey home.  It just made accessing the back of the bus a 
&gt; little more
&gt; difficult for the duration of the trip.
&gt; Does anyone know what this part I'm describing is called (or better 
&gt; yet a part
&gt; #) or if they are available.  I wasn't sure if this might be sold as a 
&gt; unit or
&gt; if just the broken piece of metal could be replaced.

This happened to me on the way home from a backpacking trip last month. 
  The roller split in two and the inside half was lodged inside the 
track.  The door still worked, but poorly.

I ordered a new one from Bus Depot 
http://busdepot_dot_com/busdepot/details.jsp?partnumber=211843419

I also ordered the guidepiece 
http://busdepot_dot_com/busdepot/details.jsp?partnumber=211843368

I also ordered the weatherstrip 
http://busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=211829193C

In the process of taking everything apart and putting it all back 
together, other items fell apart (does this sound familiar anyone?)

A lot of the components of the rear support/hinge are pot metal and 
subject to breakage (esp. after 30+ years of use).

I wound up ordering two more parts, this time from Busted Bus 
http://www.bustedbus_dot_com/

I needed an operating cam and a pivot piece.  These parts are shown in 
the Bentley Manual, page 25 of the BODY AND FRAME section, figure 5-57 
at the bottom of the page, numbers 13 &amp; 15.

If you don't have a Bentley Manual, get one - it will pay for itself 
the first day.

Now, a month later, I have everything back together and it is &quot;like 
buttah&quot; - slicker than owlshit.
