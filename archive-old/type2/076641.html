&gt; My questions:
&gt; 1. Can anyone explain the mechanism inside the thermostat? It must be more
&gt; than a bimetallic strip.  The force on the plunger must be quite strong to
&gt; counteract that long spring.

It's called a &quot;wax pellet&quot; thermostat.  Expanding wax pushes a plunger in
and out to open and close the flap.

&gt; 2. Does anyone happen to have a thermostat + plunger to sell me?

No, but I live quite happily with my inoperative thermostat.  I wired the
flap in the open position and simply remove and reinstall the hot air tube
at either end of the hot months.
