So what can you use for additional heat?  In my '78 bus in Wisconsin its 
really cold.  Really cold.  This weekend I had to open up the front to 
close the air vents amnually since that little plastic piece between 
them broke and the one was just always open.  Last winter I didn't even 
think about it but I'm excited about this winter at least having less 
COLD air inside the bus.  What I'm considering is hanging a clear shower 
curtain up right behind the front seats (since whoever's in the back can 
keep pretty warm with blankets, each other, etc.) and just try to 
maximize the defrost function in the dash.  My lighter's broken but I 
was thinking about putting in a new one and gettting one of those little 
car heaters they sell at K-mart.  What do other people do?
