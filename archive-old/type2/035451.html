Subject: initial pressurisation of hydrolic valves.

Hello everyone,
I just got my friends 76 engine with hydrolic valves back together. I still 
have a little bit to figure out with the FI system, but there is something 
thats bothering me. Its the valves. There just seems to be way too much slack 
in the gap. I know that the lifters are empty, and dont expect them to pump 
up till the engine is cranked. It just seems like the push rods are about a 
half an inch too short. I did the same thing with my 79 engine as I have done 
to his (new piston rings, pushrods, gasket sets, etc...) but didnt have all 
the slack in the valves that i'm experiencing with his. It just makes me feel 
that i may break a rod or cause some unneccesary damage by trying to start it.
   Anybody have any advice through any experiances with this sort of thing?  

Matt O.
