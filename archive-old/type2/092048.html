Subject: Cantrell's tome on aux battery and relay

I respectfully disagree with Dave Schwarze's implication  that you will
fry the small gauge wiring when trying to start a dual battery when the
aux is discharged-in fact using a heavier wire is dangerous:  this was
settled by Beckett Cantrell in his post on aux bastt safety:
     &quot;Right then. Let us start with the safety issue. In theory, the
safest way to charge an automotive or marine or aircraft batt.(24v in
the case of the latter) or any wet cell storage device( and for those of
you running gel or AGM batt.'s, hold on, I'll get to them in a bit...),
whilst said batt is in-situ, would be with a nice, steady, low amp
constant charge. In the real world, this just ain't how it goes down.
Given the nature of alternators, and the various demands of an
automotive enviornment, what happens is that you get a big thumping
surge of amps,(say, right after you disengage the starter) followed
shortly there after by a much &quot;softer&quot; rate of charge. Now lets throw
our deeply discharged aux. batt. into the picture. If you've got it
wired in with a chunk of thumb sized cable, then that sucker is gonna
suck up all the amps it can get. This does two very bad things: 1) As
the aux. batt.  is drained, it is going to, for lack of a better word,
act as a shunt.( picture jump starting a car with a dead batt. If you
connect a good batt.  directly to the terminals of the dead batt.,
chances are that the car with the dead batt. will crank over slowly. But
if you connect the good batt. to the ground of the car with the dead
batt. and the hot lead of the starter solinoid, that puppy will fire
right up.)  When you turn the key, current is not only going to try to
go to a Demand device, like the starter, but will also try to equalize
the charge between the cranker batt., and the aux. batt.  (Now remember,
folks, we're talking about using a relay here, not an isolator, which
has its own inherent problems, like voltage drop across the diodes...)
This may result in the vehicle not starting. If you do get the beastie
to start, we come to Very Bad Thing number 2) Bosch and Motorola
alternators absolutely HATE having to supply anything close to their
&quot;Rated&quot; out-put. Let's just say you've got a Bosch 65amp alt. in your
Brick. You think &quot;...65amps, well thats more than enough to handle the
demands of my system...&quot; but what you might not know is that 65amp
rating is at 100% duty cycle. Your actual usable out-put is ½ to 2/3 the
total rated out-put. So, now you've down to 32-45amps, usable. But wait,
is it hot out? Yes? Then cut another 15-25% off of those numbers. Now
you start to sweat(pardon the pun).  What it comes down to is that your
alt., under normal conditions, has its hands full just running the stock
systems of your rig. Add in an aux. batt.  wired in with a relay and
monster cable, and that alt. will let out its &quot;smoke&quot; in no time flat.
And I do mean smoke. The fire hazzard is real. That is why using a small
relay and small ga. wire to charge the aux. batt. is much safer. Think
of it this way. If some pissy little 18ga wire under your dash shorts
out, you'll see some sparks, and think&quot;...Well, rat poop. There goes the
connection to my spiffy little motor driven dashboard hula-girl...&quot; If a
2ga. cable shorts, you've got a very large arc welder on the loose. Not
pretty at all. To sum it up: A relay in the 15-30amp range, wired in
with 12ga connections is fine. Hella errs on the side of caution, and
who could blame them? A big 75amp relay, and 4or 2ga. cable is simply
asking for an expensive and dangerous problem.
    Now lets tackle the issue of batt.'s and charging when applied to a
relay controlled dual set up, where you've got a standard automotive
type cranker batt. and an aux. deep cycle batt. To wit: Your
run-of-the-mill cranker batt.(wet cell) is very happy when it is allowed
to do one job, that being to give up large amounts of current for a
short period of time, and to be recharged with the same, ie, short
recharge period at high amps. This happens whenever you start your eng.
It then goes about the task of holding on to its charge, while the alt.
keeps the other bits going, until you need a little extra bump, like
when you turn on the headlights, or fire up that new roof rack mounted
Death Ray. Then the batt. takes another hit, the alt. sees this, gives
another short burst of high current flow, and things settle down.  The
deep cycle aux. batt(also wet cell), on the other hand, is loath to do
this. It is happy with a nice steady rate of discharge, and recharge. So
it would seem that we've got a problem, eh? Yup, we do. If the aux.
batt. is deeply discharged, and you're wired up with massive relays and
cable, it's     gonna die a quick death. And so is your cranker batt.,
and ditto for the alt.  itself. Remember, alt.'s are stupid devices. All
they do is sense demand, and keep puting out the amps till said demand
is met. So not only is the aux.  batt. getting way too much juice, so is
the cranker, and that alt. of yours is working at its limit(100% Duty
Cycle) to supply the needs of the aux.          batt. Bad, bad, bad.(
Okay, here's the part for you Optima, gel-cell and AGM folks) These   
batt.s, both cranker and deep cycle, handle the above situation pretty
darned well. &quot;..Oh, good...That's what I've got, so no
problems...Right?&quot; Wrong. Your alt. is still frying itself. So now we
come to the solution. It is not a perfect one, but it is an even trade
off between component and batt. life, safety and re-charge time. Its the
use of a moderate relay and lighter gauge wiring. Pretty simple, eh?
Unfortunately, you just can't have your cake, and eat it too. If you
want to help out the situation, get a regulated 120vAC to 12vDC power
supply, in an amp range that suits your needs, and wire it in to your
system. If your camped in an area with hook-ups, the power supply will
switch on when it senses 120vAC, and by-pass your aux. batt. If your out
in the boonies, well then, you've got to make due with what you've got.
And the small relay/small wire system is about the best compromise you
can get. Please feel free to ask any questions that y'all might still
have.
     First, I'm really surprised that among all of the list members,
there is not one single Electrical Engineer who stepped forward to
explain this relay dilemma. So I'll give it to you in a nut shell: Guess
what folks, if your aux batt. is deeply discharged, and you're running
2ga. wire and a 75amp relay, the batt. will most likely draw 75 amps(or
whatever your alt. can put out) at initial surge. But if you're running,
lets say, a Hella relay, rated at 15amps, with the wiring provided, and
with the same deeply discharged aux.  batt., you are most likely gonna
draw about 12amps at initial surge, and much lower after a short period
of time. It's all related to the Gauge of the Wire. Really. Don't buy
it? Try this: Take that same deeply discharged batt.  and run a really,
really tiny gauge wire directly from the positive post of your cranker
batt., to the positive post of the afore mentioned discharged batt. Now
start the engine. Did the wire smoke? Have the flames reached the
cockpit? Are you searching for that fire extinguisher(that is also
probably deeply discharged!)? NOPE. Your dead batt. will draw what the
wire can provide. Still don't belive me? Okay, lets see what VW did from
the factory:
On older models equipped with dual batts, the relay was rated at 15amps(
I'm holding the original one out of my ' 79 Delux in my hand as we
speak) and the wire from said relay to the aux batt is 12ga. Believe me
folks, nothing can suck down a batt like the old style Dometic 12v/120v
fridges found in the pre-Vanagon Type 2's, and even when these batts are
totally discharged, starting your eng. does not cause a pyrotechnic
display. If it did, VW would have been litigated out of existence by
now. If that still doesn't convince you, well just flip through the
pages of  Brightons Studies in Electron Flow ( My God, how I loathed
that damn book when I was in college...) to get a clearer picture. Your
dead batt will only suck up as much as much juice as a given wire will
flow. The batt. is not an active device, like an electric motor, but a
passive one, and will not suck your cranking batt dry at start-up
(Unless you are running Massive gauge wire to the aux. batt. That is
exactly why VW went with smaller relays and wire gauge.) Think of the
set-up as a &quot;trickle charger&quot;. Okay, enough already.&quot;
