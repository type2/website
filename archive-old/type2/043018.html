Content-Disposition: inline

We are leaving our of Charlotte, and are looking for caravan as well.  Anyone? Anyone? Buler? .... Also, since this will be our 1st ever &quot;bus event&quot;, I have a few concerns.  Basically, our bus is up to the trip w/o a problem, but not totally restored, and still needs a lot of work.  Are these types of things just more for show, or is it a get together of fellow bus owners, no matter what the condition of the bus?  I don't want to be the ugly duckling of the crowd!  Thanks volks!  Have a wonderful day!

Hey-

Sorry to bug the list with such a specific request. Think
of it as a pre-emptive AIRS post :^)

I am looking for caravan mates leaving from the Durham,
NC area on Saturday morning. Anyone?

thanks...
