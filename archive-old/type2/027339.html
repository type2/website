Thank you to all that gave advise on getting my 76 going again.

One of the hoses coming from the intake manifold came off, and found a few 
other hoses that must have blown off when it was backfiring.
I reconnected the first hose I found, wouldn't start, then finally found the 
last two, the larger of which coming from the intake manifold and 
reconnected those and she fired right up!!!

Now that my faith is renewed in my new bus, I am going to finally give it a 
name.

From now on, my 1976 chrome yellow westfalia will be known as Jasper!

What I know of the yellow jasper stone :
The yellow jasper carries the sun's rays, and holds a masculine energy. The 
yellow also can be used to assist and protect you during times that you 
travel, this can mean both the physical or spiritual means of traveling. It 
is a stone of protection and shields you from negativity. It is good for 
warding away depressions.



so thanks again, to those that offered up their suggestions.

Christopher
76 westy &quot;Jasper&quot;

&gt;Hello listmembers,
&gt;
&gt;I have officially ran into the first problem with my new bus that kept me
&gt;from being able to even get it home.
&gt;Yesterday I drove all over the city running errands, and everything was
&gt;running wonderfully. Then, as I left my house last night it was really hard
&gt;to start, it would initially fire then die instantly. I got it going and
&gt;drove down the road a while, but it would keep puttering and backfiring
&gt;along the way, so I stopped. Then it would not even run for a little bit if
&gt;I gave it gas when it would fire, but she would just die instantly anyway.
&gt;
&gt;Warning, novice comments ahead :
&gt;
&gt;So, I did what I could at the moment, in the dark anyway. I checked the 
&gt;plug
&gt;wires, and the distributor cap, and all of that was still perfectly solid.
&gt;
&gt;I am not sure where to start, and will be pulling out the Muir book for 
&gt;some
&gt;guidance, any suggestions would be appreciated.
&gt;From what it is doing, I am guessing that im not running on all 4 all of a
&gt;sudden, but im in the dark as to how/why it would have happened, and how
&gt;major this is going to be.
&gt;
&gt;So the race is on now besides, the bus is stuck at my house (after towing 
&gt;it
&gt;back there) and I have to get from SF to Bend OR on thursday.
&gt;
&gt;Should be interesting.......
&gt;
