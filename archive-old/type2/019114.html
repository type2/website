Oh, thanks. I feel better now. I also got a call from David S. who went
through the same sort of thing with a totalled car here in CA. He also
said don't accept any offers unless you get to keep your bus. Because I
WON'T accept any other offer. I'm not giving her up. She's totally
fixable. And she's just the best!!!

The insurance claim thing was such a scam!!! The guy looked at the
front, looked at the inside, disappeared, and came back with this
print-out that says right at the bottom, &quot;EZEst - A product of CCC
Information Services Inc.&quot; Which leads me to believe this is just some
boilerplate computer estimating thing which ONLY calculates worst case
scenarios! Part of the quote includes .2 hours each to &quot;R&amp;I RT/LT Mirror
outside&quot; and .5 hours each to &quot;R&amp;I RT/LT Handle w/cyl &amp; keys&quot;!!!
(Totally unnecessary.) Oh, and a clear coat for the paint is included in
the estimate! Ahhh-haaa-haaaa!!! And $90 for &quot;glass sunshade.&quot; (I don't
have one.)

I'm beginning to see the humor in this.

&gt; My 78 Westy (the green monster) was totaled also. I still own it. I
&gt; bought it back for $25. Although my westy is not fixable, there was
&gt; no salvage title issued. I just told them I was going to fix it and
&gt; would not accept any of their offers unless this was part of the
&gt; deal.
