	Dan,
	If you've already unbolted the CVs and shifter, I'd go ahead
and pull the tranny. If you can afford it, get the input shaft and
final drive seals replaced or  do 'em yourself, get a new throw-out 
bearing to go with the new clutch and drain the old tranny oil and 
replace with fresh.
	Having installed just an engine and an engine and tranny
already bolted together I'd DEFINATELY recomend putting them together
first and installing as a pair.

	Bill
