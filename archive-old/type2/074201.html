Subject: Re: [T2] Re:  N.A.D.A.

I have to agree with Greg here.  In fact, I don't really want Busses to be
worth too much(flame suit on).  One of the big drawing cards to owning a Bus
is they are relatively easy to buy and maintain.  And good people abound
that add positively to the Bus experience.  If I want a car that is
expensive to own and maintain, with snobs to deal with and hard to find
parts, I'll go get some other obscure European car.

By the way, did anyone see the 69 Westy on a certain electronic bartering
board?  What a surprise to go through the pictures and see it's had the
Corvair conversion.

&gt;I'm not counting on Insurance Co's wanting to help us.
&gt;
&gt;My bet is that if they increase the $$$ value on our buses, they're going
to
&gt;ask more $$$ for the premiums to cover their increased risk.
&gt;
&gt;And it can also inflate the expectations of the guy with the
&gt;rusting-to-pieces westy in his back 40 such that no-one will ever be able
to
&gt;get him to part with it until it's too far gone for anything but a photo
&gt;album and the crusher. We already have too many of those guys in these
&gt;parts, asking $2K and up for a bus with more rust than metal. And I'm
&gt;talking severe *ONTARIO* rust, where you can put your hand through the
frame
&gt;members without even pressing hard.
