Is bead blasting pistons a common practice? Seems it would be possible to
have residual blasting media stuck in the small passageways in the piston
and come loose and damage the engine. There are many horror stories of
powder coated oil canisters depositing residual glass beads into and
destroying a newly rebuilt engine.
