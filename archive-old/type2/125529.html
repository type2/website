Subject: 73 to FI

OK I just got a 78 FI standard 2 L engine and want to put it in my 73.

It looks like everything came with the engine except the brain for the FI
that is attached to engine.

What else might I need.
I am thinking a new fuel pump.
I already have a late model tank so have the in and out tubes.
What else????
Where have other people mounted the brain?

Thanks in advance,
Snoopy
