First off, there is not much chance of it being &quot;out of track&quot;
unfortunetly..  Especially if one side moves when you turn the crank.

The bad side either has a bad cable (they are like a long, flexible worm
gear..they strip teeth off if undo stressis applied), or is stuck, or the
crank gear is stripped.

If the one side moves, though, the chances of a bad cable have just gone
up a good bit.  turning the crank should .always. move both sides of the
mechanism in a unit where everything is kosher.

the cable could also be broken at its end, where it attaches to the lift
mechanism (lowers and raises the rear of the panel).  If the cable is
broke here, it is .not. repairable, though many people have tried various
ways to do it.    Casting the two pieces together with aluminum might
work...but is most certialy not cheap.;)

These cables are beginning to show up more frequently in parts
catalogs...for a long time they were nearly NLA.   

Should the cable be stripped, or broken, replacement is the only realistic
option.

&gt; is ok). It won't budge either way.  I've taped up the seams on the
&gt; roof to keep water out (I live near Seattle).

Oh no.  Ducttape is a sunroof guy's nightmare.;) Say it aint so...

&gt; Any ideas on how to get the sunroof out so I can rebuild it?  

Whether the cable is broken, the gear or cable stripped, or if its just
plain jammed...first, look up along the sides to be sure there is nothing
in there visible jamming the unit.  Use flashlights!:)

Then, and this might be tough with a roof this big, so a helper may be
called for...

Turn the crank .slowly. and carefully to move the unit forward.  AT THE
SAME TIME pull the panel towards the front of the bus on the bad side.
unless it is jammed (or misaligned...make sure both sides are in the same
position.  a cockeyed sunroof is just like a cockeyed window..a bitch to
close..so straighten it out. even if it means running the good side
backwards first.)

Unless it is jammed, the broken side will slide forward as you crank the
crank. (albeit perhaps not easily..)  On that side, at least, there is
noting more you can really break, so pull.  

slide it almost fully closed. (and at this point i must refer to my
bentley for model specifics, since i cant see the unit)

Now, carefully pry between the panel and the interior cover along the
front edge..there are 5 pushclips you need to seperate before you close
the unit.  once those are all down, slide the interior panel back into the
roof as far as it'll go...or the edge of the pan, whichever comes first.;)

lol. i find this amusing..when it tells you to open the unit to being with
it says to &quot;open it slightly&quot; with a subnote that 5-6 inches is adequate!
Lol. thats like almost half the way open for what i'm used to working
on....

so, ok. you closed it most of the way, and popped the inner panel down,
and slid it back.

now, close the roof up to about the 2 inch from closed point.

Assuming the Haynes is accurate, you can go from there.

Basically, you unscrew the 4 screws from the front, and slide the front
guides out. (or just out of the way.)

now on the rear there are two little leaf springs, one on each side...they
just flip out of the way.

now, i'd have to see it to underand this part...been a while since i was
in any roof, and even longer since it was a VW....&quot;pull the left and right
lifters -located at the rear of the cables- out of the brackets on the
roof, then turn the lifters down.

Carefully lift and slide the panel out, the rear guides will have to come
out of the notches in the track.


While you're replacing things, check out that seal.  if its torn (or
missing!) go ahead and replace it if you can find areplacement.


good luck.
