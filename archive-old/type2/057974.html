I'll try and keep this simple. I want to timing my type 4 motor. Its a 411
1971 FI converted to carb motor (engine code W) in my bus. Because I'm using
an 009 distributor,  I'm looking to time my motor at 28 degrees BTDC. So the
instruction sheet has you check your pulley for notches. I have one on the
inside of the pulley. 

So I flip off the valve cover and turn my rotor to TDC for number, where the #
3 valves hit the nice spot.  My rotor looks good but my pulley notch appears
to be a good inch to the left of 12 oclock on the pulley, ie the crack in the
fan housing. (lets say around 10 degrees after TDC)  So, I look at it, assume
0 degrees is the 12 oclock crack in the case - and then 28 BTDC must be off to
the right of that somewhere. I guesstimate where I think it might be (any way
to be exact?) and mark it, hook up my strobe light and start the motor. 

Now with the strobe light knob set to 0 degrees, my pulley notch rides around
the same place it was before, and my guesstimated 28 btdc mark is still
hanging out off to the right of 12 oclock. When I turn my advance knob on the
strobe light to 28 degrees, my guesstimated 28 degree mark on the pulley
promptly moves over to the left until it lines up with the crack on fan
housing (12 oclock on the pulley).  

So, is that it? Am I paranoid because I'm not confident about the zero degree
reference mark being the case crack on the fan housing (12 o'clock)?    any
clearing of the air would be appreciated. 

thanks 

chris
