Hi fellow listees.


Well we made it back to Texas with the single cab Sunday  the three of us
slept in shifts so we could drive strait trough but on the way back we had a
breakdown on the tow vehicle had to take the single cab off the trailer and
drive it 26 miles to the nerest parts store twice 4 hours later we were back
on the road but other than that we had a great trip Tyler really cool and
his new bus is really cool and in emasculate shape well let you go will try
to get pics up soon
