Subject: Re: [T2] fuel injector cleaning

Working on trying to get a 77 transporter under a tree next month, replacing 
some sheet metal. running OK, all electrical working now except for 
turnsignals, I'll get back to that after bodywork.  Going to start the 
surgury on the right rear corner replacement (roof to butt cheek or whatever 
you want to call it) tomorrow afternoon.  Instead of spending entire  day at 
the shop, grabbed some homework, old injectors, injector resistor, battery, 
fuel pump, wire and took it back to the house.  Wired up the injectors and 
pump and shot gas tank treatment thru three of the four.  Reversed the fuel 
line to go into the buisness end of the injectors, turned them back around, 
got a better spray pattern the second time.  Next time I'll use straight 
fuel injector treatment, would have today but we were out.  I'm going to 
make a test bench with switches and a mount for the injector and pump.  I'll 
switch both, on/off for the fuel pump, momentary for the injector.  I'm 
thinking about setting up a double relay station on the same test bench.  
Felt like sharing, comments welcome.
