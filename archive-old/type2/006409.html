&gt;Thanks for the info! Man, I wish I lived near you. I would LOVE to work
with
&gt;VW parts all day. 
    
Be careful what you wish for!  ;-)

You see, I DO live near Ron and the Bus Depot and I've seen first hand what
a zoo the parts business can be.  Sure I've had one or two minor mixups or
delays on an order; that's life, I've had far worse with other suppliers and
dealerships.  I continue to support him because he busts his butt to get the
best quality for the least money.  

The first time I met Ron was about 2 years ago at his house to get a silly
$5 seal.  His place was wall to wall parts at the time.  Nowadays at the
retail store it's still wall to wall parts, but with the addition of phones
that never stop ringing and activity that never seems to stop.  Even with
the increased pace he and everyone there are always kind and helpful (even
if sometimes frazzled!).  
It's his personal commitment to the VW community that seems to make the
difference...ie: I've never been to a FLAPS where the owner went out parts
diving with me on a wrecked Vanagon or slipped a bottle of pumpkin ale into
the order!

Sure, mistakes happen, but it's nice to deal with someone who is upfront
about it and tries to correct it.  Kudos to everyone at the Bus Depot.

I'll get off the soapbox now (no affiliation, etc., etc)
