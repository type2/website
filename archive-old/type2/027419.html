Ain't it the truth. We bought a real cheap camper 3-4 years ago, had then 
and still has a flickering lite, after we've put 60K+ on it!!

Is there a chance that the old wiring, when heated, has more resistance and 
lite then comes on? (Wishful thinking maybe:). Guess I could throw a gauge 
on it and see what it really reads. Meanwhile, I've had a spare engine ready 
to put in it when required..gathering dust..as the ol' girl still sounds 
pretty fit.
