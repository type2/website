Yes, maybe because we are women, we just THINK  we are being patronized. After
all, I am sure he tells all the men who request gauges the same thing. How
overly sensitive of us. Gosh, thanks for the pat on the head! I mean, it's not
like we KNOW what we want, after all. Bye the way, I have oil temp gauge,
cylinder head gauge, and tachometer installed in my 72 bus, at the suggestion
of my mechanic. He knows his stuff. Carmen
