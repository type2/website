Subject: Mon. eve. project

Take a parti-colored Astroturf remnant, one hot-glue gun, and a front
floormat, and whaddaya get? My latest modification:
http://home.earthlink_dot_net/~shrike3/vwpage.html. I'm so glad I have a
roommate who tolerates car parts in the living room at odd hours. Thanks
to Craig K. for the hot glue idea, though me and the glue gun aren't
exactly the best of friends yet (you might say we didn't &quot;bond,&quot; huh-huh).

Dumb question: Suddenly I notice some of the posts have [VB] in the
subject line. What's that mean? Cross-post from vintagebus or something?

Saw a tan-on-brown '79 Adventurewagen in the yard at my mechanics'. He
let me peek inside and gave me permission to come back with a camera.
I'll post pics -- this is from when they scaled back production and
upgraded the materials they used -- looks like a boat interior. Really
nice, and pretty original. One of the mechanics was quite amused by my
Target flannel bus shorts (thanks for the tip, Ken!).

Nikki
