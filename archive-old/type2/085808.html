Subject: Re: [T2] How much material for Westy curtains?


I just bought some for the same project... I can't for the life of me 
remember the exact total and I don't have receipts, but here are some of the 
numbers I had:

Each side window was 36 inches wide by 18 tall, and that was with a certain 
margin for bunching. Depending on how much overlap you want on the sides of 
the windwos, you might make them up to 40x20 inches, each.

That I recall for sure. Here's where my memory gets foggy, and you might 
want to take a tape measure to confirm these numbers. The front curtain (my 
72 westy has snaps all around, so you can make one curtain for both doors 
and the windshield) would be about 25+50+25x35 inches. The extra length 
vertically is for the larger size of the windshield. It'll sit on the dash 
and bunch up there, but better that than hang too high and let in light. The 
rear window is a bit longer than the side windows (I think?) and you can go 
with something like 50x20 inches for that, or 25x20 times two, fastening at 
both sides instead of one curtain on one side.

One thing to keep in mind is that a lot of fabric is too thin to use as a 
curtain (lets light through), and you need to double or even triple it for 
it to be effective.

All of the numbers I've given you are on the large side, so if you add them 
all up and buy that much you'll probably have some scraps left over which 
you can keep for patches later on, or maybe even enough to make some 
matching pillows. You'll definitely have enough to get the job done.

&gt;
&gt;Hi Folks,
&gt;
&gt;Norman, our 72 Westy is in storage for about another two weeks..Still
&gt;waiting for the last of the snow to go up here in Ottawa, Ontario.  In
&gt;the meantime, I thought I would treat him to some new curtains.  Anybody
&gt;know how much material I would need to cover all windows using the old
&gt;cutains as a template?
&gt;
&gt;Much appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;Craig
