&gt; There are 
&gt; the unique 2 and 3 tang specials for others, like some of the WasserBoxers. 
&gt; 
&gt; Bosch makes also a 4 ground platinum sold after market only, and as far as 
&gt; I know they are like the original platinums, no manufacturer approves them 

Well, I run the quad plaits in my modified WBX engine, I changed to the 
triple copper to test them and LOST 2 MPG. Put the quads back in and mileage 
increased. 

I also run single platinum plugs them in my modified T4 engine and it runs 
much better and stronger with them.
