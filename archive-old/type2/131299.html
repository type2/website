Subject: RE: [T2] Re:air cooled swap meet...

Finally! A question *I* can answer!

It's called e-mail address spoofing. Spammers farm addresses not only to 
send you stuff, but to use in the From field too.

Anyone can do it easily. It can even be done in Outlook Express as long as 
your email server will pass it.

Not much you can do about it, but it generally doesn't last long. It's 
happened to my addresses twice. Both times only lasted a week or so.
