Subject: New Case

Howdy List,
	I live in the Boston area &amp; have a 1970 Camper turned Bus.  I've
taken the Transmission and Motor out to do winter maintenance.  I've decided
to spend the big money and invest in a new--not reconditioned--case, 1600?
Presently I'm talking with RMMW ($395) and GEX ($450).  Does anyone have any
feed back on buying  new 1600 cases from either the previous mentioned
vendors or some other source?  I've been told new is the way to go vice
reconditioned.
		Thank you for your time,        Dan
