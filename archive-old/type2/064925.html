Subject: Some thoughts on book values

Hello all,
        I don't mean to rock the boat or anything drastic but I've been
thinking about book values and what they mean.  Of course anything is only
worth what someone will pay for it, but it still is comforting, once in a
while, to know that your not wasting your hard-earned money in a &quot;money
pit&quot;.  Once someone realizes that something they're trying to sell is
&quot;collectible&quot; in the eyes of some authority, then the price will go up
drastically.  I'm pretty comfortable in saying that most people realize
that split window busses are becoming relatively scarce and that
collectors are buying them up.  Thus it will be hard to find a daily
driver for a dirt cheap price.  But as for bay windows and later busses
(please take no offense because I have a '73 myself) there are people who
consider them as &quot;just another old car of which there are plenty around&quot;
and will price accordingly.  If the masses don't consider them as special,
then they won't be worth as much.  Basically, what I'm trying to say is
that I can't see spending lots of money on a bay window because there are
so many around which aren't appreciated in the same way that splitties
are.   I got my '73 from some college surfer dude for $400.  It was
running well and had no rust.  Try that with a splittie.  On the other
hand, my '66 Westfalia was also $400.  It is rusty, has no brakes, doesn't
run, and had been sitting for over 13 years.  Eventually, I'm sure that
bay windows will follow the path of the splitties and then the vanagons
soon after.  But right now, I'm sure you can still get great deals on
these for a little while if you are patient and wait for the unappreciated
bus to show up (and it will).  It can also happen with splitties but
you've got to be REALLY patient and lucky.
