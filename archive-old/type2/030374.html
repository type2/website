Rotating seats were a westy-only thing.  

Here's what I *know* (I have or have owned one) and think (I have seen one
and am trying desperately to remember (always a mistake on the list :-)):

'68-73

I know that my '73 does not have a rotating seat (either seat) and that
with the metal backer between the seats and cabinets, it would be pretty
pointless.  I don't think any '68-73 did.  In addition, while the driver's
seat uses the standard sliding rails, the passenger seat clips in, so
later seats cannot be used without major mods.

'74-75

I do not believe that the '74/5 Westy settup would have had rotating seats
as it had the stove cabinet mounted behind the passenger and the sink
mounted behind the driver, but have not owned one.  They might.

'76-79

I know that my '76 had a rotating passenger seat and a fixed driver's
seat.  I believe this is how it was from the introduction of the last
westy settup in '76 thru '79.  transplanting the rotating seat to a
non-westy would be a PITA and would involve welding.  the base of the
rotating seat is welded to the seat bedestal/wheel arch and would need to
be cut from a donor.

As a further data point, my new V'gon (80) has both seats on rotating
bases, with the same welded in mounts.
