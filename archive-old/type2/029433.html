Subject: Locking engine latch

Volks,

I got one of the locking engine compartment latches that Karl mentioned
the other day and it is *nice*!  It took me a couple minutes to figure out
what I was doing wrong in installation, so I took some pics and made up a
basic page. If you are considering this go to:

As always, I welcome corrections/comments.
