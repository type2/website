&gt;Here's the preface to the question.   On the very front of the left hand
&gt;carb... along the line that the Electromagnetic Cutoff valve is screwed

&gt;right &lt;FIF&gt; appears to be factory sealed, the other, on the left, looks like
&gt;it might have lost its seal.  Follow??  This means that I can actually see
&gt;the rod of the aforementioned valve. When I connect the valve to a battery
&gt;and then to the Electro cutoff valve... I can see the rod move!
&gt;
&gt;Is this carb kacked?  Will it work if installed on the motor or will that
&gt;hole screw it up??

That hole will screw it up.  A few weeks ago my bus started to run horrible
- would only go under full throttle and would not idle.  Upon examination I
found that the very plug you speak of had popped out.  Fortunately I found
it lying on the engine tin.  I pressed it back in and put some epoxy over
it to hold it.  I've seen several other carbs done up exactly the same way
in exactly the same place.  So, it's not a serious problem, but you need to
fix it before you try to drive your bus.  Block the hole any way you can -
best would be to tap it and put in a threaded plug, but it might not be
thick enough for that, I'm not sure.  As a temporary fix, you can use a
piece of duct tape - just make sure it's a big piece (so it won't get
sucked in) and don't leave it there very long.
