&gt; Hi,
&gt; My wife tried her first tune up and now the bus wont start.  I think the
&gt; wires are in the wrong order on the distributor.  On a '78 type IV
&gt; engine, the four distributor post are driver front, passenger front,
&gt; driver rear, passenger rear.  four plugs, driver front, passenger front,
&gt; driver rear passenger rear.  Which plug goes to which post?  

Did your wife take the plug wires off?  If she didn't then this isn't the
problem.

Pop off the two spring clips and remove the distributor cap.  On the upper
edge of the aluminum distributor body you'll find a line scribed into the
aluminum.  The wire that is directly over this line when the distributor
cap is installed goes to cylinder #1 (right front).

Looking down upon the cap and going clockwise, the remaining wires should
go to Cylinder #4 (left rear), Cylinder #3 (left front), and Cylinder #2
(right rear).
