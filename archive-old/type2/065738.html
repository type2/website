&gt; It's a late breadloaf type bus, a panel van, white with FedEx logo
&gt; on sides and back.  Delivery man is standing behind it, one foot
&gt; propped on the bumper, filling out a package slip.  Hazards are on.
&gt; I thought this was really cool when I saw it.  It must be a pretty
&gt; recent photo as the logo on the side is the newer &quot;FedEx&quot; rather
&gt; than the old Federal Express.  I'm thinking this must be in Mexico
&gt; or Brazil somewhere.  The license plate on it was the same shape as
&gt; ours here in the states.  Any ideas?

This is the 'de facto' deliver vehicle in Mexico...seen lotsa FedEx
buses when I was in Mexico City, Pueblo, etc.  Can you see the front
of the Bus?  There should be a radiator there.  Also does the roof
appear higher and more square?  The Buses still being manufactured in
Mexico and Brazil have a fibreglass [maybe plastic] roof that looks
more the shape of the vanagon and waterboxer westies than the rounded
shape of the splits and breadloafs we love.

Finally, can you make out anything on the plate?  All the plates in
Mexico have the state name across the bottom, but are otherwise very
plain [no logos or slogans].

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Splits...Oh, my!
