Subject: Casebolt bushings?

Volks,

I won't go into why, but i split the 73 1700 case i will be rebuilding into an
1800.

A couple of the little plastic 'spacers' or 'bushings' that are on the big
case bolts around the cylinder bores were brittle and crumbled when i removed
them.

Anybody know what these little daddies are officially called and who might
have em?

Secondarily, anybody got a good solid lift T4 cam they wanna sell?  Busdepot
can do me up for about $80 - $90, but i wanna see if somebody might have one
laying around they wanna move.

And finally or 'tertiarily', should i find a windage tray to put in this
thing?  I read the archives and noone seems to be too concerned about it. 
Wilson says it stops the wind (hence the moniker) off the crank from oil
starving the sump and the cam.  Archived messages speak of preventing
'sloshing' during cornering, but wilson says nothing about this.  One man's
opinion i guess.  Thoughts?

Thanks,

Clark Gordon
