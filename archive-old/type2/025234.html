Kate,

If you have a USA '71, you have engine assisted brakes.   There are holes on
the manifold below the carb, one is typically pointing directly to the left
(drivers side) and is the size of fuel line.  Another is typically pointing
toward the driver and is angled up.. it is much larger size hole and is only
on 1971 Type 2's (and later bugs, but only 1 year on the Type 2 in the USA).

I heard you mention the dual port manifold boots, the boots that join the
three sections.  You did replace those, right?  What did you replace them
with (split boots)?  These are not easy to replace, but they are often the
source of WORST leaks.

http://www.i405_dot_com/vw/stand/  &lt;== some general engine photos, but I don't
have any good ones of the manifold.

Also consider the gasket under the carb.  Are the bolts tight (not too
tight!).  Might be time to borrow a working carb from another listee and see
if a simple carb swap and new gasket eliminates part of the problem.

On the plug wires -- I'm sure you are sick of plug wires by now -- but IMO -
the EMPI wires I have purchased for several engines are better than the
Bosch.  They use the threaded &quot;widget&quot; that the spark plugs come with and
secure much better to the plug.  There is a positive engagement when you put
these on.  They are also 7mm and high-quality silicone wire.  Available in
resistor or non resistor.  About $10 too...  Come in several kewl colors :)

On oil temp -- that &quot;125-158&quot; figure you mention seems to match what I have
seen printed as VW stickers on the fan housing.  Is this where you got this?
That is &quot;normal&quot; warm temp for doing idle, that isn't the normal oil temp at
highway speed.  I say anything below 230 is OK.  Your engine is running hot,
very hot.  This is sign of an air leak... or fuel starvation, or a more
serious (damage) problem.

On the fuel pump, use the photos at http://www.i405_dot_com/vw/stand/ and tell
us what type you have.

Uh... I don't even know where that is. I don't have power brakes or
anything, as far as I know.
