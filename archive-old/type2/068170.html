Re: Installing an oil cooler with a fan inside a bus:

My mechanic has been doing that for years for his trips
into Alaska (from Laguna Beach,CA).
He leaves some of the fittings in place and just seals
them off for the rest of the time.
He just came back from a trip recently and spent a long
time expounding on its effectiveness and how he drove 
thru Alaska with zero degrees outside, and his windows open 
with him in a tee shirt!

Cool!
