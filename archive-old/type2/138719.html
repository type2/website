Subject: Re: [T2] Hard Starting -- Update

Hi Folks,

I tried starting fluid and nothing's different.  I sprayed it in the air 
intake horn, and the engine was just as hard to start.  Next time, I pulled 
off the oil rebreather hose and sprayed the fluid directly into the S-hose 
-- again, no change.

Based on Dave's theory
&gt;If you use it and the engine starts &quot;more instantly&quot;....then the
&gt;starter/battery is probably not the cause....something on the fuel side is
&gt;probably not working well.
I'm thinking the problem may be spark-related or electrical.  However, I'll 
try preloading the fuel ring by moving the AFM flap, just to make sure.

BTW, This morning, when I first got it started, it was idling REALLY rough 
(35F air temp), and I revved it up to 3000 once.  After that, it idled 
smoothly.  Also, my ALT light stays on when idling at startup, but goes out 
with a throttle blip above 1200.  Don;t know if it's related, but I figured 
I'd mention it.

This should make for an interesting Saturday.  I'll keep y'all posted....
