Subject: weber carb help

Help,

I have a pair of Weber 34-ICT carbs for my 1800.  I am looking for more
information on these carbs so that I can reinstall them.  (I have
recently rebuilt my engine, and the carbs have been off for over 6
months.)

Specifically, there are a pair of springs which have me mystified.  I
have no idea where they go, though I am sure that they belong on the
carbs.  They have no hooks on the end, so I am assuming that they go
inside of something. They are about 3/4 to 1 inch long and 1/4 inch in
diamteter.

I did not rebuild the carbs, so I am sure that the springs had to be
removed in order to remove carbs from the engine.

Any suggestions?
