Subject: Re: [T2] Switching from 4speed to Auto - what parts needed ?

check the archives this has been gone over with several times.
. frames are slightly different
. different accel linkages
. different mounts (tranny front)
. floor at shifter different
. different shift linkage mounts
. accelerator is on different side of engine. (sort of)

also the 73 auto tranny is a vacuum shift and needs lines to manifold, try
to get late model tranny (75-79) it has a vacuum shift and parts are still
mostly avaliable.

&gt; my friend wants to change his 73 bus from the dead 4 speed to an 
&gt; Automatic......
&gt; 
&gt; there is a 73 crunched automatic at the junkyard....
&gt; 
&gt; what parts will he need?
&gt;  I know tranny and axles/CVs, 
&gt; plus torque converter / flexplate (actually he is going to switch out the 
&gt; complete engine/trans from the Auto bus
&gt; shifter and bigger brake pedal
&gt; 
&gt; anything else that you would not normally think about ?
