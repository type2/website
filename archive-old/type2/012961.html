I'll be there in Speedy, but she can't enter the show, 'cause she's under-age.
 The show is pretty large, from what previous attendees have told me.
 The facility is great, too.  I'm holding off on buying some odds 'n'
ends til the show and pick them up there.

Anyone want to meet up there at a booth or something?

&gt; Larry, 
&gt; 
&gt; I don't plan on entering my bus, but I'd love to meet up with some

&gt; the folks from the list. Anyone interested?
