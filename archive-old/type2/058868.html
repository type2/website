Subject: 75 heat exchangers for sale
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

While cleaning out the garage sun. I found a brand new set of heat
exchangers that I had bought Ron _at_ The Bus Depot.They fit a 1800 Type IV.
VWOA was nice enough to give me a new set under the LeCoz program so I
stashed these. Well, my new bus is going to be a '71, which I am going to
Az. to pick up.(More on that after I make travel arrangements). So, if
anyone needs these, the price is $250.00 (big loss -:() plus shipping.
Please p-mail me if interested. TBear
