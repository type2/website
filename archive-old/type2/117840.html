Subject: Re: [T2] POR 15 (fwd)

Grrr....snipped a lot of the original, but the mail program at type 2
zapped it to the list again...here it is with more snipped out...


Terry,

Ok!

I guess that both are *supposed* to do what I want done on my parts(not 
necessarily body parts).

I am not permanently hooked on por-15, so will drop by the local auto-body
store at lunch tomorrow and check this stuff out.

I remember you talking about the frame rails before and was 
impressed...just didn't remember when I needed to!

I see on the net that it is available in an aerosol also!

Terry, I heard about it by asking a fellow vw'er about what to paint
my new pans with....he pointed out a guy with a baja who had used it on 
the insides of his fenders 5 years ago....they still looked new and did
*not* have any rock chips...so I tried it...

Cheers, dave

&gt; Dave,

&lt;snipped for brevity&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; What I use for frame rails on Semi's--and oh boy do they get beat
&gt; up--especially in excavating units --is SEM--Rust Shield.
&gt; 
&gt; nozzle ), and I'll tell ya what--I have 12 Macks in the dirt or in the
&gt; stone everyday--parked outside 24 /7/ 365--and I painted the frames
&gt; black with the SEM--8 years ago-----and the stuff is still shining !!--
&gt; IT hasen't worn off the half fenders where the rubber flaps on the dump
&gt; trailer's lay on them--I am amazed--
&gt; 
&gt; OK--you have my answer Dave--
&gt; So now it's my turn---
&gt; 
&gt; Why is it--that any prominent body repair / paint shop anywhere, not
&gt; only doesn't use any POR products--but never even heard of the stuff??
&gt; 
&gt; I never heard of it either--until I got involved with the VW's--
&gt; And I am truly amazed--
&gt; 
&gt; There is no miracle in a can---:&gt;)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; See ya-- 
&gt; 
&gt; Terry
