Subject: Re: Fuel injection?

Greetings,
  Here is a copy of some questions I had about installinng a late model
Vanagon fuel injection set-up on a 74 bus with a carbed 1800.  Currently
using a progressive Weber and a 009 which I really dont like.
If anyone  has any info and would be willing to review this and reply I
would really appreciate it.
Thanks,
Ed Maikranz

&gt; I believe that there is more to it and I may need to be correected.
&gt; You'll need an electric fuel pump with the mounting brackets ( got 
&gt; one for $40.00) and add the wire to actuate it , its in the wire 
&gt; loom setup that comes with the injector setup.
&gt; The Air Flow Meter is a good sized box and it will require mounting 
&gt; brackets and I'm not sure that you have room. However I have the air 
&gt; cleaner boxes from an 80-83 and an 87 so I think we can accomidate a 
&gt; air box that will work.
&gt; I'll need to know which distributor you have, it needs to be avaccum 
&gt; advance with at least 38 degrees at full advance at 3200 RPM.
&gt; Again I must say, I'm not absolutely sure that the conversion can be 
&gt; made. My 83 Air Cooled has a return fuel tank, a charcoal canister 
&gt; for fuel vapor recovery and a crankcase ventilator tube. Unless your 
&gt; van was previously injected I think you're wasting you time.
&gt; That is about it!
&gt; I'd like to sell this systyem but I want to be straight with you 
&gt; about the potential installation headaches.
&gt; Take a look at the engine picture at this site and see what you 
&gt; think http://blackhead_dot_netfirms_dot_com/81engine.jpg
&gt; 
&gt; Feel free to post my entire reply to the Vanagon List or Type2 List 
&gt; for getting more information.

&gt; &gt; Stan,
&gt; &gt;  	I was looking at the stuffyou hve for sale and had a 
&gt; &gt; question.  The fuel injection set-up you have, could it be used on 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; an 1800cc engine in a 74 bus?  Besides the gas tank what else 
&gt; would 
&gt; &gt; I need? Any changes to the ignition?   Would it be worth it?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks,
