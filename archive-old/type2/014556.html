Subject: [T2] Shift lineage problem part 2..(was I'm back and i have a problem)
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL
 a problem)

Jamie,

I went out today and checked it out as it's the first day warm enough not to 
die of exposure (OK so I'm exaggerating) 

Anyway, I got it out of gear. It will only go into third and fourth. Now this 
is the bad part, the shifter itself is broken (I imagine in the floor) it 
will turn to the right counterclockwise from position six on the clock. (Does 
that make any sense?)

I am hoping it is the just the shifter linkage and not a tranny problem. I am 
a complete idiot when it comes to transmissions. 

Thanks!
Melissa

&gt;Point is, while he was &quot;moving &quot; it he got it stuck in gear.

&gt;Melissa



Can you explain a little better?
What gear is it stuck in?
   I take it you can still drive it around in 1st gear only?
..then I'd guess that the linkage is discomboobriated... and should be an
easy fix, if you crawl underneath and look at the front of the trans you
might find the broken part?

If it is stuck BETWEEN gears and you can not move the shifter ,, and cannot
drive it then,, you will LIKLEY have to take the nose cone off the trans and
repair / replace the offeending parts.

See if you can tell me more information facts about the problem ok?
