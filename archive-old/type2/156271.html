Subject: Re: [T2] Oregon Insurance

&gt; eSurance was pretty cheap.
&gt;
&gt; When checking for quotes online, pick a 1980 Vanagon. The rate is the same
&gt; according to both eSurance and Progressive. Just make sure you call to
&gt; actually purchase the policy so the right car is added.

doesnt esurance just send you to a local broker?
i think esurance had a progressive agent call us.
