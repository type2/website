Subject: stripped spark plug hole

Hey Aaron,

Sorry to hear about your problems.  I have had a similar experience. 
My #4 cylinder blew the spark plug out, stripping all the threads.  I 
found that someone earlier had already had problems and put a 
Helicoil kit in it, which had stripped out as well.I dropped the 
engine and pulled the tin off and used an epoxy cylinder head repair 
kit, then put in a new heli coil (I used another, better, brand, but 
can't remember the name of it).  I was skeptical of the epoxy kit, 
but it never failed for 4 years until I did a complete rebuild. 
While I had the engine out I replaced all the tubing and seals and 
repainted all the tin.  I think you can do it without pulling the 
engine though.  Pull off the cylinder head tin (there are a lot of 
screws to find).  You can then retap the hole and put a new Helicoil 
in place.  There is the danger of dropping metal shavings into the 
cylinder.  My mechanic suggested this procedure and it worked very 
well:  Turn the engine until that piston is at the bottom of its 
stroke.  Take a grease gun and a couple tubes of grease and fill the 
cylinder completely.  When you are done cutting the new threads, 
place rags in the engine bay where you think the grease will go, and 
turn the motor by hand.  Most of the grease will shoot out the spark 
plug hole and land on your rags, carrying the metal shavings with it. 
You will have a lot of blue smoke from the remainder of the grease, 
but it will burn out pretty quickly.

Hope this helps.
