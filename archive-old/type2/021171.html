Subject: ??Wiring VDO oil pressure gauge
References: &lt;002301c0e008$d07d32c0$31bc1fce_at_heurikon_dot_com&gt; &lt;3B0727BE.DC218CB4_at_snet_dot_net&gt;

Finally got around to fixing minor stuff on the Westy, including
installing an oil pressure gauge.
After spending an hour grinding the fan housing opening larger to fit
the VDO oil pressure sender, I got it screwed in.  Can't find the
directions- likely got thrown out- there are 2 terminals on the sender,
I think one is ground.  But on the gauge there are 3 terminals under the
light connectors- a (+), a center unmarked, and a right marked (S).  So
how do I hook in the 2 sender wires?   I'm sure some listees have done
this.
