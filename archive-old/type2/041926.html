&gt; What are you really paying for when you add the 100 extra bux (compared to
the
&gt; CB Performance meter, which has a heated element and goes from 12 to 17
&gt; :1(analog gauge&gt;

One question for the list; does ANYONE here have/use a CB meter that they
are happy with?

I know what I've seen from their unit, and that's what spurred me into
creating ours!
