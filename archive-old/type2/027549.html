&gt;Hi folks,
&gt;
&gt;Well, it's starting to get cold here and although I don't plan on driving 
&gt;my camper much in the winter months, I would like to take it
&gt;once in a while.  So I have a stock 1600 dp with NOS heat exhangers from
&gt;The Bus Depot,  since I've never really driven my camper yet I was
&gt;wondering how well they work when temps get down into the teens.  My
&gt;camper(70 Westy) isn't perfect in the door seal area but I plan on fix-
&gt;ing that soon.  Should I bring a sweater for city driving and long
&gt;sleeve shirt for the highway?  All the ducting under the bus is in great
&gt;shape and I have the belly pan.
&gt;
&gt;Just curious.
&gt;

my 71 has an intact heating system with new heater boxes and i estimate it 
will heat the interior of the bus about 30 degress warmer than the outside 
ambient air temps....so, if it is 0 degrees F outside it will be 30 F 
inside...i am going to a thinner oil tommorrow to try and get the inside 
temp to a cozy 32....i live in the ozarks, where it gets about 0 for the 
low....i recommend you collect sweaters, wool socks, muckluks, etc....still 
wouldn't drive anything else, though..i cringe at the thought of driving a 
&quot;modern minivan&quot;.....
