Subject: Re: [T2] Engine removal question.

Are we talking 1600 here or 17/18/2000?  Can't help you on the doghouse but
have had the pancake out twice in as many weeks.  Pull em together, way
easier!  Done it each time by myself with no problems.  Only need a floor
jack and some wooden blocks.

YMMV,
Bill

Subject: [T2] Engine removal question.


&gt;
&gt;
&gt; So here I sit.. dirty, tired and greasy, with my engine half out of my
bus.
&gt; I'm stuck, I'm cursing at myself loudly, and I think I might have called
the
&gt; engine a few names. Amazingly I went without the traditional engine
removal
&gt; beer tool, and maybe the powers that be are laughing at me for my folly
:-)
&gt;
&gt; I managed to pull the engine as far as I can to the rear apron. and now
&gt; looking between the engine and trans I see (a mile I guessed in anger) the
&gt; input shaft seemingly has gotten longer... or its coming out of the trans.
&gt; (Please god no I'll be good I promise)
&gt;
&gt; Has anyone had a similar experience.. I removed the coil to allow a couple
of
&gt; more inches, but I dont see the input shaft splines.. I think I broke
&gt; something and now that the andrenaline has died down I think I might just
&gt; cry.
&gt;
&gt; If it turns out serious enough, is there someone close to Modesto, CA with
&gt; some similar experiences that can maybe point at the situation and say do
&gt; this?
&gt;
&gt; If not I just need some advice and beer money.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt;
&gt; Tyler
