Subject: Izusu deisel

A freind of mine has a running (or at leat it was) motor out of a Pup truck,
that he would just give me.  I have looked a little into the motor, and it
seems like it would be a good candidate for a VW swap.  The question I have is
this-
this deisel came in the Chevette, Chevy Luv, Izusu Impulse and Izusu Pup, I
don't know what else it might have been put in.
Kennedy has adaptors for the Chevy II and Chevy Citation.  I wonder if they
used the same trans and/or share the same bolt pattern.JT Beaufort, SC
