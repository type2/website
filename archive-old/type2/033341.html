Volks,

  Also, when I hooked everything up after tune up I had a backfire and had 
crossed wires. I then changed wires to correct cylinders. This am I got to 
thinking maybe and I dont know if possible I blew a sparkplug gap closed, so 
I pulled the plugs to check and found no inappropriate gaps. I did find #s 1 
&amp;2 were real white/lean and 3 &amp; 4 were brown. I always monitored plug 3 to 
check for lean or rich mixture and always saw a good brown /tan. I thought 
all would be the same.

 Thanks,
  David
    Mr ST
