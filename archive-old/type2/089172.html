Subject: Guage Calibration


&gt; Happy Weekend, List.
&gt;
&gt; I have a new VDO oil pressure guage that seems to read low. The reason I
&gt; think this is because the needle sits beow zero when the power is on, but
&gt; before the engine is running. Engine off = 0 pressure, power on = guage
&gt; reading from sensor, should put the needle at 0, but it sits belowthe zero
&gt; hash mark. Is there any way that I can calibrate the needle to the zero
&gt; point?
&gt;
&gt; Suggestions, advice, and irrational opinions welcomed!
