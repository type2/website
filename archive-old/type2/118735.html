Subject: [T2] Bad hydraulic lifters (rant)


 &gt; After months of trouble, and bad compression, I finally bit the bullet
and pulled my one year old 1200 mile AVP engine and took off the heads.
&gt;
&gt; Guess what : the intake lifter on cylinder #3 was as solid as a rock. The
cylinder wall and head were black with soot.

Unless I'm missing something here, &quot;solid as a rock&quot; is what you want.
You're saying you tried to compress the lifter and it wouldn't compress?
That's a good lifter.

&gt; The other lifters had varying degrees of compressibility.

Depending on how long it sat while you got around to pulling the heads - if
you've only got 1,200 miles after a year, this engine sat a lot - then some
bleed down of the lifters is to be expected, with the result being some
degree of compressability.

&gt; Someone at a local VW shop had told me about bad hydraulic lifters in type
4 engines and this confirms it. I believe that Boston Bob had an article
about it too.
&gt;
&gt; I bought a replacement set of lifters from CB Performance (their so called
high speed ones) and hope that those will run better.
&gt;
&gt; The bad news is that Leonard at AVP refused to honor the warranty, citing
that the engine heat tabs had fallen off which, IMHO, is yet another chicken
and egg story : would that had happened if the hydraulic lifters were good?

If I remember correctly, AVP regrinds their lifters.  It seems like there's
only about a couple of things that could be &quot;wrong&quot; with reground lifters:

1) &quot;Inners&quot; not functioning properly due to dirt, missing parts, whatever.
I'd think this would result in lifters that would never pump up properly.
Were the lifters noisy, never quieting down even after the engine was
completely warmed up?

2) Not grinding the &quot;foot&quot; of the lifters to a proper convex shape, meaning
they wouldn't rotate properly, resulting in rapid wear to the foot of the
lifter and the cam lobes.  Are you seeing this?

I'm not sure how either problem would result in significant overheating.
