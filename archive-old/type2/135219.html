&gt;Not much in the archives about using red-top optima batteries for

I put one in a month or so ago from Sears during one of their battery sales. I bought in from Sears (Optima 34R is Sears #27933). Fits the battery clamp. I had to get a raincheck for the price because they didn't stock it normally. No Sears in the area had one.

The 34R has the reversed terminals (previously called the Orange top by Optima). If you have an earlier model with the ground strap by the taillights you can use the Optima 34. If you find a bargain price on an Orange top keep in mind it may have been built and sitting on the shelf a long time. The Sears Optima was brand new as indicated by the mfgr date stamped on it.

&gt; Or perhaps two, wired in 
&gt;parallel? Are the properly matched to a late bay alternator?

I've only got the one battery in the bus. The voltage seems to be much higher under load than a regular battery but is still compatible with the stock alternator and voltage regulator.

&gt;Are they worth the candle?

They are expensive compared to other batteries but I was tired of acid leaks and for me that was worth the extra expense.
