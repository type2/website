So I wrote:
I've been driving my beloved baby girl around in a carseat in the back of 
my '78 Westfalia for about 9 months now. There is nothing intrinsically 
unsafe about baby seats in a Westy (unless you are one of that smirking 
crowd that KNOWS that VW buses are deathtraps under any circumstances 
and what the heck are you doing driving one of those things anyway, but 
if you were, you wouldn't be on this list). All the general cautions 
about baby seats certainly apply though. 

Babies under 20# and 1 year old ride facing backwards. The seat needs to
be strapped in very tightly. And it needs to be level. The seat I use is
pretty flat on the bottom, so it cinches down just right.  It's easier to
get some seats level if you use a folded up towel as a wedge under the
seat. Our seat rides on the driver's side of the bench seat, so there is 
room for an adult next to the baby on the passenger side. 

I also run a strap from the back of the seat (which faces the front of 
the bus) forward to the round bracket for the table pole. Cinched 
tightly, this keeps the seat from lifting up along its leading edge.

My baby rides much more happily when I equip her with toys and sing to her
constantly. Judicious manipulation of curtains to keep sun out of the
baby's eyes also enhances customer satisfaction. With mom as a copilot,
one of us can quickly clamber into the back to hang with the baby as
needed until she falls asleep, then rejoin the driver in the front. It's
part of that wonderful &quot;living room in your backseat&quot; quality of a Westy. 

A poorly installed baby seat is more dangerous than none at all they say. 
And more than half of all baby seats are improperly installed, they say. 
So be contientious about getting everything tighttighttight and level, 
then relax about it.

Drive safely,
