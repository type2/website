Yes, I agree with you.  Haven't taken my bay down there yet but  I've spent a lot of time in Mexico also.  I've never felt danger  anywhere I've been.  I remember in 1995 I went on a little Yucatan  excursion and ended up driving by a VW dealership just south of  Cancun.  I swear I thought I had gone back in time.  Huge lot  full of bugs and busses...brand new!  Saw lots of them on the  roads too.  I can't wait to drive mine down there. Might not come  back.  Cheers...KR

&gt;I'm not sure if the highway goes through any  of the bad areas but there
&gt;are a lot of hijackings, kidnappings, and  even murders.  It is listed on
&gt;the CIA site as having many  dangerous areas.

If the CIA included US sites in its list we'd be scared of going to a lot
of places here!  People get killed and mugged everywhere.  Not even
Disneyland is perfectly safe!

I've spent quite a bit of time in Mexico, and it seems that most
USAians who got in trouble were behaving in ways that they never
would at home.  Walking out of a bar dead drunk after flashing a roll of
money is a perfect invitation to a mugging in either Bogota or Boise.  If
the mugging goes badly, you end up with a murder.  The only difference is
that if it happens in Bogota the headlines here read &quot;American Tourist
Slain in Columbia.&quot;

Now, for some VW content:  If you have an early bay, Mexico has to be one
of the best places to travel.  Less worries about parts and repairs than
travelling in the US!  Every little town has a repair shop with extensive
experience with aircooled vehicles.

Best travel book for Mexico:  &quot;The People's Guide to Mexico.&quot;  It's even
fun to read if you never intend to travel south of the border!

George
