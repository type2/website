Subject: Vacuum and oil level

Could my wildly and rapidly fluctuating manifold vacuum relate to my being 2 
quarts low in oil??

I replaced my oil cooler seals and only put in two quarts because I wanted 
to see if I had any leaks before topping off..

Well, dummy, if you don't put any oil IN, you ain't going to have any oil 
leak OUT!!!

But could that (low oil) be the reason my manifold vacuum  (1700 dual carbs 
) was rapidly bouncing on the vacuum scale??
