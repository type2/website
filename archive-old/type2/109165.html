Subject: Re: [T2] Oil temp sender/sump plate

Well, my case is also a GE and is the original according to the paper work
that I have from the first owner and place of purchase. I'll have to check
it out at the next oil change and keep the fingers crossed. Now I just need
to find that sump plate.

&gt; For some reason my GE case has the cutout. The last PO was in 1979 and the
case number matches the number that was recorded by the dealer at the time
of purchase. There's only one receipt for engine work and no mention of
milling that part of the case. It still looks like a sloppy cut the factory
wouldn't make. Go figure...
&gt;
&gt; WRT the temperature differential, I agree that the units tapped into the
Type 4 sump plate that lack the 914 air deflector read cooler than they
should. I think that's universally acknowledged. I've never read a complaint
from a 914 owner about reading the temp there.
