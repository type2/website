I made the switch this summer after I was having some problems.  Only been
four months and 3,000 miles but it has been good so far.  I bought the
conversion kit from JC Whitney.  It was around $100 (estimate) and I paid my
mechanic a few bucks to install it.

The way I looked at it was:  Why not update the vehicle to 1990 standards?
No reason to operate like it is still the 70s.

Best of luck to all of us with or without points.
