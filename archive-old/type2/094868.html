Subject: re: trip, water trouble! what should i do

my wife and i are on our 11th day living in our van traveling -- we are in 
pa right now -- no trouble with the van except on our 74 we are having water 
trouble!

at first it was no big deal, my water pump broke -- i was about 100 miles 
from bus depot so we drove there and picked up a new handi pump!! wow we got 
to go in the bus depot! -- that was a story...

i put the new pump in (after the guy at the bus depot said I would not need 
any type of gasket) the pumped worked great -- but I had a big fat leak at 
the drain tube (out of the bus) -- fixed that (i thought) then the pump at 
the water holding tank leaked -- then the tube that takes the water to the 
sink started leaking after thinking i had fixed all three -- now all three 
places are leaking again -- what the hell should i do ????????????

thanks for your help list -- youre the greatest

take it to an r.v. place or a plumber - i am sick of trying to fix it - i am 
not making any progress and my wife is less and less convinced that I am 
able to fix things myself...
