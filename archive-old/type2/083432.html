Subject: Re: [T2] what engine

The problem with putting big engines into buses is that these engines are
generally designed to put out increased power for short periods of time,
such as when accelerating.  If you use the big power to climb a long hill
in the summertime you will have problems unless the engine is _very_ well
built (as in $4000+).

&gt; We have a 1971 bus that needs a new engine, we want to buy a long block but
&gt; who is a good builder. Has anyone had any experience with putiing in a larger

&gt; ranging from 1641cc to 2110, now the 2110 is to much money but something
&gt; inbetween would do. any ideas thanks
