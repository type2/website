Subject: weber carb set up

Hello all,
     I've got a few questions about the weber progressive carb set up.  I've
stumbled upon a 76 bus complete without any fuel injection components.  I
know that fuel injected is the way to go but that will take time and money
to gather up all the parts.  I'd like to get this bus rolling under it's own
power soon.   What type of fuel pump are being used, the electric fuel pump
is also gone, can I use a universal electric fuel pump?  If anyone has info
on setting up one of these  units I really appreciated hearing about it,
also if anyone has a weber progressive setup that their selling let me know.
 Thanks, Mark
