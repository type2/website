Subject: 2 for 1 Special!

Hey Y'all,
Well, we had our first Truly Chilly morning in SW Ohio today, reminding that
the heater in my 71 bus is not warm enough to keep the kiddies warm on the way
to Daycare. I had a working gas heater that I was going to rig into my bus,
but the more I thought about it, I realized that I did not want to subject my
bus to the hazards of daily Ohio winter driving, including but not limited to
Copious amounts of road salt and Rednecks in Big 4X4's trying out their four
wheel drive in the snowy roads! So I sold the heater and now i would like to
update a recent trade offer I posted. I have a 66 Bug AND an 85 Cabriolet
Convertible which I need to either sell or Trade (I prefer to trade) for an
S.U.V. or Subaru Wagon ASAP. Here's the link with info:

I really love my current bus and plan on keeping it for a VERY long time, so
Make me an offer on the 2 V-Dubs.  BTW, we are located just North of
Cincinnati, Ohio


Peace, John Baker

headed on to the police officer's station...&quot;
