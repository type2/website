Well, there's no city near me, but I live just west of Yosemite Valley,
California.  You can find Yosemite easily on most maps as the green
almost-circle about 100 miles due east of San Francisco.

I have three running VW busses -- all Vanagons, no names.

1980 Westfalia, Yellow Deluxe Camper

1986 Vanagon GL, White 7-seater (scoutmobile)

1986 Kombi Syncro Transporter, red (originally white), front bucket
   seat variety, no other options (a basic stripped Kombi).

I also have a 1981 parts van
