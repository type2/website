Subject: Re: [T2] CB channels

I was under the impression that all the type 2 folks used channel 2, both
on CB and FRS.  I don't think that there would be interference between
multiple carabuses, and it might even be interesting if you got some skip
contacts between distant groups.  The sunspots are hot, so the skip is in,
like it or not!

&gt; Anybody have a list of the CB channels that the various carabusses will be using? I will be coming down from the Washington, DC area and will be trying to play &quot;catch-up&quot; to the other southward bound voyagers. With as many convoy's heading that way I would hope that I could catch one.
