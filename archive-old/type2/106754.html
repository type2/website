Subject: RE: [T2] Air Conditioning???

Quick question... I was curious if anyone had installed A/C in their
car.

Anyone done this? I do NOT want to cut a hole in my roof for a roof mounted
unit.


I've never mounted A/C in my car, but I have in my BUS.  Overhead unit too.  
Didn't have to cut a hole in the roof or anything.  I too have yet to 
experience the joys offered us by the CFC gods.  My '70 came with underdash 
A/C which was deteriorating faster than Michael Jackson's face.  I replaced 
said unit with an overhead-mounted version(following a complete disassembly 
and cleaning of some 2 decade-old grime from the unit's innards) and have 
yet to mount a compressor and receiver drier to finish the install.  I had 
to cut a hole in the floor to pass the mile of hose through to the engine 
compartment, but I obtained the plastic that covers the route as well.  Find 
yourself a donor bus, and you can even get the dash-mounted fan switch with 
VW-style knob!  Anyone know of a good source for LARGE condensers?  I have 
the original 3'x3' unit that mounted beneath the vehicle, but I can't 
imagine it would do the job as well as a new one.
