Subject: Utah bussers listen up.

I have ran across a non profit organization that needs some help. They have
had several campers donated to them, all in need of one thing or the other.
They have a 82 westy,78 westy and a 71 westy all poptops. Here is the deal-

They just want the 82 running, it has the engine torn down in the back seat.
I have a decent 79 engine gathering dust in my garage. If we get the 82
running with my engine they will trade the 78 and the 71. The 78 is medium
rusty, a pretty common Utah bus. The interior is complete but the cabinets
have been painted gray. It has something wrong in the front end. It has a
complete gas heater. IT HAS A COMPLETE GAS HEATER!  I haven't seen the 71
but will check it out this weekend.

I will throw in the engine and some of the labor but can't do it all(no
time).We could part out or use the other busses. It would be up for
negation. I think the most important thing is that we can help out an
organization that deals with the handicapped.

P-mail me if you are interested.
