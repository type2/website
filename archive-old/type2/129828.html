Subject: Z-Beds

Hiya All, 

As many of you already know Z-Products, the originator of the Z-Bed, out of 
Wilsonville, Oregon has gone belly-up. I'd like to get ahold of one of their 
kits (used or new) to convert a stock third seat into a Z-Bed. 

This is NOT the same as the folding third seat mechanism (commonly called a 
Z-Bed but technically is not) found in campers. The Z-Bed kit allows one to use 
the stock third seat and when not in use the interior appears completely 
stock. 

Does anybody out there have one of these kits they would part with? If so, 
I'm ready to do some negotiating.

Mike
