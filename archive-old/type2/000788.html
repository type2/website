&gt; Seems I'm the only one that thinks &quot;Vanagons&quot; will be sought after
&gt;in a few years.

I'm sure they will. The situation over here (Netherlands) is already as
follows:

Split
	Impossible to find. Sure if you want to pay $15 to $20K you can get one
(restored and all)
Bay
	Numbers are dwindling rapidly. Still possible to find one for around $1500.
But expect major
	bodywork and all the rest. Realistically you end up close to $5000 to get
it on the road in decent
	shape.
Vanagon
	Not that many left. Most ended up junked because no one wanted them after
their useful 	(business) life had expired. Value of remaining buses is quite
high.
	 An early Vanagon still fetches about $5000 and is the way to go if you
want a bus
	rather than a project.

The majority of VW-busses on the road are T4's (Eurovans). It's already
rumoured that a replacement is on the way (T5?).

The Vanagon is really the last of the breed. It still has many of the
characteristics of the original bus (i.e. motor in the back, boxer engine)
but in a vastly modernised form. The T4 is a different beast altogether.

So in a few years the Vanagon will be regarded as the pinnacle of bus
development. I happen to have a '77 bay which is in fairly good (original )
condition and an '81 Vanagon which by ignorant people is taxed at no more
than 5 years old (very straight body, no rust, exceptional for our climate).
I am definitely going to keep both and I am still looking for that rust-free
'66! (any offers?).
