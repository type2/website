&gt; Help me out here, people. If I am driving 60MPH down the highway, do you

Barry,

The major premise here is that the air pressure in the engine compartment
is positive.  I am not sure that is true.  If it is, then you are correct,
but I don't know.  This topic occurred a year or so ago (last summer as I
recall) and George Lyle said he could hook up a manometer and check it,
but I don't think he ever got that famous &quot;round tuit&quot; :-)  George?

My fear on the plug has little to do with the air leak, tho, and more to
do with flung (salt)water from the tires.  Even if there is a small
positive airflow thru the hole, it will not stop water drops thrown at
60+ mph by the tires.
