Subject: Re: [T2] Oil levels???

I experience this same thing with my pancake '77 bus.
I read in my printed busdepot catalog that VW oil filters
were suppose to have a valve that prevents oil from
draining down so that the engine isn't starved on startup.
So my theory goes that since I was just using a generic
oil filter (that didn't have this valve) the oil would drain 
down and appear to be higher (as read on the dipstick) 
after the bus had been sitting for a while and lower after 
the bus had been running..  

I have since changed the filter to a VW one and I think 
it still does the same thing.  So who knows?
