Hi Rick,

Not meaning to step on any toes but as a VW specialist/shop owner for over
30 years I must respectfully disagree with some of your conclusions. First,
it is a misnomer and unscientific to say oil breaks down. Remember, it was
tremendous heat and pressure that made the oil in the first place. It's been
around in one form for millions of years and remains as it is.  In use,
engine oil becomes contaminated and sludge-like in direct proportion to the
initial quality of processing, combined with heat and combustion byproducts.
In the 70's thru the 90's, I could always tell the Castrol 20W50 customers
when they came in...and they claimed 3K-mile oil change intervals.  Those
and the Pennsoil users all had the most sludge built up on the rocker area.
More paraffin left in the base oil during the refining process was
supposedly one of the culprits. Inferior additives/polymers (by today's
standards) that break down under heat complicated matters.  Valvoline 30wt
users were among the cleanest motors as evidenced by internal components
upon rebuilding.  A/C VWs are probably one of the best measures of an oil's
true quality.

Many newer oils hold combustion byproducts in better suspension, but I still
like changing the oil at 3K-mile intervals. Under normal use, that remains
the best guarantee your oil is doing its job.  With quality filtering,
synthetics are a better option than additives.  Jeff Raven's reference has
interesting info on additives and lawsuits
 http://www.geocities_dot_com/chrislonghurst/engineoil_bible.html
http://www.repairfaq_dot_org/filipg/AUTO/F_oil_facts.html is another good
resource that states: &quot;The wide viscosity range oils, in general, are more
prone to viscosity and thermal breakdown due to the high polymer content. It
is the oil that lubricates, not the additives. Oils that can do their job
with the fewest additives are the best&quot;

20w50 simply cannot protect as well as 40wt in hot climates.  The 40wt has
NO multi-viscosity polymers to break down under heat.  Again synthetics are
an exception here. Your test might prove something if engine oil just sat in
one place over a stove burner, but it doesn't do that.  My base oil
temperature never gets above 240.  I cringe at the thought of 280-degree
oil.

Jeff, if your engine has been around a bit, I would suggest running a 20W-50
weight oil.  With the hotter outside temps, the engine runs hotter to.  The
heavier weight will stick in your bearings that much longer after heating
up.  Also, from being around racing, I have learned that racing and VW
engines run much hotter than the standard water cooled cars, so the oil
breaks down quicker under the higher temps.  To avoid oil breaking down
before your next oil change and to keep the oil &quot;sticky&quot; at higher temps
which allow it to stay in the bearings longer, I
