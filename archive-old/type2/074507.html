Subject: Re: [T2] Push rod tub seals - uh oh.

You can expand the ring groves and they will fit properly.
Some books reccomend sealing the O rings and others never mention it.
Take your choice, either method works.

and fit just right, the old ones where red.  The inners 
&gt; (small
&gt; ones) are red and seem to be too narrow for the grove, the old ones 
&gt; fit
&gt; the grove perfectly and were black.
&gt; 
&gt; Do I have the wrong seals?
