AccessBob allowed as how
&gt;Mobil, Pennzoil, et al.  ... are selling top of the line quality 
&gt;synthetic lubricant.  Mobil
&gt;1 is getting $7 a qt/l  and the other guys the same, if it didn't cost
&gt;em a bunch more to be making this stuff do you think they wouldn't be
&gt;under cutting each other on the price.
&gt;
&gt;when you get a new rebuild they tell you to use regular dino oil for
&gt;the first 3000 miles or so, there is a reason, the sythetics lubricate
&gt;so well the engine will never seat it self or hone the pistons in.

	On my minor experience I agree with that.  Anyone dispute?
	There are running-in oils designed on this principle.  They 
lack some additives which would be desirable only if the oil was to 
be run far more than the 500 - 1000 mi at which they are dumped.

&gt;
&gt;oil is the blood of your engine (Bus blood) why spend $$$$ doin a top
&gt;of the line rebuild and then using 99cent bargin bin oil in it.

	For the reason you've just stated!

&gt;
&gt;my bus gets ALL synthetics oil, tranny fluid, even brake fluid and
&gt;grease and all from the big guys.... and I (knock on wood) have never
&gt;had a lubrication caused failure in over 25 years since Mobil 1 first
&gt;came out.  have enough other problems don't need lube problems.

	Many of the changes in sump oil this past couple decades have 
been to increase intervals between changes.  This is not a major 
consideration, esp with an engine such as the T1 which contains a 
tiny amount of sump oil anyway (compared with typical car or van 
motors).
	One of my schoolmates is now NZ's senior motoring journo, and 
has long been involved in racing (Jegwore D replica).  He reckons 
'old' motors like his burn far too much oil when on synthetic e.g 
Mobil 1  -  too much oil gets pumped upstairs and thence down the 
valve guides.
	Extremely low viscosity when cold e.g SAE 5W is desirable 
only in freezing weather.  In warmer climes it may allow hoons to rev 
motors abusively from a cold start, but wise drivers warm up motors 
gently.  At the bottom end of the viscosity range in a multigrade 
sump oil, 20W is low i.e will lubricate all parts of the motor within 
a short time from a cold start.
