Subject: Re: [T2] Losing Brake Fluid

Vincent said:


I`m losing brake fluid in my reservoir, But no dripping under the Bus. The  
 mechanic said that the Master cylinder was leaking into the engine and he  
recommends that I replace the Master cylinder  ($50)  and the booster or servo 
($200) plus labor and Tax, Total about $450.00
The mechanic also said that he has another customer who has the same  
 problem, but just keeps adding brake fluid in the reservoir.  It`s up to me.  I 
 like to keep my Bus in the best condition possible, But I also do not want to 
waste money and do unnecessary repairs.
My question is,  is this repair necessary, and is the price fair?
Any advice will be appreciated.

You are not leaking brake fluid into the engine. It is slowly filling up the booster 
on the master cylinder side. Soon, the fluid will fill the area and you will not be able 
to stop. The booster will be destroyed.
Right now, you NEED a new master cylinder. 
Depending on the level of brake fluid in the booster, you may need a rebuilt booster.
 
If you cannot do the labor yourself, the parts prices are fair for retail list price.
But the labor price is too high.

If you can do the labor yourself, the parts are cheaper.
