Steve,

   Thanks for the tip but I found an easy way to do this. I used a few Ideas
from the replies I got from this list. What I did is as follows.

Losen the bolt halfway.
Drip on the liquid rench
Tap medumly under both sides of the steering wheel at the same time
Loosen the bolt some more
Tap Again
Remove bolt
Tap again.

It was so nice the thing just popped off and I didn't pull any back muscles!

Now I have to get the Ignition Lock Cylinder out got a trick for that one?
I do not have a key. Or a clue! I took the whole colum to the locksmith to
let them futs with it.

Cheers,
And many thanks to the list!
