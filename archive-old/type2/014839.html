&lt;&lt; Max load 1356 LBS Per tire &gt;&gt;

Stan,

There's the problem, your bus requires at least a C load (truck) rating, 
which has a higher &quot;max load LBS per tire&quot; number.  It would appear that 
these are regular car tires.  

Max inflation on the correct bus tires should read around 50 or 55 lbs.  With 
a good load you need to be able to safely run 40 lbs in the rear. (safely 
meaning within the tire specs.)

Its even more important to have the tougher tires when you leave the pavement 
and get into the rocks and ruts!
