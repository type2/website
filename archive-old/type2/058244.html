&gt;Aye, but it's not all that easy to ignite, either. I doubt a spark

The smaller the piece, the easier it is to get it up to ignition
temperature.  A small flame will ignite a magnesium ribbon.  I don't
doubt that a grinding spark (say from hitting a bit of steel) could
ignite a magnesium dust particle.  If the dust is coating a surface
(particles close together) you could have a problem!

I don't think that this is a big concern, but it might be a good idea
to keep the area damp while grinding.  The water would absorb the heat
before the particles could be heated to ignition temperature.  A spray
bottle would be sufficient.  Note that this isn't to put out a fire,
just to prevent one from starting in the first place.
