&gt;I've got a couple of different opinions on this.  Leonard at AVP says there
&gt;is only one size of spacer for distributor drive shaft height on the type
&gt;IV.  He also said that they never cut the 'shoulder' on the case where the
&gt;spacer rides so it should be no different than when I sent it in.  

They may not cut it, but there are production tolerances and wear to factor
in.

&gt;BTW, can
&gt;distributor drive shaft height be measured without dismantling the engine?

Don't think so.  Wilson's method definately requires that you be inside the
case.  I think you can get an idea by how much play there is when you pull
the distributor shaft up, then push it down.  My feeling is that as long as
there is some play, but not too much, it's okay.  :-)

&gt;I feel pretty sure I could get enough advance (I need about 4-5 degrees to
&gt;get to spec at 5 degrees ATDC) if I could get a thicker spacer, but I don't
&gt;know how good that would be for the two gears involved.  The more I think
&gt;about this, the more I think the spacer might be the problem here.

I really doubt the spacer is the problem.  I would be suprised if it made
enough difference in the timing to push you out of your range of
adjustment.  I would think altering the spacer would only change the timing
a degree or two at the most, because of the angle of the gears.

&gt;You're scarin me here!!!

Sorry, I'm just callin 'em as I see em...

&gt;I do have a very limited range of movement.  The cold start valve (FI
&gt;remember) obstructs the vacuum advance preventing any further rotation of
&gt;the distributor in the advance direction.  

Can the cold start valve be moved?  Aside from that, I'm out of ideas.
