Subject: Bus for sale

I heard of the following Bus for sale.  I do not know the seler or any 
details beyond what I am writing here.  If interested contact Jay at (717) 
874-1300.

73 Hightop Camper (like the conversions done by Adventure Camper, only 
different company).
Has the stock 1700 motor in it and running, but also comes with a rebuilt 
1800.  Body is apparently in very good shape, as well as the interior.  
Seler is asking $1800.  
                               -Jon (c\o Ron Salmon)
