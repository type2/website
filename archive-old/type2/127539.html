Subject: Re: [T2] Sorry, tire question Yokohama Y 356

&gt; After going thru the T2 library, I found the type tire I want but can't seem
&gt; to find a distributor.
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone know if Yokohama Y 356 tires in D load range are still
&gt; available?

snoop
if you cant find a local distributor tirerack_dot_com will ship to you or
dropship directly to a local shop that can install them for you.
