could you volks look and see which way your dizzy is pointing at tdc on the
afore mention engine please. lets use the clock method looking at the motor
through the rear hatch. ie 1oclock, 3 oclock etc with 12 oclock pointing
straight up towards the front of the bus. i think tdc should be halfway
between 1 &amp;2 oclock. i know some out there will think im nuts but humour me
please, thanks. marty :) 72 westy
