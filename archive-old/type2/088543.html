Hi Guys

During years owning VW I have been wondered if my tune up's where made =
rigth, I mean not too advance to fry the engine, to too retard to loos =
power, correct gap in thge points and so on.
So I finally decide to get a Dwell Meter and Timing Ligth, I found then =
in eb*y at a very good price so I got them, they both are from Sears and =
of course they are used but are in good shape.
Using them I set the dwell angle ofmy points at 50=B0 (not easy at all, =
maybe ten times to got it), and the RPM were set at 900 (turnig the idle =
screw in a 30H31 solex carb, I have to made al laeast trhee full turns), =
then using the lamp I set the time alinging the 0=B0 mark in the pulley =
with the engine seam.
I took the bus around the block to verify every thing was O.K but the =
bus does not run smooth some hesitage uphill and some loos of power, =
before the timing the bus felt strong and firm (maybe too advance or =
every thing was O.K and I mess it up the whole thing). any help  or idea =
is very very welcome.

From the sunny land of Caracas, Venezuela
