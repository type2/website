I'm running out of ideas...

I've got an '80 manual Vanagon U.S. model.

A couple months back I moved it out in front of my house.

It hasn't started since...it did this once before but I managed
to jump start it after charging it's battery overnight and with 
a running jump from my Chevy.

I've replaced the starter/solenoid with a new/rebuilt, replaced 
the ignition switch though I don't think I needed to...

Now I can get the starter to spin using a remote starter clipped directly
to the solenoid or by bridging the wires in the ignition switch harness, but
it still won't do anything using the key.

Since bridging the harness works I'm assuming the wires from front to 
back are good...

Since there are wires to the alternator and the fuel pump off the solenoid
I'm assuming that somewhere along those lines something is not connecting 
and keeps the starter from turning...

Any ideas?   Please reply to me via email- dhaslup_at_erols_dot_com

(My only other thought was a faulty fuel injection control computer since
I had a problem on a GM car that was caused by the computer...trouble is 
I've only found this one through dealers and it lists for $595 so I don't
want to keep trying things that cost that much.)

Thanks in advance...
