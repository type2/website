Subject: Everybus_dot_com and busesofthecorn_dot_com coming down for
  maintainance

The machine that runs the everybus_dot_com and busesofthecorn_dot_com web sites
(and receives my mail and all) is both horribly out of date on the OS and
full of someone's pictures :-) I was considering options when I was an ad
for an 80GB HDD fro $40 after rebates...  .50/GB!!!!!!  Entirely
BOVINE!!!!!  So...

Both domains are coming down in ~15 minutes.  They will be down for a
minimum of 4-6 hours with a maximum of the same (If I totally screw things
up, I'll just throw the old HDD back in)
