Subject: Re: [T2] Starting problem - Update

I second the warranty statement Karl said. I worked at a FLAPS and the ONLY difference between the top battery and the cheap battery was the fancy logo sticker (basic battery had a VERY generic label) and the warranty. The top battery cost would have equalled TWO of the cheap batteries. 2 batteries for the price of the 1 of the same batteries + warranty. 

I will prob need a battery this winter. Going on 6 years in my CR-V with the factory battery. A bit sluggish in the cold, not that we have had any yet...
