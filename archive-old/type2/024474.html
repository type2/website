I'm having a garage sale:

bug cases (can work in buses with a little work) , a mexican and AE 1600 bus 
case,  a 73 super beetle trans, a 69 bus trans, an 80 vanagon trans, a 66 big 
nut tranny that needs rebuilding, an assortment of  fan housings, engine tin, 
28 thru 34 pict carbs, a 66 steering box with a bit of play, a 73 front bus

I'm looking for $50 on the cases &amp; front beam, $20 on the fan housings, 
steering box &amp; sliders, $5-$10 on the rebuildable carbs, heads, panel etc.
