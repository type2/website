Subject: [T2] Engine ate part of my carb

Hello all,

while doing some maintenance work on my '78 westy (2.0l with dual carbs) I
tried to adjust the carbs. (Apparently the engine needed more gas at high
rpm's). Upon closer inspection I noticed that the small bent tube which
injects the gas (&quot;Einspritzroehrchen&quot; in german, see item # 26
(http://vwbus.dyndns_dot_org/bulli/michaelk/vw_bus_d/fiche/t201410.gif) ) on the
left carb was gone.

Now my questions:
Is it very likely that the tube damaged the engine (replacement engine,
10.000 miles on it)? (It still runs surprisingly good even without it.)
Is there a way to replace it? (Do I need some special tools, because I think
it's pressed in the carb)

Since I have complete Megasquirt and Megajolt lite units on my test-bench
ready for installation this seems to be some last revenge of the carbs :-)

Thanks a lot,

Timo
