Subject: [T2] Cutting plans arrived

Space Craft sent me a nice letter &amp; diagrams for making a single seat or
fridge unit just inside the sliding door, also the plans for making a sink
unit that is next to the bed &amp; goes over the wheel arch. These are hand
drawn &amp; I really appreciate Steve who runs 'Space Craft' going to this
effort to draw these up! If you want a copy send me an email, I will send
back or post on the net depending on demand.
These are pretty good if like me &amp; have never seen eye 2 eye with wood!
