Subject: Re: [T2] Propane Problems (busted by the fire marshal)




&gt; You need to get your heating system up to factory specs and maybe add a
squirrel cage fan or two.  Propane will kill you, dude.
&gt;
And Propane will not kill you... Lack of Oxygen will.   And as many times as
my bus has been hit, There is no way it will ever be airtight again.
Solving that problem.  Which is another reason why I need aux heat. And
those squirrel cage blowers do nothing except at idle.  The engine fan
overpowers those blowers as soon as it is moving.  If you want real power
install a bilge blower midstream.  which I have.  And for everyone that
knows me I really like it warm...

Peace Brother,
snoopy
