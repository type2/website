Subject: Re: [T2] cheap welder? 

James,

$200 - not likely, and if so, not a good welder. Now
for $300-$350 you can get a Lincoln SP-100, which is a
nice wire-feed welder, which is convertible to MIG.
The MIG kit will cost you another $100, and the gas
and bottle another $100 beyond that, but is well worth
it. 

A lot of local community colleges have welding
classes, and if you've never done it, it's well worth
the time and money to take one.

&gt; Can anyone tell me where these &quot;cheap&quot; welders are
&gt; to be found?  I'm in
&gt; new england , I have been told by someone at a vw
&gt; show that &quot;if you can
&gt; breath you can use a wire feed welder to replace
&gt; panels&quot; but i'm looking
&gt; for someplace to learn before i start cutting pieces
&gt; off my bus.  My
&gt; grandfather was a welder but unfortunately passed
&gt; away before i could
&gt; learn from him.  of course actually doing body work
&gt; will have to wait
&gt; for warmer weather but i like to stock up on tools
&gt; and parts in the
&gt; winter.
&gt; Thanks alot, you guys are the best.
