&gt; I would like to convert my 1800 bus to LPG. I have asked everyone here in

&gt; this propane conversion? Does it work OK? Apparently, you add a regulator
&gt; which is heated by either the exhaust or oil. Seems simple enough.

I have seen it, it apparently works, but I have no information on it

&gt; My primary objective is to save money, as unleaded petrol (91 Octane) is
&gt; approx. 75c/litre, and the LPG would work out to approx. 55-65% cheaper!

you may not get the results you seek, there are fewer BTU's in LPG than
gas per liter.  therefore your fuel mileage is quite a bit less, and you
need larger fuel tanks to get the same range.

my understanding is that actual cost of fuel is about the same per mile
driven.  however the engine burns much cleaner so you save on things like
oil changes
