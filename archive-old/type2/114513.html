&lt;&lt; But where is the bar held to? There is no way a bus of any vintage
over 20 years could possibly be as safe as the new vehicles on the
roads now, with all the safety devices installed. So what standards
are we as bus owners held to? It's a very hard decision. Lots of
unsafe vehicles are on the road daily.  &gt;&gt;

I'd be curious as to how such laws are applied...Are 20+ year old
Mercedes or BMW's held to the same stringent standards (or even
stopped as often) as VW's, or 2CV's, or Opels...? Is/are the laws
being applied on a 'level playing field'... ? Or (heaven forbid!) are
the inspection laws a form of economic profiling...? Any comments
from across the pond...?
