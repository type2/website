Well, I finally got around to changing the oil and filter on my newly =
acquired 77 Westy and things aren't looking so good. If I'm mistaken =
about my findings, please let me know:
The engine is the original and has almost exactly 100,000 miles on it. I =
bought it from the original owner, and he said it's never given him any =
problems aside from a slow, persistant oil leak. After driving it around =
for a week, I decided that I should investigate a noise that I thought =
could be a bearing going south. Took it to a VW mechanic friend because =
I don't know much about T4 motors, been a splitty guy all my life. He =
said that he heard something too, and to try straight 40 oil to see if =
the noise would go away due to thicker oil taking up a bit more slack in =
the clearances. So today I drained the oil and replaced the filter =
(that's gotta be the stubbiest looking filter I've ever seen! I figured =
I'd use a Bosch filter for the good German karma) and while cleaning the =
screen, sure enough, there were little bits of flattened metal. Since it =
looked similar to the debris left in the bottom of the case of my '63 =
Standard when it destroyed a wrist pin bearing, I'm assuming that I've =
got some major work ahead of me. Any chance that some flakes in the =
screen is actually ok? I actually ran the oil out of the old filter over =
my fingers to see if I would find any more chunks, but didn't see =
anything. I suppose if I took all the pieces that I saw and put them =
together, it probably wouldn't cover my pinky finger nail, and when my =
'63 went south, there was metal everywhere inside the case. After =
putting the 40 weight in, the sound didn't go away. I haven't done the =
valve/timing job yet, but it seems that that could be a moot point =
considering what I found today.

So, I guess I'm looking for someone to tell me that I've got awhile =
before it gets real bad and I start destroying major engine parts, but =
please let me know if I should bike to work tomorrow. Anyone in CO got a =
late model FI engine they wouldn't mind parting with? I'm already =
building an engine for my '63, so I don't have time for another rebuild =
at the moment. Thanks for any thoughts or suggestions!
