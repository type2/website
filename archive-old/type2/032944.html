Steven,

Years ago (more than I care to count) I dealt with the same problem in a '64
Econoline van:  I bought different-sized flexible plugs from the local hardware
store (I think this was pre-Home Despot .. yikes) and fitted them into the
holes as best I could; I made sure the flatter side of each plug faced upwards,
or flattened a plug by hand/knife if it was too domed.  The odd-sized holes
(ones that wouldn't take a plug) I redrilled to the next size larger .. then I
cut corresponding holes (where needed) in pieces of plywood subfloor to fit
over the plugs so the floor didn't end up all lumpy and uneven.  It worked
pretty well .. as I was stationed on the east coast of Fla, it was inevitable
that my plug job would outlast the rest of the van, which succumbed to coastal
cancer (rust).

Hope this helps.

&gt; Hi all!
&gt; This coming holiday weekend I will have time to install my floors and
&gt; paneling(insert wooohooooo! here) My one concern(well, main concern) is the
&gt; various holes in my floor. It seems that there are a dozen or so 1/2 inch to
&gt; inch size pre-drilled holes in diff places. I would assume for options and
&gt; middle seats and such. although after 26 years there has never been still
&gt; water resting in there or coming up through them(how this HASNT happened I
&gt; dont know) but after I put in my insulation and wood floors the last thing I
&gt; want is water rotting everything. with out welding, what can be done to
&gt; these holes? I was thinking a silicone sealant smeared across them?
&gt; any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!
&gt; thanks for reading this
