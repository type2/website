Jim:
Vanagon 16's did this. (A Vanagon 16 is a not-for- US Syncro with 16 inch wheels and monster tires and fender flares and such.) I think there are few up in BC that use them off-road. Anyone listening?

&gt; Hello Fine List People:
&gt;
&gt; We're all familiar with the spare tire mounted on the front of a bus, but has anyone mounted a spare on the back hatch, kind of SUV-style??  I figure you could use the same mounting kit as used for the front.  Also, the sheet metal may have to be reinforced, and maybe a lift-gate shock absorber-type of thing may need to be added to handle the extra weight of the tire.  Has anyone done this??
