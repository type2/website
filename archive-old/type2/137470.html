&gt; I don't think one fully explains the other. How did a 350HP 6-cyl pass

Presumably, the heat that the VW engine runs at is a major factor.  The 
Porsche engines used nickies for quite a long time, didn't they?  The 
ability to use aluminum, rather than cast iron, cylinders probably made 
a huge impact in heat-related emissions (NOX?).

Remember... those Porsche engines lasted a lot longer, too... For 
example, it seems as if Porsche people are generally of the opinion 
that a well-maintained '72 911T w/ 100K on the engine still has a LOT 
of life in it (50K or more) before a rebuild is required.  How many VW 
people think the same way? :-)
