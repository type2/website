&gt; Anyone have a VW reference that lists displacement by motor numbers?? I
&gt; need to know what size the following are;
&gt; 
&gt; CB104218    1.7L or 1.8L???
&gt; EA067548 (from a  411 or412???) 1.7L or 1.8L??
&gt; 
&gt; CB is a dual carb 1.7 from a 72-73 bus..the 73 would have the smog pump (or
&gt; the remains of it's mounts anywhere from 63-68 hp, depending on who you
&gt; believe
&gt;  EA 1.7 FI engine from a 72-411 or 73 412 *automatic* (remember to put the
&gt; pilot bearing in the end of the crank for bus use) should be 78 hp with the
&gt; FI...
&gt; CB in my 72 bus developed 37 hp at the wheels, the EA in the same bus, had 49
&gt; and the W series 1.7 FI,  66 hp!
&gt; These are uncorrected HP figures on the same Clayton water brake, during the
&gt; course of several months..but you get the idea I never put the carbs on an EA
&gt; but drove one..seemed &quot;stronger in the mid range...but, thats kinda
&gt; subjective,no?
&gt; Stop wishing for a 1.8..they were less powerful, with smaller valves and
&gt; all....
Steve:
I think 74 1.8's did have bigger valves-41 vs. 39 intake and 35 vs.33(?)
exhaust and I think 75's may have had the same size also.
My question: Waht is a W- series motor?
Al Brase
69 double cab
