Subject: Re: [T2] Heater lever

Guys,

Thes sets I got look good...I haven't tried them yet because I had already 
repainted the originals and did not want to take them back off of the arms 
until I had to do some &quot;under the gauges&quot; work.


Cheers, dave

&gt; Dave Bolen bought a few sets from me a while back.  Any word on how they've
&gt; worked out, Dave?
&gt; 
&gt; properly (not binding or hanging up), the new ones should work well.  At
&gt; least the prototype castings have in my own bus.
