Subject: Passenger side Seat for Walkthrough camper
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I am in need of a passenger side seat for my 1966 walkthrough camper.  This
side does not have any tracks for the seat, however, I have been told that
this is the way it should be.  If so, I would greatly appreciate it if
anyone can help me find a restorable seat.  Thanks in advance.
