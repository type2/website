&gt;Lets think about this. These cold air intake kits are, by and large, for
&gt;water pumpers. With a water pumper, air comes through the radiator, gets
&gt;hot, and then gets sucked into the carb (or throttle body). A cold air
&gt;intake for this engine makes sense.

If you look at the shape of those intakes, they are in a position where the filter is down low and out of the way of the radiator with an opening to the side. I don't know why they are called cold air intakes because the OEM units are often in the exact same spot. Cool air intakes would be a more appropritate name: the aftermarket versions have a tuned tube and it makes a &quot;cool&quot; sound.
