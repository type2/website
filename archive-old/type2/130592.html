&gt; Stock '79 2.0L WITH CALIFORNIA EMISSIONS.  This means that there is no

&gt; same part number) as the '75-78  injectors that use the resistor 
&gt; block?

They're compatible.  The resistors moved to either the harness or ECU 
(can't remember which, exactly), but they're still there.

&gt; Can anybody recommend a place to purchase new ones?  I read awhile 
&gt; back that Autozone carried these for like $35.  Is this true and do 
&gt; these work well?

Genuine Bosch injectors?  If so, that's great.  But I wouldn't 
personally use anything other than genuine Bosch.

See Richard Atwell's fuel injector info page for some suggestions on 
part numbers to hunt for.
