&gt;FIRST: What year did the A/C start appearing in Type II's ???

Don't know - I've seen it in a '71 bus, and my '73 has it (both aftermarket
of course).  I think someone on the list once said they saw A/C in a
splitty.

&gt;SECOND: Has anyone ever transplanted A/C into their bus ??? I know this will
&gt;be a great feat, but well worth the bother.

Mine came with broken A/C but by the time I got done replacing parts the
only thing that was original was the condensor.  At the outset, it looked
like a ton of work.  In the middle of the job, it didn't seem so bad but
now that I am done I once again feel like it was a huge amount of work.
:-)  Also cost some money.  I had all new hoses made and got by with all
other parts used - total expenditure was around $400 including gauges and
R-134A (134A works great, btw).  A friend of mine had someone else do the
whole thing from scratch in his '70 Westy and I believe it cost him around
$1,800.  Ouch.  It's amazing what people will pay for A/C in Texas - that
includes me.

When I finally get my bus to the dynamometer (need exhaust work done first,
I'm considering O2 sensor and a cat converter to clean it up and quiet it
down) I will make a pull with and without A/C to find out once and for all
how much HP it takes.  I'm guessing not more than 2 or 3.
