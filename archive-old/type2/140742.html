Subject: Re: [T2] fuel lines

From cdavid:

I had a leaky hose between the gas tank and the first run of metal 
tubing, which I replaced with same length as was there. So I know that 
was part of the fuel problem. But still not getting the fuel up to the carb.
The pump is fairly new, but I will also be checking this.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Maybe a dumb question but:

What are you using for a fuel pump on a 2.0 and where is it mounted?
