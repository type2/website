&gt; does anyone know where to find what year my engine?  My engine code is AE
S
&gt; 524 288. I believe my bus has had a engine change  some where along the
&gt; line.   Is there much change between 70  and 71 engine?
That is a 1600 DP, originally installed in a 71 Type 1 or maybe a 71 Bus.
since yours is a '70, it is not the original engine which would be a &quot;B&quot;
series 1600 single port.  The engine code/mfg. date info is available in the
Muir idiot book.
