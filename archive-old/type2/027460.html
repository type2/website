Tony,
The pols have worked their magic and passed a law to spread the exorbinant 
electric charges over several months' billing periods, but no price 
rollback! At the same time the Air Resources Board recommitted to require 5% 
of new vehicles sold in the state to be zev's by 2003 (accuracy of those 
numbers may be in question). So in a tight electric market, more people will 
be using the wall plug to run their cars! Hey, I've got to log off to 
conserve electricity and my wallet. Bye for now.
Roland
