Subject: Fuel restrictor

The saga:

Everything that I need to pass smog in California was missing from my 
bus, which is why I got it for $400. Among the things on the list was a 
torn fuel restrictor. Badly torn -- nothing left to work with. The 
following is a description of what not to do and what won't work -- ask 
me how I know.

First, forget getting a restrictor from a Vanagon. Looks like it might 
fit, but it doesn't -- won't -- can't. The Vanagon restrictor makes about 
an 80 or 85 degree turn, but late busses need about 97 degrees or darn 
close, and there is no room for fudging.

Have tried the Vanagon route and failed, I combed the junkyard for 
something that might work. Finally settled on a steel restrictor from 
some Japanese car. Hacksawed away most of the tube, leaving a flange, the 
restrictor, and about 5/8&quot; worth of metal to clamp a hose to. That's just 
not enough for safety, and even then the tubing makes the bend doubtfully.

So then I called RMMW, which lists the part for 39.95. Discontinued.

Back to the junkyards. I found a restrictor in a '78 that was torn for 
1-1/2&quot; in two places, but otherwise intact. Bought it, buffed the inside 
with sandpaper, and put a 1&quot; x 2&quot; inner tube patch in place. Now the 
thing feels solid more or less. Since my tank is full, I don't need to 
pass gasoline by the crude repair before having the thing smogged. I just 
hope the patch doesn't find just the wrong spot in my tank.

But the bottom line is that the combination of the redesign of the fuel
filler in the last several years of the baywindow, plus the (apparently
unanticipated) requirement for a restrictor on California buses, yields a
very bad design. The best resolution, which I may pursue since I will have
to pass smog again in two years, is to surgically graft a door and pocket
from an early bay donor onto my bus, and then install a steel restrictor
from some other car.
