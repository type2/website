Subject: Re: [T2] Window rubber stains

My bus had been sitting in a yard for a long time and
the rubber is old and powdery. I soaked it with rubber
tire silicon treatment and it helped a little. 

Then, 4 thehellofit, I PAINTED one section with a
satin black oil-based paint. So far, it's worked. no
more powder run off.
