...sounds like the solonoid on the starter motor has stuck.They all
do it eventually and need to be serviced or replaced.
A few gentle hits with a hammer or other suitable whacking implement
on the side of the solonoid will generally get it unstuck,but
it will happen again,maybe tomorrow,maybe not for months but it may
as well be fixed properly as soon as you are able.
The final straw for me is when I have to lie down on a wet road on a
cold rainy night and then I finally fix it right...
In the meantime,a hammer will get you out of trouble.

&gt;
&gt;Make sure your terminal posts are really clean.  I'm serious about
&gt;that!  Mine were nasty once, and for a year I couldn't figure out why I
&gt;wasn't getting any battery power.  It would be on and off.. it was
&gt;REALLY annoying.  Changed the starter, checked wiring and then finally
&gt;changed the terminals.  worked like a charm from then on.. then I got
&gt;rid of the bus... and bought another, of course :)
&gt;
&gt;Also, if you bus got hot, your starter may have temporarily seized..

&gt;&gt; You will need a digital multimeter (VOM) to verify voltages and resistance.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Verify battery condition and charge. Verify alternator output under load.
&gt;&gt; Verify cables and ground straps. Verify volts from ign. switch to starter.
&gt;&gt; If you haven't solved the problem by then, replace the starter motor.

&gt;&gt; &gt;HI,
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;Our bus won't start.  It drove just fine, we parked it.  And when we
went to
&gt;&gt; &gt;start it to leave again, it just &quot;clicks&quot;, but won't crank over.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;It can be push started.
