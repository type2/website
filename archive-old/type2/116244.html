&gt; Can anyone out there snap a few photos of the proper heater hose

&gt;
&gt; As you can see from this photo of mine:
&gt;
&gt; 	http://www.shagadelic_dot_org/photos/pod/liveframe.cgi/76-westy/5
&gt;
&gt; ...there is that hose that arcs across the pulley area.  I don't 
&gt; remember seeing that hose in other Type 4 engine photos I've seen, and 
&gt; I'm trying to figure out:
&gt;
&gt; 	- What it's supposed to do.
&gt; 	- If it's supposed to even be there.

&quot;Nevermind!&quot;  That was a quick hack done at the shop when the PO took 
it in some time in the past... the wrong engine tin was present, so the 
mechanic effectively plugged the holes that were defeating the airflow 
with that hose.

...and I won't have to look at that hose anymore from now now... Buslab 
is installing the correct tin when the new engine goes in.
