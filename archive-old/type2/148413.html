&gt; IF you have the tire model and size, the tire dealer should be able to
&gt; match and order a replacement, if it is still in production.

   Careful, tho'...Even a new (to you) tire could be old...Modern tires
should have a manufacturing date stamped on them...Three/four
year old tires are old, even if unused...(Now accepting tales of all 
those driving on original VW tires... ;-(
