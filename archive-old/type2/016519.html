Subject: carb questions 

hello list,
 first i am running an 1835 with a cam and a weber progressive in my
bus. i have had different people tell me pull that weber and put on a
bug spray. ok fine what is it? i found one today for sale in the paper.
holley 2110. 2 barrels one for each bank. been sitting in a garage for
awhile. poured some gas in it and it leaked out the throttle shaft.
there is also play in the shaft. anyone know if this can be fixed?
any opinions on this carb verses the weber? any and all feedback
appreciated.
thanks
rory mccormick
