Subject: thermostat has different attachment

Hey all,
I got this thermostat nos german, for my 78
It looks just like the old one but the screw-on
part that attaches to the cable it a little smaller
than the part that is on the cable now.
Is this the wrong part or can I make it work?
thanks for any advice.
