Subject: My single cab lives( but generator light is on)

Volks,
Finally fired up the Single Cab today............ Those of you may remember
me buying it in August, and immediately pulling the motor to
rebuild.......very little was salvageable, so new case, everything balanced,
and built a 1776.

Finally fired er up today....broke it in for 20 minutes, discovered both my
oil drain pans were full, so will drain them out tomorrow.

One issue I did discover is that my generator light is on.  When I was
hooking the leads back to the generator, the stud that holds the blue wire
kept coming loose.  i had to keep retightening it with its jambnut.
Anything else I could have missed?  It sounds great.  I have to full with
the shift linkage a little, for it is not smooth through the gears like it
was before (ran it around the block after break in) Reverse is found easily,
but the others are tough to find ...........I had dropped the tranny and
rebushed the nose cone and shift rod.........prior to this fix the shifter
was sloppy as heck..........

Any advice on these problems would make me a happy driver of the only bay
window single cab in my area!
