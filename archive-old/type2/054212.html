&gt;Radar detector?   i might have use for one in my bus
&gt;so if it goes off, i need to speed up to the minimum
&gt;highway speed:)   i can see it now:&quot;Do you know why i
&gt;pulled you over?&quot;...&quot;no sir&quot;....&quot;Well, we have a speed
&gt;limit in this state, and we would like you to at least
&gt;maintain it!!&quot;
&gt;just kiddin Blake, it is friday;v)

No offense taken.  I have yet to break any speed limits in my bus, but I
have been hounded by the National Park Cops...  Another good use for the
socket is for your Trolling for Taillights Apparatus.  I've put up a page in
memory of this Great List Tradition, for those who weren't here in 1996 or
thereabouts...
