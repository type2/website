 The subject says it all. My VWFLAPS has a step stud
 that goes from 10mm 
 to 8mm and is about 36mm long. Will that work, or
 should I use a 
 time-sert? Which is preferred, and of course... why?
 
 Thanks

Not if you have a 70 Westy.

Why?

Because a 68 to 70 VW bus uses a single port engine.
Single port intake studs are 6mm.
