Subject: Re: [T2] Best way to mount sliding windows

Personally I wouldn't do this, I think it will be noisy.

&gt; The only reason (that I know of) that I wouldn't want to do this is 
&gt; because now the slit between the windows is facing the wrong direction 
&gt; and would be &quot;catching&quot; the passing air, possibly allowing air to leak in.
