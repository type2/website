Subject: Can't shift into 3rd or 4th

A friend of mine who is not on the list had this problem and I thought I'd
post about it for the benefit of others. The part that failed was 004 301
241A.

&quot;And yes, the bus is fixed, happily shifting, I never knew it was supposed
to shift to smoothly and tightly. I pulled the engine and tranny together,
opened the nose cone, and voila! The shift ball has eroded to the size of a
little girl's toe ring!  From the shape of a sphere to the shape of a ring.
At that point (when I made my famous descent from the Santa Cruz Mts.) and
tried to shift into 3rd gear after the 17 to 280 exit, the toe ring slid up
the hockey stick shaft from the end it is supposed to rest.  And that is how
I found it, with pieces of it also at the bottom of the housing, the rest of
the ball I guess homogeneously in the oil.&quot;
