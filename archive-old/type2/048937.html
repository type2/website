Subject: Re: [T2] Volkswagen Parts Manual

[...]

&gt; I have borrowed a 1968  VW DealersipType2  T2(covers 1968 to 1971) Parts
&gt; book. I plan on making some copies this weekend. The manual is printed on
A4
&gt; hole punched paper and is contained in the original 4 post binder. I have
&gt; been looking it over and cannot figure out how to remove the posts so I
can
&gt; get the pages out. They posts appear to be riveted. Any ideas? I have to
do
&gt; this in a non  destructive way :)

I have the M book, type1 + type2, part 1 which covers engines. Look at the
top inner edge for the little lever. Push it down. This will release the
cover. Then you can remove the 4 pin piece.....
