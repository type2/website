 &gt; I will be ripping up my bathroom floor this weekend. (what fun)  Since
&gt; we only have one bathroom, I figured this would be a good time to get a
&gt; porta potti for camping.  Is the Porta Potti brand a good one or is there
&gt; something better for under $100?  I am looking for any opinions on this as I
&gt; will buy something tomorrow.  Thanks.

Pat, go to Sears, they sell the Thetford brand which I have learned is about
as good as you can buy.  Get the largest, 6 gallon I think, it will be a bit
taller and more useful in the long run (no pune intended).
