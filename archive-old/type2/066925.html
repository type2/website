Subject: Re: '67 split carb question

&gt;&gt;  Can someone identify a aluminum riser block on my '67 that is bolted
&gt;&gt;between the carburator and manifold? It is about 1 1/2 inch tall and has
&gt;&gt;some sort of mechanism sticking out the side that has a vertical plate about
&gt;&gt;2&quot; x3&quot; bolted to it. the plate says 28 DR-15. As you look at the engine from
&gt;&gt;the rear of the bus you look right at it, as it directly in front of the
&gt;&gt;carb. It kind of seems to be some sort of a governor but I have no idea. Any
&gt;&gt;thoughts would be appreciated. thanks

Yes, thats a governor.  To adjust, take off the topmost front screw holding
on the tab, and tighten the top bolt to kick it in later, loosen it to kick
it in sooner.
