Hello Paul
You Asked:

&quot;Anyway, on to the subject at hand.  I need new covers for the seat/bed,
jump seat, and cushions in my 71 westy.  Does anyone have instructions
on how to make them?  I recently made new curtains following someones
instructions and am pleased with how they came out.  So of course that
makes me wonder if I could make the seat covers too.  Any and all help would
be appreciated
   If it appears beyond me, I wouldn't be opposed to buying the covers.
So any and all recommendations for vendors would be appreciated too.&quot;


We also made our curtains for our 72 Westy Weekender which gave me the
desire to make new seat covers for the font seats. I had already covered
the other seats with denim.

The Rear Seats:
To cover the seat-bed and jump seat I removed them from the bus, the bed
back and bottom are attached with 6 screws each, once removed you can
easily cover them, I used staples to secure everything down. On my bed
the original Mustard covers where worn out so I removed them, however on
the back cushion it was good, so I left it secured in place.

The jump seat bottom is no problem either, however the rear of the jump
seat is attached into the wood with staples, at least mine was, so this
made the job of a clean look more difficult, however I did tap the back
from the frame keeping the staples in tact, covered the back with the
stapes going thru my new material and then hammered it back onto the
frame. On the one side that faces the isle of the bus I used upholstery
tacks for a finished look as oppose to having staple show.

Now for the front seats:
I was going to &quot;just&quot; cover my front seats which I had done with a
generic seat cover from my FLAPS, however I had a extra set of seats
where the covers where almost gone, so I decided to MAKE my own Seat
Covers from the old pattern. What I did and what you can do is take the
seat covers off of there frames, then over the next two weeks in your
spare time start separating the seat covers at the seams, Before I
separated any of the covers I used a marker to label each section and
drew arrows at meeting points so I wouldn't be confused latter. Once
separated you will need to iron all of the sections flat, this is so
your patterns will be correct. After all of the covers had been ironed I
started marking my patterns on the Denim I used. Mark only the back side
and use a sharpie that is close to your seat cover color for marking,
once you have them marked then cut them out.
Remember you have to sew two opposite sides to make the covers correct,
if you study how you take the seams apart it makes the sewing back
together a breeze.

I still have the covers that I used for patterns, for a fee I would be
glad to make you or any one else on the list some patterns, just let me
know. I also have the patterns for the Head Rest that was used on 74-
busses.

Or if you think this job is too big I also have a set of White Seat
Covers, they are from some old stock so they should actually fit, they
are of NOS Quality, not sure of the manufacture?

Good Luck, our seats LOOK AWESOME!

Meredith
