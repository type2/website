Subject: Westy Battery Charger/Converter

As I was getting the westy ready for the weekend festivities today I
went to turn on the fridge and get the battery charging from shore
power.  After a little troubleshooting I realize that the transformer in
my stock charger has gone bad.  I like to keep most everything in my bus
stock (with the exception of Megasquirt) so I was wondering if anyone
out there might have a working charger/converter that they would like to
give up for cash, parts, beer, etc.?
 
Happy 4th to everyone and happy bussing!
