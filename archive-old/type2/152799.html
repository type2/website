Subject: Re: [T2] speaking of brakes

I have heard of newer cars, when you reverse with the e-brake on it actually
tightens the e-brake. I don't believe the buses ever came with this
option....
 I am assuming the bus is in Neutral when drifting backwards down the
incline?
 This could be a simlar problem as I had with mine, if the wheel cylinders
arent attached or secured to the backing plate, the wheel cylinders could be
moving. Or maybe your little springs that hold the shoes to the backing
plate could be missing, allowing the shoes to move back and forth thus
creating the drag....
 Or maybe I need to go get some coffee...brain hurts ACK! Gosh I didnt think
I would need much recovery for my 21st b-day (yesterday)!!!

&gt; just yesterday I noticed that my brakes (78 auto tranny bus) seem to be
&gt; dragging when I'm going backwards. no evidence of any hang up in forward.
&gt; everything else seems normal, I tested it on a slight incline in
&gt; neutral, facing forward the bus drifts normally (I use this incline to
&gt; test other things too) but facing backwards the bus barely drift and comes
&gt; to an early stop... wheels feel normal, but I mostly drive forward.
&gt;
&gt; no other symtoms, new brake pads and shoes about 5,000 miles ago...
