&gt; The issue du jour is  oil pressure relief valve pistons.  Specifically,
&gt; whether one piston or both pistons should have a groove near the top.  
&gt; In
&gt; two of my engines, only one piston has such a groove. In the other, 
&gt; neither
&gt; piston has a groove.
&gt;
&gt; On p29 of the engine section of Orange Bentley, one photo shows two
&gt; grooveless pistons and another shows a grooved piston.
&gt;
&gt; Can anyone clarify this for me?

I know that the pressure-control-valve(i.e. front (FIF)) piston/plunger 
on my 1600DP does NOT have a
groove.  Haven't had the other one out recently enough to remember one 
way or the
other.
