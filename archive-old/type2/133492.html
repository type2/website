&gt; &gt; So, where do you mount your extinguisher?

&gt;
&gt; That way both front seats have immediate access to it. I agree there's
&gt; no point to putting it anywhere in the back.

got mine mounted right behind the front drivers seat, can reach it from
the drivers seat and because I use the sliding door to get in and out all
the time it is right there for me to grab.

only time I needed it for this bus is once when I put my spare engine in I
was driving and stopped and this black oily smoke was coming out from
under the van.,appears a mouse had built a nest in the air exhaust duct
from the cooling system and it caught fire from the heat and there was
some leaked oil on the site.._dot_used one of the powder fire ext on the
fire, put it right out but boy what a mess to clean up...still have a
powder ext, figure better to clean up mess than lose bus but still looking
around for a decent sized CO2 as a first line of defense, will keep the
powder as backup

PS-never did find the mouse
