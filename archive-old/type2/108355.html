You need a new head stud.  NLA from VW, so you'll have to get one off a
donor vehicle, or contact a head rebuilder for one.  Get new nuts while
you're at it.  There's no way of salvaging that stud now.

&gt; One little 11mm nut that holds the valve rockers on just goes round and
&gt; round, doesn't tighten. You know the one? There are four of them under the
valve
&gt; cover. I was replacing the valve guide tube gaskets and now I have this
new
&gt; problem.
&gt;
&gt; Do I have to replace the bolt or the whole head thingie? Is there a
something
&gt; that will recut the threads? I switched nuts around so I know it is not
that.
