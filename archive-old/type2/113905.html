&gt;ok i figured it out. it was the ignition switch. i can run the bus now by starting it, then turning the key back to a contact point, it takes a few tries but i can usually get it.  My question is this. will it get progressively and quickly worse?  can i drive it for a week or two without getting stranded (as long as i'm willing to tinker with it 'til it runs).?

No way to say for sure, but if you are gentle with it, you can probably get by for a couple of weeks.

&gt;  
&gt;How hard is the snip, add toggle trick?  on which wire would the toggle have to go?  how hard is the ignition switch change in late busses.

It's not terribly difficult, but it is not a ten minute job either.  We can help you with specific questions.  The new switch is available from Busted Bus for about $50.  Yeah, on the steep side but worth it compared to a toggle switch under the dash.
