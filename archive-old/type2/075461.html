&gt; Pristine European painted metal dash for a '73/'74 Bus. In Europe
&gt; the plastic dash was an option all the way upto '79. I think/thought

AFAIK, all US baywindows had padded dashes.

&gt; My dash is beige primered inside out, no dents, scratches or rust.
&gt; the radio hole is enlarged to accept a DIN format radio/casette/CD
&gt; unit. I did this myself and did it very carefully, it's exactly in
&gt; the middle, perfectly straight and smooth edges, it looks factory.

&gt; I would like a pristine '73/'74 plastic covered dash for my single
&gt; cab. No cracks or scratches however small they may be..  I'm not
&gt; trying to be ignorant, but honest, these things tend to keep me
&gt; awake at night :) .. and only holes for the light switch on the
&gt; left, and the hazard switch on the right. Light surface rust on the
&gt; inside is ok.

Hmmm.  You want to trade a metal dash with an enlarged radio hole
(it may be done carefully, but it is still not original) for a
pristine original plastic dash?

I'd say that uncracked plastic dashes of that vintage make hens' teeth
look plentiful!  Perhaps in a museum, but not in a real-world bus!  Also,
I don't think any buses came to the US with fewer than three holes in
them (light switch, wipers, hazards) and probably two or three more
(interior light, defroster, silver socket).
