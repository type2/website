&gt; Original type 4 2 liter engines don't have counterweights. Is that what
you
&gt; really mean, or is it a cast or welded California aftermarket crank?

Maybe I used the wrong verbage.  Not the journal, the solid hunk between the
journals...the 4&quot; thick piece.....

It is not a cast crank.  It is forged VW, standard. not undersized.


&gt;&gt;If you have doubts about what you have, get me a picture. (Or John
Anderson,
he's the best, or Dave Wolfanger).

Not necessary.  I have verified...it is a broken crank. Took it apart
myself.

&gt;&gt;This should NEVER have happened. I'd sure like to know why it did.

You and me both, but hey, it is over and diagnosed now.  Time to build her
better than she was with a set of rebuilt Boston Bob heads and Boston Bob's
cam.

&gt; Adam:
&gt; I've never heard of a type 4 engine breaking a crank. 912 porsches would
&gt; sometimes break them, but the type 4 is a lot beefier. 912 engines were
the
&gt; ultimate developement of the 25-36hp VW. same bore centers, etc. Porsches
&gt; used 36hp cases till 55 with their own heads. 912's had bigger main
bearings
&gt; on the 2nd and 3rd journals and were counter weighted. I think they were a
&gt; little too hard and after a lot of miles, (60kto 100k) often would crack
and
&gt; break.
&gt; If you have doubts about what you have, get me a picture. (Or John
Anderson,
&gt; he's the best, or Dave Wolfanger).
&gt; This should NEVER have happened. I'd sure like to know why it did.
