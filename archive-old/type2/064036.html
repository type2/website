Subject: Re: Lincoln Welder 100 Quests

&gt;       I am looking at the Lincoln model 100 welder for sale ($299) at a local

Nice little unit. Many people on this list cut their teeth welding 
with this unit.

&gt;farm supply story in Iowa. I have never welded in my life but am willing
&gt;to jump in there and become one of the few, the proud, the type 2 home
&gt;restorers. Just wanted to get some advice if I could. I know some list
&gt;members have one and seem satisfied.

I bought my unit about a year ago this month, at Homer De-Poe. I just got
the basic unit, no Gas setup, (It is expensive at HD), and a helmet
(Never weld with the shield that they give you, that is for spectators
to watch through. You NEED both hands.) and some massive gloves.
Set me back about $300 too.

&gt;       Do you have the MIG adapter and how well does it work for most VW bus
&gt;work with or without it? What welding wires do you use? And finally did
&gt;you take any classes or just teach yourself from the video/instructions
&gt;included? Any comments would be much appreciated..

I ust read the instructions, once in the living room, and once with
the welder in my hands. Read every word. (I also get a quick book
from the library, but it didnt really tell me much that the
instructions did not.) I secured a bunch of metal plate and sheet metal,
and just started burning holes through stuff. Expect to waste about
a half a spool of wire just getting the fundamentals down.

After using the flux cored for a while, my wife, saint that she
is, bought me the Gas adaptor. About $79 for the stuff, about $80
for a 40 lb bottle. (Dont get a 20 lb bottle, too small) 

Welding changed forever. With the bottle, the welds actually look better 
than the metal I am welding. It is a little more difficult to keep
a good bead going if you hit even the smallest amount
of rust, paint, oil, old weld slag, bad ground clamp, etc. The
flux cored is still good for metal with trace paint on it,
etc. But, you SHOULD (Wink!) have the metal cleaned and ground down
anyway. 

I still dont consider myself good enough to weld up any exterior
seams yet, I just cant get a smooth bead to lay. I think I need a 
lighter face shield, I have an 11. I think a 9 or 10 grade darkness
would work better. I weld inside. But, for stiching up floor pans,
fender wells, etc. it is the cats meow!

I figured that just to fix the major cancer on the Fastback,
the welder has already paid for its self, based on the estimates
I got. (I live where labor is outrageous) Plus, I can take my time
and make sure that I got all the rust, I can paint behind panels I 
cut out, etc.

Hint: Harbor Freight is your friend. For a good welding cart, if
you dont make your own, get a $29 folding hand-truck that
converts into a little platform truck. Just fits the welder, some 
supplies, the bottle, etc. Carts were $99 in the same catalog, 
and I cant carry stuff with them, if I have to.

Well, enough diatribe for me. 

PS: Where do most people get thier sheet metal panels? All I can find
are 20 gauge 'repair' panels I would punch thorugh with a good sneeze,
or 10 gauge plate, not cutable with snips. Welding suply doesnt have
them, gas place either, metal company in the phone book wont sell
less than 500 lbs of steel.
