Subject: '68-'72 vintage bus interior - best offer

I need to clear some space in my barn, and a friend of mine had some '68 - '72
era bus seats in there that he wants to get rid of. front, middle, and rear, all
the beigeish, off white  basketweave, no rips or tears. I think they were out of
a beige '68 bus. He also has the two-tone brown side &amp; door panels-'68-'71
vintage. .  He also needs to get rid of a bunch of brand new-still have the
stickers on them- 15&quot; tube type tires for '63 and down buses. these would have
been what the buses would have originally come with. 

Best offer on all of the above.
I'm in Allentown, Pa
