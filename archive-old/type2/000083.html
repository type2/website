alt. from 74 rigged on a special homemaid bracket. Pretty interesting. Anyway 
i am putting the right one on now and need help!  What size belt, How does it 
connect?, What size bolts does it connect with?  Also what year tin would fit 
better in this bus with this engine i have been told 75-79? Thanx all! Cliff
