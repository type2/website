Subject: Tropicalization

Hi people, another easy question from Italy...

I was wondering how you have to modify a T2 1600 bus, not FI, to work in
tropical climates and conditions, in particular: Senegal.
I have approximately 5 months to make the necessaries modifications so the
bus can work fine in a 500 Celsius climate, dry; we are planning to get
there by april-may therefore the temps will have risen to that maximum, not
counting dust and sand...

What could be done to immunize a bus? Does anyone knows of people down there
who are happy VWACers?

Thanks people,

Andy
