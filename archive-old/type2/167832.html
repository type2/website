Subject: Re: [T2] The ideal VW motor replacement

Peter Steckhan quoth:

&gt;A two-stroke horizontally opposed 2 cylinder 1810cc diesel engine.  It
&gt;almost looks similar...

	That could assuage the guilt of a T2er who decided to flag 
away the pleasures of keeping the old VW motor going, and had plenty 
spondulicks to invest in high reliability &amp; high fuel economy.

&gt;
&gt;The engine is water-cooled.  The goofy part is the fact is that it's
&gt;got two cylinders, four pistons and two crankshafts.  The crankshafts
&gt;are where you would expect the heads to be (there are no valves or
&gt;camshaft) and compression is achieved by the two pistons meeting in
&gt;the middle of the cylinder.

	This is not novel but a brilliant old idea which lapsed for 
no apparent reason.  I'm glad to see it revived.  Veterans of the 
British Empah will know the old Commer, and badge-engineered Karrier, 
lorries which had the same type of diesel motor.  No cyl head, and 
therefore no cyl head gasket, is a good start ...
We do not have goof-thru!

&gt;  Intake ports are on one end of the
&gt;cylinder, exhaust ports on the other end.

	This 'uniflo' arrangement is also old  -  esp in steam engines.


&gt;
&gt;Avtur/Jet-A1/Kerosene/#1 Fuel Oil/#1 Diesel are similar.  Diesel has a
&gt;lubricant added that Avtur/Jet-A1/Kerosene/#1 Fuel Oil is missing, so
&gt;I would assume there would be greater wear in the fuel system.
&gt;Perhaps the additional wear is not a big deal for an aviation engine
&gt;that needs to be torn down every 1000 hours.

	Those aviation overhaul intervals are of course chosen to 
make it v v unlikely that a plane will run out of motive force.  A 
road vehicle can surely put up with the slight increase in failure 
risk at 2000h, or for all I know 4000h.

thanx Peter
