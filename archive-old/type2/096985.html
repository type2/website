Subject: Camshaft Identification

I bought a camshaft off a list member as I'm gathering parts for a 2.0 solid
lifter rebuild.
I'm trying to determine whether a camshaft is Solid or Hydraulic.
It is NOS in a Blue VW Box still with dry cosmoline on it. The sticker on
the box reads
021 109 021 J   Camshaft G
and the numbers on the camshaft are
021 109 111 B   with  a &quot;zero&quot; on the inner teeth

He and I are both pretty sure it's solid, but can we make that assumption or
should I measure lift
with a caliper and try to compare to known readings from a hydraulic
camshaft? If so, what are the measurable differences?

The question came up because my case is a canadian rebuild designed for a
code CV motor replacement
1980 Vanagon. The cam that came out of that reads 021 109 111 C with a
&quot;zero&quot; on the inner teeth.
I was expecting the ID prefix to begin with 022 since this was originally a
replacement for a hydraulic motor.
On the other hand, maybe all canadian rebuilds had solid setups. I do not
know. Or maybe &quot;021&quot; and &quot;022&quot; no longer
has anything to do with the grind, but for NOS cams 021 always means solid
and 022 means hydraulic?.

Any comments? Thanks.
