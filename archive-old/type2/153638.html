Hello Andy,
   Just a line to say that I have been living in France for the past
thirty years ; so, if I can be of any help to list members needing
European found articles (such as the gas heaters...). Just let me know.
                                                                Yours
truly,

&gt; Twice in the last few years I've received price quotes from Espar
&gt; dealers for the Airtronic gas models.  I have yet to purchase one
though
&gt; no one mentioned anything about their unavailability.  I note these
&gt; dealers specialized in marine products.

&gt; 
&gt; Ban News. My contact tried both Espar and Webasto (both have similar
&gt; gas heaters) and they flatly refuse to export gas heaters to the US
&gt; citing liability.
&gt; 
&gt; They seem to work in other countries just fine, though.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks a lot you friggin' US litigators. Sue happpy S. O. B. s.
&gt; 
&gt; At this point the only way it's gonna happen is if someone outside the
&gt; US buys them and ships them to us.
&gt; 
&gt; Alternately, the diesel versions ARE available. They run just fine on
&gt; kerosene, too. Have to add a tank, though. This really sucks.
&gt; 
&gt; Merry Christmas, everybody! No, I really mean it.
