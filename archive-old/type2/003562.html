I have a 72 westy hard top  in Aiken sc for sale.
It is solid with surface rust but no rot except in the dog legs. It has no
interior or motor  but does have both bumpers(yippe). all doors are solid
and so are rockers. There is small damage on a side panel but has been
pulled and skimmed.. Ithas both front seats and title.
 Also comes with extra ignition switch that has a key.
How does $400 sound for this treasure?
mail me if interested      innes_at_clickcom_dot_com
