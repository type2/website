&gt; hello list!
&gt; 
&gt; well,i finaly got a wiring diagram for type 2 '72(1973-1975 models).  i 
&gt; think i got it from type2's library (i'm not sure, sorry). I have spent a 
&gt; couple of days staring at it, but nothing has come up yet. my e- background 
&gt; sucks, and my bus (montaña) is a spaghetti western indeed.  does anyone have 
&gt; any pointers on how to read (understand) this?        i would like to 
&gt; straighten the mess.

OK, first you need to get good lighting and a comfortable place to read.

Second, the wiring diagram is only &quot;sorta&quot; laid out how your vehicle is
laid out.  It takes some study and comparison to figure out where the
wires _really_ go.

Third, it pays to know what the terminal numbers mean.  There are
references on the net that match the DIN terminal numbers on the switches
and diagrams to the circuits they control.  For example, 56 is the
headlight circuit on any German car be it VW, Mercedes, BMW, etc.

Be patient, study hard and it will come to you!
