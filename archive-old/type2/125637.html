Subject: starting and warm up

Maybe I should be a bit more patient and let it catch on its own. I will
try that and not give it gas to see. Maybe a cold start problem coming
up, good thought. As far as the warm up I usually hear it get its
groove, not sure how long. Just didn't want to put extra wear on it by
letting it idle too long.

Thanks:-)

Peace

Meg
