Subject: [T2] wiper motor and frame

Hi Volks,
   I recently replaced what the Bentley manual refers to as the wiper motor 
and frame.  In essence it's the entire wiper mechanism minus the  dash board 
switch.  Since several people had advised me that it would a bear to get the 
assembly out from under the dash, I thought I'd share what I did, as I had 
no trouble at all.
   The first thing I did was to disconnect the battery just to be safe.  
Then I dropped the wiper switch out of the dash so that I could see and draw 
a map of which wire went on which terminal, and then disconnect them.  Next 
came removing the glove box.  It was a good opportunity to clean it out too. 
  I removed the defroster vents and connecting ducts, both left and right.  
Now I went outside the bus and removed the wiper arms and the nuts with 
washers that hold the shaft into the body.  Finally, there is one bolt at 
the bottom of the wiper motor and frame assembly that holds it to the body 
work, remove it.  Now pull the motor and frame back to get the shafts clear 
of the body, and lower it out from under the dash by going down to the 
right.  Hmm, seems it's caught on something?  There's a ground wire that has 
one end that slips onto a connector on the wiper assembly and the other end 
slips onto a connector on the body, disconnect it.  Now it should slip right 
out.
   While I had the wiper frame out and the vents off I took the opportunity 
to treat some rust, touch up some paint, repair some chaffing wires, and 
clean a spot that may have never been cleaned before under my dash.
   Installation is just the reverse procedure from the removal.  First, use 
new seals for where the shafts go through the body.  Don't forget to consult 
the shop manual for proper placement of the wiper arms.  All in all it was 
quite an easy job.
