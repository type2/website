Subject: Game over?

&quot;cross posted&quot; to several of my favorite vw lists.

81 air cooled vanagon. Dropped the engine to replace a bad head.

Wasted today putting my engine back together. I put the head back on, and
put the valve train stuff into place. Then it was time to make the first
round of adjustments on the valves, so I rotated the engine, at the pulley
bolt, and was not thrilled to find that the engine only rotates part of the
way, and then locks up solid.

After a bout of nausea and disgust, I set about looking. Can't find a thing.
Pulled the head back off, and used my sockets and head bolts combo to keep
the cylinders in place. The engine will not rotate freely. As a reference, I
watch the  number two piston. Its at the top, so I rotate it down to the
bottom and back up to the top, and it locks up hard. Solid. Will not turn.
Guess that is 180 degrees of the crank rotation.

Turn it back around the other way, watch the number two piston for a
reference, and it goes down, comes up, and locks up hard. Not compression
hard. Rock solid hard.

I didn't touch the left side of the motor, still even has all the tin on it,
so with the right head off. I believe I have checked all the stupid things
that could have happened, and I have no clue.

I spent the rest of the afternoon putting it all back together, not torquing
the bolts or anything, as I figure I  gonna shove it back into the van, and
give it a decent burial.
Any chance anyone would care to take a guess as to what happened? Obviously,
it was working before, and at this point, I am unable to comprehend what I
could have done that would lock it up like this.

I thought I was doing good, and would have her back on the road by the end
of the day on Monday. &lt;shrug&gt;

Bummed doesn't begin to describe it....
