&gt;&gt; Where does Grace have a strobe light installed?
&gt;
&gt;rofl,.... how fun would it be to have a party in that bus.  unless
&gt;you were epileptic of course, and then it would really bite.  Maybe
&gt;it's in the dome light.  Or possibly a fog light attatchment?  I
&gt;couldn't see it being part of the head light unless of course you
&gt;were living in the State of Confusion, U.S.A.
&gt;
&gt;I saw a police car with a directional strobe once.  It was military
&gt;police and they were using it to spot a guy that was hiding in some
&gt;tall brush.  The strobe effect made him stand out as he was moving
&gt;from cover to cover, whereas the human eye can't see the movement in
&gt;the dark so easily with a solid beam.  Hmmmm  Volkswagen bus police
&gt;cars in the U.S. in the 21st century? ponder ponder.
&gt;
&gt;On a serious note.  If it is just a standard modular strobe light it
&gt;has everything to do with the manufacturer as _some_ strobes are gas
&gt;injected and actually require boxed disposal because even an inert
&gt;bulb has high pressure gas in it.  Some units can have a bulb
&gt;swopped out, but they are high end and usually for light shows,
&gt;etc..  The small ones for your house that are found at Radio Shack
&gt;are disposable.  If you have one of those, it's a fixed unit.
