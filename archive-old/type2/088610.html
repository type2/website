Subject: Frozen Brakes!??

Volks,

Last night I installed my new tail light assemblies (ref previous
post), so there was a fair amount
of running up to the cab and depressing the brake pedal to check
for lights.

Today, I needed to move the Bus from its spot in the garage so I
could access the attic... won't move!
I've seen sparing references to frozen brakes, but a search of
the archive only addressed cold weather
issues - and it certainly ain't cold here in GA!  Nonetheless, I
did some rocking F/B in 1st and Reverse=
no luck.  I didn't push it for fear of damaging things.  It seems
to be only in the back wheels.  My parking
brake seems fine as the handle engages and retracts normally.

What's the likely culprit here? What do I do about it?

Thanks!
