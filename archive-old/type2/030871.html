&gt; This is a well-known problem with an equally well-known fix.
&gt; The fix involves adding a starter relay, and it is fully

&gt; In a pinch you can crawl under the bus and use a nickle
&gt; or a quarter to start it by shorting from the battery terminal

DON'T forget to put it in neutral or park and set the hand brake!!!


I put a switch in my engine compartment that connects the two terminals so
that rather than crawl under the bus I just reach inside and push, but the
real advantage is when I am tuning it up or working on it, I can &quot;Bump&quot;
the engine from the rear, or restart it if it stalls while working on it.

if the ignition switch is off it still won't start but it will crank
if the ignition switch is on it will start (hopefully)

never realized how much running from the rear to the front I was doing
until I stopped
