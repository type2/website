&gt;&gt;It would have to be engineered, or fabricated and trial and errored to
&gt;&gt;death. The 1.7L never was delivered with FI. Then, of course, it wouldn't
&gt;&gt;be stock, where the highest value to the most is found. Why?? Cause it's
&gt;&gt;easy to make stock work right.

&gt;your Bus. It would not be stock, 

Exactly!! If I were negotiating for a 411/412 in a Type 2, it would be
discounted considerably. The further from stock, the less value, in any
knowledgeable mind, for a street VW.
