Adam asked:
&gt;Anyone on the list have any good Internet Sites on
Electric Motors...I am considering this option down
the way...just interested to what is out 
there.

Check out Home Power magazine,
http://www.homepower_dot_com
I think the lead article on their website, from the
recent issue of the magazine, is about solar charging
a vehicle, and if you go to &quot;solar links&quot; on the home
page, you will find links to electric vehicle
organizations, etc.  I think there are links to other
electric vehicle sites, too, and they have a column in
the magazine on electrice vehicles every issue.  There
are a couple of good books on the subject available,
too, but they are at home so I can't give you the info
at the moment.
