Brad Herring sends:

&gt; Ok all,
&gt; I removed the dizzy and found that the shaft had two small o rings. I
&gt; looked in Bentley and found that there should be a &quot;single O ring&quot;. So now I
&gt; know why its leaking oil and that I will never take the bus back to the shop
&gt; who fixed it. Now I was wondering where I can pick up one of these O rings?
&gt; Any info will not be turned away.

Brad (and all): 

This O ring is in the engine seal kit. Everyone should have one of these;
they come in very handy.
