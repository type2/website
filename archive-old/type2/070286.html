&gt;Muir, and the official VW book, dont say yes or 
&gt;no to needing to bleed the brake system after replaceing the 
&gt;brakelight switches..

David, Let's look at the reason(s) why we bleed the brakes and what are 
the symptoms when it is needed:
1. Air in the system. Just a tiny bubble of air will make the pedal 
feel spongy. 
2. How did it get there?  Usually on account of a slow leak in the 
fluid system and the reservoir became depleted after repeated strokes 
of the mastercylinder piston. (normal operation) At this point the 
master cylinder has no source of fluid and instead pumps a small amount 
of air it got from the empty reservoir.

Now, to answer your question.  If you replaced the brake lite switch 
quickly and nobody pressed on the brake pedal, you most likely didn't 
get any air into the system.  If you did, then after replacing the 
switch, the pedal would feel spongy and have little force on the wheel 
cylinders and poor braking action.

Trick: if the switch is at the rear of the master cylinder, then when 
replacing the switch as the new one is threaded into place, reach up 
and gently pull down on the brake pedal linkage to cause some fluid 
(and trapped air) to bleed around the loose threads of the switch. Do 
not release pressure on the pedal linkage until the switch is tight.

None of the above applies when the brake light switch is not associated 
with the brake hydraulic system but rather a mechanical switch on the 
pedal linkage.
