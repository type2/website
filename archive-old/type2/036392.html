Subject: _at_#!%*&amp;!!!! shifter adjustment

ok, so this was supposed to be simple- just replace the shift coupler...i 
did it on my ghia and it was a bit of a pain, but then the access hole is 
only slightly larger than my hands, so it was more of an exercise in 
frustration...the bus was supposed to be easier- the things just hangin 
there out in the open, right? nope...i wont bore you with the troubles i had 
with it though...at least its in and i dont have to lay upside down on the 
parking lot any more :)

the trouble now is that i cant get my shifter installed correctly  (doing 
this at night by light of a mini maglight, i shouldnt expect anything but 
trouble...but i need this on the road by sat.) but i cant get the base plate 
and the fulcrum part and all else lined up correctly the way the bentley 
says... any tips on puttin this mess back together correctly?? (as it 
stands, im fine as long as i only need 1st gear...and if im lucky, reverse) 
playing hide-and-go-seek-gears is no fun!! :(
