Subject: anybody need type1 heaters?

Hi

I've got that hideous mess of a custom-type4-exhaust-made-of-type1-parts
off my bus, anybody need the parts? ..only thing that's useable is the
heaters really. they're welded at the heater/muffler connection, but
judging by the quality of the other welds that broke apart when it hit
the ground, it shouldn't be much of a problem ;-)

they're free if you want to come get them, or I'll ship them if you want
me to... I'm near Chicago...

I passed emissions too!
