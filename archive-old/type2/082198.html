Subject: Re: [T2] Penetrol info

Paul,

Look at the frontof the can---

The first thing it mention's is fiberglass ----

I just got done with the pop top roof, on my 87 Westy--it's maroon, and
was chaulked ot on the top ----a lttle fading on the side's----

As I look out my window, as I'm writing--no discoloration on the top at
all---

I found this stuff a Marine ships store years ago, when I just had
purchased a faded 22 ft. cuudy cabin boat---

I wiped it all down with the Penetrol--and it looked good all boating
season---

Don't go just slopping it on real heavy either---just wipe a litte at a
time, and buff it up with another rag---if it needs more---just go over
it again with some more--and buff a little again.

It took me all of 30 minutes to get the whole job done--

You'll be real happy with this product---

Be sure you clean the top real good prior to application----

Have Fun---
