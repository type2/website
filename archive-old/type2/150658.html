&amp;gt; I have been using hylomar for sealing valve covers for several years and
&amp;gt; it has worked well for me. The only caveat is that it is not supposed to
&amp;gt; be stored at a temperature of over 100 degrees F.

&amp;gt; Has anyone noticed any changes in the stuff after storing at a very high
&amp;gt; temp?

I routinely leave my tube of hylomar in my bus through SoCal summers.  I
never noted any change in the stuff.  In fact, I've never heard of any
storage requirement, but then again it might have crept into the fine
print.
