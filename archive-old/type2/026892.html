Subject: replacing the fuel filler neck, ever done this?

Hello listmembers,

I am just about through with rolling down my windows every time I take a 
sharp turn full a full tank of gas. That smell is driving me crazy.

I have been bugging my mechanic to replace the fuel filler neck forever now, 
and he is seemingly always to backed up and our schedules never jive, which 
is important since the bus is my daily driver.

Im now thinking about the days off I have coming up, and figure I may as 
well attack this myself. But, what is involved in this?
My Haynes doesn't really give any details on this area of the bus, and what 
im getting myself into. When I take the gas cap off, I can see those 4 
screws that hold the neck in place, but im curious how this fits over the 
rest of the fuel neck thingy. Am I going to have to get into this area 
another way, or can I just pull it off from the outside of the bus and slip 
the new one over it?

I see that little circle thing behind the airbox, and im guessing that is 
some kind of access to that area, but I dont want to go pulling anything out 
of there until I know for sure how big of a hole im digging here.


on the other hand, if you are in the Bay Area and have any experience with 
this, i'll bring the Red Stripe. =)


Thanks for any tips or hints you can throw my way!
