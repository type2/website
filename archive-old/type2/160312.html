Yet another reason I won't be moving there anytime soon.  (Another is named Pelosi.)  But I must admit, even with the immoderate degeneracy, San Francisco is one of the most beautiful cities in the world.  And I've seen a bunch of them.  Nice place to visit, wouldn't wanna...yeah, like New Orleans.  Before the flood. Ah, the stories I can tell around the campfire on that one.   

&quot;Cal emissions refugee&quot;  ROFL!  I passed the proctologist.  Ouch!  

Say, when are you gonna come and get that door?  I realize now that I have both doors.  But only the passenger door has a good window slider.  Cheers...KR

NO.  Right off the bat you are lacking the stock engine setup for your
year regardless of your numbers.

Can you pass the gascap breather test?  Timed per manufacturers' specs?  Dyno?

Then there's the proctologist.
