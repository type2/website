Subject: Pilot Bearing??

What would be a good way to tell if the Pilot Bearing is gone on your 
tranny? I have an intermittent problem with my bus that tends to only happen 
in 1st or reverse. It's not the clutch because it shifts fine through all 
the gears and dosn't make any noise while driving. What kind of noises does 
it make when the shaft from the tranny dosn't line up right with the engine? 
I have noises that kinda sounds like something is slipping and I can feel a 
significant amount of pressure and griding on the clutch pedal when this 
noise happens. I have been trying to get it to make these noises again the 
last few days but havn't had any luck. What will happen if this isn't taken 
care of immediatly? I havn't been driving it cause I'm not sure I trust it 
right now until I have a look to identify the problem. What kinda warning 
signs does it usually give before it goes, cause I didn't really get 
any(unless I just wasn't paying close enough attention). It was fine one day 
and doing this the next, so I'm not sure what to think.

TIA,
