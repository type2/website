    I have a question...?

    Has anyone looked at the manifold for a Beetle semi-automatic...??

    it seems to me it has a fairly large tube welded on just below the
carb flange... maybe a possible solution...

    I'd check but I got rid of all my Slush-o-matic stuff over the
summer.

    Just glad my '73 Westy is fully automatic &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;

        Take care...
