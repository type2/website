Subject: More starter problems

OK, I found the ground and attached it.  Now the
cylinoid clicks really hard but the starter motor
isn't doing anything.  When I try the screwdriver
method it clicks multiple times but the starter never
seems to engage and try to turn the engine.  Thinking
back, the starter worked when I pulled the engine but
the last two miles I was driving through the city with
the pilot bearing gone and had to start the bus in 1st
gear a couple of times before getting it home.  do I
have a blown starter motor?  I'm thinking I must of
killed it with those in gear starts.
