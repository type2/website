Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Progressive carb on `77 BUS

I have solved the no heat riser problem with a progressive, it cost 80
bucks........

I'm a progressive hater, however they are sometimes the only economical
choice..

&gt; I know lots'o folks on the list have had bad luck or just plain hate the
&gt; Weber Progressive setup.
&gt;
&gt; Not me! I ran one on my '77 Westy for 4 years without a problem. Power and
&gt; mileage were very close to what I got with FI. There may be different
&gt; versions of the carb because some people suggest that there is not place
to
&gt; hook up a vac dizzy hose. I ran mine with the stock dizzy without any
&gt; issues. Don't use a 009 on a 2L engine - it does NOT give enough advance.
&gt; The installation took about 2 hours and away I went. Installation on an FI
&gt; bus is quite simple because the throttle cable already comes out right
where
&gt; you want it. The only Rube-Goldberg in my setup was an extension I added
to
&gt; the throttle cable to reach the carb. I don't know what jet sizes I was
&gt; using - whatever came installed in the carb - I believe it came with a set
&gt; of high altitude jets as well.
&gt;
&gt; Cold weather may cause carb icing - there is no heat riser. This could be
a
&gt; big issue. I only run my bus in the 'better' half of the year so it was
not
&gt; an issue with me.
&gt;
&gt; I've since put FI back on my bus and of course I love the drivability vs.
a
&gt; carb. But the Weber worked great for me for 4 years. There - that's my 2
&gt; cents worth. Good Luck!

&gt; &gt;Hello, I just picked up a very nive `77 westfalia.
&gt; &gt;The fuel injection is dead.  Came with a new
&gt; &gt;Progressive weber carb kit new in the box.  I have it
&gt; &gt;on the van and ready to go.
