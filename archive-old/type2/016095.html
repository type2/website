Hi David,

What year Bus you talking about... a Type1 engine?

Which manual are you following?

If type1 ... I've found you have a couple options  1) you can drop the
support bar and jack the engine up under oil drain plate... then put the
support bar on.  Depends on the style of muffler you have if you can do
this, but I've done it when my bolts needed replacing on my support bar.  2)
There really shouldn't be any reason why you can't remove the heat exchanger
while the support bar is in place.  As long as you clear the heat tubes out
of the way, as you have to move the heat exchanger toward front (FIF) to get
it past two studs..

Hope this helps.

Volks,
  My manual said install left heat exchanger then install engine bearer , 
well i did now i cant get the bearer on the stud, is there some trick I look

at this and wonder why you have to install the exchanger first it makes no 
sense , but i cant get the rubber mount stud bolt thru the hole in the 
bearer. Am i misssing something?

  David
