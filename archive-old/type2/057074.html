Howdy.

I have a '71 bus that is giving me some electrical problems.

1)  Whenever I put the parking lights on, the fuel gauge pegs to max.
2)  The left turn signal blinks fast, even though both bulbs are good.
3)  All 4 side marker lights don't come on.  Shouldn't they come on with
parking, normal, and brights?
4) PO disconnected the brake master cylinder warning light.  I have only the
brown center wire identified.  Anyone able to tell me which colored wires I
need to find disconnected for the other two connectors?

I have disassembled the front gauge cluster and even swapped it out with a
'70 that I had.  ((Identical)).  No difference.  I also replaced the left
rear turn signal / brake light housing ... as I knew it had some bad
grounding.  However, I still get fast blink on left turn signal.

As you know, there are two &quot;lights on&quot; indicators on the lower of the fuel
gauge.  I think I figured out that one says &quot;parking on&quot; the other indicates
&quot;brights on.&quot;  I find that if  disconnect this lead, the fuel gauge does NOT
get screwed up when parking lights are turned on... and parking lights still
work!

So I thought there must be some place to check to try down how the fuel
gauge line is tied to the lights being turned on!  Anyone tracked this one
down?

Any clue on why all 4 side markers don't work -- yet all the 4 normal
parking lights work?
