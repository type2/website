It seems to me that either way your looking at between a couple of weeks and 
a couple of months.  Now you can buy an engine from APV, but your still 
going to have to remove and dismantle your engine--right down to the core.  
Then you have to mantle the engine (with new gaskets, etc.) and install it, 
tune it, etc.  Since this is your first time, it will take a couple of days, 
probably more, since you will forget some part and have to wait an extra 
week while it is on order.  Not something to want to attempt in a parking 
lot. You can, of course, attempt this in a parking lot; don't let me 
dissuade you.

Problem: You need (1)transportation while your bus gets fixed and (2) some 
place to work on your bus.

Simple solution (2 steps):

1) Buy another VW bus (thing or beetle) that runs at least well enough to 
get you by for 2 months.

2) Rent a mini-storage with electricity that you can access at night and 
work on your bus there.

Step 1 should cost about $700 and step 2 should cost under $100. A few 
dollars to be sure, but that's still less than you would pay the mechanic to 
do the rebuild and rent a car. The best part is, when you get done with the 
engine replacement, you can sell the substitute bus (thing or beetle) you 
bought (after a good tune-up) for $725. ;-)

But, of course, the substitute bus (thing or beetle) you buy totally breaks 
down after a week.  So, you buy a third substitute bus (thing or beetle), 
rent a second mini-storage, etc. and so on....  humm, maybe this isn't such 
a good idea after all.  Just forget all that, sorry, bad idea.

good luck,

Brian
