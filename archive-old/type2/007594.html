I guess David and I are the only ones that think
this may be reasonable. When I first started looking
for a Westy, I found several rust buckets (Oh, they
had 200 lbs of bondo, of course, sellers always told
me they were &quot;rust-free&quot;) wheezing oil-soaked engines
, and trashed interiors. They all wanted between 3
3.5K!! I ended up buying the &quot;best&quot; one I could find
here in Virginia, a '76 with a carbed engine. It 
was far from perfect, but at least the seller was
honest about it's condition. This was two years ago,
and if I added up all the receipts I've got for
parts, including a paint gun and compressor and a
mig welder,plus all the hours I've worked on it, plus
purchase price, I'm probably over 10K at this point.
In March of '96, while in Phoenix on business, I
found a near showroom condition '79 Deluxe for sale
for 5K. I could kick myself in the ass for not
buying it. I once bought a fully restored '67 Mustang
for 7K. The seller gave me all the receipts for the 
restoration on this car, and they totaled over 18K.
If this Westy is has been professionally restored,
no bondo or other BS, 10.5 may not be out of line.
After all, go price a new Eurovan, or any camper
conversion based on a Ford/Chevy/Dodge van. Expect
to spend 45K minimum.         Jeff S.
