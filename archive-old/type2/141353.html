Subject: Re: [T2] Headlight aimers??

From: &quot;courtney hook&quot; &lt;courtneyhook_at_shaw_dot_ca&gt;
&gt; Thanks Mike! It appears to be a level system, with 3 mounting points for
the headlight rim. Do you by any chance have the instruction sheet that goes
with it?

The instructions are printed in raised relief on the back of the unit.  You
can see them (upside down) in one of the pictures, #3 I think.

I could try another picture with the light at a different angle, if you need
to read them.
