OOOH!  possible &quot;BOOM&quot; here.  That shopvac motor will make sparks, and the
air it blows in will carry vapors back to the vacuum.  Not a good idea at
all unless you put the vacuum a _long_ way from the bus!

As far as flushing goes, if you have an early bus you can remove the fuel
strainer which will leave a sizeable hole at the bottom of the tank.
Syphon as much gas out of the tank as you can before you pull the screen
and have a bucket handy.  Needless to say, be very careful of sparks and
other sources of ignition.

Once you get the screen out, you can then rinse the tank with water.  Just
let it flow from the open outlet.  You might make a 90 degree fitting
for the hose end so that you can spray the entire inside of the tank. Hot
water is even better than cold, as it dissolves sugar faster.

Of course, once you get the tank rinsed, you need to dry it completely
before putting gas back in.  Even then, put a bottle of &quot;gas drier&quot; into
the first tank of gas.

Not as perfect a solution as removing the tank for cleaning, but a whole
lot easier!  If you use care, it should work fine.
