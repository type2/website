Subject: Re: [T2] Starting troubles in San Diego

Hi PM,

DON'T PANIC!

The engine stops spinning after 90 degrees when you turn the fanbelt  
because you're running into a compression stroke. If you tighten the  
fanbelt by pushing it inwards you will probably find that the engine  
will spin past the compression stroke and will do the same thing  
another 90 degrees later. If it still won't turn then pull all 4  
spark plugs and try again.

Testing the 1972 starter requires a support for the armature, unless  
you have converted to the 73-79 Auto-tranny starter. The most  
commonly available support for this is a 1968-75 bell housing.  
Without that support there is no way to properly test the starter.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; First, thanks for the responses.

&gt; After todays adventures, I am left knowing two things. 1 Kragen  
&gt; does not have the ability to properly test the unit it sold me. and  
&gt; 2 I don't think the Starter/Solenoid is the issue.
&gt;
&gt; I'll skip the frustrating part of my day and get to the point.   
&gt; With a new rebuilt replacement Starter/Solenoid (whichs  
&gt; theoretically works properly) Sunshine still won't start.  Ok.  So  
&gt; it has to be something else.  Back to the computer to check for  
&gt; responses from you guys.
&gt;
&gt; Two things stand out.  1 Go back to the start.  The issue began  
&gt; with the engine stopping.  2 Is the engine spinning freely?
&gt;
&gt; So I go back out.  I double check the stick shift, run it through  
&gt; the gears and back to neutral.  I grab a wrench, put it on the  
&gt; Alternator Pulley and try to hand turn the engine.  The Alternator  
&gt; pulley slips under the fan belt (I suppose I could tighten that up  
&gt; but not the point) otherwise nothing moves.  I go the other  
&gt; direction and everything turns normally, fan belt does not slip,  
&gt; but I can't go very far before it tightens up.Back in the original  
&gt; direction, free at first then tight where it was before I started.   
&gt; So The ENGINE IS NOT SPINNING FREELY.  Crap!  We've just crossed  
&gt; into an area where I know nearly nothing.  Bolt on/Plug in part I'm  
&gt; good with; Internal engine stuff not so much.
&gt;
&gt; So can someone break it to me gently?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks again
