Subject: Re: [T2] brake question

Bob, 

Thanks for the input. I did get the retaining pins out. (Those that hold the 
pads in that had to be removed according to my book before the calipers will 
come out.) 
I think, meanwhile, I have found someone who can rebuild my calipers. I 
wonder however if it is OK to leave them off of the metal lines a few days 
while I have this done.  Should be OK, shouldn't it? 
I do have a replacement master cylinder, and figured I'd go ahead and install 
that after I got all the new lines on the brakes and the calipers working 
correctly and installed. The I'd start the brake bleed at the MC then at each 
wheel. Is this OK? 

Again, thanks for the input. Good luck getting your parts. I ordered from Bus 
Depot on a Monday and had the parts Thursday afternoon. Guess I lucked out.
