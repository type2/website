Do a quick compression check, black smoke is a sign of fuel probems, not
engine problems.  If the compression is within 30% of each other and none
are below 100 psi, you still have some life in the engine, but need to
figure out the fuel problem.  Excessive fuel can wash the oil off the
cylinder walls which will make the rings wear faster.

If it's in nice, or just OK shape, and the compression looks good, offer
them $1200 and see what they say.


&gt;Hi folks!
&gt;
&gt;I am going to look at a 75 Westy Weekender tomorrow night.  It is a non-pop
&gt;top, from what I have been told, this is the definition of a Westy
&gt;Weekender.  Is this corect?
&gt;
&gt;Here's the scoop on it.  Original paint, a little faded but no rust.  All
&gt;original interior in great shape, with exception of driver's seat that has a
&gt;couple of tears.  Recently did some work - new brakes and shocks all around,
&gt;clutch cable, etc.
&gt;
&gt;Problem - engine is blowing black smoke, so some type of significant engine
&gt;problem coming on.
&gt;
&gt;Not sure of mileage.
&gt;
&gt;So the big question - how much is something like this worth?
&gt;
&gt;The car is located in Colorado.
&gt;
&gt;Thanx for your help!
