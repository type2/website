&gt; Thanks, but where on the block will I find this code.
&gt; I am used to working on my 1600 from a beetle.
&gt; I know its not a 1600 bc the starter, points and condeser are all 
&gt; different.

You kinda have to stick your head into the engine compartment, and look 
just where the fan shroud connects to the engine block.  You'll see the 
little &quot;tower&quot; where the oil breather snaps on to the engine.  Right at 
the base of that &quot;tower&quot; is a flat spot where you will find the block's 
engine code stamped.
