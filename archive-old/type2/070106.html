&gt; I have a '64 crew cab and the first line of Id plate reads:

&gt; 29 0

&gt; The VIN is 265050543. Does this mean my car was made on 10.29.64?

That would appear accurate.  VIN 255.042.xxx was made 10/13/64
                         and VIN 215.067.xxx was made 11/30/64

according to my records, so yours fits right in.  Except...I
would consider your crew cab a '65 model, not a '64 model,
according to the third digit in your VIN.  The '64 models had a
7-digit sequential VIN that started with &quot;1&quot;.
