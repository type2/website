I found this bus and brought it home a couple weeks ago.  The PO had it
sitting under a shelter and had been since her dad died a few years ago.

In doing some checking I have figured out that that gas tank is in need of
cleaning or changing.  Apparently the old gas has turned to varnish.

The engine does run, (we trickled fuel into the carb and it started first
try).  We then connected a bottle of gas to it and it sounded even better.

The canvas needs replacing but the interior is in good shape and all there.

The glass is all good and as far as I can tell there are no cracks.

The paint is faded but the body is straight and solid with only minor rust
to contend with.

It needs tires and a good washing.

I am asking $1500 OBO.  This is a good bus that would not take much to put
on the road.

The bus is located in southeast Georgia.
