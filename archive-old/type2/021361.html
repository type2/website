Jake:
Maybe you didn't catch it in his code and ASCI has no DEGREES symbol, but what
was there was WOG (Without Guesswork) 70 c (70 degrees Celsius). Oil temperature
no doubt.158 degrees Fahrenheit. What planet are they on? (Maybe just passing
thru 158 on their way to operating temperature?)
This is NOT QUITE what this thread has been about, which was hot IDLE oil
pressure. My engine does not idle at 2800, (except for the ***damned waerboxer
when the idle stabilizer is on the fritz!)
Please understand, I'm on your side on this. It's somewhere in the realm of
unreasonable expectations for a customer to want a guarantee of a SPECIFIC lbs
pressure at idle. I don't even mind if the damn lite winks at me while idling
slowly when it's really hot. Nice to know the lite works. Yeah, I know we're
supposed to verify it comes on as we begin to crank, but does every one do this?
It should be a drill!!
AND, this is basically in line with what you said &quot;hot oil&quot;. 158 F is pretty
damn cool oil!
