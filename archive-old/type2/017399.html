&gt; 
&gt; Has anybody seen under-dash parcel trays for loafs?  Just saw some on a
&gt; friend's bus the other day, two pieces (one left, one right) looks like
&gt; aluminum, painted black with a woven netting of some sort.  Are these
&gt; rare?  Worth anything?  Anybody know who makes/made 'em?  I want some.
&gt; Thanks for any help,

I have the ones from RMMW.  I personally think they are rather nice. 
Not original by any stretch of the imagination, but nice, and relatively
easy to install nonetheless.  They have a rubber bumper that runs around
the outside, and nylon netting stretched accross.  They will require
that you drill a couple of holes for bolts, so use some form of rust
preventation around the holes.

Just my $.02.

Cheers,
