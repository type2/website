&gt; Yes--they charge quite differently.  Gel cells need a better
&gt; regulation/charging system than &quot;regular&quot; lead acid batteries, and would
&gt; probably be destroyed, or at least their life significantly shortened, if used
&gt; in an automobile with a common voltage regulator.  If you used one as a second
&gt; battery in you VW bus, to power radio, etc., and not as a regular vehicle
&gt; starting battery, and if you had a more sophisticated regulator for the gel
&gt; cell battery, it could work well.  I don't thinnk it is worth the extra
&gt; expense for both battery and charging regulator to use a gel cell in this
&gt; situation.  Of course, if a company comes out with a gel cell intended for
&gt; automotive starting and running use, that is a different situation.

Miatas use a gelcell instead of a regular lead-acid battery, but Miatas are
a horse of a whole 'nother color.
