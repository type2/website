Subject: Re: [T2] Re: California smog revision, vary un-cuth questions

&gt; I'm not suggesting that you migrate east, but someplace with
laws that don't conflict with your love of VW's.

People I know that are politically saavy say that for places with better 
laws, many Californians are moving to Montana, Utah, Colorado, and Arizona.
