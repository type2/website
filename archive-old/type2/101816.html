Subject: Re: [T2] Just got a no seatbelt ticket... has there been a
  study done   saying that belts in a bus would do nothing to prevent
  injury?

You were pulled for speeding not for and not for celebrating the 
First Amendment to the Constitution! After all , this is good ol' US 
of A, right? Right :)

  The cop cut you a deal when he wrote you the ticket for 9 over the 
speed limit. Usually you can get that reduced or tossed if you pay a 
lawyer to represent you. The $200 for legal rep. is a lot cheaper 
than your insurance increase of the next three years.

In North Carolina the police have given up on pulling people for not 
wearing seatbelts. The are bigger fish to fry and the courts are 
clogged up as it is. However, it makes a nice add on kind of like, 
&quot;Would you like fries with that?&quot;

I have gotten slack about wearing mine but after reading the 
responses to your post I think we would both do well to buckle up 
regularly.

Thanks

&gt;Hey folks,
&gt;Yep, just got pulled over. The anti Bush jokes on the
&gt;bumper musta rubbed a raw nerve in someone.
&gt;I was ticketed for going 44 in a 35 and for not
&gt;wearing a seatbelt.
