Subject: Heaters?
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hello,
      I have one of those big bulky heaters under my
dash.  I was told that is was a gas heater.  It does
not work and the hose is cut under the bus.  To say
the least, I don't really like it.  I don't know how
to fix it or what is wrong with it.  Are there any
other type of heater that I could instal in my 77
westy?  I would like one with good heat, but am open
to anything.  I don't like the under the dash kind
though.  Thanks a lot for your help.

Peace,
Tim
