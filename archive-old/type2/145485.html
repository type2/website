&gt; Actually &quot;Worm &amp; Peg&quot; Steering Boxes are what was originally installed on

&gt; modifying is needed I believe.  Upgrading to the later Pittman Arm is one
&gt; thing you have to do (the output shaft is larger).

No, the later box uses different mounting holes and the &quot;neck&quot; is larger,
so it won't fit on an early Bay.  This has been discussed before and the
consensus is that modifying to allow use of a later box is prohibative.

Makes me be very gentle to my existing box!
