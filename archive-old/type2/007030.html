&gt; Hi All,
...Having an intermittant problem with the brake light warning light (little
red one on the dash) on my '69.  It comes on about half the time when the
turn signal is on (doesn't blink though, steady glow), and goes OUT when the
brake pedal is depressed.  Initially thought it was brake related and
replaced both of the brake light warning switches, to no avail. 

&gt; Does anyone know how these two are wired/related?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Wilson  
&gt; '69 Westy
