&lt;&lt; Oddly, new &quot;antique&quot; airplanes are often built with the manufacurers data
plate as the only original part.  The difference between fraud and legal
restoration is often the money involved.

There was an interesting legal decision about that some years ago. A car
collector paid a handsome (more than the $16,000 Bus) price for a fam-
ous Bentley race car...Old Number One, I believe. Trouble was, there wasn't
a single original piece on the car. It had gone through any number of re-
builds and modifications throughout its long life. The present owner sued
such that the car he bought couldn't be the one that was represented by
the seller. The court, however, reviewed all the historical data, and de-
cided that since each transformation was recorded, the vehicle or at
least the idea of the vehicle was the same...
