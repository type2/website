&gt;Greetings Fellow VW People!
&gt;
&gt;I am still contemplating purchasing a side tent for my Westfalia.  The one I
&gt;am considering is perfect.  It has the original bags (nice and clean),
&gt;poles, etc.  It even has the original instructions to go with it.
&gt;
&gt;Here's my dilemma.  For those of you that have these nice options on your
&gt;Westfalias, are they worth it?  Are they something that you would use a lot?
&gt;Or are they more trouble than they are worth?
&gt;
&gt;I'm thinking that they make a wonderful room to get you OUT of the bus when
&gt;camping.  I mean let's face it, there's only so much usable room in a
&gt;Westfalia.
&gt;
&gt;Please let me know what you think.
&gt;
&gt;Also, what is a reasonable price for a perfect tent?  I have never seen one
&gt;that is so clean and complete.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Victor
&gt;

Victor,  I don't have a tent or a gas heater for my 70 Westy.  Doesn't
mean I wouldn't like to have em.  I feel quite lucky to find an orig.
condtion Westy in this age of customization, uncaring owners and the 
effects of time.  Hey, mine had the childs cot, upper bunk and the inner
jaluosie window trim. :)   No cool epoxy shift knob though.  :(

Of course, as with anything (and I've heard this on the list),  a 
'reasonable' price is whatever somebody is willing to pay.  But if it 
will help you out,  I saw on Eb*y several months ago, a mint drive a 
way tent sell for $400.-$425. Didn't have the orig. bag.  I think.

To rich for my blood.   Then again, you never know.....
