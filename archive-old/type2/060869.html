Subject: Re: Book: Plans and instructions for Volkswagen van camper

&gt;Plans and instructions for Volkswagen van camper
&gt;by Clinton R. Hull, published by Trail-R-Club of AMerica, 1976. It's 
&gt;classified as a &quot;trade paperback.&quot;

&gt;I've found it for about $28 in &quot;nearly good condition.&quot; You know all I 
&gt;know now, except where it is.

Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but this book would be a bargain at 
$2.80. Clinton R. Hull did 1/2 dozen or so of these -- how to build a 
trailer, how to build a truck camper. It's 2 X 2 and 1 X 2 framing 
covered by cheaping paneling.

I drove some distance to have a look at this in a library and was pretty 
disappointed in the technical details, though it is of some historical 
interest.

What would be worth $28 would be a pattern book of measured drawings of 
various Westy, Sportsmobile, Riviera, and Sundial cabinets, showing 
joints, direction of woodgrain, and with discussion about how to match 
stains. But that book hasn't been written.
