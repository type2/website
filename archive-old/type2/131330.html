Subject: '78 Windshield Seal

I just had my windshield on my 78 Westy replaced in Virginia.  Heres what 
they charged my insurance company; Windshield $178.35, labor - $40, and 
weather-strip (seal) - $62.15.
The windshield seal is from a company named Precision Replacement Parts 
Corp, Part No WBL 210, Model Weather-strip W/O Tri, Description EE6A  
39-8193, Made in Thailand.

So thatswhere I was going, this windshield seal was made in Thailand.  I 
just thought you wanted to know.
