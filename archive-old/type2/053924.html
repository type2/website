this is probably the only way to get it right

&gt; are the boundary CO readings that will give me the best milage without
&gt; running the engine too lean?  I don't know if it's possible, but can you
&gt; burn-up/overheat your engine if it's overly lean?

yes you can burn it up if you run it too lean.  they were only getting
16-18 stock so don't expect miracles

&gt; Also, has anyone tried using a K&amp;N airfilter on their intakes?  I was
&gt; reading a site linked off of TYPE2.COM and it mentioned that a K&amp;N
&gt; filters gives much better airflow than the stock filter.  Any words on
&gt; this?

as far as I know they are only for the type I engines

&gt; Lastly, it was also mentioned somewhere that the AFM is a restriction to
&gt; airflow because of the flap.  Has anyone ever tried drilling holes in
&gt; the flap and reducing the spring tension?  Just a thought...

the fiddling it would take to make it work right is mind boggling, the
restrictions are not enough to worry about.  There's about 1,000 other
easier things that would get you more fuel milage.  Heck I have a canoe on
my roof and I found I get about a half MPG better gas milage with it
there than not, better aerodynamics ????? who knows but the canoe is
cheaper and more fun than fiddling with the AFM and you probably get more
improvement with the canoe
