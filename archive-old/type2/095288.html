Subject: Re: [T2] Buying a bus for the first time...

&gt;&gt;The bus in particular I'm looking at is a '71 with a 1600cc engine. no

Excellent choice.  I bought my first bus in mid-May and I got a 71. '71 is 
one of the best years in my opionion because it's the last year with the 
Type 1 Engine and the first year with disk brakes.

The Type 1 Engine is easier to work on than the dual carbed or fuel 
injection engines and parts are cheaper from my experience so far. A big 
drawback though is that the bus is underpowered and especially if you have a 
Westy like my bus.

If the brakes feel great then the booster is working, if you have to really 
push hard on the brakes than the booster is probably bad. (My booster is bad 
and i'm still working on getting a replacement).

Be sure and read the Muir book about buying a bus, there's alot of great 
suggestions. Basically go over everything and if you know a bus person try 
to get them to look at the bus for you so you can get an idea of what 
condition it's in.

Post any questions you might have and good luck.
