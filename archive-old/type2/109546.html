Subject: Proposed Eastern Washington bus gathering

List members,

I am tentativley planning a bus gathering in the Spokane, Washington area for
the weekend of September 13th.  Details are still sketchy as to where it will
be.  I was wondering how many of you fine bus drivers might consider
attending?  I have cross posted this to the vintage bus list as well.   It's
nice to be back in the bus scene after a short break.  My '73 bay suffered an
emablism (much gas in the engine, very bad)  and I know am the proud owner of
a '58 panel.
