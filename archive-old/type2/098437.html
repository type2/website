Subject: Re: [T2] Heater

in the summer i wear birkenstocks, so my feet might as well be bare. when
i drove from tulsa to BBNTA a few months ago, i had to take my shoes off
cuz THEY were falling asleep! the person i was carabussing with said he
drives like that all the time, too. i assume he meant on long trips.

&gt; Back in the sixties the Traffic Safety  Institute 
&gt; (I believe) ran commercials advising drivers to take off their shoes 
on long 
&gt; trips.  It was supposed to help you stay alert at the wheel.
