Subject: Catch-22 / Can't open Slider

This is really embarassing.

You know that little area in a '69 Westy, just ahead of the spice rack, on 
the floor, between the sink and the sliding door? It's perfect for putting a 
bottle of Windex (tm), 409 (tm) and the such.

Well, I put a tall can of Pledge (tm) in there, and closed the slider. Can't 
open the slider anymore. Why? The inside handle can't move forward. Because 
the tall can of Pledge (tm) is there.

I can't fish the bottle out from the inside, either. It fit too tight.

What's next?
