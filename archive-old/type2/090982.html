Subject: Re: 2.0 oil drain plug

Thanks for all the help and suggestions.  

So.. I've discovered that the drain plug for Type 4
engines (the side plug, not the sump plate one) came
in 12 and 14 mil thread sizes.  Pulled one off a
friend's spare engine last night and it was 12 mil. 
Mine's 14.  Oh well.  

Found the part, and a copper seal ring, from Bus Boys
-it's on the way.  Meanwhile, I'm keeping my fingers
crossed that the lug bolt fix stays put.

- Randy
