&lt;&lt; Where do these guys get our e-mail addresses?

I never got any gunny requests to purchase my bus, but I often get offers
to take 20 million $ treasury cheques and other miscellaneous scams &amp;
spams.  It's funny because I don't give out my address anywhere - except
for the type2 and vanagon lists.

Regards,
Shawn.

Anyone can join a list...Even the bad guys to harvest email addresses...;-(
Speaking of spam, I've got a few cartoon anthologies from the New Yorker
and one of 'em (WW II vintage), has a couple of Russian soldiers looking
at cases piled up on a dock. The caption? &quot;What's a Spam?&quot;
