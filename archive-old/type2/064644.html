Subject: looking for type II

hello all... i have two quick announcements for the list...  first, i'm
looking for a pre-67 truck or crew cab or a 71 truck or crew cab (i'm not
interested in any other years... it is going to be used for a restoration
project in very vw frindly houselhold... rust is o.k. but the less the
better... no engine and or on transmission is a definite plus... rolling
chasis is a plus but not a must...  anything that fits within those
parameters and is in the southern california area will receive serious
consideration...

secondly, i'm selling a '65 type I (i know this a type two list!)... it is
customized for the 'cal look'... factory sunroof... strong 1600 cc dual
port... polished five spoke empis... the car is white with a custom gray
interior... it has a custom header and exhaust system... cd player...
front end that can be adjusted for ride height... the only thing wrong
with the car is some minor body damage up front and on the rear fender...
the asking price is $2100 but it is negotiable...

thanxs....

alfio
