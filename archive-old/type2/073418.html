I just checked on it - currently $355, says it is brand new and in perfect
condition.  It also happens to be somewhere here in the Dallas/Ft.Worth
area.  Since I am going to EveryBus this April, I would be happy to
transport this tent to EveryBus or anywhere along the way to save the cost
of shipping.  If so, contact me offlist.
