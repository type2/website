Subject: Re: [T2] Tire shop apes broke my bus (long)

&lt;It's still no guarantee. The right source is only yourself having been to
that shop before and it's still possible for future screwups to occur.&gt;

Exactly. I have recommended a shop here in town several times and had very good results with them. I am a big husky bearded ugly looking fellow. 1 female I know that I had recommended the shop to came back a story of unecessary work being done with out her permission. I still would use them (they have an inhouse machine shop) but I am careful about who I recommend them to...
