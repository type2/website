Subject: Re: Bad CV? or Bad Brake?

Well I got all 4 wheels in the air and checked the CV's all was clean and
tight (they were replaced this winter at MOFOCO). It was good to look at
them. Three wheels made no noise when I turned them -- one made a grinding
noise. That one is the rear left wheel. I have not pulled a drum on this
bus, and need some help from the list.

How do I pull it?

I am under the belief that I will need to crank off the Axle Nut. ('78 bus)

Is that true?

If so is it 36mm? All other knowledge will help.

I used Harmon's easy fix(attached) so I could get to work and all is quite.
But I HAVE to get in there to see for myself.

My Symptoms(attached) pointed to many potential problems. I looked at most
of them. But I had a suspect that the emergency brake was involved. Also
wanted to check the CV' because of the recent work done on them. I will let
you all know what I find in the drum.

Thanks for all the help

&gt;     I've had intermittent problems that sound about like what you're
&gt;describing, but it's definitely my rear emergency brake shoe. I'm not
&gt;sure what it does, but it seems to happen if I brake hard while going
&gt;backwards, and it's only on one side, but it makes a rapid sort of
&gt;clunk-clunk-clunk-clunk as I'm going along, more noticable of course
&gt;when coasting to a stop. The way I make it go away is to pull the
&gt;emergency brake on as hard as I can (only my e-brake doesn't work really
&gt;since the left side backing plate is all ratted out where the e-brake
&gt;cable goes in) and go in reverse and slam on the brake a few times. Or
&gt;take the drum off and relocate the brake shoe.

&gt;Well I logged in to post about a clunking sound coming from my '78 bus.
&gt;
&gt;Started yesterday when I was pulling out of my garage. The bus felt like it
&gt;was glued down with one deep CLUNK. I thought it was water on the floor of
&gt;the garage frozen to the tire. No outstanding sounds all was happy in the
&gt;bus during the ride to work.
&gt;
&gt;But then similar clunk when I left my parking space at the end of the day.
&gt;I was distracted and did not make much of it then. Bit of a clunking sound
&gt;during the drive home; faint and only lasted for a few blocks.
&gt;
&gt;This mornings CLUNK could not bet ignored. Same feeling of a tire stuck to
&gt;the floor. Denise was driving and thinks it was the front right wheel. But
&gt;then it started to clunk, keeping time with our speed. Went around the
&gt;block and parked it in front of our house.
&gt;
&gt;I will be opening it up tonight when I get home.
&gt;
&gt;I will start looking for a loose brake caliper.
&gt;
&gt;Anything else I should be looking for?
&gt;
&gt;I also need to mention that I use my parking brake.
&gt;
&gt;
