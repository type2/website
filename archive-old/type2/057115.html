&gt; for this post.  I have various good used thermostats and noticed 
&gt; that some have stamped into them what I believe is a  temperature 
&gt; degree range.  Some have 65-70 degrees ranges, while others 
&gt; have 75-80 degree ranges.  Does anyone have info that explains 
&gt; which (or what other) thermostat is correct for what engines?  Does 
&gt; anybody have a VW workshop manual that breaks this info down 
&gt; accurately?

The Engine volume of the VW Workshop Manual (1973 issue) lists only the
thermostat with the opening temp of 65-70 deg C (149-158 deg F) for both
the 1600 type I engine and the 1700 type IV.  I too have come across
thermostats bearing higher opening temperatures, but I do not know the
intended application for these.  A guess would be they are for colder
climates, the type where chrome valve covers are needed and heat is a good
thing! 

Speaking of thermostats, I had the misfortune of discovering a thermostat
stuck in the partially open position (i.e., it wouldn't close completely
or open more when heated).   It didn't dissuade me from installing another
one, just remember to check the operation of the thermostat
occasionally.  On a grimmer note, I almost purchased a thermostat from a
local vendor--until I realized it was partially (and
unevenly around its diameter) opened.  This was a new German thermostat
(box said made in Germany, but the brand name was not familiar).  It
appeared there was too much gas in the bellows (i.e., it wouldn't contract
completely, but it might've expanded to open the flaps completely).  If
you're not using a properly functioning used thermostat and plan to buy a
new one, just make sure it is within spec before putting it on your
engine.
