Tony,

Yep, one of the guys in our local club has had one for at least 2 years 
and there was a guy around town that was trying to sell some for awhile.
The only complaint from the guy who bought it was that it seemed sort of 
&quot;gutless&quot;.


For most vw folks, the $11,500 price is a bit steep unless you look at it 
as a &quot;new car&quot;....which it mostly is.  They sure do look nice with 
metallic paint though.

I talked to the guy trying to sell them here and basically, they take
a/your pan and strip it, paint it and then put *everything* from the new
one on/in it.  If i remember correctly, they even put new pans on 
it.....

From torsion bars out. 


Cheers, dave

&gt; No recommendation.  YMMV, buyer beware!

&gt; OK...Everybody's heard of the scam/process...
&gt; Has anybody actually bought or know some-
&gt; one who bought one... ?-(
