Subject: Re: [T2] type 2 on CD

I believe what you are referring to is the ETKA parts CD?
Yes, that is available cheap.

This referrence is about all the Bentley repair manuals being made on CD's.

p.s., you are sending double posts because one of them has 'pon' in the
address. You can delete either one.

&gt; here in holland i got it for 10 dollars complete all types , but it not
&gt; worth getting it , it only runs under os 98 and with a monitor at atleast
&gt; 1200 by 1200 resolution , if you go to some germaN WEBSIDE ABOUT T2 YOU CAN
&gt; DOWNLOAD LEGALY A ZIP FILE CONTAINING THE SAME INFO AND NUMBERS FOR FREE
&gt; GREETINGS CO
