just nopticed you have hydros...I have never tried the 911 adjusters with
them, as we do not build any hydro engines...If you try it, let us know how
they work

&gt; To use swivel feet, you must get rid of the large diameter rocker shafts
&gt; that you have stock, and opt for 1.7 only rockers with 8mm adjusting
&gt; screws..By doin g this you can use any type 1 adjuster....I highly
&gt; recommeend facing the surface of the rcoker, at the valve adjuster a full
&gt; .060 to all ow for more adjustability..
&gt;
&gt; The only valve adjusters we use with these are Genuine 911 the
aftermarkets
&gt; just don't make it, even Berg has problems.. Be sure and soak them in oil
a
&gt; solid day prior to assembling the engine, to lube the ball/socket
&gt; well...They seldom alter rocker geometry, as no major adjustments have
been
&gt; amade, and all ratios are the same..

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; hello all. does anyone out there know where I might get my greasy little
&gt; &gt; mitts on a set of swivel foot, or is it feet or perhaps footi ;)
adjusters
&gt; &gt; for a '78 2L FI engine with hydro lifters? Anybody see a reason why I
&gt; &gt; shouldn't use them if they are available? Guess I'll also need to know
&gt; where
&gt; &gt; to get the shims/spacers/etc..to keep the VT geometry correct, right?
&gt; &gt; Thanks,
