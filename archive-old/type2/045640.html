Subject: [T2] managing list email

List,
Sometime, maybe a year ago, some list member made a suggestion on how to
divert list mail to a separate folder (or some other software term, I'm
not too computer literate!), so that it was someplace separate of other
email and the incredible volume of list mail would not overwhelm other
important messages (not that type2 stuff in NOT important!). 
Since I restarted on the list I'm looking for a better way to manage
this list volume. By the way, I'm using Netscape 4.61, if that makes a
difference.
