Subject: Re: [T2] Light Assembly Refubish

Hi Jon,

Chrome reflectors are plastic coated, real thin almost like paint, if
not paint. I have painted chrome and used silver rub n buff, and not
had great results with either. I bought tail light assemblies from Bus
Boys. Probably repops though.

 I am in the process of deciding how to refurbish the parts on my 68 Double
 cab. The rear back-up, Brake and front turn signal assemblies are pretty
 dull and rusted.

 Is the chrome on the inside that acts as a reflector for the lamps real
 chrome? It seems awfully thin and easily comes off when I tried a little
 chrome polish.

 Question, what can I do to refurbish the chrome? Paint it with chrome paint,
 have them chromed or buy NOS?

 I can't seem to find anybody selling the NOS lamp bodies for the brake, turn
 and backup light. I only find the lenses for sale.

 Any guidance would be appreciated
