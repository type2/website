Subject: torque converters late vs. early

I'm thinking of putting a  2.0 liter engine into a '74 bus. The '74 has an auto tranny and the '78/'79 engine comes with a torque converter. Any chance this is a straight bolt-on? That is, are the torque converters the same on '78-79 buses and '74 buses?

Thanks! Joe
