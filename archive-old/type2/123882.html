Subject: Re: [T2] cot dam

Steve asked:

 my head is dammed up with cot, and getting a trip together. i want to put a
late bay cot in an early bay cab. i have the early bay poles and hooks but
the later set [3 sided arrangement] appears more buff. so, in going with
late cot in the 69 am i hissing up a rope, anyone know about fitting - the
cabs are different are not they?
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

 68 to 73 poles are all 56 1/4&quot;, no matter if they are round or 3 sided.

How long are your poles?  If they are 57 1/4&quot;, they are 74/75 poles.
They will work but you will need to lower the half moons, to the same position as 
75 to 79.
