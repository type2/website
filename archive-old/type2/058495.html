This is a great site, gives a lot of confidence that this can be done by
someone on their own.

I'd love to see someone do a similar write-up for Battery Tray replacement.
I'm curious how the welding is done, how you cut close to the main body
walls, etc.

Anyone out there ready to do a battery tray and has the skill to do a step
by step for the rest of us?
