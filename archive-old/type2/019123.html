i was checking the timeing/dwell on my 72 bus (stock setup, as far as i
know) when i hit it with the timeing light i couldent find the mark so i
started going up and down the scale, and i found it. AT 28 BTDC!!
unfortunately my dwell meeter is older then my bus and its very finiky
when it was reading the dwell was at something like 20 Degrease, i dont
trust that reading though, i set the points three weeks ago, maybe its
time to check them again. anyway, what the hell is going on? i dident
even thing it could run at 28 btdc. maybe if the dwell is that far
off.....
