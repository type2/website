For less than $20 you can get a diode + digital voltage display that
plugs into any cig. lighter outlet. Got it at local FLAPS (Napa) -has
green, orange, red diodes.  I took one and mounted it inside a project
box from Radioshack, first cutting out the box so the display is
visible.  The box includes my digital &quot;meat thermometer&quot; oil temp gauge
and a vdo oil prressure gauge.

I am wanting to duplicate (in function at least) something I saw in a 
motorcycle mag for use on my motorcycle and in my VW. Would be useful
for 
boats, tractors, jet skis, RV's, etc. The catalog price is quite steep 
compared to my quick mental estimate of the parts.

It is a simple looking little thing that has three colored LED lights
that 
tell you that the charging system is GOOD, NOT SO GOOD, and SOL - - - - 
green, yellow, red.
