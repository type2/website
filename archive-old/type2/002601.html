Well, as you may have surmised, I hit some snags in getting things off the
ground last weekend, but we're still going forward.

I have changed the start date to next Sunday, Oct. 10th. All North American
participants should have received an email today with the explanation of the
change. If you DID NOT receive an email today, and you are in North America,
please send me an email ASAP so we can make sure you're included.

My apologies for the slow start, but look out world, the Great BusTour is
coming!
