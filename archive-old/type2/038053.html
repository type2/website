&gt; Do a web search for Tatra. They made something that looks very much like

Here's a page, for those who don't want to bother searching:

Though the Tatra trucks look interesting (19l, 470bhp 12cyl air-cooled
diesel, anyone?), they're not what I was looking at.  I wish I could go take
a look at it now, since I don't remember too much about it...  It had a
TypeIV engine, and something that looked suspiciously like a bus
transaxle...  it was defenitely VW.  I didn't get a chance to check out the
mounts and such, though (which, I'd assume, would look fabricated were it a
custom thing).

Oh well.  If anyone in Northern California runs across &quot;El Tonka&quot; (it's blue
and funny-looking), drop a line?  :)

Oh, specifically, it was parked on (I think) Starret Hill Dr. in Monte Rio,
vaugely near a broken '69 autostick beetle.
