&gt; hi all - i am getting set to hang door panels for the first time since
i

friday-type
&gt; question: what sort of adhesive has best proven itself to stick
plastic
&gt; sheets to the cab doors. i was hoping to find something like the goo
vw
&gt; used, since it was pealable and repealable, and repealable again.
standing
&gt; by for this vital vw info.   - steve

I replaced the moisture barrier in the front doors of my camper and
adhered it with 3M Super 77 spray adhesive. It's about $7 a can. When
you first put it on it's fairly tacky, so you can reposition several
times before pressing it down flat. The doors don't leak at all, so I
guess it works.
