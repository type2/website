Hi all,
I just serviced my newly acquired Westy, and have a coulpe of questions.
My Vanagon requires 15-50 for the summer months, so when I changed my
oil this evening, I used this oil.
I figured it this way.
The Vanagon is liquid cooled, and the T-2 is air, so the engine is under
higher stresses, and the oil would have a preponderence of breaking down
sooner, thus the need for a higer visosity oil----right?
I read the owners manual, and it says to use straight 40w oil but with
new technology in oils, I figured that the 15-50 would be OK.
What kind of oil pressures are these engines running?
At 65,mph, my oil pressure is at 55 psi----OK?
When in town, it is at 40psi.

 What constant cruising speed is safe for these vans?
I ran it at 70 on the way home the week-end before last when I picked it
up In Souix Falls SD.
The rpm was at about 4000.
Too fast?

The oil temp was at about  250 degrees for most of the trip.

And now for the last question.
The bus has 185x14 Michelins on it.
The load rating is 1450 lbs, _at_ 40 psi.
I checked the tire pressure, and they were all at 32 psi, so I jacked
them up to 34 psi.
I don't want a rock-hard, bang, bang, bang ride, but I want the tires to
function properly.
Is this air pressure OK?

And while talkig about tires, I want to increase the size of the tire
for a better ride, and handling.
How big of a tire can I put on it?
205's, 225's ?

Thanks for your help, and comments,
