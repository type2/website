Subject: Victor Reinz Gasket Set

(I asked this on the Samba and got zero responses so far. Trying here...)

I picked up a Victor Reinz gasket set from a local VW shop (yay! I said
local! Only 30 minutes away! LoL!) and the label is confusing. It doesn't
seem like it would have the head gaskets for my 1700, though it does have
head gaskets in it. Here's the label info:

914 - 1.8 85 PS (62,5 KW) 1,8 LTR. 1973/
________________________________

Even though it shows the year (73) it says 1.8. Don't the 1.8 and
2.0engines have larger bores at the head? And wouldn't that mean
1.8 head gaskets wouldn't work? The shop said that it has both sizes in it.
Kind of odd, but ok. There appears to be lots of ring-like items, but
without opening the package I can't tell. Plus, there's a sticker on there
that says &quot;WARNING Not returnable once opened&quot; so I'm leary of opening it.
