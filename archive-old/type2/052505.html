Subject: Re: [T2] Flywheel won't stop spinning

&gt; Hey all,
&gt;    I have a question about my flywheel.  I have a 78' baywindow FI.
&gt; When I come to a stop and try to go into reverse, all I get is
&gt; grinding.  Sometimes if I put shifter into 3rd or 4th gear and then
&gt; go to reverse it will let me in with out grinding.  But most of the
&gt; time it wont stop spinning and I get grinding.  Leaving me to turn
&gt; the engine off to put it into reverse.  Anyone have and ideas on
&gt; whats goin on or what to do to solve this problem??  Thanks for your
&gt; help.

Your problem is not the flywheel.....it turns all the time the engine is
running.
Your problem is the transmission won't stop turning when you step on the
clutch.
Where does the clutch grab when you take off in 1st gear?
Right as you start to let up?
How much free-play [the movement in the clutch pedal when you just put your
foot on it and push down before the cable starts to move] do you have?
Probably over an inch and close to two inches?
1st, adjust your clutch so the cable is tighter. Go for about a 1/2&quot; of
freeplay. This should fix your 'grind going into reverse' problem.
If adjusting all the freeplay out does not correct it, you have a bad clutch
pressure plate. The travel of the diaphragm spring is not enough to release
the disc.
