Speaking of, my horn wire just broke right below the button in the
steering column of my '63 DC. Frayed wiring.  It's lovely to drive down
the road with your horn going off the whole time.  I wonder if it's not
possibly the most fitting attention I should be getting while driving it
anyhow.

Peace..
