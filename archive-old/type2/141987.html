Subject: ramp idea

Take a look at the asking price at
     www.discountramps_dot_com/car_display_ramp.htm
then go to Horrible Freight and check out the kinds of lifts they offer.  No, I 
am not plugging
   www.harborfreight_dot_com, but they offer a lift that's capable of 3 or 4 ft 
working height, and is powered by house current, for much the same price -- 
seems to me to represent more value than a static drive-on.

I saw a display ramp at a used car lot. You drive the car up a ramp then 
it levels out for display. I wish I had a picture. It would be great for 
valves and oil changes, or working on anything under the bus. Anyone 
know where to get one?
