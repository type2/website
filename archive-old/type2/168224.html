Subject: Bug Bomb?

I have noticed that I have been finding more and more little bugs crawling
and flying around in my bus here and there. I even found a yellow-jacket
nest (old one) under the chassis this afternoon.

Has anyone actually done a bug bomb to their car after it has been out of
commission for a while?

I cannot imagine that it could be bad for me as long as I air it out well
(after the bomb is done). But I still would like to know if anyone else has
done anything like this before.
