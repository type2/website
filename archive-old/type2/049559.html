&gt; Hey all!
&gt; When I bought my '75 camper, all the heat channels, heat control boxes, etc.
&gt; were gone.  Yes completely gone.  The heat exchangers were both there and
&gt; appeared to be OK.  Being the financially strapped master of &quot;rig&quot; that I am,
&gt; I &quot;creatively engineered&quot; a new main channel out of PVC pipes and connected
&gt; the heat exchangers to this pipe via flexible aluminum vent pipes.  Amazingly
&gt; enough, this rig seemed to work in getting some heat into my bus!  That's the
&gt; good news...the bad news is that I started smelling fumes, and my eyes got a
&gt; little watery and burning (not a good sign, right?).  My question is this:  Is
&gt; fumes in the cab a sign of a bad heat exchanger or is it probably just a
&gt; &quot;design flaw&quot; in my engineering marvel (possibly not a perfect seal where the
&gt; alumnium pipes connect with the heat exchanger??)  Any advice would be
&gt; appreciated..

Are you sure it's not essence of PVC pipe? Go get a hunk of triple-wall
chimney from a wood stove dealer and use that insteam.
