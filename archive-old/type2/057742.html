Subject: 72 Hightop Camper FS Orlando, Florida

I stopped at a local used car dealer who had a yellow hightop bus on his lot with an $1800 price tag on it. I took a look, it had 88K on the odometer, interior looked clean,
had a dual carbed 1700 without a seal, some rust spots on the lower windshield frame and battery tray. Overall the bus was in good condition.

Please call the dealer _at_ (407) 273-6085 for more info, or e-mail me and I can take a better look at it if you are interested.

Thanks, Tim Hannink	 Winter Park, Florida	hanninkt_at_ix_dot_netcom_dot_com
