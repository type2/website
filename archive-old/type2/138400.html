Subject: Re: [T2] Porsche facts

However, one must observe that we are not looking at anything even 
remotely connected to Porsche AG.  If you want to know what the factory 
thought of the 914, pick up a copy of Paul Frere's &quot;The Racing 
Porsches.&quot; There on page 155 you will find a photo of Porsche's racing 
stable.  And there with the 917, 917 PA, 908/02, 908 long-tail, etc, 
you'll find the &quot;lowly&quot; 914. Positioned ahead of the 911s.

That the Porsche-ista don't acknowledge it just means that they STILL 
don't get it. A well setup 914/4 will run competitively with a 
similarly prepped 911 at about a third the investment. The 50/50 weight 
distribution makes a world of difference.

But it's still a lousy motor for a bus. No bottom end torque.
