Hmmm....I replaced the fuel pump on my '69 &lt;before&gt;
converting to an alternator. It looked pretty much the
same as the one I pulled off, but I wasn't really
comparing as I was doing this repair in front of the
FLAPS (BIG fine, if caught;-).

When I converted to an alternator, it all fit the way
it should, no problem. 

Maybe the new ones fit universaly? Maybe it was 'cause
I used an Empi (maybe Bugpack, don't remember)
alternator stand? Or, maybe this is one of those little
myths you hear....seems to me Ken Hooper also said
something similar.

Dunno.
