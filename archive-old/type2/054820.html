Subject: Re: high top conversions

Hey there, that's right there were factory high roof campers in Germany. I
have an ETKA CD that has parts explosions and part numbers of every single
Audi/VW from 49' to the early 90s and they do show high roof campers and
part numbers for the roofs, I believe both bay and vanagon.

PS I will make copies of the CD if someone wants it BUT it's VERY
frustrating for us air-cooled people. It is a VW/Audi parts database and
every part that is NLA as of the CD date does NOT have a part number, just
&quot;NLA&quot;. I hit the BA6 page and I think there was 1 part number listed. Same
for any older VW like a 66 bus.The explosion diagrams are cool BUT are not
the greatest quality and are in a proprietary format so they can't be
extracted, only screen shots. The interface is a PITA to get around in.
Plus it requires a MINIMUM resolution of 1280x1024 to even install. On the
other hand it's cool to see all the features that VW offered in the rest of
the world, like Vanagons with 5 cyl TDI engines and 5 speeds. WinBloze 9x
only, very problematic with NT. Should work on a real computer (Mac) in
softwindows etc

Just for the record:  Wrong.  There were factory highroof Kombis
available.  Rumour has it that factory highroof Westies could be
ordered too (as could hardtop or sunroof Westies), but I've never
come across one of those.  But after all, what's a Westy other
than a Kombi that's been to Wiedenbrück?  ;-)  (Well, almost.)

&gt; VW made bay window busses with a factory fitted high-top, BUT they were
only
&gt; fitted to panel vans. So if your looking for a Combi or Camper this will
&gt; have been a conversion!
