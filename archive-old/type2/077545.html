Subject: Re: [T2] '73/'74 Dash Trade

&gt; I'd say that uncracked plastic dashes of that vintage make hens' teeth
&gt; look plentiful!  Perhaps in a museum, but not in a real-world bus!  Also,
&gt; I don't think any buses came to the US with fewer than three holes in
&gt; them (light switch, wipers, hazards) and probably two or three more
&gt; (interior light, defroster, silver socket).

They make molded replacement caps for bugs etc so why not busses?
