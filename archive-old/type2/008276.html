Howdy!

My wife and I are organizing a campout for all of our friends from school,
work, and G.R.O.O.V.E. (our VW club) and thought that some of you out there
may be interested.  It is on Saturday, March 6, 1999 in the Missouri Ozarks
about an hour east of Springfield.  If you would like more information,
please p-mail me at the following address: bug_at_windo.missouri_dot_org 

P.S. It will probably be Monday before I can get back to you.

Peace,
Erich Elmer
