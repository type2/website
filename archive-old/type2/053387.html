Subject: Westy water tank removal - '79 Westy

'79 Westy 
How does one remove the plastic fill spout from the water tank? I have tried
unscrewing it, and it rotates, but does not back out. Is this spout threaded
into the tank, or a press fit? I think my tank may have a crack in it, so I
am trying to remove it for inspection.
