Hi Volks!
Ok,my other survey was fun so I'm doing another one while its still Friday.I've been hearing a lot of great bumperstickers ever since the discussion of &quot;tunung the t2 operator&quot; began.Most are t2 related and refer to the speed of them.Being a collecter of bumperstickers(60 I think)I love them.What bumperstickers grace the many windows of your type 2's and what are your favorites.I love my magic bus sticker,my Grateful Dead  sticker w/camper,and of course the one that reads &quot;I brake for people who read bumperstickers&quot;.Thanks in advance, and I'll post the results on an upcoming Friday.
