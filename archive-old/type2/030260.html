Possibly...but i doubt that it is causing your problem.  Esp not with the
pointless ignition installed. It is there to give an additional, and more
solid, ground path for the points.

&gt; am not clear on which distributor I should obtain. For my model year 
&gt; and engine I see 009 and 050 distributors, which is preferable?

Eh!  No no no no no no no. Putting a 009 or 050 on a FI engine is just
asking for headaches.  The advance curves...or lack there of, are just all
wrong for the FI (actually, for most any street driven VW..but we wont go
there.)

Stick points and condensor in and see if that fixes it..if so, get a new
pertronix.
