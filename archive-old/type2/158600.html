&gt; The 2 liter 4 banger manual 78 Camper is still chugging at 246K mi, all
&gt; original including Tranny- burns/blows a little oil, but gets about
&gt; 21-23 mph at 55 mpg.

&gt;    Actually if you check the stats, the Tucker is probably the longest 
lasting
of almost all cars...98% of them are still around and running... ;-)
