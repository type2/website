Michael,

It sounds like an extra air leak someplace.  It could
even be the air bypass valve.  These make a tremendous
difference in fast idle speed, and of course if
they're not working right, on hot idle speed as well. 
The one on my 1980 Westfalia was adjustable, although
I had to take it off the van and disassemble it to
adjust.  They heat up electrically to taper off the
flow of bypass air as the engine warms up.

&gt; Hello:
&gt; 
&gt; I just rebuilt the engine in a 1979 Westy 2.0 F.I.
&gt; 
&gt; Currently trying to set the timing after readjusting
&gt; the Hydraulic valves.
&gt; Touch and turn twice, tighten the nut and your done
&gt; kinda adjustment.
&gt; 
&gt; Then I wanted to see the difference. It starts real
&gt; good but I'm
&gt; not sure why the motor has a hard time running below
&gt; 2000 rpm.
&gt; 
&gt; According to the Ignition timing instructions for
&gt; air-cooled Volkswagens.
&gt; I should be able to run at idle to set the timing.
&gt; 
&gt; I've lined up TDC based on the Crank pulley and
&gt; Rotated the Distributor to
&gt; the
&gt; mark in the distributor body. I have a Fuel Injected
&gt; Ignition system with a
&gt; solid state control unit.
&gt; Would that get me out of the &quot;setting points&quot;
&gt; pre-requisite?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.
&gt; Can't wait to drive this thing again.
&gt; 
&gt;
