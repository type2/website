Subject: [T2] Tires Again??

I've searched the Archives and really come up with more questions.
Simply put; Is anyone running a Tire on there Bus that has a load
capacity of 1350lbs to 1400lbs?  Everything I find in the Size I looking
for is in the 1301 to 1375 range.  They will be on a 66 Bus with Custom
Camper interior
