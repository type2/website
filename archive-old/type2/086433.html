Subject: Re: [T2] Re:  Hydraulic Lifters

&gt; Bob's words are hardly novel, this is the way most people have
&gt; been bleeding Bus lifters for years.

Huh?  Most busses I have worked on have never had the lifters adjusted even
close to zero lash......Usually they are all crappy.  I adjust the lifters
to zero and people drive off and call me telling me their car never runs so
good!

I&gt; at most I've only put together 4-5 T4's a year but I've never had a
&gt; problem doing it with compressions warm or cold, but I have observed
&gt; the problem he alludes to on Steve's old '73 ('79 engine) before we
&gt; put a rebuilt engine in it.


I would go with Bob's advice on this since he probably rebuilds at least 30
or 40 type 4 engines per year  along with a bunch of wasserboxers and type 1
engines........
