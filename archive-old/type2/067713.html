Subject: Re: Information NEEDED. Engine tranny question.

&gt;   I have the chance to buy a 1975 Combi but the engine is disassembled
&gt;   and I
&gt;   was wondering if I could use my 2l 1978 engine that has a progressive
&gt;   carb
&gt;   with the 75 tranny.

Steve,

The '75 uses a different size flywheel (215 mm, I believe), while the '78
is 228 mm. The simplest would be to put the '75 flywheel on the '78
engine. Alternatively, you could swap bellhousings, but that's probably
more work.

The '75 also has a slightly different gear ratio, but that shouldn't be a
big deal. Slap on bigger tires to compensate if it bugs you.

Another issue is that the '75 was fuel injected and there's a large metal
bracket on the right-hand side of the engine compartment; it was
originally used to hold the large air filter box and might be in the way
of your carbs. Of course, you could cut it off, but that's a somewhat
irreversible measure. Have you thought of using the '75 fuel injection
equipment instead? (If not, I'll happily take the F.I. stuff off your
hands... :) 

Sami ('75 Westf.)
