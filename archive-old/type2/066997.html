Subject: Re: Where would you go in your VW?

Howdy Volks

I know this was a Friday question, but time zones mean I'm ready for bed by
the time y'all start chatting.

Anyway, where to go next in our VW is a constant conversation topic in our
house. My wife and I have travelled fairly extensively in Southern Africa
in a succession of split buses (we used to tour in a panel van, and since
having kids we got the 63 Dormobile, which is perfect for camping with a
young family), but my big dream is Cape to Cairo -- about 16 000km through
Africa.  There are many possible routes, but the east coast route is prolly
best as there are tar roads all the way from Cape Town to Kenya. After
that, potential problems start as the continent is bisected by Sudan and
Zaire. Sudan is in a vicious civil war and is not generally safe for
overlanders, while Zaire is impassable for all but about three months of
the year due to the rainy season, when people generally travel by boat as
all roads are under water. Anyway, Africa is a big continent, so we'll only
plan the route when we're getting ready to go ...

&lt;*WARNING!!!*: lurid description of type2 butchery follows -- the
squeamish, faint-hearted and originality nazis trash this message now.&gt;

Because I feel the Dormobile is too valuable to abuse on poor roads, we
have just started to convert my beat-up old Brazilian 1975 split-screen
panel (still a roadworthy daily driver, but looks very sorry since being
rear-ended by a double-decker bus two years ago) into a rough-road camper
for our continued tours on the Southern African subcontinent, but when I'm
finished with it, it should be able to handle a trans-Africa trip. I'm
replacing some of the more mangled rear and side body panels with decent
ones from a parts car, as well as welding in windows from the parts bus.
The next plan calls for a home-made pop-top (in aluminium) for which I have
the roof bunk from an early-70s westy, and to convert the van into a
walk-thru (the roof is also in a sorry state, since a roller-shutter door
at work closed on it!). I'll also build in a westy-type camper interior and
add some custom roof racks to go in front of and behind the pop-top.

Because of the poor quality of many African roads, I am trying to locate a
ZF (OEM supplier) limited slip diff, and will also try for max ground
clearance on the van, probably by using off-road tread pattern tyres on
15in rims. Unfortunately, that's an obsolete tyre size, but a factory in
Mozambique is still making them. I also intend to increase front-end
protection with some kind of bush-bar with spare tyre mounted on it. Some
of my VW lit shows plans for under-body protection on type2s, which will
also be added.

In the long term, I would like to fit a Peugeot diesel engine with dual
radiators, one behind each engine air-intake vent. Peugeot 404s and 504s
are ubiquitous throughout Africa, meaning parts will be easier to come by
than air-cooled VW parts, and in many parts of Africa petrol is
unavailable, very expensive, or for sale only to locals, whereas diesel is
freely obtainable. The other benefit of a diesel engine is that it runs at
about the same revs as a stock aircooled unit, with not dissimilar power
output. Since I have a newly-rebuilt 1600DP engine in the car now, that is
a plan for the future.

So you think my ideas are sacrilegious? Well, I'm normally a fully-paid-up,
card-carrying member of the originality police, but my poor old van has
been so comprehensively beaten up that I really don't feel bad about
hacking it up like this. Most people would have scrapped it years ago.
Meanwhile, my 57 Kombi is 100% original, and when the Afrikamper is done,
the Dorm will undergo a detailed (original) resto to bring it from its
current good original (unrestored) condition to perfection. Oh, and if
that's not enough to redeem me, then I'll recite 1 000 Hail Pons:-)

Hope y'all enjoyed sharing my travel dreams ;-)
