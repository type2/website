&gt; Tyler,
&gt; 	I like to use Permatex Aviation Gasket sealer.  It's purply black,
&gt; stays tacky, and comes off easily when you change them.  Try it out.

Hylomar works well too,  Grease isn't such a good idea, since it aids the
gasket in slipping out of position.  BTDT.

After years of trying to find a good multi-use gasket, I finally came to
the conclusion that the stock cork rubber-impregnated gaskets work best if
you replace them every time.  They are cheap and I buy them by the dozen
at the local VWFLAPS.  FelPro also makes excellent rubber gaskets if you
want to experiment.

Of course, the best thing between the gasket and head is nothing.

&gt; I am doing this for the first time tonight. I searched through the archives
&gt; and
&gt; my Bentley manual and I am solid on the process. I just have one question.
&gt; Will
&gt; using a small amount of grease between the cork gasket and the cover (enough
&gt; to
&gt; just wet the cork) be sufficient to hold the gasket in place while putting
&gt; the
&gt; cover on or should I look to another product to ensure proper fit. The
&gt; grease I
&gt; have is the all-purpose Lithium based stuff.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
