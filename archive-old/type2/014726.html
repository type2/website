Sorry for the use of bandwidth, but T-bear had posted a request to check out
an outfit in Long Bch that does westy canvas. When I went to check last week I
discoverd my system had eaten both T-bears address and the info reguarding the
shop. So T-bear if your out there please p-mail me and I'll check out that
shop for you.
