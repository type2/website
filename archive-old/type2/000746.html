As it appears to become customary here is my report of the trip I made to
Orlando (FL) last week.

1. Departed from home on Sat, May 22 at 10.00 hrs.
2. Got on a B**ING 767 at Amsterdam Airport.
3. Arrived in Orlando 10 minutes ahead of schedule, ha , ha ... Am not sure
what mileage this thing got (and what octane they put into it, it sure went
like hell). Also the ride was a bit bumpy. Need new shocks??

Next I went looking for the 'Rent-A-Bus' company but could not find it. So
had to make do with a CH**VY !?!

But seriously: I was very disappointed. I think that I did not see more than
a handful of buses in seven days around Orlando, Daytona and Cape Canaveral
(remember it was a business trip). Most looked worse than mine (I guess mine
look pretty good) and the drivers looked very stereotypical.

Saw one loaf with a painted on V shaped nose in Orlando (Intl Drive area), a
listmember ?

Well I'm back in Holland now. My son returned my '77, which he had borrowed
for 2 weeks, undamaged so I can continue tinkering with it. It's good to be
back home where all the buses wait.
