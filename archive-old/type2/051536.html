You can find out all about Binz on my VW trucks only site at
www.dropgates_dot_com
Even have a few for sale on there in the classifieds, Binz and normal
DC's...bring your wallet tho =) Binz is still in business in germany,
although they dont want to bother talkin about the Binz DC (they make lots
of coachbuilts, especially ambulances). As far as makin your own, Ronnie of
oldvolks_dot_com is makin a barndoor binz usin a 57 SC, a barndoor front ,rear,
and roof clip, Yikes.

Subject: [T2] Double Cab Questions


&gt; I have been looking at some DCs the last few days, and not
&gt;finding much. I have seen some though that they call &quot;Binz&quot; Double Cabs.
&gt;What is this, I see it on the older ones (50's-60's)
&gt; Also, anyone know of any DCs for sale any year, any
&gt;condition? I would prefer a 68+, but am open to any.
&gt; Now for a hard question, has anyone ever converted a Bus
&gt;into a Double cab? How did it look? I have seen one splitty converted, but
&gt;the rear treatment was poorly done. If I do something like this, I will
want
&gt;it to look good and retain factory body lines and may even use a double cab
&gt;door and side window. I have all the tools, some experience and a shop. It
&gt;would be possible for me to do, but I would like to learn from others
first.
&gt;I have done a bunch of work on the computer with drawings I have of Buses,
I
&gt;played around and it will look O.K.
&gt; Right now I am just exploring.
