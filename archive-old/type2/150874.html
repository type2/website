Subject: Re: [T2] Frosted glass

and coming up from behind is . . .

(1)  I frosted the windows in my garage doors by spraying on a frosting that 
was made for shower stall doors.  It had a girl stepping out of a shower, 
and it seemed to do the job.  I had a 12&amp;quot; x 12&amp;quot; stencil and I sprayed with 
that on the glass.  They came out fine, and I sold the house in 1992 and the 
frosted patterns on the windows are still fine.

(2) I was considering 'glue cracking' on the tops of my side windows.  This 
could NOT be done with tempered glass, so I would need to get sheet glass 
that was tinted and then get it cut and then sand blast the pattern and then 
apply the HORSE glue to the sand blasted areas (the glue needs something to 
grab a hold of) and then put the glass pieces away until the glue dried and 
cracked the windows as it dried and shrunk and then get the glass tempered 
and then R&amp;amp;R the VW bus glass with the final product and then . . .  Right.  
Great idea, but too much work.  And I could not find the heavy tint I 
wanted.  I am now running tint 5% on the side windows and tint 20% on the 
back window for privacy.

(3) Do they make frosted window film??

Barry sends

Glue cracking produces an effect on glass like a frosted window in late fall 
(well, in my area, late fall is moderate cold)  It is a most common pattern, 
and you would see this in hotel lobbies,  restaurants or bars.

The horse glue comes in a powder, and it must be heated or cooked in a glue 
pot, and applied hot / warm to the sand blasted area.  When it dries, it 
shrinks, and the operative word here is 'when'.  I was talking with a glass 
artist about this and he antidoted me that one late evening he was working 
alone in his 'studio' and he heard some noises from a back corner.  He 
investigated and found some panes of glass he had put aside in the corner 
and forgot about.  It took it's own time in drying, and really there is no 
target time you can use for drying.  I guess it depends on how slow the 
horse ran in its last race as Santa Anetia.  Oh, yes, the broken glass 
particles will fly off in all directions as it cracks, so it is best to let 
it dry in an enclosed space, like a refrigerator box for large pieces...

Also

I had some sand blasted work done on my VW's rear window.  This glass artist 
has a special process to recreate even a very small visible marking, like a 
dot, onto a two layered mat.  It is not laser etching, but a patented 
process he has. (The studio also does laser etching for putting names on 
champagne glasses at weddings, etc.)  He charged me $.25 per square inch for 
the 2 layer mat with the art inscribed, and $.15 to do the actual sand 
blasting.  (The rear window would not fit into his blast cabinet, and he had 
to tape a garbage bag onto the cabinet to close it off.)  Extremely 
reasonable prices, but the inches added up and it was almost $100 per window 
X 3.
