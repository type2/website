For sale 69 dormobile $3500 o.b.o. new motor, decent paint no holes, solid
frame, excellent interior
and runs and drives daily.The poptop has excellent canvas with 2 hammocks
neither of which have any
rips in them.The poptop has new window rubbers in it and comes complete with a
new vent mechanism and
vent installed. also the bus has a side awning. 

you've seen the bus so spread the word.I'm moving to europe on november the 1st
and i really don't want
to leave this bus sitting in my drive way for 2 years so if you know someone
that would be excellent. 

thanks for your help in the past and the future Erwin.
