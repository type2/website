Dale, 

I have the same setup as you, except I transplanted a hatch over my engine.
Doesn't matter for this procedure, as I can't get to that bolt and turn it
from the top. Here's what I do:

Put a 10 mm box-end wrench through the back, by your coil. Hold it with the
angle of the box facing the center of the engine. Slip the box (closed,
12-point) end on the end of the long nut. You're going to be lifting up, so
give yourself some room to lift. You only have a very small area where you
can make this work. Experience with the game Operation may help.

Lift; remove wrench; repeat about 3 times--you will move the nut no more
than one position each time. Adjust timing. Reverse.

Be careful reversing the procedure because you'll very likely move the
distributor if you're not.

Have fun! Joe
