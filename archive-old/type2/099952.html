Subject: Re: [T2] Putting in a new clutch : what's the pilot bearing
  for?

&gt;On a type4 engine the pilot bearing is located at the end of the
&gt;crankshaft. With the flywheel installed and clutch removed if you
&gt;look at the center of the bolt pattern that holds the flywheel to
&gt;the crank, there is a little hole in the center. The bearing is
&gt;difficult to see so you could stick your finger in and feel for it.
&gt;If the engine came pre assembled with the flywheel, the builder
&gt;should have replaced/installed the bearing. If yours needs replacing
&gt;you need to remove the flywheel to access it.

Thanks!

I bit the bullet and went out into the cold dark night to retrieve the
Bentley from the van last night.

So effectively, the bearing goes in before the flywheel.

What a relief! For a moment, I thought I had to pull the engine again!
