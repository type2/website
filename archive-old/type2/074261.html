&gt;Please help me quiet the old girl before I lose the
&gt;few remaining marbles I have :-)

Thanks!

Brian, I can't suggest any noise reduction techniques, but I can offer, in 
the spirit of the season, some extra marbles that I have lying about.  
(Perhaps you could use CV Joint bearings as a replacement for lost marbles 
in an emergency??  Think that's *funny*?? Look up the archives for panty 
hoses - some people actually need an excuse for having ladies' 
unmentionables in their VW's, while I, for one, need an excuse for having 
unmentionable ladies in my VW.  -&gt; see heading under  WIFE; Angry)
