Subject: Engine Removal

I finally removed my 2 liter from my 79 micro. Easy as cake. I would
make one possible suggestion for others in the removal. I used a floor
jack with a skateboard as the wood block. It worked great. Once I had
the engine lowered enough I simply rotated the jack so that the wheels
set down on the floor &amp; rolled it away. Only had to remove the bumper &amp;
lift up the bus a little bit to make it fit. I plan on looking for bad
fuel vent hoses now that I have some room. thanks for the support.

Jason
