&gt; someone has pilfered gas from my bus 

Oh man, what a cheep shot.
I figure anyone who steels from a Bus owner must be really down and out.
Luckily my PO had installed a camlock style cabinet door lock on the fuel 
door back in the 1970s during the &quot;Energy crisis.&quot;
These are available from ACE hardware and require some drilling and cutting.

Glad to hear some good new from you too.
Congrats on your sucessful refrebishments.
