Subject: Re: [T2] valve springs on hydraulic lifters

From Barry:

With hydraulic lifters, I believe that the exhaust valves need a special,
 stronger spring than with the solid lifters.  Do the intake valves ALSO need the same, stronger spring or can
I use the solid lifters springs??

There must be some way to measure the strength of the springs.  Any ideas out there??  My engine rebuilder,
who mostly does type 1 engines, says he can feel the difference when he is putting the springs on the heads.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

All 8 springs are required.

The solid lifter type 4 engines used spring # 021 109 623 J

The GE hydraulic lifter engines used spring # 021 109 623 K

Both parts are not in stock at any dealer in the Cobalt Group. You would need to check with your local dealer
to see if they are still available.
Bus Depot shows those 2 part numbers and the year differences,

Any good auto machine shop will have a valve spring tester. BUT, you would need to know the specs of the
springs to know what you are looking at.....
