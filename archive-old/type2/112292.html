Subject: Re: [T2] 1972 accelerator cable?

Check the tube in front (front is front) of the tin.  It may be catching 
there.

&lt;&lt; Hello,
 
 I am having a bad day. I have lent out my Bentley manual and the type2 
 website is down. I am trying to replace my accelerator cable on my 1972 van. 
 I have removed the cable from the left side dual carb and pushed it through 
 the engine tin. Then went to the front and unhooked the cable underneath the 
 peddle assembly. But it quickly becomes caught. Is there something else I 
 need to remove?
 
 Thanks, in advance, Phil.
