Subject: Solution: Name that mechanical failure #1

*drum roll please*

It was the fuel pump, apparently it failed outright.  When I disconnected 
the fuel line just after the pump and cranked the engine, I saw no fuel 
other than a small splash every 3-4 revolutions which I guess was 
responsible for the engine catching but not staying running.  I even 
removed the front cover of the pump to &quot;burp&quot; it, but it didn't help.  It 
was also leaking both oil *and* gas.  Lucky for us, I had previously used a 
Facet electric pump and had left it installed on the frame rail just in 
case of an emergency such as this.  I simply hooked up the positive wire to 
the coil, attached the two fuel lines and off we went.  I don't like to 
think about what we would have done without the backup pump (visions of a 
5-gallon pickle bucket on the rear bed, gravity-feeding the carbs come to 
mind).  No more Brazilian pumps for me, it's NOS or rebuilt german pumps, 
or maybe I'll just keep using the facet pump - it really wouldn't be that 
bad if I used some rubber mounts to subdue the noise.  In fact, I have a 
real soft spot for the Facet pump now that it saved us from being stranded.

Thanks for all of the replies!  Several people identified the fuel pump as 
the problem, including:

Frank Biffath
Greg Potts
Mathew Nardon

I tip my hat to you guys.  Hope you're on the AIRS list.  :)

&gt;Just got back from the road trip from Texas to Wisconsin and back in the 
&gt;bus.  All told, it was 2,600 miles.  It was a good trip and no tow trucks 
&gt;were involved, but my tired engine did give me a few suprises along the 
&gt;way.  I thought I would describe the symptoms and let the experts out 
&gt;there test their mettle.  Here is the first failure:
&gt;
&gt;The bus had run fine since the beginning of the trip.  There was a 5-10mph 
&gt;tailwind nearly the whole way thus far so I was running a bit faster than 
&gt;normal, 60-65mph on average.  In Bloomington, IL we stopped at a gas 
&gt;station and Bonnie ran in to get a soda.  While I was sitting in the 
&gt;parking lot with the bus idling, it began to miss severely.  Felt like two 
&gt;cylinders had shut off.  When I gave it some gas in neutral, the revs came 
&gt;up and it felt like all four cylinders were firing again, but after 
&gt;settling down to an idle it began to stumble again.  Bonnie returned and I 
&gt;decided to go up the road just a bit to see how the engine reacted under 
&gt;load.  Unfortunately as I was pulling out into the street the engine died 
&gt;completely and wouldn't restart.  It would crank, catch for a second and 
&gt;then die.  Repeated this several times.  Here are some facts which might 
&gt;be useful:
&gt;
&gt;We had *just* filled up with gas so the tank was completely full.
&gt;Gas was 89 octane, 10% ethanol instead of the regular stuff.
&gt;Weather was very warm (90 degrees) and humid
&gt;Dellorto DRLA 40 dual carburators with freshly oiled filters
&gt;Two inline fuel filters, the little plastic ones
&gt;Holley adjustable fuel pressure regulator set to 1psi
&gt;Newer Brazilian mechanical fuel pump from Bus Depot (maybe 2 yrs old)
&gt;Never have had a problem with rust or other fuel contaminate in the past.
&gt;New Bosch plug wires
&gt;Bosch platinum plugs
&gt;Stock points ignition
&gt;Stock dizzy with retard disconnected, set to 8 degrees BTDC
&gt;Dwell at 48 degrees
&gt;15W50 Mobil 1 synthetic oil running at about 220-230 degrees
&gt;
&gt;That's all I can think of, please send questions/guesses to me directly, 
&gt;NOT to the LIST :-) and I will post a summary later today.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
&gt;-David
