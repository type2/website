Subject: Re: [T2] Electronic Ignition- Special condenser?

&gt; I am making up a list of odds and ends that I am going

&gt; it come with a condenser? If not, is there a special
&gt; kind that I need to buy? They varry so much in price,
&gt; I just didn't want to purchase the wrong one.Thanks!

Pertronix replaces both the points and condenser.

Points are dual purpose: a trigger and a conduit for the spark so a
condenser is required to keep the spark from jumping the gap at
inappropriate times.

Unlike points, the sensor you'll install substitutes only the trigger
behavior because a solid state device sends the current to the spark plug
and has no need for the condenser.
