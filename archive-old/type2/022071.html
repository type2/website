&lt;&lt; 79 Fed version non-deluxe pop top, no rust, runs and shifts fine. Missing
 sink unit, no tables, upholstery redone. Sage green repainted dark green,
 now it is black and white zebra striped. Lady is selling it to Pick n Pull
 tomorrow morning for $80 cause it won't pass smog. They are coming at
 9:30....
 
 76 hardtop Westy. Runs. Mostly complete. Guy wants $100....
 
 I have nowhere to put them. &gt;&gt;

Sure wish there was an economical way to get vehicles from California to West 
Virginia, Ohio, PA, etc.
We see you Californians junking vehicles that would be excellent  projects 
back here.  Costs over a grand to get one here, though. I just had a project 
brought back from West Texas, and you have a good bit in them before you even 
turn a wrench.  
But a vehicle 5 years old or older with no rust in my area is something to 
behold!
Wish I had more guts (and time off), I'd fly out there and drive something 
back.
