Gentlepersons-
                       Such a deal for you multi-vehicled owners...I've a 
left behind 1969 (al-
most sure) KG coupe that's slowly dissolving into my backyard. Before it 
turns into an
iron rich compost, does anyone need pieces from it...i.e. what I've got is 
better than
the what you have not got. Small stuff could be posted (your cost, c'mon I'm 
not Santa), or picked up/over in Northern NJ, near Newark as a reference 
point. If you
bring an early Bay back bumper to trade...
Tony in NJ   e-mail with needs...I'll reply most honestly about condition and 
probably dis-
                  suade most...You've seen this car before, it's in the same 
condition as that
                   one.
