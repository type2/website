Subject: UPDATE: Re: Vacuum leak check

Doesn't look like my response to Mike got through to the list:

I've used this technique in the past and I just hate it.  It scares
the crap out of me.  My good looks are fading but, that's still almost
all I have going for me.  haha! That's why I'm trying to get the
pressure test well in control, I figure it should be more reliable
also.

Thanks again,
Ken

&gt; Hey Ken,
&gt; Here's Jason's reply to another email that can help you find leaks:
&gt;
&gt; Standard disclaimers about using flammable liquids in am engine bay
&gt; apply here but.....With the engine at as low of an idle as it can run
&gt; (not below standard idle speed) you take some starter fluid and spray
&gt; shots at all joints (manifold end to heat, center section to manifold,
&gt; etc) If the engine speed increases, the it appears you have a vacuum
&gt; leak (the starter fluid richens the mixture). Some people use WD-40, but
&gt; for whatever reason I never had much luck with it. Either way it works
&gt; very well, just keep in mind that you ARE spraying a very flammable
&gt; fluid on a hot engine.
