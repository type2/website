X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

The first time (in 89) I had the tank on my 78 filled I brought it to an RV
place my father-in-law recommended. They did the safety inspection,
discovered a leak in the diaphragm of the stock single-stage regulator, and
suggested replacing it with a double stage regulator, which I had them do
since it was supposed to be safer. They refilled it a second time after
asking &quot;have you been here before?&quot;.

I finally (after almost 7 years) needed to refill the tank locally recently
and I thought the tank looked dubious because of the surface rust. I had
heard of people having problems with &quot;safety inspections&quot; on the list and I
had long ago lost the little paper tag the RV place had attached to the
tank assembly. I removed the tank and wire brushed the tank and sprayed it
silver. When i got it refilled at a gas station the attendant asked me how
old it was and I was able to tell him 22 years, but I had it serviced by an
RV place and they replaced the regulator.

Wasn't sure if he was making conversation since it was attached to a near
antique vehicle or this was a casual check for safety that I might have
failed with the wrong answer. This being NH a lot of things are pretty
casual (no emissions in most of it, no title needed for vehicles 10 years
old or more) while other states are downright anal. YMMV. In any case I
don't think it would hurt to have someone pressure test the system.
