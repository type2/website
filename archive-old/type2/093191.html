Subject: Re: [T2] Starter problem


&gt;My starter likes to stop working after it gets hot on long highway runs.
&gt;This does not happen all the time, only intermediately. I have in the past
&gt;jumped the starter with a piece of wire under the bus and then it started
&gt;fine. I am wondering if the starter has a bad spot on the winding and I'm
&gt;just getting lucky that it only finds this spot on trips or if some thing is
&gt;getting hot (starter or selinoid) and causing this. I am leaning towards the
&gt;heat for I have let it sit overnight after getting home with it not starting
&gt;and then in the morning it starts fine. Does this sound familiar to anyone?
&gt;Any advice would be great...Thanks...Dana

Exactly describes my situation with my '72 Beetle. I added a hot start 
relay (Muir's book has the explanation and I'm sure it is all over the 
web). and that cured most of the problems on my Bus. It only failed once.

I never crawl under my VW for this problem - we just roll start it.
