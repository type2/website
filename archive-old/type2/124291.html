Subject: Re:camper floor

Neal,
    A couple of years ago I replaced the floor in our 71 camper.
After removing all of the interior in the back of the bus I cleaned up
and repainted the metal floor.  There were a few small spots of rust
which I paid special attention to.  Then I put down a layer of 11/32
( 3/8ths is almost the same) exterior plywood.  The floor you need to
cover is bigger than 48 inches so this layer will have to be made in 2
pieces.  Next came a layer of 1/8th inch masonite.  Again it had to be
made in 2 pieces.  I made this layer so that the seam is perpendicular
to the seam in the bottom layer.  I glued and screwed the 2nd layer to
the first.  Then I glued down some commercial grade 12 inch by 12 inch
tiles to finish the floor.  This combination of materials gave me the
proper height for under the various pieces of furniture and makes a
good solid floor to stand and wak on.
