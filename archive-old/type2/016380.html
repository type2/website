Subject: VW mechanic in Nashville?

I have a friend with an 84 Westy.  He's not on this list and considers
himself to be mechanically challenged :-)   He's moving to Nashville TN in
December and would like to know of a reliable VW mechanic in that area.  A
gas tank replacement is apparently in the near future, among other things.

If you can recommend a good VW mechanic there, please post details to
gaynor.wild_at_murraystate_dot_edu.  Many thanks, all.
