Unfortunately, my kids refuse to eat that stuff...I don't blame them.

Our local Disney store didn't have _any_ Fillmore's in any form.  In fact,
they have pretty much cleared the Cars stuff out in favor of Pirates

No Fillmore for me, I'm afraid.

The instruction sheet that comes with the McDonalds Fillmore was on TS.
It was rather funny all by itself.
