Subject: Help..engine tin

Could someone please help me source a piece of engine tin for my 1974
bus? It is the warm air duct ( front left, drivers side). It sits
vertically between the flat tin that connects to the bottom of the sump
and the cylinder cover plate, it is just opposite the oil cooler duct.
The part # is 021-119-361 and my bus will be down until I am able to
locate another one, as I am all too aware of the cooling problems this
can cause. If someone has a used tin or might know the location of a
source for this part please e-mail me it would be greatly appreciated
it. Thanks in advance
