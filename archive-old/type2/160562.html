Well, two, actually...

The big one is... anyone have a spare?

The second is:  which polarity should I choose in connecting it?

The first is only semi-seriouse as I do have one, however corroded it may
be.  I will *eventually* scrape/sand/file enough of the corrosion off of it
to get good contact with the bulb.  Once that's done and I go to reconnect
it, I am trying to think whether there would be any advantage to making one
or the other contact the ground.  As connected the lamp base contact was
positive and the collar was ground.  the base contact is bronze, however and
the collar is steel.  Over time the steel had corroded
&lt;euphemism&gt;badly&lt;/euphemism&gt;!  I am wondering if, from an electronegativity
respect, I would get less corrosion by reversing the leads.  Any physicists
(George?) want to take a stab at whether i would get more or less corrosion
of the steel if it were on the positive lead?

Steve
