You all are awsome - you Rock! I got my lights working
perfectly. Now for the sliding door. I need to take
the guard off. I see the two screws at either end, but
after that how is it attatched? Won't seem to come
loose. Do I need to remove it to put the slide block
back in? Thanks again for all your help...
