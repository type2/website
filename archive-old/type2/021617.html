1. Yes, you can replace the fuel line throughout your engine and to/from
your tank, and it's recommended!  Make sure that you get HIGH PRESSURE
FI hose.

2. NO!  DO NOT HOTWIRE THE FUEL PUMP!  The pump was specifically set up
so that when there is no airflow through the engine, the pump stops. 
Imagine if you have an engine fire and you turn off the key, engine
stops, and the pump is still flowing.  You'll just be feeding the
fire!!!

If you're going to be messing with gas, DON'T let it spray all over the
place, ESPECIALLY in the engine compartment.  There is huge potential
for a spark and KAZAAAAM.  Plus, you have a full gas tank a foot away. 
Not a smart idea.

3. Wow, I would NEVER want to get shocked by that thing.. hehehe.. it's
pretty nasty.  The easier way to test for spark is either with a special
tool or you just hook up a spark plug to a cable and touch the outside
of the spark plug to the case, crank, and see if you get a good spark.


If I were you, I'd go through the bentley manual thoroughly and also go
through the Bosch l-jetronic FI manual thoroughly.  They are good for
diagnosing every starting problem.  And please, be safe and keep a fire
extinguisher handy cuz it sounds like you're setting yourself up for
some nasty fire hazards!
