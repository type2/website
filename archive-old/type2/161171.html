Subject: parts swap

Due to an engine rebuilder  misplacing most of my engine accessories I
need to come up with some replacement items. I have a 80 westy 2 liter
air-cooled, I have a friend who is parting out a 78 westy with  the same
type of motor. Does anyone know whether the following parts are
interchangeable. From the 78 to the 80

-Engine wiring harness (computer to sensors , injectors etc....)
-Clutch, pressure plate
-Air intake bellows ( goes between air flow sensor and throttle valve)

By the way if anyone out there is considering doing business with  a
company called &quot;Just Vee Dubs&quot; contact me first for a reference.
