hello.  i saw a bus broken down in the turning lane of Harrison Ave.
in Cary, NC on my way home from work last friday.  i stopped at the
vehicle to see if i could help, but no one was around.

when i pulled up behind the vehicle i could see what i believed 
to be the left side axle hanging down almost to the pavement. ouch.

anywho, if that person is on this list &amp; is in need of any
further assistance i'd be glad to help.

the vehicle looked to be a '77-'79 sage green westy &amp; the 
liscence plate said &quot;POPS&amp;MAC&quot;.
