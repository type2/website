Subject: Re: [T2] '78 won't turn over - Ft Belvoir VA

One thing you said makes me think it may be the ground strap from the  
starter to the
tranny.  You said the starter was turning sluggishly even before.  If the  
battery is
strong, this could indicate a poor connection, either from battery to  
starter or from
starter to ground.

If you get a small spark when you touch the negative cable to the negative  
battery
post but you don't get a similar spark when touching a good ground spot on  
the bus,
this may be further evidence of a poor ground connection.

Yes, if you can jump start it no reason no reason why you shouldn't be  
able to drive it.

Cheers,

John
