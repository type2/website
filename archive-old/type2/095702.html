Subject: Re:  [T2] Hot Start Relay Question 

You can't get &quot;Too Much&quot; juice to the starter. I'm pretty sure the clicking
is due to the fact that many automotive relays require a lot of current to
operate, so if the the starter/solenoid draws a lot of current, it could
cause the relay to open, which would stop the starter, which would make more
current available for the relay, which would close again, which would run
the starter, which would take current away from the relay, which would
open....you get the idea, a vicious circle, happening very fast. I suspect
the rapid cycling of the starter/solenoid would be hard on the starter, but
probably not too hard on the flywheel.

My '77 developed difficulty starting when the starter was hot, so I
installed a hot start relay.  I then had clicking like you describe, but the
starter seemed to work OK.  Eventually the solenoid continued to deteriorate
to the point where it would only start when the engine was completely cold,
even with the relay.  A used solenoid/starter fixed both the clicking and
the hard start problem.  I now feel that the relay will allow you to extend
the service life of a solenoid, but not forever.  If my clicking ever comes
back I might try a lower-current relay, or I might just use that as an
indicator to buy a new solenoid.
