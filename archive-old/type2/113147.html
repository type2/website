Check your timing.  A VW engine is designed to run on 87 octane regular gas.

&gt;Question:  When the engine was reinstalled a new throw out bearing was
&gt;installed.  It makes an ungodly racket with the clutch pushed in.  Was
&gt;told it will &quot;go away&quot; but it's making me insane.  Should I press to have
&gt;the engine removed and the thing greased up?
&gt;
Could be that they installed the wrong t/o bearing.  A new bearing will 
not make noise and it will not quiet down with use.  There is no way to 
grease it.  Take it back and insist that it be repaired properly.  If 
it's making noise, something's wrong.
