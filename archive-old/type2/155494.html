Subject: The Guac's First Trip

Wanting to get out of the house as a family for a while, we decided just to
go for a drive. This was a great chance to put the Guac through its paces,
and get to know how it does on longer trips.

We got on I-25 and headed North. No destination in mind, just driving.
Enjoying the quieter bus now that I put the tar pads on the doors and
installed my door panels on the fronts. Coming up on I-70 I realized I've
never driven West on that highway, so West it is! I pull off for a potty
break for the women and realized we were on the &quot;Lariat Loop&quot; (
http://lariatloop_dot_org/) where Buffalo Bill's grave is. So up we went.
Checked out the grave and gift shop (museum was closed), and finished the
loop and headed home.

Just a few hours, but lots of mountain climbing and highway time mixed
together. A great test for The Guac. Only one issue arose, and I'm gonna
have to do some looking to find out why: A rattling huffing sound during
downhill deceleration. Kinda like an exhaust leak popcorn, but it was coming
through the muffler. And a sharp rattle along with it. I'm thinking it's a
vacuum leak somewhere. I know we didn't replace all the elbows and such when
we did the top end refresh on this engine so that's where I'll start
looking.

I don't suppose anybody sells a complete kit of elbows and seals and such
for 78 fuel injection? That would make my life much easier.=)
