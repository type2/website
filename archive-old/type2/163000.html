James our encyclopaedic man

&gt;Just to remind you that VW stopped the oil filter boycott when the 
&gt;Bay Window started using the Type 4 based engine in 1972 (at least 
&gt;here in the USA).

	My '73 has the 1600 DP motor; I've had nothing to do with, 
nor hardly read anything about, those noo-fangled motors that take 
less headroom.  I even had the impression their fan was axial  - 
corrected by one of our Canuck experts.
	So the 'reminding' is only in your courtly manners!
	Glad to hear VW finally admitted a proper oil filter is worthwhile.


&gt;   From then, a spin-on oil filter was standard equipment.  But yes, 
&gt;the oil should be drained hot, even with an oil filter equipped 
&gt;engine.
&gt;;-)

	Glad we have total agreement.
	The same type of filter can be substituted, where there's 
room, by a larger one.  For instance, the mighty Sierra motor of the 
R8, R10 etc can take the larger filter for a Ford Transit, and 
cruising temp is lower with this bigger, if still inefficient, 
radiator of heat from the oil.
	BTW the tiny volume of oil in the 'vertical' motors such as 
the 1600 (2.5 L) makes it economic to change it more often than one 
would, all else being equal, for motors that have more oil in them 
e.g the 1972 1700 T4 with filter (3.5L).  Oil is cheaper than 
bearings.
