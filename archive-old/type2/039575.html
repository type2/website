Subject: New---Help!!! bus won't move forward!!!

hello all again....
    here is some additional info that i may have left out that may be
helpful.....my bus is a 1970 with a 1600 in it, manual tranny, single 34 pic
3 carb, boch distributor and i just put in a new fuel pump, and electronic
ignition (pertronics ignitor) about a month ago.
thanks again
ericd
p.s. the bus is back to stalling out when i move forward again, but, even in
neutral it still has a hard time staying alive.....go figure.....




&gt;Hello all:
&gt;   here are the new happenings with my bus, this morning i went to start it
&gt;and it turned over and ran in forwards and reverse but it was struggling to
&gt;stay alive even in neutral, could this be something to do with the carbs???
&gt;being that i could shift it now??? this whole thing still has me scratching
&gt;my head.....
&gt;thanks in advance
