Subject: First Timer's Engine Removal Question

I've got a 79' 2.0L Westy which needs a new clutch. I'm in the process of 
dropping the engine now. My question is, are there some screws  underneath 
the bus that hold the front engine tin (that goes from one side to the 
other) to the motor? I've got all the screws I can see off the top and 
bottom, and the damn thing stil won't come off. It feels like it's still 
connected somewhere on the driver's side, but I can't tell for sure. If I 
can get that off, I should be in the clear (right?). Anything else a first 
timer like myself should pay close attention too?

Thanks In Advance
Jared
