Okay,
    So Ronnie (Old Volks Arizona) called me this morning to talk to me
about getting a motor.  He has two in stock but the only one available
got hit while shipping and a generator stand stud was broken and two of
the pushrod tubes were damaged and will need to be replaced.
    Ronnie said he will fix all of those things and even give me a
discount, but I am still worried about any long term damage that may
have occured.  Are my fears unfounded?  What should I do?

Greg
