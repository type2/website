Left Costa Mesa on Thursday afternoon for Jerome, AZ.  I-10 east to
Phoenix and I-17 north to the Prescott area.  Rain after crossing the
state line.  The smell of rain in the desert reminds me of that light
green color of 60's VW beetles, one of my favorite paint colors.

The thunder, lightning and rain continue as I try and sleep in a KMart
parking lot.  Flagstaff got over 1 inch of rain that night.  Jerome's
Gold King Mine parking lot had 1-2&quot; deep puddles.  I was greeted by
John and his '58 Binz, then found a spot of dry land to park on.  By
dusk there were just over a hundred busses parked and the rain stopped.

After dinner, I took a walk up to an overlook to see the red rocks of
Sedona in the distance.  Then I saw Bradley's bus drive up the hill to
the lot.  Red wine and white with silver windows.  We strung up a tarp
between us for shade and rain shelter. 

Saturday more buses arrived.  People of all shapes, ages and persuasions.
We all had one thing in common - the love of the VW transporter.  It was
cool to see everyone get along.  At eleven, a caravan arrived from PHX.
The group had assembled.

I met several list subscribers for the first time.  It was neat to see
the faces behind all these little phosphor dots.  To break the ice, I
wore my Vanagon_at_lenti tee-shirt.  David and Dyer also had their olde list
shirts on.  Several folks did not understand, but liked the shirt, so I
directed them to the Type2_dot_com resource.  Marty was there from FL - what
a long haul!!   In the night there were campfires and a drum circle.  It
reminded me of some of the parking lot jams after a GD concert.

The memorable busses for me were a '51 deluxe (orange busses are cool :)
and a '52 Kombi.  There was a stretched &quot;limo&quot; splitty bus with a V8
engine whose owner was pouring some great tequila shooters. There were
plenty of VW tents that were pitched aside, behind and on top of busses.
It was an awesome display, not like a car show.  The busses actually were
in use and not &quot;posing&quot; for the camera.  Every gen of transporter was
present, from barndoor to eurovan.

Slow drag races.  The point is to go as slow as possible in first gear.
No brakes or clutch allowed.  I guess you lower the idle and load up
with lots of cargo to be competitive.  It was a crack-up.

Sunday morning I hit it back to L.A. taking the scenic route.  From
Jerome I drove through the mountains to Prescott, Wickenburg and
Quartzsite.  It was a pleasant, leasurely drive and I enjoyed the land
and flora. It slowly transformed from a pine forest to desert scrub.
The opressive heat of the Mojave desert from Blythe to Indio was fierce.
I had to back off the throttle and run at 55-60 mph.  The rest of the
slug-slab run back home was at 65 mph and without incident.
