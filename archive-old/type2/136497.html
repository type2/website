Subject: Re: [T2] Gas Pedal appears bent or off track

Rust, as in you don't have any place for
the pedal to hang onto.  My solution, 
admittedly non-stock, is to screw a large
longtailed hinge go the floor and to the 
pedal and just live with it.  It beats
driving home at an idle, which, of course,
I got to do when first this broke.
