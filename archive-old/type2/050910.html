Subject: [T2] fan seal replacement procedure

i was given this procedure for replacing the fan seal on a 2000cc, i'm
posting this to help others and also to seek any addendum's to it. the
source is VERY reliable.

&quot;you can fix the rear seal (fan seal) without removing the engine. you
need to remove the 3 allen type bolts (after you remove the fan belt)
carefully pry on both sides of
the fan to pull it out straight. Then remove the crank bolt that holds
the fan hub on the crank. sometimes light tapping with a hammer will
remove the hub but if you can
get hold of a puller a small 3 jaw type yo can pull it off (it is a
tappered fit on crank). Once off go ahead a pull seal out and replace
with new one (also make sure
o'ring on fan hub inside part to crank is in good condition). any doubts
replace it this also holds oil back. good luck!!!!!!!!&quot;

hope others find this useful
