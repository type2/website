Subject: Re: [T2] once upon a pre-owned tuna can

Two Honda's and a bus.  My wife called our driveway &quot;The Axis&quot;
Bus = Fun journey, Honda = Fun destination.   4 kids has a major
impact on that equation.

Trading a bus means same show different owner.  Junking seems sacralige.

I would hope the Harley to Suziki guy wouldn't get penalized more than
not getting the invite to fix-it days or poker runs..

Now the Harley guy that hacked his bike AND bus to make a
pancake-powered trike...

Catch ya on the Type-2 talk list!
