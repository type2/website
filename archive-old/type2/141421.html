Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Painting / Cleaning the Undercarriage

&gt; I'm in the process of doing this very job. The process I am using is to
&gt; wash off dirt, remove any rust back to bare metal (the underside is
&gt; generally in good condition), coat with fish oil, rust proof primer and
&gt; finally bituminous paint (for sound deadening).

Alright!  I didn't want to mention this.. but I have a &quot;survivor&quot; '57 Beetle,,
that has many many miles on it ,, year round in Ontario,  Canada, where we
pickle the roads pretty well..

The PO coated it with &quot;Fish Oil&quot; ...

I have had it for 10+ years and basically just stored it... the &quot;Fish Oil&quot; has
started to peel as it is drying out ... and under neath it is shinny black floor
paint,, like it was fresh from the factory!

What is &quot;Fish Oil&quot;  ?   How can you paint over it....?
