Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Pressure Relief Tool

&gt;From: Richard Atwell

&gt;It's not quite the same. What you have is a drag link socket and you need 
&gt;to modify it to fit the profile of the oil pressure relief cap so it's like 
&gt;the original VW/Porsche tool.

Thanks Richard I know you have posted this before I remember the pics. That 
was what I was looking for. Now I know what they are called as well.

Thanks again.
