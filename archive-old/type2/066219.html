Subject: Re: Westy Fridge Repair/ Used Fridge for Sale

&gt;I have decided to bite the bullet and have my refrigerator looked at by 
&gt;the local RV place.  The guy said he would take a look at for free and had
&gt;worked with Dometic before.  Has anyone actually had one repaired, and
&gt;how much were the costs?  

&gt;H. Steve if your reading I'll ask if a conversion exists to turn it into 
&gt;propane fridge.

When I was trying to get the Dometic fridge in my '77 working, I got a lot 
of free tech support from the manufacturer at (800) 544-4881. But if the 
local RV place will check it for free, that may not be a bad idea. 

I don't believe there is any easy way to convert a DC Westy fridge to work 
on propane.  However, if anyone is interested, I do have a used Dometic 
AC/DC/propane fridge that I salvaged out of a Bus.  It is not factory 
original, and will not fit in place of the factory fridge (slightly too 
big); you would have to adapt a spot for it.  It is a nicer fridge than 
even the Vanagon Westy fridge, though; even has a built-in Freezer section. 
I'm currently using it in my garage on AC power to keep beer cold.  Came 
with all paperwork, and the original receipt for about $600 new.  Would 
sell for $250ish.
