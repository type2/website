&gt;Unofficially, I have always been under the impression that the corner
&gt;windows were last seen in the 1963 model year. 21 windows were
&gt;&lt;unfortunately&gt; the *(US) max starting in '64. So much for the '66 23 that
&gt;was recently FS.

I myself always thought this was the case (and still do).  BUT there is a VW
*guru* at home in 
Aus (he owns the only barn door deluxe I've ever seen - at least until I go
and
check out Thom's) who blindly swears that the extra two rear corner windows
were available as a factory *option* from 64-67.  He even gets *quite* excited
about it - would anyone care to comment?
