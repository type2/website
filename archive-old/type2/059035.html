Subject: No Rear Engine Hanger

I bought a used 72 Sportsmobile,it had a 1600 type 1 moter bolted in and no rear engine hanger.I plan to replace the current moter with a 1600 dp type 1 but am a little worried about the rear engine hanger being omitted what can happen,and has anyone had anything bad happen by not useing the rear hanger.
Thanks,Tim Linke
