re: rear main bearing

Does it seat firmly in each half of the case?? width of seat should be near 
perfect. If the bearing can be pushed back and forth along the axis of 
crank just a bit, then make sure you seat the bearing as far toward the fan 
end as it will go. Frankly, if the bearing will move at all back and forth, 
you have a tolerance issue, either the bearing is out of spec or the web of 
the bearing saddle is worn. If the case is worn, it proves your machinist 
did not validate all specs before turning on the machines.

For the DIY'er I always advise that you pay for assembly by the machinist 
who cuts the parts. Verify the end play upon first opportunity. If it is 
not right, let the machinist fix it. Make sure initially that the machinist 
is hired for an engine that is within new spec in all regards as his duty 
of performance. Put it in writing. If he won't sign to that, find one who 
will. Otherwise, you get what you got. Lots of wasted time/money. All your 
questions on this matter should be directed toward the suppliers of the 
parts and machine work first. Only following their advise will keep you 
covered as far as their obligations are concerned.

&gt; &gt; the case open, attached the flywheel and had endplay!?!?!  I don't get
&gt; &gt; it.
