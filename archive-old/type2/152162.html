&gt; I just bought a 1977 automatic Westfalia.  The engine was removed

&gt; The only two ways I figured to check the compression on an automatic was
&gt; to reinstall the engine in the vehicle or install a flywheel on the
&gt; engine and then use my bellhousing and starter that I have to test
&gt; engines out of a vehicle.

put the torque converter onto the flexplate and attach the bellhousing and
use an auto tranny starter... should work

YMMV
