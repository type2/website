Hey there Dave,

Aren't you glad you didn't goto carbs! 

&gt; Seems to run ok, I need to work on idle a little bit.
&gt; No oil smoke, but some black (I'm running too rich smoke).

Check the temp sensor near the #3 cyl. Make sure it's plugged in and
that it is within specs (check hot and cold - ohm measurements is in
the bentley/haynes or the archives).

&gt; Now for a question...it sounds like it needs a serious valve
&gt; adjustment...but it's supposed to be hydraulic lifters.

You can check the engine code (at the case halfs near the oil
breather). Don't trust the # on the fan housing, they get swapped
sometimes. 78 and 79 bays come w/ hydralic lifters stock. Check the 
engine code #'s for sure on this page: 

http://www.type2_dot_com/bartnik/enginecodes.htm

Hopefully someone didn't put solids lifters in a hydr. case, or
you'll hafta find another way to check the lifter type. Someone
(Karl?) mentioned something about checking the pushrods or something
but as you can tell by this sentence I have no idea what that
something is.

&gt; Is it possible that they are gunked up and not &quot;pumping up&quot; or is
&gt; there any adjustment that needs to be performed. 

If the bus has been sitting it may take many miles for the lifters to
finally pump-up. When I start my bus up after it's winter nap, they
make a racket for awhile. John Anderson has a great writeup (in the
library) on hydr. lifters here: 

http://www.type2_dot_com/library/engineg/hydral.htm

&gt; I haven't pulled the valve
&gt; covers off yet, but will, cause the pushrod tubes are doing some
&gt; serious leaking.  I have replacement o rings for that.

From the library and Bartno tek pages:

Damn, I love http://www.type2_dot_com

I missed Campers on Cape Cod/Transporter Fest, so I hope there are
some good trip reports/write-ups.
