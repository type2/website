&gt; 2) I am in the process of removing my starter, does anyone know where the 
&gt; 2nd screw is that I need to take off to remove the starter? I got the 
&gt; electrical part off as well as the screw under the bus. But I cant find the 
&gt; 2nd screw.

Well the starter isn't held on by screws.  On the bottom the starter is
held on by a nut on a stud which you found and removed.  On the top. the
starter is held in by a nut and bolt which also happens to be one of the
bolts that holds the engine to the transmission.  The nut can only be
accessed from inside the engine compartment.  This is between the fan
housing and the firewall on your Bus.  You can't really see the nut, you
will have to feel for it.  It's 17mm and you will only be able to get a
wrench on it.  You can't undo it from underneath because the bolt doesn't
have a regular bolt head, it's got a half-moon shaped head that fits into
a notch on the starter.  This is to keep the bolt from turning while you
loosen the nut.  This will be tricky to do for a first timer but before
you know it you'll be expert on pulling and installing starters.

&gt; 
&gt; 3) There is a part that looks like a black can that has a few latches on it. 
&gt; It has two vents that face towards the back of the bus. It also has a tube 
&gt; that runs to the top of my carburetor. Can anyone tell me what this is? I 
&gt; would think it was the air filter but it has quite a bit of oil inside.
&gt; 

This is indeed the air filter.  The old Volkswagens have an oil-bath air
filter which is actually a bit of a better filter than paper element air
cleaners, however they are a bit more expensive to manufacture (lots of 
metal and horsehair) and of
course messy to service.  You want to change the oil inside the air
cleaner when you do a regular engine oil change.  It holds about 1/2 quart
of oil as I recall.

&gt; 4) Last question for now. Newt to the oil cap there is a pipe that runs down 
&gt; under the bus to nowhere the other part of the tube attaches to a hose that 
&gt; goes to the part described in question number 3.
&gt; 

This is the crankcase breather and road draft tube.  The part that goes
into the air cleaner vents crankcase fumes into the air cleaner to be
burned by the engine, rather than releasing them into the atmosphere.  The
tube that goes down to nowhere is the road draft tube.  This lets oily
funk from the crankcase breather drain out.  Later vehicles don't have a
road draft tube because it's not good to let oily stuff out of the engine
and onto the ground.
