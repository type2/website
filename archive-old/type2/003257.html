Subject: [T2] 70 Bus Parts into a 69


&gt; Hi all.
&gt;
&gt; I just bought a 70 Westy to get many much needed parts for my 69.
&gt; Namely an engine and trans.
&gt;
&gt; The 70 has the original 1600SP engine, rebuilt to stock but external oil
&gt; cooler mounted on the rear qurter panel.
&gt;
&gt; I want to put this engine and the tranny into my 69, but put a doghouse
oil
&gt; cooler on instead.
&gt;
&gt; First, is this even possible (I hope so) second, where can I get the
&gt; doghouse parts (I need the cooler, tin and shroud?) new vs. bone yard.
&gt; Should they be for the engine year or the body year?
&gt;
Go for bone yard, good straight VW tin, its a direct replacement.From memory
what you'll need is the oil cooler, the adapter it sits on, the fan housing
and the bits that mount on the back. The hard part is finding the one year
only tin that mounts on the front of the engine. Then its just remove and
replace
&gt;
&gt; Also, it looks like the driver's side pushrod tubes are leaking at the
valve
&gt; cover. Can I reseal these without too much trouble? Which book is best for
&gt; the job: Muir/ Bentley/ Clymer? Any tips not listed in the books?
&gt;

Pull the heads so you can 'completely' clean them. Buy new tubes, their
cheap, streach 'em a little bit, dab a little bit of yamabond 4 on the
mateing surface of each end and reassemble and torgue to spec.
Tom Wilson's book 'how to rebuild your vw aircooled engine' best of the
bunch.
just my .05 worth
&gt; If there's anyone with the energy to tackle these questions, I'd much
&gt; appreciate it.
&gt;
