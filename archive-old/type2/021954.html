Subject: RE: [T2] New to list / help with windshield wipers

Just following up on this topic from last week.  I talked with
Joe at bustedbus_dot_com.  I can convert to the more common wiper
setup by swapping out the 68 wiper shaft for the shaft kit from
a newer (69-72) model.  Then I can mount the new arms, etc.  
Next, I'll get to figure out what's up with the motor, wiring,
etc.  

With 4-6&quot; of snow hitting my area tonight, my next project
will have to be getting the heating system working.  Looks
pretty straightforward, just need to order more parts....

Thanks for everyone's help on the wiper arms...
Brad Baker

&gt; Hi-
&gt;   I recently bought a 68 Westy.  This is my first bus, so I've been
learning
&gt; a lot
&gt; by just lurking in the background and reading everything on the list.
&gt; Anyway,
&gt; my current problem is a lack of wiper arms for my bus.  I have the motor,
&gt; linkage, etc, but no arms.  I've looked around online and at a couple
stores
&gt; and have been unable to find replacement arms.  I've been told they are
&gt; next to impossible to find.  Any suggestions out there?  Can I mount arms
&gt; from a different year bus (or any other car) to my wiper shafts?  Will I
&gt; need to
&gt; convert the entire assembly to another model year?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for any help,
&gt; Brad Baker
