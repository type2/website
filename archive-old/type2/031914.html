John:

I would guess (and it's only a guess) that &quot;deck height&quot; is not something 
that you'd ordinarily find in a manual.  After all, you take new P&amp;C's, 
new rods, new heads, and then bolt them all together, and what could 
possibly go wrong, right?

I mean, it's not like a crankshaft, where the &quot;engineer approved&quot; way of 
rehabing it is to grind the journals; since there are &quot;standard&quot; 
undersizes for reground journals, these might reasonably be listed in a 
comprehesive repair manual.  (BTW, the Haynes has the journal sizes 
wrong and they're not even mentioned in the Bentely.  So much for manuals.)

But there's no factory-approved &quot;shorter&quot; or &quot;longer&quot; rods, pistons, etc. 
so I would think &quot;deck height&quot; would be one of those obscure measurements 
that might be part of factory blueprints, and not show up anywhere else.

But the truth is that cases get reconditioned, replacement rods, pistons, 
etc. get made more-or-less in spec, and at some point the concept of deck 
height becomes important to a rebuilder.  (And, maybe, it becomes 
important sooner to a hot-rodder who has to build to tighter tolerances.)

Looking through the archives I see .035&quot; mentioned as the actual deck 
height of Mark Stephens &quot;zero deck height&quot; engines, but it looks like 
other modifications get made to the head in order to keep compression 
ratios reasonable.

If you're down at the .035&quot; range then something's going on to get it 
there - like a machined case or too-long rods - and I would probably opt 
to bump it back out to the middle of the range Wilson specifies.

If you do manage to find an honest-to-god factory spec for deck height 
please let me know as I'm currently rebuilding a couple of 2.0l engines.

&gt; Regarding the deck height on the 2.0 Vanagon, I recently put new pistons
&gt; and cylinders on what appears to be an previously unmachined case and
&gt; stock crank and had a deck height in the 0.035&quot; range. I had planned to
&gt; leave the gaskets out at the cylinder bases, but with a deck height of
&gt; only 0.025&quot; with this configuration, I thought better to include them and
&gt; bump it up to 0.034 to 0.035&quot;.   Wilson mentions 0.040&quot; being the
&gt; minimum, but then again there is several comments that do to apply to
&gt; Type IV's especially late Type IV's (oil baffles, bolting in oil pick-up
&gt; tube, etc).
&gt; 
&gt; I searched the Bently and Haynes manuals, but no mention of deck height. 
&gt; I called the VW shop that put my crank together (30 years with an
&gt; unlisted tel no. - they must be pretty good!) and when I told him I had
&gt; 0.035&quot;, he said &quot;Your there now you can have a beer!&quot; So based on the
&gt; opinion of one, 0.035&quot; seems fine, but
