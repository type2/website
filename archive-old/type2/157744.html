Subject: Re: [T2] Cold Start Valve and TTS

I wish I could give you a better answer than this... I
had trouble with the thermo time switch and pulled
everything apart &amp; replaced it with a known good one
and that didn't work either, so next winter I added a
switch on the dashboard to run the CSS on demand.

If you're a neighbor of Don's then I'm sure you got it
cold enough - it needs to be below 50 degrees to work
- seems to me it had to be below like 45 for mine.

You're headed in the right direction though - thermo
time switch operates the cold start injector and the
air bypass valve.

Another enrichening device would be to add resistance
to the head temp sensor. If you had a switch that
would open that circuit for a second while cranking it
would give infinite resistance to a circuit that wants
about 2400 ohms at room temp. It should only take a
second while cranking. If you want to tweak this, drop
me a line as I have a lot of experience with it.

 I have been trying to determine the reason why I am
 not getting the rapid start that I should in my '76.
 
 After many posts on IAC, I decided to ask you folks.
 So far, I can get her to start if I turn the engine
 and mess with the AFM wiper, but I have been told
 that
 the problem may very well be with the cold start
 valve
 or thermo time switch.
 
 I have tested both independently and got a spray
 from
 the CSV as well as a VERY faint light from the TTS.
 When I plugged them in together and tested them the
 next day (make sure the TTS was cold) I could not
 get
 the CSV to spray. 
 
 Does this mean my TTS is done?
