Subject: engine storage ? and misc. ramblings

 Looks like no bussin' for me this year since the motor aint in other, stuff
needs work before I can drive it and its getting too cold to work outside
and I spent much to much time getting vicarious kicks off this list ;-)
Vdubs are not my daily drivers anymore, I've owned at least a dozen assorted
VW's over the years... favorite... '63 bug Turkis color with off white
interior... but I got to tell you at this stage of the game when you can get
211k out of a tercel before I let it rest, IMHO its hard to resist the
oriental stuff for everyday. So what knowledge skill and extra bucks I had
went into the '78 westy rejuvination which I had driven for three years
before undertaking major work. Its a plaything for me now we love to camp in
it THE BEST! way to go. And its a good intergenerational ice breaker too.
When my 17 year old niece introduced me to her friends I was the uncle with
the way cool VW poptop. Yeah buses are great and mine will be on the road in
the spring blah, blah, blah :-)

I have a question... I purchased a rebuilt long block installed all the
other parts dist carb etc the tin and exchangers are on it is more or less
ready to be installed in the bus. Should I leave the engine out of the bus
with just the assembly grease in it and rotate the engine periodically.. do
the same but add oil and/or fog the engine.. or should I install it and oil
it and turn it over once in a while or should I try and run the engine even
though its undrivable and I can't get any break in miles on it. I live up
north and if I leave engine out it would be stored in unheated space or with
some effort, if recommended, in a heated space. The engine has already been
sitting for five months and it will be another five or so before its warm
enough to work on it again. 

Thanks

Len
