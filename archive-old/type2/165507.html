Subject: Re: [T2] Torsion Bar Adjustment

&gt; I had the torsion bar adjusted on my '74 Bay to raise the saggy rear end.  So
&gt; now the rear tire is about level or flush with the wheel well (body) of the
&gt; bus.  Before the body sat several inches below the top of the rear tires.  I
&gt; have a situation now where the spring plate knocks against the stopper over
&gt; minor bumps.  The spring plate rests less than 1/4 inch above the stopper.  As
&gt; I understand the recent adjustment was made to both the inner and outer
&gt; splines one position.  Any suggestions on how to re-adjust the torsion bar so
&gt; that the spring plate does not knock against the stopper?

The adjustment is too high, so whoever adjusted it didn't do it correctly.

My best advice is to look at the Bentley manual and do a search of the
archives.  Lots of good info there.

Do not wait too long to do this.  Running the rear end too high is hard on
the CVs and CV boots.
