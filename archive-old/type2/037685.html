Subject: Re: yards

I went to Ecology in Wilmington (SoCal) yesterday and today. They've got
a pretty good number of buses but they turn over pretty quickly. They
have practically no Bugs (Pick Your Part usually has lots of Bugs and no buses.)

NOTE OF INTEREST TO ANY SoCal ADVENTUREWAGEN OWNERS: There's a 1973 AW
3/4 top at the Ecology in Wilmington. I snagged some interior parts, but
there are the overhead bins (front and back), large side drop table, and
bed frame. Also, the engine is lying on the ground just behind it.

I didn't find any type4 heat shields lying about. It looks to me like
the early bays with the type1 engines have that built-in apron that
looks like it serves as a shield, though. I'm wondering what other
variations there might be depending on engine size, etc., over the years?
