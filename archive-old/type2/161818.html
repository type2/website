&gt; Hi
&gt; 
&gt; I have just failed the local test on a leaking exhaust manifold (and
&gt; other things but I fixed them - don't mention the 009).
&gt; I have changed it twice - still leaks - read the archive, its the file
&gt; it flat thing so I will pull it again at the wekend and do it right this
&gt; time.
&gt; 
&gt; While the heater box was off I noticed the studs were kind of loose, so
&gt; I tightned them up, then they were to short, so I had to let them out
&gt; again.  Is this OK or do I need to go in search of new longer studs??

The correct studs are 53mm long:

We have all the exhaust studs in stock for aircooled engines, most are
genuine VW, some are OE equivalent. The genuine 8mm VW studs for early type
4 year are now obsolete from VW, so we now have a stud used on Porsche which
is very good quality, it is 1.5mm shorter but will work well. We have some
of the genuine VW ones left, but only a handful.

You need to make sure to use hardened studs with rolled threads. The way to
tell if they are the right kind is by looking at the ends, the good ones
always have a stamping there, either a mark (like a diamond shape or other
simple shape) or a letter.
