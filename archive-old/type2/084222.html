Subject: Re: [T2] Found a vacuum leak but...

Thanks for the advise Karl. To clarify, I have a 1975 bus, using 1975 fuel
injection, 78 2 liter engine and distributor. The 78 single vacuum dizzy is
better than the 009 that came with the original bus. Is there an advantage to the
dual vac dizzy?
I stand corrected on my terminology, InHg it is.
I'll Check those vacuum ports Wednesday eve.
Thanks for the help
Tom

&gt;
&gt; Vacuum is measured in Inches of Mercury, NOT psi. PSI is pressure.
&gt;
&gt; what should my manifold vacuum be at idle? I am
&gt; &gt; getting 14 PSI on my gauge connected with a T into the vacuum port that
&gt; &gt; supplies the fuel regulator.
&gt;
&gt; 14 inches of HG sounds like you have retarded timing.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; It's connected to the port facing the rear of the bus on the
&gt; &gt; throttle body.
&gt;
&gt; Is the nipple pointing to the rear bumper?
&gt;

Yes towards the rear bumper.

&gt; You say you have the 75 set-up. That means you are using the 75/early 76 dual
&gt; vacuum unit distributor?
&gt;

78 single Vac.

&gt; The rear facing nipple is manifold vacuum for the retard side.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; There is another facing the front that is capped off.
&gt;
&gt; Pointing to the front of the bus? This is ported vacuum for the advance side.
&gt; If you are using the mid-76 and up single vacuum unit dist., it goes to this
&gt; port. Cap the rear facing nipple.
&gt; With no vacuum lines connected, set timing at 7.5 before at idle.
&gt; If you have the dual vacuum dist, connect manifold vacuum to the retard side
&gt; [inboard nipple pointing to the dist] and timing should go to 5 after.
&gt; At idle, you should have zero vacuum at the ported nipple. Connected to the
&gt; advance side [outboard nipple pointing away from the dist] your timing should
&gt; not change at idle.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; This is a 75 FI setup
&gt;
&gt; Just the FI? Or the whole engine/bus?
