Subject: 76-79 transmissions

gang: 

I've a running 76 bus with a 79 engine, and a 79 bus that came with a 76 engine already out. 

My plan: rebuild the 76 and put it in my 76 and vice versa to make both vehicles correct. Obviously the 76 with the 79 motor has no trans/motor compatibility issues, and the research I've done says the transmission was unchanged from 76-79.

Anyone want to back me up?

Billy
