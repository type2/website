Subject: My 77 Transporter,,,,

My 77 Transporter (fuel injected)  gets to about 30 mph. &amp; then starts
chugging like it wants to cut out, I let off the gas alittle, (did I say
it's also a automatic!?!)
to engage the next gear, then accels fine till about 40 mph. then all over
again!
Any suggestions??????
    P.S. Way Sorry for the earlier post, I'm new to the VW &amp; news group
thing!!!!!!
