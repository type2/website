&gt;Hey Volks,
&gt;
&gt;About once a year I like to poll the list and find out what people are
&gt;using for keeping track of gas mileage, repairs, oil changes, etc. on
&gt;their bus. 

I have a logbook that I keep in the bus.  I use it to record fillups,
mileage, oil changes, repairs, etc..  I also have a simple Excel
spreadsheet that I enter the fillup data into to give me all the mileage
stats and charts.  I have never tracked the money I spend on
repairs/upgrades to the bus because I'm sure I would pass out if I knew the
grand total.  :-/
