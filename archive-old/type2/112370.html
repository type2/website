Subject: Seals

My bus is going to the painters in about 4 weeks and I'm about to buy seals. I've decided to reuse the door seals because they pass the &quot;in good condition&quot; test (all except the rear hatch that has cracks) but all window seals are going to be replaced.

I'd appreciate advice from anyone who has recently gone through this process (vendors, fit, etc).
