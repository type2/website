Subject: Re: [T2] new muffler

&gt; I bought and installed a new German stock style muffler on my 71' stock 1600 bus this weekend.  All went very well and the new system sounds great.  The muffler was coated with a grey powdery paint that is in the process of burning off as I drive.  I know that this is normal, but it smells awful.  My concern is that the burning paint smell is coming through the heater system anytime I turn the heater on.  Is this normal?  Will it go away when all the paint is done burning off?  Or, did I screw something up an am now feeding exhaust into my heating system and through my bus?

dont worry about the burning paint.
but i would recommend repainting it with BBQ Black hi temp paint and
respraying it whenever it looks like it needs it. it will help keep it
from rusting sn it will look nicer.
