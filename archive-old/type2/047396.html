Subject: [Fwd: [T2] 1974 VW Safari engine questions/ Auto Tranny 
 rebuildquestions]

&gt; Locally the AAMCO is advertising &quot;free auto tranny check, bring your's in
&gt; for free checkup&quot; and the visual is someone carrying in a transmission and
&gt; ploping it on the counter, welllllll, I have a dead auto tranny sitting in
&gt; the garage,  ;8*}}}}}}}}

&gt; Bob

Remember what they used to say in another tranny place's commercials???

&quot;50% of the transmissions brought to us do NOT need a rebuild.&quot;

Or something to that effect...  Seemed like an awfully high percentage
of total rebuilds...  Scammy.
