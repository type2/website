Subject: Re: [T2] New Camper Interiors

Howdy,
Reading this got me thinking....so I pulled out the original sales paperwork
for my 78 westy deluxe. The &quot;Deluxe Camping Equipment with Pop-Up Top&quot; added
$3050 to the price (the base price was $6050).

For whatever that's worth.

Regards
Chris

&gt; &gt; Boy, I like this idea, having considered redoing my camper interior
&gt; &gt; custom, then I saw the price, then I did the multiplication, choke!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Seems kinda steep for plyboard. I'd be happy even up to a grand, but
&gt; &gt; you're looking at 2,242.50 for the upper end job before shipping it
&gt; &gt; across country. I don't have that furniture value in my living room.
&gt;
&gt; Billy,
&gt;
&gt; Trot on down to Home Depot and price the flat-pack &quot;Mills Pride&quot; kitchen
&gt; cabinets, then over to a furninture store and try to fill your
&gt; house/apartment with furniture similar to what you have now.
&gt;
&gt; Particle board and laminate may be cheap, but case work is *expensive*!
&gt; If you had the choice in the 1970s, the optional Westy package would have
&gt; set you back about what this package will cost you.  I am amazed that they
&gt; kept the cost down as low as they have.
&gt;
&gt; I am looking at and lusting after the latest Westfalia package  (the
&gt; &quot;James Cook&quot;) and figure that it probably will add at least $25,000 to the
&gt; base price of the shell. Compared to $25,000, $2,500 soulds very nice :-)
