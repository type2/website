Subject: Re: [T2] Automatic  trannies

&gt;respondent, everyone loves their automatic for a variety of reasons. Thanks 
&gt;for all who replied- I'm gonna road trip to see the bus in question and
drive 
&gt;it- hopefully I'll own it soon thereafter.

I'll throw in another tidbit, having recently bought a very neat '75-'78
dealer
service manual with a lot of late Bus only info, I am 100% sure the late
automatic is the same unit as in the vanagons.  The final bears the same
P/N and the tranny itself is the standard corporate offering used in
everything
from a '75 rabbit through about a '92 Jetta.  This brings up some points, I'll
bet any '76-'92 Bus or Vanagon tranny will swap directly as a complete unit,
but post '85 or so with ATF coolers might not work unless the cooler would
pysically fit (not being hooked up to anything) in the Bus.  More importantly
I have on three occurences swapped '85-'90 Jetta transmision sections onto
late vanagons and had over 50k miles of service on one of them with no
problems in hilly WV despite the lack of the cooler and the fact the direct
clutch in the Jetta box has one fewer plate.  I would lay odds that if you
needed to you can easily swap most any VW corporate autobox
transmission section only into that bus by replacing only the outer most
planetary ring with the orginial and changing the shift and accelerator
linkages (about a days total swap in my experience and $20 in parts.) 
A full rebuild kit from NAPA is about $175 for the transmission (called
variously 010 or 090 in later years.)  Finally this manual has DETAILED
instructions on the rebuild of this box, missing from the standard Bentley
but frankly nearly identical to the instructions and format in the Vanagon
Bentley with the addition of some very nice troubleshooting tables and
maybe a few more pictures specific to idiosyncracies of the early boxes
(there are detail changes through the years to the apply shells and number
of clutch plates) if anyone would like a copy of the section I'd be willing to
send it for the cost of the copies and a priority pack but to tell the truth
the section in a pre '80 Rabbit Bentley is 100% better written (more in the
old word not picture style) and I used it far more for the only one I've fully
rebuilt.  Anyway, this is a strong reliable box, and is frankly easily
serviced
if you don't let it intimidate you, plus has innumerable swap options.  I
loved it in my '87 and '90, and in itself it is nice in the '82 excepting the
lack of power with the heavy air cooled vanagon camper weight.  I drove a
'78 auto of a friends on a long trip once and with the lighter Bus is was
quite alright.  Any place that can honestly rebuild a rabbit/jetta/golf tranny
section should rebuild the Bus box for the same price in parts though labor
to get it out would be more in a bus, less in a vanagon as compared to those
FWD applications.  The finals should be good for 150-200k with oil changes
as long as ATF doesn't get in the oil.

Don't fear the auto.
