Subject: [T2]Help on timing problem

Hi all

OK, I've got the original engine in a 73 Westy, manual transmission.

According to the bibles, I should be timing it at 5 degrees after TDC, but
it will only work at 16 degrees before???

The PO replaced the dual carbs with a single Weber and replace the dizzy
with a Bosch 009.

Can these changes throw the timing out so much?

My buddy helping me (actually doing all the work while I hand him the tools)
thinks maybe the distributor was not installed properly or maybe the timing
pulley was not installed properly.  I'm pulling my hair out, and there ain't
that much left.

Thanks

Erich
