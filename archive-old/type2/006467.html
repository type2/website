I ran across a guy at the Puyallup WA VW Springmeet last Sunday who was
selling the original equipment Dometic refrigerator, including cabinetry,
out of a 1977 Westfalia.

It's the top-loading version that lives in a cabinet along the driver's side
wall.  Looks to be in good to very good
condition, although the counter/cabinet is a little rough around the edges.
The only defects I could find in the refrigerator itself were a couple of
small cracks in the plastic molding that lines the lid.

If the seller doesn't have to mess with shipping it's available for $100.00.
This is a great deal on a &quot;real&quot; Westy refrigerator setup.  Contact me via
p-mail if you're interested, and I'll provide the seller's contact
information.
