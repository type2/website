I have a 79 Transporter which I have spent both a great deal of time and
money on in the past 14 months or so, and still have the same handling
problems to wrote about in your recent email.  Installing the rear sway bars
was a piece of cake.  Removing the stock front sway bar to the larger after
market sway bar took a little more as the wedges that keep the old front
sway bar bushings in place took allot of WD-40 to break lose.  When you
install the new after market urethane sway bar bushings over the ends of the
new and larger sway bar, its best to put alittle grease on the sway bar ends
and then take a rubber hammer and beat them on.  This will not hurt the
urethane sway bushing.  One thing I did find out after about two weeks was
the noise coming from the bushing when your sway bar moved or traveled
because of road conditions.  Put a small bit of white grease on the urethane
sway bushing before final positioning.  I have also changed to the heavy
duty shocks, KYB's.  As for the &quot;white knuckle&quot; driving your our
experiencing in the wind, I am still facing the same problem.  I have
changed tires twice, and air pressure configurations several times. I have
also adjusted the steering box to give me a more responsive steering.  From
my experiences thus far, this is what I have found out and what I plan to
do.  The first set of tire were automobile tires which didn't work at all. I
went to a 8 ply, 2 ply side wall tire and the tires were/are in reality
trailer tires and that does work.  Thus, I am purchasing some custom 5
x112mm 15 inch x 6 inch rims from California Imports.  They now have a
custom rim that doesn't require any wheel modifications.  Second, I hope to
find some Michelin or other heavy duty tire.  California Imports also has an
adjustable front beam for the 79 Transporter cheaper in cost than any one
else, thus I am planning to get it and then pull that nose down at least 2
and 1/2 inches. I realize this is another &quot;chunk&quot; of money to go into a 79
Transporter, but I have allot in it now.   I rebuilt two Super Beetles for
daughters many years ago.  This 79 Loaf was the first VW I have put my hands
on since the Beetles in 87.  I really enjoy driving it.
