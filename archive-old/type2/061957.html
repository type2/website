Subject: (f) VW vs Detroit

I was on my way to a soccer match with about 8 teammates 
crammed into my '64 deluxe bus.  Lotsa rust, 54MPH max, 90 degrees 
steering wheel freeplay, you know, an average bus.  Anyway we were 
at an intersection waiting for a van lookin piece of detroit steel to 
get out of the way.  It was going to take awhile, it was dead and 
being pushed out of the intersection.  I had converted the interior 
to a camping use so had only the back seat. Everybody was sitting
on the floor or standing as we had the sun-roof open.
VW to the rescue, or at least the passengers.  
We pulled into the intersection to block all traffic and opened the doors.  
A pile of uniformed soccer players poured out of the bus. 
It looked like one of those movie scenes where the cavalry jumps
off the train at full gallop!  YEEHAH, we shoved that hunk outta
the way.  Lots of stares from the onlookers, blocked drivers, and
a few comments on the quantity of people the bus could hold.  
They jumped back in and away we sped, . . . . well at least as 
fast as an tired engined '64 with 9 people COULD go, anyway.
