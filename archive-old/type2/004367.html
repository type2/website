A few people have posted requests for good heads. In the past 2 weeks I have
removed the heads from 14 2.0 engines at the wrecking yards. I have only
found 1 head that didn't have any cracks. All the others either had lost
seats, detonated pistons that ate up the combustion chamber, or cracks. The
cracks were from seat to seat or from the exhaust seat to the spark plug
threads. One had cracks 1/2&quot; long from each side of the plug threads
parallel to the seats!
The one good head had been welded up were the usual cracks were. It is
stamped GEX.

I happened to be looking in Hot VWs, Nov. 99 issue and saw an ad on page 102
for Roger's European Engineering in Downey, Calif. He is offering 1.7, 1.8,
2.0 remanu-
factured heads for $95 exchange. Anybody know anything about them??  For
that price they are either bare or come with non-sodium filled exhaust
valves?
