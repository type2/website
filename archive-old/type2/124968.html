Subject: RE: [T2] cool soldering tool

I bought one _at_ AutoZone for around $20 its good for small jobs... not so
much for larger jobs....

It's Worth the $20 bucks I paid... nice to have in tool box for road side
repairs...

I would not use it as my primary soldering iron in a garage...

has anyone out there bought one of these? If so, is it worth having
in the toolbox?
