Subject: Re: [T2] Re:Re: [T2] Distributor Vacuum Advance(Is this correct)??

Ok I went and played with my van on my lunch break. I found that my throttle 
body wasn't returning all the way at idle, but when I pushed it closed there 
was vacum on the retard side of the vacum can and none on the advance side 
so my hoses are correct.

When I move the plate under the rotor counter clockwise, plug either or both 
holes on the vacum can the plate returns to the original position so I think 
this means the can is bad...correct??

My plan is to replace the vacum can,(maybe points and condenser while I'm in 
there) buy a timing light, make sure the throttle is all the way closed, 
time van to 5 ATDC at idle, enjoy good running van??

Does this sound right?
