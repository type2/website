Rob, don't know what year bus you have, but I have a 70 and i have the same
problem every time. This is the only bus i have ever had so i'm not an expert.
I can't get the engine in or out without removing the rear crossmember. I
don't think anyone else does this but in my case its the only way. You might
check to see if the crossmember is hanging on something. I am new at this
so don't put a lot of stock in what i say.
