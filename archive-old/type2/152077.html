&gt; Ron, all,

&gt; I didn't want to come off as a BD basher, I'm not and have never been.  I'm
&gt; just using the site more now than ever and noticing things more.

and sometimes better is not better,,,...for many of us who don't like the
latest and greatest, or have slow connections, or maybe accessing from a
PDA or cell phone.  fancy is not easier to use.  there really needs to be
a basic button.  for text only and fast downloading...

not to mention it would not pass the W3C/WAI test because the site doesn't
degrade smoothly, heck it doesn't hardly degrade at all.  I find myself
using the site less and less the more complex the site is made. takes
forever to load and half the time I can't input what I need.

now I know that Ron is not a programmer but everyone needs to understand
that not everyone likes, wants, or even can use all the bells and
whistles.  just the facts that's all I want.  don't need pretty, heck in
LYNX (browser) it is black and white anyway.

so 99% of the time I make a long distance phone call to waste Ron's
employee's time answering my questions and getting the right part.  but at
least I get the part and I get it fast.  just as long as Ron remembers
that his business is selling top line VW parts at fair prices I don't care
what else he does...

Bob
