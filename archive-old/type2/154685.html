Subject: Ouch! Well... I did it...

I just ordered a new set of Febi hydraulic lifters for my 1.8. Hopefully that
will take care of my rattly lifter issue. I can tell that at least two of my
lifters are collapsed. I can push the entire lifter in all the way... I
shouldn't be able to do that with or without oil in it, right?

I took everyone's advice, and ordered the Febi instead of the Mayle.


Thanks!

Todd
