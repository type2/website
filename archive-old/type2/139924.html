Subject: Re: Quoted material

The quoted material thing is apparently a setup thing that someone decided
was useful for this particular group. My gripe is that I haven't seen any
documentation for how to get around it. I found out, after posting a
similar query, that you have to delete a bunch of the &gt; signs from most of
the lines and only keep the first one...like I did below.

My other gripe with the list is that, at least in digest mode, when you
hit reply you have to change the email address it goes to because the one
that comes up gets you an error message back from the list program. I am
on other lists that use the same software but don't have either of these
issues.

&gt; PS, how the heck does anyone get a friggin reply through with any quoted
 material in it? (I though I figured it out about 10 times over now but every
 new reply is back to &quot;FAILURE NOTICE&quot;, no wonder I reply so infrequently to
 the list...
