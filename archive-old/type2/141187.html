Subject: Re: [T2] Increasing range

I fitted two custom made stainless steel tanks under my '77, just over 4&quot; 
thick, so only hang as low as the middle chassis rails. One is for water, 
one is for fuel. They each hold ~40L (45 if I fill them to over flowing). So 
in addition to the stock tank get a range of 450-500 miles. Great on long 
trips.
Regards,
Richard
