&gt; Hey folks, what wire off the voltage regulator did VW tap into to close the

I'm not sure, but it would be logical to tap D+, as it will have 14v
present after the generator starts working.

I believe that the DF lead grounds to start the generator.  This isn't
what you want!

I wouldn't suggest tapping into the wire itself.  It would probably be
most convenient to tap in at the voltage regulator.  I'm not sure if there
is a second spade terminal there for this purpose or not.  If not, you
could also tap the terminal on the generator itself.

In any case, be sure that you make good workmanlike connections.  Don't
just slap it together with crimp terminals or (gad) scotchlock connectors.

Take the time to make good soldered connections and use shrink-tubing to
insulate the terminals.  Remember that these wires are going to be &quot;hot&quot;
&gt;from high-current sources, so if anything shorts to ground you're going to
get a lot of smoke.
