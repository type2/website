Subject: Re: [T2] Pop top hold downs

What he said, plus the following:

When I redid my hold downs, I bought 3 of the black rubber replacements from
Bus Depot.  Turns out, the rubber parts are the same for all three hold
downs, it's the metal parts that are different.  Even on the side hold
downs, the metal parts of the new hold downs didn't quite fit.  So, I
drilled out the rivets that hold the metal parts to the rubber parts on the
new and old hold downs, and swapped stuff around so I had the old metal
parts on the new rubber parts, which I re-assembled using the appropriate
size screws and nuts.  Looks good, works good.

Hi all,
Just a quick question.
I was on the phone with BusDepot recently purchasing, among other =
things, pop top hold downs, (you know, those little rubber &amp; metal =
things that keep the top from flying away.)
Well, on my '72 Westy there are 3 of them.  According to the guy at =
BusDepot, all 3 hold downs
are *exactly* the same.  But on my bus, the 2 side ones are the same and =
the 3rd one, nearest=20
the luggage rack, is different.
Can someone clear this up?  Is the Depot wrong?  If so, where can I get =
this 3rd/different hold down?
Thanks,
-Paul
-'72 Westy

 I had the same problem. They ARE different AND the originals on a 72 are a
grey or off white color. The ones you can get aftermarket today are black.
If you aren't restoring its no big deal. Another thing (off topic) is the
water filler tube. Aftermarket ones are grey and they should be white.

Your only hope is to find a donor bus with good ones. It is tough to find a
rear pop top hold down thats not dry rotted. If you find one you can
probably pick me up some original curtains too!!  :)
