&gt;I have often thought that It would be nice to go back to the smoother dual
&gt;advance/vac retard dizzy. There is a vac port on the manifold for advance
&gt;and a vac port on the Weber 32/36 that could be uncapped for the retard.
&gt;The question is do I need retard? Recent posts argue that vac retard is only
&gt;for emissions and does not affect performance.

You can live without it.  The later FI busses don't have it.

&gt;Now  this is where I need a &quot;list&quot; reality check. Let's all turn in our
&gt;Bentley's to Section 5 page 75.  If I am reading this correctly..........
&gt;
&gt;Vacuum timing range from Bentley Sec5 page 75 table J
&gt;Set the timing at 5 atdc with hoses on. At idle, vac from the carb holds the
&gt;timing at 5atdc.

Actually it is vacuum from the manifold.

&gt;As the throttle is applied the vac retard decreases and
&gt;allows the timing to advance aprox 11 to 15 from its starting point of
&gt;5atdc. This would put timing at 6 to 10dgrs btdc.

Yep.

&gt;Vac from the manifold is
&gt;now taking over and advancing the timing a further 8 to 12 dgrs for a
&gt;current sub total of 14 to 22 dgrs btdc.(This cannot be right.)

Again, backwards.  Vac from the *carb* is taking over.  And the 14-22
degrees figure sounds correct (I don't have Bentley in front of me).

&gt;No RPMs are
&gt;listed in this part of the table because vacuum is doing the work. It would
&gt;seem logical that as the advance that is driven by vacuum action is
&gt;increasing the mechanical (centrifugal advance) is kicking in.

Yep again.

&gt;I dont think
&gt;my math is correct here. Retard vac is coming off the carb and advance is
&gt;coming off the manifold.

It's the other way around.

&gt;Let's move to the centrifugal timing range which does have RPMs listed in 4
&gt;columns. Again this is for the 021 905 205 E.
&gt;In the third column we have listed 2000 RPM 13-16dgrs. In the fourth column
&gt;which is titled 'END' we have 3600 RPM 23-26dgrs. It appears that vacuum
&gt;advance begins to wane  at 8- 12 dgrs(this makes more sense ) of advance and
&gt;mechanical picks up takes over in the 13-16 degree range(at 2000rpm) and
&gt;tops out at 23-26dgrs at 3600 rpm.
&gt;
&gt;I am inclined to believe that &quot;End / 3600 rpms 23-26 degrees is the total
&gt;amount of advance .  But 26dgrs from where? certainly not from 5 atdc that
&gt;would put spark at 21 btdc and that cant be right. Some folks have told me
&gt;that it is 26 from where the retard gives out which would put spark at 37 to
&gt;41 degrees btdc and that seems kinda high.

It is definately not from 5 ATDC.  I would agree with the folks that say it
is where the retard gives out.  It does seem kind of high but that is how
much total advance my engine has always had, and I have verified that power
falls off fast if the engine is run with less advance.
