Subject: Re: [T2] Possible to elimate the power brake servo?

I just noticed something I missed in the original post. You said you didn't
know if the servo was good or not. Check it out. If you apply a vacuum and it
holds, you're good to go. Master cylinder for a 71 is a heck of a sight
cheaper than for a 68. If the servo is good, install new vacuum lines, check
out the drums, rotors, calipers, etc. and replace the brake lines at all four
corners as they have likely collaped internally giving you permanent parking
brakes when you first use them, adjust them up, flush the hell out of them,
and go. Still way cheaper than replacing the entire braking system, or just
the master cylinder for that matter. Oh, don't forget the one way check valve
in the vacuum line. They're cheap. Blow in one side then the other. If it
flows one way and not the other, it's good. Don't leave it out. Prevents the
occasional backfire from ruining your servo.
