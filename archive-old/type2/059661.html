Whoa whoa whoa!

Do I see that in the UK they have German Heat Exchangers for US$165 a pair?
I thought these were NLA.

I'm in for 2 pairs if we want to do a group import purchase.  Anyone know
how we can get these in the USA for US$200 pair with shipping?

way!

Several of the British have proudly informed me that the pound is BIGGER
than the dollar so these carbs are more like $165. I thought maybe I
smelled blood there for a minute but never mind. 8)
