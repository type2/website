Help!

I'm overhauling my camper's engine (a 2 litre Type 4 engine, 79 UK spec
with carburettors and square exhaust ports).

One of the jobs is to replace the large oil seal behind the flywheel. I've
got the clutch, flywheel et al off okay, and I've carefully scraped most of
the seal off using a knife, but the outer part of the rubber ring is firmly
stuck between the crankcase and that funny metal ring (is it a seal
retainer or something?).

Now, do you have to split the crankcase to get his seal out, or can I do it
without having to? If so, how? I've had a look in the archives, with no
specific info. MY Haynes manual says it is possible, but doesn't say how.

Thanks in advance, 

Paul
