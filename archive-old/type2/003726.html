&gt;And Sean, your description of Steve's problem is very close to my own. I
keep
&gt;thinking my ignition switch is worn out, but maybe it has something to do
with
&gt;wiring...or maybe that worn solenoid has some impact on the FI
system...like maybe
&gt;there's not enough voltage coming in to part of the FI system to trigger a
critical
&gt;event?


Well everyone before they look for a trend here should realize that the FI
wiring on Steve's '73 conversion is somewhere between abomination,
terrifying, unsafe, or just plain unholy around the double relay and fuel
pump area.  Nothing about what that bus does should be overly suprising,
cept that most times it seems to run.
