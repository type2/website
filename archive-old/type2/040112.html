Gloss black.  I have one bus that still is gloss black, and another with the
custom rust color : )

Bussers,
The top of my dashboard, the metal part where the vents are and the speaker
grille is, is faded after 30 years.  I'm going to paint it while the
windshield is out.  Black or charcoal grey? Flat, semi or high gloss?
Thanks.
