Subject: Engine Ideas...

I'm looking for ideas for the engine I'm having built for my bus. I have a
1971 Riviera camper. I'll be getting a trailer hitch and pulling a very
small pop up camper. Don't ask.. it's for my wife!

I'm not going to be driving much faster than the speed limit. I don't need a
race engine. I DO need an engine that will have enough pulling power that I
won't need to shift to first gear going up a hill pulling this trailer. 

My thoughts are an 1835 with low compression. I want to be able to burn
regular fuel. I don't want it to overheat. I want the engine to last awhile.
I don't want to have to spend a fortune on special oil coolers. 

My questions are:

1. What engine configuration would you recommend for this situation.

2. Who should I get to build this engine.

I've heard all about the GEX problems. I'll probably not use them. I've got
a local guy that built the engine in the bus I'm running right now. I'll be
calling him and quizzing him. I'd just like to get some other points of view.

Thanks for your thoughts.
