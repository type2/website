Subject: Fwd: [T2] 34pict3 idle and wacky RPM readings

Have you experimented with jet sizes?


&gt;My experience is that some - make that most - 34PICT-3s just are not
&gt;tunable.  A month of frustration with swapping these around sent me
&gt;to The Samba for a pair of dual carbs.  When the weather allows, I
&gt;intend to remove the 34 and run these.
&gt;
&gt;Sorry I don't have a solution. I hope others do.
&gt;
