Subject: Re: [T2] Empty shell

shannon,
i would say as a shell, probably not a lot, maybe $100
or so.  but in pieces you might be able to get a
little more.  if the doors, hatch, or any panels are
in good shape they would probably sell better in
pieces as opposed to a whole.  you can sell anything,
lights, door handles, wiper motors etc etc.   even the
smallest pieces seem to find a buyer especially on
places like Eb_at_y.  of course it would be nice to offer
any decent parts to the wonderful list first:)  just a
thought as i know there are some Eb_at_y haters out there
so no flames please, just a thought.  good luck

&gt; I used it to fix up

&gt; no dash, a cracked 
&gt; windshield, and some body damage (mainly the rear
&gt; corners).  What, if 
&gt; anything, could I expect to sell this for?
