Subject: RE: [T2] repacking cv joints / westie fridge

     I replaced one of the CV's on my bus a couple of weeks ago. Believe it 
or not, it was pretty easy.  A bit time consuming but I didn't find it hard 
at all.  There is a great write-up on this in the library, it's actually for 
servicing not replacing but it's the same basic deal:
http://volksweb.relitech_dot_com/cvjoints.htm
     Sometimes the CV joint will slide right off and right on the shaft, 
sometimes not.  Mine needed a little urging so I used a brass drift to tap 
on either side of the inner race of the CV to get it off.  To get it on I 
found a deep socket that just fit the inner race and carefully smacked it on 
with a hammer.  Be careful not to hit anything but the inner race.  The 
tools are fairly easy to find.  It will require a 6mm allen wrench, or a 12 
point &quot;triple square&quot; depending on the year.  If it's the latter that can be 
harder to find but I think most FLAPS caries them.  I'd Also recommended 
(but not absolutely required):

A pair of circlip pliers that pry the clip open
A brass drift
A socket about the size of the inner race
Torque wrench

     The grease is just high pressure high heat molybdenum grease which can 
be found at your FLAPS, but if you buy the Bus Depot CV joint replacement 
kit:
http://www.busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=251598101
     It comes with the new boot, the CV, and a packet of grease.  The grease 
is messy as hell.  The write-up tells you how to grease the new CV after 
it's on the shaft, but I don't like this method personally because I am 
never confident I got the grease all the way in the CV.  I prefer to grease 
it by hand before I put it on the shaft.  If you have never greased a 
bearing by hand before, this is how I do it.  Take that packet of grease and 
squirt a big blob in your left hand, toward the front.  Take up the CV in 
your right hand.  Press the open side of the CV that you are not holding 
firmly down into the grease in your left hand and pull away from the blob.  
This will start to sort of scoop up the grease into the assembly.  Continue 
to do this, adding more grease to your blob as you go.  The grease will 
eventually work its way all the way through the CV and start peaking up 
through the top.  When that happens, rotate the CV and start working another 
section.  Eventually you will have fully packed the bearing with grease all 
the way through.  If your good at this you can quickly pack wheel bearings 
and CV's and such with almost no mess.  It takes me a little while and I 
usually end up greased to my elbows :-)  The downside to this method as 
opposed to the one in the article is that you now have a greasy CV to handle 
and manipulate onto a shaft, so you may opt for the other way.
