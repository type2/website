Subject: '69 electrical (brake/turnsignal light) problem

All,


Geeze! I finally went out to deal with the right
brakelight ('69 Westy) not working, only to find that
the right-rear turn-signal is now on the fritz as
well!

The tailight and the emergency flasher *does* work,
however.

I've cleaned all the post-connections on the tailight
housing and replaced the female connectors on all 4
wires, but still no go.

I'm gonna go check the brake-light switch now, but any
ideas on the turn-signal??? Relay? I hope it's
something stupid, as the Bentley relay test procedure
seems a little jiggy (electrical is not my cup of
tea).

Also, the turn-signal switch was brand-new about 2
years ago, so I doubt that's it either.
