&gt;After reading everyone's advise, I think I need to take a deep breath and
&gt; start from the beginning.  Over this next week I am going to start with
&gt; some basics.
&gt;
&gt; I have a Bentley manual and plan to do all the work myself.
&gt;
&gt; I'll repost when once I get some &quot;basic&quot; information from the above steps.
&gt;  On a side note, I'm a Java programmer by trade and purchased the bus to
&gt; learn about cars.  My wife is a VW fanatic from birth and is also loving
&gt; the bus.  My kids (one is 5 the other 18 months) think &quot;Bess the Bus&quot; is
&gt; COOL.  So......  She will run again!  I will fix her and be my own best
&gt; mechanic in the process.
